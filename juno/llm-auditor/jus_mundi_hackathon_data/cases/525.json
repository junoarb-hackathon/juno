The parties will be hereinafter referred to as \"Perenco\", \"Ecuador\" and \"Petroecuador\".\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute between the parties concerns two Participation Contracts to which Perenco became a party on 4 September 2002. One of these is a Participation Contract for Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon Region (\"the Block 21 Participation Contract\") and the other is the Contract Modifying the Service Contract to a Participation for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 7 of the Amazon Region, including the Contract for the Coca-Payamino Unified Field (\"the Block 7 Participation Contract\"). These will be referred to as \"the Participation Contracts\". Perenco also entered into Joint Operating Agreements with the other entities holding interests in Blocks 7 and 21. It is now the sole operator and majority holder of Participating Contract rights in both Blocks, holding a 53.7% interest in Block 21 and a 57.50% interest in Block 7. The remaining interest in both Blocks is now held by Burlington Resources Oriente Limited (\"Burlington\"), with which Perenco has formed a Consortium.\n\n3.\n\nUnder the Participation Contracts the Consortium has the right and duty to carry out oil exploration and production activities in the areas to which the contracts relate. Pursuant to the contracts Perenco contends that it has invested large sums in personnel, equipment, machinery, technology, infrastructure and goods and services. This contention has not at this stage been investigated, but it is not understood to be in dispute.\n\n4.\n\nUnder the Participation Contracts Perenco was to be entitled to a share of the oil produced in the two Blocks. A share was also allotted to Ecuador. The size of the parties' respective shares was defined in section 8.1 of each of the Contracts according to a prescribed formula. The formula provided that as the volume of production rose, the percentage share of Ecuador would increase to a specified extent and that of Perenco decrease. The Contracts made no express reference to the sale price or value of the oil produced.\n\n5.\n\nDuring the currency of the Participation Contracts the price of oil rose.\n\n6.\n\nOn 1 March 2006 the President of Ecuador submitted a bill to Congress proposing an amendment of the Hydrocarbon Law (\"the HCL\"). Congress enacted this bill, known as \"Law 42\", on 19 April 2006. This added to the HCL an article which provided (in translation provided by the Claimant):\n\n\" Participation of the State in surplus prices from the sale of oil and gas not agreed upon or not foreseen.\n\nContractor companies that maintain participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in effect with the Ecuadorian state under this Law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil subject to participation that corresponds to them, when the effective monthly medium price of FOB sale of Ecuadorian oil petroleum goes above the monthly average prices in effect at the time of the execution of the contract, expressed in constant prices for the month of liquidation, will recognize in favour of the Ecuadorian state a participation of at least 50% of the extraordinary income generated by the difference in price. For the purposes of this Article, extraordinary revenues shall be understood to mean the difference in the above-described price, multiplied by the number of barrels produced.\n\nThe price of crude oil as of the date of the contract used as a reference for calculation of the difference shall be adjusted, considering the Consumer Price Index of the United States of America, published by the Central Bank of Ecuador\".\n\nThe Participation Contracts made no reference to the monthly average FOB price of Ecuadorian oil at the time of the execution of the Contracts and did not allot Ecuador a participation of as much as 50% in the price or value of any of the oil produced.\n\n7.\n\nEcuador's Ministry of Mines and Petroleum notified Perenco of the prices said to have been in effect at the time of execution of each of the Participation Contracts. These prices, adjusted for inflation, were thereafter treated as \"the reference prices\": Ecuador's increased participation was, under Law 42, in revenues from all sales above the reference prices.\n\n8.\n\nOn 11 July 2006, the Government of Ecuador issued Decree No 1672 to implement Law 42. This set the percentage of the \"extraordinary income\" payable to the State at 50%. Payments were to be made monthly.\n\n9.\n\nIn a decision of the Constitutional Court of Ecuador published in the Official Register No 350 dated 6 September 2006, Law 42 was held to be constitutional.\n\n10.\n\nOn 4 October 2007 Ecuador issued Decree No 662. This amended Decree No 1672 by substituting 99% for 50% as the percentage of extraordinary income payable to the State. Thus on oil sales at prices above the reference prices Ecuador became entitled, according to quantity, to the agreed contractual percentage of the price up to the reference prices and to 99% of the sale price of oil sold above that price.\n\n11.\n\nUntil the end of April 2008 Perenco made the payments required under Law 42 without prejudice to its rights and under protest. Meanwhile, the parties attempted to negotiate a compromise solution, but on 12 April 2008 the President of Ecuador announced that he had stopped further negotiations. Following that announcement, Perenco on 30 April requested arbitration. Burlington had, on 21 April 2008, made a similar request. Since then it has withheld payment of sums required under Law 42. In a letter dated 19 June 2008 to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador, Perenco expressed willingness to transfer the disputed Law 42 payments into an escrow account maintained by an independent escrow agent in a neutral location pending resolution of the dispute, but this offer was not accepted.\n\n12.\n\nThere were protracted negotiations in the closing months of 2008, but these did not lead to a settlement. On 21 January 2009 the Minister of Mines and Petroleum announced that negotiations to have Perenco continue operating in Ecuador had become \"practically impossible\" and that the Government would now seek early termination of the Participation Contracts. He said the Government was going towards termination of the contracts, and would see whether the wells should be permanently closed, or left on stand-by or taken over by Ecuador.\n\n13.\n\nOn 14 February 2009 the President of Ecuador announced that he had ordered \"coercive measures\" against Perenco and Burlington because they had \"not paid their taxes on extraordinary gains (due to the high price of crude)\". He was reported as saying (in translation) that \"these companies can go wherever they like. This country will not pay attention to extra-regional authorities that attempt to tell us what to do or not to do\". The Minister of Mines and Petroleum told Reuters that the companies would \"either pay the debt or their stuff will be seized\".\n\n14.\n\nOn 19 February 2009 Ecuador issued two enforcement notices against Perenco (known as *coactivas*), one in the sum of US$171,782,211.00 and the other in the sum of US$155,685,236.00. In material part the notices read, in translation (provided by the Claimant),\n\n\"Given that the aforementioned debt is liquid, specific and past due, the debtor is ordered to pay within THREE DAYS or to supply within the same amount of time equivalent goods for attachment, being notified that the goods to be attached will be equivalent to the debt, interest and costs *...\"*\n\nUnder the law of Ecuador such notices may be challenged if the full sum claimed is deposited. By that law three such notices must be issued before enforcement action is taken. On 22 February 2009 two further notices were issued and served and on 25 February 2009 the third and final *coactiva* notices were issued and served on Perenco.\n\n15.\n\nOn Thursday 26 February 2009 the Minister of Mines and Petroleum was reported as saying that the deadline for Perenco to pay US $327 million would end (in translation provided by the Claimant) \"next Monday\", *i.e.* 2 March 2009. He indicated that legal action against Perenco would continue.\n\n16.\n\nOn 3 March 2009 the Court of Enforcement of Petroecuador ordered the seizure of the production and shipments of Napo Crude that were the property of Perenco, as stipulated in the Participation Contract for Block 21, until such time as the entire amount of Perenco's debt had been settled.\n\n***The arbitration***\n---------------------\n\n17.\n\nBriefly summarised, Perenco's central complaint in its Request for Arbitration is that, on becoming party to the Participation Contracts, it acquired certain enforceable and potentially valuable contractual rights; that in reliance on those rights it invested large sums in the exploration for and production of oil in Ecuador; that Ecuador, by enacting and giving effect to Law 42, radically and unilaterally altered, to the disadvantage of Perenco, the terms on which Perenco had agreed to operate and had operated in Ecuador; and that such alteration violated the terms of both the Participation Contracts and the Investment Treaty between the Governments of France and Ecuador (Agreement between the Government of the Republic of France and the Government of the Republic of Ecuador concerning the reciprocal encouragement and protection of investments), which had come into force on 10 June 1996.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondents, as they are entitled to do, have expressly reserved the right to challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to entertain this claim. They have made no admissions concerning, and do not accept the characterisation of, the facts asserted by Perenco. They have made plain their rejection of the validity of Perenco's complaint.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal has formed, and expresses, no opinion on its jurisdiction to entertain this claim, on the facts so far as these are in dispute, or on the merits of the claim. These issues are not before it for decision at this stage and have not been the subject of argument.\n\n**Perenco's application for provisional measures**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration dated 30 April 2008 Perenco requested provisional measures in these terms:\n\n\"43 In order to preserve Perenco's rights under the Treaty until the dispute has been adjudicated on the merits, Perenco requests the Tribunal to order provisional measures pursuant to Arbitration Rule 39. Pursuant to paragraph 1 of that Rule, Perenco hereby specifies: (a) the rights to be preserved; (b) the measures the recommendation of which is requested; and (c) the circumstances that require such measures:\n\n(a) The rights to be preserved. As shown above, Perenco holds acquired rights of substantial value under the Participation Contracts, including the right to receive in full its contractually agreed participation and to enjoy the economic benefit of the sale of that participation.\n\n(b) The measures the recommendation of which is requested. Perenco respectfully requests that, until it has rendered an award on the merits, the Tribunal enjoin Respondents from: (i) pursuing any action to collect any payments Respondents claim are owed by Perenco pursuant to the HCL Amendment [Law 42]; and (ii) unilaterally amending, rescinding, terminating or repudiating the Participation Contracts or any term(s) thereof.\n\n(c) The circumstances that require such measures. As described above, Respondents demand monthly payments from Perenco pursuant to the HCL Amendment [Law 42]. As the *City Oriente* tribunal held in another ICSID arbitration involving the HCL Amendment [Law 42], such payment demands may \"deprive[e] claimant of its lawful right to have its interests effectively protected\". In addition, if Respondents were to act on their threat to repudiate the Participation Contracts, the resulting harm to Perenco would be irreparable. Unless Respondents are enjoined from taking the above measures, it will therefore become significantly more difficult for the Tribunal to grant effective relief to Perenco\".\n\n21.\n\nDuring the first session of the Tribunal, held on 7 February 2009 at the seat of the Centre in Washington DC, in the presence of the parties' counsel, Perenco did not then pursue its application for provisional measures but indicated that it would do so if settlement negotiations proved fruitless and coercive action were taken against it. The Respondents expressed the hope that a settlement could be agreed.\n\n22.\n\nBy letter dated 18 February 2009 to the Tribunal, the Respondents' counsel confirmed that negotiations with Perenco had not reached a satisfactory conclusion and continued (in translation provided by counsel for the Respondents):\n\n\"Accordingly, the President and Minister of Mines and Petroleum of Ecuador have had no other alternative but to announce - in strict compliance with International Law, the Constitution, the laws and decrees of Ecuador - that a 'coercive procedure' will be promptly initiated - the result of which can be challenged before the Ecuadorian civil courts -against Perenco to demand that it pay the amounts it still owes pursuant to the obligations arising out of the application of Law 2006-42 and its regulatory decrees.\"\n\nThe first *coactiva* notices were issued and served the following day (see paragraph 14 above), 19 February 2009.\n\n23.\n\nOn 19 February Perenco submitted its Application for Provisional Measures. It asked the Tribunal to enjoin the Respondents from forcibly collecting any of the Law 42 assessments in dispute in the arbitration and otherwise to preserve the *status quo* pending resolution of the claim. It contended that the request was urgent since the Respondents would begin seizing Perenco's assets in three days' time unless Perenco paid the Respondents US$324 million [sic] in disputed Law 42 assessments. Reference was made to the President's announcement on 14 February (see paragraph 13 above), to the Respondents' letter of 18 February (paragraph 22 above) and to the first two *coactiva* notices served on 19 February (paragraph 14 above). Perenco asked the Tribunal to act swiftly to prevent aggravation of the dispute, impairment of the rights Perenco was seeking to enforce in the arbitration and interference with the Tribunal's ability to grant effective relief. Since forcible collection measures could take effect within three days, Perenco requested the Tribunal to issue immediately an order in the nature of a temporary restraint prohibiting Ecuador from undertaking any measures pending determination of the application for provisional measures. Perenco contended, citing authority, that provisional measures were appropriate when necessary to prevent aggravation of the dispute or further injury to the party seeking the measures. Particular reliance was placed on the decisions of an ICSID Tribunal in *City Oriente Limited v Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)* (ICSID Case No ARB/06/21), Decision on Provisional Measures (19 November 2007), para 55, and Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures (13 May, 2008), para 72. If provisional measures were not granted, the very contractual and international law rights that were the subject of the arbitration would be impaired, probably irreversibly, and the Tribunal's ability to grant full relief would be compromised. Perenco further contended that provisional measures were necessary to preserve the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal in accordance with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. If the Respondents seized Perenco's bank accounts, equipment, property and other assets Perenco could not operate and would be put out of business. The sum demanded from Perenco included not only Law 42 assessments which it had withheld but also those withheld by its Consortium partner, Burlington. If the Blocks were not continuously operated, permanent damage could be done to them, and the Tribunal could not then restore Perenco to its original position.\n\n24.\n\nPerenco accordingly requested the Tribunal to enjoin the Respondents from:\n\n\"(a) Demanding that [Perenco] pay any amounts allegedly due pursuant to Law 42;\n\n(b) Instituting or further pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, including the actions described in the February 19, 2009 notices, to collect any payments Respondents claim are owed by [Perenco] pursuant to Law 42;\n\n(c) Instituting or pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, against [Perenco] or any of its officers or employees, arising from or in connection with the Participation Contracts; and\n\n(d) Unilaterally amending, rescinding, terminating, repudiating or [engaging] in any other conduct that may directly or indirectly affect or alter the legal situation under the Participation Contracts, as agreed upon by the parties.\"\n\n25.\n\nIn a letter to the Tribunal dated 20 February 2009, Ecuador addressed Perenco's request of the day before for provisional measures and its application for a temporary restraining order pending determination of its request. Ecuador pointed out that under Rule 39(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal's power to recommend provisional measures was subject to its having first given each party \"an opportunity of presenting its observations\". Ecuador agreed that a procedural schedule be established for the provisional measures phase, and proposed a timetable culminating in a hearing on 13 May 2009. By applying for temporary relief, Ecuador said, Perenco was seeking to circumvent the restriction which Rule 39(4) imposed on exercise of the Article 47 power. Perenco was seeking on an interim basis the very same orders for which it had applied in its request for provisional measures, without offering the Respondents any substantive opportunity to present their observations in response, and asking for an order \"immediately\". The Tribunal had no power to make those orders under Article 47 and Rule 39 and Perenco had not identified any source of power for the orders which it sought other than those contained in those two provisions. Neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules contained a power analogous to that in the Rules of Court of the International Court of Justice, which expressly authorized the President of the Court to make interim orders pending the outcome of a request for provisional measures. In only one instance - the *City Oriente v Ecuador* case cited by Perenco - had an ICSID Tribunal purported to deal with a request for an interim or temporary restraining order without hearing from the respondent. In that case the Tribunal, without hearing from Ecuador and five days after a request for \"immediate\" relief by the claimant, declined to make the orders sought and instead issued a \"request\" for the parties to maintain the *status quo* pending a determination by the Tribunal of the request for provisional measures. The Tribunal added that\n\n\"If either party intends to take any measure that may violate the provisions set forth herein, prior notice must be served on the Tribunal, granting enough time so that the Tribunal may proceed as appropriate\" (translation provided by counsel for the Respondents).\n\nEcuador did not accept that the Tribunal had the power to make any \"request\" for the maintenance of the *status quo* to the government of a sovereign state charged with the obligation to apply its validly enacted laws. Nor was there any urgency for it to do so. Under Ecuadorian law, a notice of debt was required to be served on Perenco three times, and it was only after the expiry of three days from the final notice that any action could be taken to seize assets in satisfaction of an extant debt. Perenco was likely to be served with a second notice that day (Friday, 20 February). Since Monday and Tuesday of the following week (23 and 24 February) were holidays, the earliest that a third notice would be served was Wednesday, 25 February, and the three days for satisfaction of the debt would expire on the evening of Monday, 2 March. Ecuador understood that during this time the parties would continue to engage in discussions aimed at settlement. Ecuador recalled that at the first session on 7 February it had undertaken to inform the Tribunal of any changes in the *status quo*, and had done so by letter dated 18 February (paragraph 22 above) as soon as possible following a decision to commence the *coactiva* procedure. It now undertook to serve prior notice on the Tribunal, granting enough time for the Tribunal to act as necessary, before it would take any measure seeking to enforce the debts claimed in the first two *coactiva* notices issued on 19 February. Ecuador accordingly submitted that the only action the Tribunal need take in the existing circumstances was to fix a schedule for the briefing of Perenco's request for provisional measures.\n\n26.\n\nIn a letter to the Tribunal dated 21 February, Perenco responded to Ecuador's letter of 20 February, contending that the Tribunal had power under the Convention and the Rules to grant a temporary restraint, contending that Ecuador had had an opportunity to present its observations (which it had begun to do in its 20 February letter) and that in some situations, such as those obtaining here, it was necessary for a tribunal to grant a temporary restraint in order to preserve its ability to grant effective provisional relief. The letter repeated that Perenco could not continue to operate if its oil, working capital, equipment and other assets were seized. The Tribunal could not wait until May, by which time the application would have become moot.\n\n27.\n\nEcuador wrote to the Tribunal on 24 February drawing attention to a recent order in the Burlington arbitration. In its letter Ecuador stated:\n\n\"We can also confirm, as [Perenco] knows, that neither Ecuador nor Petroecuador have commenced proceedings towards termination of the Blocks 7 and 21 participation contracts.\"\n\nBy a letter of 23 February, Petroecuador had given notice confirming its agreement with the State's position.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter to the parties dated 24 February 2009 the Tribunal referred to the parties' recent communications and said:\n\n\"The Tribunal has carefully considered the situation described in the parties' above-mentioned communications and has deliberated on this matter by telephone and email.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in the last paragraph of its February 24 letter, Ecuador ' confirm[s]... that neither Ecuador nor PetroEcuador have commenced proceedings towards termination of the Blocks 7 and 21 participation contracts'. The Tribunal also observes that in its communication of February 23, PetroEcuador has aligned itself with Ecuador's position. The Tribunal notes with approval the Respondents' assurances.\n\nThe Tribunal believes it is necessary nonetheless, to request the parties to refrain from initiating or continuing any action or adopting any measure which may, directly or indirectly, modify the *status quo* between the parties *vis-\u00e1-vis* the participation contracts, including any attempt to seize any asset of [Perenco], until it has had an opportunity to further hear from the parties on the question of provisional measures.\"\n\nThe Tribunal proposed to hold a hearing on provisional measures on 19 March 2009. On 26 February 2009 Ecuador noted the Tribunal's request, but advised that it could not guarantee that seizures would not commence by 3 March 2009.\n\n29.\n\nEcuador's Reply to Perenco's Application for Provisional Measures was dated 26 February. It reserved its position on jurisdiction and the facts. It accepted that *coactiva* notices had been served on 19, 22 and 25 February (paragraph 14 above) and that accordingly the Consortium would be obliged within three working days (*i.e.*, by 2 March 2009) to pay the debt due or face the risk that the debt would be collected through, amongst other things, the seizure of assets in a value equivalent to the debt asserted, plus interest and costs. In a cogent and well-argued pleading Ecuador contended that the recognised test for the grant of provisional measures, well-attested by authority, was that they were urgent and necessary to prevent a party suffering irreparable loss, *i.e.* loss which could not be adequately remedied by an award of damages if it were successful at the merits stage. The burden was on Perenco to prove such urgent necessity, and it could not do so. It was the more important that the test was fully satisfied if a sovereign State were to be restrained from implementing its validly enacted laws.\n\n30.\n\nIn resisting Perenco's application, Ecuador placed particular reliance on two points. The first was a statement by Burlington in its separate ICSID arbitration that\n\n\"[t]he Consortium has been paying all amounts under Law No 2006-42 into two segregated US accounts (one for each of the members of the Consortium). To date the Consortium has deposited US $327.4 million in its US segregated accounts (US $171.7 million for Block 7 and US $155.7 million for Block 21)\".\n\nThe second point was Perenco's right under the law of Ecuador to challenge the *coactiva* notices on depositing the sum in dispute. These points made clear that Perenco's alleged predicament was of its own making since it could resolve its problem by paying the sum already held in a segregated US account either to Ecuador (to abide the event of the arbitration) or to the court. Ecuador pointed out that in its Request for Arbitration Perenco had complained that Ecuador had \"expropriated\" \"Perenco's interests in the Participation Contracts without paying any compensation, and cited the decision of an ICSID tribunal in *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and another v Ecuador* (ICSID Case No ARB/06/11), Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, for the proposition that provisional measures would not be granted where a harm suffered by a claimant was greater damages. Perenco's reliance on Article 26 of the ICSID Convention was without merit, since that article did not preclude an investor from pursuing relief before local courts so long as the claims in question were distinct in nature from those to be asserted before the ICSID tribunal. No steps had been taken to terminate the Participation Contracts, and there was no suggestion that any proceedings, civil or criminal, had been or were threatened against Perenco or its officers and directors.\n\n31.\n\nOn 27 February Perenco again wrote to the Tribunal, noting its \"request\" and inviting it to make a \"recommendation\" under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal on the same day told the parties that it regretted the stance adopted by Ecuador and that it would have to take a serious view of any failure to comply with its \"request\".\n\n32.\n\nIn its Reply on Provisional Measures dated 27 February 2009, Perenco complained that the service of the third and final *coactiva* notices appeared to violate both Ecuador's undertaking on 20 February to inform the Tribunal before taking any measure to enforce recovery of the disputed Law 42 payments (paragraph 25 above) and the Tribunals \"request\" of 24 February that the parties refrain from \"initiating or continuing any action. which may, directly or indirectly, modify the *status quo* between the parties *vis-\u00e1-vis* the participation contracts, including any attempt to seize any assets of [Perenco]\". Perenco now faced the seizure of its assets on 2 March, which would put it out of business.\n\n33.\n\nPerenco challenged the proposition that a prospect of irreparable harm had invariably to be shown before provisional measures would be granted, but contended that the test was in any event satisfied on the present facts. It contended that it should not have to choose between making the disputed payments and being shut down, but further challenged the factual basis of Ecuador's contention that it could resolve its problem by paying over the sum of $327 million allegedly held in a US account, since that figure represented payments required (by Law 42) from both members of the Consortium (Burlington as well as Perenco) and Perenco had no power or authority to make payments on behalf of Burlington. Since Perenco could only suspend the forcible collection process by posting a bond for the full amount said to be due from it and Burlington with the Ecuadorian court, which it could not do, it would in any event be infringing the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal, in breach of Article 26 of the Convention, since it would be engaging in an adversarial process regarding the rights at issue in the arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nOn 3 March 2009 (paragraph 16 above) steps were taken to seize assets of Perenco.\n\n35.\n\nIn view of further letters received from the parties, the Tribunal emailed a letter to the parties dated 5 March 2009 in which it quoted from its letter of 24 February (paragraph 28 above) and said:\n\n\"The Tribunal wishes to make it clear, in view of the parties' most recent exchange of correspondence, that its February 24, 2009 *request* had and continues to have the same authority as a *recommendation*, as envisaged in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39\".\n\n36.\n\nEcuador's Rejoinder to Perenco's Application for Provisional Measures was dated 6 March 2009. It emphasised that provisional measures may be ordered only if they are necessary and urgent. The test is one of irreparable prejudice. Substantial prejudice is not enough. They should not be ordered where a party, if ultimately successful, would be adequately compensated by damages. Here, Perenco could be so compensated. By complaining of expropriation it had chosen a remedy inconsistent with a right to performance. The relief sought was a disproportionate interference with the sovereignty of Ecuador. Moreover, Perenco could not show that the threat to its rights was caused by Ecuador, which was entitled to look to Perenco as legal representative of the Consortium for payment of the debt owed by the Consortium and was not concerned in the relationship between Perenco and Burlington.\n\n37.\n\nBy a letter to the Tribunal dated 11 March 2009, Ecuador complained that the Tribunal's letter of 5 March (paragraph 35 above), \"changing\" its \"request\" of 24 February into a \"recommendation\", potentially exposed Ecuador *ex post facto* to the threat of punitive consequences for any violation of that request in the intervening period and was a serious violation of Ecuador's right to procedural fairness. The Tribunal had no power to make a recommendation without first deciding that application on the merits, which the Tribunal had not done. Ecuador reserved all its rights.\n\n38.\n\nA full hearing of Perenco's application for provisional measures took place in Paris on 19 March, when the parties' counsel helpfully explained and elaborated the contentions advanced in the pleadings. At the conclusion of the hearing the President made clear that the request made on 24 February and the recommendation notified on 5 March were to be treated as in force unless or until they were expressly revoked.\n\n**Jurisdiction**\n----------------\n\n39.\n\nWhile the Tribunal need not satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction to determine the merits of this case for the purposes of ruling on the application for provisional measures, it will not order such measures unless there is at least a *prima facie* basis upon which such jurisdiction might be established: *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v Chile* (ICSID Case No ARB/98/2), Decision on the request for provisional measures, 25 September 2001, paragraphs 1-12. It is not enough for the Tribunal that the Secretary-General has found that the dispute is not manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre and has therefore registered the Request for Arbitration under Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 6(1)(b) of the Institution Rules. The Tribunal must be satisfied there is a *prima facie* basis for jurisdiction. Under the terms of Article 9 of the Investment Treaty (see paragraph 17 above), Ecuador consented \"to submit any legal dispute arising between this Contracting Party and a national or a company of the other Contracting Party relating to an investment, to [ICSID], for conciliation or arbitral settlement in application of the [ICSID] Convention.\" In Article 1 \"investment\" was defined to include \"assets, rights and interests of all kinds\" and \"companies\" was defined to refer to \"any legal entity which is controlled by the nationals of one of the Contracting Parties\". It is said that Perenco is and has at all material times been controlled by French nationals.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter dated 17 October 2007 Perenco expressly accepted and granted its consent for Ecuador's offer to submit any dispute related to Law 42 or any other measure that might affect Perenco's investments in Ecuador to ICSID for resolution by arbitration. For purposes of Rule 2(3) of the Institution Rules, 17 October 2007 was the date on which, it appears, the parties agreed to submit the dispute to ICSID. Petroecuador appears to have given its consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID in clause 20.3 of the Block 7 Participation Contract and clauses 20.2.19 and 2.20.20 (*sic*) of the Block 21 Participation Contract. The Participation Contracts were executed on 23 March 2000 and 20 March 1995 respectively, and Perenco became a party to them by an agreement notarised on 4 September 2002. The date of consent as between Perenco and Petroecuador was accordingly, for purposes of Rule 2(3) of the Institution Rules, 4 September 2002.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion, at this stage, that Perenco has shown a *prima facie* basis upon which jurisdiction may be established, and this has not been contested.\n\n**Provisional Measures**\n------------------------\n\n42.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\nThis language largely reproduces that of Article 41 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice and has been interpreted in a similar sense. Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (2006) provides, in material part:\n\n\"(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n\u2026\n\n(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests\".\n\n(This last paragraph corresponds to numeral (5) in the 1985 ICSID Arbitration Rules).\n\n43.\n\nArticle 47 and Rule 39 recognise that the rights which a party asserts and seeks to preserve and protect in an arbitral proceeding may be effectively destroyed or seriously prejudiced by the action of the other party taken before a Tribunal is able to reach a final decision on the merits of the dispute between them. Thus power is conferred on the Tribunal to restrain such action in order to preserve the effectiveness and integrity of the proceeding and avoid severe aggravation of the dispute. But the Article and the Rule also recognise that a Tribunal must be slow to grant to a party, before a full examination of the merits of the case, a remedy to which, on such examination, the party may be found to be not entitled. The Tribunal must be even slower where, as here, the jurisdiction of the tribunal to entertain the dispute has not been established. So the test laid down by the Article for the grant of provisional measures is a stringent one: \"if [the Tribunal] considers that the circumstances so require\". The question is one for the judgment of the Tribunal: \"if it considers\". If the Tribunal does not consider that the circumstances require the grant of provisional measures, it may not grant them. If it considers that circumstances do so require it may grant provisional measures and is ordinarily likely to do so. But it will not judge that circumstances require the grant of provisional measures unless it judges such measures to be necessary and urgent. They must be necessary, because that is what \"require\" means, and measures will be not necessary where a party can be adequately compensated by an award of damages if it successfully vindicates its rights when the case is finally decided. Thus, as the Respondents correctly submit, many of the authorities express the test in terms of \"irreparable loss\". Where action by one party may cause loss to the other which may not be capable of being made good by an eventual award of damages, the test in the Article is likely to be met. But the Article does not lay down a test of irreparable loss and the authorities do not warrant so narrow a construction (see paragraphs 55-58 below). Provisional measures may only be granted where they are urgent, because they cannot be necessary if, for the time being, there is no demonstrable need for them. Provisional measures will be granted if necessary, at the time of the decision, to preserve the effectiveness and integrity of the proceedings and avoid severe aggravation of the dispute.\n\n**The Tribunal's Conclusions**\n------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nPerenco initiated this arbitration to protect its right to participate in oil exploration and production in Blocks 7 and 21 pursuant to the respective Participation Contracts for the financial reward specified in those contracts, irrespective of the price of oil in Ecuador or the world at any given time. Its complaint is that the enhanced payments demanded pursuant to Law 42 substantially reduce the financial reward to which, under the Participation Contracts, it is entitled, and it contends that Law 42 cannot validly supersede a contract binding on Ecuador in international law. The dispute at the heart of this arbitration concerns Perenco's rights under the Participation Contracts, as a matter of Ecuadorian Law and under the BIT, and the effect (if any) on those rights of Law 42.\n\n45.\n\nPerenco's claim is not one which can, in the Tribunal's opinion, be peremptorily rejected. It was because, in a changed oil market, the Participation Contracts were felt to yield an inadequate and unfair return to Ecuador that Law 42 was enacted and the decrees made pursuant to it. The object was to re-allocate the proceeds of oil production in Blocks 7 and 21 to the advantage of Ecuador and the corresponding disadvantage of Perenco. Modification of the Participation Contracts was the means chosen to achieve this object.\n\n46.\n\nOn the material currently before the Tribunal, it seems clear that, as matters now stand, and in the absence of provisional measures, Perenco faces the imminent seizure of its assets in Ecuador (whether oil, plant, equipment or bank balances) to the extent of US$327 million, plus interest and costs, unless it pays that sum within a very few days. It appears from a letter sent by Perenco's counsel to the Tribunal on 29 April 2009 (to which Ecuador has had no more than a brief opportunity of responding) that further steps may already have been taken. If Perenco's business in Ecuador were effectively brought to an end in this way, such injury could not, in the Tribunal's judgment, be adequately compensated by an award of damages should its claim be ultimately upheld. The Tribunal notes that Perenco amended its original Request for Arbitration to claim, as one of six heads of relief, orders that the Respondents reinstate fully Perenco's rights under the Participation Contracts according to their terms, and do not further derogate from those Contracts by, among other things, unilaterally amending, rescinding, terminating or repudiating the Contracts or any terms thereof. Thus Perenco specified restitution as a form of relief requested. In the Tribunal's judgment, the seizure of Perenco's assets, as described above, would seriously aggravate the dispute between the parties and jeopardise the ability of Perenco to explore for and produce oil in Blocks 7 and 21 pursuant to the Participation Contracts.\n\n47.\n\nIn a well-researched and well-argued submission the Respondents have advanced substantial reasons why the Tribunal should not consider that the present circumstances require the grant of provisional measures.\n\n48.\n\nFirst it is said that, by pleading that its interests have been \"expropriated\" (as in para 36 of the Request for Arbitration), Perenco has chosen a remedy inconsistent with a claim to protect its rights under the Participation Contracts. Paragraph 36 was drafted with express reference to Article 6 of the Treaty, of which a breach was alleged. But Perenco's case is and has always been that the Participation Contracts remain in force according to their letter; that it has continued to perform them according to their letter; and that it wishes to continue to do so. The Respondents for their part do not contend that the Contracts have been terminated, and have confirmed (paragraph 27 above) that neither of them has commenced proceedings towards termination of the contracts. Had the contracts been terminated, it may be (this Tribunal need express no opinion) that the principle articulated by the Tribunal in the Decision on Provisional Measures in *Occidental v Ecuador*, would be applicable. The relevant contracts in that case had been terminated, and the Tribunal ruled (paragraph 79):\n\n\"It is well established that where a State has, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, put an end to a contract or license, or any other foreign investor's entitlement, specific performance must be deemed legally impossible\".\n\nIt went on to rule (paragraph 86):\n\n\"In conclusion, it is the Tribunal's view that the Claimants have not established a strongly arguable case that there exists a right to specific performance where a natural resources concession agreement has been terminated or cancelled by a sovereign State\".\n\nIrrespective of whether the *Occidental* Tribunal was correct in this view, on which this Tribunal takes no position, on the materials currently before this Tribunal, there having been no such termination or cancellation, the principle invoked by the *Occidental* Tribunal is inapplicable.\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondents contend, secondly, that as an independent sovereign State Ecuador has the right to control its own natural resources, that Law 42 was lawfully enacted under the law of Ecuador, that Law 42 has been held to be constitutional by the highest legal authority in the State, and that any interference with the operation of Law 42 by the Tribunal would impermissibly infringe the sovereignty of Ecuador. The Tribunal would here repeat and adopt what was said by the Tribunal in the *City Oriente v Ecuador*, Decision on provisional measures, 19 November 2007, paragraph 43, where the effect of Law 42 was also in contention:\n\n\"... The Tribunal is very much aware that the Law was passed by the Legislative Branch of the State of Ecuador in exercise of its legitimate and undisputed national sovereignty and that, subsequently, the Constitutional Tribunal of that country, by Resolution of 22 August 2006, ruled that it does not violate the Constitution. It is for the Ecuadorian public authorities to enact the laws they deem appropriate for that nation's common good, and the Tribunal neither can nor wishes to interfere in such legislative task. The Tribunal's function in this case is limited to resolving any disputes arising in connection with the Contract\" (Tribunal's translation).\n\nThe same Tribunal, in its Decision on revocation of provisional measures (13 May 2008), paragraphs 56-57, repeated this passage and added:\n\n\"The Arbitral Tribunal ratifies this conclusion. An arbitrator lacks any jurisdiction to suspend Ecuador's legislative powers or legislative acts emanating from the Ecuadorian Congress, and the Tribunal has never intended and much less ordered so. As clearly stated in paragraph 43 of its Decision [footnote omitted], '[t]he Tribunal's function in this case is limited to resolving the disputes arising in connection with the Contract'. And this is what has happened: what the Arbitral Tribunal has suspended through the Provisional Measures are not Ecuador's legislative acts, but rather any compulsory or coercive measure or act by Petroecuador or Ecuador resulting in interference with contractual rights including Claimant's right to demand performance of the Contract\" (Tribunal's translation).\n\nThe Tribunal granted, and declined to revoke the grant of, provisional measures. In paragraph 90 of its revocation decision the Tribunal explained:\n\n\"First, the Tribunal reiterates once more its respect for the sovereign powers of the Republic of Ecuador and the right to dispose of its natural resources pursuant to any laws that the Ecuadorian public authorities deem appropriate. The Provisional Measures do not interfere with the exercise of those powers. They only establish that, on a provisional basis, while the impact of an enacted law is resolved, natural resources continue to be exploited pursuant to a Contract granted at the time by Ecuadorian public authorities, considering it then a valid and effective instrument to regulate its natural resources. If Respondents consider that City Oriente owes them certain amounts, this arbitration is the perfect forum to make such claim\" (Tribunal's translation).\n\n50.\n\nIt is pertinent to recall that in any ICSID arbitration one of the parties will be a sovereign State, and where provisional measures are granted against it the effect is necessarily to restrict the freedom of the State to act as it would wish. Interim measures may thus restrain a State from enforcing a law pending final resolution of the dispute on the merits, as in *City Oriente* and *Sergei Paushok v Mongolia*, Order of interim measures (UNCITRAL, 2 September 2008), or from enforcing or seeking a local judgment, as in *Electricity Company of Sofia & Bulgaria (Belgium v Bulgaria)*, 1939 P.C.I.J. (ser A/B) No 79, 5 December 1939, and *Ceskoslovensko Obchodni Banka AS v The Republic of Slovakia* (ICSID Case No ARB/97/4), Procedural Order No 4, January 11, 1999. While the enactment of a law by a sovereign State, upheld as constitutional in that State, is a matter of importance, it cannot be conclusive or preclude the Tribunal from exercise of its power to grant provisional measures. In *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v Chile* (ICSID Case No ARB/98/2), Decision on the request for provisional measures, 25 September, 2001, the Tribunal observed, in paragraph 52:\n\n\"It is not necessary to stress again the principles and practice relating to the links between internal and international law, or the rule according to which a State should not invoke its domestic law to excuse or justify the breach of one of its international obligations\" (English translation in 6 ICSID Reports, page 388, provided by the Claimant).\n\nThe effect (if any) of Law 42 on Perenco's rights under the Participation Contracts, as a matter of Ecuadorian Law and under the BIT, is the issue at the heart of this arbitration. At this provisional stage, the Tribunal cannot approach the issue on the assumption that either party's contention is correct. Its role, analogous to that of the *City Oriente* Tribunal, is to dispose of disputes arising between the parties in connection with the Participation Contracts.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondents' third and main answer to Perenco's application for provisional measures hinges on their contention that Perenco can resolve its current problems by simply making the enhanced payments required by Law 42 and withheld since April 2008. On this ground it is denied that such measures are necessary, since if Perenco is ultimately successful it will recover sums overpaid with interest and will suffer no irreparable loss. Since that solution is available to Perenco, the grant of relief is not urgent. Its alleged predicament is of its own making, and not caused by any action of the Respondents. The Respondents point out that in a letter of 19 May 2006 Perenco described the Law 42 payments as \"mandatory\" until the Law was declared to be unconstitutional; it had made the enhanced payments, under protest, until the end of April 2008; thereafter it and Burlington had, at least for a time, deposited the sums due under Law 42 into separate, segregated bank accounts. Perenco could resolve its difficulties by paying the full sum of US$327 million due, which it was well able to do.\n\n52.\n\nPerenco challenged the assertion that it was well able to pay this sum, which was due (if at all) from the Consortium and not it alone. It had no power or authority to advance payment on behalf of Burlington. This, the Respondents replied, was an internal matter between Perenco and Burlington and was no concern of theirs. Under the novated joint operating agreements pertaining to the two Blocks, Perenco was the sole operator and legal representative of the Consortium (the formation of which was required by the law of Ecuador), and was legally liable to perform the obligations of the Consortium.\n\n53.\n\nIt may very well be (the Tribunal is in no position to decide) that under the law of Ecuador the State is entitled to look to Perenco to satisfy the debts of the Consortium. But this, even if accepted, in the view of the Tribunal, begs a much more fundamental question. That question is whether, an arbitration having been initiated to determine whether Perenco's rights under the Participation Contracts have been modified or superseded by the requirement in Law 42 that it make enhanced payments to Ecuador, not provided for in those contracts, circumstances should be considered by the Tribunal to require the grant of provisional measures to restrain Ecuador from taking imminent coercive action to enforce the making of such payments. The Respondents accept that such measures would include the seizure of oil produced by Perenco in satisfaction of the sums allegedly due from the Consortium over such period as might be necessary to enable Ecuador to recoup its loss, a period which might extend to 18 months, during which Perenco would be likely to operate at a loss. Other assets could also be seized. It is realistic, in the Tribunal's judgment, to apprehend that Perenco's business in Ecuador would be crippled, if not destroyed.\n\n54.\n\nIn the judgment of the Tribunal, the grant of provisional measures in such circumstances is fully sanctioned by a long line of authority, laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice, the International Court of Justice, ICSID Tribunals and at least one UNCITRAL Tribunal.\n\n55.\n\nIn its judgment of 5 December 1939 in the *Electricity Company of Sofia* case cited above, the Permanent Court of International Justice referred to\n\n\"the principle universally accepted by international tribunals and likewise laid down in many conventions to which Bulgaria has been a party to the effect that the parties to a case must abstain from any measure capable of exercising a prejudicial effect in regard to the execution of the decision to be given and, in general, not allow any step of any kind to be taken, which might aggravate or extend the dispute\".\n\nThis principle was invoked by the International Court of Justice in the *LaGrand* case (*Germany v United States of America* (2001 ICJ 466, 27 June 2001)) at paragraph 103, when it added that\n\n\"... measures designed to avoid aggravating or extending disputes have frequently been indicated by the Court\".\n\nThe principle was also invoked by an ICSID Tribunal in the *Pey Casado* case cited above (25 September 2001), paragraph 69. In that case the Tribunal also cited, at paragraphs 70-72, the *Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Case*, and *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v Uganda)*. In the first of these cases, at page 93, the parties were restrained from taking any action which might prejudice the rights of the other party in respect of the carrying out of any decision on the merits which the Court might subsequently render and from taking any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute submitted to the Court. In the second case, the ICJ recalled, at paragraph 44, that its statute gave it \"the power to indicate provisional measures with a view to preventing the aggravation or extension of the dispute whenever it considers that circumstances so require\". Listing the standards to be met before provisional measures would be granted, an UNCITRAL Tribunal in *Paushok v Government of Mongolia*, cited above, at paragraph 45, included \"imminent danger of serious prejudice (necessity)\".\n\n56.\n\nIn *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine* (ICSID Case No ARB/02/18), in its Order No 1 (1 July 2003), an ICSID Tribunal referred to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, discussed below, and continued in paragraph 2:\n\n\"According to this basic principle, ICSID tribunals have repeatedly ruled:\n\n(a) that the parties to a dispute over which ICSID has jurisdiction must refrain from any measure capable of having a prejudicial effect on the rendering or implementation of an eventual ICSID award or decision, and in general refrain from any action of any kind which might aggravate or extend the dispute or render its resolution more difficult...\"\n\nIn the same case, in Order No 3 (18 January 2005), paragraph 7, a differently-constituted Tribunal observed:\n\n\"A provisional measure may also be granted to protect a party from actions of the other party that threaten to aggravate the dispute or prejudice the rendering or implementation of an eventual decision or award\".\n\nIn *Saipem S.p.A v The People's Republic of Bangladesh* (ICSID Case No ARB/05/07), 21 March 2007, paragraph 175, an ICSID Tribunal held, after citing earlier authority, that under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention \"a tribunal enjoys broad discretion when ruling on provisional measures, but should not recommend provisional measures lightly and should weigh the parties' divergent interests in the light of all the circumstances of the case\". One of the members of the Tribunal in that case was Professor Christoph Schreuer, whose respected *Commentary* on the ICSID Convention (Cambridge University Press, 2001), in paragraph 15 (page 751), described several situations in which the conditions of necessity and urgency required for the grant of provisional measures might be present. These included: the necessity to take early measures to secure compliance with an eventual award; the necessity \"to stop the parties from resorting to self-help or seeking relief through other remedies\"; and the necessity \"to prevent a general aggravation of the situation through international action\".\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal has paid close attention to the decisions of the ICSID Tribunal in *City Oriente v Ecuador*, cited above, in which the facts, although not identical with those here, were similar. At the heart of both cases lies a dispute concerning the recoverability of enhanced payments said to be required by Law 42. In its first decision on provisional measures (19 November 2007), the Tribunal said at paragraphs 55-59:\n\n\"55. Both Article 47 of the Convention and Rule 39(1) of the Arbitration Rules, require that the provisional measures be necessary to preserve the rights of the requesting party, without providing further explanations. However, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Convention stated that the purpose of the provisional measures should be to preserve the *status quo* as between the parties pending a final decision by the Tribunal. That is to say, in the Tribunal's opinion, what Article 47 of the Convention authorizes is the issuance of provisional measures prohibiting any action that affects the disputed rights, aggravates the dispute, frustrates the effectiveness of a future award or involving a party taking justice into its own hands. Whenever an agreement exists between the parties that has so far defined the framework of their mutual obligations, then the rights to be preserved are, precisely, those that were thereby agreed upon.\n\n56. City Oriente is requesting this Arbitral Tribunal to issue provisional measures, by virtue of which the *status quo* existing prior to the enactment of the new Law No 2006-42 is maintained, and which it describes as a situation of compliance with the rights and obligations arising from the Contract, pursuant to the terms thereof.\n\n57. In the opinion of this Arbitral Tribunal, the provisional measures requested by Claimant are necessary to safeguard Claimant's rights and the claims it has asserted in this arbitration. Indeed, City Oriente is seeking an order to have the Contract performed pursuant to its original terms and conditions. Ecuador and Petroecuador understand that the rights and obligations arising from the Contract have not been affected or modified as a result of the application of Law No 2006-42, which is to be enforced on its own terms. Respondents may or may not be right - an issue pertaining to the merits on which the Tribunal cannot and should not rule at this time. However, while the matter is being resolved, the principle that neither party may aggravate or extend the dispute or take justice into their own hands prevails. Consequently, Ecuador and Petroecuador shall continue to comply with the obligations that they voluntarily undertook in the Contract, pursuant to the agreed upon terms, and they must refrain from declaring its termination or otherwise modifying its content.\n\n58. Claimant has identified four acts by Ecuador and Petroecuador which, in its opinion, violate the *status quo* and need to be suspended.\n\nThe demand for payment\n\n59. The first act is to order the payment of over USD 28 million, made by Petroecuador through the issuance of the invoice dated October 19, 2007, to which reference has been made above. In the Arbitral Tribunal's opinion, Respondents are required to refrain from demanding such payment or any other amount accrued not from the application of what was agreed upon in the Contract but, rather, of Law No 2006-42. Respondents, of course, may file a counterclaim and, should they succeed, the Tribunal will render an award ordering City Oriente to make payment of all such amounts, which award may be enforced by execution of any of City Oriente's rights and assets in Ecuador. However, in the meantime, the *status quo* must be maintained and the principles that the dispute is not to be aggravated and of *pacta sunt servanda* must prevail\"  \n (Tribunal's translation)\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion (paragraph 69), provisional measures were urgent, \"precisely to keep the enforced collection or termination proceedings from being started, as this operates as a pressuring mechanism, aggravates and extends the dispute and, by itself, impairs the rights which Claimant seeks to protect through this arbitration\".\n\n58.\n\nIn its second decision, on revocation of provisional measures (13 May 2008), the *City**Oriente* Tribunal reiterated the same rulings. It held (paragraph 58):\n\n\"City Oriente has a right to have the *status quo ante* maintained while the arbitration proceedings are pending, to continue to have the Contract fulfilled pursuant to the same terms agreed upon by the parties. and to have Petroecuador and Ecuador refrain from adopting any unilateral measures of a coercive or compulsory nature compromising the balance\".\n\nIt pointed out (paragraph 62) that without the provisional measures the Respondents might coercively collect amounts that were not required under the Contract, or even declare the expiration of the Contract: it repeated (paragraph 71) that enforced collection would operate as a pressuring mechanism, aggravate and extend the dispute, and, by itself, impair the rights which City Oriente sought to protect through the arbitration. The object of the provisional measures (paragraph 93) was that, pending a decision on the merits, the Respondents (in an English translation of the Spanish original supplied to the Tribunal reference was erroneously made to \"Claimants\" when the word used in Spanish was \"Respondents\", \"las Demandadas\") should not aggravate the dispute or unilaterally modify the *status quo ante*, which was the one resulting from the terms freely agreed by the parties.\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondents criticised some aspects of the reasoning of the *City Oriente* Tribunal, but this Tribunal considers the decision to be legally sound and consistent with authority. It also considers it to be apt on the facts of the present case.\n\n60.\n\nIn paragraph 53 above the Tribunal has framed what is described as \"a much more fundamental question\". The question must be answered in the affirmative. Having initiated this arbitration to challenge the recoverability of enhanced payments not provided for in the Participation Contracts but demanded pursuant to Law 42, Perenco should not, pending a final decision, be required to choose between making the very payments they dispute and suffering extensive seizure of its oil production or other assets.\n\n61.\n\nAs a variant on what is described above (paragraph 51) as their third and main argument, the Respondents contend that Perenco could resolve its current difficulties by making the required deposit and challenging the *coactiva* notices in the Ecuadorian courts. Perenco's reasons for rejecting this course are, in large part, those already rehearsed. But it contends, in addition, that resort to the Ecuadorian courts by the Respondents or itself is inconsistent with Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. This provides:\n\n\"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy *...\"*\n\nThe object of this provision is not in doubt. It is to ensure that an ICSID Tribunal, duly constituted, has exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute of which it is seized. As the Tribunal observed in the second *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* decision cited above, in paragraph 7,\n\n\"Among the rights that may be protected by provisional measures is the right guaranteed by Article 26 to have the ICSID arbitration be the exclusive remedy for the dispute to the exclusion of any other remedy, whether domestic or international, judicial or administrative\".\n\nThe claims which the Respondents are invoking the legal process of the domestic courts to enforce are the claims which Perenco has brought this arbitration to challenge. It is, in the Tribunal's opinion, inescapable that the Respondents' resort to that process violates Article 26. It is also, in the Tribunal's opinion, inescapable that Perenco would violate the Article if it were, in the domestic courts of Ecuador, to advance the arguments which it will rely on in this arbitration to challenge the recoverability of payments demanded under Law 42. Unless and until the Tribunal rules that it has no jurisdiction to entertain this dispute, if its jurisdiction is hereafter challenged, or the Tribunal delivers a final award on the merits, none of the parties may resort to the domestic courts of Ecuador to enforce or resist any claim or right which forms part of the subject matter of this arbitration.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that circumstances require it to recommend, and it does recommend, provisional measures restraining the Respondents from:\n\n(1) demanding that Perenco pay any amounts allegedly due pursuant to Law 42;\n\n(2) instituting or further pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, including the actions described in the notices dated 19 February and 3 March 2009, to collect from Perenco any payments Respondents claim are owed by Perenco or the Consortium pursuant to Law 42;\n\n(3) instituting or pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, against Perenco or any of its officers or employees, arising from or in connection with the Participation Contracts; and\n\n(4) unilaterally amending, rescinding, terminating, or repudiating the Participation Contracts or engaging in any other conduct which may directly or indirectly affect or alter the legal situation under the Participation Contracts, as agreed upon by the parties.\n\nAs from the date of this Decision, the Tribunal's communications of 24 February and 5 March (paragraphs 28 and 35 above) shall cease to have effect.\n\n63.\n\nSince the Tribunal may, in a later decision, hold that it has no jurisdiction to entertain this dispute, or that the Respondents are entitled to claim and enforce the enhanced payments required by Law 42, the Tribunal considers that the Respondents should enjoy a measure of security in relation to sums accruing due to them from Perenco (not the Consortium) under Law 42 from the date of this Decision forward until such later decision. It considers that such security is best provided by payment of the sums so accruing into an escrow account, from which sums will be disbursed on the direction of the Tribunal or by agreement of the parties. The Tribunal invites the parties to agree the terms and conditions on which such account may be established, and to establish it, within 120 days of the date of issuance of this Decision. If, at the end of that period, the parties fail to agree or act, either party may revert to the Tribunal.\n\n**The Tribunal's communications of 24 February and 5 March 2009**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nAs recorded above in paragraph 37, the Respondents have challenged the propriety of the Tribunal's \"request\" of 24 February 2009 and its indication on 5 March that such \"request\" had the same legal quality as a \"recommendation\". The Respondents are understood to raise three objections of principle:\n\n(1) that the Tribunal had no power to make a request or recommendation without giving the Respondents an opportunity of presenting their observations, which it had not done;\n\n(2) that the Tribunal had no power to make a \"request\", as it had purported to do on 24 February, since its power under Article 47 and Rule 39 was only to make a \"recommendation\";\n\n(3) that it was procedurally unfair to the Respondents for the Tribunal to \"change\" the quality of its \"request\", retrospectively, to that of a \"recommendation\".\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it should address these objections at this stage. It wishes to preface its discussion of the objections with four points. First, it is observed that the power to recommend provisional measures under Article 47 of the Convention is not qualified by a requirement to first hear from both parties. It is a broad power vested in the Tribunal and is itself deserving of protection. In the Tribunal's view, once putatively vested with jurisdiction to hear a claim (subject to resolving any objections thereto definitively), an ICSID tribunal has the duty to protect its jurisdiction to resolve the dispute that has been put before it. Second, if, having been served with an application for interim measures, a party could act in the period intervening between the application's filing and the filing of its response to upset the *status quo* which the application sought to maintain, and to justify its action on the ground that Rule 39 disempowered the Tribunal from acting under Article 47 until it heard from both parties, a disputing party would have the power to prevent the Tribunal from exercising fully its jurisdiction under the Convention. It cannot be right that a Tribunal's jurisdiction to grant interim measures is subject to a disputing party's changing its relationship *vis-\u00e1-vis* the other disputing party during the briefing schedule. The Tribunal would reject such argument as being at variance with the broad power vested in it by Article 47. Third, the Tribunal notes that notwithstanding the vigour with which the Respondents have advanced their objection to the Tribunal's \"request\", their own communication dated 20 February 2009, implicitly acknowledged that the Tribunal has the power to act before hearing both parties on all issues relevant to the application: in Ecuador's letter, which asserted that the Tribunal could not issue a \"request\" and proposed that the Respondents be granted approximately six weeks to file their observations on provisional measures, with reply and rejoinder to follow and a hearing to be held some two months hence, the Respondent undertook \"to serve notice on the Tribunal granting enough time for the Tribunal to act as necessary, before it takes any measure to enforce the debts.\" Correctly, in the Tribunal's view, no attempt was made to argue that, once given notice of a measure to enforce the debts said to be owing, the Tribunal could act only if it heard from both parties. Finally, the context within which the Tribunal issued its request must be borne in mind. The speed with which the Respondents appeared to be moving to change the *status quo* while the briefing schedule was being decided, in the Tribunal's view, demanded a response.\n\n65.\n\nTurning to the three stated objections, the Tribunal cannot accept the validity of the first objection. Even if it be accepted that the Tribunal's power under Rule 39(3) to recommend provisional measures on its own initiative is subject to the provision in Rule 39(4) that it may only recommend such measures \"after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations\", the procedural history in this case shows that the Respondents expressly objected to the Tribunal's power to issue the \"request\" that thereafter issued. The Respondents thus had an opportunity of presenting their observations as to the existence of the power which was exercised and did so in their letter of 20 February 2009 summarised in paragraph 25 above. In the same letter the Respondents also gave reasons for contending that such relief was not urgent or necessary. They proposed a timetable deferring a decision on provisional measures for upwards of two months which, on the facts, the Tribunal considered much too long a delay. It accordingly made its request, but it did so after receiving submissions in writing from both parties to the dispute. It is satisfied that the requirements of Rule 39(4) were met.\n\n66.\n\nAs to the Respondents' second objection, the Tribunal observes that Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(3) and (4) of the Rules must be interpreted in their contexts and in the light of their objects and purposes, all as required by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Irrespective of the precise terminology used, the Tribunal's efforts to effectuate its mandate under a treaty by prevailing on the parties to maintain the *status quo* in the case before it are binding on the parties pursuant to their obligations under said treaty. Case law from other ICSID tribunals, the International Court of Justice, and the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, all of which can be of assistance to ICSID arbitral panels (see, *e.g.,* J. A. Rueda-Garcia, \"Provisional Measures in Investment Arbitration: Recent Experiences in Oil Arbitrations Against the Republic of Ecuador\", *Transnational-Dispute-Management.com*, at 25 March 2009) also supports the conclusion that Respondents' attempt to distinguish meaningfully between the Tribunal's use of the word \"request\" and the word \"recommendation\" found in Article 47 is unduly narrow.\n\n67.\n\nIn becoming a Party to a treaty such as the ICSID Convention (plus, as in this case, a bilateral treaty for the promotion and protection of investment binding the State Parties to ICSID arbitration), a State confers upon an arbitral tribunal jurisdiction over certain claims and assumes an obligation to take whatever steps might be necessary to comply with decisions rendered by the tribunal pursuant to the treaty. So long as and to the extent that the arbitration is in progress, both parties are under an international obligation to comply with whatever the tribunal issues as provisional measures for the purpose of protecting its jurisdiction and its ability, should it so decide, to grant the relief requested. State Parties to the ICSID Convention thus inherently are under an international obligation to comply with provisional measures issued by an ICSID tribunal.\n\n68.\n\nThis view of provisional measures is not new. It was first articulated over 60 years ago by Judge Manley O. Hudson of the Permanent Court of International Arbitration, who, in discussing the drafting process of the Statute for the Permanent Court of International Justice, noted that the change from \"suggest\" to \"indicate\" in Article 41 of that Court's Statute \"may have been due to a certain timidity of the draftsmen, and that it is no less definite than the term 'order' would have been, and it would seem to have as much effect\": see Manley O. Hudson, \"The Permanent Court of International Justice: A Treatise\" 415 (1943) quoted in T. Elias, *The International Court of Justice and Some Contemporary Problems* 78-79 (1983). Furthermore, noted Hudson, the use of the word \"indicate\" did not lessen the obligation of a party to carry out measures \"which ought to be taken\", pointing out that \"an indication by the Court under Article 41 is equivalent to a declaration of an obligation contained in a judgment, and it ought to be regarded as carrying the same force and effect\": *ibid*.\n\n69.\n\nIf the binding character of the word \"indicate\" in Article 41 of the ICJ's Statute empowering it to impose binding provisional measures on parties was ever in doubt, the ICJ explicitly eliminated any lingering thoughts to the contrary in the *LaGrand* case, cited above:\n\n\"102. It follows from the object and purpose of the Statute, as well as from the terms of Article 41 when read in their context, that the power to indicate provisional measures entails that such measures should be binding, inasmuch as the power in question is based on the necessity, when the circumstances call for it, to safeguard, and to avoid prejudice to, the rights of the parties as determined by the final judgment of the Court. The contention that provisional measures indicated under Article 41 might not be binding would be contrary to the object and purpose of that Article.\n\n103. A related reason which points to the binding character of orders made under Article 41 and to which the Court attaches importance is the existence of a principle which has already been recognized by the Permanent Court of International Justice when it spoke of 'the principle universally accepted by international tribunals and likewise laid down in many conventions. to the effect that the parties to a case must abstain from any measure capable of exercising a prejudicial effect in regard to the execution of the decision to be given, and, in general, not allow any step of any kind to be taken which might aggravate or extend the dispute'. Furthermore measures designed to avoid aggravating or extending disputes have frequently been indicated by the Court. They were indicated with the purpose of being implemented [citations omitted]\".\n\nElsewhere the Court states (paragraph 110) that its prior indication of provisional measures in an Order of 3 March 1999 \"was not a mere exhortation\", but rather had been adopted pursuant to Article 41 of its Statute and was \"consequently binding in character and created a legal obligation for the United States\". The Court held that, by failing to take all measures at its disposal to ensure that Walter LaGrand was not executed pending the final decision of the ICJ, the United States had breached the obligation incumbent upon it under the Order indicating provisional measures issued by the Court on 3 March 1999. The parallels between \"recommend\" in the ICSID Convention and \"indicate\" in the ICJ Statute are quite clear, suggesting that one cannot rightly assume that a \"request\" is comparatively weaker than a \"recommendation\", or that neither is binding.\n\n70.\n\nShortly after the decision in *LaGrand*, the European Court of Human Rights addressed the issue of interim measures under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: see *Mamatkulov and Askarov v Turkey* [GC], Nos 46827/99 and 46951/99, ECHR 2005-1 (Judgment of 4 February 2005). In concluding that Turkey, by not complying with interim measures \"indicated\" to it, had breached the Convention, the Court noted that in *LaGrand* the \"ICJ brought to an end the debate over the strictly linguistic interpretation of the words 'power to indicate' in the first paragraph of Article 41 and 'suggested' in the second paragraph by concluding, with reference to the Vienna Convention, that provisional measures were legally binding\": see para 117. The ECHR adopted the ICJ's conclusions and reinforced them with the views of several other international courts and adjudicative bodies, drawing attention to the near-universal agreement on the importance of interim measures in ensuring the \"effective exercise\" of the right of individual petition. The Court stated,\n\n\"123.... in the light of the general principles of international law, the law of treaties and international case-law, the interpretation of the scope of interim measures cannot be dissociated from the proceedings to which they relate or the decision on the merits they seek to protect. The Court reiterates in that connection that Article 31 \u00a7 1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that treaties must be interpreted in good faith in the light of their object and purpose, and also in accordance with the principle of effectiveness.\n\n124. The Court observes that the International Court of Justice, the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights, the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture of the United Nations, although operating under different treaty provisions to those of the Court, have confirmed in their reasoning in recent decisions that the preservation of the asserted rights of the parties in the face of the risk of irreparable damage represents an essential objective of interim measures in international law. Indeed it can be said that, whatever the legal system in question, the proper administration of justice requires that no irreparable action be taken while proceedings are pending [citations omitted]\"\n\nIt is clear from the above that provisional measures have a significant role in the administration of public international law.\n\n71.\n\nThe Iran-United States Claims Tribunal has consistently issued \"requests\" imposing provisional measures that it regards as binding. That Tribunal operates for provisional measures purposes under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which provides:\n\n\"1) At the request of either party, the arbitral tribunal may take any interim measures it deems necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute, including measures for the conservation of the goods forming the subject-matter in dispute, such as ordering their deposit with a third person or the sale of perishable goods.\n\n2) Such interim measures may be established in the form of an interim award. The arbitral tribunal shall be entitled to require security for the costs of such measures.\n\n3) A request for interim measures addressed by any party to a judicial authority shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate, or as a waiver of that agreement.\"\n\n72.\n\nFrom the *E-Systems* case onward, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal has used the word \"request\" when issuing provisional measures: *E-Systems v The Islamic Republic of Iran and Bank Melli Iran*, Award No ITM 13-338-FT (Feb. 4, 1983) reprinted in 2 *Iran-U.S. C.T.R.* 51. See also David D. Caron \"Interim Measures of Protection: Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal\", 46 *Zeitschrift f\u00fcr auslandisches-offentliches Recht und Volkerrecht* 466, 509-510 (1986) (observing that the mandatory nature of a \"request\" in the Tribunal's award was clear from the reasoning of the awards and became even clearer as a result of the way the Tribunal dealt with potential or actual non-compliance with the Tribunal's \"requests\"). In that case, the Tribunal phrased its request as follows: \"The Tribunal requests the Government of Iran to move for a stay of the proceedings before the Public Court of Tehran until the proceedings in this case before the Tribunal have been completed\": see note at p. 59. Since that early case the word \"request\" has been used by the Tribunal uniformly in exercising its power under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules to \"take. interim measures\", including cases in which it has acted entirely on its own initiative to restrain parties on a temporary basis pending its hearing a contested application for provisional measures.\n\n73.\n\nWith respect to the \"request\" *versus* \"recommend\" distinction, the Tribunal notes in particular the Concurring Opinion of Judges H. Holtzmann and R. Mosk in *E-Systems* (at pp 57, 64) which states that\n\n\"One might have preferred to express the obligatory nature, of the Interim Award by use of the word 'orders' instead of 'requests'. It must be recalled, however, that this is addressed to one of the Governments which established the Tribunal by international agreement. It is to be presumed that such Government will respect the obligation expressed in the Interim Award stating what it 'should' do. Accordingly, we join with those who consider the term 'requests' is adequate in this context. In these circumstances we consider that a 'request' is tantamount to and has the same effect as an order.\"\n\nThe Tribunal followed this decision with several others, all upholding the use of \"requests\" in its power to indicate binding provisional measures on the parties: see generally the cases collected at Charles N. Brower & Jason D. Brueschke, *The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal*, 223-226 (Martinus Nijhoff, The Hague, 1998).\n\n74.\n\nIt is now generally accepted that provisional measures are tantamount to orders, and are binding on the party to which they are directed: see Zannis Mavrogordato and Gabriel Sidere, \"The Nature and Enforceability of ICSID Provisional Measures\", 75 *Arbitration* 38, (2009), 41-42. The first ICSID tribunal so to hold was in *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No ARB/06/21), Decision on Request for Provisional Measures, 28 October, 1999, at para 9, where the Tribunal explained that\n\n\"While there is a semantic difference between the word 'recommend' as used in Rule 39 and the word 'order' as used elsewhere in the Rules to describe the Tribunal's ability to require a party to take a certain action, the difference is more apparent than real. The Tribunal does not believe the parties to the Convention meant to create a substantial difference in the effect of these two words. The Tribunal's authority to rule on provisional measures is no less binding than that of a final award. Accordingly, for the purposes of this Order, the Tribunal deems the word 'recommend' to be of equivalent value as the word 'order'\".\n\nSeveral other tribunals have followed the reasoning in *Maffezini*, which derives its force from that tribunal's belief in what the Contracting States party to the Convention intended: see, for example, *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v Ukraine*, cited above, para 4; *Occidental Petroleum Corp. and other v Ecuador*, cited above, para 58; *City Oriente Ltd v Ecuador*, cited above, Decision on Provisional Measures, para 52.\n\n75.\n\nIn *Victor Pey Casado v Chile*, cited above, para 22, the tribunal took another approach, one that made explicit the relevance of ICJ and Iran-United States Claims Tribunal jurisprudence on this point. The ICJ had at that time recently clarified in the *LaGrand* case that its power to \"indicate\" provisional measures under Article 41 of the ICJ Statute is binding on the parties. Most recently, the tribunal in *Roussalis v Romania* emphatically endorsed the view that provisional measures are \"substantively binding\": ICSID Case No ARB/06/01, para 21.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept that a request, formally expressed, may properly be regarded as of less binding force than a recommendation. While different languages use different expressions, to recommend in ordinary English usage is to give advice which the addressee is ordinarily free to follow or not. The use of this deferential expression when addressing a sovereign State is understandable and well-understood. But a request is more positive, still deferential, but seeking a definite outcome. The language used by the Tribunal in its letter of 24 February (\"The Tribunal believes it is necessary nonetheless, to request the parties to refrain from initiating or continuing any action or adopting any measure which may, directly or indirectly, modify the *status quo* between the parties.\") could not reasonably be understood as extending an invitation devoid of legal consequences. The Tribunal cannot, accordingly, uphold the Respondents' second objection.\n\n77.\n\nSince the Tribunal does not accept that its communication of 5 March 2009 retrospectively converted what had been an invitation of a non-binding nature into a recommendation having legal force, the Tribunal cannot accept that the Respondents have suffered any procedural unfairness or that their third objection is valid. The object which its letter of 24 February sought to achieve was, or should have been, clear. On 27 February the Tribunal indicated that it would have to take a serious view of any failure to comply with its request. It was open to the Respondents, if in doubt about the effect of the Tribunal's request, to seek clarification from the Tribunal, which would have been readily forthcoming.\n\n**Decision on Provisional Measures**\n------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal repeats for convenience its rulings set out in paragraphs 62 and 63 above:\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that circumstances require it to recommend, and it does recommend, provisional measures restraining the Respondents from:\n\n(1) demanding that Perenco pay any amounts allegedly due pursuant to Law 42;\n\n(2) instituting or further pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, including the actions described in the notices dated 19 February and 3 March 2009, to collect from Perenco any payments Respondents claim are owed by Perenco or the Consortium pursuant to Law 42;\n\n(3) instituting or pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, against Perenco or any of its officers or employees, arising from or in connection with the Participation Contracts; and\n\n(4) unilaterally amending, rescinding, terminating, or repudiating the Participation Contracts or engaging in any other conduct which may directly or indirectly affect or alter the legal situation under the Participation Contracts, as agreed upon by the parties.\n\nAs from the date of this Decision, the Tribunal's communications of 24 February and 5 March (paragraphs 28 and 35 above) shall cease to have effect.\n\n80.\n\nSince the Tribunal may, in a later decision, hold that it has no jurisdiction to entertain this dispute, or that the Respondents are entitled to claim and enforce the enhanced payments required by Law 42, the Tribunal considers that the Respondents should enjoy a measure of security in relation to sums accruing due to them from Perenco (not the Consortium) under Law 42 from the date of this decision forward until such later decision. It considers that such security is best provided by payment of the sums so accruing into an escrow account, from which sums will be disbursed on the direction of the Tribunal or by agreement of the parties. The Tribunal invites the parties to agree the terms and conditions on which such account may be established, and to establish it, within 120 days of the date of issuance of this Decision. If, at the end of that period, the parties fail to agree or act, either party may revert to the Tribunal."}, {"Title": "Decision on Challenge of Charles N. Brower", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2009-12-08T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Challenge of Charles N. Brower\n------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis challenge procedure arises out of a pending International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") arbitration between a French company, Perenco Ecuador Limited (\"**Perenco**\" or \"**Claimant**\") and the Republic of Ecuador (\"**Ecuador**\") and its state-owned oil company, Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador (\"**Petroecuador**,\" together with Ecuador, \"**Respondents**.\")\n\n2.\n\nClaimant and Respondents (the \"**Parties**\") had, in October 2008, agreed that any arbitrator challenges in this case would be resolved by the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"**PCA**\"), applying the International Bar Association Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration (\"**IBA Guidelines**\").\n\n3.\n\nIn August 2009, Respondents became aware of a published interview given by the Hon. Charles N. Brower (\"**Judge Brower**\"), the arbitrator appointed by Claimant, in which he made comments about Ecuador and about the pending ICSID proceedings. Those comments gave rise to Respondents' request, on 19 September 2009, that Judge Brower be disqualified.\n\n4.\n\nThe relevant question in resolving this challenge under the IBA Guidelines is whether the interview comments constitute circumstances that, \"from a reasonable third person's point of view having knowledge of the relevant facts, give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence.\"\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe below summary is based on the factual background and procedural history as described by the Parties and Judge Brower to the PCA in this challenge proceeding.\n\n**A. The ICSID Arbitration**\n----------------------------\n\n6.\n\nIn September 2002, Perenco and its consortium partner, Burlington Resources Oriente Limited (\"**Burlington**\"), entered into participation contracts with Respondents to operate certain oil fields in Ecuador's Amazon region (\"**Participation Contracts**\"). Under the Participation Contracts, the consortium carries out oil exploration and production activities in return for which it is entitled to a specified share in the production, known as \"participation.\" Under the Participation Contracts, Perenco is entitled to approximately 77% of the production, and Ecuador to about 23%.\n\n7.\n\nAmid rising oil prices in 2006, the Ecuadorean Congress passed Law No. 2006-42 (\"**Law 42**\"), which significantly increased the percentage of Ecuador's participation and entitlement to the income from oil sales. Perenco considered Law 42 to be a violation of the 1994 Treaty between France and Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (\"**Treaty**\"). On April 30, 2008, pursuant to the Treaty, Perenco filed a request for arbitration with ICSID, alleging, among other things, that Ecuador's measures had the effect of expropriating Perenco's investment. Burlington started a similar arbitration under the US-Ecuador BIT.\n\n8.\n\nOn July 18, 2008, Claimant nominated Judge Brower as arbitrator.\n\n9.\n\nThrough a series of three letters, dated September 19, September 30 and October 2, 2008, the Parties entered into an agreement about constitution of the Tribunal (the \"**October 2008 Agreement**\"), which provided, at paragraph 3, as follows:\n\nEach party shall have the right to challenge an arbitrator within a sixty-day period from the date on which such party learned of the alleged cause for the challenge, regardless of whether such date is before or after the execution of the agreement. The right to request a challenge expires after the sixty-day period. In case such challenge occurs, the parties agree that it shall be resolved by the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague and that the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration shall apply.\n\n10.\n\nPursuant to the October 2008 Agreement, Respondents appointed Dr. J. Christopher Thomas QC as arbitrator. On November 5, 2008, ICSID informed the Parties that, in accordance with the method agreed by the Parties, the Rt. Hon. Lord Bingham of Cornhill had been appointed as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n11.\n\nAt the time of accepting his appointment in October 2008, Judge Brower submitted a declaration under ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2). A series of follow-up emails ensued in February and March of 2009, in which Judge Brower acknowledged Ecuador's desire to be \"reassured as to the independence and impartiality of any arbitrator appointed in this case\" and agreed with Ecuador's sentiment that transparency and impartiality concerns are particularly significant in investor-State proceedings. On March 26, 2009, Ecuador acknowledged that the information provided by Judge Brower was \"in accordance with the IBA Guidelines [and] has allowed the Republic of Ecuador to be fully satisfied that this matter will be decided by an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal.\"\n\n12.\n\nPerenco ceased making payments under Law 42 when it commenced the arbitration.\n\n13.\n\nOn February 14, 2009, Ecuador's President announced that Ecuador would take coercive measures against Perenco and Burlington because they had failed to make payments under Law 42. The President announced that the country would \"not pay attention to extra-regional authorities that attempt to tell us what to do nor not to do.\"\n\n14.\n\nOn February 18, 2009, Respondents advised the Tribunal that it would initiate a *coactiva* process against Perenco and Burlington to demand approximately US$327 million allegedly owing under Law 42. The *coactiva* notices, issued the next day, warned that failure to pay would result in Perenco's assets being seized.\n\n15.\n\nOn February 19, 2009, Perenco submitted a request for provisional measures, requesting the Tribunal to enjoin Respondents from forcibly collecting any of the Law 42 assessments and to otherwise preserve the *status quo* between the Parties. Perenco also sought a temporary restraining order.\n\n16.\n\nOn February 24, the Tribunal issued a temporary restraint finding it \"necessary to request the parties to refrain from initiating or continuing any action... including any attempt to seize any assets of claimant, until it has had an opportunity to further hear from the parties.\"\n\n17.\n\nOn February 26, 2009, Ecuador's counsel informed the Tribunal that it was unable to comply with the Tribunal's \"request\" and gave notice that, \"charged with the obligation of applying its validly enacted laws,\" it could not guarantee that steps would not be taken to forcibly collect the Law 42 debts. The Tribunal stated the following day that it \"regrets the stance adopted by respondent and must necessarily take a serious view of any failure to comply with its request of February 24, 2009.\"\n\n18.\n\nOn March 3, 2009, Respondents seized Perenco's crude production and instructed that Perenco's oil be retained in custody. The Tribunal, on March 5, 2009, wrote that it \"wishes to make it clear that its February 24, 2009 *request* had and continues to have the same authority as a *recommendation,* as envisaged in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention....\" Respondents reserved their rights in respect of this communication and stated that the Tribunal could not \"retrospectively recharacterize its request as a recommendation under Article 47.\" Respondents went ahead with the *coactiva* actions and seized Perenco's oil.\n\n19.\n\nOn March 19, 2009, the Tribunal conducted a hearing on the provisional measures application.\n\n20.\n\nOn May 8, 2009, the Tribunal issued a decision recommending provisional measures restraining Respondents from demanding Perenco pay any amounts owed under Law 42, from pursuing actions to collect payments from Perenco or from unilaterally amending the Participation Contracts. The Tribunal explained that its recommendation imposed an international obligation on Ecuador to comply with the provisional measures. The tribunal in the Burlington case issued similar provisional measures.\n\n21.\n\nIn a letter dated May 15, 2009, Ecuador maintained its view that the Tribunal's recommendation of provisional measures was not \"binding\" as a matter of international law but noted that \"Ecuador intends to carry out the enforcement of Law 42 in such a way as to avoid any disruption of Perenco's business.\"\n\n22.\n\nEcuador's reaction to the provisional measures was widely publicized. On May 15, 2009, Petroecuador held the first of several auctions of the crude oil it had seized from Claimant.\n\n23.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction in the ICSID arbitration is scheduled for February 2010.\n\n24.\n\nIn the meantime, Perenco has suspended operations and Respondents are now in control of the oil fields. On May 30, 2009, the President of Ecuador announced that Ecuador would denounce the ICSID Convention, which it formally did on July 6, 2009.\n\n**B. The Challenge to Judge Brower**\n------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nIn an article entitled \"A World-Class Arbitrator Speaks!\" in the August 2009 issue of *The Metropolitan Corporate Counsel*, Judge Brower was interviewed about a wide variety of topics including his current docket of appointments, his opinion on arbitral rules, recent developments in international arbitration, the current status of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal and issues surrounding enforcement of arbitral awards.\n\n26.\n\nIn an early part of the interview, which is *not* the subject of the present challenge, the Editor remarked to Judge Brower that \"Ecuador has recently announced that it's denouncing its BITs.\" Judge Brower responded to this observation as follows:\n\n**Brower:** It has already given notice to ICSID that it is denouncing that Convention, so during the six months from the date notice was given, they may expect a last minute rush of new claims. Either it or Venezuela has denounced its bilateral investment treaty with The Netherlands. Ecuador has spoken of the possibility of denouncing its BIT with the United States, but as far as I know that hasn't been done. Bolivia is the other country that has denounced ICSID, but that doesn't solve its problem, since bilateral investment treaties usually provide for the alternative of the UNCITRAL Rules, so they'd have to go around denouncing all of their bilateral investment treaties, and I think that's a much different and bigger step.\n\n27.\n\nThe following exchange appears two questions later and it *does* contain the comments that gave rise to Respondents' challenge of Judge Brower:\n\n**Editor: Tell us what you see as the most pressing issues in international arbitration.**\n\n**Brower:** There is an issue of acceptance and the willingness to continue participating in it, as exemplified by what Bolivia has done and what Ecuador is doing. Ecuador currently is expressly declining to comply with the orders of two ICSID tribunals with very stiff interim provisional measures, but they just say they have to enforce their national law and the orders don't make any difference. But when recalcitrant host countries find out that claimants are going to act like those who were expropriated in Libya, start bringing hot oil litigation and chasing cargos, doing detective work looking for people who will invoke cross-default clauses in loan agreements, etc., the politics may change. After a certain point, no one will invest without having something to rely on.\n\n28.\n\nRespondents became aware of the interview on August 20, 2009 from the electronic Translational Dispute Management News Digest.\n\n29.\n\nOn September 19, 2009, Respondents timely submitted a Request for Disqualification of Judge Brower by the PCA Secretary-General, pursuant to the Parties' October 2008 Agreement.\n\n30.\n\nIn a letter dated September 21, 2009, Claimant expressed its view that the challenge was meritless and sought expeditious resolution of the challenge by the PCA Secretary-General.\n\n31.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, following a series of communications among ICSID, the PCA, members of the Tribunal and the Parties, the PCA communicated that I accepted the responsibility conferred on me by the Parties' October 2008 Agreement, and invited the Parties to propose a timetable for submissions of comments in relation to the Request for Disqualification.\n\n32.\n\nOn October 16, 2009, the Parties jointly wrote to the PCA Secretary-General setting out their proposed timetable for further submissions.\n\n33.\n\nOn October 19, 2009, Claimant submitted its Response to Respondents' Request for Disqualification.\n\n34.\n\nOn October 23, 2009, Judge Brower submitted his Statement in Respect of Respondents' Request for Disqualification.\n\n35.\n\nOn October 30, 2009, Respondents submitted their Reply in Support of their Request for Disqualification.\n\n36.\n\nOn November 6, 2009, Claimant submitted its Rejoinder to Respondents' Request for Disqualification.\n\n37.\n\nThe above-listed submissions were accompanied by legal authorities, exhibits from the ICSID proceedings and documents in the public domain, including media reports.\n\n**III. THE STANDARD UNDER THE IBA GUIDELINES**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe IBA Guidelines, published by the International Bar Association in 2004, were developed by a Working Group of experts and based on an understanding of the best current international practice firmly rooted in the principles expressed in the General Standards.\n\n39.\n\nThe first General Standard, entitled \"General Principle,\" provides as follows:\n\nEvery arbitrator shall be impartial and independent of the parties at the time of accepting an appointment to serve and shall remain so during the entire arbitration proceeding until the final award has been rendered or the proceeding has otherwise finally terminated.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n40.\n\nAccording to the Explanation to General Standard 1, the Working Group was \"guided by the fundamental principle in international arbitration that each arbitrator must be impartial and independent of the parties at the time he or she accepts an appointment to act as arbitrator and must remain so during the entire course of the arbitration proceedings.\"\n\n41.\n\nThe second General Standard, entitled \"Conflict of Interest\" provides as follows:\n\n(a) An arbitrator shall decline to accept an appointment or, if the arbitration has already been commenced, refuse to continue to act as an arbitrator if he or she has any doubts as to his or her ability to be impartial or independent\n\n(b) The same principle applies if facts or circumstances exist, or have arisen since the appointment, that, from a reasonable third person's point of view having knowledge of the relevant facts, give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence, unless the parties have accepted the arbitrator in accordance with the requirements set out in General Standard (4).\n\n(c) Doubts are justifiable if a reasonable person and informed third party would reach the conclusion that there was a likelihood that the arbitrator may be influenced by factors other than the merits of the case as presented by the parties in reaching his or her decision.\n\n[...]\n\n[emphasis added]\n\n42.\n\nParagraph (b) is concerned with \"justifiable doubts\" from a \"reasonable third person\" perspective. The Explanation to General Standard 2 describes this as \"an appearance test\" to be applied \"objectively.\"\n\n43.\n\nA 2004 paper written by members of the Working Group entitled \"Background Information on the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration\" (\"**Background Information**\") explains that the Guidelines start from \"the widely accepted premise that an arbitrator must be independent and impartial, that is, without bias.\" In all of the jurisdictions considered by the Working Group in formulating the Guidelines, there was agreement \"that a challenge to the impartiality and independence of an arbitrator depends on the *appearance* of bias and not actual bias.\" The Background Information proceeds to explain that:\n\nBased on the virtual consensus of the national reports and the discussions of national law, the Working Group decided that the proper standard for a challenge is an \"objective\" appearance of bias, so that an arbitrator shall decline appointment or refuse to continue to act as an arbitrator if facts or circumstances exist that form a reasonable third person's point of view having knowledge of the relevant facts give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence. If an arbitrator chooses to accept or continue with an appointment once such bias has been brought to light, disqualification is appropriate and a challenge to the appointment should succeed.\n\n44.\n\nAccordingly, a finding that Judge Brower is *actually biased* against Ecuador or has actually prejudged the merits of the dispute is not necessary in order for the challenge to be sustained under the IBA Guidelines. Applying the *appearance of bias* test, Judge Brower would be disqualified if \"circumstances... have arisen since the appointment, that, from a reasonable third person's point of view having knowledge of the relevant facts, give rise to justifiable doubts\" as to Judge Brower's impartiality or independence.\n\n45.\n\nThe IBA Guidelines note that \"most laws and rules that apply the standard of justifiable doubts do not further define that standard.\" The Working Group regards paragraph (c) of General Standard 2 as \"provid[ing] some context for making this determination\" by explaining that \"doubts are justifiable if a reasonable and informed third party would reach the conclusion that there was a likelihood that the arbitrator may be influenced by factors other than the merits of the case as presented by the parties in reaching his or her decision.\"\n\n**IV. APPLICATION OF THE IBA GUIDELINES TO THE PRESENT CHALLENGE**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe question to be resolved is whether, from a reasonable third person's point of view having knowledge of the relevant facts, Judge Brower's comments give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence. Stated in another way, could a reasonable and informed third party conclude that there is a likelihood that Judge Brower may be influenced by factors other than the merits of the case as presented by the parties in reaching his decision?\n\n47.\n\nThis question is answered with respect to each of the Parties' arguments below.\n\n**A. The appearance of bias**\n-----------------------------\n\n48.\n\nRespondent argues that Judge Brower's interview gives rise to a strong appearance of bias. Claimant argues that the interview contained an innocuous summary of publicly known facts. It is true that a fully informed third party would know that Ecuador has in fact denounced the ICSID Convention and has in fact taken actions in the Perenco dispute that do not comply with the provisional measures recommended by the ICSID Tribunal. However, the combination of the words chosen by Judge Brower and the context in which he used them have the overall effect of painting an unfavourable view of Ecuador in such a way as to give a reasonable and informed third party justifiable doubts as to Judge Brower's impartiality.\n\n49.\n\nIt is reasonable to interpret the sentence beginning \"But when recalcitrant host countries...\" as a reference to Ecuador. Even though, as Judge Brower points out, the sentence itself does not contain the word \"Ecuador\" or any names of the parties to the ICSID arbitration, its proximity immediately following two sentences about Ecuador, and in the same answer to the same interview question, makes it reasonable to associate the term \"recalcitrant\" with Ecuador. Respondents argue that the word \"recalcitrant\" is pejorative in nature. Claimant argues that because the word \"recalcitrant\" is an accurate description of Ecuador's obstinate disobedience, it cannot give rise to justifiable doubts. Judge Brower notably does not discuss the import of the word \"recalcitrant.\" The dictionary source on which he relies for the definition of another word (www.dictionary.com), defines \"recalcitrant\" as \"1. resisting authority or control; not obedient or compliant; refractory; 2. hard to deal with, manage or operate\" and \"marked by stubborn resistance to and defiance of authority or guidance.\" The use of the word \"recalcitrant\" has negative connotations beyond the mere recounting of a party's actions and would contribute to a reasonable person forming a justifiable doubt, particularly when taken in combination with the following factors.\n\n50.\n\nA reasonable third party would read the juxtaposition of the sentences about Ecuador with the comments about Libya as likening Ecuador's current conduct with that of Libya in the 1970s. Unless the Libya reference is tied to the current Ecuador conduct, Judge Brower's remarks about notorious events in the 1970s would make no sense as part of an answer to the question \"what do you see as the most pressing issues in international arbitration?\"\n\n51.\n\nAn informed third person could reasonably conclude that Judge Brower's comments about Libya in the 1970s, uttered in such close connection to his comments about Ecuador, evince the appearance of two unfavourable views of Ecuador. First, that investors today in Ecuador are similar to investors in Libya in the 1970s in the sense that they have been subject to expropriation. Second, that investors in Ecuador today are similar to investors in Libya in the 1970s in the sense that they may need to resort to various measures of enforcing awards against the expropriating state because the State cannot be trusted to abide by an arbitral award.\n\n52.\n\nMoreover, the comments were given in response to a question about what Judge Brower believes to be \"the most pressing issue\" in international arbitration. In this context, a reasonable third party may consider that Judge Brower views the behavior of Ecuador as of such gravity as to warrant its characterization as one of the most pressing issues in international arbitration.\n\n53.\n\nThe above interpretation is of course not the *only* interpretation of Judge Brower's comments and it is not *in fact* what Judge Brower subjectively intended by his comments, as he explained in his Statement. But it is a reasonable interpretation of Judge Brower's comments and, applying the IBA Guidelines, would give rise to justifiable doubts about his impartiality.\n\n**B. The risk of prejudgment**\n------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nRespondents argue that Judge Brower's comments show justifiable doubts that he has prejudged the case in two respects. First, Respondents argue he has prejudged the \"live issue\" of whether provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are legally binding. Second, Respondents argue he has prejudged the ultimate issue to be determined on the merits of the case, namely whether Ecuador is liable for having expropriated Perenco's investment.\n\n55.\n\nAs to alleged prejudgment of the issue of the binding nature of the Tribunal's provisional measures recommendations, Respondents' argument fails because it has not shown that this issue is a \"live one.\" Rather than *prejudging* the question, Judge Brower was merely repeating what the Tribunal has *already judged*. On May 8, 2009, months before Judge Brower's interview, the Tribunal issued its decision on provisional measures in which it made clear its view that provisional measures were tantamount to orders and that \"Ecuador has an international obligation to comply with what the tribunal issues as provisional measures.\"\n\n56.\n\nThere is, however, merit in Respondents' argument that Judge Brower's comments suggest that he has prejudged the question of whether Ecuador's actions constitute an expropriation. By invoking the example of \"those who were expropriated in Libya\" immediately after a reference to Ecuador's attitude to investment arbitration generally, and its conduct in this ICSID case in particular, it is reasonable to infer that Judge Brower is drawing an analogy between Ecuador and Libya in the famous nationalizations of oil companies in the 1970s. While Judge Brower explains his belief that the sentences are unrelated and the Libya example is given as a general hypothesis only, a reasonable reader would nevertheless view the sentences, in response to the same question, as related.\n\n57.\n\nClaimant admits that Judge Brower's Libya comments provide \"a trenchant and illuminating historical analogy\" between Libya and the Perenco dispute with Ecuador. Claimant argues that the analogy is not with respect to *liability* for expropriation but an analogy with respect to possible *investor reaction*. This is an unconvincing distinction because any such analogy to investor reaction would only make sense if the hypothetical investors were reacting to a State's refusal to honour an award for expropriation. The mention of different types of enforcement actions (hot oil litigation, chasing cargoes, detective work, invoking loan agreements, etc.) in the context of the remarks about Ecuador would lead a reasonable third party observer to have justifiable doubts about Judge Brower's prejudgment on the question of expropriation and also Ecuador's likely conduct in relation to Claimant's future attempts to enforce any award for expropriation.\n\n58.\n\nAgain, the above does not amount to a finding that Judge Brower has *actually* prejudged the issue of expropriation. However, from a reasonable third person's point of view, the comments do give rise to an *appearance* that Judge Brower has prejudged the issue.\n\n**C. The mere fact of Judge Brower \"going public\"**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nRespondents argue that the very fact that Judge Brower \"decided to go public\" with his comments in a published interview, against the background of the escalating dispute between Perenco and Ecuador, demonstrates a lack of impartiality. Respondents cite authorities concerning the standards of American judges in support of this argument.\n\n60.\n\nThe Background Information to the IBA Guidelines notes that the Working Group determined that the Guidelines \"should reflect best international practice without reference to particular national practices.\"\n\n61.\n\nThere is no general or absolute prohibition in the IBA Guidelines against international arbitrators speaking with the press or making public statements about pending cases. The IBA Guidelines instead focus on an inquiry into justifiable doubts brought about by *particular* \"facts or circumstances\" in any given challenge. Obviously, if an arbitrator chooses to discuss a pending case with the press, he or she risks opening up the possibility of making statements that could give rise to justifiable doubts about his or her impartiality. But there is no basis in the IBA Guidelines on which to accept Respondent's argument that Judge Brower's decision to give the interview *in and of itself* should lead to his disqualification.\n\n**D. The experience and reputation of Judge Brower**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nClaimant argues that Judge Brower's \"experience and standing are relevant when evaluating his independence and impartiality.\" The justifiable doubts test is objective and applies universally to all arbitrators, irrespective of whether they are chairs, sole arbitrators or party-appointed arbitrators (see General Standard 5). There is nothing in the IBA Guidelines that supports a special deference to the subjective positions of arbitrators based on their level of experience or standing in the international community. Judge Brower no doubt has extensive experience in international arbitration and is highly regarded in the field, but this fact is irrelevant in applying the IBA.\n\n63.\n\nIndeed, given Judge Brower's experience and reputation, it can be assumed that he must have been aware of the risks his interview could entail as far as raising justifiable doubts regarding his impartiality or independence.\n\n**E. The stage of the proceedings**\n-----------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Parties agree that the IBA Guidelines express clearly the requirement that an arbitrator must remain impartial and independent \"during the entire course of the arbitration proceedings.\" Respondents nevertheless intimate that because the arbitration is at a very early stage of proceedings, disqualification would cause minimal disruption.\n\n65.\n\nAs Judge Brower points out, the stage of proceedings (which are neither at a very early, or a very late stage) is \"wholly irrelevant\" to this challenge.\n\n66.\n\nApplying the IBA Guidelines, I have not taken the stage of proceedings into account in determining this challenge.\n\n**F. Breach of confidentiality**\n--------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nRespondents raise breach of confidentiality as a separate ground for disqualifying Judge Brower. Although the findings set out above are sufficient to dispose of the challenge, I briefly address the confidentiality argument given the seriousness of the allegations.\n\n68.\n\nThe IBA Guidelines do not provide for breach of confidentiality as a ground for disqualification of an arbitrator. In any event, having reviewed the documents provided by both Parties and Judge Brower, it is clear that Judge Brower did not say anything in the interview that revealed confidential information from the arbitration. Ecuador's withdrawal from the ICSID Convention is public knowledge. The fact of Perenco's dispute with Ecuador is public knowledge. The provisional measures decisions by the tribunals in the Perenco and Burlington ICSID arbitrations are publicly available on the ICSID website and have been the subject of media attention. The Parties' public statements and conduct in reaction to the decisions have also been widely covered by the international media and oil industry press.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n**NOW THEREFORE,** I, Christiaan M.J. Kroner, Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, having considered the comments submitted by the Parties and by Judge Brower, and having established to my satisfaction my competence to decide this challenge applying the IBA Guidelines in accordance with the October 2008 Agreement between the Parties,\n\n**HEREBY SUSTAIN** the challenge against the Hon. Charles N. Brower as arbitrator in the above-referenced matter for the reason that, from the point of view of a reasonable third person having knowledge of the relevant facts, the comments made by Judge Brower in an interview published in the August 2009 edition of *The Metropolitan Corporate Counsel* constitute circumstances that give rise to justifiable doubts as to Judge Brower\u2019s impartiality or independence."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2011-06-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** | |\n| BIT or the Treaty | Bilateral Investment Treaty; Treaty between the Republic of France and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment |\n| RA | Request of Arbitration filed by Perenco on 30 April 2008 |\n| CM | Claimant [Perenco]'s Memorial of 10 April 2009 |\n| CCM | Claimant [Perenco]'s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction of 17 September 2009 |\n| CR | Claimant [Perenco]'s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction of 15 January 2010 |\n| Exh.

FACTS RELEVANT TO JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 30 April 2008, Perenco Ecuador Limited (\"Perenco\") filed a request for arbitration with ICSID against the Republic of Ecuador (\"Ecuador\") and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (\"Petroecuador\"; together, \"the Respondents\"). The dispute between the parties arises out of a series of measures adopted by the Respondents which, according to Perenco, are in breach of Ecuador's obligations under the Agreement on the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments concluded between France and Ecuador on 7 September 1994 (hereinafter, \"the Treaty\" or \"the BIT\") and affects its rights under two Participation Contracts. One of these is a Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 7 of the Amazon Region, including the Contract for the Coca-Payamino Unified Field (\"the Block 7 Participation Contract\" or \"the Block 7 Contract\"), and the other is a Participation Contract for Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon River (\"the Block 21 Participation Contract\" or \"the Block 21 Contract\"), (together, the two contracts will be referred as \"the Participation Contracts\" or \"the Contracts\").\n\n2.\n\nPerenco's request for arbitration was brought to ICSID on the basis of Article 9 of the BIT, as well as on the basis of the arbitration clauses contained in the Contracts.\n\n**2. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n*The Claimant*\n--------------\n\n3.\n\nPerenco Ecuador Limited (\"Perenco\") is a company duly incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The Parties do not appear to contest that Perenco was the wholly-owned subsidiary of Perenco Gabon S.A., a company incorporated in the Bahamas, at the time Perenco commenced these proceedings before ICSID. In turn, 92.5% of the shares of Perenco Gabon S.A. were held by Perenco S.A., another company incorporated in the Bahamas. One-hundred percent of the shares of Perenco S.A. were held by another Bahamas registered company, Perenco International Limited, and 92.9% of the shares of Perenco International Limited were held by the estate of the late Hubert Perrodo, a French national.\n\n4.\n\nMr. Perrodo died intestate in 2006, and as such, the devolution of his estate is governed by French law. His estate remains in suspension, and has not been divided among Mr. Perrodo's four heirs. Perenco asserts that each of these purported heirs is a French national. For their part, the Respondents contest the assertion that the shares of Perenco International Limited (Perenco's ultimate parent corporation) belong to the purported heirs of Mr. Perrodo.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant is represented by Mr. Mark W. Friedman, Ms. Sarah H. Wolf, Mr. Thomas H. Norgaard and Ms. Mary Grace McEvoy of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP; and by Mr. Ga\u00ebtan Verhoosel and Ms. Carmen Mart\u00ednez L\u00f3pez of Covington & Burling LLP.\n\n*The Respondents*\n-----------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondents are the Republic of Ecuador (\"Ecuador\") and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (\"Petroecuador\").\n\n7.\n\nThe national state oil company of Ecuador, Petroecuador, was created pursuant to the Ley Especial de Petroecuador y sus Empresas Filiales (\"Law 45\") on 26 September 1989. Pursuant to Article 1 of Law 45, Petroecuador was created \"with legal personality, its own assets, administrative, economic, financial and operative autonomy, with its main domicile in the city of Quito.\"1 Petroecuador is the successor to the Corporaci\u00f3n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana (\"CEPE\"), which was formed in 1972 and was dissolved in 1989. Article 22 of Law 45 establishing Petroecuador provides that \"[a]ll rights, obligations, legal situations and facts of [CEPE] generated by its Establishing Law... or resulting from any other legitimate source of obligation, are transferred to Petroecuador as of the effective date of this Law.\"\n\nExh. C-20.\n\n8.\n\nCEPE was designated by Ecuador to ICSID as an agency of Ecuador pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. CEPE was designated by means of a written notice to the Secretary General of ICSID on 19 April 1988. All Parties agree that Ecuador has not submitted a formal designation letter to ICSID for Petroecuador as it did for CEPE.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondents are represented by Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, Ecuador's Procurador General; Dr. \u00c1lvaro Galindo Cardona, Dr. Francisco Grijalva Mu\u00f1oz, and Dr. Francisco Paredes, of the Procuradur\u00eda del Estado; Contralmirante Luis Aurelio Jaramillo Arias, Executive President of Petroecuador; and Mr. Pierre Mayer, Mr. Eduardo Silva Romero, Mr. Daniel Gal, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Caicedo, of Dechert LLP.\n\n**3. The Block 7 and Block 21 Participation Contracts**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nIn Ecuador, the Hydrocarbons Law (\"HCL\") provides the legal framework by which private entities may contract with the Government to explore for and extract crude oil in Ecuador. Prior to 1993, oil contractors would operate predominantly through service contracts, by which the contractor would perform exploration and exploitation services in a designated area and would receive from Ecuador reimbursement of its costs and an additional fixed fee. In 1993, Law 44 was enacted to amend the Hydrocarbons Law, making it possible for oil contractors to operate in Ecuador through participation contracts. Under a participation contract, the private contractor assumes all the risks and costs of the exploration and exploitation of oil reserves in the area designated by the contract and, in exchange, has the right to receive a share of the revenue of the oil produced.\n\n11.\n\nFollowing the enactment of Law 44 and its implementing regulations, Ecuador launched bidding rounds based on the new participation contract model. Foreign investors were invited to participate in these new bidding rounds. According to Respondents, the Hydrocarbons Law required that the Comit\u00e9 Especial de Licitaciones (Special Bidding Committee, \"CEL\") manage the contract bidding process and award each of the contracts. CEL is chaired by the Minister of Energy and Mines and includes representatives of other Ministries as members. According to Respondents, CEL also appoints officials from Petroecuador and other public servants to negotiate the terms of the contracts with the oil contractors.\n\n12.\n\nDuring its Seventh Bidding Round, Ecuador awarded a participation contract for Block 21 to a group of foreign investors, including an entity called Oryx Ecuador Energy Company (\"Oryx\"). The Block 21 Contract was executed on 20 March 1995. According to Perenco, Oryx led the contractors' side of negotiations. The parties to the Block 21 Contract are identified in its Clause 3.3.25 as \"the Ecuadorian State, through Petroecuador, and the Contractor.\" In addition, on 23 March 2000, Ecuador agreed to modify the service contract for the exploration and exploitation of Block 7 into a participation contract. As with the Block 21 Contract, the parties to the Block 7 Contract are identified in its Clause 3.3.22 as \"the Ecuadorian State, through Petroecuador, and the Contractor.\"\n\n13.\n\nPerenco was not part of the original group of foreign contractors to either the Block 7 or Block 21 Contracts at the time the contracts were executed. Perenco became a party to both contracts on 4 September 2002. At the same time, Perenco also entered into Joint Operating Agreements with the other entities holding interests in the Blocks. Perenco became the sole operator and majority shareholder of rights in both Blocks, holding a 53.7% interest in Block 21 and a 57.50% interest in Block 7. The remaining interest in both Blocks was held by Burlington Resources Oriente Limited (\"Burlington\"), with which Perenco has formed a Consortium.\n\n14.\n\nUnder the terms of the Block 7 and Block 21 Participation Contracts, the contractor was responsible for carrying out the exploration and exploitation activities in the assigned areas. Perenco has alleged, and it has not been contested, that pursuant to its duties under the Contracts, Perenco has made substantial investments in personnel, equipment, machinery, technology, infrastructure and goods and services. In exchange, the Contracts entitled the contractor to share in the oil production from the blocks. Clause 8.1 of the Contract granted the contractor the right to receive a share of the production, pursuant to a formula set forth in this provision. This formula provided that as the volume of production rose, the percentage share of Ecuador would increase to a specific extent and that of Perenco would decrease. The Contracts made no express reference to the sale price or value of the oil produced.\n\n**4. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n15.\n\nThis dispute arises out of Ecuador's enactment of legislative measures which increased its participation under the Participation Contracts on \"extraordinary revenues\" earned under the Contracts. Briefly summarized, it is Perenco's contention that it has certain enforceable contractual rights as a party to the Participation Contracts, and that in reliance on those rights it invested large sums in the exploration and extraction of oil in Ecuador. Perenco contends that Ecuador's enactment and enforcement of these legislative measures violated the terms of both the Participation Contracts and the Treaty. Perenco further alleges that the legislative measures also discriminated against foreign oil companies as they virtually did not affect any Ecuadorian companies.\n\n16.\n\nOn 19 April 2006, the Ecuadorian Congress enacted Law No. 2006-42 (\"Law 42\"), which amended the Hydrocarbons Law by adding the following language:\n\n\"Participation of the State in surplus prices from the sale of oil and gas not agreed upon or not foreseen.\n\nContractor companies that maintain participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in effect with the Ecuadorian state under this Law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil subject to participation that corresponds to them, when the effective monthly medium price of FOB sale of Ecuadorian oil petroleum goes above the monthly average prices in effect at the time of the execution of the contract, expressed in constant prices for the month of liquidation, will recognize in favour of the Ecuadorian state a participation of at least 50% of the extraordinary income generated by the difference in price. For the purposes of this Article, extraordinary revenues shall be understood to mean the difference in the above-described price, multiplied by the number of barrels produced.\n\nThe price of crude oil as of the date of the contract used as a reference for calculation of the difference shall be adjusted, considering the Consumer Price Index of the United States of America, published by the Central Bank of Ecuador.\"2\n\nExh. C-3.\n\n17.\n\nLaw 42 therefore imposed on contractors with Participation Contracts, like Perenco, the obligation to grant Ecuador a share of their \"extraordinary income,\" e.g., any revenues earned per barrel that exceeded the monthly average selling price of Ecuadorian oil at the time of the execution of the Contracts (the \"reference price\"). The Participation Contracts had made no reference to the monthly average FOB price of Ecuadorian oil at the time of the execution of the Contracts and did not allot Ecuador a participation of as much as 50% in the price or value of any of the oil produced.\n\n18.\n\nFollowing the enactment of Law 42, the Ministry of Energy and Mines (now the Ministry of NonRenewable Natural Resources) established the applicable reference prices, adjusted for inflation, that were said to be in effect at the time of the Contracts' execution. The assigned reference prices would be US$ 25 per barrel for the Block 7 Contract and US$ 15 per barrel for the Block 21 Contract. It is Perenco's contention that these designated prices were below market at the time of the Contracts' execution, and were \"dramatically below market\" in subsequent years as oil prices rose.3\n\nTr. Day 1, 106:20.\n\n19.\n\nOn 11 July 2006, the Government of Ecuador issued Decree No. 1672, implementing Law 42 and setting the percentage of the \"extraordinary income\" payable to Ecuador at 50%, payable on a monthly basis. On each barrel of oil sold at a price above the reference prices, therefore, Ecuador would receive the agreed contractual percentage of the price up to the reference price, and would receive 50% of the \"extraordinary income\" revenue exceeding the reference price.\n\n20.\n\nDecree No 1672 was subsequently amended on 4 October 2007 by Decree No. 662, which increased Ecuador's additional participation on unforeseen surpluses from 50% to 99%. This decree generated a strong outcry from foreign investors. In response, the President of Ecuador announced on 26 January 2008 that the contractors to Ecuador's oil participation contracts would henceforth have three possible options: 1) to renegotiate the original terms of the contracts, 2) to pay to the Ecuadorian Government the 99% of \"extraordinary income\" under the contracts, or 3) leave the country.\n\n21.\n\nUnder protest, Perenco paid Ecuador the extraordinary income revenue on Blocks 7 and 21 as required by Law 42. At the same time, the Parties attempted to negotiate a compromise solution. Compromise ultimately was not reached and the President of Ecuador terminated negotiations on 12 April 2008. On 30 April 2008, Perenco filed a request for arbitration with ICSID against Ecuador and Petroecuador, following a similar request made by Burlington to ICSID on 21 April 2008.\n\n22.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to render an award in its favour:\n\n(a) Declaring that Ecuador has breached its obligations under the Treaty and international law;\n\n(b) Declaring that Respondents have breached their obligations under the Participation Contracts;\n\n(c) Directing Respondents to indemnify Perenco for all direct and indirect damages as a result of their breaches, including payments made to date under the HCL Amendment, and costs and expenses of this proceeding, in amounts to be determined at the hearing; and\n\n(d) Directing Respondents to pay Perenco interest on all sums awarded, in amounts to be determined at the hearing, and to order any such further relief as may be available and appropriate in the circumstances.4\n\nRA \u00b6 42(a)-(d).\n\n23.\n\nThe Consortium subsequently proposed in a letter to the Ecuadorian Minister of Mines and Petroleum and to Petroecuador that it transfer the disputed Law 42 payments into an escrow account pending resolution of the dispute. This proposal was not accepted by Ecuador. The Consortium nonetheless began making payments due under Law 42 into such an escrow account, starting in June 2008.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 February 2009, the President of Ecuador announced that he had ordered \"coercive measures\" against Perenco and Burlington because they had \"not paid their taxes on extraordinary gains (due to the high price of crude).\" On 19 February 2009, Ecuador issued the first of three series of enforcement notices (known as \" *coactivas* \") to Perenco, as the operator of Blocks 7 and 21, to enforce payments in the total of US$ 327.3 million for both Contracts allegedly owed under Law 42. On 3 March 2009, the Court of Enforcement ordered seizure of the crude oil production from Perenco, until such time as the entire amount of the Consortium's debt had been settled.\n\n**5. The Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures and Subsequent Developments**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nOn 19 February 2009, the day that Ecuador issued the first of its *coactiva* notices to Perenco for the collection of Law 42 payments, Perenco submitted an Application for Provisional Measures. Perenco sought to enjoin Respondents from forcibly collecting any Law 42 payments pending resolution of the claim, stressing the urgency of its request since the Respondents would begin seizing Perenco's assets in a matter of days. In a letter to the Parties of 24 February 2009, the Tribunal requested the Parties \"to refrain from initiating or continuing any action or adopting any measure which may, directly or indirectly, modify the *status quo* between the parties *vis-\u00e0-vis* the participation contracts, including any attempt to seize any asset of [Perenco], until it has had an opportunity to further hear from the parties on the question of provisional measures.\"\n\n26.\n\nFollowing the seizure of Perenco's oil production on 3 March 2009 and the Parties' subsequent communications to the Tribunal, the Tribunal issued a letter to the Parties on 5 March 2009 emphasizing that \"its February 24, 2009 *request* had and continues to have the same authority as a *recommendation*, as envisaged in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39.\"\n\n27.\n\nThe Parties submitted two rounds of pleadings on Perenco's Application for Provisional Measures, followed by a full hearing in Paris on 19 March 2009. At the end of the hearing the President affirmed that the Tribunal's request of 24 February and recommendation of 5 March were to be treated as in force unless or until they were expressly revoked.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal issued a Decision on Provisional Measures on 8 May 2009. The Decision, in its operative clause, states:\n\n\"The Tribunal considers that circumstances require it to recommend, and it does recommend, provisional measures restraining the Respondents from:\n\n(1) demanding that Perenco pay any amounts allegedly due pursuant to Law 42;\n\n(2) instituting or further pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, including the actions described in the notices dated 19 February and 3 March 2009, to collect from Perenco any payments Respondents claim are owed by Perenco or the Consortium pursuant to Law 42;\n\n(3) instituting or pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, against Perenco or any of its officers or employees, arising from or in connection with the Participation Contracts; and\n\n(4) unilaterally amending, rescinding, terminating, or repudiating the Participation Contracts or engaging in any other conduct which may directly or indirectly affect or alter the legal situation under the Participation Contracts, as agreed upon by the parties.\"5\n\nPMD \u00b679.\n\n29.\n\nIn addition, considering that \"the Respondents should enjoy a measure of security in relation to sums accruing due to them from Perenco (not the Consortium) under Law 42 from the date of this Decision forward until such later decision,\"6 the Tribunal considered that the sums accruing under Law 42 should be paid into an escrow account, for eventual disbursement upon the direction of the Tribunal or by agreement of the Parties. The Tribunal requested the Parties to agree to the terms and conditions of such an account and to establish it within 120 days of the Decision.\n\nPMD \u00b680.\n\n30.\n\nSubsequent to the Tribunal's Decision, Perenco has asserted that Ecuador has \"breached repeatedly\" the Tribunal's Decision by continuing to issue Law 42 assessments on Perenco, despite the fact that Perenco no longer had custody of the oil production from Blocks 7 and 21 following Petroecuador's seizure of the production from both Blocks.7 On 19 May 2009, Perenco informed the Tribunal that the Respondents had breached the Provisional Measures Decision, and that this would have consequences on the continuing operation of the Blocks.\n\nTr. Day 1, 111:7.\n\n31.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, Ecuador physically seized the operations of the Blocks, instructing Perenco employees to ignore any orders from Perenco. On 17 August 2009, Petroecuador sent a notice to Perenco giving the company 10 days to resume its operations in Blocks 7 and 21. By a letter to the Tribunal dated 20 August 2009, Perenco responded that it would comply with this notice if Respondents complied with their obligations under the Provisional Measures Decision and the Contracts.\n\n32.\n\nOn 12 November 2009, the Ecuadorian Ministry of Mines commenced *caducidad* proceedings in order to terminate the Contracts. Perenco and Burlington sent communications to the Ministry requesting that the *caducidad* procedure be suspended pending the decision of this Tribunal. On 20 July 2010, Ecuador declared *caducidad* of the Block 7 and 21 Contracts, effectively terminating them.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Constitution and Reconstitution of the Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal was initially constituted on 21 November 2008, with the following composition: Thomas Bingham of the United Kingdom, appointed as President by the party-appointed arbitrators, after consultation with the parties; Charles N. Brower of the United States, appointed by the Claimant; and J. Christopher Thomas of Canada, appointed by the Respondents.\n\n34.\n\nOn 16 December 2009, following the resignation of Judge Brower, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of the vacancy on the Tribunal and suspended the proceedings pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2). On 13 January 2010, the Claimant appointed Mr. Neil Kaplan of the United Kingdom and the Tribunal was reconstituted. On 17 February, following the resignation of Lord Bingham, the proceedings were suspended again. The Parties were unable to agree on a third arbitrator to serve as the President of the Tribunal and consequently invoked Article 38 of the ICSID Convention to request that the Chairman of the Administrative Council designate the President of the Tribunal. The Chairman designated Judge Peter Tomka, of Slovakia, to sit as President, and the Tribunal was reconstituted on 6 May 2010.\n\n**2. Written Proceedings**\n--------------------------\n\n35.\n\nPerenco filed its Memorial on 10 April 2009. It was accompanied by the witness statements of Mr. Eric D'Argentre, Mr. Laurent Combe, and Mr. Patrick Spink, as well as by the first expert report of Prof. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose.\n\n36.\n\nEcuador and Petroecuador filed, in separate submissions, Objections to Jurisdiction on 17 July 2009. Ecuador's Objections were accompanied by the witness statement of Dr. Christian D\u00e1valos and the first expert reports of Professors Juan Pablo Aguilar, Luis Parraguez Ruiz and Hern\u00e1n Salgado Pesantes. The Respondents made a formal application under Article 41(2) of the Convention that their jurisdictional objections be dealt with as a preliminary question.\n\n37.\n\nOn 17 September 2009, Perenco filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. It was accompanied by the witness statement of Mr. Andrew Derman and the second expert report of Prof. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose, dated 15 September 2009.\n\n38.\n\nEcuador and Petroecuador jointly filed a Reply on Jurisdiction on 17 November 2009, to which they attached the second expert reports of Professors Aguilar and Parraguez.\n\n39.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, Perenco filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, to which it attached the third expert report of Prof. P\u00e9rez Loose.\n\n**3. Hearing on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal held the hearing on jurisdiction from 2 to 4 November 2010 in The Hague, Netherlands. In attendance at the hearing were, in addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary, the following party representatives:\n\n(i) On behalf of Perenco:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Roland Fox, from Perenco\n\n\u2022 Mr. Rodrigo Marquez, from Perenco\n\n\u2022 Mr. Mark W. Friedman, from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\n\u2022 Ms. Sarah H. Wolf, from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Thomas H. Norgaard, from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\n\u2022 Ms. Mary Grace McEvoy, from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ga\u00ebtan Verhoosel, from Covington & Burling LLP\n\n\u2022 Ms. Carmen Mart\u00ednez L\u00f3pez, from Covington & Burling LLP\n\n(ii) On behalf of Ecuador and Petroecuador:\n\n\u2022 Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, Procurador General del Estado\n\n\u2022 Dr. \u00c1lvaro Galindo Cardona, from the Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado\n\n\u2022 Mr. Francisco Paredes, from the Procuradur\u00eda General del Estado\n\n\u2022 Mr. Pierre Mayer, from Dechert LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Eduardo Silva Romero, from Dechert LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Daniel Gal, from Dechert LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa, from Dechert LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jos\u00e9 Caicedo, from Dechert LLP\n\n\u2022 Mr. Lenin Armijos, from EP Petroecuador\n\n41.\n\nAt the hearing, Dr. Christian D\u00e1valos proffered witness evidence and Drs. Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade and Luis Parraguez Ruiz proffered expert testimony on behalf of Ecuador. Mr. Andrew Derman proffered witness evidence and Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose proffered expert testimony on behalf of Perenco.\n\n42.\n\nDr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, Dr. \u00c1lvaro Galindo Cardona, Mr. Pierre Mayer, Mr. Eduardo Silva Romero, Mr. Daniel Gal and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Represa presented oral arguments on behalf of Ecuador. Mr. Mark Friedman and Mr. Ga\u00ebtan Verhoosel presented oral arguments on behalf of Perenco.\n\n43.\n\nThe jurisdictional hearing was recorded and transcribed verbatim, and copies of the recordings and the transcripts were subsequently delivered to the Parties.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal deliberated by various means of communication, including the meetings in The Hague on 4 November 2010 and 7 March 2011. The Tribunal has taken into account all of the pleadings, documents and testimony submitted in this case.\n\n**III. POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Position of the Respondents (Ecuador and Petroecuador)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Ecuador argues the following:\n\ni. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimant's Treaty claims because Perenco is not a French company within the meaning of Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty;\n\nii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Claimant's Block 21 and Block 7 Contract claims because the dispute between the parties is not a \"technical and/or economic dispute\";\n\niii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Petroecuador because Petroecuador is not a party to the Contracts;\n\niv. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Petroecuador because Ecuador has never designated Petroecuador as an agency to ICSID; and\n\nv. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by Claimant in relation to Law 42.\n\n46.\n\nOn the basis of these arguments, the Respondents request the Tribunal to declare that:\n\ni. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Perenco in respect of its Treaty claims;\n\nii. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the claims advanced by Perenco purportedly under the Block 7 and Block 21 Participation Contracts;\n\niii. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to enjoin Ecuador from applying or enforcing Law 42;\n\niv. The Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Petroecuador; and\n\nv. All costs of this phase of the proceedings be awarded to Ecuador and Petroecuador.\n\n**2. Position of the Claimant (Perenco)**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, Perenco argues the following:\n\ni. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimant's Treaty claims because Perenco is a company controlled by French nationals;\n\nii. The Tribunal has *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over Claimant's Block 21 and Block 7 Contract claims because it is a \"technical and/or economic dispute\";\n\niii. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Petroecuador because Petroecuador is a party to the Contracts;\n\niv. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Petroecuador because it is the successor of the Corporaci\u00f3n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana (\"CEPE\"), a government agency designated to ICSID by Ecuador in 1988; and\n\nv. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to enjoin Ecuador from applying Law 42 to Perenco.\n\n48.\n\nOn the basis of these arguments, Perenco requests the Tribunal to reject the Respondents' Jurisdictional Objections in their entirety and to award all costs of this phase of the proceeding to Perenco.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**1. Jurisdiction over the Claimant's Treaty Claims Introduction**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondents' first objection to jurisdiction is rooted in Article 1(3) of the Treaty, which defines the term \"companies\" as:\n\n\"i) Any body corporate constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation and having its registered office there, ii) Any body corporate controlled by nationals of one Contracting Party or by bodies corporate having their registered office in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and constituted in accordance with that Party's legislation.\"8\n\nIt is Respondents' contention that Perenco, which clearly does not fall within the Article 1(3)(i) definition, also does not fall within the Article 1(3)(ii) definition.\n\nC-7 (UNTS, Vol. 1980, p.183)\n\n50.\n\nAs noted above at paragraph 3, on 17 October 2007, the date of its consent to arbitration, 100% of the shares of the Claimant, a Bahamian company, were owned by another Bahamian company, Perenco Gabon S.A. (formerly Perenco S.A.). The 92.5% of Perenco Gabon S.A.'s shares were in turn owned by Perenco S.A. (formerly Perenco Oil & Gas S.A.), also Bahamian, and 100% of Perenco S.A.'s shares were in turn owned by Perenco Limited (now Perenco International Limited), another Bahamian company. The 92.9% of the shares of Perenco International Limited were owned by the late Hubert Firmin Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, a French national.9\n\nExh. E-1; Letter from Debevoise & Plimpton to Dechert (Paris) LLP dated 8 July 2009, enclosing letter from Debevoise & Plimpton to the ICSID Secretariat dated 28 May 2008.\n\n51.\n\nPerenco Ecuador Limited has thus invoked the BIT based upon a chain of corporate ownership that culminates in the late Mr. Perrodo's ownership of 92.9% of the shares of its ultimate parent company. It asserts further that it is controlled by Mr. Perrodo's heirs.10\n\nRA \u00b6 6.\n\n52.\n\nThe Article 1(3) definition of \"companies\", quoted above, encompasses not only juridical persons incorporated under the law of France or Ecuador and having their seat there, but also those incorporated under the law of a third State if they are controlled by nationals of one of the Parties to the BIT or by such bodies corporate as so defined. The Treaty's conferral of the right to claim evidently hinges upon legal persons of third States being controlled by natural or juridical persons of France or Ecuador, as the case may be, and it is the meaning of the word \"controlled\" that divides the disputing Parties.\n\n**A. The First Limb of Respondents' Objection (based on the interaction between Articles 1 and 9 of the Treaty)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Position of the Respondents\n-------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe first limb of the Respondents' objection is based on the interaction between Articles 1 and 9 of the Treaty. They argue that the meaning of the word \"controlled\" in Article 1(3)(ii) is to be discerned from its interaction with Article 9 which, using the Claimant's translation, states that \"[a] company constituted in accordance with the laws in force in one of the Contracting Parties, a majority of whose shares were held, prior to the dispute, by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, shall, in accordance with article 25, paragraph 2(b) of the [ICSID] Convention, be considered for the purposes of the Convention, to be a company of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n54.\n\nUnder Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Treaty must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in light of the treaty's object and purpose. Therefore, the word \"controlled\" in Article 1(3) (ii) \"is to be interpreted in conformity with the text of the Treaty as a whole.\"11 The Respondents argue that Article 1(3) (ii) must be read to be consistent with the terms of Article 9 of the Treaty, which they assert defines \"control\" for purposes of Article 25(2) (b) of the ICSID Convention \"as being the ownership of a majority of the shares in a company.\"12\n\nFROJ \u00b6 21.\n\nFROJ \u00b6 22.\n\n55.\n\nThe objection, put simply, is that the Claimant is a company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas whose shares belong to, and are controlled by, another Bahamian company rather than French nationals. It is contended that the requisite form of control, namely direct control, does not exist and therefore the Claimant lacks standing.13 The Respondents argue that assuming that the heirs to Mr. Perrodo in fact control the ultimate parent of the Claimant (Perenco International Limited) - a point not conceded14 -, the ultimate parent company has standing but the Claimant, separated from French nationals by three layers of companies, does not.15\n\nRRJ \u00b6\u00b6 56-58; Tr. Day 1, 16:16-17.\n\nTr. Day 3, 6: 19-25, 7: 1-23.\n\nTr. Day 1, 25: 4-13.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondents acknowledge that the situation before the Tribunal does not fit within Article 25(2) (b) *in fine* of the ICSID Convention because Perenco Ecuador Limited is not a juridical person of Ecuador but rather is a juridical person incorporated under the law of the Bahamas.16 There is no question therefore of an Ecuadorian juridical person seeking to bring an international claim against Ecuador.\n\nFROJ \u00b6 37; RRJ \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17.\n\n57.\n\nWhat the Respondents seek to derive from Article 9 of the Treaty is somewhat different. They argue that when it came to defining foreign control for the purpose of Article 25(2) (b) *in fine*, the Contracting Parties agreed that it must be direct. The Tribunal understands the Respondents to be arguing that in order to give effect to all terms of the Treaty, such definition must be read back to, and dictates the meaning of, the general definition of \"companies\" in Article 1. The result otherwise would be, in their submission, to render an absurdity because if the test for control used in Article 9 is not also used in Article 1, then a locally incorporated company that *prima facie* would have standing under Article 1 would be deprived of it under Article 9 and this would result in an absurdity, something to be avoided when interpreting a treaty.17\n\nFROJ \u00b6\u00b6 15, 35; RRJ \u00b6 17.\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondents add that for foreign control to exist under Article 9 of the Treaty, the shares must \"belong to\" nationals of the other Contracting Party. They note in this regard that the parties have used different English translations of the authentic French and Spanish texts. The Claimant used a text in which the phrase reads a majority of whose shares *were held*...\" while the Respondents note that the authentic texts used the phrases y cuyas acciones, en su mayor\u00eda *pertenec\u00edan... a*.\" and \". la majorit\u00e9 des actions. *appartient aux*.\" [emphasis added] which both connote, in their view, \"to belong to\" or \"to be held by\", and thus requiring ownership in the sense of actual title to a majority of shares in a company.18 Since the shares of Perenco Ecuador Limited are owned by another Bahamian company, Perenco Gabon S.A. (formerly Perenco S.A.), it is contended that it cannot be said that they are directly controlled by the heirs of the late Mr. Perrodo.\n\nRRJ \u00b6\u00b6 47-54.\n\n(ii) Position of the Claimant\n-----------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant notes that Article 2 of the Treaty provides that its protection shall apply \"to the investments of French nationals or companies in Ecuador.\" and that for \"purposes of determining nationality\" it defines \"companies\" to include not only \"[a]ny body corporate constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party,\" but also \"[a]ny body corporate controlled by nationals of one Contracting Party or by bodies corporate having their registered office in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and constituted in accordance with that Party's legislation.\" (Treaty, Article 1(3) (i) and (ii)). Taken at their face value, it seems obvious that the Claimant falls squarely within the Article 1(3) definition.19\n\nCCM \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n\n60.\n\nIt notes further that there is no dispute that \"since the December 29, 2006 death of Hubert Perrodo, the Perenco Group founder, the entire Perenco Group has been fully owned and controlled by Mr. Perrodo's heirs, consisting of his widow and three children. All are French nationals and his oldest son is now Chairman of the Perenco Group.\"20 Perenco observes that the Respondents \"do not appear to contest that through this complete ownership of the entire Perenco Group the French nationals as heirs to Mr. Perrodo in fact - albeit indirectly - control\" the Claimant.21\n\nCCM \u00b6 9.\n\nCCM \u00b6 9.\n\n61.\n\nTurning to the meaning of \"controlled\" as used in Article 1(3) (ii), the Claimant asserts that its ordinary meaning encompasses control of a company through intermediate holding vehicles.22 The plain meaning of the word \"controlled\" is \"intrinsically broad\"23 and \"encompasses control of a company through intermediate holding vehicles.\"24 Perenco notes that Black's Law Dictionary defines control as \"[t]he direct or indirect power to direct the management and policies of a person or entity, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise; the power or authority to manage, direct, or oversee.\"25\n\nCCM \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.\n\nTr. Day 1, 117: 13.\n\nCCM \u00b6 11.\n\nCCM \u00b6 11.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimant adds that reference to the French and Spanish texts of the Treaty confirms that neither contains any wording that would qualify the scope of the term \"controlled.\"26 In this regard, it points to examples where such dictionaries and the legislation of States contemplate that control encompasses direct and indirect control.27\n\nCCM \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\nCCM \u00b6\u00b6 11-15.\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimant's interpretation is said to be confirmed by the object and purpose of the Treaty which is to develop economic cooperation between the two States and \"to create favourable conditions for French investments in Ecuador\" and *vice versa*.28 Article 1(3) (ii) should be interpreted in light of the Treaty's broad encouragement of investments.29 A broad interpretation is appropriate because it permits investors to structure their investments in the most efficient manners to accomplish their particular business goals, without putting at risk the protections of the Treaty.30\n\nCCM \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.\n\nCCM \u00b618.\n\nCCM \u00b6 19.\n\n64.\n\nWith respect to the Respondents' reliance on Article 9 of the Treaty, the Claimant points out that it addresses the specific situation of a juridical entity that is incorporated under the law of the host State that would not otherwise lack the requisite standing to bring a claim against its own State. The \"purpose of Article 9 is to expand jurisdiction in a very specific factual setting not at issue here\" and it is \"irrelevant\" to the interpretation of Article 1(3).31\n\nCCM \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n\n65.\n\nArticle 25(2) (b) of the ICSID Convention, the Claimant points out, constitutes an exception to the fundamental requirement of diverse nationality and thus creates a special rule that expands the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal.32 Article 9 is the agreement between France and Ecuador to expand jurisdiction under this second category of Convention Article 25(2)(b).33 It does not purport to address the nationality of companies generally (since that is already covered by Article 1(3)) and it is therefore irrelevant to the latter's interpretation.\n\nCCM \u00b6 32\n\nCCM \u00b6 35.\n\n66.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant notes that other ICSID tribunals faced with similar attempts by respondents to use a provision like Article 9 to restrict jurisdiction have rejected such attempts. The cases of *Wena Hotels v. Egypt*34, *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine*35, and *Sempra v. Argentina*36 in particular are cited in support of the view that the second category of Article 25(2)(b), and its progeny like Article 9 of the Treaty at play in this case, \"concern a special circumstance, and that the rules applicable to that circumstance cannot be extrapolated to more general nationality provisions of the first category of Article 25(2)(b) and its progeny, like Article 1(3) of the Treaty here.\"37\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award of December 8, 2000.\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Award of July 26, 2007.\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award of September 28, 2007.\n\nCCM \u00b6 44.\n\n67.\n\nEven if Article 9 were applicable in the instant case, the Claimant considers that that does not require that French nationals hold majority shares directly or (in Ecuador's words) \"in the sense of actual title.\"38 Article 9 does not even include the term \"control\" as the Respondents purport, \"much less \u2018expressly define the word [control] to mean majority equity ownership.'\"39 As such, even if the Respondents are correct that Article 1(3) (ii) must be read narrowly to conform to Article 9, Perenco would qualify as a French national because \"not just a majority but all of Perenco's shares are, and at all relevant times were, indirectly held by the French nationals.\"40\n\nCCM \u00b6 46.\n\nCR \u00b6 13.\n\nCCM \u00b6 48.\n\n68.\n\nFinally, interpreting \"control\" in Article 1(3) (ii) to include indirect control would not create absurd results. It is not uncommon for a BIT to provide substantive rights without providing arbitral remedies.41 Treaties including the Ecuador-Switzerland BIT confer protection on investors without providing any means for arbitration.42\n\nCR \u00b6 22, Tr. Day 1, 144: 6.\n\nCR \u00b6 22.\n\n(iii) Analysis of the Tribunal\n------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nIt is common ground between the disputing Parties that Article 9, second paragraph, of the Treaty defines \"foreign control\" for the purposes of Article 25(2) (b) of the ICSID Convention.43 It is also common ground that Article 9, second paragraph, does not apply to the Claimant since it is not an Ecuadorian legal person.\n\nFROJ \u00b6 22; CCM \u00b6 32; RRJ \u00b6\u00b6 13-17.\n\n70.\n\nArticle 25(2) (b) of the Convention addresses two issues of nationality in relation to juridical persons. Its first sentence sets out the general rule that such persons must have the nationality of a Contracting State other than the Contracting State party to the dispute in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the Centre. Its second sentence addresses the nationality of juridical persons created under the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute. Although the Convention recognizes that any such person has the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute, it can be treated as a national of another Contracting State where \"because of foreign control, the parties have agreed [it] should be treated as a national of another Contracting State.\" In this way the ICSID Convention provides a means for parties to agree that a national of a State that ordinarily could not bring an international claim against its own State would be granted standing under the Convention.\n\n71.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimant is correct to characterize Article 9, second paragraph, of the Treaty as a special rule that, consistent with Article 25(2) (b) *in fine* of the ICSID Convention, is intended to extend ICSID jurisdiction to instances where a national of the State party to the dispute would otherwise have no standing to bring a claim against its own State.\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the Respondents that the Article 9, second paragraph, test of control must be read back into and dictate the meaning of the general definitions of Article 1. While the Respondents disavowed any intent to extrapolate the rules applicable to Article 25(2) (b) *in fine* to the more general definitions contained in Article 1,44 in the Tribunal's view, this is what the objection does. It seems more plausible to apply the Article 1 definitions throughout the Treaty and, when it comes to Article 9 and the special situation envisaged there, to apply that article's specific test of control to a juridical person that is a national of the host State that seeks to claim against its own State. The Tribunal sees no absurdity in this interpretation, nor does it see, to use the Respondents' words, an \"internal inconsistency\" in the Treaty resulting from such an interpretation.45\n\nRRJ \u00b611.\n\nRRJ \u00b610.\n\n73.\n\nGiven Article 9's purpose, it is reasonable for the Contracting Parties to require that foreign control be established in a particular way, in this case choosing to do so by requiring that a majority of the shares of the local company belong to nationals or a juridical person of a Contracting Party other than the respondent party. But it does not follow inexorably that the requirements of Article 9 must dictate the interpretation of Article 1. Accordingly, the first limb of the Respondents' objection is dismissed.\n\n**B. The Second Limb of the Respondents' Objection (based upon the omission of the phrase \"directly or indirectly\" from Article 1(3) (ii) of the Treaty))**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Position of the Respondents\n-------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe second limb of the Respondents' objection is that the BIT's negotiating history shows that the States party to the Treaty deleted a phrase in the definition of \"companies\" that would have permitted a company of a third State that was indirectly controlled by nationals of a Contracting Party to have standing to claim.46 The Tribunal is urged to infer from the express terms of the Treaty and from its negotiating history that control must be direct in order for a company incorporated under the law of a third State to have standing to invoke the bilateral Treaty.\n\nFROJ \u00b6\u00b6 28-50.\n\n75.\n\nThis limb of the objection points out that a draft of the treaty initialled in October 1986 included the phrase \"directly or indirectly\" in Article 1(3) (ii) when defining how juridical persons of third States could be controlled by nationals or companies of a Contracting Party.47 It is noted further that this approach was consistent with the French model BIT at the time that the present Treaty was negotiated. The model BIT provided that \"companies\" included \". toute personne morale constitu\u00e9e sur le territoire de l'une des Parties contractantes, conform\u00e9ment a la l\u00e9gislation de celle-ci y poss\u00e9dant son si\u00e8ge social, ou contr\u00f4l\u00e9e *directement ou indirectement* par des nationaux de l'une des Parties contractantes.\" [emphasis added].\n\nFROJ \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\n76.\n\nThe phrase \"directly or indirectly\" was, in the Respondents' view, \"deliberately excluded\" from Article 1(3) (ii) in the Treaty that was ultimately signed and entered into force.48 The Respondents note that the parties otherwise retained the definition of \"companies\" used in the earlier draft and made it materially identical to the French model BIT except for omitting the words \"directly or indirectly\" when defining the scope of control.49 This stands in contrast to other BITs signed by Ecuador or France where the States Parties to the treaty have expressly defined \"company\" to include legal persons controlled \"directly or indirectly\" by nationals of the other contracting party.50\n\nFROJ \u00b6 38.\n\nFROJ \u00b6\u00b6 67-72.\n\nFROJ \u00b6 40, Exhs. E-53 and E-54.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondents note further that while \"directly or indirectly\" was removed from the definition of \"companies\" it was added to the Article 1(1) definition of \"investment\" in the final version of the Treaty. This is said to reflect the Contracting Parties' intent to broaden that definition (i.e., the object of the Treaty's protections) while narrowing the definition of the legal persons with standing to claim in respect of such investment.51 The Respondents see the changes in wording as intended to protect investments in the hands of each other's nationals and to do so in respect of any direct or indirect ownership of investments, but this was done by expanding the definition of \"investments\" rather than by expanding the class of persons entitled to protect such investments.52 They argue that when the Parties to the BIT meant to convey a broader scope, they deliberately used the phrase \"directly or indirectly,\" as they did in Article 1(1)'s definition of the term \"investment.\"53\n\nFROJ \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\nTr. Day 3, 14: 3-25.\n\nFROJ \u00b6 26.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondents contend that these changes in the structure of the Treaty must have been intentional and must be taken to mean that control cannot be indirect.\n\n79.\n\nFinally, the Respondents reject any suggestion that the Treaty's most favoured nation clause permits Perenco to borrow the provision of any other BIT signed by Ecuador that offers protections to indirectly controlled companies of the other State party. They assert that such a claim merely begs the question, because the MFN clause only applies to \"nationals or companies\" within the meaning of the Treaty, which is the central question here.54 In addition, \"[t]he obligation imposed by Article 5 applies to \u2018nationals or companies of the other party' only \u2018in respect of their investments and activities in connection with such investments.' Perenco's argument that Article 5 operates to expand the *category* of persons to whom the Treaty applies is hopeless.\"55\n\nRRJ \u00b6 78.\n\nRRJ \u00b6 80.\n\n(ii) Position of the Claimant\n-----------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimant responds that the word \"controlled\" without modifiers is clear and unambiguous and should be given its ordinary dictionary meaning.56 If the terms of the treaty can be read without recourse to supplementary materials such as the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, there is no need to consult them.57\n\nCCM \u00b650.\n\nCCM \u00b6\u00b6 49-51.\n\n81.\n\nIf such recourse were relevant, in the Claimant's view, the drafting history of the Treaty does not call into question the ordinary meaning of Article 1(3) (ii). The \"incomplete\" records adduced by the Respondents do not support the contention that the parties deleted the phrase \"directly or indirectly\" before the word \"controlled\" as a way of expressing an agreement to limit qualifying companies only to those \"directly controlled.\"58\n\nCCM \u00b6 51.\n\n82.\n\nThe Claimant argues further in this regard that the deletion of \"directly or indirectly\" does not dictate the conclusion drawn by the Respondents, noting that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) rejected a similar argument in *Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions (Qatar v. Bahrain)*. Likewise, this Tribunal should not draw the conclusion urged upon it.59 If the parties had intended to require direct control, they could have retained that word in order to qualify the meaning of control. They did not do so.60\n\nCCM \u00b6 51.\n\nCCM \u00b6 51.\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimant adds that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* adduced by the Respondents, likened to the *travaux* adduced in the *Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions* case which the ICJ described as \"fragmentary,\"61 are \"inconclusive\" and \"far too equivocal\" to permit any firm conclusion of intent diverging from the ordinary meaning of the terms ultimately used in what became the final version of the Treaty.62\n\nTr. Day 3, 77: 8-14.\n\nCCM \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n\n84.\n\nNor should the Tribunal rely upon the Contracting Parties' \"so-called \u2018treaty practice'\" because first, no method of interpretation permits replacing the clear provisions in a treaty with \"French policy\" or statistics; second, the purported practice is itself \"equivocal\"; and third, if Ecuador in other BITs expressly extended protection to indirectly controlled companies, then the French nationals at issue here should benefit, not suffer, from that practice by application of Article 5, the Treaty's MFN clause.63 If Ecuador in other BITs has extended protection to indirectly controlled companies the French nationals should benefit from such practice in accordance with the MFN provision of the Treaty, Article 5.64\n\nCCM \u00b6 53.\n\nCCM \u00b6 53; Tr. Day 1, 152:17.\n\n85.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant argues that it does not logically follow that deleting the phrase dictates the conclusion urged by the Respondents because the phrase could have also been viewed as redundant.\n\n(iii) Analysis of the Tribunal\n------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the Parties' submissions in light of the text of the applicable Treaty and the rules of treaty interpretation codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. It has not yet arrived at a conclusion on whether the deletion of the words \"directly or indirectly\" could have the effect ascribed to it by the Respondents or whether it is necessary to consult supplementary materials in order to determine the meaning of Article 1(3) (ii). It has decided that it requires further evidence and submissions before it determines the Claimant's standing to invoke the Treaty. This issue is joined to the merits because in the Tribunal's view certain other issues should be clarified prior to arriving at a definitive view as to the Claimant's standing to invoke the Treaty. It will now turn to those issues.\n\n**What is the Claimant's Nationality?**\n---------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIn its written pleadings65 the Claimant has characterized Article 1(3) of the bilateral Treaty as dealing with the \"nationality\" of companies and has urged the Tribunal to find that Perenco Ecuador Limited \"meets the nationality requirements of Article 1(3) (ii) of the Treaty\" and further that \"Perenco is a French company for the purposes of the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.\"66 Likewise, during oral argument, counsel for the Claimant asserted that the various Bahamian companies could be \"French nationals under the treaty\".67 The Respondents too on occasion have treated Article 1(3) (ii) as going to \"nationality requirements.\"68\n\nCCM \u00b6\u00b6 8, 36, 44, 54; CR \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4, 14, 15, 17, 31.\n\nCCM \u00b654.\n\nTr. Day 1, 127: 7-19.\n\nRRJ \u00b6\u00b6 64, 68-69.\n\n88.\n\nUpon closer examination of the Treaty, it is evident to the Tribunal that Article 1(3) (ii) does not expressly purport to confer the nationality of either Contracting Party upon a company incorporated under the law of a third State. Rather, in the definitions article, the term \"national\" is used only in reference to natural persons.69 The standing of companies to bring a claim is addressed, not by the conferral of nationality *per se*, but rather through the place of incorporation and seat of a company or by its being controlled by either nationals or companies of a Contracting Party.\n\nTreaty, Article 1(2).\n\n89.\n\nWhile Article 1 eschews any attempt to confer French or Ecuadorian nationality upon companies incorporated within the Contracting Parties' own territory or in third States, at the same time the Treaty, by its substantive terms, links \"companies\" to one or the other State's Party. For example, Article 2 provides that Treaty protection will apply \"to the investments of *French... companies* in Ecuador.\" (and vice versa) and Article 3 states that the Parties agree to \"permit, promote and facilitate. investments made by. *companies of the other Contracting Party*.\" Article 9 states that each Contracting Party agrees to submit differences between it and \"the nationals *or companies of the other Contracting Party*.\" (emphasis added).\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal approaches the jurisdictional issues mindful of the fact that the only claimant before it is a juridical person incorporated under the law of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas which claims rights of standing under the France-Ecuador BIT. No French national as defined in the Treaty has asserted a claim nor averred that he or she controls the Claimant on his/her own or in concert with other such nationals. As far as the Tribunal is aware, this is the only instance where a juridical person, a national of a third State, has invoked treaty rights held by two other States without there being at least one national of one of the two State parties to the Treaty (or a juridical person incorporated under the law of one of the two States parties) also claiming under the treaty.70\n\nThe case of *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd, Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Holdings, Inc., Mobil Cerro Negro Ltd, and Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction of June 10, 2010, is one example. In that case claims were brought by a Netherlands holding company and companies incorporated under U.S. and Bahamian law. Each claimant invoked the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT.\n\n91.\n\nThis is an unusual situation and the Tribunal considers that care must be exercised in determining whether rights of standing exist in fact and in law. It is beyond dispute that ordinarily a Bahamian company could not claim rights under a bilateral treaty to which the Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a stranger.71\n\n*Mihaly International v. Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2, Award on Jurisdiction of March 15, 2002, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.\n\n**The Negotiating History**\n---------------------------\n\n92.\n\nIn investor-State arbitration, the private claimant does not speak for its State of nationality nor does it necessarily have access to the State's records relating to the negotiating history of the treaty which it invokes. This latter point has been noted in prior proceedings.72\n\nThe point was made by Sir Franklin Berman KCMG, QC in his dissenting opinion in the ICSID *ad hoc* Annulment Committee proceeding in *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, S.A. v. the Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, September 5, 2007: \"Every case of the interpretation of a BIT by an ICSID Tribunal shares this unusual feature, namely that the Tribunal has to find the meaning of a bilateral instrument, one of the Parties to which (the Respondent) will be a party before the Tribunal, while the other Treaty Party by definition will not. Or, to put the matter the other way round, one of the parties to the arbitration before the Tribunal (but not the other) will have been a stranger to the treaty negotiation (see paragraph 70 of the Committee's Decision). That circumstance surely imposes a particular duty of caution on the Tribunal: it can clearly not discount assertions put forward in argument by the Respondent as to the intentions behind the BIT and its negotiation (since that is authentic information which may be of importance), but it must at the same time treat them with all due caution, in the interests of its overriding duty to treat the parties to the arbitration on a basis of complete equality (since it is also possible that assertions by the Respondent may be incomplete, misleading or even self-serving). In other words, it must be very rarely indeed that an ICSID Tribunal, confronted with a disputed issue of interpretation of a BIT, will accept at its face value the assertions of the Respondent as to its meaning without some sufficient objective evidence to back them up.\" (Dissenting Opinion of Sir Franklin Berman KCMG, QC, \u00b6 9.)\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted the apparent deviation of the instant Treaty from other contemporaneous French BITs and indeed the French model BIT at the time. Without having yet reached a position on this issue either substantively or under the applicable rules of treaty interpretation, in light of the Respondents' having adduced some evidence of the Treaty's negotiating history, the Tribunal is interested in receiving any relevant negotiating history of the Treaty that may be in the possession of Ecuador's counter-party, the French Republic.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore invites the Parties to jointly communicate to the French authorities the Tribunal's interest in receiving any *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* that may shed light on the fact that this Treaty appears to differ from other French treaties in terms of the deletion of the words \"directly or indirectly\" from the definition of Article 1(3) (ii) and their insertion in Article 1(1). In particular, the Tribunal wishes to understand the process through which the phrase \"directly or indirectly\" was deleted from Article 1(3) (ii) and was inserted into Article 1(1).\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal is not inviting argument from the French Republic. Rather, it wishes to receive any *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* that may shed light on the way in which this Treaty may differ from other contemporaneous French treaties.\n\n**Further Evidence of Claimed Control**\n---------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe next issue on which the Tribunal wishes to receive further evidence concerns the Claimant's allegation that it is controlled by the heirs of the late Mr. Perrodo.\n\n97.\n\nWhere an investment is owned and/or controlled by the investor/claimant through a series of corporations, typically the claimant will adduce evidence as to how it owns or controls such investment.73 In this case it is the *investment* rather than a French *investor* that has brought the claim and it has sought to adduce evidence of how it is controlled by four non-parties to the arbitration who are nationals of France.\n\nSee, for example, *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of October 2, 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 82-85, 131-152. Likewise, see *AIG Capital Partners Inc. and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/6, Award of October 7, 2003 at \u00b6\u00b6 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, and the chart showing how Claimant No. 1 controlled the investment fund at issue in that case. In *AIG*, the tribunal examined documentary evidence and oral testimony on the way in which a minority US shareholder exercised voting control over a Bermudan company and its wholly owned Bermudan subsidiary which in turn held a 66% ownership, voting control and Board majority interest in a Kazakh joint venture.\n\n98.\n\nThe burden of proof to establish the facts supporting its claim to standing lies with the Claimant. After the Request for Arbitration, in which Claimant stated that it is a company duly incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, by letter dated 21 May 2008, the ICSID Secretariat requested further information pertaining to its standing. On 28 May 2008, documents were filed in support of the claim that French nationals own and control the Claimant. The Claimant submitted its shareholder register and those of the three Bahamian companies interposed between it and the founding shareholder of the companies, Mr. Hubert Perrodo.74 No other corporate records such as by-laws, shareholder agreements, management agreements, etc., were submitted.\n\nRA Exh. 6. It appears that there was a corporate reorganisation after the consent to arbitration by Perenco Ecuador Limited and just prior to the filing of the Request for Arbitration (30 April 2008). A series of new Class A and Class B shares were issued on 7 March 2008. See the share register for Perenco Gabon S.A. (formerly Perenco S.A.).\n\n99.\n\nMr. Perrodo died on 29 December 2006, some ten and a half months before Perenco Ecuador Limited's consent to arbitration on 17 October 2007. Thus, in order to address the issue of who controlled Perenco International Limited and its subsidiaries at the time of the consent to arbitration, the Claimant filed the notarized statement of M. Bernard Reynis, a French lawyer (hereinafter the \"Reynis declaration\"), who attested that Mr. Perrodo's spouse, Ka Yee Wong, and his children, Fran\u00e7ois Hubert Marie Perrodo, Nathalie Perrodo, and Bertrand Nicolas Hubert Perrodo, declared that they wished to establish their hereditary status pursuant to the French Civil Code for those assets of the deceased for which transfer of ownership must be determined in accordance with French law.75\n\nRA Exh. 6.\n\n100.\n\nAt the time of his death the deceased lived outside of France and was recorded by M. Reynis as \"[h]aving the status of \u2018nonresident,' as defined in the tax regulations.\" All of the heirs are recorded in the Reynis declaration as French nationals residing in the United Kingdom, each having the status of non-resident, as defined in the tax regulations.76 The declaration records further that the heirs stated that they were unaware of any last will provisions of the deceased and this was the result of a formal examination of the central archives on 11 January 2007. The declaration also notes that Ms. Wong, as the surviving spouse, inherited, at her discretion, either the totality of the estate in usufruct or full ownership of one fourth of the existing assets of the estate. The three children are also recorded as heirs to the estate.77\n\nRA Exh. 6.\n\nRA Exh. 6.\n\n101.\n\nOn 31 October 2010, prior to the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility, the Tribunal requested clarification as to the relationship between the various Bahamian corporations and the Perrodo estate.78 In its letter dated 1 November 2010, the Claimant stated that the \"share registry of the top company in that chain, Perenco International Limited, shows that its shares *are* owned by Hubert Perrodo (a French national until his death in (2006)...\" [emphasis added] and the \"foregoing documents all relate to the situation following Mr. Perrodo's death, and the facts and relationship they describe have not changed since July 1, 2009.\"79\n\nLetter dated 31 October 2010, to the Parties from the Secretary of the Tribunal. Tr., Day 3, 1:6-25; 2:1-6.\n\nLetter dated 1 November 2010 from Debevoise & Plimpton to the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal's question and a further question posed at the hearing have been met with a reiteration of the points previously made, reference to the documents filed previously and some supplementation by statements of counsel.80 Counsel stated that nothing has changed, either with regard to the share registers or with regard to the estate, since Mr Perrodo's death. The estate evidently has not yet been divided. At the hearing, it was stated further that Mr Perrodo died intestate and that the devolution of his assets is entirely governed by French law.81\n\nFor example, Counsel informed the Tribunal in their letter of 1 November 2010 that Glenmor Energy is owned by Fran\u00e7ois Hubert Marie Perrodo. In responding to the Tribunal's question on Day 3, the Tribunal was informed that Madame Wong is now a director. Transcript, Day 3, 8:14-18 (although no evidence in support of the latter assertion was provided).\n\nTr. Day 3, 81: 14-18.\n\n103.\n\nFor their part, the Respondents stated that their understanding is that since Mr. Perrodo's death his assets are in suspension and the estate has not been distributed. However, they do not accept that the shares of Perenco International Limited are owned by the heirs of Mr Perrodo.82\n\nTr. Day 3, 6-7.\n\n104.\n\nThere is no record evidence as to whether the shares in Perenco International Limited form part of the estate for the purposes of French law (i.e. that they are \"assets of the deceased for which transfer of ownership must be determined in accordance with French law\" to use the words of the Reynis declaration) and thus are to be distributed according to that law.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is being asked to infer that the shares of Perenco International Limited formed part of the estate, that they will be distributed in accordance with French law, and that therefore the Claimant is indirectly controlled by the heirs. The Tribunal is not content to leave this to inference and considers that this must be determined on the basis of evidence rather than counsel's representation.\n\n106.\n\nTherefore, the Claimant is directed to file further evidence in support of its averment that it is controlled by Mr. Perrodo's heirs. In particular, evidence should be filed to prove: (i) that the shares of what is now called Perenco International Limited in fact form part of the estate under French law and are being or will be distributed to the heirs of Mr. Perrodo in accordance with that law; and (ii) the means and instrument(s) through which the heirs have exercised control over the Claimant. The Tribunal recognizes that the heirs may wish to maintain matters pertaining to the estate confidential. The Claimant is at liberty to apply for an order to protect the confidentiality of any testimony and/or any supporting documents.\n\n**2. Jurisdiction** ***Rationae Materiae*** **over Claimant's Contract Claims**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Position of the Respondents**\n----------------------------------\n\n***\"Technical and/or economic\" must be interpreted in light of Clause 20.2***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondents object that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Perenco's Block 21 Contract claims because this dispute is not covered by the Contract's arbitration provisions. Specifically, the Respondents contend that only technical matters involving economic aspects and vice versa may be submitted to ICSID arbitration.\n\n108.\n\nClause 20 of the Block 21 Contract set forth the terms by which certain disputes may be referred to arbitration. Provision 20.2, entitled \"Technical and/or Economic Arbitration,\" provides that \"technical matters involving economic aspects, and vice versa, shall be submitted to consulting and arbitration accepted under Ecuadorian law. Legal matters shall not be subject to arbitration and shall be submitted to the jurisdiction and authority provided in relevant legal provisions.\" The parties also added provisions regarding arbitration via Annex XVI of the Contract. Annex XVI provides that:\n\n\"Once the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes Relating to Investments, ICSID, has been approved by the National Congress of the Republic of Ecuador and, therefore, is fully in force, the Parties agree that any technical and/or economic dispute arising out of the application of the Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon Region, which is the object of the present Contract, shall be resolved according to the provisions of the aforementioned Convention, leaving, accordingly, without effect the Arbitration procedure provided in clause 20 of the Contract.\"\n\n109.\n\nThe Respondents seem to object also to this Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* for the Block 7 Contract. Although the Block 7 Contract contains different arbitration provisions, and does not contain an explicit exclusion of \"legal matters\" from arbitration, this difference is of \"no consequence\" because \"[t]he Parties simply could not contract out of Ecuadorian law concerning arbitrability.\"83 Consequentially, to the extent that Perenco contests the constitutionality or legality of Law 42, the Respondents' *ratione materiae* objection extends to the Block 7 Contract claims as well.\n\nRRJ \u00b6 89.\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondents first argue that the agreement to arbitrate is expressly limited to \"technical and/or economic disputes,\" which this dispute is not. Under Clause 20.2 of the Contract, entitled \"technical and/or economic arbitration,\" only \"technical matters involving economic aspects,\" or \"economic matters involving technical aspects\" arising out of the Block 21 Participation Contract may be submitted to ICSID arbitration.\"84 Annex XVI, which also addresses arbitration of any \"technical and/or economic disputes,\" must be interpreted in light of Clause 20.2. This is required by Ecuadorian law, which states that contract clauses shall be interpreted in conjunction with each other, for the best meaning for the whole contract. Consequently, the phrase \"technical and/or economic disputes\" as used in Annex XVI must be defined as \"any disagreements on technical matters involving economic aspects, and vice-versa.\" Furthermore, the terms of Clause 20.2 and Annex XVI cannot be read to permit disputes that are simply either \"economic\" or \"technical,\" but rather must have aspects of both. To the Respondents, all potential disputes under the Contract have economic consequences, and to permit all disputes with economic consequences to go to arbitration would destroy the limiting effects of Annex XVI.\n\nFROJ \u00b6 74.\n\n111.\n\nSecond, the purpose of Annex XVI was simply to change the procedure, and not the scope, of arbitration. Clause 20.2.19 of the Block 21 Contract provided that\n\n\"In the event that the Ecuadorian Congress approves the Investment Dispute Settlement Agreement (CIADI) and such agreement therefore comes into force and effect, said Agreement shall supersede the Arbitration procedure mentioned in this present Contract.\"\n\n112.\n\nAs such, Clause 20.2.19 indicated that if ICSID was ratified, it would replace the arbitration *procedure* prescribed by the Block 21 Contract. However, \"while the dispute resolution procedure could change, clause 20.2.19 neither altered, nor purported to alter, the subject-matter of the agreement to arbitrate contained in clause 20.2.\"85 Similarly, Annex XVI is designed to affect only the \"arbitration procedure provided in clause 20 of the Contract\" upon ratification of the ICSID Convention. As such, Annex XVI also indicates that only the procedure, and not the subject matter, or scope, of the arbitration provided for under Section 20 was to be replaced.\n\nRRJ \u00b6 94.\n\n***Perenco's dispute is not a \"technical and/or economic\" dispute but rather a legal dispute***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, Perenco has failed to demonstrate that its claims constitute \"disagreements on technical matters involving economic aspects, or vice-versa.\" Instead, Perenco has presented a claim that is primarily legal in nature. However, the parties to the Block 21 Contract clearly intended to exclude legal matters. Mr. Christian D\u00e1valos of Petroecuador, who was involved in the negotiation of the Contract, stated that the arbitration clause was intended to include \"those matters eminently technical that could have important economic implications, such as matters relating to the minimum exploratory program (e.g., how seismic [testing] should be done), drilling (e.g., location of wells, production rates), transportation or environmental technical matters. This concept is, therefore, limited to operational matters and is defined by opposition to legal matters whether concerning the law or the contract itself.\"86 In addition, the Respondents assert that \"[d]isputes over the implementation of the Development Plan, for example, or the unification of fields, were the typical types of examples that the parties understood to fall within the scope of their agreement to arbitrate.\"87\n\nWitness Statement of Christian D\u00e1valos of 8 July 2009 \u00b6 23.\n\nRRJ \u00b6 111.\n\n114.\n\nIn contrast to the matters listed above, Perenco's claims are of a legal nature. Perenco's claims concern the enactment of Law 42, which allegedly breached Clause 8.1 of the Block 21 Contract. Specifically, Perenco's dispute concerns \"the validity of the exercise by the State of its public authority\" and \"whether such exercise is in conformity with Ecuadorian civil law of contract,\" neither of which are issues that can be arbitrated under Ecuadorian law.88 Despite Perenco's assertions, this dispute does not chiefly concern the participation calculation of Clause 8 of the Contract. Consequently, Perenco's case must be resolved using legal criteria, including an analysis of Law 42 and the Contract.\n\nRRJ \u00b6 87.\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondents do not argue that Clause 20.2 and Annex XVI forbid the arbitration of *all* disputes that would require the interpretation and enforcement of the Block 21 Contract. Rather, the Contract's arbitration provisions require that a dispute be predominantly economic or technical in character, and not predominantly legal.\n\n116.\n\nFinally, the exclusion of \"legal matters\" is not in violation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that the jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to \"any legal dispute\" arising out of an investment. \"Legal disputes\" as used in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and \"legal matters\" as used in the Block 21 Contract are two different concepts. Article 25 is much broader, encompassing both legal matters but also technical or economic disputes. Furthermore, the ICSID concept of \"legal disputes\" is an international legal concept, while \"legal matters\" is defined by Ecuadorian law.\n\n**B. Position of the Claimant**\n-------------------------------\n\n***Annex XVI permits arbitration of any economic dispute, such as the present dispute***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nAnnex XVI of the Block 21 Contract permits arbitration of \"any... economic dispute related to\" that Contract. Perenco's claims, which concern one of the fundamental economic terms of the Block 21 Contract, are clearly \"economic\" in nature. The language of Annex XVI, which covers \"any\" dispute, that is either technical \"and/or\" economic, is expansive.\n\n118.\n\nEcuador is wrong to rely on the narrow language of Clause 20.2 for its assertion that only \"technical matters involving economic aspects and vice versa\" can be arbitrated under the Contract, because this language is not included in Annex XVI. First, Annex XVI expressly displaced Clause 20.2, by providing after ratification of Convention, technical and/or economic disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, \"thus leaving without effect the arbitration procedure set out in clause twenty of the Contract.\" The Respondents are wrong to assert that Annex XVI only displaced the \"arbitration procedure\" provisions of Clause 20.2. \"Arbitration procedure\" as used in Annex XVI \"includes the kind of disputes that could be subject to arbitration under Clause 20.\"89 Furthermore, Annex XVI is \"not purely procedural. In paragraph 7, it contains a substantive term concerning allocation of the expenses and fees of the arbitral tribunal. In paragraph 8, it contains a substantive term regarding consequential damages.\"90\n\nCR \u00b6 44.\n\nCR \u00b6 46.\n\n119.\n\nSecond, the Parties intended that Annex XVI would replace the prior dispute resolution clause in its entirety according to Mr. Andrew Derman of Oryx, the then-representative for the Contractors during negotiations. Both the \"bases for contracting\" and the Hydrocarbons Law allowed for arbitration of \"technical or economic disputes.\"91\n\nTr. Day 1, 156: 6.\n\n120.\n\nThird, Ecuador is wrong to assert that Clause 20.2 and Annex XVI are to be read together, such that \"technical matters involving economic aspects and vice versa\" language of Clause 20.2 defines the \"technical and/or economic\" language of Annex XVI. According to Perenco, \"Clause 20.2 was self-evidently meant to apply before congressional approval of the ICSID Convention, while Annex XVI was meant to apply after congressional approval of the ICSID Convention.\"92 The mere fact that Clause 20.2 is entitled \"technical and/or economic arbitrations\" does not mean that the language used in Clause 20.2 regarding \"technical matters involving economic aspects and vice versa\" must be imputed to Annex XVI to further define Annex XVI's reference to \"technical and/or economic disputes.\" Definitions are spelled out in Clause 3.3 of the Contract, not in Clause 20.2, and Clause 3.1 states that section headings are included \"merely for identification and reference purposes.\"93\n\nCR \u00b6 48.\n\nTr. Day 1, 169: 1.\n\n***Even if the Block 21 Contract does limit arbitration to \"technical matters involving economic aspects and vice versa,\" Perenco meets this standard***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nAssuming that the Respondents are correct that only \"technical matters involving economic aspects and vice versa\" can be submitted to arbitration, Perenco's claims still meet this definition. Perenco asserts that the dispute is \"plainly of an economic character,\" and that it is also \"a dispute with technical aspects.\"94 The dispute can be resolved by reference to these economic criteria in the Contract, which involve technical aspects. For example, the calculation of Perenco's participation requires the determination of the daily average output, variables that are competencies of hydrocarbons engineers.\n\nCCM \u00b6 77\n\n122.\n\nMoreover, the dispute does not concern \"legal matters\" as this is meant under Clause 20.2. As an initial matter, this prohibition of \"legal matters\" is not applicable, because it is only contained in Clause 20.2 of the Block 21 Contract, not in the Annex XVI that replaced it. Second, Clause 20.2's exception for \"legal matters\" represents a \"carve out\" for matters that \"must be decided by the competent authority\" even if they were otherwise subject to the arbitration clause; in other words, \"\u2018legal matters' simply meant those matters which were not amenable to arbitration under Ecuadorian law.\"95\n\nCCM \u00b6 80.\n\n123.\n\nFurthermore, the exclusion of \"legal matters\" cannot be read \"to exclude all matters of interpretation and enforcement of the Block 21 Contract and the underlying law.\"96 Under Ecuadorian law, a decision by arbitrators should be based on law. Clause 22.1 of the Contract recognizes the ICSID Convention as part of the \"legal framework\" of the Contract. Article 25(1) of the Convention provides that the jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to \"any legal dispute\" arising out of an investment. It wouldn't make sense for the Parties to agree to arbitration under the Convention for resolution of legal disputes, only to then reject arbitration of legal disputes and permit it only for \"technical matters.\"\n\nCCM \u00b6 82.\n\n124.\n\nFinally, Perenco is not contesting the constitutionality or legality of Law 42 and its regulations. Rather, even if they were enacted in a manner permitted by Ecuadorian law, they nevertheless breached the Participation Contracts.\n\n**C. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n**Jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae*** **under the Block 21 Participation Contract**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with recalling the provisions of the Block 21 Participation Contract relating to arbitration. They are contained in Section Twenty, entitled \"Consultation and Technico-Economic Arbitration.\"\n\nClause 20.2.12 provides that:\n\n\"The arbitration shall be guided by the provisions of this Contract, annex XVI, the documents that are related with the case submitted for arbitration, and Ecuadorian laws, as the case may be.\"\n\n126.\n\nThe relevant parts of Annex XVI read as follows:\n\n\"Once the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes Relating to Investments, ICSID, has been approved by the National Congress of the Republic of Ecuador, and, therefore, is fully in force, *the Parties agree that any technical and/or economic dispute arising out of the application of the Participation Contract* for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21., which is the object of the present Contract, *shall be resolved according to the provisions of the aforementioned Convention, leaving, accordingly, without effect the arbitration procedure in clause twenty of the Contract.*\n\nFor the application of the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes Relating to Investments, ICSID, the following procedural rules shall also apply:\n\n1. *The Parties agree to submit* to the INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES *any technical and/or economic dispute* relating to this Participation Contract.through the [system] of *arbitration*, which for all effects is hereafter referred to as \"THE CENTRE.\"\n\n2. *The Parties acknowledge* that *the object of the Participation Contract* implies the making of *investments*, so that the ICSID Arbitration procedure is applicable to the Contract.\n\n3. The Parties acknowledge that the *Contractor's right to submit any technical and/or economic dispute* to the CENTRE shall not affect the Contractor's ability to receive total or partial compensation from any third party in relation to any damage or loss of the object in dispute.\" (Italic emphasis added).\n\n127.\n\nWhen the Block 21 Participation Contract was executed in 1995, Ecuador was not a Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention. This explains the language used in Clause 20.2.12 providing for the arbitration to be governed by different rules depending on whether Ecuador was or was not a Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention at the moment of the institution of the arbitral proceedings.\n\n128.\n\nIt is not disputed that Ecuador was a Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention on 30 April 2008 when Perenco instituted the present arbitral proceeding by filing its Request for Arbitration with the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n129.\n\nThis is the scenario precisely contemplated by Annex XVI of the Block 21 Participation Contract. The Parties expressly agreed that once the ICSID Convention is in force for Ecuador, \"any technical and/or economic dispute arising out of (\"derivada\") the application of the Participation Contract\" shall be resolved through the arbitration within ICSID in accordance with \"the provisions of the [ICSID] Convention.\" Further, the Parties agreed that the fact of the ICSID Convention being in force for Ecuador rendered \" *without effect the arbitration procedure provided in clause twenty of the Contract*.\"\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal thus considers that it is Annex XVI which is applicable to the present case and has to be looked at when determining the Tribunal's competence over contractual claims, including its scope *ratione materiae*. At the same time, the provision of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention has to be recalled. It provides that \"[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any *legal* dispute arising directly out of an *investment*, between a Contracting State.and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\" The requirements of this provision have to be met in the case at hand.\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondents do not argue that the dispute does not arise directly out of an investment. In fact, the dispute concerns Ecuador's compliance with its obligations under the Participation Contract. The Parties in Annex XVI expressly \"acknowledge that the object of the Participation Contract...implies the making of investments, so that *the ICSID Arbitration procedure is applicable to the Contract*.\"\n\n132.\n\nEcuador further accepts that the dispute at hand is a legal one. It expressly admits that Perenco's contract claims in relation to Block 21 \"are undoubtedly of a legal nature and involve legal matters.\"97\n\nFROJ \u00b6 83.\n\n133.\n\nIt is precisely because of this admitted qualification of Perenco's claim as \"involving legal matters,\" that Ecuador is now challenging the jurisdiction of ICSID and the Tribunal's competence, relying on Clause 20.2 of the Block 21 Participation Contract which provides that \"[l]egal matters may not be submitted to arbitration and shall be submitted to the jurisdiction set forth in the applicable legal provisions.\" Ecuador maintains that the Tribunal has no competence over Perenco's contract claims as \"they do not involve any \u2018 *technical and/or economic* ' matter.\"98\n\nFROJ \u00b6 84, emphasis in the original.\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that this interpretation based on the opposition of \"legal\" versus \"technical and/or economic\" cannot be accepted as it would result in depriving Annex XVI of its applicability in general. The ICSID Convention requires the dispute to be a legal one. This requirement was adopted, after some discussion, and was explained in the Report of the Executive Directors which states\n\n\"26.... The expression \"legal dispute\" has been used to make clear that while conflicts of rights are within the jurisdiction of the Centre, mere conflicts of interests are not. The dispute must concern the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for breach of a legal obligation.\"\n\n135.\n\nThe Parties to the Block 21 Participation Contract agreed, in its Annex XVI, \"to submit to the INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES any\n\ntechnical and/or economic dispute relating to this Participation Contract.\" It is thus the task of the Tribunal to ascertain whether the contractual claims advanced by Perenco in this arbitration concern a \"technical\" or \"economic\" dispute relating to the Block 21 Participation Contract. The language \"and/or\" suggests that the dispute does not need to be of a cumulative nature, i.e., \"technical and economic.\" The Tribunal does not accept the Respondents' attempt to treat \"and/or\" as requiring that a dispute be technical and economic. It is sufficient if it is either technical or economic.\n\n136.\n\nIn its Memorial, Perenco when introducing its contract claims stated:\n\n\"142. By the enactment of Law 42 and the issuance of the Implementing Regulations, Respondents have also breached their obligations under the Contracts, in particular Clause 8.1, and violated the Constitutional proscriptions of confiscation, discrimination and retroactivity of laws.\"\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the alleged violation of the Ecuadorian Constitution, its provisions on confiscation, discrimination and retroactivity of laws concerns essentially legal matters, and cannot qualify as a \"technical and/or economic dispute relating to [the] Participation Contract.\" These matters are not covered by the Parties' consent to arbitration under Annex XVI and therefore lie outside the Tribunal's competence.\n\n138.\n\nPerenco, as quoted in para. 136 above, alleges the violations by the Respondents of \"their obligations under the Contracts, in particular Clause 8.1.\"\n\n139.\n\nClause 8.1, which follows the title of this clause\n\n\"PARTICIPATION AND DELIVERY AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES\" reads as follows:\n\n\"8.1- Calculation of the Contractor's Share: The Contractor's Share shall be calculated using the parameters set out hereunder, in accordance with the following formula:\n\nPC = X.Q\n\nWhere:\n\nPC = Contractor's Share\n\nQ = annual Inspected Output in the Contract Area\n\nX = Average factor, in a percentage, corresponding to the Contractor's Share. It is calculated using the following formula:\n\nX = (X1.q1 + X2.q2 + X3.q3)/q + Y\n\nwhere:\n\nq = is the daily average annual Inspected Output\n\nq1 = is the part of q less than L1\n\nq2 = is the part of q between L1 and L2\n\nq3 = is the part of q greater than L2\n\nThe parameters L1, L2, X1, X2 and X3 offered by the Contractor and [illegible] hereunder, are the following:\n\nL1 = 30,000 barrels a day\n\nL2 = 60,000 barrels a day\n\nXI = 67.5%\n\nX2 = 60.0%\n\nX3 = 60.0%\n\nL1 and L2 shall be expressed in the same units as q, that is, in barrel. L1 and L2 serve to delimit three intervals of production.\n\nThe parameters X1, X2 and X3 are associated with the three production intervals; they are percentages and therefore must be between 0 and 100, and X3 must be less than or equal to X2 and less than X1.\n\n\"Y\" is a correction parameter with respect to the quality (C) of the Crude Oil produced in the Contract Area, expressed as a percentage. If the Crude oil from the Contract Area is of a quality less than 25 API, but greater than 15 API, there is compensation on behalf of the Contractor, and on behalf of the State whenever the Crude Oil produced in the Contract Area is of a quality greater than 25, but less than 35 API, and is calculated in the following manner:\n\na) If 15 API < C < 25 API, then Y = 2.0 x (25-C)\n\nb) If 25 API < C < 35 API, then Y = 1.0 x (25-C)\n\nc) If C > 35 API, Y = -10\n\n\"C\" is the average annual quality of Crude Oil from the Contract Area, measured in API degrees.\n\nThe State's Share of these discoveries may not be less than twelve point five percent (12.5%) when the gross output of crude oil does not reach thirty thousand barrels a day. The share shall go up to a minimum of fourteen percent (14%) when the daily output is between thirty thousand and sixty thousand barrels; and it shall not be less than eighteen point five percent when production exceeds sixty thousand barrels a day. Consequently, the Contractor's Share may not exceed, in any event, the limits of eighty-seven point five percent, eighty-six percent, and eighty-one point five percent, respectively. Average daily annual output (q) shall be estimated in advance by the Contractor and agreed to by PETROECUADOR to establish the amount of the Contractor's Share each month. These estimates may be adjusted quarterly. To calculate the definitive amount, the annual Inspected Output from the current period shall be used.\"\n\n140.\n\nAs it can be seen, Clause 8.1 constitutes a complex and detailed formula for the calculation of the Contractor's share in the crude oil produced in the contract area. This is a key provision relating to sharing of the *economic benefits* between the Parties to the Block 21 Participation Contract.\n\n141.\n\nPerenco complains in its Memorial that the Respondents \"enacted and began to enforce Law 42, which in effect unilaterally amended the participation percentages such that Respondents now claim for themselves 99% of all oil revenues above relatively low reference prices.\"99\n\nCM \u00b6 1.\n\n142.\n\nLaw 42 leaves no doubt that the main and principal reasons for its adoption were economic considerations. Its Preamble states inter alia that \"it is necessary to apply criteria of justice and equity within oil and gas procurement processes, so that contracts [with investors] will be framed within principles of *economic equilibrium* and legal certainty for the parties.\" It further states that \"the *economic* conditions of those *contracts* have changed, exclusively in favour of the contractor companies.\" It further adds that \"[t]he international price of a barrel of oil is a fundamental element to be considered in order to maintain the economic equilibrium of the relationship between the investor and the government.\" The Preamble of Law 42 finally states that:\n\n\"It is indispensable to incorporate in the substantive part of the Hydrocarbon Law principles regarding *economic and financial equilibrium*, as well as principles of legal certainty that make it possible to perform the participation contracts signed by the Ecuadorian government based on criteria of justice and equity for the parties.\"\n\n143.\n\nArticle 2 of Law 42 provides:\n\nFollowing Article 55 [of the Hydrocarbons Law], add the following:\n\n\"Article. Participation of the State in surplus prices from the sale of oil and gas not agreed upon or not foreseen. Contractor companies that maintain participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in effect with the Ecuadorian state under this Law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil subject to participation that corresponds to them, when the effective monthly medium price of FOB sale of Ecuadorian oil petroleum goes above the monthly average prices in effect at the time of the execution of the contract, expressed in constant prices for the month of liquidation, will recognize in favour of the Ecuadorian state a participation of at least 50% of the extraordinary income generated by the difference in price. For purposes of this Article, extraordinary revenues shall be understood to mean the difference in the above-described price, multiplied by the number of barrels produced.\n\nThe price of crude oil as of the date of the contract used as a reference for calculation of the difference shall be adjusted, considering the Consumer Price Index of the United States of America, published by the Central Bank of Ecuador.\"\n\n144.\n\nFinally, the Interim Provision of Law 42 reads as follows:\n\n\"As of the date this Law goes into effect, and until the corresponding Regulations to the Law Amending the Hydrocarbons Law are issued, the minimum percentage of State participation in the extraordinary revenues shall apply, that is, 50%, established in Article 2 of this Amending Law.\"\n\n145.\n\nThe Claimant is of the view that Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations, \"in effect unilaterally amended the participation percentages,\" despite the fact that Clause 15.2 of the Contract expressly provides that \"any amendments to participation contracts require mutual agreement of the parties.\"100 Claimant thus alleges that Ecuador breached its obligations under the Contract, in particular Clause 8.1.101\n\nCM \u00b6 146.\n\nCM \u00b6 142.\n\n146.\n\nThe aim of Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations was to affect the economic conditions of the contracts in order \"to maintain the economic equilibrium of the relationship between the investor and the government.\"102 The Claimant disagrees with that attempt by Ecuador and challenges its conformity with Ecuador's obligations under the Participation Contract. The Tribunal has no doubt that the dispute concerning the participation percentages in the share of the produced crude oil qualifies as an \"economic dispute relating to th[e] Participation Contract\" in the sense of Annex XVI.\n\nLaw 42, Preamble, para. 6.\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that it has competence over the Claimant's contract claims based on the allegations that Ecuador has breached its obligations under the Block 21 Participation Contract.\n\n**Jurisdiction** ***ratione materiae*** **under the Block 7 Participation Contract**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondents have taken an ambiguous position with regard to the Tribunal's competence over contract claims relating to the Block 7 Participation Contract.\n\n149.\n\nThey have not raised any objection to the jurisdiction *rationae materiae* under the Block 7 Participation Contract in their Objection filed on 17 July 2009. That jurisdiction was not challenged. No relief is being sought by Ecuador when summarizing the relief sought from the Tribunal in paragraph 106 of the Objections to Jurisdiction.103\n\nFROJ \u00b6 106\n\n150.\n\nThe objection appears for the first time in the Respondents' Reply on Jurisdiction, filed on 17 November 2009. The Respondents request the Tribunal to declare that it \"has *no subject-matter jurisdiction* over the claims advanced by Perenco purportedly under the *Block 7* and Block 21 Participation Contracts.\"104 No separate chapter is devoted to a more detailed argument against such jurisdiction under the Block 7 Participation Contract, in contrast to arguments against the subject-matter jurisdiction under the Block 21 Participation Contract claims.105\n\nRRJ \u00b6 242.\n\nId. at \u00b6\u00b6 82-118.\n\n151.\n\nThe issue of the jurisdiction under the Block 7 Participation Contract is mentioned just *en passant*, in six sentences, when discussing the alleged lack of jurisdiction under the Block 21 Participation Contract. The Respondents state the following:\n\n\"While the parties to [the Block 21] contract expressly excluded [legal] matters from the scope of their agreement to arbitrate, their failure to do so in the Block 7 Participation Contract is of no consequence. The parties simply could not contract out of Ecuadorian law concerning arbitrability. The *objection to jurisdiction is*, therefore, pressed in relation *to Perenco's Block 7 contract claims* as well.\"106\n\nAnd then they add:\n\n\"There is plainly no prejudice to Perenco in the objection being raised now in relation to Block 7 as well. In any event, the Tribunal is required of its own motion, to establish its jurisdiction pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 41. That jurisdiction is manifestly absent in so far as Perenco purports to agitate (sic) the validity, either as a matter of Ecuadorian constitutional law or civil law, of the enactment of Law 42 and the promulgation of the Implementing Regulations.\"107\n\nRRJ \u00b6 89; emphasis added\n\nRRJ \u00b6 90, footnote omitted.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimant in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction states that \"Respondents' objection to jurisdiction over Perenco's Block 7 Contract claims is untimely.\"108 It refers to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) which requires that any objection to jurisdiction shall be made as early as possible. But the Claimant also states that \"[i]n this arbitration Perenco does not contest the Ecuadorian \"constitutionality or legality\" of Law 42 and its implementing regulations. Rather, Perenco contends that even if Law 42 and the implementing regulations were enacted in a manner permitted by Ecuadorian law, they nevertheless breached the Participation Contracts.\"109\n\nCR \u00b6 67.\n\nCR \u00b6 63.\n\n153.\n\nWhen presenting its jurisdictional objections during the hearing, Counsel for the Respondents stated that \"Ecuador and Petroecuador challenge the jurisdiction of [the] Tribunal over *almost all* of [Perenco's] claims. In fact, *all of them with one exception.* \"110.\n\nTr. Day 1, 11: 3-5; emphasis added.\n\n154.\n\nIt seems that the \"one exception\" encompasses Perenco's claims under the Block 7 Participation Contract. When Counsel, at the end of his general presentation, outlined the way and the subject-matter his colleagues would cover in their presentation, no mention was made of jurisdiction over claims brought under the Block 7 Participation Contract, in contrast to explicit mentioning of claims brought under the Block 21 Participation Contract.111\n\nTr. Day 1, 4: 5-6.\n\n155.\n\nNevertheless, another Counsel for Ecuador briefly \"revived\" the objection to jurisdiction *ratione materiae* under the Block 7 Participation Contract when he stated that \"to the extent that Perenco is contesting.either the constitutionality or the legality of Law 42 and its implementing decrees, we object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. *[t]his objection pertains to both. the Block 7 Participation Contract* and the Block 21 Participation Contract\"112.\n\nTr. Day 1, 89-90: 24-06; emphasis added\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondents raised the issue relating to its competence under the Block 7 Participation Contract rather late. Under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, not only any objection that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible; the Rule states that \"a party shall file the objection. no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial. unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\"\n\n157.\n\nNo new fact was relied on by the Respondents when they extended their original objection to the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to the Block 21 Contract claims to the Block 7 Contract claims as well \"to the extent that Perenco is contesting either the constitutionality or legality of Law 42.\"\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Claimant's statement that it \"does not contest the Ecuadorian \"constitutionality or legality\" of Law 42 and its implementing regulations.\"113\n\nCR \u00b6 63.\n\n159.\n\nIn view of the above, it seems that the issue raised by the Respondents, if it were to be construed as an objection, has become moot.\n\n160.\n\nThe relevant arbitration clause in the Block 7 Participation Contract, clause 20.3, reads as follows:\n\n\"Notwithstanding the above, from the date the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other Countries (\"the Convention\"), signed by Ecuador, as a State member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, on January 15, 1986 and published in the Official Journal No. 386 of March 3, 1986, is approved by the Ecuadorian Congress, the Parties shall submit the controversies or differences arising out or related to the performance of this Contract to the jurisdiction and competence of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to be determined and resolved under the above referenced Convention.\"\n\n161.\n\nPerenco claims that Ecuador breached its obligations under the Block 7 Participation Contract.114 These claims concern \"differences arising out or related to the performance of [the Block 7 Participation] Contract.\" They thus fall within the jurisdiction of the Centre and competence of this Tribunal.\n\nCM \u00b6 142.\n\n**3. Jurisdiction** ***Rationae Personae*** **over Petroecuador**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondents next object that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claims asserted by Perenco against Petroecuador. The Respondents have advanced two arguments in this respect. They assert that Petroecuador has not been designated to ICSID as it must be in accordance with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention before it can be considered to have consented to this Tribunal's jurisdiction. They also assert that because Petroecuador is not a party to either the Block 7 or Block 21 Participation Contracts, it never consented to arbitration pursuant to the Contracts' arbitration clauses. The Tribunal will start with the latter assertion.\n\n**A. Petroecuador's Role under the Participation Contracts**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Position of the Respondents\n-------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Petroecuador. Their first argument is that Petroecuador is a representative of Ecuador and that therefore it is not a party to the Participation Contracts. Respondents rely primarily on the sentence \"the Ecuadorian State, through Petroecuador\" In the Participation Contracts. In addition, the Respondents maintain that jurisdiction against Petroecuador should fail since the Claimant has not formulated any valid claims against Petroecuador.\n\n***Participation Contracts clearly define the parties as Ecuador and the Contractor***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Respondents contend that Petroecuador is not and legally cannot be a party to the Block 7 and Block 21 Participation Contracts, and consequently cannot be subject to arbitration. The Contracts clearly indicate that the two parties to the Contracts are the Contractor and Ecuador. Clause 1 of both the Block 7 and 21 Contracts, entitled \"Appearances of the participation contract,\" state that \"the following Parties have appeared to execute this Contract: The Ecuadorian State, through Petroecuador, on the one hand,\" and the contractor on the other. Clauses 3.3.22 of Block 7 Contract and 3.3.25 of Block 21 Contract define the \"Parties\" to be \"The Ecuadorian State, through Petroecuador, and the Contractor.\" Clause 3.3.32 of Block 21 Contract defining Petroecuador, says it \"represents the Ecuadorian state.\" Finally, the arbitration clauses in both the Block 7 and 21 Contracts state that it is the \"Parties\" who are subject to arbitration.\n\n165.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, Petroecuador's status as representative to the Ecuadorian State for purposes of the Contracts is fully consistent with the Ecuadorian legal framework on hydrocarbons. Article 12-A of the Hydrocarbons Law sets forth the model for participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons, as \"such contracts executed by the State, through PETROECUADOR[\u2026]\" Article 2 of the Regulations implementing Law 44 amending the Hydrocarbons Law states that \"the parties to the contract are the Ecuadorian State, represented by PETROECUADOR, as contracting party, and the contractor lawfully established in the country that was awarded the contract.\" Finally, both the bases for the Seventh Bidding Round and the *Proforma* Contract for the Seventh Bidding Round employ the same \"through PETROECUADOR\" language to describe the parties.\n\n166.\n\nThe Respondents assert that the language used in the Contracts and the legal framework is clear: \"[o]n any reading of the clause, the word \"through\" indicates that Petroecuador acts as agent for the Ecuadorian State.\"115 The original Spanish term, \"por intermedio de,\" \"anticipates the existence of a principal on whose behalf another acts as intermediary.\"116 Since the text of the Contracts is clear, \"the adjudicator need not go any further; it must apply the clear words of the contract.\"117\n\nRRJ \u00b6 139.\n\nRRJ \u00b6 144.\n\nRRJ \u00b6 178.\n\n***Petroecuador's functions under the Contracts are consistent with those of a representative***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nBy its establishing legislation, Petroecuador is the instrument of the State designed to develop the oil sector in Ecuador. Because it is entrusted with representing the State in contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons, it has \"been endowed with certain powers and functions in relation to the performance of participation contracts on behalf of Ecuador.\"118 However, as an administrative entity acting in furtherance of its administrative functions in relation to a contract, Petroecuador does not become a contracting party.\n\nRRJ \u00b6 171.\n\n168.\n\nFirst, because oil is the State's inalienable and imprescriptible property under the Ecuadorian Constitution, only the State can, pursuant to Ecuadorian law, agree to give a portion of the oil produced to private contractors. Perenco's arguments would lead to the conclusion that the State's right to sell hydrocarbons has been transferred to Petroecuador, which is impossible under Ecuadorian law.\n\n169.\n\nSecond, Petroecuador's role in the Block 7 and Block 21 Participation Contracts is fully consistent with the representative status it was given under the Ecuadorian legal framework for hydrocarbons. Petroecuador's role under the Contracts is to receive the State's participation on behalf of the State. Petroecuador receives no economic benefit from the Contracts' performance, and its rights are limited to being kept informed of and inspecting performance of the Contractors' technical and economic and contractual activities.\n\n170.\n\nIn this regard, none of Petroecuador's \"obligations\" on which Perenco relies as evidence of Petroecuador's party status render Petroecuador a party. For example, clause 5.2.6 of the Block 21 Participation Contract \"merely restates some of Petroecuador's duties and functions pursuant to Article 59 to 62 of the Hydrocarbons Law concerning the transportation of hydrocarbons for and on behalf of the State.\"119 Other clauses are simply provisions by which Petroecuador assists in facilitating performance of the essential obligations of the Contracts. Still other clauses related to the execution of ancillary contracts and amendments or transfers, but these activities are not incompatible with the status of agent, they are likewise executed on behalf of the state, and require approval and oversight. Finally, the dispute resolution clauses refer only to the parties, not to Petroecuador as well.\n\nRRJ \u00b6 152.\n\n171.\n\nThird, Petroecuador's conduct in negotiating and performing under the Contracts has not transformed its status into that of a party. Perenco hasn't shown that Petroecuador either accepts performance on its own behalf or that it performs obligations as principal. Petroecuador's role during the Contracts' negotiations was limited to executing the Contracts, once they had been approved by CEL, on behalf of the State. CEL played the central role by calling the bidding rounds, receiving and evaluating bids, awarding participation contracts and negotiating participation contracts. In contrast, Petroecuador was only designated to \"execute\" the Contracts on behalf of the State.\n\n172.\n\nFourth, despite Perenco's assertions to the contrary, Petroecuador's prior conduct in relation to other contracts is irrelevant to whether it was a party to the Block 7 and 21 Contracts. Furthermore, in the *Repsol*120 and *Occidental I*121 cases cited by Perenco, it simply was not debated whether Petroecuador was a party to the contracts at issue. In *Repsol*, the key issue concerned whether the dispute arose out of a services contract or the participation contract. Because Petroecuador ultimately consented to ICSID arbitration, the Annulment Committee did not have to consider which contract applied and consequently who the proper parties were. No contract claims were advanced in *Occidental I*.\n\n*Repsol YPF Ecuador v. Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10, Decision on the Application for Annulment of January 8, 2007.\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. the Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL Arbitration Case No. UN 3467, Final Award of July, 1 2004.\n\n173.\n\nFinally, the Respondents assert that Perenco does not actually have any dispute against Petroecuador. Even if Petroecuador could be considered as a party to the Contracts, Perenco has made no allegation that Petroecuador has breached any of those obligations. Without a claim that actually implicates Petroecuador, this Tribunal cannot take jurisdiction over Petroecuador.\n\n(ii) Position of the Claimant\n-----------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Claimant presents several arguments which tend to illustrate that Petroecuador is a party to the Participation Contracts. First, the Claimant submits that the wording of the Contracts makes clear that Petroecuador is a principal as well as an agent of Ecuador. Second, the Claimant contends that Petroecuador's participation in the negotiation of the Contracts demonstrates that Petroecuador intended to be a party to the Contracts. Third, the Claimant argues that Petroecuador's involvement in the performance of the Contracts shows that Petroecuador is an independent party to the Contracts. In particular, the Claimant emphasises that Petroecuador had a distinct juridical personality from Ecuador, its own patrimony, and operational autonomy to execute specific rights and obligations. Fourth, the Claimant maintains that Petroecuador never contested being a party to similar contracts in other ICSID arbitrations.\n\n***Petroecuador has the rights and obligations of a party to the Contracts***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nFirst, Perenco asserts that Petroecuador is a party under the Contracts because it has rights and obligations under the Contracts. Under Ecuadorian law, the intention of the contracting parties shall prevail over the literal sense of the words. Because the Contracts indicate that Petroecuador intends to be bound by its rights and obligations under the Contracts, Petroecuador is to be considered a \"party\" to the contract under Ecuadorian law. Clauses 5.6.1 of both Contracts state that\n\n\"The Contractor assumes full responsibility towards the Ecuadorian State and Petroecuador with respect to the obligations assumed under the terms of [the] Contract; the Ecuadorian State and Petroecuador likewise assume full responsibility for their contractual obligations.\"\n\nAccording to Perenco, \"[a] plain reading of this clause leads to the unavoidable conclusion that the Contractor should expect to have mutual contractual obligations with both the Ecuadorian State *and* Petroecuador.\"122\n\nCCM \u00b6 92.\n\n176.\n\nSecond, many other provisions of the Contracts spell out particular rights and obligations for Petroecuador, with some provisions requiring Petroecuador and the Contractor to act together in relation to the State. In a section entitled \"Petroecuador's obligations,\" the Contracts itemize specific obligations of Petroecuador, including the requirement to enter into \"any additional and modifying contracts provided for in the law on Hydrocarbons, the Bid Documents and this present Contract;\" to take \"any actions that are necessary, in coordination with the Contractor. to transport the hydrocarbons produced in the Contract Area;\" and to protect the Contractor's interests by \"[n]otify[ing] the Contractor of the receipt of any claim or legal action which could have an impact on the rights of the Contractor\" and \"[p]rovid[ing] reasonable security conditions required to complete the operations described in [the] Contract.\" According to Perenco, these obligations would be meaningless if the Contract could not demand performance of them by Petroecuador.\n\n177.\n\nThird, the Contracts themselves provide evidence that Petroecuador is to be considered a party for disputes concerning the Contracts. In Clause 20.2.1 of the Block 7 Contract, Petroecuador waives its ordinary jurisdiction in favour of arbitration before the Arbitration Center of the Quito Chamber of Commerce. Clause 20.2.20 of the Block 21 Contract provides that in the event that Ecuador or Petroecuador enter into an international agreement providing for arbitration, they shall abide by it. Petroecuador's obligations under these provisions \"would be meaningless if it were not intended to be a party to such an arbitration.\"123 Furthermore, Paragraph 4 of Annex XVI of the Block 21 Contract contemplates the possibility of Petroecuador's designation to ICSID. Perenco asserts that \"it's impossible to see how the respondents can claim on the one hand that it is perfectly clear that Petroecuador was never a party to the contracts, and was not bound by the arbitration agreement under those contracts, and on the other hand maintain that it is also perfectly clear that the parties in paragraph 4 [of Annex XVI] recorded an understanding that Petroecuador necessarily, as a party to the Contract, was still to be designated under Article 25(1).\"124\n\nCCM \u00b6 97.\n\nTr. Day 1, 200: 11.\n\n178.\n\nFinally, the phrase \"through Petroecuador\" as it is used in the Contracts does not relieve Petroecuador of its contractual obligations and party status. First, simply using the preposition \"through\" is not enough to establish an agency relationship. Rather, the term reflects \"a delegation of certain State prerogatives to Petroecuador, which is charged with carrying them out in its own name and under its responsibility.\"125 Second, there is no reason that Petroecuador cannot be considered as *both* a representative of the State and a party to the Contracts. It fulfils both of these roles because it carries out state policy and state activities, but does so in its own name and for its own account. Law 45 confirms this by both making Petroecuador a depository of the exclusive rights upon the Ecuadorian state and providing Petroecuador with its own juridical personality.\n\nCCM \u00b6 117.\n\n***Petroecuador's course of conduct with respect to the Block 7 and 21 Contracts demonstrates its status as a party***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nPerenco asserts that from the time of the Contracts' negotiations, Petroecuador has conducted itself as a party to the Block 7 and Block 21 Contracts. Petroecuador played a central role in the negotiations of both Contracts, which were held between the Consortium of contractors on one side and Petroecuador's negotiating team on the other.\n\n180.\n\nPetroecuador has also made and received performance concerning other economic and commercial aspects of the Contracts. Petroecuador calculated the crude production according to the Contracts' participation percentages, made monthly fiscalization and liquidation reports, and received the State's percentage of the oil production directly from Perenco. In addition, Petroecuador has authorized the returns of bonds as specified under the Contracts, has consented to the disclosure of confidential information concerning the Contracts, and received Perenco's invocation of force majeure in 2006, as required by the Contracts. Finally, since the passage of Law 42, \"Petroecuador has employed its independent juridical personality to issue the *coactiva* notices that became the basis for seizing Perenco's crude in defiance of the Tribunal's provision measures order.\"126\n\nCCM \u00b6 112.\n\n181.\n\nPetroecuador has acted like a party with respect to arbitrations concerning other participation contracts. In *Repsol*, Petroecuador was the sole respondent in a contract dispute arising from another block contract. Far from objecting to the tribunal's jurisdiction, Petroecuador \"exploited the full benefits of the ICSID Convention by bringing an annulment proceeding after an award was issued in Repsol's favour.\"127 Similarly, in the *Occidental I* arbitration, which concerned a contract that had identical \"por intermedio\" language, Ecuador did not contest Petroecuador's status as a party to the contract. Professor Aguilar, who submitted an expert report for the *Occidental* proceedings, concluded in that report that \"[i]n accordance with the HCL, these contracts [participation contracts] are executed by the state company [Petroecuador]. \"Consequently this company [Petroecuador] and the private contractor are the contracting parties.\"128 Ecuador has also not objected to the inclusion of other Ecuadorian agencies with similar rights and responsibilities as Petroecuador in other ICSID proceedings. In the *Noble Energy Inc. and Machala Power*129 case, Ecuador did not object to the inclusion of the agency CONELEC, an agency with very similar rights and responsibilities to Petroecuador. Notably, Ecuador did not argue that Consejo Nacional de Electricidad (CONELEC) was merely a representative of the State on the contract in dispute.\n\nCCM \u00b6 125.\n\nTr. Day 2, 118:16.\n\n*Noble Energy Inc. and MachalaPower C\u00eda. Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/12, Decision on Jurisdiction of March 5, 2008.\n\n(iii) Analysis of the Tribunal\n------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the issue whether Petroecuador is a party to the Contracts before deciding on the effect of the lack of valid claims against Petroecuador.\n\n**The wording of the Participation Contracts defining the Parties to the Contracts**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nClauses 3.3.22 and 3.3.25 of the Participation Contracts for Block 7 & Block 21 define the \" *Parties* \" to the Contracts as \" *the Ecuadorian State, through Petroecuador, and the Contractor.* \"\n\n184.\n\nThe wording makes clear that three entities were involved in the performance of the Contracts. However, the issue is whether these three entities are all independent parties to the Contracts.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the use of the commas combined with the conjunctive \" *and* \" suggests that the Contracts were entered into only by two parties.\n\n186.\n\nFurthermore, the use of the word \" *through* \", which is the English translation of the original Spanish wording \" *por intermedio de* \" used in the Contracts, also suggests that one of the entities, i.e. the Ecuadorian State, was represented by another entity, i.e. Petroecuador.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal is confident that Perenco, Ecuador and Petroecuador all understood that the sentence \" *through Petroecuador* \" was intended to create an agency or representative relationship between Ecuador and Petroecuador. Such explanation becomes undisputable in light of Clause 3.3.32 of the Participation Contract for Block 21 which specifies that \" *PETROECUADOR* \" *\"represents the Ecuadorian State.\"*\n\n188.\n\nAbsent express or unequivocal reference to the contrary, an agent or representative cannot be regarded as an independent party to a contract. Therefore, unless it is proven that Petroecuador could act independently from Ecuador's instruction, on its own initiative and for its own benefit, Petroecuador cannot be considered a party to the Participation Contracts.\n\n189.\n\nNevertheless, the Claimant contends that the circumstances demonstrate that, in parallel to its mission as agent, Petroecuador also acted as an independent party to the Participation Contracts.\n\n**Petroecuador's participation in the contractual negotiations**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Petroecuador's participation in the negotiation of the Contracts is evidence that Petroecuador is a party to the Contracts. The Respondents deny Petroecuador's involvement in the negotiations of the Contracts in any other capacity than as a representative of the Ecuadorian State.\n\n191.\n\nWhether or not the Claimant is right in characterising Petroecuador as a participant in the negotiations in its own capacity, the issue is whether such involvement is sufficient to conclude that Petroecuador acted as an independent party.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that a State can legitimately choose to conduct the negotiation of a contract, to which it will become a party, through its State ministries or through another representative. A State's decision to negotiate the Participation Contracts through an agent is particularly expedient when the same agent is also in charge of the performance of the contracts.\n\n193.\n\nIn the present case, since Petroecuador was to perform the Participation Contracts on behalf of and for the benefit of Ecuador, it made sense for Petroecuador also to participate and represent Ecuador during the negotiation of the Contracts.\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimant nevertheless seems to suggest that Petroecuador was not representing Ecuador when it participated in the negotiation of the Contracts. However, the Claimant did not produce evidence that Petroecuador acted outside of its mission as a representative of the State or decided to take part in the negotiation on its own initiative and for its own benefit.\n\n195.\n\nEven if the Claimant had produced evidence that Petroecuador was involved in the negotiation of the Contracts as an independent entity, such involvement would in itself be insufficient to conclude that Petroecuador is a party to the Contracts. Petroecuador could have negotiated the Contracts independently with the purpose of becoming a party, but in the end, Perenco and Ecuador have chosen another route with Petroecuador being simply an agent of Ecuador.\n\n196.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that such state of affairs, i.e. Petroecuador's participation in the negotiation of the Contracts, could eventually be an element leading toward the conclusion that Petroecuador was a party to the Contracts; however, such element would need to be corroborated by further evidence. As the Tribunal will now conclude, this was not the case.\n\n**Petroecuador's distinct juridical personality**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Petroecuador's distinct juridical personality from Ecuador is further evidence that Petroecuador was considered an independent party to the Participation Contracts. The Claimant's expert asserts that Petroecuador was created by the State with a juridical personality and its own patrimony, to be a depository of the exclusive rights conferred by law upon the Ecuadorian State.130 The Claimant argues that such juridical autonomy is not consistent with a role confined merely to that of an agent.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose of 15 September 2009 \u00b6\u00b6 36- 35.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no basis in the Claimant's reasoning. It is correct to say that an independent party to a contract is necessarily an entity with a juridical personality distinct from the other contract entities. However, it is incorrect to make the opposite assumption, i.e. that an entity is a party to a contract because it has juridical independence. Juridical independence can fulfil other objectives. For instance, and contrary to the Claimant's position, distinct juridical personality is also a prerequisite for an entity to enter an agency relationship as agent of the principal.\n\n199.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the fact that Petroecuador has a juridical personality distinct from Ecuador does not demonstrate that Petroecuador is a party to the Participation Contracts, nor does it prove or deny the agency relationship between Ecuador and Petroecuador. Petroecuador's juridical personality is no more than the evidence of Petroecuador's legal existence.\n\n**Petroecuador's own patrimony and the alleged transfer of State prerogatives**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the fact that Petroecuador was provided with its own patrimony is insufficient evidence that Petroecuador was a party to the Participation Contracts *per se*.\n\n201.\n\nIt is incorrect to assume that an entity involved in the performance of a contract is necessarily a party to the contract because it possesses and uses its own patrimony.\n\n202.\n\nPetroecuador's possession of its own patrimony simply confirms that Petroecuador is a person distinct from Ecuador and has its own assets. However, it does not prove that Petroecuador performs the Participation Contracts as an independent entity for its own benefit.\n\n203.\n\nFurthermore, nothing forbids an agent to utilize its own assets to execute its principal's instructions. Petroecuador could use its own patrimony when performing the Contracts in its position of representative of Ecuador without making it an independent party to the Contracts.\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that Ecuador transferred certain State prerogatives to Petroecuador, and that by doing so, they both intended to make Petroecuador an independent party to the Participation Contracts.\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal finds again that the Claimant is wrong in making such assumption. The Respondents have cautiously submitted that pursuant to the Ecuadorian Constitution oil was the State's \" *inalienable and imprescriptible* \" property, and that therefore Petroecuador intervenes exclusively as a representative of the State in hydrocarbon matters.131 As a result, it is proper to assume that Petroecuador's assets were not transferred to but delegated to Petroecuador. It is quite understandable that an agent which has permission to manage the principal's assets be granted custody of the principal's assets.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade of 17 November 2009 \u00b6\u00b6 82, 85.\n\n206.\n\nIn any event, whether or not Petroecuador's powers were inalienable State prerogatives, no evidence shows that Petroecuador was to carry them out on its own name and for its own benefit.\n\n207.\n\nThe only inference that the Tribunal can draw from the circumstances is that Ecuador intended to provide Petroecuador with some considerable assets and powers to manage Ecuador's oil affairs. However, this does not demonstrate an intention that Petroecuador act as an independent entity and for its own benefit when performing the Contracts.\n\n**Petroecuador's autonomy**\n---------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThis is clearly the best characteristic fitting the Claimant's argument. An independent party to a contract has generally complete autonomy in the conduct of its action when performing a contract. In contrast, a representative is usually constrained by the principal's directions.\n\n209.\n\nHowever, there can be significant variations in the degree of constraint arising out of the principal's instructions. An agent who received precise instructions from the principal can still be granted large powers to execute its mission without being dependent on the principal. In this sense, an agent can enjoy some autonomy so long as it complies with the principal's instructions to manage the principal's affairs. In the Tribunal's view, Petroecuador had to comply with specific instructions since it had to fulfil numerous obligations on behalf of the State. But Petroecuador was also granted significant powers to execute the mission commanded by Ecuador. Such powers had as their objective the giving to Petroecuador of some autonomy in the performance of the Contracts. This does not mean that Petroecuador was acting independently, on its own initiative and for its own benefit. Nothing shows that Petroecuador's autonomy was exercised outside of the representative relationship. Petroecuador had still to comply with Ecuador's instructions and execute the Contracts for Ecuador's benefit.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Petroecuador's obedience to Ecuador's instructions is reflected by Petroecuador's implementation of Law 42. If, as Claimant contends, Petroecuador enjoyed so much autonomy that it made Petroecuador a party to the Contracts, Petroecuador did not have to comply with Law 42 which allegedly modified the Contracts. In the Tribunal's view, Petroecuador's compliance with Ecuador's instruction to implement Law 42 is evidence that Petroecuador never reached the level of autonomy that would make it an independent party to the Contracts.\n\n**Petroecuador's rights and obligations**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nClaimant submits that Petroecuador was a party to the Participation Contracts because Petroecuador assumed various rights and obligations distinct from those of Ecuador.\n\n212.\n\nIn this respect, Claimant emphasizes that Clause 2.10 of the Block 7 Contract provides that\n\n\" *Petroecuador and the contractor have proceeded to negotiate the terms and other conditions of the contractual modification.* \" With the same purpose, Claimant points out Clauses 5.2 of the Block 7 and 21 Contracts which both provide that \" *[i]n addition to the other obligations stipulated in this contract, Petroecuador agrees to*...\" Other clauses such as Clauses 5.4 of the Blocks 7 and 21 Contracts also address the \" *Rights of Petroecuador* \" and the benefits to which \" *Petroecuador shall be entitled to*.\" In Clause 5.6.1 of both Contracts, the contractor assumes full responsibility in respect of Petroecuador and the State regarding obligations assumed under the contract, while the latter two *\"assume full responsibility for their contractual obligations.\"*132\n\nSecond Expert Report of Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose of 15 September 2009 \u00b6 17.\n\n213.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent argues that the \"essential\" obligations and rights derived from the contracts are borne by the contractor and the Ecuadorian State, while the obligations for Petroecuador are \"incidental or secondary\" because they merely concern technical, managerial or executory functions that are related to the primary purposes of the Contracts.133\n\nSecond Expert Report of Luis Sergio Parraguez Ruiz of 17 November 2009 \u00b6\u00b6 28-33.\n\n214.\n\nThe provisions above make clear that the parties intended Petroecuador to have various rights and obligations. However, this does not automatically make Petroecuador a party to the Contracts. None of these provisions provide that Petroecuador is, in the words of the Respondents' expert witness, \"the entity upon whom the legal effect of the transaction fall,\" in terms of liability.134\n\nFirst Expert Report of Luis Sergio Parraguez Ruiz of 3 July 2009 \u00b6 42.\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that these provisions, when read in combination with the sentence \" *Ecuador, through Petroecuador,* \" plainly show that Petroecuador, as an agent, acquires rights and agrees to fulfill the obligations falling upon Ecuador. Since the representative relationship was set out clearly at the beginning of the Contracts, there was no need to repeat in each provision that \" *Ecuador, through Petroecuador, agreed to perform.\" or that \"Ecuador, through Petroecuador, shall be entitled to.\"*\n\n216.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, since Petroecuador was expected to perform the Contracts as an agent of the State, Ecuador and Perenco had to provide Petroecuador with explicit rights and obligations for the specific purpose of conducting business on behalf and for the benefit of Ecuador. This did not affect the representative relationship, provided that the legal consequences of such rights and obligations ultimately affected Ecuador's patrimony.\n\n217.\n\nFor Petroecuador to be considered an independent party to the Participation Contracts, Claimant must have produced clear evidence that Petroecuador assumed rights and obligations for its own benefit or which fell outside of the scope of Ecuador's instructions. The Tribunal was not provided with such evidence.\n\n218.\n\nOn the contrary, the Participation Contracts suggest that Petroecuador assumed distinct rights and obligations pursuant to an agency relationship. For instance, Clauses 5.4.1, with identical wording in both Contracts, provide that Petroecuador is to \" *receive the State's Participation on behalf of the State* \" from the production of crude oil. Such wording is unambiguous. Petroecuador was to administer and supervise contract performance on behalf of the State without receiving any economic benefit.\n\n219.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that Petroecuador undertook some rights and obligations, not in its own interest, but rather as representative of the Ecuadorian State and in furtherance of the State's interests. In this respect, Petroecuador cannot be considered as a party to the Participation Contracts.\n\n**Petroecuador's involvement as a party in other ICSID proceedings**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the fact that Petroecuador acted as a party to similar contracts in other ICSID proceedings is indisputable evidence that Petroecuador is a party to the Participation Contracts. Claimant submits that in *Repsol*, Petroecuador was the sole respondent in a contractual dispute arising out of the participation contract for Block 16. In *Occidental 1*, the Claimant also submits that Ecuador has taken the position that Petroecuador was a party to the Block 15 participation contract.\n\n221.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, whether Petroecuador was a party to similar participation contracts in other cases cannot be considered for the purpose of establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction in the present Arbitration.\n\n222.\n\nIn the *Repsol* and *Occidental I* cases, the arbitrations directed against Petroecuador were based on contract claims. Those contracts, albeit similar to the Participation Contracts, are not the subject of this arbitration which involves different circumstances. The Tribunal does not deem it appropriate to decide whether it has jurisdiction by interpreting other contracts which are not related to this arbitration.\n\n223.\n\nIn other words, whatever position Petroecuador may have taken in other proceedings, this cannot possibly confer jurisdiction on this Tribunal. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that Petroecuador's prior conduct is irrelevant and, in any event, does not indicate an assumption by Petroecuador of obligations as principal which would make it an independent party to the Participation Contracts.\n\n**Claimant's lack of valid claims against Petroecuador**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nAfter careful review of the Memorial on the Merits submitted by Claimant on 10 April 2009, the Tribunal was not able to identify any specific claims against Petroecuador.\n\n225.\n\nAs a recurrent pattern, Claimant articulated claims against \" *the Respondents*.\" Claimant occasionally referred to Petroecuador, however when the claims were formulated towards a specific entity, claims were directed against the State, Ecuador.\n\n226.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the paramount claim made by the Claimant is based on the enactment of Law 42 on 21 April 2006 which modified the State's participation in oil prices revenues. In support of its claim, Claimant also mentioned other various measures taken by Ecuador. For instance, the Claimant referred to:\n\n\u2022 the Government's issuance of Decree 1583 and 1672 on 23 June and 11 July 2006 respectively;\n\n\u2022 the Ministry of Energy and Mines' notification of Perenco dated 6 July 2006 which determined the prices in effect for the purposes of calculating the new participation;\n\n\u2022 the letter from the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum to Perenco dated 23 December 2008 which instructed Perenco to appoint a negotiation team for the reversion of Block 7 and to assign a negotiating team to early termination of Block 21;\n\n\u2022 the Minister's announcement on 21 January 2009 that sought termination of the Participation Contracts;\n\n\u2022 the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum's letter dated 19 March 2009 ordering the preliminary re-liquidation of amounts allegedly being owed under Law 42; and\n\n\u2022 the President's instruction reported on 14 February 2009 which requested that coercive measures be taken against Perenco.\n\n227.\n\nNeither the enactment of Law 42 nor any of the subsequent actions which seem to form the basis of Claimant's claims were acts of Petroecuador. They were actions taken by Ecuador. As an independent entity, Petroecuador is not responsible for acts performed by another entity, i.e. Ecuador.\n\n228.\n\nThe Claimant articulated for the first time a clear claim against Petroecuador at the hearing. The Claimant submitted that \" *Petroecuador violated a number of its obligations under the contracts, including by seizing Perenco's share in production, and refusing to apply a correction factor to the participation formula after the enactment of Law 42.* \"135\n\nTr. Day 1, p. 190:18-23.\n\n229.\n\nTwo factors show that Petroecuador was obliged to implement Law 42. First, as representative of Ecuador, Petroecuador had the legal duty to comply with Ecuador's instructions. Second, as a juridical person of the Ecuadorian State, Petroecuador also had the obligation to comply with applicable State laws. In the Tribunal's view, Petroecuador cannot reasonably be held liable for following Ecuador's instructions and complying with Ecuador's mandatory laws and regulations.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal is comforted in this conclusion because it can see nothing in Claimant's pleadings to suggest that there would be any claim against Petroecuador for acts other than those in connection with Law 42 and associated Decrees and actions, and thus there is no claim that could be brought against Petroecuador in implementing Law 42.\n\n231.\n\nIn the light of all the above, the Tribunal holds that it has no jurisdiction against Petroecuador.\n\n**B. Designation of Petroecuador to ICSID**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nIn light of the conclusion above, there is no need for the Tribunal to consider the Respondents' assertion that Petroecuador has not been designated to ICSID under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**4. Jurisdiction to Enjoin the Respondent's from Applying Law 42**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Position of the Respondents**\n----------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, Perenco requested as part of its prayer for relief that the Tribunal in its award \"[o]rder Ecuador to declare null and void the HCL Amendment as applied to Perenco.\"136 In the Claimant's Memorial, the Tribunal is requested that it enjoin the Respondents from \"collecting any Law 42 assessments they claim are currently due and owing in connection with the Contracts\" and from \"applying Law 42 and its implementing regulations to the Contracts in the future.\"137 The Respondents assert that to the extent Perenco still seeks to obtain an order enjoining Ecuador from enforcing Law 42, they object to this request for the following reasons. First, this Tribunal has no jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention or the Treaty to enjoin Ecuador from applying Law 42. It is a basic principle under international law that tribunals may not set aside national legislation unless this power has been expressly conferred upon them. Instead, tribunals \"can only declare that a domestic legal act is contrary to international law and order the State to render its domestic law in compliance with international law by means of its own choice. \"138 (emphasis added)\n\nRA \u00b6 42(c).\n\nCM \u00b6 170(b) and (c).\n\nFROJ \u00b6 59.\n\n234.\n\nSecond, Perenco's request to be exempted from Law 42 would force Ecuador to impose a discriminatory and unequal treatment towards other companies, which is impermissible under both Ecuadorian and international law. Third, Law 42 was validly enacted and was subsequently declared constitutional by Ecuador's highest constitutional court. Fourth, while Perenco asserts that this Tribunal has already ruled on the availability of injunctive relief in its Provisional Measures Decision, this issue is not in fact *res judicata*. The Tribunal's holding that provisional measures may \"restrain a State from enforcing a law pending final resolution of the dispute on the merits\" was limited to the context of the provisional measures and does not have the effect of permanently enjoining Ecuador from applying Law 42.\n\n**B. Position of the Claimant**\n-------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nPerenco maintains that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to award restitution in the form of an order enjoining Ecuador from applying Law 42 to the Participation Contracts and from enforcing Law 42 levies. First, Perenco is not seeking to wholly invalidate Law 42, but merely to restrain Ecuador from enforcing Law 42 against it. Second, this issue is now *res judicata,* as it was already squarely addressed by the Provisional Measures Decision, which provided that \"[w]hile the enactment of a law by a sovereign State, upheld as constitutional in that State, is a matter of importance, it cannot be conclusive or preclude the Tribunal from exercise of its power to grant provisional measures\" that can \"thus restrain a State from enforcing a law.\"139\n\nPMD \u00b6\u00b6 49-51.\n\n236.\n\nThird, relief in the form of restituting the existing legal regime is preferred under international law. Other tribunals, including the tribunal in *Micula v. Romania*140, have ordered or contemplated measures enjoining the enforcement of domestic laws, even where the applicable BIT did not explicitly permit restitution. While courts may have limited ability to enforce their own judgments, this does not detract from their ability to rule the measures illegal and award restitution.\n\n*Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, S.C. European Food S.A., S.C. Starmill S.R.L. and S.C. Multipack S.R.L. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of September 24, 2008, \u00b6\u00b6166-168.\n\n**C. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that all this debate in which the Parties have engaged is premature. It does not properly belong to the jurisdictional phase of the proceeding, the purpose of which is to determine whether the ICSID has jurisdiction and the Tribunal has competence over the merits of the case brought before it. The jurisdiction of the ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal are based on the consent of the parties to the dispute. The remedies are not. What remedies are available, in case the Tribunal after having previously satisfied itself that it has competence comes to the conclusion that the Respondent has breached its obligations, is an issue of law governed by legal rules applicable to the dispute.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the ICSID Convention contains no specific provision on the remedies which it can order (award). Certainly, it can impose a pecuniary obligation on the Respondent as Article 54 of the Convention implies when it provides that \"[e]ach Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.\" If a treaty, as the BIT141 in the present case, does not provide for specific remedies in case of its breach, it is the general (customary) international law of State Responsibility which comes into play. For a breach of a contractual obligation, the law governing the contract will have to be looked at when determining the appropriate remedy.\n\nThe fair and adequate compensation to be paid to the investors in case of expropriation or nationalization of their investments under Article 6(1) of the BIT is not to be construed as a remedy for an unlawful act but is a primary obligation the fulfilment of which is one of the conditions for any expropriation or nationalization measure to be lawful.\n\n239.\n\nUnder Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal \"shall be the judge of its own competence.\" Once its competence over the merits is established, such competence covers the issue of available remedies as well; as the International Court of Justice observed, \"[i]n general, jurisdiction to determine the merits of a dispute entails jurisdiction to determine reparation.\"142 However, the issue of available remedies is certainly not \"a preliminary question\" in the sense of Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n*Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua, Nicaragua v. United States of America*, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 142, para. 283. The Court also stated in other cases that \"[w]here jurisdiction exists over a dispute on a particular matter, no separate basis for jurisdiction is required by the Court to consider the remedies a party has requested for the breach of the obligation.\" *LaGrand (Germany v. United States of America)*, I.C.J. Reports 2001, p. 466, para. 48; also *Avena and Other Mexican Nationals (Mexico v. United States of America)*, I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 33, para. 34.\n\n240.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal does not consider necessary, nor appropriate, to decide at this stage of the proceeding, what remedies might be available in case it concludes that the Respondent has breached its obligations. The Tribunal simply takes note of the arguments of the Parties, and will revert to the issue of remedies, if and when necessary, taking into account any further views on this point the Parties may offer.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n241.\n\nHaving concluded that the Tribunal has competence over the contract claims of Perenco against the Republic of Ecuador, and having postponed its decision on the competence over the treaty claims, the Tribunal reserves all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and of the Parties for their legal representation for subsequent decision.\n\n**VI. DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides:\n\n1. to defer its decision on its competence over Claimant's Treaty claims to the merits phase of the proceeding;\n\n2. that it has competence *ratione materiae* over the Claimant's contract claims under the Block 7 and Block 21 Participation Contracts;\n\n3. that it has no competence over Petroecuador;\n\n4. that in view of the Tribunal's request for the submission of any relevant *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty in the possession of the other Contracting Party, as well as for further evidence on the issue of the Perrodo heirs' relationship to the Claimant, such material must be submitted prior to the filing of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial so as to allow the Respondent sufficient time to address such material in its pleading. The Parties are directed to jointly approach the responsible French authorities and request the disclosure of any relevant *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty should they exist;\n\n5. that any such *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* shall be filed no later than August 1, 2011;\n\n6. that the Claimant shall file any additional evidence pertaining to the Perrodo heirs' relationship to the Claimant no later than 1 August 2011;\n\n7. that to enable the Tribunal to be in a position to decide all claims should it resolve the remaining objection in the Claimant's favour, the Parties shall address both the merits of the Claimant's contract claims and its Treaty claims in their pleadings."}, {"Title": "Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2014-09-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **FREQUENTLY**  **USED**  **ABBREVIATIONS AND**  **ACRONYMS** | |\n| Amended Request | Amended Request for Arbitration dated 30 April 2008, submitted on 18 July 2008 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| Bill for the Law Reforming the Hydrocarbons Law or Bill | Bill of the Law Amending the Hydrocarbons Law presented by the President of the Republic of Ecuador to the President of Congress, 1 March 2006 |\n| BIT or the Treaty | Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Republic of Ecuador on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments |\n| Block 7 Participation Contract or Block 7 Contract | Contract Modifying the Service Contract to a Participation for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 7 of the Amazon Region, including the Contract for the Coca-Payamino Unified Field |\n| Block 21 Participation Contract or Block 21 Contract | Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon Region |\n| Burlington | Burlington Resources Inc. |\n| CEL | *Comit\u00e9 Especial de Licitaciones* or Petroecuador's Special Bidding Commission |\n| CEPE | *Corporaci\u00f3n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana* |\n| CLAPSA | Compa\u00f1\u00eda Latinoamericana Petrolera Sociedad An\u00f3nima |\n| Counter-Memorial | Ecuador's Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims dated 5 December 2011 |\n| Decision on Jurisdiction | Decision on Jurisdiction dated 30 June 2011 |\n| Decision on Provisional Measures | Decision on Provisional Measures dated 8 May 2009 |\n| Ecuador | Republic of Ecuador |\n| First Implementing Regulation | Decree No. 1672 Implementing Law 42-2006 of 13 July 2006 |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 18 March 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| Law 42 or the HCL Amendment | Law No. 2006-42 Amending the Hydrocarbons Law |\n| Law 44 | Law 44 Amending the Hydrocarbons Law, Official Registry No. 326 of 29 November 1993 |\n| LET | *Ley de Equidad Tributaria* of 29 December 2007 |\n| Memorial on the Merits | Claimant's Memorial dated 10 April 2009 |\n| OCP | *Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados* |\n| Oryx | Oryx Ecuador Energy Company |\n| Perenco or PEL | Perenco Ecuador Limited |\n| Petroecuador | *Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador* |\n| PIL | Perenco International Limited |\n| Preussag | Preussag Energie GMBH PBP |\n| Rejoinder | Ecuador's Rejoinder on Liability dated 27 July 2012 |\n| Request | Request for Arbitration dated 30 April 2008 |\n| Reply | Claimant's Reply to Respondent's CounterMemorial dated 12 April 2012 |\n| Revised Memorial | Claimant's Revised Memorial dated 5 August 2011 |\n| Santa Fe | Santa Fe Minerales del Ecuador Sociedad An\u00f3nima |\n| Second Implementing Regulation | Decree No. 662 Implementing Law 42-2006 of 4 October 2007 |\n| SIPETROL | Sociedad Internacional Petrolera Sociedad An\u00f3nima |\n| The Parties | Collectively the Claimant and Respondent |\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant, Perenco Ecuador Limited, is a company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The Claimant avers that at the material time, namely on 17 October 2007, when consent to the arbitration of this dispute was given, it was controlled by French nationals and hence the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Treaty claim brought by Perenco.1 The Claimant has also advanced claims of breach of the Participation Contracts relating to Blocks 7 and 21. The Claimant is hereinafter referred to as **\"Perenco\"** or \" **the Claimant**.\"\n\nAmended Request for Arbitration dated 30 April 2008, paragraph 14 (\" **Amended Request** \"). For a further description of the facts relating to this aspect of the Claimant's claim, see below at section III.A.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Ecuador and is hereinafter referred to as \" **Ecuador** \" or \" **the Respondent**.\"\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as **\"the Parties.\"** The Parties' respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**B. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n4.\n\nThis proceeding concerns alleged breaches by Ecuador of the obligations under the Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Republic of Ecuador on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (\" **the Treaty** \" or the \" **BIT** \") and two \"Participation Contracts\" (also known as \"production sharing contracts\") concluded by the Claimant and Petroecuador, the latter acting on the State's behalf, relating to the exploration and exploitation of Blocks 7 and 21 situated in the Ecuadorian Amazon region.\n\n5.\n\nThe Participation Contracts are, first, the Contract Modifying the Service Contract to a Participation for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 7 of the Amazon Region, including the Contract for the Coca-Payamino Unified Field (\" **the Block 7** **Participation Contract** \" or **\"the Block 7 Contract\"**)2, and second, the Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon Region (**\"the**  **Block 21 Participation Contract\"** or **\"the Block 21 Contract\"**),3 (together, the two contracts will be referred as **\"the Participation Contracts\"** or **\"the Contracts\"**). Perenco also entered into Joint Operating Agreements with other entities holding interests in Blocks 7 and 21.4 These agreements, and the Parties' respective rights and obligations under the Contracts will be described in further detail below.\n\nExhibit CE-17, Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons for Block 7 of the Amazon Region, 23 March 2000 (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12) (\"Block 7 Participation Contract\").\n\nExhibit CE-10, Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block 21 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region, 20 March 1995 (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12) (\"Block 21 Participation Contract\").\n\nExhibits CE-31, Novation of Joint Operating Agreement in respect of Block 7, Oriente Basin, Ecuador, 12 December 2002, and CE-32, Novation of Joint Operating Agreement in respect of Block 21, Oriente Basin, Ecuador, 12 December 2002.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 30 April 2008, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**\"ICSID\"** or **\"Centre\"**) received a request for arbitration (**\"the Request\"**) from Perenco against the Republic of Ecuador and *Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador* (\" **Petroecuador** \"). Perenco's Request was brought to ICSID on the basis of Article 9 of the Treaty and the arbitration clauses contained in the Participation Contracts.\n\n7.\n\nOn 4 June 2008, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (**\"ICSID Convention\"**).\n\n8.\n\nOn 28 July 2008, the Claimant filed an amended request for arbitration (\" **the Amended Request** \").\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal was initially constituted on 21 November 2008 as follows: Thomas Bingham, a national of the United Kingdom, appointed as President by the party-appointed arbitrators, after consultation with the parties; Charles N. Brower, a national of the United States, appointed by the Claimant; and J. Christopher Thomas QC, a national of Canada, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n10.\n\nOn 7 February 2009, the Tribunal held a First Session with the Parties in Washington, DC. The agreements of the Parties were embodied in Minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal and circulated to the Parties.\n\n11.\n\nOn 9 February 2009, the Tribunal fixed the procedural calendar.\n\n12.\n\nOn 19 February 2009, Perenco filed a request for provisional measures.\n\n13.\n\nOn 20 February 2009, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimant's request for provisional measures.\n\n14.\n\nOn 21 February 2009, the Claimant filed a response to the Respondent's observations on the request for provisional measures.\n\n15.\n\nOn 26 February 2009, the Respondent filed further observations on the request for provisional measures.\n\n16.\n\nOn 27 February 2009, the Claimant filed a reply on provisional measures.\n\n17.\n\nOn 6 March 2009, the Respondent filed a rejoinder on provisional measures.\n\n18.\n\nOn 9 March 2009, the Claimant filed further observations on provisional measures.\n\n19.\n\nA hearing on provisional measures was held in Paris, France, on 19 March 2009.\n\n20.\n\nOn 10 April 2009, Perenco filed its Memorial on the Merits (\" **the Memorial**\"). It was accompanied by the witness statements of Mr. Eric D'Argentr\u00e9, Mr. Laurent Combe, and Mr. Patrick Spink, as well as by the first expert report of Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose.\n\n21.\n\nOn 8 May 2009, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional Measures (\" **the Decision on** **Provisional Measures** \") holding that:\n\n79.... circumstances require it to recommend, and it does recommend, provisional measures restraining the Respondents from:\n\n(1) demanding that Perenco pay any amounts allegedly due pursuant to Law 42;\n\n(2) instituting or further pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, including the actions described in the notices dated 19 February and 3 March 2009, to collect from Perenco any payments Respondents claim are owed by Perenco or the Consortium pursuant to Law 42;\n\n(3) instituting or pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, against Perenco or any of its officers or employees, arising from or in connection with the Participation Contracts; and\n\n(4) unilaterally amending, rescinding, terminating, or repudiating the Participation Contracts or engaging in any other conduct which may directly or indirectly affect or alter the legal situation under the Participation Contracts, as agreed upon by the parties.5\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, paragraph 79.\n\n22.\n\nOn 17 July 2009, Ecuador and Petroecuador filed, in separate submissions, Objections to Jurisdiction. Ecuador's Objections were accompanied by the witness statement of Dr. Christian D\u00e1valos and the first expert reports of Professors Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, Luis Parraguez Ruiz and Hern\u00e1n Salgado Pesantes. The Respondent made a formal application under Article 41(2) of the Convention that its jurisdictional objections be dealt with as a preliminary question.\n\n23.\n\nOn 17 September 2009, Perenco filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. It was accompanied by the witness statement of Mr. Andrew Derman and the second expert report of Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose.\n\n24.\n\nEcuador and Petroecuador jointly filed a Reply on Jurisdiction on 17 November 2009, to which they attached the second expert reports of Professors Aguilar and Parraguez.\n\n25.\n\nOn 16 December 2009, following the resignation of Judge Brower, the Secretary-General notified the Parties of the vacancy on the Tribunal and suspended the proceedings pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\" **the Arbitration Rules** \").\n\n26.\n\nOn 13 January 2010, the Claimant appointed Mr. Neil Kaplan CBE, QC, SBS, a national of the United Kingdom, and the Tribunal was reconstituted.\n\n27.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, Perenco filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, to which it attached the third expert report of Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose.\n\n28.\n\nOn 17 February 2010, following the resignation of Lord Bingham, the proceedings were suspended again.\n\n29.\n\nThe Parties were unable to agree on a third arbitrator to serve as the President of the Tribunal and consequently invoked Article 38 of the ICSID Convention to request that the Chairman of the Administrative Council designate the President of the Tribunal. The Chairman designated Judge Peter Tomka, a national of Slovakia, to sit as President, and the Tribunal was reconstituted on 6 May 2010.\n\n30.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction was held in The Hague, Netherlands, from 2 to 4 November 2010.

THE FACTS**\n------------------\n\n43.\n\nAs noted above, the dispute between the Parties concerns the Block 7 and Block 21 Participation Contracts. Perenco was the sole operator and majority holder of Participation Contract rights in both Blocks, holding a 53.75% interest in Block 21 and a 57.5% interest in Block 7. The remaining interest in both Blocks was held by Burlington Resources Oriente Limited (**\"Burlington Oriente\"**), with which Perenco has formed a Consortium.\n\n44.\n\nThe following sections present a summary of facts of this dispute relevant to the Tribunal's findings.\n\n**A. Ownership and Control of the Claimant**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nBefore turning to address the chain of events that led to the initiation of this arbitration, it is necessary to summarise the facts insofar as they relate to the Respondent's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over Perenco's Treaty claim. Submissions on the objection, and the evidence of witnesses tendered by the Parties in relation thereto, are addressed further below at sections IV.A.(1), and VII.\n\n46.\n\nPerenco is part of the Perenco Group of Companies founded by a French national, the late Mr. Hubert Perrodo, in 1975. Among other things, it is engaged in the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon resources.\n\n47.\n\nPerenco was incorporated in the Bahamas in November 2001 to hold the Perenco Group's investments in Ecuador.\n\n48.\n\nFrom the time that Mr. Hubert Perrodo took Perenco private in 19957 until his demise on 29 December 2006 as a result of a climbing accident in France, he controlled the Perenco Group of Companies.8\n\nReply, paragraph 12.\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraphs 3-7.\n\n49.\n\nAt the time of Mr. Perrodo's death, on 29 December 2006, Perenco was part of the following corporate structure:9\n\na) Its sole shareholder was Perenco Gabon S.A (formerly Perenco S.A), also incorporated in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\n\nb) Perenco Gabon S.A, in turn, was wholly owned by Perenco S.A. (formerly Perenco Oil and Gas), also incorporated in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\n\nc) Perenco S.A was wholly owned by Perenco International Limited (\" **PIL** \"), also incorporated in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\n\nd) 92.9% of the registered shares of PIL were owned by Mr. Hubert Perrodo and the remaining 7.1% of the shares were owned by another Bahamian company, Glenmor Energy Limited, whose sole shareholder was Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, Mr. Hubert Perrodo's eldest son. Mr. Hubert Perrodo gifted 7.1% of the shares in PIL to his son in 2004.10\n\nExhibit E-1, Letter from Debevoise & Plimpton to Dechert dated 8 July 2009 enclosing letter from Debevoise & Plimpton to ICSID dated 28 May 2008, with attached Organizational Chart.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 11; 2nd Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 2.\n\n50.\n\nMr. Hubert Perrodo died intestate. Under French law, upon the death of an intestate, the entirety of his estate vests automatically in his heirs.11 The evidence is that Mr. Perrodo's 92.9% shareholding in PIL formed part of his estate and thus ownership of that shareholding also vested automatically in his heirs, namely, his widow, Ka Yee Perrodo, and his three children, Fran\u00e7ois, Nathalie and Bertrand (subject to a further issue of determining the heirs' respective entitlements, a matter discussed further below).12\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 3.\n\n*Ibid.* ; Exhibit CE-220, Material subject to the Confidentiality Order issued by the Tribunal, paragraphs 2-5; see also, 1st Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 12.\n\n51.\n\nUnder Bahamian law, where an intestate had property sited in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, it is necessary for there to be a grant of the estate to an administrator pursuant to Letters of Administration. The heirs instructed Bahamian counsel, Ms. Heather Thompson, to make an application for Letters of Administration on 16 April 2009 in respect of the estate.13 Letters were duly granted on 19 August 2009.14\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 38.\n\n*Ibid.* ; Exhibit CE-240, Letters of Administration in the Estate of Hubert Firmin Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, in the Supreme Court of the Bahamas Probate Side, 19 August 2009 (also attached to the Expert Report of Bernard Reynis as Exhibit 2).\n\n52.\n\nThe delay between the time of Mr. Hubert Perrodo's death and the application and grant for Letters of Administration appears to be due to a dispute between Ka Yee Perrodo and her children, as evidenced by the fact that on 15 February 2008, Mrs. Perrodo lodged a caveat in the Supreme Court of the Bahamas preventing any grant of Letters of Administration from being made in respect of the estate of Hubert Perrodo.15 Mrs. Perrodo later withdrew the Caveat on 30 March 2009 and the application for Letters of Administration was made shortly thereafter.16 It was only on 22 December 2011 that the heirs of Hubert Perrodo were registered as shareholders of PIL (the ultimate parent company of Perenco).17\n\nExhibit E-72, Caveat filed in the Supreme Court of the Bahamas by Carrie Perrodo in the Estate of Hubert Perrodo, dated 15 February 2008; see also, Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, pp 420-422 (Testimony of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo).\n\nExhibit E-73, Notice of Withdrawal filed in the Supreme Court of The Bahamas by Carrie Perrodo in the Estate of Hubert Perrodo dated 30 March 2009.\n\nExhibit CE-294, Email correspondence between Roland Fox and Heather Thompson, enclosing instructions from Perrodo heirs, 22 December 2011.\n\n53.\n\nQuite apart from the handling of the estate and the ultimate distribution of the PIL shares to the heirs, steps were also taken by PIL\u2019s Board of Directors shortly after Mr. Perrodo\u2019s death, first to elect his eldest son Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo as a member and Chairman of the Board of Directors of PIL and Perenco S.A. on 12 January 200718 and then, on 24 September 2007, to elect Ka Yee Perrodo and Nathalie Perrodo to PIL\u2019s Board of Directors.19\n\nExhibit CE-198, Board of Directors Meeting Minutes of Perenco International Limited, 12 January 2007, PER 03639; see also, 2nd Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 6; Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, p 371 (Testimony of Roland Fox).\n\nExhibit CE-199, Board of Directors Meeting Minutes of Perenco International Limited, 24 September 2007.\n\n**B. Ecuador\u2019s Hydrocarbons Industry**\n--------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThis Section summarises the facts of this dispute relating to the development of Ecuador\u2019s hydrocarbons industry insofar as they are relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s findings.\n\n55.\n\nPrior to 1993, like many other countries, Ecuador had adopted the \u2018service contract\u2019 modality for oil and gas explorations.20 Under a service contract, the contractor, usually an international oil company, provides all the services necessary to explore and develop the State\u2019s oil deposits in return for payment of a fee which is supposed to cover the costs of production incurred as well as a margin of profit.21 The contractor acts solely as a service provider under this model and it is not entitled to any share in any oil that may be produced. In such an arrangement, there may be little commercial incentive for the contractor to seek to exploit an oilfield to its maximum potential, consistent with proper drilling practices.\n\nSee Exhibits CE-1, Service Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons Block 7, Amazon Region, Ecuador, 18 December 1985 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts); CE-5, Law 44 Amending the Hydrocarbons Law, Official Registry No. 326 of 29 November 1993 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts as revised on 11-01-12) (\"Law 44\").\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, pp 37-38 (Opening Statement of Mr Mark Friedman).\n\n56.\n\nThis arrangement thus had its disadvantages, both for Ecuador and for the oil companies operating in the country. When oil prices were low, as was the case during the 1980s and 90s, Ecuador ran the risk that the service fees generated by the contractor would exceed the revenue it received from oil sales and consequently, it would incur losses, especially when it had little control over the costs incurred by the contractor and the contractor had little incentive to keep such costs down.22 Further, due to the fee structure of the service contracts, the oil companies had little incentive to enter into such contracts because of the absence of any \"upside\" potential.23 They therefore lacked any commercial motivation to fully exploit the oil and gas resources of Ecuador in accordance with the State\u2019s overall development goals. This is evidenced by the fact that from 1988 to 1993, no service contracts were signed in Ecuador.24\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 13-15.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nExhibit CE-4, Law 44 Legislative Debates of 17-18 November 1993 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts), PER 00481 (\"Law 44 Legislative Debates\").\n\n57.\n\nEcuador thus resolved to revamp its existing hydrocarbons law to make investment in its hydrocarbons industry more attractive.25 On 29 November 1993, Ecuador passed Law 44 to amend its existing Hydrocarbons Law to recognise \"participation contracts\" as the preferred contractual model for the exploration and exploitation of its hydrocarbon resources.26 The explanatory memoranda accompanying Law 44 reasoned that the risks involved in exploration and exploitation of its hydrocarbon resources needed to be shared with international oil companies due to the scarce resources that Ecuador could commit to such ventures, and that \"the Services Contract does not allow the contracting company to own a production flow\", \"[t]his characteristic denaturing] the interest and purpose of international oil companies, for the majority of which the availability of production for selling oil in international markets is an essential item.\"27\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nExhibit CE-5, Law 44.\n\nExhibit CE-303, Official Communication No. 93-225, Quito, 29 October 1993, p 4.\n\n58.\n\nAs was the case for service contracts under the law of Ecuador, under production sharing contracts the ownership of the hydrocarbon resources remained with the State. However, the form of remuneration to the contractor is based upon a production-sharing modality, requiring the contractor to fund all costs of exploration and exploitation of the hydrocarbons in exchange for a share of the oil produced, the proportion of which would depend on allocation formulas set out in each contract.28 The evidence is that most oil companies, including Perenco, prefer participation contracts even though there is no guarantee that their costs will be covered, because there is a greater potential reward, particularly when oil prices rise.29\n\n1st Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraph 10.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraph 11.\n\n59.\n\nLaw 44 defined participation contracts as follows:\n\n[C]ontracts executed by the State, by means of Petroecuador, whereby the contractor is delegated with...the right to explore and exploit hydrocarbons in the contract\u2019s area, making at its own account and risk all investments, cost and expenses necessary for the exploration, development and exploitation.\n\nThe contractor...will have the right to a participation in the production from the contract\u2019s area, which will be calculated on the basis of the percentages offered and agreed therein, in relation with the volume of hydrocarbons produced. This participation, valued at the sales price of hydrocarbons from the contract area, which in no case shall be less than the reference price, will be the contractor\u2019s gross income, from which the contractor will make deductions and pay income tax, in accordance with the rules set in the Internal Tax Regime Law.30\n\nExhibit CE-5, Law 44, Article 4.\n\n60.\n\nApart from amending the Hydrocarbons Law, Ecuador also took other steps to create a legal and regulatory environment conducive to attracting further foreign investment in the hydrocarbons and other sectors. For example, in 1997, Ecuador enacted Law 46 on \"the Law on Promotion and Guarantee of Investments\", the stated objective of which was to \"promote national and foreign investment and regulate the rights and obligations of the investors so that they may effectively contribute to the economic and social development of the country.\"31 Other measures included amendments to its Constitution which guaranteed that foreign investment should be afforded the same rights and treatment as national investment,32 the enactment of privatisation laws in 2000 which allowed investors to acquire up to 51% of the shares in electric and telecommunications businesses,33 as well as measures to replace the then-Ecuadorian currency, the *sucre,* with the US dollar.34\n\nExhibit CE-13, Law 46 on Promotion and Guarantee of Investments, Official Registry 219 of 19 December 1997 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts as revised on 11-01-12), PER 00741.\n\nExhibit CE-22, Country Commerce: Ecuador, The Economist Intelligence Unit, December 2001, PER 01358.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n61.\n\nThe Government also sought to facilitate the financing and construction of a new pipeline, the *Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados* or **\"OCP\".35** In February 2001, the Government and a seven-company consortium concluded a US$ 1.1 billion agreement to construct the OCP.36 The OCP made it possible for significant quantities of Ecuador\u2019s oil reserves hitherto located in remote areas of the Amazon to be produced and shipped in a commercially viable manner.37\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 22.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraphs 14 -15\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**C. Perenco\u2019s interests in the Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nBlocks 7 and 21 are located in the Ecuadorian Amazonian Region and each covers an area of approximately 200,000 hectares.\n\n63.\n\nIn January 1994, shortly after the enactment of Law 44, Petroecuador\u2019s Special Bidding Commission (known in Spanish as the *Comit\u00e9 Especial de Licitaciones* **(\"CEL\"))** announced the 7th International Bidding Round for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons for Block 21, a block that had not been previously exploited.38\n\nWitness Statement of Andrew B. Derman, paragraph 5.\n\n64.\n\nOn 15 March 1995, the CEL awarded the Exploration and Exploitation of Block 21 to a group of companies, namely, Oryx Ecuador Energy Company **(\"Oryx\"),** Santa Fe Minerales del Ecuador Sociedad An\u00f3nima **(\"Santa Fe\"),** Sociedad Internacional Petrolera Sociedad An\u00f3nima **(\"SIPETROL\")** and Compa\u00f1\u00eda Latinoamericana Petrolera Sociedad An\u00f3nima **(\"CLAPSA\").39** The Participation Contract between Petroecuador and these companies was signed on 20 March 1995.40 Shortly after, in June 1995, Santa Fe transferred its rights and obligations in the Block 21 Participation Contract to Preussag Energie GMBH PBP **(\"Preussag\").41** In June 1999, Kerr McGee Ecuador Energy Corporation acquired Oryx, including its interest in Block 21.42\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nExhibit CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract.\n\nExhibit CE-23, Decree 343 from the Ministry of Energy and Mines approving the transfer of Kerr-McGee\u2019s interest in the Participation Contract for Block 21 to Perenco and Burlington, 9 May 2002 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts).\n\nExhibit CE-23, Decree 323 from the Ministry of Energy and Mines approving the transfer of Kerr-McGee\u2019s interest in the Participation Contract for Block 21 to Perenco and Burlington, 9 May 2002 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts).\n\n65.\n\nUnlike Block 21, Block 7 was originally operated pursuant to a Service Contract concluded in 1985 between British Petroleum **(\"BP\")** and the state-owned enterprise *Corporaci\u00f3n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana* **(\"CEPE\")** (Petroecuador\u2019s predecessor).43\n\nExhibit CE-1, Service Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons Block 7, Amazon Region, Ecuador, 18 December 1985 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts).\n\n66.\n\nIn 1990, BP assigned the Block 7 Service Contract to Oryx.44 It was only in 1999 (some six years after Law 44 contemplated the transformation of Service Contracts into Participation Contracts) that Petroecuador began discussions on the transition of the Block 7 Services Contract to a Participation Contract.45 On 10 March 2000, shortly after Kerr McGee acquired Oryx, the CEL approved the Block 7 Services Contract\u2019s migration to a Participation Contract between Petroecuador and the same consortium that by that time held interests in Block 21, namely, Kerr McGee, Preussag, SIPETROL and CLAPSA II.46 On 23 March 2000, the Participation Contract for Block 7 was signed between Petroecuador and Kerr McGee, Preussag and SIPETROL and CLAPSA II.47\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 709.\n\nExhibit CE-257, Negotiation Commission to Change the Block 7 Contract, Report on Negotiation Results, 3 November 1999 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\nExhibit CE-16, Resolution No. 620-CEL-2000 of the Special Bidding Commission of Petroecuador approving the execution of the Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons for Block 7 of the Amazon Region, 10 March 2000 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts), PER 00791.\n\nExhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract.\n\n67.\n\nIn August 2001, Perenco\u2019s Vice President of Business Development, Mr. Patrick Spink, was contacted by the Business Development Manager of Burlington Resources Inc. **(\"Burlington\").** Burlington\u2019s subsidiary, Burlington Oriente, was in discussions to acquire Kerr McGee\u2019s interests in Blocks 7 and 21. According to Mr. Spink, Burlington originally intended to purchase all of Kerr McGee\u2019s interests in Blocks 7 and 21 but had decided not to proceed with the full purchase due to a major acquisition it had made in Canada.48 Burlington still wished to proceed with the purchase of 5% of Kerr McGee\u2019s interest and suggested that Perenco purchase the remaining interest.49\n\n1st Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraph 4.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n68.\n\nAccording to Mr. Spink, from Perenco\u2019s perspective, this opportunity was potentially lucrative because it provided the Perenco Group with the possibility of acquiring a combination of a mature asset (Block 7), that is, an asset which already had infrastructure and which was already producing oil, as well as a greenfield development project (Block 21), which had not been developed at all. While the Perenco Group had operated only mature fields, and had minimal experience with greenfield developments in Colombia and West Africa, it was looking for other suitable development opportunities. Purchasing Kerr McGee\u2019s interests in Blocks 7 and 21 would allow Perenco to generate income from Block 7 while it incurred costs in developing a greenfield block in a remote area where the oil was believed to be of poorer quality.50\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 5; see also, Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, p 441 (Testimony of Patrick Spink).\n\n69.\n\nAccording to the evidence of the Claimant, having regard to these factors, along with Perenco\u2019s perception of the favourable investment environment in Ecuador at the time, Perenco purchased 45% of Kerr McGee\u2019s interest in Blocks 7 and 21 for a purchase price of US $79 million in or around December 2001.51\n\n1st Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraph 6.\n\n70.\n\nOn 2 September 2002, after the requisite government approval had been obtained,52 Kerr McGee assigned its interests in the Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21 to Perenco.53 The ownership interests in the Blocks at this time were as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Block 7** | **Block 21** |\n| Perenco | 45% | 45% |\n| Burlington | 30% | 37.5 % |\n| Preussag | 25% | 17.5 % |\n\nExhibits CE-24, Decree 342 from the Ministry of Energy and Mines approving the transfer of Kerr-McGee\u2019s interest in the Participation Contract for Block 7 to Perenco and Burlington, 9 May 2002 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts), PER 01413 and CE-25, Performance Guarantee for the Participation Contract for Block 21, issued by Perenco, S.A, 16 May 2002.\n\nExhibits CE-27, Assignment Contract of Kerr-McGee\u2019s interest in the Participation Contract for Block 21 to Perenco and Burlington, 4 September 2002 (in Spanish), and CE-28, Assignment Contract of Kerr-McGee\u2019s interest in the Participation Contract for Block 7 to Perenco and Burlington, 4 September 2002 (in Spanish).\n\n71.\n\nPerenco\u2019s purchase of Kerr McGee\u2019s interests in Blocks 7 and 21 was also accompanied by its purchase of Kerr McGee\u2019s 1,809% equity stake in the Consortium operating the OCP. This included an undertaking of ship-or-pay commitments for Block 21 of 20,000 barrels per day until 2018. If Perenco did not ship these 20,000 barrels a day, it would incur payment obligations for the unused capacity.54\n\n1st Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraph 16.\n\n72.\n\nShortly after acquiring its interests in the Blocks, Perenco entered into two Joint Operating Agreements with Burlington and Preussag whereby Perenco became the Operator of the Joint Operations.55 Perenco\u2019s responsibilities as Operator included the management of joint operations as well as the distribution of profits and administration of joint debts and expenses. In late 2005, to comply with Ecuadorian tax requirements intended to simplify income tax auditing and collection, the three companies entered into a Consortium Agreement, which became effective on 1 January 2006.56\n\nExhibits CE-31, Novation of Joint Operating Agreement in respect of Block 7, Oriente Basin, Ecuador, 12 December 2002, and CE-32, Novation of Joint Operating Agreement in respect of Block 21, Oriente Basin, Ecuador, 12 December 2002.\n\nExhibits CE-47, Consortium Agreement between Preussag International Energie GMBH, Burlington and Perenco, 30 December 2005 (in Spanish with English translation), and CE-44, Addendum to Joint Operation Agreements between Preussag International Energie GMBH, Burlington and Perenco, 6 December 2005.\n\n73.\n\nThree years after acquiring the interests in Blocks 7 and 21 from Kerr McGee, Perenco and Burlington decided to acquire Preussag\u2019s interests in Block 7 and Block 21. On 7 September 2005, the agreement for the purchase was signed and the requisite government approvals were also given.57 Perenco agreed to pay US $23.5 million for interests acquired by it.58 The allocation of interests between Perenco and Burlington were then as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Block 7** | **Block 21** |\n| Perenco | 57.5 % | 53.75 % |\n| Burlington | 42.5 % | 46.25 % |\n\nExhibit CE-38, Sale and Purchase Agreement between Preussag International Energie GMBH, Burlington and Perenco, for Blocks 21 and 7, 7 September 2005; 1st Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraphs 21-22.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n74.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Perenco agreed to purchase a small additional equity interest in the OCP, which thereafter stood at 2.1608%.59\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n75.\n\nThe Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21 were set to expire in 2010 and 2021, respectively. The two Contracts differ in certain terms, but they generally follow the same scheme. In essence, they granted Perenco the right to, \"carry out, on its own account and risk, the activities for Crude Oil exploitation and additional exploration in the Contract Area, investing the capital and using the necessary personnel, equipment, machinery and technology for full performance, in exchange for which the Contractor shall receive, as a participation, a percentage of the Measured Production.\"60\n\nExhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, clause 4.2 (PER 04758).\n\n76.\n\nClause 8.1 of each of the Participation Contracts set forth the formula for calculating participation percentages. The Contracts allocated oil production on the basis of two variables, namely, the volume of oil produced (the *X* factor) and the quality of crude oil produced (the Y factor).61 According to the formula, as production increases in volume, or quality, the contractor\u2019s participation percentage decreases.62\n\nClause 8.1 of the Block 7 and 21 participation contracts: Exhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04803 and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04687.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n77.\n\nThe Participation Contract for Block 7 sets out the following participation formula:63\n\nExhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04804.\n\n78.\n\nThe Participation Contract for Block 21 sets out the following participation formula:64\n\nExhibit CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04687.\n\n79.\n\nThe Participation Contracts also contained a tax modification clause, which required the application of a \"correction factor\" when changes to the tax regime had an impact on the \"economy\" of the contract. In this regard, the Block 7 Participation Contract stated:\n\n**Modification to the tax regime:** In the event of a modification to the tax regime or the creation or elimination of new taxes not foreseen in this Contract, or a change in the employee profit-sharing regulations in effect on the signature date of this Contract and as described in this Clause, or their interpretation, which have consequences for the economy of this Contract, a correction factor shall be included in the participation percentages, which absorbs the increase or decrease in the tax burden or the employee profit-sharing. This correction factor shall be calculated between the Parties and following the procedure set forth in Article thirty-one (31) of the Regulations for Application of the Law Amending the Hydrocarbons Law.65\n\nExhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, Clause 11.12 (PER 04823-04824).\n\n80.\n\nThe Block 21 Participation Contract stated in similar terms:\n\n**Modification to the tax regime and employee profit sharing:** In the event of a modification to the tax regime, the employee profit-sharing, or their interpretation, which has consequences for the economy of this Contract, a correction factor shall be included in the participation percentages to absorb the increase or decrease in the tax burden. These adjustments shall be approved by the Administrative Council based upon a study that the Contractor will present for this purpose.66\n\nExhibit CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, Clause 11.7 (PER 04699).\n\n**D. Oil price increases and Ecuador\u2019s response**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nShortly after Perenco purchased its interests in Blocks 7 and 21, international oil prices began to rise dramatically. Block 7 produced a crude oil known in the market as \"Oriente Crude\" and Block 21 produced a crude oil known as \"Napo Crude\", the latter considered to be of lower quality than Oriente Crude. During the 1980s and 90s, a period of relative stability in oil prices, the price for Napo and Oriente Crude was around US $15/bbl.67 The WTI benchmark for crude oil at the time was about US $20/bbl.68 These prices remained more or less at the same level until the 2000s.69\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 144.\n\n\"WTI\" is the acronym of an industry benchmark known as \"West Texas Intermediate.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 144 and 145; Exhibit E-75, Precios de los Crudos Ecuatorianos y Diferencias con Respecto al WTI, Nro. 12; Ene. 2006 a Die. 2009, and Ene. 1991 a Die. 2006, published by the Banco Central del Ecuador.\n\n82.\n\nIn early 2002, the price of Ecuadorian crude was still fluctuating around US $15/bbl. By 2005, however, prices had more than tripled, reaching US $50/bbl.70\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n83.\n\nBy 2006, the Ecuadorian crude price had risen to US $60/bbl (US $70/bbl WTI), and by March 2008, it rose further to almost US $90/bbl (US $100/bbl WTI), reaching nearly US $120/bbl (USD $130/bbl WTI) in June 2008.71 The global financial crisis caused oil prices to fall sharply to below US $3O/bbl through 2008 and the beginning of 2009, but prices then began to recover, stabilising in the range of US $60-70/bbl for most of 2009 and 2010.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n84.\n\nIn August 2005, the *Contraloria General del Estado* became concerned about the impact of rising oil prices on the Ecuadorian petroleum sector and undertook an audit of participation contracts and service contracts for the period 1 March 2000 to 30 October 2004.72 The *Contraloria General del Estado* acts as an \"external auditor\" of State agencies in Ecuador, and its directions to agencies regarding their use of public monies are, according to the Respondent, enforceable by way of administrative sanctions.73 It concluded that the increase in oil prices was generating extraordinary profits for oil companies and that the participation contracts should be renegotiated.74 Shortly thereafter, in September 2005, the Board of Directors of Petroecuador recommended that the Special Bidding Committee of Petroecuador initiate renegotiations of all of the participation and service contracts then in force.75\n\nExhibit E-80, *Oficio* No. 039073 from the *Contraloria General del Estado* to Petroecuador dated 22 August 2005.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, p 272 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nExhibit E-80, *Oficio* No. 039073 from the *Contraloria General del Estado* to Petroecuador dated 22 August 2005.\n\nExhibit E-81, *Resoluci\u00f3n* No. 016-DIR-2005-09-13 of Petroecuador\u2019s Board of Directors dated 13 September 2005 and CE-39, *Oil contracts to be reviewed, El Comercio,* 11 September 2005 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\n**E. Origins of the dispute: Events relating to Law 42-2006 Amending the Hydrocarbons Law**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nIn November 2005, the then-President of the Republic of Ecuador, Mr. Luis Alfredo Palacio Gonz\u00e1lez, announced the goal of renegotiating the participation contracts in order to provide the State with a greater share of revenue from crude oil sales.76 Petroecuador then informed oil companies operating in Ecuador of its intention to renegotiate its participation contracts with them.77 The Claimant alleges that while the Ecuadorian government initiated discussions with some oil companies, there were no serious attempts to negotiate with it.78\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 59: on 9 November 2005, according to a news article published by *El Comercio* in Ecuador, it was reported that the \"government will shortly review the contracts with foreign oil companies, with a view to having them leave the State \u2018at least half (50 per cent) of their profits\u2019\" (see Exhibit CE-39, *Oil contracts to be reviewed,* El Comercio, 11 September 2005 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 01547).\n\nExhibit CE-43, *The first phase of the oil renegotiation kicked off with meetings,* El Comercio, 22 November 2005 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 59.\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, alleges that all the oil companies in Ecuador, including Perenco, refused to renegotiate their contracts.79\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 17; Rejoinder, paragraphs 320-328; see also, Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, pp 273-274 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\n87.\n\nBefore announcing its intention, in November 2005 Petroecuador wrote to the Chairman of the Permanent Specialized Commission on Civil and Criminal Matters in Ecuador regarding the proposal to renegotiate oil and gas contracts.80 Referring to the Regulations for Application for the Law Reforming Law 44, Petroecuador stated:\n\nArticle 32 of the mentioned Regulations establishes the procedure to be followed for the contractual modification submitted for approval to the CEL. In summary, this procedure indicates that the contractual modifications may be proposed by either of the parties, and it corresponds to PETROECUADOR to negotiate them with the contractor, requiring always the prior consent of the other party. In the event that a mutual agreement is reached based on the respective specifications, the CEO shall submit the modifications agreed upon with the contractor to the Board of Directors for its information and for a report.81\n\nExhibit CE-40, Letter from Petroecuador to Congressman Luis Fernando Torres regarding the renegotiation of oil contracts, 11 October 2005 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\n*Ibid.,* PER 01557.\n\n**(1) The enactment of Law 42**\n-------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nOn 1 March 2006, President Palacio submitted a bill to Congress proposing to amend the Hydrocarbons Law (a **\"Bill for the Law Reforming the Hydrocarbons Law\"** or the **\"Bill\"),** stating in the accompanying explanatory memorandum that he \"ha[d] invited the oil companies that have contracts with the Ecuadorian State to begin processes of reaching an understanding for the equitable distribution of the extraordinary earnings.\"82\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 25; Exhibits CE-50, Bill of the Law amending Hydrocarbons Law, presented by President Palacio to the President of Congress, 1 March 2006 (in Spanish and English), PER 01722 and CE-51, Legislative Debates on Draft Legislation, 9 March 2006, 29 March 2006, 19 April 2006 (in Spanish with English excerpts); see also, Counter-Memorial, paragraph 178.\n\n89.\n\nThe cover letter of the Bill stated that it \"should be processed as economically urgent\" and that its rationale may be summed up \"as the recovery of economic equity to the benefit of the State in hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation contracts entered into by the Republic of Ecuador.\"83 The significant increase in prices, the explanatory memorandum stated further, \"obligates the National Government to submit reforms to the Hydrocarbons Law to the National Congress.\"84\n\nExhibit CE-50, Bill of the Law amending Hydrocarbons Law, presented by President Palacio to the President of Congress, 1 March 2006 (in Spanish and English), PER 01718.\n\n*Ibid.,* PER 01719.\n\n90.\n\nThe memorandum stated further that \"[t]he contracts for oil and gas exploration and exploitation in Ecuador were entered into considering the *rebus sic stantibus* [\u2018things standing thus\u2019] clause, which means that the contracts are understood to have been reached under the tacit condition that the original conditions contracted will subsist, and that when this is not so and a change in those circumstances occurs, equilibrium in the contractual obligations needs to be reestablished to the extent that something extraordinary and unforeseeable has an impact on what the parties had foreseen, on which economic basis they assumed their obligations.\"85 It concluded that \"[a]t all times, the equilibrium of the contracts is being maintained, since all the technical, economic and legal parameters considered by the companies in their analysis are being respected, and what is being legislated upon are those events that never formed a part of the will of the parties, such as the extraordinary increase in crude oil prices at the international level.\"86\n\nExhibit CE-50, Bill of the Law amending Hydrocarbons Law, presented by President Palacio to the President of Congress, 1 March 2006 (in Spanish and English), PER 01719; see also, Revised Memorial, paragraph 63.\n\nExhibit CE-50, Bill of the Law amending Hydrocarbons Law, presented by President Palacio to the President of Congress, 1 March 2006 (in Spanish and English), PER 01721.\n\n91.\n\nThe National Congress of Ecuador convened an extraordinary meeting on 29 March 2006 to debate the Bill. The Claimant directed the Tribunal to statements made by various members of Congress which displayed a range of opinion. One representative asserted \"here we are going to know who is who; either we vote for the motherland, for the people, for the poor, for the humble, or we vote for the transnational companies that have stolen our blood, our life, our hope.\"87 Another representative focused on the nature of the contractual relations Petroecuador had entered into with the oil companies, noting that: \"...faced with the bill sent by the President of the Republic, we have discussed if under the law whether or not we can by law unilaterally amend oil contracts with retroactive effect. That and nothing else is the legal discussion.\"88\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 65; citing Exhibit CE-51, Bill of the Law amending Hydrocarbons Law, presented by President Palacio to the President of Congress, 1 March 2006 (in Spanish and English), PER 01980.\n\n*Ibid.,* PER 01990.\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that ascertaining the intent of the legislative body by means of reference to the statements of individual legislators is notoriously difficult and apt to lead to a misapprehension of the intent of the legislature as a whole which is reflected in its acts. It has taken note of these and other statements, but it has not attempted to use them as a means of attaching legal significance to the acts of the legislature.\n\n93.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Congress passed the Law No. 2006-42 Amending the Hydrocarbons Law (the **\"HCL Amendment\")** on 19 April 2006.89 The Law's preamble referred to the Ecuadorian State\u2019s duty to \"defend the natural heritage of the country and preserve the sustainable growth of the economy, as well as balanced, equitable development for the collective good.\"90 It referred to Article 247 of the Constitution, stating that \"subsoil resources are the inalienable and imprescriptible property of the Ecuadorian government and, therefore, its exploitation must take place on the basis of national interests and in accordance with the principle of reasonability.\"91\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 26; Exhibit CE-5 3, HCL Amendment.\n\nExhibit CE-53, HCL Amendment, PER 02030.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n94.\n\nArticle 2 of the HCL Amendment stated as follows:\n\n\"Article... Participation of the State in surplus prices from the sale of oil and gas not agreed upon or not foreseen. Contractor companies that maintain participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in effect with the Ecuadorian state under this Law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil subject to participation that corresponds to them, when the effective monthly medium price of FOB sale of Ecuadorian oil petroleum goes above the monthly average prices in effect at the time of the execution of the contract, expressed in constant prices for the month of liquidation, will recognize in favor of the Ecuadorian state a participation of at least 50% of the extraordinary income generated by the difference in price. For purposes of this Article, extraordinary revenues shall be understood to mean the difference in the above-de scribed price, multiplied by the number of barrels produced.\"92\n\nExhibit CE-53, HCL Amendment, PER 02030.\n\n95.\n\nFollowing this, Decree No. 1583 Implementing Law 42-2006 was formally issued on 23 June 2006.93\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 67.\n\n**(2) Implementation of Law 42**\n--------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nOn 6 July 2006, the Ministry of Energy and Mines notified Perenco by letter that the prices in effect at the time of execution of the Block 7 and 21 Participation Contracts were US $25.111383 and US $15.358274.94 These became the relevant \"reference\" prices for the purpose of Article 2 of the HCL Amendment.\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 29 and as evidenced in Exhibit CE-13 to Amended Request, English translation of the Letter from the DNH to Perenco notifying the reference prices in effect at the time of execution of the contracts, 6 July 2006 and English translation of the Letter from the DNH to Perenco notifying the applicable inflation rate to the reference prices for Blocks 7 and 21, 25 March 2008.\n\n97.\n\nIn July 2006, for instance, the market price for Oriente Crude from Block 7 was US $65.66/bbl and the adjusted reference price was US $30.01/bbl. Thus, the Law 42 \"levy\" (to use the Respondent\u2019s term in this arbitration95) was US $17,825 per barrel of oil produced in Block 7 (50% of the difference between US $65.66/bbl and US $30.01/bbl). Law 42 would give the Government of Ecuador an increased participation in the revenues generated from all sales above such reference prices. On the foregoing example, the Contractor would realise US $47,835 on the sale of a barrel of oil, rather than the market price of US $65.66/bbl.\n\nSee, for example, Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 185, 422, 460, 482, 527 *et seq.*\n\n98.\n\nOn 13 July 2006, the Government issued Executive Decree No. 1672 Implementing Law 42-2006, which replaced Decree No. 1583 Implementing Law 42-2006 of 23 June 2006 (the **\"First Implementing Regulation\").96**\n\nExhibit CE-58, Decree No. 1672, Implementing Law 42-2006 Amending the Hydrocarbons Law, Official Registry No. 312, 13 July 2006 (in Spanish with English translation) **(\"Decree No. 1672\").**\n\n99.\n\nIt, amongst other things, identified the kind of agreements covered by the HCL Amendment, set the exact percentage of \"extraordinary income\" payable to the State (50%), provided the formula to assist in determining the corresponding quantum, and stipulated that payments pursuant to Law 42 were to be made on a monthly basis.97\n\nExhibit CE-58, Decree No. 1672.\n\n100.\n\nAfter the law was enacted, by letter dated 26 July 2006 Perenco wrote to the Central Bank of Ecuador, copied to Petroleum Contracts Administrative Unit of Petroecuador, referring to the letter it received from the latter notifying it of its Law 42 dues for Block 21, and enclosing a cheque for US $14,525,361.00. Perenco \"state[d] for the record\" that it considered Law 42 to be \"unconstitutional along with other legal entities that have filed their respective actions with the Constitutional Court\" and that it \"violates certain rights of Consortium members explicitly contained in the Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21, and in certain International Treaties\", but that until the law was declared as such, it would make the payment under protest and with its rights reserved.98\n\nExhibit CE-263, Letter from the Consortium to Banco Central del Ecuador, 26 July 2006 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 04279.\n\n101.\n\nAs Perenco\u2019s letter noted, around this time a Constitutional Court challenge was launched by Mr. Mauricio Pinto Mancheno in his own interests and in the interests that he represented as the Chairman of the Chamber of Manufacturers of Pinchincha, as well as the legal representative of one thousand citizens (based on Article 276(1) of the Constitution of Ecuador).99 There is no record evidence as to the membership of the Chamber of Manufacturers. It was contended by the Respondent that it was obvious that the oil companies were behind the claim, but there is not sufficient evidence of this to make any kind of finding of fact, although the judgment did record the contention of the Head of the Congress in answer to the petition that Mr. Pinto was the \"official defender of multinational oil companies that allegedly, in the plaintiffs view, are harmed or injured by the challenged law\".100\n\nExhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal decision of 31 August 2006 regarding the Constitutionality of Law 42, Official Registry (Supplement) 350, 6 September 2006 (in Spanish with English translation) (Revised translation as agreed by parties submitted 2013-12-04) **(\"Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42\").**\n\nExhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42, p 19. At the hearing, Mr. Eduardo Silva Romero contended that the \"constitutional challenge was sponsored by oil companies, obviously.\" Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, p 277.\n\n102.\n\nOn 6 September 2006, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that Law 42 was constitutional and further that it did not violate the principles of Ecuadorian civil law concerning the performance of the contracts.101 The petitioners had challenged the form and substantive constitutionality of Law 42, submitting that it amounted to a modification of the legal system to which oil contracts with the State were subject, violating fundamental rights to certainty, nonretroactivity, property, and the modification of administrative contracts by agreement only.102 The Constitutional Tribunal examined the distinction between administrative and civil law contracts under Ecuadorian law, and then between administrative contracts for the provision of public services and otherwise. It concluded that unlike contracts between private parties, the Administration in an administrative contract \"is placed in a privileged position with respect to what is being administered...[a]nd it is precisely this position of privilge that allows the government...to exercise the power to modify or revise the agreement\".103\n\nExhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42, p 27.\n\n*Ibid.,pp* 18-19.\n\nIbid., p 24.\n\n103.\n\nA relevant illustration of this was that the *pacta sunt servanda* principle applicable to the contract had the potential to \"fall apart when causes emerge that substantially alter[ed] those that formed the reality or the state of things upon which the contract was executed.\"104 The Court held that Law 42 fell within the ambit of this principle, creating \"obligations on subjects that ha[d] not been the subject of contractual stipulation, which ha[d] not been negotiated or anticipated\" by the parties to the contracts.105 It buttressed this further by concluding that Article 249 of the Constitution, which prohibited unilateral modifications of contracts by legislation, did not apply to oil contracts with the State because Article 249 referred exclusively to administrative contracts for the provision of public services (which differed from contracts for hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation), and the State would waive expressly its power to modify in the contract, as recognized in Article 271 of the Constitution.106 Finally, the Court held that Law 42 did not violate the constitutional guarantee against retroactivity, or the right to property since hydrocarbons are a non-renewable natural resource subject to public dominion.107\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nExhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42, p 25.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nExhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42, pp 25-27.\n\n104.\n\nDuring this time, Perenco continued to invest in Blocks 7 and 21. According to the Claimant, as 2006 drew to a close, it had invested some US $55,004,000 and US $46,938,000 in Blocks 21 and 7, respectively, for the year.108 From April 2006 to October 2007, the Consortium invested an additional US $61 million and drilled an additional 15 wells in Blocks 7 and 21 compared to the previous year.109 The Consortium also submitted to Ecuador on 6 November 2006 an amendment to its development plan for Block 7 in relation to the Oso field.110 Its development plan indicated that it anticipated continued positive cash flows in the midst of the initial application of Law 42 at a rate of 50%.111 The 2006 Oso Development Plan was approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mines in Ecuador in March 2007.112\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 48 and 52.\n\nWitness Statement of Lament Combe, paragraph 20.\n\nExhibit E-77, Amendment to the Additional Development Plan for Block 7 - Oso Field dated October 2006 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\n*Ibid.,* p 7.; Witness Statement of Lament Combe, paragraphs 11 and 20, as clarified in his testimony, Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, p 508 (Testimony of Lament Combe).\n\nExhibit E-128, Ministry of Energy and Mines Decree No. 40 approving the 2006 Oso Development Plan dated 9 March 2007 (in Spanish with English translation), p 4; Witness Statement of Lament Combe, paragraph 20.\n\n105.\n\nThis did not, however, detract from the concerns expressed by Perenco with regard to Law 42's economic impact on its Ecuadorian operations. On 18 December 2006, Perenco wrote to Petroecuador, requesting that the latter initiate the administrative process whereby the parties would analyse the economic impact of Law 42 on Blocks 7 and 21 pursuant to clause 11 of both Contracts, and stated its intention to file the necessary economic data in support of its request to adjust the percentage of participation in its favour.113 Petroecuador did not respond officially to this request.\n\nExhibits E-129, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December 2006 (Block 21) (in Spanish with English translation) and E-130, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December 2006 (Block 7) (in Spanish with English translation).\n\n106.\n\nDuring the hearing, there was a substantial exchange between the parties as to the timing of this request and specifically whose responsibility it was to deal with the adjustment of the participation in the circumstances.\n\n107.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, on a proper construction of the Participation Contracts, the onus was on the contractor to substantiate its claim that a new or increased tax affected the economy of the Contracts.114 Notably, Dr. Chiriboga, who was at the time the President of Petroecuador, testified that the burden was on Perenco to prove to the State that, contrary to its evaluation of the impact of Law 42, the equilibrium of the Contracts had been modified to such an extent that it triggered the administrative process provided for therein.115\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, pp 279-280 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero) where the Respondent submits that Perenco failed to provide Petroecuador with the evidence illustrating the impact of Law 42 on the economy of the Participation Contracts, which in its submission was necessary.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 4, p 1016 (Testimony of Galo Chiriboga Zambrano).\n\n108.\n\nFor its part, the Claimant asserted first, that it had taken sufficient steps to initiate the process and second, that it received informal signs of a negative reaction from the Ecuadorian authorities then in office (in mid-December 2006, the Palacios administration was about to leave office). One of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses, Mr. Laurent Combe, testified that although Perenco calculated Law 42\u2019s impact on the economy of the Contracts, it did not send the data because it would be too confrontational. Mr. Combe testified that no further action was taken in support of the application because the company did not wish to exacerbate relations with the Government.116 It is common ground that the taxation modification negotiations contemplated in clause 11 of both Contracts did not take place.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, pp 521-524 (Testimony of Laurent Combe). Mr. Combe\u2019s evidence was that while Perenco had the numbers available, its request of 18 December 2006 was to prompt the initiation of the process during which the information would be formally presented. This was reiterated by the witness in his reexamination when asked what he expected would follow the letter of 18 December 2006 to Petroecuador: Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, pp 530-531.\n\n109.\n\nOn 4 October 2007, the administration of President Rafael Correa Delgado issued a further decree, Decree No. 662 (the **\"Second Implementing Regulation\"),** which increased the State\u2019s share of revenue from sales above the reference price from 50% to 99%.117 Dr. Chiriboga, then the Minister of Mines and Petroleum in Ecuador, testified that this percentage was chosen based on financial analysis undertaken within or on behalf of Ecuadorian state agencies and discussed in meetings with the President.118\n\nExhibit CE-64, Decree No. 662, Implementing Law 42-2006 Amending the Hydrocarbons Law, 4 October 2007 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 4, pp 947-948 (Testimony of Galo Chiriboga Zambrano).\n\n110.\n\nThus, from October 2007, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, Perenco was obliged to deliver to Ecuador, in addition to its contractually agreed participation in volume, an additional participation in revenue of at least 99% of its income from all sales of oil above the applicable reference price (which, as noted above in paragraph 96, varied as between Block 7 and Block 21 oil).119\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 69.\n\n**(3) Payments under Law 42, the initiation of ICSID arbitration, negotiations and** ***Ley de Equidad Tributaria***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nPerenco (and its fellow member of the consortium, Burlington) made payments pursuant to the HCL Amendment from July 2006 through to April 2008.120\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 30; Revised Memorial, paragraph 126. The Consortium began to make such payments pursuant to Law 42, under protest, on 26 July 2006: Exhibit CE-263, Letter from the Consortium to Banco Central del Ecuador, 26 July 2006 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\n112.\n\nShortly after the Second Implementing Regulation adjusted the percentage of \"extraordinary revenue\" to 99% in favour of the State, on 17 October 2007, Perenco wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum notifying Ecuador that it \"accepted] and [gave] its consent to the offer of Ecuador to submit any dispute related to the [HCL Amendment], or with any other measure that impacts Perenco\u2019s investments in Ecuador, to the International Centre Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"CIADI\") for their resolution through arbitration according to Article 25 of the [Convention] and Article 9 of the Treaty.\"121\n\nExhibit CE-264, Letter from Perenco to Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, October 17, 2007 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 04284; Amended Request, paragraph 15.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal notes parenthetically that on this date, the late Hubert Perrodo\u2019s estate in the Bahamas was un-administered and un-distributed.122 It will revert to this state of affairs below.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 38.\n\n114.\n\nThroughout the period in which Perenco paid the Law 42 duties, it did so on a \"without prejudice\" or *\"bajo protesta\"* basis.123\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 76; see Exhibits CE-66, Letter from Perenco to Petroecuador regarding payment under protest of Law 42 assessments and negotiation of contracts, 14 December 2007, (in Spanish with English translation), CE-68, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador regarding payment under protest of Law 42 assessment and negotiations of contracts, 18 February 2008 (in Spanish with English translation) (18 February 2008 letter from Perenco in response to 15 January 2008 notification from Ecuador), and CE-70, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador regarding payment under protest of Law 42 assessment and negotiations of contracts, 15 April 2008 (in Spanish with English translation) (15 April 2008 letter from Perenco in response to 13 March 2008 notification from Ecuador).\n\n115.\n\nAt the same time, it is common ground that Perenco was willing to consider working with the Government of Ecuador in arriving at a compromise. It wrote to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum on 24 October 2007 requesting information regarding the model of the service agreement the Government was proposing to use as the basis for negotiations moving forward.124 During the hearing, Dr. Chiriboga testified that while Ecuador had by this time contracted the services of the Mexico office of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP to produce a model of the proposed service contract and some drafts were available, they had not been discussed internally.125 Consequently, Ecuador determined it was not in a position to accede to Perenco\u2019s request and did not respond to it.126\n\nExhibit CE-265, Letter from the Consortium to Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, 24 October 2007 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\nTranscript, Day 4, Hearing on the Merits, p 933 (Testimony of Galo Chiriboga Zambrano).\n\nTranscript, Day 4, Hearing on the Merits, pp 933-935 (Testimony of Galo Chiriboga Zambrano).\n\n116.\n\nOn 29 December 2007, Ecuador passed a further law, the *Ley de Equidad Tributaria* (the **\"LET\"),** an initiative to facilitate new negotiations between the government and oil companies.127 This law contemplated an alternative to the strict application of Law 42 at 99% by providing for: a tax rate at 70%, a statutory reference price not fixed by Ecuador but subject to negotiation on a case-by-case basis, and applicable only to oil companies that also agreed to enter into \"transitory agreements\" to transform their existing Participation Contracts into an agreement more akin to a service contract model, to come into effect from January 2008.128\n\nExhibit EL-86, *Ley de Equidad Tributaria,* Articles 164 to 172, 29 December 2007 (in Spanish with English translation); Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 190-191,\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n117.\n\nIn a national address delivered on 23 January 2008, President Correa set out his view as to the options available to oil companies operating in Ecuador under a Participation Contract, stating that a company could either pay the State its share of the extraordinary revenue under Law 42, renegotiate its contract into a service agreement or terminate the contract, with the State compensating the company for the monetary expense it had incurred thus far pursuant to its participation contract.129 In connection with the option to renegotiate, the President stated that a service agreement model \"always should have been the preponderant figure in the oil industry\" and that companies had 45 days to come to a renegotiated agreement with the State or continue paying their dues under Law 42.130\n\nExhibit CE-67, Excerpt from the 53rd National Address of President Rafael Correa, San Miguel de Salcedo, 26 January 2008 (in Spanish with English translation, re-submitted on 04-12-12).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n118.\n\nDuring the course of 2008 the Parties sought to negotiate an alternative model to the existing Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21.131\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 78; see also, Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 3, p 560 (Testimony of Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9) where Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9 confirms that Perenco was aware that it was Ecuador\u2019s intention that the negotiations should result in converting participation contracts to service contracts.\n\n119.\n\nNegotiations between Petroecuador and Perenco (in its capacity as the operator of the Consortium) began on 21 January 2008 and carried on, albeit fitfully at times, throughout the balance of the year.132 According to Mr. Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, Perenco\u2019s Country Manager in Ecuador, \"[t]hroughout 2008 [Perenco] made repeated attempts to seek compromises that would be acceptable to all parties\", and he \"personally attended many meetings, had phone conversations, exchanged written correspondence, analyzed various proposals and took other steps to try to find a deal.\"133 Minister Chiriboga agreed that in 2008 \"[i]n general, there was a good cooperation between the State and Perenco in order to reach an agreement that would benefit [both]\" and stated \"[he] met Perenco\u2019s representatives, either individually or jointly with other companies, to discuss the progress of the negotiations, as often as requested.\"134\n\nExhibits CE-266, Record of initiation of negotiations of the Participation Contracts between Perenco and Petroecuador, 20 January 2008, and Attendance Lists, 21-28 January 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), and CE-268, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador, 1 February 2008 (in Spanish with English translation); see also, Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 3, pp 558-560 (Testimony of Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9). For example, Perenco on behalf of the consortium wrote to the coordinator of Petroecuador\u2019s negotiation team with a \"financial proposal\" for the renegotiation of the Block 7 and 21 Contracts (see Exhibit CE-268, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador, 1 February 2008 (in Spanish with English translation)). Mr. Rodrigo M\u00e1rquez Pacanins, Group Assistant General Counsel of Perenco Group from 2001 to 2008, testified that Perenco granted a request by Burlington to be present at the negotiations up till April 2008 because it would \"facilitate the negotiation process\", even though it was understood that it was Perenco which had acted on behalf of the Consortium in the negotiations: see Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 3, p 717 (Testimony of Rodrigo M\u00e1rquez).\n\n1st Witness Statement of Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, paragraph 14; Revised Memorial, paragraph 83.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Galo Chiriboga Zambrano, paragraphs 12-25.\n\n120.\n\nWhile events unfolded in Ecuador, the heirs to Hubert Perrodo were disputing their respective entitlements to the estate. On 15 February 2008, Madame Perrodo filed a caveat in the Supreme Court of the Bahamas to preclude any grant of Letters of Administration being made in respect of the estate.135 (This caveat was later withdrawn by Madame Perrodo on 30 March 2009).136\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 28, caveat found at Exhibit E-72, Caveat filed in the Supreme Court of The Bahamas by Carrie Perrodo in the Estate of Hubert Perrodo dated 15 February 2008.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 28, withdrawal of caveat found at Exhibit E-73, Notice of Withdrawal filed in the Supreme Court of The Bahamas by Carrie Perrodo in the Estate of Hubert Perrodo dated 30 March 2009.\n\n121.\n\nIn March 2008, Petroecuador and Perenco reached a preliminary agreement (the \"Acto *de Acuerdo Partial\")* regarding Block 7.137 This \"transitory agreement\" provided that: (i) Block 7 would continue to be operated under the participation sharing model for five years before being migrated to another contract model (more akin to service contract model); (ii) the term of the Block 7 contract, which was set to expire in 2010, would be extended until 2018; (iii) Ecuador\u2019s share would be increased for the period 2008 to 2010, and thereafter linked to oil prices for the period 2010 to 2018; and (iv) the statutory reference price would be increased to US $42.5/bbl (from US $ 25.111383 as of 6 July 2006).138\n\nExhibits E-84, *Acta de Acuerdo Parcial* signed by Perenco and Petroecuador dated 11 March 2008, and CE-269, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador, 11 March 2008 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n122.\n\nThereafter, the Consortium wrote to Petroecuador setting out its proposals for Blocks 7 and 21 on 11 March 2008 and 25 March 2008, respectively, and it appears that the parties were relatively close to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement on making a transition to a new contractual model.139 The benefit to Perenco (when compared to the status quo) was clear in that it would have another eight years to exploit Block 7 and the revenue sharing obligation would be triggered at a higher reference price.140\n\nExhibits CE-269, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador, 11 March 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), and CE-270, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador, 25 March 2008 (in Spanish with English translation); see also, E-84, *Acta de Acuerdo Parcial* signed by Perenco and Petroecuador dated 11 March 2008.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n123.\n\nHowever, on 12 April 2008, President Correa announced that all existing production-sharing agreements were to be terminated within the year and new contracts would be employed, the form and particulars of which were unspecified.141 Contractors were informed that it would be a common service contract model.142\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 31; Revised Memorial, paragraph 78; CE-69, *Negotiations with oil companies come to a halt,* El Comercio (online edition), 13 April 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), available at http://www2.elcomercio.com/noticiaEC.asp?id noticia=184277&id seccion=3. *Correa proposes \"single model\" for contracts with foreign oil companies,* El Diario (online edition), 14 April 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), available at http://www.eldiario.com.ee/noticias-manabi-ecuador/75940. *Government to propose six month agreement with oil companies,* El Comercio (online edition), 15 April, 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), available at http://www2.elcomercio.com/noticiaEC.asp?id noticia=184439&id seccion=6.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Galo Chiriboga Zambrano, paragraphs 15-17.

Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9 testified that that \"after months of what [was] thought were productive negotiations, this announcement was very surprising.\"143 An article in the Ecuadorian newspaper *El Comercio,* dated 13 April 2008, entitled, \"Negotiations with oil companies come to a halt\", reported that \"[n]egotiations with oil companies were suspended by a decision from the President\" and \"[e]ven though the Head of State had given a term of 45 days for negotiations to conclude\" \"[a]t the last minute, he decided that new contracts would not be signed.\"144 A quote from a radio address by President Correa in an article in the online edition of Ecuador\u2019s *El Diario,* dated 14 April 2008, entitled \"Correa proposes \u2018single model\u2019 for contracts with foreign oil companies\" quoted the President as to the reasoning behind his decision to suspend negotiations:\n\n\"I said 45 days, I think in January, for renegotiation of contracts... We were close to a deal, but I stopped it, because, even though we've secured major benefits, I think that we can do better.\"145\n\n1st Witness Statement of Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, paragraph 9.\n\nExhibit CE-69, *Negotiations with oil companies come to a halt,* El Comercio (online edition), 13 April 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), available at http://www2.elcomercio.com/noticiaEC.asp?id noticia=184277&id seccion=3. *Correa proposes \"single mode! \" for contracts with foreign oil companies,* El Diario (online edition), 14 April 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), available at http://www.eldiario.com,ec/noticias-manabi-ecuador/75940. *Government to propose six month agreement with oil companies,* El Comercio (online edition), 15 April 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), available at http://www2.elcomercio.com/noticiaEC.asp?id noticia=184439&id seccion=6.

The agreement included a term obliging Petroecuador and its counterparty to \"take best efforts so that, within a period of 120 days, they can sign the new Service Agreement for Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons, and as a show of good faith, the Contractor will suspend its proceedings before ICSID.\"150 This was followed by a letter from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, dated 13 June 2008, in which it stated that all oil companies were to sign amended agreements with the State which would include a commitment to migrate to a service provision agreement within one year.151 Perenco refused to do so.152 Dr. Chiriboga testified that, at this time, the draft proposed \"service contract\" had not as yet been provided to contractors.153\n\nExhibit CE-273, Ecuador draft \"transitional negotiation agreement,\" 16 May 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 04502.\n\nExhibit CE-71, Letter from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum to Perenco and other oil companies regarding the migration to service provision agreements, 13 June 2008 (in Spanish with English translation).

Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal P\u00e9troleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)),155* in which that tribunal had ordered Ecuador to refrain from asserting Law 42 payment demands during the pendency of the arbitration. Perenco proposed the option of transferring the disputed Law 42 payments into an escrow account, maintained by an independent escrow agent in a neutral location, pending the resolution of its dispute with Ecuador.156 This proposal was not accepted by Ecuador and for the balance of 2008 (and into 2009) the Consortium deposited the disputed Law 42 amounts into a segregated account located outside of Ecuador.157\n\nExhibit CE-72, Letter from Perenco and Burlington to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador proposing an escrow account for transfer of disputed Law 42 payments, 19 June 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 02204.\n\n*City Oriente Ltd v.

He challenged what he described as their \"defiance\", and commented on the impact that the State\u2019s actions might have on Ecuador\u2019s relationship with the governments of France and Spain:\n\nBut two companies, Perenco and Repsol, with which Burlington is also allied, have wasted our time. Agreements were reached, and then backed out of. I believe, I fear, that they thought they were still dealing with previous administrations. Gentlemen, we will not permit that. This is going to create friction with the governments of France and Spain, which are very protective of their transnational corporations, and for this we are sorry. We like these governments and hold them in high esteem, but on this subject we must observe our national sovereignty and our national interests.190\n\nExhibit CE-87, Excerpt from the informal transcript of the statements made by President Rafael Correa, Quito, 14 February 2009 (in Spanish with English translation);

The Attorney-General, according to Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, maintained in this meeting that he was not in a position to intercede in the dispute, suggesting that Perenco focus its efforts on communicating with Minister Palacios and Rear-Admiral Jaramillo.232\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Eric d\u2019 Argentr\u00e9, paragraph 10; Revised Memorial, paragraph 105.\n\n174.\n\nPerenco\u2019s representatives (Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9 and Ms. Gabriela Rumazo, Perenco\u2019s then-legal counsel in Ecuador) then met with Mr. Alexis Mera, Legal Counsel to President Correa, on 14 May 2009 at the Presidential Palace. Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9 testified that they related to Mr. Mera the chronology of events and the detrimental impact of the HCL Amendment and the events following it on Perenco\u2019s operations in Ecuador.233 Mr. Mera, according to Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, is said to have responded to the suggestion that Ecuador \"consider cancelling the auctions as a good faith gesture\" so that negotiations could proceed as follows: \"Ecuador did not intend to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s provisional measures orders and that the auction would go forward regardless.\"234\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Eric d\u2019 Argentr\u00e9, paragraph 13.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n175.\n\nPerenco then wrote to Mr. Patricio Uteras Hidalgo, the Judge who ordered the seizure of Perenco\u2019s crude on 14 May 2009, and to Mr. Wong Loon, President of OCP Ecuador S.A., on 15 May 2009. Perenco referred to the Tribunal\u2019s order of 8 May 2009, describing it as having resulted in an international obligation upon Ecuador and its state agencies to refrain from \"further seizing and auctioning Block 7 and Block 21 crude oil, and entitles Perenco to full, effective and immediate control of such crude oil.\"235\n\nExhibits CE-211, Letter from Perenco to Wong Loon, President of Oleoducto De Crudos Pesados Ecuador, S.A., (OCP) regarding redelivery of crude oil, 15 May 2009 and CE-210, Letter from Perenco to Patricio Utreras Hidalgo regarding redelivery of crude oil, 14 May 2009 (in Spanish with English translation); Revised Memorial, paragraph 105.\n\n176.\n\nOn 15 May 2009, Ecuador proceeded as scheduled with its auction of the seized crude oil. Approximately 720,000 barrels of Napo crude and 720,000 barrels of Oriente crude seized from the Blocks were to be sold.236 No buyers attended the auction.237\n\nExhibit CE-114, Press announcement regarding the public auction of Perenco\u2019s oil production seized by Petroecuador (Oriente Crude), to take place on 15 May 2009 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 02543 and 02544; Revised Memorial, paragraph 107.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 109; Counter-Memorial, paragraph 231.\n\n177.\n\nOn that same day, counsel for the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, addressing the relationship between the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures and the auction:\n\nEcuador has the highest respect for this learned Tribunal, and has carefully considered the recommendations set forth in the Decision. Ecuador wishes to inform the Tribunal, however, that it is not in a position to implement certain of the recommendations at this time, in so far as they would restrain Ecuador from enforcing Law 42 against Perenco or the Consortium of which it is a member.\n\nLaw 42 and its implementing Decrees (referred to herein collectively as \u2018Law 42\u2019) were enacted at the highest levels of government, and have been upheld by the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court. Under the circumstances, Law 42 must be applied and enforced, lest the integrity of the legal order be undermined. Were any public officials to refuse to do so in relation to Perenco or the Consortium, they would face serious sanctions for failing to carry out their duties, notwithstanding the Decision.\n\n\u2026\n\nNevertheless, Ecuador is committed to furthering the central goal of the Decision, namely to avoid any actions that would undermine the effectiveness of any potential award that might be issued (should the Tribunal ultimately affirm its jurisdiction and proceed to the merits). To that end, Ecuador intends to carry out the enforcement of Law 42 in such a way as to avoid any disruption of Perenco\u2019s business. In particular, Ecuador does not intend to seize any assets of the Consortium beyond oil equivalent in value to the outstanding debt. Nor does Ecuador intend to terminate the relevant Participation Contracts, or take legal action against Perenco representatives.238\n\nExhibit CE-212, Letter from Respondents regarding the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures and Law 42, 15 May 2009.\n\n178.\n\nCounsel for the Claimant responded to Ecuador\u2019s letter on 19 May 2009.239 Referring to what it described as Ecuador\u2019s \"disrespect\" and \"disregard\" of the Decision on Provisional Measures, it stated this reflected \"in words a policy Respondents have in recent days also communicated through deeds, including service of additional Law 42 assessment notices, convening an auction to sell seized crude oil (which failed when no buyers bid) and failing to respond to Perenco\u2019s overture to discuss the Tribunal directed escrow arrangement.\"240\n\nExhibit CE-213, Letter from Perenco regarding Respondent's non-compliance with provisional measures, 19 May 2009.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n179.\n\nPerenco referred to Ecuador\u2019s statement that it intended to carry out the enforcement of Law 42 in such a way as to avoid disruption of Perenco\u2019s business by stating \"Perenco simply cannot operate indefinitely without revenues and funding losses. Nor should it be coerced into doing so.\"241\n\n*Ibid.,* PER 03699.\n\n**(3) Efforts to compromise and proposed settlement offer**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nOn 21 May 2009, Perenco submitted to Ecuador a proposed settlement offer that, according to Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, \"include[d] terms which had seemed amenable to Ecuador during past negotiations.\"242 The terms of this proposal was that Ecuador would receive 70% above the applicable reference price (US $42.50 per barrel for Block 7 and US $48.00 for Block 21), would retain all the payments made till May 2009 in respect of Law 42, in addition receiving a fixed amount of US $2,725,000 monthly for a period of 6 months and a variable amount equal to the total barrels of crude produced each month by both blocks (not counting the State\u2019s participation in barrels) multiplied by US $5.00, and in exchange the term of the participation contract for Block 7 would be extended to June 2021 and the contracts\u2019 terms to otherwise remain the same in all other respects.243\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Eric d\u2019 Argentr\u00e9, paragraph 15.\n\nExhibit E-94, Letter from Perenco to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador dated 21 May 2009, p 4. In exchange, the State would agree not to \"present any demand related to Law 42 or any similar demand during the duration of the Participation Contracts for Block 7 and 21\", and would refund to Perenco the 1.44 million barrels which were the subject of the first auction for the Consortium \"to sell and distribute the income from the sale \"according to the terms of the Participation Contracts.\" If the terms were met, the Claimant undertook to \"stipulate that the arbitration proceedings before the ICSID [would be] suspended.\"\n\n181.\n\nIt appears that representatives of the Government of Ecuador considered this offer provocative.244 A week after submitting its proposal, Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9 and Ms. Rumazo were summoned to Minister Palacios\u2019 office, who, according to Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, stated that President Correa was offended by the settlement offer, that Ecuador refused to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s decision and Perenco had one week to submit a revised proposal or be expelled from the country.245\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, p 315 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Eric d\u2019 Argentr\u00e9, paragraph 16; Revised Memorial, paragraph 112.\n\n182.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Derlis Palacios refers to this meeting with Perenco in late May 2009.246 He testified that during the meeting he discussed the proposal Ecuador had received and which he considered \"was not serious.\"247 Mr. Palacios characterised the proposed offer as \"a clear provocation.\"248 He added that, in his opinion, the proposal was an attempt by Perenco to seek \"confrontation in order to make use of any reaction by the State in this arbitration.\"249\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Derlis Palacios, paragraph 35.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n183.\n\nFollowing this meeting, the Claimant wrote to Minister Palacios, stressing that it did not intend to offend him or the Government of Ecuador, and explaining that it had presented the proposal only with the intention of putting a \"quick end to the controversy that has divided us.\"250\n\nExhibit CE-215, Letter from Perenco to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, regarding proposed settlement agreement, 27 May 27 2009 (in Spanish with English translation), T-PER 03705; Revised Memorial, paragraph 105.\n\n184.\n\nPerenco stated that if the offer was not to the satisfaction of Ecuador, the Parties should alternatively proceed with the option of depositing disputed sums of Law 42 debts into an escrow account and \"return to normal operations\" while the arbitration continued.251 Addressing the threat of expulsion, Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9 stated:\n\nIf, as you indicated to me on Monday at our meeting, Ecuador decides in any event to expel Perenco and Burlington from the country, we realize that there is nothing that we can do to stop you. If that is the road that Ecuador chooses then we suggest a meeting at least to discuss the technical means for us to hand over operations in a safe, orderly way over a reasonable period of time.252\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* T-PER 03706.\n\n185.\n\nMr. Wong Loon, President of OCP Ecuador S.A., responded to Perenco\u2019s letter on 26 May 2009. Mr. Wong Loon stated that upon Perenco\u2019s request it had sought to clarify with the Enforcement Court of Petroecuador \"if the *Orden de Embargo* was valid and outstanding\" in light of the Tribunal\u2019s decision. He stated further that \"[t]he Enforcement Court of Petroecuador through notice dated 21 May 2009 and served to OCP Ecuador S.A. on 25 May 2009... has responded to OCP Ecuador S.A. that the *Orden de Embargo* issued on 3 March 2009 affecting Perenco Ecuador Limited\u2019s production and shipments has not been modified.\"253 He further notified Perenco that the Transportation Agreement between OCP Ecuador S.A. and Perenco Ecuador Limited, dated 30 January 2011, had been affected by a continuing \" *Force Majeure Event* caused by a Political Event [which] occurred on March 3, 2009.\"254\n\nExhibit CE-214, Letter with attachments from OCP Ecuador to Perenco regarding redelivery of crude oil, 26 May 2009 (attachments in Spanish with English translation), PER 03701;

According to Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, Minister Pinto maintained Ecuador\u2019s position that in order to cease the *coactivas,* the Consortium would have to agree to pay all outstanding Law 42 amounts under a payment plan (amongst other conditions).264 Perenco did not agree to this.265\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 121.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 122.\n\n193.\n\nMr. M\u00e1rquez then wrote to Minister Pinto on 2 July 2009, referring to the 25 June 2009 meeting and the terms communicated to Perenco. Mr. M\u00e1rquez stated that Perenco was not in a position to offer to \"pay off the amounts in dispute as a condition for lifting the enforcement measure and suspending the auction\"266, adding that:\n\n\"... the most prudent thing would be to suspend the auction of crude oil from Blocks 7 and 21, scheduled for July 3rd, and to lift the enforcement measures, in compliance with stipulations of the decisions regarding the injunctions. That way, we would be able to return to relative operational normality at Blocks 7 and 21, and minimal conditions would be created to facilitate a dialogue and the possibility of a negotiated resolution to this conflict.\"267\n\nExhibit CE-222, Letter from Perenco to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum regarding lifting the enforcement measures, 2 July 2009 (in Spanish with English translation), T-PER 03747.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n194.\n\nMr. M\u00e1rquez reaffirmed that Perenco was desirous to continue \"pursuing and making room for dialogue.\"268\n\n*Ibid.,* T-PER 03748.\n\n195.\n\nPetroecuador proceeded with the auction of the Consortium\u2019s crude on 3 July 2009. The Respondent maintains that Perenco threatened legal action against any company who stepped forward to submit a bid in the auction of its oil.269 A press release by Perenco on 3 July 2009 quotes a statement by Mr. M\u00e1rquez, the Latin American Regional Manager of the Perenco Group, that \"[a]nyone who purchases the seized crude oil under the circumstances is buying property that Ecuador and Petroecuador are not entitled to sell...[c]onsequently, anyone who buys at the Government auction may be liable for conversion or other misdeeds\" and \"Perenco is prepared to enforce its rights wherever it becomes necessary to do so.\"270 Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9 testified that this was not intended as a threat, and attributed the subsequent lack of external bidders at the auction to the fact that \"buyers were aware of the situation and that the crude belonging to Perenco seized was under [sic] Provisional Measures from the Tribunal.\"271 Under cross-examination, however, Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9 acknowledged that the press release may have been treated as a threat by potential buyers, or at the least \"inform[ing] all buyers that [it] would - [it] could take legal action against them.\"272 Since there were no bidders, Petroecuador purchased the full volume of oil offered at a 50% discount to the market price, thereafter crediting these sales against Perenco\u2019s alleged Law 42 \u2018debt\u2019 at the measured-at-the auction price.273\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, pp 315-316 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nExhibit E-57, \"Perenco Will Protect Its Rights in Ecuadorian Oil Seized in Defiance of International Arbitration Tribunal Orders,\" PR Newswire, London, 3 July 2009.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 3, pp 616- 619 (Testimony of Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 3, pp 620-621 (Testimony of Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9).\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 124; Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 240 and 244; see Exhibits E-92, Table -Auctions Block 7, p 2 (see Auction No. 1, dated 3 July 2009) and E-93, Table - Auctions Block 21, p 3 (see Auction No. 1, dated 3 July 2009); cf.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 CLAIMS AND RELIEFS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n**(1) Whether Perenco is a company \u2018controlled by\u2019 French nationals within the meaning of Article l(3)(ii) of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nArticle 1(3) of the Treaty defines \"companies\" which have standing to claim under the Treaty as:\n\n(i) Any body corporate constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation and having its registered office there,\n\n(ii) *Any body corporate controlled by nationals of one Contracting Party* or by bodies corporate having their registered office in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and constituted in accordance with that Party\u2019s legislation.308\n\nExhibit CE-7, Treaty, PER 00520 [Emphasis added.].\n\n217.\n\nPerenco submitted that it was at all relevant times controlled by French nationals. Thus, it is a French company for the purposes of the Treaty and consequently has the requisite standing to bring a claim regarding alleged breaches of the Treaty by the Respondent.309\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 14. Exhibit CE-6 to the Amended Request identifies Hubert Perrodo on the register of members of Perenco Gabon S.A. (formerly, Perenco S.A. and the sole shareholder in Perenco), holding 90,498 shares.\n\n218.\n\nEcuador submitted that Perenco bears the burden of establishing this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione personae* pursuant to the ICSID Convention and the Treaty, and has failed to do so.310 It stressed that, to succeed, Perenco had to prove that it was directly controlled by Mr. Hubert Perrodo\u2019s heirs on both the date on which consent to arbitration is purported to be effected (17 October 2007) as well as on the date on which the Request for Arbitration was registered by the Centre (4 June 2008).311 It contended that on each of those dates Perenco was not controlled by the heirs of the late Mr. Perrodo within the meaning of Article 1 (3)(ii).312\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 27-32.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 24.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n219.\n\nEcuador\u2019s argument in this regard was two-fold.\n\n220.\n\nFirst, Ecuador asserted that the Treaty required legal control and that at the relevant dates, no Perrodo heir had the legal capacity to control the ultimate parent company of Perenco Ecuador Limited, namely, PIL.313 This was because the shares in that company were not transferred to Mr. Perrodo\u2019s heirs in accordance with Bahamian law until 22 December 2011, well after the two dates previously noted.314\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 26-33.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 26-31.\n\n221.\n\nEcuador asserted further that the relevant test was whether the heirs individually or collectively had the legal capacity to control Perenco on the relevant dates, particularly the critical date of 17 October 2007 (the date on which consent to ICSID arbitration was purported to be given).315 Ecuador argued that they did not and that Mr. Perrodo died intestate, and consequently, after his death on 29 December 2006, his estate, consisting of his shares in PIL, was left un-administered until 19 August 2009 when letters of administration were formally granted by the Bahamian courts.316 On the basis that Bahamian law, not French law, governs the transmission of shares, the Perrodo heirs had, at best, an equitable interest in the shares in PIL until such time as they were legally registered as owners of the shares. This could only be achieved after the letters of administration had been granted.317\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 34-43.\n\nCounter-Menrorial, paragraphs 38-39, 59-61, 85.\n\nCounter-Menrorial, paragraphs 69-71.\n\n222.\n\nPending such registration and transfer of shares, the Articles of Association of Perenco did not permit the heirs of the late Mr. Perrodo to exercise any rights in relation to the corporate governance of PIL, including voting. Accordingly, on 17 October 2007, no Perrodo, let alone Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, was vested with the legal capacity to control PIL (and, through that parent company, Perenco Ecuador Limited).318\n\nCounter-Menrorial, paragraph 40. The Respondent also referred to Article 27 of the Articles of Association of PIL which provides that \"the *executor or administrator of a deceased member,* the guardian of an incompetent member or the trustee of a bankrupt member shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any title to its share\" [Emphasis added.]. See also, Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 42-98.\n\n223.\n\nPerenco challenged this position as legally and factually incorrect. It cited several cases which in its submission demonstrate the flexible approach taken by tribunals and which emphasise that different criterion may be employed to find control, this not necessarily limited to legal capacity to control.319 It argued that the undisputed facts establish that the Perrodo family controlled Perenco in every way significant for the purposes of the term \"controlled\" under Article l(3)(ii) of the Treaty.320 It argued that this control was manifested in formal and informal means.321 The Perrodo family was in fact in control of the Perenco Group both when Hubert Perrodo was alive and after his death.322 Moreover, at the date of consent to arbitration, the Perrodo heirs collectively owned 100% of the shares in PIL under French law and this was sufficient to establish \"control\" over the company (and through that, its wholly-owned subsidiary).323\n\nReply, paragraphs 66-79.\n\nReply, paragraph 73.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nReply, paragraphs 73 -79.\n\nReply, paragraphs 80-89.\n\n224.\n\nPerenco asserted that even if the Tribunal were to proceed on the narrow approach to control advocated by Ecuador, Perenco was nevertheless legally controlled by French nationals as of 17 October 2007 because approximately 7.1 % of the shares in PIL were owned by Glenmor Energy, which in turn, was wholly owned by Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo.324\n\nReply, paragraphs 90-98.\n\n225.\n\nPerenco emphasised that Ecuador has repeatedly and consistently referred to and treated it as a French company.325 It argued that under ICSID jurisprudence on Article 25(2)(b), the host State\u2019s awareness of the objective fact of control is one of the factors taken into consideration when determining \"foreign control\".326\n\nReply, paragraphs 99-104.\n\nReply, paragraphs 102-103.\n\n226.\n\nEcuador\u2019s second point was that Article l(3)(ii) of the Treaty required \"direct\" control.327 It asserted that according to Bahamian law, the Perrodo heirs were not capable of exercising direct control over PIL (and through that, Perenco) at the critical date because they were not shareholders of that company. The Contracting Parties intended that the term \"control\" refer only to \"direct control\" because in negotiating the Treaty they chose to remove the phrase \"directly or indirectly\" contained in prior drafts of the Treaty, while simultaneously incorporating it elsewhere in order to expand the scope of the definition of \"investment\" under the Treaty.328\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 91-129.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 33, 99-137.\n\n227.\n\nEcuador contended that \"it [was] entirely reasonable to suppose that having taken steps to protect the indirect investments of nationals of a State party, the Contracting Parties did not believe that they then needed to provide additional protection to those same investments by expanding the scope of the persons who have standing to bring treaty claims.\"329 It submitted that regardless of what the Tribunal interprets to be the plain and ordinary meaning of the term \"control\" in Article 1 (3)(ii) of the Treaty, it should have regard to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty which, in its view, clearly indicate that the parties\u2019 intention was not to extend the scope of the term to indirect control, but rather to restrict it to direct control.330\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 111 and 125.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 129.\n\n228.\n\nPerenco submitted in turn that Ecuador\u2019s argument that the use of the word \"controlled\" in Article l(3)(ii) of the Treaty must be read to mean \"controlled directly\" should be rejected because it was refuted by the plain language of the Treaty, by pertinent components of its *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires,* and by prior investment treaty jurisprudence.331 In Perenco\u2019s view, the term \"controlled\" encompassed both direct and indirect forms of control.332 It asserted that Ecuador has not offered the Tribunal one citation of a dictionary definition of the term which defined it as limited to \"direct control\".333 Indeed, the definitions proffered confirm that the ordinary meaning of control encompassed both direct and indirect forms of control.334\n\nReply, paragraph 9.\n\nReply, paragraphs 18-20.\n\nReply, paragraphs 21-26.\n\nReply, paragraphs 21 and 23.\n\n229.\n\nMoreover, Perenco averred that recourse to the *travaux* was inappropriate when the text of the Treaty was unambiguous (which it submitted was the case here).335 In the event that the Tribunal determined it was necessary to consult the *travaux,* Perenco maintained that the drafting history of the Treaty confirmed the broad meaning of the word \"controlled\".336 The *travaux* demonstrated that a proposal to limit the definition of a company \"to all juridical persons *controlled directly* by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties\" was notably rejected by the Contracting Parties.337\n\nReply, paragraph 28.\n\nReply, paragraphs 27-51.\n\nReply, paragraphs 31-40 [Italics in original].\n\n**(2) Whether claims relating to** ***Caducidad*** **are arbitrable**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nEcuador objected to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to consider the claims relating to *caducidad* and, alternatively, the admissibility of such claims.338\n\nCounter-Menrorial, paragraphs 340-367.\n\n231.\n\nFirst, Ecuador submitted that disputes relating to *caducidad* are not arbitrable under Ecuadorian Law. Ecuador relied on the evidence of its expert, Professor Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, to submit that under Ecuadorian law a dispute may be submitted to arbitration only if it is of a contractual nature.339 The declaration of *caducidad* was an administrative act, carrying a presumption of legality under Ecuadorian law and challengeable only before Ecuadorian courts (as per Article 173 of Ecuador\u2019s Constitution).340\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 181-183; Rejoinder, paragraphs 154-155.\n\nCounter-Menrorial, paragraph 346; Rejoinder, paragraphs 157-158.\n\n232.\n\nPerenco rejected this argument, submitting that if it were accepted Ecuador would effectively have used its domestic law to evade its Treaty obligation to submit all legal disputes regarding investments to ICSID arbitration.341 In any event, supported by the evidence of its expert Dr. H\u00e9man P\u00e9rez Loose, it submitted that Ecuadorian law does not preclude arbitration of *caducidad-rdate\u00e1* disputes because Article 173 of Ecuador\u2019s Constitution provides only that administrative acts *may* be challenged before the Ecuadorian acts, and not that this is the exclusive forum.342\n\nReply, paragraphs 108-113, reference to *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Jurisdiction (9 September 2008) (\" *Occidental II (Jurisdiction)\").*\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, p 1533 (Testimony of H\u00e9man P\u00e9rez Loose). Ecuador\u2019s rebuttal is found at paragraph 160 of its Rejoinder. It states that the terms of Article 173 of the Constitution indicate it does not intend a choice of forum because it allegedly uses the term \"can\" rather than \"may\".\n\n233.\n\nSecond, Ecuador asserted that the parties to the Participation Contracts expressly carved *caducidad* out of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal.343 It referred to clauses 21.3 and 21.4 of the Block 7 Contract and clause 20.2 and Annex XVI of the Block 21 Contract,344 and submitted that since \"the motive for declaration of *caducidad...* was legal and did not arise out of a disagreement of a technical or economic character\" it fell strictly outside these provisions.345\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 360.\n\nExhibit E-58, Annex XVI (Resubmitted on 11-17-09). Annex XVI provides that \"the Parties agree that any technical and/or economic dispute arising out of the application of the Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon Region, which is the object of the present Contract, shall be resolved according to the provisions of the aforementioned Convention.\" (Unofficial translation of Spanish original: [L]as *Partes acuerdan que toda disputa t\u00e9cnico y/o econ\u00f3mica derivada de la aplicaci\u00f3n del Contrato de Participaci\u00f3n para la Exploraci\u00f3n y Explotaci\u00f3n de Hidrocarburos en el Bloque 21 de la Amazonia, que es materia del presente Contrato, se resolver\u00e1 de acuerdo con las estipulaciones establecidas en el antedicho Convenido.\").*\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 345-355, 360; Rejoinder, paragraphs 167-190.\n\n234.\n\nPerenco responded that these provisions set out the procedure that should be followed by a party in terminating the contract based on different grounds. They did not exclude the submission of *caducidad-r* elated claims to arbitration, nor did they require the submission of *caducidad-r* elated claims exclusively to Ecuadorian courts.346\n\nReply, paragraphs 127-136.\n\n235.\n\nPerenco also argued that the issue was not whether a *caducidad-rdate\u00e1* claim was \"legal\" but whether it was \"related to technical or economic aspects.\"347 It characterised the declaration of *caducidad* as an \"inseparable element of Ecuador\u2019s coercive conduct against Perenco\" which gave rise to a dispute concerning key provisions relating to the sharing of economic benefits under the Contracts.348\n\nReply, paragraph 147.\n\nReply, paragraphs 148-149.\n\n236.\n\nPerenco submitted that only an explicit and unambiguous waiver of its right to submit to ICSID arbitration could bar such claims and that none of the provisions in the Participation Contracts qualified.349\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 153-154; Reply, paragraphs 128-143.\n\n237.\n\nLastly, Ecuador submitted that the claims relating to *caducidad* were premature because Perenco did not seek redress from administrative courts in Ecuador in respect of the same.350 Perenco responded it could not proceed before administrative courts in Ecuador because of the Tribunal\u2019s direction in its Decision on Provisional Measures that the Parties refrain from resorting to \"domestic courts of Ecuador to enforce or resist any claim...\".351\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 362-367; Reply, paragraphs 163-173.\n\nReply, paragraph 164.\n\n**B. Merits**\n-------------\n\n**(1) Introduction to the claims under the Treaty and the Participation Contracts**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nPerenco submitted that Ecuador through Law 42, the Implementing Regulations, the *coactivas* and seizure of its crude, intervention in the Blocks and declaration of *caducidad* breached its obligations under Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the Treaty, and the Participation Contracts.352\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 3 3.\n\n239.\n\nAt paragraph 2 of its Revised Memorial, Perenco explained that:\n\nWielding Law 42, Ecuador not only eviscerated fundamental terms of the Participation Contracts, but in doing so turned what in all other respects was a highly profitable business into one that, in 2008 - despite record oil prices -generated a loss of nearly $63 million, and at the same time took for itself hundreds of millions of dollars that it was not entitled to under the Contracts. Respondent\u2019s actions also cost Perenco millions of dollars in foregone profits that Perenco would have earned if not for the enactment and enforcement of Law 42.353\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 2.\n\n240.\n\nFor its part, Ecuador framed the enactment and application of Law 42 in very different terms:\n\nLaw 42 - together with the *Ley de Equidad Tributaria -* represented a legitimate means for Ecuador to achieve a major public policy goal of both re-establishing the economic equilibrium of its participation contracts (including the Participation Contracts) which had been disrupted by massive and unforeseen oil price increases, and opening discussions with the oil companies operating in Ecuador with a view to agreeing upon more adapted economic models in light of the new oil-market price order prevailing since the mid-2000s. These measures were accordingly taken by Ecuador in accordance with its duty to seek a fair allocation of the petroleum rent between the oil companies operating in Ecuador and the public.354\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 14.\n\n241.\n\nEcuador asserted that in response to escalating oil prices and the prospect of windfall profits, \"most, if not all major producing oil countries in a comparable position to Ecuador [had] taken measures similar to Law 42 to maintain the economic stability of their concession contracts since 2002.\"355 An international tribunal could not hold a State liable for economic injury which was the consequence of *bona fide* regulation within its police powers.356 The power to tax was a sovereign power within the category of a State\u2019s police powers, and neither customary international law nor the Treaty recognized any limitations on this power.357\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 15-16.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 545-547.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 546-548.\n\n242.\n\nLastly, Ecuador maintained that the events following the enactment of Law 42 and complained of by Perenco (i.e., *coactivas,* intervention in the Blocks and *caducidad)* were triggered by Perenco\u2019s own illegal conduct.358 For example, the *coactiva* process was initiated in response to Perenco\u2019s failure to pay its Law 42 dues.359 Thus, Perenco should be barred from claiming compensation in relation to these claims.360\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 559, 563-567.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 559.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**(2) Whether Ecuador breached Article 4 of the Treaty by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to Perenco\u2019s investment in Blocks 7 and 21**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nPerenco submitted that Ecuador breached Article 4 of the Treaty obliging it to accord Perenco\u2019s investment in Blocks 7 and 21 fair and equitable treatment and to refrain from interfering with the use and enjoyment of Perenco's investments.361 It asserted that its basic expectations as largely set forth in the Participation Contracts were that its participation was tied exclusively to the volume of production it generated, thereby isolating it from oil price fluctuations, and Ecuador agreed not to upset this commercial bargain by making drastic changes to participation percentages in response to price fluctuations in the global market.362\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 34.\n\n*Ibid.-,* Revised Memorial, paragraphs 156-159, 169; Reply, paragraph 282 (\"Ecuador thus deliberately created an environment in which a contractor could expect that it would operate under a production sharing model where the economic benefit was allocated between the contractor and the State based on an agreed percentage of production, that the contractor would not be unilaterally and coercively forced to abandon this model for a less profitable services contract, and that any disputes over such economic matters would be peaceably resolved through binding international arbitration.\")\n\n244.\n\nPerenco submitted that Ecuador undermined this expectation by enacting and enforcing Law 42.363 This was compounded by the raising of the percentage of revenues demanded by Law 42 to 99% on 4 October 2007.364\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 167; Reply, paragraphs 287-290.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 167; Reply, paragraph 290.\n\n245.\n\nPerenco argued that it had a reasonable expectation that the Participation Contracts would not be amended given their clause 15.2 which required the prior agreement of the parties for any amendments.365 It relied on this understanding when it chose to put enormous capital at risk in Ecuador.366 In this connection, Perenco asserted that when it sought in good faith to negotiate with Ecuador, Ecuador responded inflexibly and unpredictably, ignoring its obligation to negotiate a correction factor and to abide by the Decision on Provisional Measures and further threatening to take legal action against its employees or expel them.367\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 160-161; Exhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04829 and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04703.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 159.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 164 and 169; Reply, paragraphs 297-300, 309.\n\n246.\n\nPerenco further contended that it had a legitimate expectation that disputes regarding the investment would be \"resolved peaceably through an international arbitration process at ICSID.\"368 Ecuador\u2019s defiance of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures was unfair and inequitable.369\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 163.\n\nReply, paragraphs 297-300.\n\n247.\n\nPerenco maintained that Ecuador\u2019s actions in direct contravention of its legitimate expectations effectively removed a substantial portion of revenue to which it was entitled and rendered its investment in Blocks 7 and 21 commercially unviable.370\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 34.\n\n248.\n\nEcuador for its part challenged whether the \"legitimate expectation\" as articulated by Perenco was consistent with the terms of the Participation Contracts.371 It submitted that Law 42 could not modify the Participation Contracts because on a strict reading of its terms it did not affect the participation in volume of oil that Perenco was entitled to receive.372 The Participation Contracts did not guarantee Perenco a right to a given revenue stream, let alone substantial profits.373 Thus, Perenco had failed to prove that Law 42 affected the economy of the Contracts and that a correction factor to the Consortium\u2019s participation should have been negotiated.374\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 465. At paragraphs 272-276 of its Reply, Perenco argued in turn that Ecuador improperly contends that its Treaty obligation of fair and equitable treatment is bounded by the terms of the Participation Contracts.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 24 and 469.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 469-470.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 464-484.\n\n**(3) Whether Ecuador breached Article 4 of the Treaty by interfering with Perenco\u2019s use and enjoyment of its investment in Blocks 7 and 21**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nIn addition, Perenco submitted that Ecuador breached Article 4 of the Treaty by interfering with the management, use, enjoyment and transfer of its investment in Blocks 7 and 21.\n\n250.\n\nPerenco\u2019s submission was that as a result of Law 42, the Implementing Regulations and Ecuador\u2019s actions in relation thereto, it was progressively denied the various attributes of management, use and enjoyment of its investment, namely, its exploitation of the Blocks, production and sale of crude, further investment in additional wells and infrastructure, and profits thereof.375\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 176; Reply, paragraphs 328-337.\n\n251.\n\nEcuador rejected this claim. It submitted that the Participation Contracts did not preclude the State from enacting and enforcing Law 42 and Perenco could not claim that the events subsequent to the enactment of Law 42 and the termination of the Participation Contracts interfered with the use and enjoyment of its investments as Ecuador was acting to enforce its domestic law, and was responding to Perenco\u2019s own illegal action.376\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 495-502. The Claimant at paragraphs 329-336 of its Reply submitted in turn that Ecuador had conflated its rebuttal to the claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment with that of breach of the obligation not to impede or impair the investor\u2019s right to manage, use and enjoy with respect to its investment; that there was in its view no breach of the terms of the Participation Contracts. Perenco submitted that the latter obligation is distinct from the obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment, and that the observance of contractual obligations (which Perenco disputed occurred in its case) was not a sufficient answer.\n\n**(4) Whether Ecuador breached Article 5 of the Treaty by acting discriminatorily with regard to Perenco and its investment in Blocks 7 and 21**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nArticle 5 of the Treaty requires Ecuador to accord to nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party in respect of their investments and activities in connection with such investments, the same treatment as is accorded to its own nationals or companies, or the treatment accorded to nationals or companies of the most-favoured nation.377\n\nExhibit CE-7, Treaty, PER 00520.\n\n253.\n\nPerenco initially submitted that Law 42 was \"openly designed\" to target the contracts of foreign companies and that was descriptive of both its intent and effect.378 Ecuador in its Counter-Memorial argued that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to determine this claim because Article 5 of the Treaty excludes its application to matters of taxation, such as Law 42 and the actions taken by Ecuador to enforce it.379\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 181.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 11, 505, 507-512.\n\n254.\n\nPerenco subsequently abandoned this claim, stating in its Reply at paragraph 5 that:\n\nIn the interests of efficiency, Perenco will not advance further its claim that Ecuador also violated the most favored nation and national treatment provisions of Article 5 of the Treaty on the basis that Law 42 and its enforcement discriminated against Perenco. Perenco takes this position in light of the fact that Article 5 says that \u2018[t]he provisions of this article shall not apply to taxation matters,\u2019 and the decision on jurisdiction issued by the tribunal in *Burlington v.* *Ecuador* to the effect that Law 42 should fall within the carve-out in the U.S.-Ecuador Treaty for matters of taxation. See *Burlington* (Jurisdiction), EL-109, \u00b6\u00b6 164-167. Perenco does not accept that the *Burlington* tribunal\u2019s analysis is necessarily correct or binding on this Tribunal, but, to simplify this proceeding, *it is prepared not to pursue its distinct claim for violation of Article 5 of the Treaty.* *The discriminatory intent and effect of Ecuador \u2019s conduct nevertheless remains* *relevant to Ecuador\u2019s obligations under other Treaty provisions, including Article 4, as well as to Ecuador\u2019s contractual obligations, as discussed below.*380\n\nReply, paragraph 5 [Emphasis added.].\n\n255.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant raised an alternative submission in the context of a contractual undertaking under clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Participation Contract not to discriminate between Contractors operating in Ecuador on participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons.381 Due to the contractual nature of this claim, it is described below at paragraphs 272 and 276.\n\nReply, paragraphs 496-501; cf. Rejoinder, paragraphs 426-428.\n\n**(5) Whether Ecuador breached Article 6 of the Treaty by expropriating Perenco\u2019s investment in Blocks 7 and 21**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nPerenco submitted that the cumulative effect of Ecuador\u2019s measures, beginning with its enactment of Law 42 (which essentially deprived Perenco of the key terms of Perenco\u2019s investment, namely the opportunity to earn profits),382 the enforcement of Law 42 through its seizure and sale of Perenco\u2019s crude, its physical take-over of the Blocks and unilaterally declaring *caducidad,* resulted in a \"complete taking of Perenco\u2019s assets\" in breach of Article 6 of the Treaty.383 Ecuador has also failed to comply with the requirements of Article 6 in that it has not put forward any public necessity justification for its actions and has not paid nor offered to pay any compensation.384\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 192.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 194; Reply, paragraphs 354-374.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 195; Reply, paragraphs 390-396, 406-411.\n\n257.\n\nPerenco submitted that a measure is expropriatory \"when it leads to a substantial deprivation or effectively renders useless an investor\u2019s property rights.\"385 Relying on *Alpha Projecktholding* v. *Ukraine,* Perenco asserted that a \"government action need not amount to an outright seizure or transfer of title in order to amount to an expropriation under international law\", in this way laying foundation for its submission that the actions of a State which deprive an investor of acquired contractual rights can be expropriatory.386 In this light, Perenco maintained that \"when a State exercise[d] its public authority unilaterally to amend the key terms of a contract with an investor, with the effect of essentially depriving the investor of the contractor\u2019s benefits, such a repudiation of acquired contract rights constitute[d] a measure tantamount to expropriation.\"387\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 189.\n\n*Ibid.',* citing paragraph 408 of CA-281, *Alpha Projecktholding GMBH v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award (8 November 2010).\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 191.\n\n258.\n\nPerenco submitted that Ecuador could not excuse its conduct by arguing that Law 42 was a legitimate exercise of its sovereign rights to regulate the use of its natural resources or that its actions were permitted under Ecuadorian law.388 Moreover, the fact that Perenco was prepared to make disputed payments into an escrow account, and that it moved to suspend operations in the Blocks, was immaterial to the analysis of its claim as these were \"justifiable and proportionate responses to Ecuador\u2019s prior expropriatory acts.\"389\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 196-197.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 198.\n\n259.\n\nEcuador responded by first stressing that Perenco has failed to discharge its burden of proving how the enforcement by the State of a law legitimately enacted and declared constitutional by its highest court was expropriatory.390\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 20, 569-649.\n\n260.\n\nIts argument in support was two-fold.\n\n261.\n\nFirst, Ecuador submitted that Law 42, the *coactiva* process, Ecuador\u2019s temporary take-over of the Blocks and *caducidad* were all *bona fide* and legitimate exercises of Ecuador\u2019s police powers and did not constitute an expropriation under international law.391 Ecuador contended that, in this regard, international tribunals have consistently held that taxation measures, being one of the most important attributes of sovereignty, are permitted under international law without creating a duty to compensate.392 The presumption of validity or legitimacy of a State\u2019s regulatory interference was not easy to overturn and States had a wide discretion in the exercise of their regulatory functions under domestic law.393 Citing *Paushok v. Mongolia,* Ecuador submitted that Perenco could only succeed if it proved that \"Law 42 was discriminatory, arbitrary in its incidence, abusive in its purpose or involved denial of due process.\"394\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 544.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 546-550.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 550.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 550-551; *Sergei Paushok, CSJC Golden East Company, CISC Vostokneftegaz, Company v. The Government of Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability (28 April 2011), paragraph 321 (EL-103).\n\n262.\n\nEcuador described Law 42 as a *bona fide* exercise of police powers pursuant to its \"[c]onstitutional mandate to seek a fair allocation of the revenues derived from its hydrocarbons\" and, in this way, intended \"to remedy a disequilibrium caused by a massive and unforeseen increase in oil prices\" which resulted in oil companies making windfall profits.395 In this connection, Ecuador submitted that Law 42 was duly enacted in accordance with the requisite procedure under Ecuadorian law and its constitutionality was upheld by the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court.396\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 557; cf. Reply, paragraphs 378-388.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n263.\n\nSimilarly, the events following the enactment of Law 42 were legitimate responses to Perenco\u2019s own illegal conduct. The *coactiva* process was a normal exercise of Ecuador\u2019s public powers to collect unpaid taxes and levies when Perenco unilaterally stopped paying its dues.397 It temporarily intervened in Blocks 7 and 21 because Perenco unilaterally suspended operations in these Blocks, an action which in Ecuador\u2019s view, was the product of what it termed a \"self-expropriation\" strategy.398 In the face of Perenco\u2019s intransigence in refusing to resume operations of the Blocks and the risk of damage in the Blocks, Ecuador had to continue to operate the Blocks and undertake proceedings to declare *caducidad* of the Participation Contracts.399\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 559.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 22, 559, 563-568.\n\n264.\n\nEcuador further averred in this regard that Perenco had a duty to engage in contractual renegotiations in order to restore the economic equilibrium of the Participation Contracts, but failed to do so when it was unable to secure the agreement of its consortium partner, Burlington.400\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 558.\n\n265.\n\nSecond, Ecuador submitted that Law 42 and the actions of the State to enforce it did not permanently deprive Perenco of its investment. It argued that the burden of proof is on Perenco and the fact that Law 42 did not amend key terms of the Participation Contracts and a stabilisation clause was not provided for means there can be no breach of contract and consequently, no repudiation of Perenco\u2019s contractual rights.401 Perenco has failed to show that Law 42 deprived it of any of its contractual rights.402\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 570-576.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n266.\n\nEcuador submitted in the alternative that if the Tribunal were to find that Law 42 was in breach of the Participation Contracts, it was not a breach that amounted to an expropriation within Article 6.403 A breach (or breaches) of a contract can only amount to an expropriation if the investor is thereby deprived of the contract\u2019s benefits.404 Ecuador argued that, in contrast, Perenco\u2019s submission was the mere allegation, \"without any true economic analysis\", that Law 42 deprived it of a key term of the Participation Contracts and consequently the benefit of its investment.405\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 579.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 580.\n\n267.\n\nFinally, Ecuador maintained that, in any event, Law 42, whether at 50% or 99%, did not amount to an expropriation.406\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 591-652.\n\n268.\n\nAt 50%, Law 42 did not render the investment worthless, and this was supported by the fact that tax returns for Blocks 7 and 21 for the fiscal years of 2006 and 2007 indicate Perenco continued to derive significant profits from its investments in Ecuador.407 Ecuador further pointed to the 1st Fair Links report to support its contention that Law 42 at 50% in April 2006 preserved Perenco\u2019s initial expectations of return on its investment.408 As for Law 42 at 99%, Ecuador submitted that this too was not expropriatory because it did not adversely affect the \"reasonable profit\" that Perenco could have expected to receive, using the reference price on which the negotiation of the Participation Contracts was based (US $ 15/bbl).409 Law 42 at 99% continued to apply only to the share of extraordinary revenue that Perenco was receiving.410\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 594-597.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 598; 1st Expert Report of Fair Links, paragraphs 97-104.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 629-637.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**(6) Whether Ecuador breached contractual undertakings not to unilaterally amend key terms of the Participation Contracts, not to discriminate and to negotiate**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nPerenco submitted that Law 42 and its enforcement had the effect of unilaterally amending key terms of the Contracts (including but not limited to clause 8.1) in breach of the Contracts\u2019 provisions on modification.411\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 3 7 ; Revised Memorial, paragraphs 201-211.\n\n270.\n\nPerenco argued that by applying Law 42 Ecuador breached the *pacta sunt servanda* principle governing the Contracts pursuant to Article 1561 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code and/or a specific provision in the Contracts regarding requirements for its amendment.412 This was because Law 42 had the effect of unilaterally amending key terms of the Contracts.413 Moreover, the Contracts required Perenco and Ecuador to negotiate a correction factor in the event measures taken by the State upset the economy of the Contracts.414 This was not done.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 201, 208 and 211.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 201-211.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 220; Reply, paragraphs 461-495.\n\n271.\n\nPerenco contended further that the Contracts required the parties to negotiate if the law applicable to the contract was amended.415 Perenco relied on clause 22.1 of the Participation Contracts, the governing law clause, which stated that \"laws in force at the time of its execution are understood to be incorporated in it.\"416\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 217-219.\n\n*Ibid,* Exhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, Clause 22.1 (PER 04858), and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, Clause 22.1 (PER 04722)\n\n272.\n\nFinally, Perenco averred that by exempting the application of Law 42 to another contractor operating in Ecuador, Andes Petroleum, Ecuador breached its contractual undertaking in clause 5.1.28 not to discriminate between \"Participation Contractors for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons\".417\n\nReply, paragraphs 496-501. Clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Participation Contract provided \"The Parties understand that the treatment received by the Contractor both by the Government of Ecuador as well as by PETROECUADOR shall not be less favorable than that in similar conditions by other Participation Contractors for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons.\" (See Exhibit CE-17, PER 04772)\n\n273.\n\nEcuador responded that the only guarantee that the Contracts offered to Perenco was \"participation\" in the form of an entitlement to a physical share in the oil produced.418 Perenco could not reasonably claim a guarantee of gross income under the terms of the Contracts.419\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 394-395.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n274.\n\nEcuador similarly rejected Perenco\u2019s claim in relation to the triggering of the renegotiation clause in the Contracts. It submitted that it was not triggered because Law 42 did not upset the economy of the Contracts.420 Ecuador submitted that Perenco has failed to discharge its burden of demonstrating that Law 42 had an impact on the economy of the Participation Contracts, and what the appropriate adjustment would have been.421\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 409, 412-421.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 409, 412, 422-424.\n\n275.\n\nEcuador denied any suggestion by Perenco that clause 22.1 operates as a stabilisation clause.422 Rather, clause 22.1 must be read as providing that that the Contracts are governed by Ecuadorian legislation in force at the relevant time, in addition to laws which were in force at the time the Participation Contracts were concluded.423\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 397.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 397-398.\n\n276.\n\nFinally, Ecuador challenged the claim regarding the alleged breach of clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Contract as raised \"far too late\", requesting that it be dismissed.424 It was raised for the first time by the Claimant in its Reply; it was not canvassed in its Request, Memorial or Revised Memorial. Ecuador argued that, in any event, Perenco has failed to discharge its burden of proving that Perenco and Andes Petroleum were in \"similar conditions\" (the term in clause 5.1.28), that there was no justification for differing treatment, and that there was an intention to favour Andes Petroleum.425\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 426-427.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 529-533; Rejoinder, paragraphs 426-428.\n\n**(7) Whether Ecuador was contractually bound to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nIn its Amended Request for Arbitration dated 30 April 2008, Perenco sought provisional measures requesting the Tribunal to enjoin Ecuador from pursuing any action to collect any payments that Ecuador claimed Perenco owed as a result of Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations, and from unilaterally amending, rescinding, terminating or repudiating the Participation Contracts or any of its terms.426 The chain of events that followed, leading up to and including the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures of 8 May 2009, are set out in detail in the Statement of Facts at Section III. F.\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 43.\n\n278.\n\nPerenco submitted that Ecuador\u2019s \"actions in defiance of the Tribunal\u2019s Provisional Measures order\" formed an independent breach of the Participation Contracts\u2019 terms with respect to the agreement to arbitrate and the parties\u2019 submission to the decisions of the Tribunal.427\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 222-226; Reply, paragraphs 246-253.\n\n279.\n\nEcuador, in response, submitted that any such failure to abide by the Tribunal\u2019s recommendation of provisional measures did not as a matter of Ecuadorian law violate the contractual obligations invoked by Perenco.428 In the alternative, Ecuador argued that its actions were not causative of any loss suffered by Perenco.429\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 426-451.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**C. Ecuador\u2019s Counterclaims**\n------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Ecuador has filed a counterclaim in which it claims that the effect of Perenco\u2019s actions, in alleged breach of its obligations under Ecuadorian environmental law, resulted in significant environmental damage to Blocks 7 and 21, and amounted to a failure to properly maintain the Blocks\u2019 infrastructure in good working condition.430\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 26, 653-962.\n\n281.\n\nFor the purposes of this Decision, it is unnecessary to recount the substance of Ecuador\u2019s counterclaims and Perenco\u2019s responses thereto as the Parties agreed to a separate briefing schedule and hearing. Accordingly, the Tribunal will not record the parties\u2019 submissions as they stand any further in this Decision. The counterclaims will be addressed by the Tribunal in a separate decision to be issued in due course.\n\n**D. Remedies**\n---------------\n\n282.\n\nPerenco claimed full reparation in respect of its claims and to monetary damages in lieu of restitution in kind.431 The award of monetary damages should include Law 42 amounts that Perenco paid under protest, revenues from oil seized by Ecuador by means of the *coactivas,* profit from foregone investments that Perenco would have made but for the implementation of Law 42, the present value of future profits from the Participation Contracts and any extensions thereof, the costs and expenses that arose from the expropriation of Perenco\u2019s property, the costs of this arbitration and compound interest at commercial rates on all amounts.432\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 249-256.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 256; Reply, paragraph 511.\n\n283.\n\nEcuador submitted that the Tribunal should find that it lacks jurisdiction over the claims in their entirety or over particular claims. In the alternative, Ecuador argued that Perenco has failed to discharge its burden of proof in respect of its claims under the Contracts and the Treaty, and that in any event the claims fail on their merits.433\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 964-979, 982.\n\n284.\n\nAs noted, Ecuador forwarded two counterclaims, and sought an order from the Tribunal directing Perenco to remedy any and all environmental damage in Blocks 7 and 21, and compensate for its failure to revert the Blocks to Ecuador in good working condition by paying damages to be determined in the quantum phase of this arbitration, inclusive of compound interest, and all costs and expenses of the arbitration.434\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 980-983.\n\n285.\n\nSince briefing of the quantum of both the alleged treaty and contract claims has not begun, the Tribunal will not address either of the quantum issues in this Decision.\n\n**E. Prayers for Relief**\n-------------------------\n\n286.\n\nPerenco requested that the Tribunal issue an award in the following terms:\n\na. Declaring that it has jurisdiction over Perenco\u2019s claims;\n\nb. Declaring that Respondent:\n\n(i) failed to accord fair and equitable treatment to Perenco\u2019s investments in breach of its obligations under Article 4 of the Treaty;\n\n(ii) impeded Perenco\u2019s use and enjoyment of its investments in breach of its obligations under Article 4 of the Treaty;\n\n(iii) unlawfully expropriated Perenco\u2019s assets in breach of its obligations under Article 6 of the Treaty, as well as under Ecuadorian Law;\n\nc.

JURISDICTION OVER CLAIMANT\u2019 S CONTRACT CLAIMS**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls its finding in its Decision on Jurisdiction that in general the claims for breach of the Block 7 and Block 21 Contracts by reason of the application of Law 42 fall within its jurisdiction.437\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 147, 161 and 242.\n\n289.\n\nEcuador, however, objected to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the Contracts to consider any claims relating to *caducidad* and, alternatively, to the admissibility of such claims.438 Perenco argued, both as part of its argument regarding a chain of events set into motion by Ecuador\u2019s refusal to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures as well as a separate argument, that the declaration of *caducidad* constituted a breach of contract.439\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 340, 343-367; see above at paragraphs 230,231, 233, and 237.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 212, 222-226; Reply, paragraphs 246-253.\n\n**A. The remaining objection of the Respondent**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nEcuador submitted that disputes relating to *caducidad* were not arbitrable under Ecuadorian Law.440 The Contracts provided, in clauses 20.2.12 and 20.2.1.3 of the Block 21 and Block 7 Contracts respectively, that the arbitration is \"governed by the provisions of this Contract...and *the laws of Ecuador\".441* Ecuador contended that Ecuadorian law permits only contractual disputes to be submitted to arbitration.442 The declaration of *caducidad,* however, was an \"expression of the State\u2019s power *(pouvoir public)* exercised through an administrative act that falls outside of the scope of issues that parties can dispose of *(materias transigibles)\"443* Administrative acts carry a presumption of legality under Ecuadorian law and may only be challenged before Ecuadorian courts (as per Article 173 of Ecuador\u2019s Constitution).444\n\nCounter-Memorial, section 5.1.1; Rejoinder, paragraphs 144-166; see above at paragraphs 230-232.\n\n[Emphasis added.]. Taken from clause 20.2.12 of the Block 21 Contract (see Exhibit CE-10, PER 04717). Clause 20.2.1.3 of the Block 7 Contract similarly provided \"the arbitration in law shall be guided by the provisions of this Participation Contract...and the laws of Ecuador.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 346-348 [Emphasis added.]; Rejoinder, paragraphs 154-155; 3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 182-183. Professor Aguilar referred to Article 4 of the Arbitration and Mediation Law in Ecuador, of which an English translation was provided at paragraph 11 of his 4th expert report: \"The persons or companies that are capable of settling *may submit to arbitration* governed by this Law, provided they fulfill the requirements established herein. For the different entities in the public sector to submit to arbitration, in addition to complying with the requirements of this Law, they shall fulfill the following additional requirements: a) Enter into an agreement to arbitrate, before the emergence of the dispute; in the event the agreement is sought to be signed after the dispute has arisen, the Attorney General of the State must be consulted, whose opinion will be binding; b) *The legal relationship to which the agreement relates shall be contractual in nature',* c) The arbitration agreement must include the manner in which the arbitrators will be selected; and, d) The arbitration agreement, through which the public sector institution waives ordinary jurisdiction, must be signed by the person authorized to contract on behalf of said institution. Failure to fulfill the above requirements implies the nullity of the arbitration agreement.\" [Emphasis added.]\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 346 [Italics in original.]; Rejoinder, paragraphs 157-158.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n291.\n\nIn this connection, Ecuador relied on the decision of an ICSID tribunal in *Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A.* v. *Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),445* which in its view found that issues relating to the validity of administrative acts, such as *caducidad,* were not arbitrable under Ecuadorian law.446\n\nExhibit CE-170, *Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10, Award (20 February 2004), paragraph 151 (Unofficial translation from Spanish original).\n\n*Ibid,* Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 350-351.\n\n292.\n\nEcuador\u2019s legal expert, Professor Aguilar, began his evidence in this regard with the premise that *caducidad* was \"an administrative sanction imposed through an administrative act.\"447 He referred to Article 65 of the Executive Branch\u2019s Legal and Administrative Regime Act in Ecuador448 and decisions of the Constitutional Tribunal449 and the Supreme Court of Justice450 to support the proposition that an administrative act may take the form of a unilateral declaration in the exercise of administrative function that produces direct and individual legal effects.451 He asserted that under Ecuadorian law such administrative acts enjoyed a \"presumption of legitimacy\", the burden falling on the party challenging the act to demonstrate that it was carried out in a manner that did not comply with applicable law or regulation.452 Professor Aguilar stated that under Ecuadorian law such a challenge could only be brought before its administrative courts.453 In his view the declaration of *caducidad* in this arbitration fit perfectly into this notion of an administrative act in Ecuador, and could not be challenged otherwise than in Ecuadorian administrative courts.454\n\n3 rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraph 160.\n\nProfessor Aguilar asserted that it provided that an administrative act could be \"a unilateral declaration made in the exercise of the administrative functions [sic] which produce [d] individual legal effects directly.\" 3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraph 161.\n\nCase File 013-AA-99-IS, supplement to Official Gazette 122, 4 February 1999 (3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, Annex No. 104).\n\nJudicial Gazette, Series XVII, No. 15, p 5212 (3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, Annex No. 103).\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 161-163.\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 166-167, 171. Professor Aguilar at paragraph 171 suggested that the administrative act must be complied with \"unless its illegitimacy is proven *judicially)\u2019* [Emphasis added.]\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraph 172. Professor Aguilar cited Article 217(1) of the Organic Code of Judicial Function in Ecuador which provides that \"[t]he judges of the Contentious Administrative chambers are charged with: 1. Hearing and resolving disputes that arise between the public administration and individuals for violation of legal norms or individual rights, whether in normative acts of lower in rank than the law, or in administrative acts or facts.\" (Organic Code of Judicial Function, 9 March 2009, Annex No. 101 to Aguilar, 3rd).\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 171-172, 179-181; 4th Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 15-18.\n\n293.\n\nProfessor Aguilar interpreted Article 74(4) of the Hydrocarbons Law, which identifies the legal and contractual breaches of sufficient gravity to justify the imposition of the sanction of *caducidad,* as providing a prerogative administrative power (as opposed to a contractual power) to sanction.455 This further supported his position that *caducidad* could not be the subject of arbitral review since it was not a dispute which was contractual in nature, as required by Article 4 of the Arbitration and Mediation Law (where a party to the dispute is a public sector entity).456\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 179-181; 4th Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 20-51.\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 182-183; 4th Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 11-14. In the English translation provided in the translated reports of both legal experts, the pertinent sentence in Article 4(b) reads: \"The *legal relationship* to which the agreement [Aguilar: \"relates shall\"] [P\u00e9rez Loose: \"refers must\"] be contractual in nature.\" [Emphasis added.] See 5th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 17; 4th Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraph 11.\n\n294.\n\nSecond, and in the alternative, Ecuador submitted that the parties to the Contracts expressly and contractually carved *caducidad* out of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal.457 Ecuador relied on clauses 21.3 and 21.4458 of the Block 7 Contract and clause 20.2 and Annex XVI of the Block 21 Contract.459 The former provided that if the Contract was terminated by reasons *other* than *caducidad,* the procedure to which the parties have agreed for disputes to be submitted to arbitration should be followed.460 Clause 20.2 of the Block 21 Contract in turn provided that \"if a caducity proceeding is initiated, in the event that the cause for caducity is related to technical or economic aspects\" the matter may be submitted to arbitration by either party.461 This had to be read together with Annex XVI which provides that once the ICSID Convention had been approved by the \"National Congress of the Republic of Ecuador and, therefore, [was] fully in force, the Parties agree[d] that any technical and/or economic dispute arising out of the application of the Participation Contract... shall be resolved according to the provisions of the aforementioned Convention, leaving, accordingly, without effect the Arbitration procedure provided in Clause twenty of the Contract.\"462\n\nCounter-Memorial, section 5.1.2; cf. Reply, paragraphs 125-150.\n\nEcuador in its Counter-Memorial at paragraph 354 refers to clauses 21.2.3 and 21.2.4 of the Block 7 Participation Contract, but this seems to be in error as these do not exist. The provisions excerpted are found instead at clauses 21.3 and 21.4 of the Contract, at Exhibit CE-17, PER 04858. This is confirmed by Ecuador in its Rejoinder, paragraph 169.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 354-355; Rejoinder, paragraphs 167-190.\n\nClauses 21.3 and 21.4 of the Block 7 Contract provides \"21.3 In cases of termination for reasons other than caducity, the procedures agreed to by the Parties in Clause Twenty shall be followed. 21.4 *For the effects of caducity and sanctions, the provisions of Chapter IX of the Hydrocarbons Law shall apply)\u2019* [Italics in original, emphasis added.] (Exhibit CE-17, PER 04858)\n\nClause 20.2 of the Block 21 Participation Contract provides that **\"Technical and/or Economic Arbitration:** In the event that the disputes are related to any matter not included within the scope of the previous clause or if, for any reason, submitting the matter to a consultant does not produce a final and binding resolution, the technical matters involving economic aspects, and vice-versa, shall be subject to a consulting and arbitration procedure accepted by Ecuadorian Law. Legal matters may not be submitted to arbitration and shall be submitted to the jurisdiction and competence set forth in the relevant legal provisions.  \n Additionally, if a caducity proceeding is initiated, in the event that the cause for caducity is related to technical or economic aspects, and the Parties have differing views, either of the Parties may submit the matter to arbitration. For as long as this process lasts, any caducity proceeding that might have been initiated shall be suspended.\" (Exhibit CE-10, PER 04713-04714).\n\nExhibit E-58, Annex XVI (Resubmitted on 11-17-09), p 4.\n\n295.\n\nIn this regard, in characterising the nature of claims in this arbitration that relate to *caducidad,* Ecuador submitted that because \"the motive for the declaration of *caducidad...* was legal and did not arise out of a disagreement of a technical or economic nature\" it fell strictly outside the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal as contractually delineated.463\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 358-360.\n\n296.\n\nLastly, Ecuador submitted that the claims relating to *caducidad* were premature because Perenco had not sought redress from the Ecuadorian administrative courts.464 It contended that treaty claims are \"defective\" unless there has been a \"reasonable attempt by the investor\" to pursue available judicial redress within the State, a ground distinct, in Ecuador\u2019s submission from the requirement to exhaust local remedies.465 Ecuador submitted that this claim was not viable until and unless Perenco challenged the lawfulness of the action in Ecuador\u2019s administrative courts.466\n\nCounter-Memorial, section 5.1.3.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 362-363, 366.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 364.\n\n**B. The Claimant\u2019s submission**\n--------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nPerenco submitted that if the Tribunal were to uphold the Respondent\u2019s objection it would be permitting Ecuador to employ its domestic laws to evade its Treaty obligation to submit all legal disputes with regard to investments to ICSID arbitration.467 Perenco relied on the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Occidental II,* where the tribunal considered a similar argument and held that Ecuador could not invoke its domestic law to avoid ICSID jurisdiction under the applicable treaty.468\n\nReply, paragraphs 108-113, referring to *Occidental II (Jurisdiction).*\n\nReply, paragraphs 110-112; *Occidental II (Jurisdiction),* paragraphs 38 and 82.\n\n298.\n\nPerenco submitted that in any event Ecuadorian law did not preclude arbitration of *caducidad-* related disputes. It referred to Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s evidence that Article 4(b) of the Arbitration and Mediation Law required only that the underlying legal relationship of the dispute be contractual and not that the dispute and the impugned conduct both had to be contractual in nature.469 Perenco argued that it \"cannot be disputed that the legal relationship arising out of the Participation Contracts is \u2018contractual in nature\u2019.\"470 Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose also took the view that Article 173 of Ecuador\u2019s Constitution provides only that administrative acts *may* be challenged before the Ecuadorian courts, and not that they *must* be challenged before the courts.471\n\nReply, paragraphs 114-115.\n\nReply, paragraph 115; 5th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 17.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, p 1533. Ecuador at paragraph 160 of its Rejoinder argued in tutn that the terms of Article 173 of the Constitution indicated it did not intend a choice of forum because it allegedly uses the term \"can\" rather than \"may\".\n\n299.\n\nPerenco submitted that Ecuador had misconstrued *Repsol,* asserting that it stands only for the proposition that an ICSID tribunal could have jurisdiction over an administrative act with possibly *res judicata* effect as long as the conditions of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention have been satisfied; the administrative nature of the State\u2019s conduct did not in and of itself preclude the tribunal from claiming jurisdiction.472\n\nReply, paragraphs 117-119.\n\n300.\n\nPerenco\u2019s expert also addressed the alternative scenario, namely, that if Article 4(b) of the Arbitration and Mediation Law required the disputed action to be of a contractual nature (and not just that the legal relationship from which the dispute arises is contractual), then the declaration of *caducidad* remained arbitrable because it was a \"contractual administrative act\".473 Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose defined such acts as \"administrative acts [that] presuppose the existence of a contractual relationship\" and marked by the characteristics that \"they are unilateral decisions through which the public entit[y] create[s], terminate[s] or modifies] private individual legal situations\" and \"whose raison d\u2019\u00eatre is an underlying contract or bilateral relationship established with a private citizen.\"474\n\n5th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 19.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 20-22.\n\n301.\n\nExamples given of \"contractual administrative acts\" were the imposition of a fine on a contractor for delay or breach of contract and orders to enforce guarantees and collect on insurance policies.475 Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose relied on the writings of civil legal theorists such as Juan Carlos Cassagne,476 Rodolfo Barra,477 Diana Ximena Correa478 and Luis Berrocal,479 who accepted the existence of a contractual administrative act and in one instance, referred to it as \"acts through which the contracting entity imposes a fine upon the contractor or unilaterally interprets the contract, *declares its caducity* etc.\"480 He submitted that the practice of arbitral tribunals in Ecuador confirmed that caducity was arbitrable; the examples cited included in one instance *Petroproduccion* as a disputing party, although the cases that considered actions terminating the contract referred to actions for \u2018unilateral termination\u2019, rather than a declaration of *caducidad.481*\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 21.\n\nCA-404, CASSAGNE, Juan Carlos: *El Contrato Administrativo* [The Administrative Contract], Second edition, Editorial Lexis Nexis Abeledo-Perrot, Buenos Aires, 2005, p 303.\n\nCA-400, BARRA, Rodolfo: *Los actos administrativos contractuales* [Contractual administrative acts], Editorial \u00c1baco de Rodolfo Palma, 1989, p 97.\n\nCA-407, CORREA, Diana Ximena: *El arbitraje en el Derecho Administrativo: una forma alternativa para el nuevo modelo de Estado* [Arbitration in Administrative Law: an alternative way for the new State model], Universidad de Extemado de Colombia, Bogot\u00e1, 2002, p 169.\n\nThe Colombian legal scholar Luis Berrocal defines contractual administrative acts similarly as \"those that are carried out within the term of force of the contract and for the purpose of the performance thereof. These occur within the so-called contractual stage. Therefore, their existence is determined by the existence of the contract, they depend directly on it. This is the case for acts through which the contracting entity imposes a fine upon the contractor or unilaterally interprets the contract, declares its caducity, etc.\" CA-402, BERROCAL, Luis; *Manual del Acto Administrativo* [Administrative Acts Manual] *Tercera Edici\u00f3n, Ediciones Profesionals C.

Some can be infractions or fines, others can be unilateral termination of contracts, yet again *caducidad:\"484*\n\n4th Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Aguilar, paragraphs 41 and 46. At paragraph 46, Professor Aguilar asserted that \"[s]ince there is no case law in Ecuador on the issue of the arbitrability of *caducidad,* Mr. P\u00e9rez Loose cannot affirm that the fact that *caducidad* is arbitrable is \u2018undisputedly\u2019 accepted.\" During cross-examination, Professor Aguilar admitted that \"[i]n Ecuador, there [was] a debate currently in connection with contractual administrative acts\", but clarified that \"there is no doubt that a non-contractual administrative act, the only way it can be challenged is...the Administrative Courtsf]\" (Transcript, Hearing the Merits, Day 6, p 1563).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, p 1536.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n303.\n\nWhen pressed further about the cases that he cited which dealt with unilateral termination, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose stated that *caducidad* and unilateral termination are one and the same thing.485 When asked whether he accepted that \"there can be a termination of a contract in the exercise as a Contracting Party and there can be the termination of a contract by resort to what [could be called] \u2018extra-contractual means\u2019 in the sense of initiating a process, an administrative process, such as *caducidad)* Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose responded that he agreed these were \"two avenues\", the latter of which was \"based in the law...but materialize[d] in the Contract\" and it was for this reason that \"in administrative law, this type of acts [sic]... are known as administrative contractual acts.\"486\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, p 1537. See also, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s response to a question from the Tribunal at p 1544.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, p 1544.\n\n304.\n\nAddressing the further issue of a contractual carve-out of caducity from arbitration, Perenco submitted that clauses 21.3 and 21.4 of the Block 7 Contract and clause 20.2 and Annex XVI of the Block 21 Contract did not exclude caducidad-related claims from the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.487 Instead, it argued that the clauses were purely procedural, setting out the procedure that should be followed by a party in terminating the contract based on different grounds, and not necessarily excluding the submission of *caducidad-related* claims to arbitration, nor requiring the submission of such claims exclusively to Ecuadorian courts.488 In this regard, it submitted that it is significant that the clauses appear in section 21 of the Block 7 Contract, which addressed \"Termination and Caducity of this Contract\", rather than the relevant sections on arbitration and applicable law (Sections 20 and 22, particularly clauses 20.3 and 20.4 which dealt with the submission to ICSID arbitration).489\n\nReply, paragraphs 127-150.\n\nReply, paragraphs 129-136.\n\nReply, paragraph 130.\n\n305.\n\nPerenco relied on the *Occidental* II Decision on Jurisdiction where Ecuador advanced a similar argument with regard to similar provisions, and the tribunal held that the clauses did not consist of a carve-out of *caducidad* disputes from ICSID jurisdiction because there was no evidence of a \"common intention\" to do so.490 Perenco contended that if parties intended a carve-out it would have been included in the arbitration provision of the contracts.491\n\nReply, paragraphs 138-139; see *Occidental II (Jurisdiction),* paragraphs 77 to 79.\n\nReply, paragraphs 141-142; cf. Rejoinder, paragraph 174.\n\n306.\n\nResponding to Ecuador\u2019s insistence on a distinction between legal and technical/economic issues, Perenco submitted that the question was not whether a *caducidad-related* claim was \"legal\" but whether it was \"related to technical or economic aspects.\"492 It characterised the declaration of *caducidad* in this regard as an inseparable element of Ecuador\u2019s coercive conduct against Perenco, which in the \"words of this Tribunal [gave] rise to a \u2018dispute concerning the participation percentages in the share of the produced crude oil [which] qualifies as an economic dispute relating to the Participation Contract\u2019\"493 and was part of a series of events which had an impact on key provisions relating to the sharing of economic benefits under the Contracts.494\n\nReply, paragraph 147.\n\nReply, paragraphs 148-149, quoting from the Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 146.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n307.\n\nPerenco submitted that \"only an explicit, clear and unambiguous waiver by the investor of its right to submit treaty claims to an ICSID Tribunal [could] bar such claims in ICSID arbitration\"495, and that none of the provisions in the Contracts could be said to constitute a clear and unambiguous waiver of ICSID jurisdiction over caducidad-related Treaty claims.496\n\nReply, paragraphs 151-162.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n308.\n\nLastly, Perenco submitted that it could not proceed before administrative courts in Ecuador because of the Tribunal\u2019s direction in its Decision on Provisional Measures that the parties should refrain from resorting to \"domestic courts of Ecuador to enforce or resist any claim...\".497 In any event, referring to the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Occidental II,* and the *Helnan International Hotels v. Arab Republic of Egypt* Annulment Decision, Perenco submitted that an argument to the effect that there can be no international wrong in an ICSID arbitration without a prior attempt to seek redress under municipal law is without merit.498\n\nReply, paragraph 164, quoting from paragraph 61 of the Decision on Provisional Measures.\n\nReply, paragraphs 165-168; Exhibits CA-351, *Occidental II (Jurisdiction),* paragraph 59, and CA-345, *Helnan International Hotels v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Decision of the *ad hoc* Annulment Committee (14 June 2010), paragraphs 47-49.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nThe caducity issue arises in connection with both the contract claims and Treaty claims. The latter are addressed below at paragraphs 628 to 630. Insofar as the contract claims are concerned, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction hinges on the construction of the relevant provisions of the two contracts.\n\n310.\n\nTurning to the Block 7 Contract, the Tribunal notes firstly that the power to declare *caducidad* is an administrative power residing in the Ministry of Energy and Mines, not in Perenco\u2019s counterparty, Petroecuador.\n\n311.\n\nSecond, *caducidad* is one of nine specified ways in which the Contract can terminate. Termination and *caducidad* are plainly not coterminous concepts.\n\n312.\n\nThird, the sub-clauses dealing with *caducidad* (clause 21.2 and 21.3) specify the procedure which the Ministry must follow, provide for cure periods for the contractor, and expressly distinguish between other forms of termination and termination by *caducidad.* \"In cases of termination *for reasons other than* caducity, the procedures agreed to by the Parties in Clause Twenty [\"Consulting and Arbitration\"] shall be followed.\"499 That is, by the Contract\u2019s express terms, all other forms of termination can be arbitrated and *caducidad* cannot.\n\nClause 21.3 of the Block 7 Participation Contract: Exhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04858 [Emphasis added.].\n\n313.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Block 7 Contract is thus clear that *caducidad* is subject to a separate regime. Declarations of caducity were excluded from the Contract\u2019s arbitration provisions, and the Tribunal thus lacks jurisdiction to review the declaration of *caducidad* for the Block 7 Contract.\n\n314.\n\nThe situation is different under the terms of the Block 21 Contract, which does not provide that \"[i]n cases of termination for reasons other than caducity, the procedures agreed to by the Parties in [the Arbitration section]\" shall apply. Instead, it states that if a *caducity* proceeding has been initiated, and the cause is related to technical or economic aspects, and the parties \"have differing views\", either party may submit the matter to arbitration.500 In such event, the process of caducity should be suspended for the duration of the arbitration.501 As the Tribunal discussed in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the parties also added provisions regarding the procedure of the arbitration through Annex XVI to the Block 21 Contract.502 Annex XVI provides that:\n\nOnce the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID, has been approved by the National Congress of the Republic of Ecuador and, therefore, is fully in force, *the Parties agree that any technical and/or economic dispute arising out of the application of the Participation Contract* for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon Region, which is the object of the present Contract, shall be resolved according to the provisions of the aforementioned Convention, *leaving, accordingly, without effect the Arbitration procedure provided in clause twenty of the Contract.*\n\nFor the application of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID, the following procedural rules shall also apply:\n\n1. The Parties agree to submit to the INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES *any technical and/or economic dispute relating to this Participation Contract* for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons for resolution through the Arbitration mechanism, which for all effects is hereafter referred to as \"THE CENTRE\"...503\n\nSee Clause 20.2 of the Block 21 Participation Contract: Exhibit CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04713-04714.\n\nSee Clause 20.2 (last sentence of first paragraph) of the Block 21 Participation Contract: Exhibit CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04714.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 125-147.\n\nExhibit E-58, Annex XVI (Resubmitted on 11-17-09), p 4 [Emphasis added.].\n\n315.\n\nThe Tribunal found that Annex XVI had to be considered when determining the scope of its *ratione materiae* competence over contractual claims.504 It found that the contractual claims advanced by Perenco that concerned a \"technical\" or \"economic\" dispute relating to the Block 21 Participation Contract fell within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, and that this was not a cumulative test (i.e. the dispute need not be of a technical *and* an economic nature).505 Clause 20.2 of the Block 21 Contract contemplates that a dispute regarding a declaration of caducity which is related to technical or economic aspects may be submitted to arbitration. Annex XVI does not single out caducity, placing upon the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal the sole limitation that the claim should concern a \"technical\" or \"economic\" dispute.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 130.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 127-135.\n\n316.\n\nHaving regard to the Tribunal\u2019s findings in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers that the declaration of *caducidad* has economic consequences and therefore falls within its subject-matter jurisdiction. The Tribunal accordingly finds that it has jurisdiction to entertain Perenco\u2019s claim that Ecuador breached the Block 21 Contract when it declared *caducidad.*\n\n**VI. CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT**\n-------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by identifying the law applicable to the claims of breach of contract, before turning to consider the Parties\u2019 submissions and its findings on liability.\n\n**A. Law applicable to the claims relating to the Participation Contracts**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nUnder Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, parties have full autonomy to designate the rules of law governing any dispute arising between them. In the present case, the parties to the Participation Contracts agreed for Block 7 that:\n\n**22.1 Applicable legislation:** This Contract is governed exclusively by Ecuadorian legislation, and the laws in force at the time of its execution are understood to be incorporated in it.506\n\nExhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04858.\n\n319.\n\nThe applicable law provision in the Block 21 Contract is identical (clause 22.1).507\n\n**\"Applicable law.** This Contract is governed exclusively by Ecuadorian legislation, and the laws in force at the time of its execution are understood to be incorporated in it.\" (Exhibit CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04722).\n\n320.\n\nAs a result of these express choices of applicable law, the Tribunal must apply Ecuadorian law.\n\n321.\n\nUnder the Block 21 Contract, \"any technical and/or economic dispute arising out of *(\u2018derivada\")* from the application of the Participation Contract\" shall be resolved by ICSID arbitration.508 The Tribunal has already found that the claim that the Block 21 contract was breached by the enactment of Law 42 and related measures falls within its jurisdiction.509 It has also found that there are limits on its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* in respect of the contract claims. The Tribunal held that the \"alleged violation of the Ecuadorian Constitution, its provisions on confiscation, discrimination and retroactivity of laws concern[ed] essentially legal matters, and cannot qualify as a \u2018technical and/or economic dispute relating to [the Block 21] Participation contract.\"510 Accordingly, these matters were not covered by the Parties\u2019 consent to arbitration, and therefore lie outside the Tribunal\u2019s competence.511\n\nExhibit E-58, Annex XVI (Resubmitted on 11-17-09), p 4.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 147.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 137.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n322.\n\nWith respect to the Block 7 Participation Contract, there is no equivalent restriction on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae',* clause 20.3 records the parties\u2019 agreement to \"submit the disputes or differences arising out of or related to the performance of this Participation Contract to the jurisdiction and competence of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes...\".512 The Tribunal has rejected the Respondent\u2019s objections to the Tribunal\u2019s competence over this claim.513 In doing so, it took note of the Claimant\u2019s statement that it \"does not contest the Ecuadorian \u2018constitutionality or legality\u2019 of Law 42 and its implementing regulations.\"514\n\nExhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04851-04852. Clause 20.3 provides: \"...from the date on which the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\u2018the Convention\u2019), signed by Ecuador, as a State member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, on 15 January 1986 and published in Official Registry No. 386 of 3 March 1986, is approved by the Ecuadorian Congress, the Parties shall be obliged to submit the disputes or differences arising out of or related to the performance of this Participation Contract to the jurisdiction and competence of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to be settled and resolved in conformity with the provisions of said Convention. Under this system of arbitration, the following provisions shall apply:...\".\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 161.\n\n*lb id.*, paragraph 158.\n\n323.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal applies Ecuadorian law, recognising that it should refrain from analysing the constitutionality or legality *per se* of Law 42 and related measures.515 The focus instead is on an alleged breach of contract said to arise out of Law 42\u2019s impact on Perenco\u2019s expected economic benefits resulting from its performance of the Contracts.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 137.\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s approach to the claims of breach of the Participation Contracts**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting its approach to the *Burlington* decision (Decision on Liability of 14 December 2012 in *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5)) and the decision of the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court on the constitutionality of Law 42, before turning to the parties\u2019 submissions on Law 42 and its effect on the Contracts.\n\n325.\n\nBoth parties have directed the Tribunal to certain findings made by the *Burlington* tribunal with a view to either urging the Tribunal to follow or reject such findings. While mindful of the fact that that the *Burlington* tribunal has also considered the Participation Contracts, the Tribunal notes that that tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction differs from its own. The *Burlington* tribunal had jurisdiction over treaty disputes only, and therefore to the extent that it considered the Participation Contracts, it did so incidentally to its treaty jurisdiction and evidently did not consider the Contract within the general framework of Ecuadorian law. There is, for example, no discussion by the tribunal in the Decision on Liability or in the dissenting opinion as to whether the Contracts are to be characterised as private or administrative contracts, yet this was addressed by the Constitutional Court and was a topic to which the parties\u2019 legal experts devoted considerable attention in this proceeding.516\n\nSee, for example, 1st Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 9, 14-28, 36-48; 3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 4-29; 80-107; 4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 3-16, 42-57; 4th Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 61-77.\n\n326.\n\nAs this Tribunal must determine any \"doubts and disputes that may arise\" during the Participation Contracts\u2019 terms, specifically any \"technical and/or economic dispute\"517, it is required not only to interpret the Contracts, but also to consider the type of powers that the State may have had under Ecuadorian law in relation thereto and how such powers could be exercised. Every economic claim has to be analysed in a legal context but that in itself does not prevent it from being characterised as an economic dispute. Indeed, extensive evidence has been submitted by both parties on questions of Ecuadorian law bearing on the interpretation and application of salient terms of the Participation Contracts. Given its contractual jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to analyse the issues put before it by the disputing Parties in light of their submissions and all record evidence, without basing its decision on the *Burlington* tribunal\u2019s contractual analysis.\n\nExhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, clause 20.3 and E-58, Annex XVI (Resubmitted on 11-17-09); Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 135, 146 and 157-160.\n\n327.\n\nBoth Parties referred to the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision. Insofar as the merits of the Court\u2019s judgment were concerned, Perenco contended - with reference to Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s criticisms - that it was not a \"persuasive and carefully reasoned treatment of the points of law addressed.\"518 This raised questions as to precisely what Perenco sought the Tribunal to do regarding the Constitutional Court\u2019s judgment both in relation to the contract and Treaty claims.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 236.\n\n328.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent emphasised that Law 42 had been declared constitutional by the highest court in Ecuador.519 It pointed out that during the jurisdictional phase, Perenco had stated that it \"does not contest the Ecuadorian \u2018constitutionality or legality\u2019 of Law 42 and its implementing regulations\"520 and that as a result of this, the Tribunal had held that the issue raised by the Respondent \"if it were to be construed as an objection, has become moot.\"521 Ecuador renewed its objection when the issue evidently reappeared in the merits phase in relation to Perenco\u2019s Revised Memorial\u2019s allegation that \"Ecuador\u2019s unilateral modification of the economic provisions of the Participation Contracts through the enactment and application of Law 42 [...] violated key constitutional provisions that were incorporated by reference into the Participation Contracts\" and that the \"constitutional - and in turn contractual - provisions mimic principles of international law explored above.\"522\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 557(v).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 15 January 2010, paragraph 63; Counter-Memorial, paragraph 371.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 371.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 369-372, quoting from paragraph 227 of the Revised Memorial.\n\n329.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant restated its position that it did not challenge Ecuador\u2019s authority to promulgate Law 42 nor did it request the Tribunal to grant relief that would involve overturning Law 42 or amending it. Rather, it confirmed that it challenged Law 42\u2019s application to the Participation Contracts and Ecuador\u2019s enforcement of Law 42 against Perenco, which in its submission breached Ecuador\u2019s contractual and treaty obligations.523 Accordingly:\n\nPerenco\u2019s claim that Ecuador breached the Contracts through conduct that was contrary to international law or inconsistent with principles recognized in the Ecuadorian constitution...should be understood in light of this position. To the extent that the assertions in paragraphs 272 to 232 of Perenco\u2019s Revised Memorial are considered to be inconsistent with that position, such assertions should be deemed withdrawn.524\n\nReply, paragraphs 174-176.\n\nReply, paragraph 176, reference to prior pleadings omitted.\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of this clarification on Perenco\u2019s part.\n\n331.\n\nWhile mindful that the Constitutional Court did not consider Perenco\u2019s Participation Contracts, the Tribunal considers that the Court\u2019s findings provide some guidance as to the meaning and content of Ecuadorian law governing contracts dealing with the exploitation of hydrocarbon resources. Accordingly, the Tribunal seeks to apply Ecuadorian law consistently with the Court\u2019s findings, mindful of what the Court did and did not decide.525\n\nThe Tribunal is alive to the nature and subject of the claims confronted by the Constitutional Court. The Court was asked to consider whether Law 42 violated any of the following constitutional norms and the consequences thereto: legal security, equality, non-retroactivity, respect for the hierarchy of laws, protection of property rights and observance of procedural formalities in its enactment. See Exhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42.\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal is also cognisant of the fact that while the Participation Contracts vested a jurisdiction in the Tribunal to decide certain types of disputes, they also conferred jurisdiction over other types of disputes on the Ecuadorian courts.526 The Tribunal has already held that it does not have jurisdiction over constitutional matters, which are \"essentially legal matters.\"527 It is not open to the Tribunal to second-guess the Ecuadorian courts\u2019 determination and application of Ecuadorian law in relation to such legal matters.\n\nFor example, clause 22.1.2 of the Block 7 Participation Contract provides that for claims which arise due to the acts or resolutions of the Ministry of Energy and Mines the Contractor may initiate claims or appeals before the local courts (Exhibit CE-17, PER 04859).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 137.\n\n**C. The submissions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nPerenco submitted that Law 42\u2019s enactment and enforcement unilaterally amended key terms of the Participation Contracts in breach of its provisions permitting modification by way of agreement only.528 The Contracts were governed by the *pacta sunt servanda* principle, a principle recognised in Ecuadorian law and incorporated in the Contracts by way of reference to Article 1561 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code and Article 31.1 of the Hydrocarbons Law.529 The principle was incorporated expressly in the Contracts\u2019 clause 15.2 which provided that any amendment required the mutual agreement of the parties.530\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 37; Revised Memorial, paragraphs 201-211; Reply, paragraphs 434-485.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 201-202. Article 1561 of the Civil Code in Ecuador provides that \"[e]very contract lawfully executed is law between the parties and cannot be invalidated unless it be by mutual consent of the parties or for legal causes.\" (CA-43, Civil Code, p 13). Clause 22.1 of the Participation Contracts provided that Ecuadorian legislation applied to them (Exhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04858, and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04722). Article 31.1 of the Hydrocarbons Law provides that \"[a]t the State\u2019s discretion, contracts for the exploration and use of hydrocarbons may be modified by an agreement of the contracting parties, and upon approval by the Special Bidding Committee (CEL)...\" (Exhibit CE-37 (Resubmitted on 04-12-12), Hydrocarbons Law, Decree 2967 of the Supreme Government Council (in Spanish with additional translated excerpt), PER 01542.1).\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 204; citing Exhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04829, and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04703; Reply, paragraph 435.\n\n334.\n\nPerenco argued that by applying Law 42 and related measures to the Contracts, Ecuador breached this principle because it \"effectively modified the Participation Contracts\u2019 economic terms.\"531 The participation it was entitled to receive and freely dispose of as a result of the operation of clause 8.1 of the Contracts constituted its \"gross income\", and as a result, formed the \"fundamental economic term\" of the Contracts.532 This economic term ensured that both the Contractor and the State had the potential to benefit from increasing oil prices; \"the State both through its own Participation percentage and also through the additional tax revenues and other benefits that Perenco paid.\"533 Law 42, however, was intended to, and in effect did, allocate the benefits of increasing oil prices \"almost exclusively to the State, and took them away from Perenco.\"534 It created \"an *additional* right for Ecuador (and a corresponding additional obligation on Perenco) that the Contracts simply did not grant it.\"535 Perenco submitted that this amounted to a breach of the Contracts\u2019 economic terms.536 It was a unilateral modification of the Contracts where Ecuadorian law (as incorporated by reference into the Contracts) and the Contracts themselves required any amendment to be by agreement of the parties.537\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 208.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 209; Reply, paragraph 447.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 210.\n\n*Ibid.* ; Reply, paragraphs 437-441, 446 and Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 8, pp 1937 *et seq.* The purpose of Law 42 was to \"cause oil operators such as Perenco to renegotiate their contracts\", and on Ecuador\u2019s own case, \"correct a *contractual* \u2018disequilibrium.\u2019\" (Reply, para 438 [italics in original].).\n\nReply, paragraph 446 [italics in original.].\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 210-211 ; Reply, paragraphs 437-440.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 211 ; Reply, paragraphs 436-460\n\n335.\n\nPerenco\u2019s rebuttal to the contention that Law 42 was at best \"an additional charge of some kind outside the contractual framework\"538 was that it ignored the fact that the types of income accruing to the State from oil activities set out in each Contract was a closed list. Article 44 of the Hydrocarbons Law identified the potential forms of income the State could derive from oil exploitation activities, and this was then reflected with greater particularity in the case of the Participation Contracts.539 Perenco submitted that \"[i]n fact, every one of the potential sources of State income [was] addressed in the Contracts either to require some payment or exempt the Contractor from paying anything in respect of that item.\"540 The Contracts thus comprehensively set out the Contractor\u2019s payment obligations and Law 42, by \"creat[ing] for the State an additional source of potential income not previously contemplated in the Hydrocarbons Law or the Contracts\", contravened the parties\u2019 agreement.541\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 213.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 217-218.\n\n*Ibid.* cf. Rejoinder, section 4.1.1.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 219.\n\n336.\n\nPerenco acknowledged that while Article 44 of the Hydrocarbons Law could be amended, such amendment was not automatically reflected in the Contracts which, as a result of the *pacta sunt servanda* principle and the terms of the Contracts themselves, required any amendment to be strictly by agreement.542\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n337.\n\nPerenco further submitted that the Contracts obliged Ecuador to negotiate a correction factor in the event that any measures it took upset the economy of the Contracts.543 This was not done.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 220; Reply, paragraphs 461-495.\n\n338.\n\nPerenco also contended that the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* could not be displaced by any, as it put it, \u2018administrative law doctrine of \u2018extraordinary powers\u2019\", and if it could, \"any such doctrine would require payment of full compensation to the contractor if the changes affect the economic terms of the agreement, which has not been offered much less paid here.\"544\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 207.\n\n339.\n\nIt similarly rejected any justification by Ecuador on the basis of the *rebus sic stantibus -* or extreme hardship - principle.545 The circumstances that ostensibly required the enactment of Law 42 were not unforeseeable since \"price fluctuations were specifically discussed during the Block 7 negotiations\" during which the parties agreed \"not to include a price band mechanism that would have increased the State\u2019s participation percentage for revenues above a reference price.\"546 Ecuador benefitted greatly from Perenco\u2019s investment and the high price of oil. As a result, it cannot claim that continued performance of the Contracts under these circumstances would have been \"excessively\" or \"unreasonably more burdensome.\"547 Finally, if made out, the principle entitles the invoking party to seek a renegotiation of the contract terms or, if such renegotiation should fail, a decision from the competent court or tribunal to readjust the terms of the contract or rescind it.548 Ecuador similarly failed to meet this requirement; it did not seek a negotiation or, failing that, a judicial solution.549\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 233-234; Reply, paragraphs 458-459. Notably, the Claimant in its reliance on the evidence of its expert Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose on the *rebus sic stantibus* doctrine seems to conflate its exercise with that of the administration\u2019s *jus variandi* power: Reply, paragraph 458 (\"Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose has already explained that the *rebus sic stantibus* doctrine does not apply to the Participation Contracts for a number of reasons, and could not justify Law 42 even if it did. *See* HPL ER V paragraphs 34-44; HPL ER I paragraphs 29-35; *see also* HPL ER I paragraphs 38, 91 (explaining that the administration\u2019s *jus variandi* cannot apply to deprive the contractor of the economic benefit of the contract signed with the State, that it does not apply to aleatory contracts such as the Participation Contracts, and that Law 42 was not an exercise of *jus variandi))* [italics and internal citations in original.].\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 234 and 237.\n\n*Ibid.* ; Reply, paragraph 459.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 233.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 234.\n\n340.\n\nFinally, Perenco submitted that Ecuador\u2019s \"relentless efforts to apply Law 42 eventually led it to breach other aspects of the Contracts\", namely, Perenco\u2019s right to freely dispose of and market its share of crude through the State\u2019s seizure of Perenco\u2019s oil through the *coactivas550* and its right to operate the Blocks with the State\u2019s forcible seizure and subsequent declaration of *caducidad* in 2009.551 In this connection, it argued that Ecuador committed a further breach of contract in failing to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures.552\n\nExhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, clause 5.3.2 (PER 04776), 10.1 (PER 04817), 10.2 (PER 04818), and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, clause 5.3.3 (PER 04663), 10.1 (PER 04696), 10.2 (PER 04696-04697); Revised Memorial, paragraphs 209-210; Reply, paragraph 149.\n\nExhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, clause 4.2 (PER 04758), and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, clause 4.2 (PER 04653); Revised Memorial, paragraph 212; Reply, paragraph 433.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, paragraph 79; Revised Memorial, paragraphs 222-226; Reply, paragraphs 246-253.\n\n341.\n\nPerenco further submitted that by exempting the application of Law 42 to another contractor operating in Ecuador, Andes Petroleum, with respect to its Tarapoa Block Participation Contract with Ecuador,553 Ecuador breached its contractual undertaking under clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Participation Contract not to discriminate between \"Participation Contractors for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons\".554\n\nExhibit CE-12, Modification Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) between Petroecuador and City Investing Company Limited, for the Tarapoa Block, 25 July 1995 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts) (\"Tarapoa Block Participation Contract\").\n\nReply, paragraphs 496-501.

The Tribunal notes that Perenco in its Reply indicated it was not going to pursue its claim of discrimination under the Treaty: Reply, paragraph 5.\n\n**(2) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nEcuador submitted that on a true construction of the Participation Contracts and correct application of Ecuadorian law, Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations cannot be said to have breached the Participation Contracts.555\n\nCounter-Memorial, sections 6.1-6.3.\n\n343.\n\nThe only guarantee that the Participation Contracts offered to the Claimant was \"participation\" in the form of an entitlement to a physical share in the oil produced.556 Clause 4.2 (of both Contracts) stipulated that the Contractor would receive a \"percentage of the Measured Production as compensation\" and this percentage was in turn determined using the formula set out in clause 8.1.557 Ecuador further relied on clause 5.3.2 of the Contracts in submitting that the \"Contractor\u2019s right under the Participation Contract was no more and no less than to \u2018[r]eceive the Contractor\u2019s Share of the Production at the Inspection and Delivery Center and freely dispose of the Contractor\u2019s Share of Production.\u2019\"558\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 375-383, 394-399.\n\n*Ibid,* Exhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04758, and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER PER 04653.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 382, quoting from Exhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04776.\n\n344.\n\nEcuador argued that Perenco cannot, in the face of a true construction of these contractual terms, reasonably claim a guarantee to a certain allocation of profit.559 The purpose and express wording of clause 8.2 of the Contracts supported its interpretation of key terms of the Contracts. Clause 8.2 reflected the \"Parties\u2019 agreement to fix, *for income tax purposes,* the gross income deemed to have been generated by the Contractor...Clause 8.2 thus provided: *The* *Contractor \u2019s Share of Production, calculated as an annual average at actual sales prices, which will in no case be less than the Reference Price, plus other income from the Contractor\u2019s activities related to this Contract, will constitute the gross income of the Contractor under the terms of this Contract, from which all applicable deductions will be taken and on which income tax will be paid in accordance with the provisions of Clauses eleven point one (11.1) and eleven point two (11.2).\"560*\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 384, 395; Rejoinder, section 4.1.2. Ecuador admitted that the prospect of adjustment factors in the Contracts to the Parties\u2019 respective participation percentages suggested that \"Perenco had protection that its Share of Production would generate for it at least the ex ante long term average return on cost of capital.\" (Rejoinder, paragraph 369).\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 386 [Emphasis and italics in original.]; citing Exhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04807; Exhibit CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04689.\n\n345.\n\nIn Ecuador\u2019s submission, this suggested that the Contracts did not intend to realize a guaranteed quantum of gross income in favour of the Contractor since it had to create an artificial construct for income tax purposes and, moreover, the State remained at liberty to apply a rate of tax to the gross income as it saw fit.561\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 386-388; 394-395.\n\n346.\n\nAlternatively, Ecuador submitted that even if clause 8.2 did guarantee a certain gross income, Law 42 did not alter clause 8.2 since it did not modify the formula for calculating the Contractor\u2019s gross income, and in this way cannot be said to have operated to breach clause 8.2.562\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 395(iii). The Claimant in its Reply noted that this submission taken to its logical limits suggested that \"there was nothing to stop Ecuador from taking away *all* of Perenco\u2019s economic benefit under the Contracts. On Ecuador\u2019s argument, it could have taken 100% of all revenue from oil production (without even a reference price threshold), and yet not have breached the Contracts in the slightest.\" (Reply, paragraph 450 [Emphasis in original.]).\n\n347.\n\nEcuador similarly rejected Perenco\u2019s claim in relation to the triggering of the renegotiation clause in the Participation Contracts.563 It submitted that it was not triggered because Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations did not upset the economy of the Participation Contracts.564\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 389-392, 409-421; cf. Reply, paragraphs 486-495.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 405, 409-421; Rejoinder, paragraphs 356-360.\n\n348.\n\nClauses 8.6 and 11.12 of the Block 7 Contract and 11.7 of Block 21 Contract \"caught only those modifications which *have an impact on the economics of\"\u2019* the Contracts and a correction factor could only be applied to \"absorb *that* \u2018impact\u2019 rather than to absorb any general increase in the tax burden on the Contractor.\"565 Ecuador\u2019s position was that clause 11.12/11.7 did not \"operate as a stabilisation measure which absorbed *any* increased tax burden on the Contractor.\"566\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 390 [Emphasis in original.]. The Claimant responded to this in its Reply, contending that it was a selective reading of clause 11.12/11.7: \"Ecuador\u2019s argument that the correction factor must \u2018absorb *that* \u2018impact\u2019 [on the economics of the Contracts] rather than to absorb any general increase in the tax burden on the Contractor\u2019 (ECM, paragraph 390, emphasis in original) inverts the plain language of the Contracts: Clause 11.12 provides, to the contrary, that the correction factor must \u2018absorb the impact *of the increase or decrease in the tax... burden\"\u2019* (Reply, paragraph 465 [Emphasis in original.]).\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 390 [Emphasis and italics in original.].\n\n349.\n\nEcuador contended in this regard that Perenco had failed to discharge its burden of demonstrating that Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations had an impact on the economy of the Participation Contracts, and what the appropriate adjustment would have been.567 In fact, Perenco \"offered no evidence as to the meaning of \u2018economics of this Contract\u2019 as a matter of Ecuadorian law\", much less adduced expert or other evidence to show Law 42\u2019s impact on the Participation Contract\u2019s economics (as understood when the Participation Contracts were signed).568\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 403, 405, 409-424 cf. Reply, paragraphs 466-495; see also, Rejoinder, paragraphs 366-367, section 4.2.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 405.\n\n350.\n\nIn Ecuador\u2019s view, the \"relevant enquiry [was] whether that measure impacted the long-term average oil price expectations upon which the Contractor\u2019s Share of Production in Clause 8 of the Participation Contracts was set such that, all things being equal, those X factors would continue to generate an IRR of around 15%.\"569 It pointed to evidence that suggested that the Law 42 reference prices were at all times set above the US$ 15/bbl mark, which it argued was the basis of the economic modeling undertaken in the negotiation of both contracts, and which could be found in the calculation attached to the Block 7 Participation Contract as Annex V.570 The reference prices for Blocks 7 and 21 at the time of execution of the Contracts were fixed by the Ministry of Energy and Mines at, respectively, US$ 25.111383/bbl and US$ 15.358274/bbl.571 Moreover, there were instances, such as in 2006, as reflected in the Oso Development Plan, that \"Perenco\u2019s own economic projections...were premised on a price/bbl *below* the Law 42 reference price.\"572 This and the 15-20% IRR identified in the 7th Bidding Round, which was representative of the *ex ante* long term economic assumptions underpinning the Participation Contracts, were preserved in the application of Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations.573\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 383.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 414-419; Rejoinder, section 4.2.1. The Claimant responded that this ignored that there existed a specific mathematical economic equation expressly set out in clause 8.1 of the Contracts, and this did not identify US$ 15/bbl as its premise. Clause 8.1 was a self-contained representation of the \u2018economy\u2019 or \u2018equilibrium\u2019 of the Contracts and this was confirmed by the fact that if a correction factor was to be applied to the Contracts as a result of a change in tax which impacted the economy of the Contracts, it would be applied to clause 8.1. See Reply, paragraphs 469-471. The Claimant submitted that Annex V did not purport to be a statement of the \u2018economy\u2019 of the Contract, its purpose only extended as far as demonstrating that it was in the interest of the State to convert to participation contracts: Reply, paragraph 473. The Claimant similarly argued vigorously against the imputation of Annex V, which was drawn up in connection with the Block 7 Contract, into the operation of the Block 21 Contract: \"It cannot be the case that the \u2018economy\u2019 of the Block 21 Contract is contained in a non-existent annex. Still less can it be true that an annex to a different contract, with a different purpose and in different circumstances, drawn up four years *after* the Block 21 Contract was concluded, establishes the \u2018economy\u2019 of the Block 21 Contract \u2018at the time of contracting,\u2019 as Ecuador claims.\" [Emphasis in original.] (Reply, paragraph 475). In its Rejoinder, Ecuador responded by asserting that clause 8.1 was clearly \"the product\" of the parameters considered and debated in the 7th Bidding Round, and for this reason the price assumption was constitutive of the mathematical-economic equation of the Contracts: Rejoinder, paragraph 381.\n\nExhibit E-126, Letter from the STET Director (Ministry of Energy and Mines) to Perenco dated 6 July 2006 with enclosures.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 420 [Emphasis in original.].\n\nRejoinder, section 4.2.1, in particular paragraphs 397-400. In its Rejoinder, Ecuador submitted there was a fundamental flaw in the economic analysis undertaken by Perenco\u2019s expert; it ignored that Perenco had been enjoying a price upside from the beginning of the Block 7 and 21 phases till Law 42 entered into force, and assumed that Law 42 and Decree 662 operated retroactively: Rejoinder, paragraphs 401-404.\n\n351.\n\nIn any event, assuming *arguendo* that Law 42 did affect the economy of the Contracts, Ecuador submitted that the renegotiation provisions at best imposed on the parties an obligation to negotiate and Perenco bore the burden of proving that the failure to agree to a correction factor was Ecuador\u2019s fault.574 Perenco is \"put to proof on the issue of causation\".575 Ecuador claims it cannot because it failed to \"take the most basic steps required even to invoke\" the clauses and then failed to secure its Consortium-partner\u2019s consent to the agreement that resulted from the negotiations conducted in 2009.576\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 422-423. The Claimant for its part had a different interpretation regarding on whom the burden of the renegotiation provisions rested; \"The adjustment clauses create a clear obligation of result on Ecuador: to modify the Contracts to include a correction factor to absorb the consequences of Law 42 on Perenco. This obligation has nothing to do with a mere obligation to negotiate for an uncertain result.\" (Reply, paragraph 489). See also, Rejoinder, section 4.3.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 423.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 424. The Claimant responded to this in its Reply; it submitted that the 2009 negotiations were not \"aimed at agreeing a \u2018correction factor\u2019 to the Clause 8 participation formulae but rather at terminating the Participation Contracts altogether and moving to a services contract\" and that it did not fail to provide the figures but was not required to do so until the process was initiated by Ecuador which the latter failed to do (Reply, paragraph 487). See also, Reply, paragraphs 490-494. The bottom-line for the Claimant was that the failure to reach an amicable solution was due to Ecuador\u2019s conduct; its conduct in negotiations was \"inconsistent and increasingly adamant\" and \"Ecuador among other things terminated negotiations, rebuffed comments from Perenco, and publicly announced that it would take over Perenco\u2019s operations and seize its oil.\" (Reply, paragraph 494).\n\n352.\n\nEcuador similarly denied any suggestion by Perenco that clause 22.1 of the Contracts operated as a stabilisation clause.577 Rather, that clause must be read as providing that the Contracts \"are governed by Ecuadorian legislation *\u2018and* such laws as were then in force\" at the time the Participation Contracts were concluded \"were incorporated by reference\".578 If this clause was a stabilisation clause, it would render nugatory the renegotiation mechanism of clauses 8.6 and 11.12 of the Block 7 Contract and 11.7 of the Block 21 Contract, which were triggered with an amendment to Ecuadorian law that had an impact on the economy of the Contracts.579\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 397. Ecuador took the same position with respect to clauses 8.6 and 11.7/11.12 (Rejoinder, paragraph 365).\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 397-398 [Emphasis and italics in original.].\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n353.\n\nMoreover, the clauses cannot be stabilisation clauses because under Ecuadorian law a stabilisation clause requires the State \"to have expressly excluded the application of laws/and or regulations enacted after the date of the execution of the contracts\", and the clause mirrors a provision in Article 7(18) of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, which means that to find that they are stabilisation clauses would suggest that all contracts governed by Ecuadorian law are governed by its law as frozen at the time of entry into the contract.580\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 398-400.\n\n354.\n\nFinally, Ecuador denied having committed any breach of contract in connection with the Decision on Provisional Measures. It contended that while the parties undertook in the Contracts to submit specified disputes to ICSID arbitration and to abide by a tribunal\u2019s *\"final* award\", they did not undertake to, and these obligations could not inferentially amount to an undertaking to, comply with a tribunal\u2019s recommendation of provisional measures.581\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 448 [Emphasis added.]; Rejoinder, paragraphs 422-425.\n\n355.\n\nOn the matter of Andes Petroleum and the contractual claim under clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Contract, Ecuador sought the claim\u2019s dismissal in the first instance because it was introduced late.582 It was raised for the first time by the Claimant in its Reply; it was not canvassed in its Request, Memorial or Revised Memorial.583 Ecuador submitted in the alternative that Perenco had failed to discharge its burden of proof in making out this claim, namely that it had failed to demonstrate that Perenco and Andes were in \"similar conditions\" (the term used in clause 5.1.28), that there was no credible justification for differing treatment and that there was an intention on the part of the state to favour Andes Petroleum in the Tarapoa Block Contract.584\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 426-427.\n\n*Ibid.* ; Reply, paragraphs 496-501.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 529-533; Rejoinder, paragraphs 426-428.\n\n**D. The Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n**(1) The salient terms of the Participation Contracts**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting certain basic features of the Contracts that bear on the contract dispute. Both Contracts were negotiated within the broader context of Ecuadorian law. Clause 22.1 (in both Contracts) stated that the Contract was governed exclusively by Ecuadorian legislation, and the laws in force at the time of its execution were understood to be incorporated in it.585 The \"Legal Framework\" then set out a non-exhaustive list of \"legal standards\" applicable to the Contract (including the Hydrocarbons Law, the Law amending the Hydrocarbons Law and various regulations pertaining thereto, as well as certain other general Ecuadorian laws).586\n\nExhibits CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract and CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract.\n\nClause 22.1.4 of the Block 7 Contracts identifies the following: The Hydrocarbons Law, published in the Official Registry No. 711 (November 1978), Law No. 101, published in the Official Registry No. 306 (13 August 1982), Law No. 08, published in the Official Registry No. 277 (23 September 1986), Decree Law No. 24, published in the Official Registry No. 446 (29 May 1986), Law No. 44, published in the Official Registry No. 326 (29 November 1993), Law No. 49 published in the Official Registry No. 346 (28 December 1993), Law amending Hydrocarbons Law, published in the Official Registry No. 523 (9 September 1994), Special Law of the State Oil Company of Ecuador (PETROECUADOR) and its affiliates, published in the Official Registry No. 283 (26 September 1989), Internal Tax Regime law, published in the Official Registry No. 341 (22 December 1989), Law No. 10 on the Fund for Amazonian Regional Eco-Development and the Strengthening of its Departmental Entities, published in the Official Registry No. 30 (21 September 1991) *etc.*\n\n357.\n\nBoth Participation Contracts contained an exorbitant clause recognising the Ministry of Energy and Mines\u2019 power to declare *caducidad* for the reasons and under the procedure established in Articles 74-76 of the Hydrocarbons Law.587 (The presence of such a clause was, as the Claimant\u2019s Ecuadorian law expert acknowledged, an indication of the existence of an administrative contract.588)\n\nClause 21 of the Block 7 and Block 21 Contract (basis on which, and the process by which, caducity proceedings may be initiated): Exhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04855, and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04720.\n\n1st Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 14, 17 and 37.\n\n358.\n\nInsofar as interpretative guidance was given by the parties, clause 3.1 of each Contract stated that the Contract was to be interpreted \"in accordance with the provisions of Title XIII, Volume IV of the Civil Code of Ecuador...\"589 Article 1561 of the Civil Code provides that: \"All contracts legally entered into are law for the parties, and can only be invalidated by mutual consent or on legal grounds.\"590\n\nExhibits CE-17, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04743, and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04643.\n\nCA-381, Civil Code, Official Registry No. 46 of 24 June 2005 (in Spanish); Counter-Memorial, paragraph 259.\n\n359.\n\nBoth the Hydrocarbons Law and the Participation Contracts required the mutual consent of the parties to amend the contracts. Article 31-A of Hydrocarbons Law established that oil contracts may be amended, if that is in the interests of the State, provided that, among other things, the contractor\u2019s consent is obtained.591 This statutory premise was subsequently reflected in the Contracts themselves.592\n\n\"At the State\u2019s discretion, contracts for the exploration and use of hydrocarbons may be modified by an agreement of the contracting parties, and upon approval by the Special Bidding Committee (CEL). To do so, favorable premodification reports will be required from the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Board of Directors of Petroecuador, and the Ministry of Energy and Mines.\" (Exhibit CE-37 (Resubmitted on 04-12-12), Hydrocarbons Law, Decree 2967 of the Supreme Government Council (in Spanish with additional translated excerpt), PER 01542.1).\n\nExhibits CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, clause 11.7 (PER 04699) and CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, clause 11.12 (PER 04823).\n\n360.\n\nBoth Contracts contained a volume sharing formula as well as other provisions aimed at preserving the parties\u2019 respective shares of production. Clause 8 of the Block 7 Contract, the \"Participation and Delivery Procedures\" clause, for example, contained an \"economic stability\" clause tied to potential modifications of the tax regime:\n\n**8.6 Economic stability:** If, due to acts of the Ecuadorian Government, or PETROECUADOR, any of the events described below should occur, that has consequences for the economy of this Contract, a correction factor shall be included in the participation percentages that absorbs the increase or decrease in the economic burden:\n\na) Modification of the tax regime, as described in clause 11.12...593\n\nExhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04811 -04812 [Bolding in original.].\n\n361.\n\nThe parties also addressed the relationship between taxation measures and their respective shares of production. Clause 11, paragraphs 1 to 11 in the Block 7 Contract (and clause 11, paragraphs 1 to 6 of the Block 21 Contract) contained a comprehensive list of fiscal measures and was clearly designed to operate such that if a new tax was implemented, or an existing tax was changed, the right to seek a modification of the Contract would be triggered. This is made clear by the final provision of clause 11.12 of the Block 7 Contract (clause 11.7 of the Block 21 Contract) which provides:\n\n**11.12 Modification to the tax regime.** *In the event o f a modification to the tax regime or the creation or elimination of new taxes not foreseen in this Contract...* on the signature date of this Contract and as described in this Clause, or their interpretation, *which have consequences for the economy of this Contract, a correction factor shall be included in the participation percentages, which absorbs the increase or decrease in the tax burden...* This correction factor shall be calculated between the Parties and following the procedure set forth in Article thirty-one (31) of the Regulations for Application of the Law Amending the Hydrocarbons Law.594\n\n[Bolding in original, emphasis added.] This refers to Decree No. 1417, Regulation for the Application of the Hydrocarbons Law, Official Registry No. 364 of 21 January 1994, found at Exhibit CE-6 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts). Article 31 provides: ***\"Competencia de otros \u00f3rganos:***  *No requieren de aprobaci\u00f3n del CEL las modificaciones contractuales derivadas de modificaciones del sistema tributario aplicable al contrato, asi como las que no afecten a la esencia del contrato, calificadas como tales por el CEL, previa consulta a este organismo por parte del Presidente Ejecutivo de PETROECUADOR, las mismas que ser\u00e1n aprobadas por el Consejo de Administraci\u00f3n del Petroecuador* y *se implementaran a troves de contratos modificaborios. Se exceptuaran aquellos casos en los que la Ley, en forma expresa, establece la competencia de otros \u00f3rganos\"* (PER 00498) (Rough translation: **Competition from other bodies:** No CEL require approval of contract modifications derived from tax changes applicable to the contract, so as to not affect the essence of the contract, classified as such by the CEL, after consultation with the agency by Executive President of Petroecuador, the same that will be approved by the Board of Directors of Petroecuador and modificaborios implemented through contracts. Those cases where the Act expressly provides for the competence of other organs are excepted.\") Article 32 follows on to provide in part (Claimant\u2019s translation): \"Article 32 Procedure [for amending the contracts]: \"The modifications which are subject to the Special Bidding Commission (CEL), shall comply the following procedure:\" (...) b) Provided that the parties have reached mutual agreement over the proposed modification, Petroecuador's Executive President shall submit the modifications agreed to with the contractor to the Administrative Counsel for consideration and report; (...) d) Should the corresponding Minister agree with the negotiated modifications, it shall issue a favorable report and request reports from the Attorney General's Office and from the Joint Chiefs of Staff respectively.\" (Exhibit CE-6, PER 00503).\n\n362.\n\nBy their own terms, clauses 11.7 and 11.12 of the two Contracts did not preclude the State from introducing new taxes or modifying existing ones, but in the event that such measures were introduced that had \"consequences for the economy of\u2019 the Contract, the obligation arose to negotiate a \"correction factor\" that would absorb the increase or decrease in the tax burden.\n\n363.\n\nClauses 15.2, entitled \"Contractual Amendments\", stated in this regard:\n\n**15.2 Contractual amendments:** The negotiation and signing of amending contracts shall take place, by agreement of the Parties, particularly in the following cases:\n\nc) When the tax or currency exchange regime or labor participation applicable to this type of Contract in the country has been amended, in order to reestablish the economy of this Contract, in conformity with clause 11.11.595\n\nExhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04829, and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04703. The reference to clause 11.11 appears to be in error; it should be a reference to clause 11.12.\n\n364.\n\nThe inclusion of the tax modification and contractual amendment clauses thus reflected the parties\u2019 agreement, noted above, to list the applicable taxes, encumbrances, employee profit sharing and contributions that would be required of the contractor.\n\n365.\n\nTwo points about the foregoing clauses warrant note. First, the predicate for the introduction of any correction factor was the demonstration (and subsequent agreement of the parties) that the new or modified tax had \"consequences for the economy\" of the contract; a new or modified tax that did not have such consequences would not require a correction factor. Second, clause 11 did not stipulate how the correction factor would be calculated, because the precise nature of a future or modified tax and its potential effect on the Contract could not be known at the time of contracting. Clause 11 did stipulate the ultimate result, namely, a change in the parties\u2019 respective participations \"which absorbs the increase or decrease in the tax burden.\" The process envisaged was one of the negotiation in good faith of a mutually agreeable offset that would result in an amended contract.\n\n366.\n\nWhile these clauses were clearly designed to protect the contractual bargain, in the Tribunal\u2019s view they do not constitute stabilisation clauses *per se.* By their own terms (e.g. in \"the event of a modification to the tax regime or the creation... of new taxes not foreseen in this Contract...\") the Contracts plainly did not purport to freeze Ecuadorian law as at the time of their signing and prohibit the State from modifying the tax regime.\n\n367.\n\nIn this connection the Respondent pointed out that Ecuadorian legal practice contains examples of stabilisation agreements and they expressly require the State to exclude the application of laws and regulations enacted after the date of the contract\u2019s signing. The Participation Contracts at issue in this case do not do that.596 Moreover, the Constitutional Court held that the \"renunciation of exercise [of the State\u2019s power to modify or reform administrative contracts] must be made expressly in the corresponding administrative contract\".597 As noted, there is no such waiver in either Contract.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 398; Rejoinder, paragraph 365.\n\nExhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42, p 25.\n\n368.\n\nThe final notable feature of the Contracts is that both contained a broadly worded agreement that the \"Parties undertake to use the means set forth in this Contract to resolve *doubts and disputes that may arise during its life...\"598* The inclusion of the word \"doubts\", combined with the jurisdiction to resolve \"economic\" disputes, indicates to the Tribunal that the parties wished to ensure that disputes such as the present one could be put before a tribunal such as the present one.\n\nClause 22.2.2 of both Contracts (Exhibits CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04724 and CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, 04865) [Emphasis added.].\n\n**(2) Did Law 42 amend, modify or change the legal framework applying to the Participation Contracts?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nAlthough Perenco contended that Law 42 amended the Contracts, its pleadings also embraced the possibility that this was not the case. In its Reply, Perenco maintained its primary position that Law 42 unilaterally amended key terms of the Contract, whether by *direct* amendment or by *indirect* amendment with the creation of additional contractual rights that took away from the benefit of performing key terms.599 It also argued, in the alternative, that Law 42 was an amendment \"in effect even if not in terms.\"600\n\nReply, part VI, section A.\n\nReply, paragraph 287.\n\n370.\n\nThis alternative characterisation of what was effected by Law 42 was - to the Tribunal\u2019s mind rightly - a recognition that Petroecuador, the company\u2019s contractual counterparty, did not unilaterally amend the Contracts and therefore did not breach the Contracts\u2019 provisions requiring mutual agreement to any amendment of their terms.\n\n371.\n\nThat however is not the end of the matter. The fact that Petroecuador, as the nominal counterparty to Perenco, did not itself purport to amend the Contracts does not mean that the State did not modify their operation by other means. Law 42 required the contractor to pay to the State a newly declared \"participation in windfalls from oil prices not negotiated or anticipated.\"601 In doing so, it effectively modified the operation of clauses 5.3.2 (the right to receive the Contractor\u2019s share of the production at the Fiscalization and Delivery Center and to \"freely dispose of\u2019 that share), 8.2.1 (the Contractor\u2019s right to opt to receive its share in cash), and 10.2 (the Contractor\u2019s right to market the production that belongs to it on the domestic or foreign market) of the Block 7 Participation Contract (and the corresponding clauses of the Block 21 Participation Contract).602\n\nArticle 44 of the Hydrocarbons Law was replaced by the following: \"At the very least the State will receive the following for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits: access premiums, surface rights, royalties, remediation payments, investments in remediation works, participation in surplus from oil sale prices, and for transportation, a share of rates.\" Article 55 was amended to add the following clause: \"State participation in surplus from oil sale prices not negotiated or anticipated. The contracting companies that maintain participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon contracts in force with the Ecuadorian State in accordance with this law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil from participation corresponding to it, whenever the actual average monthly FOB sale price of Ecuadorian crude oil exceeds the monthly average sale price in force on the date that the contract is signed, and expressed in amounts from the settlement month, will recognize participation by the Ecuadorian State of at least 50% of the surplus generated by the difference in price. For the purposes of this article, extraordinary profits are understood to mean the described difference in price multiplied by the number of barrels produced. The crude price on the contract date used as a reference for calculating the difference will be adjusted by the US Consumer Price Index published by the Central Bank of Ecuador.\" (Exhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42, pp 23-24).\n\nExhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal is fortified in its conclusion that this was a modification of the Participation Contracts\u2019 operation by the Constitutional Court\u2019s discussion of the *pacta sunt servanda* rule, where the Court described Law 42 as an exercise of \"the power to *modify or revise* the agreement... \".603\n\nExhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42, p 24 [Emphasis added.].\n\n373.\n\nTechnically, as Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose pointed out, this was an \"act of the prince\" *(factum principis),* i.e., an intervention by branches of government other than the contractual counterparty which changed the conditions pursuant to which Perenco performed the Contracts.604\n\n1st Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 43 and footnote 52. He noted further that the fact that this was done by the legislature as opposed to the contractual counterparty was immaterial as far as the conditions prescribed by Ecuadorian law for the exercise of the *jus variandi* power were concerned.\n\n374.\n\nIt follows from this finding that the Tribunal cannot accept Ecuador\u2019s argument that since Law 42 addressed revenues, not participation shares, it therefore addressed a matter which fell completely outside of the Contracts.605 Until Law 42, the contractor was free not only to take legal title to its share of the production, but also to sell it on the market or take cash in lieu of oil. Law 42 created a new claim by the State to additional revenue above a new reference price and a correlative obligation on the part of the contractor to pay that revenue to the State. This indeed was a \u2018conceptual modification\u2019 of the Contracts, to use Mr. Silva Romero\u2019s term.606\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 368-372, cf. Reply, paragraphs 445-448.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 8, p 2133.\n\n**(3) Did Law 42 fall within the scope of the taxation modification clauses?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nAs an amendment to the most directly relevant statute listed in the Contracts\u2019 legal framework, namely, the Hydrocarbons Law, the question arises as to whether Law 42 was a tax and therefore caught by the taxation modification clauses of the Contracts. Perenco argued the point both ways, arguing that Law 42 was not a tax as understood by Ecuadorian law, but in the alternative, if it was, it was caught by the Contracts\u2019 tax modification clauses, which required an adjustment of the parties\u2019 participations in its favour.607 For its part, Ecuador argued that the Law 42 dues should be treated as a \"tax\" or a \"levy.\"608\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 220; Reply, part VI, section B.\n\nCounter-Memorial, section 6.2.1; Rejoinder, sections 4.2.2 and 4.3.\n\n376.\n\nThe evidence goes both ways: (i) Ecuador\u2019s Attorney General argued before the Constitutional Court that Law 42 was not a tax, but rather an amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law (which it plainly was; that said, in exacting a fiscal charge from private contractors it did not follow the means prescribed by Ecuadorian law for the enactment of a taxation law);609 (ii) Law 42 created an obligation under Ecuadorian law to pay revenues to the State; (iii) after the law was ruled to be constitutional, Perenco\u2019s letters to Petroecuador described Law 42 dues as a \"tax\", and requested the initiation of the tax modification procedures pursuant to the Contracts;610 (iv) although the evidence is inconclusive, it does not appear that at that time, Petroecuador took the position that such clauses were inapplicable because Law 42 dues were not taxes; and (v) when it came to the two ICSID cases, Ecuador characterised Law 42 as a tax or \"levy.\"611\n\nExhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42, p 22: \"That the law in question is not a tax, both because it lacks the constitutional elements of a tax law, and because, given that it is an amendment of a principal law, it has the same fate, and the Hydrocarbon Law is in no way a tax law[\u2026]\"\n\nExhibits E-129, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December 2006 (Block 21) (in Spanish with English translation), section 4.2 and E-130, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December 2006 (Block 7) (in Spanish with English translation), section 4.1.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc v Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction (2 June 2010), paragraphs 132-134.\n\n377.\n\nOn balance, having regard to its economic effect, the fact that it mandated the payment of monies to the State in accordance with a specified formula, and Perenco\u2019s contemporaneous characterisation of Law 42 as a tax to which the taxation modification clauses of the Contracts applied, the Tribunal considers that Law 42 should be treated as a taxation measure.\n\n378.\n\nAccordingly, Law 42 modified the tax regime governing the Participation Contracts with the result that Perenco was entitled to require Petroecuador to engage in negotiations to determine Law 42\u2019s effect on the economy of the Contracts and to arrive at a consequent correction factor (in the event the parties agreed that the tax affected the economy of the Contract).\n\n**(4) The request for negotiations**\n------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nIn letters dated 18 December 2006, Perenco requested Petroecuador to \"order the commencement of the corresponding administrative process...for which the Consortium will present the numbers which illustrate said economic impact on the Contract.\"612 Such figures would demonstrate Law 42\u2019s impact \"in order to determine the percentage of participation which should be adjusted in favor of the Contractor.\"613 These letters were sent to the Palacios Administration days before it was about to leave office.\n\nExhibits E-129, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December 2006 (Block 21) (in Spanish with English translation), pp 7-8 and E-130, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December, 2006 (Block 7) (in Spanish with English translation), p 4.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n380.\n\nIt is common ground that there was no official response to this request. There is no contemporaneous document evidencing either the outgoing Palacios Administration\u2019s or indeed the incoming Correa Administration\u2019s rejection (or acceptance for that matter) of Perenco\u2019s request.\n\n381.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr. Laurent Combe was cross-examined on the reasons for the making of this request and the company\u2019s perception of the unofficial reaction occasioned by the letters:\n\n... Previously, during August 2006, we had successful negotiation with the tax authorities to adjust the \"X\" Factors for a change in the VAT.\n\nSo, we thought at the end of 2006 we might want to try the same avenue and see whether the Government would be more responsive to this kind of argument than just an argument of non-constitutionality. So, that\u2019s why we were going through this. We were feeling the door \u2014 feeling the water, sorry, try to get through that avenue, but at the time things were quite tense, so we didn\u2019t want to be too confrontational, which is we [sic] sent the letter, we never had any feedback, official feedback, we had informal feedback, so we felt that just sending the numbers like this without having a proper response from Petroecuador would have been too confrontational, which is why we never sent the data.614\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Merits, Day 2, p 522 (Testimony of Lament Combe).\n\n382.\n\nMr. Combe then adverted to the impending change of personnel as a result of the governmental transition and the company\u2019s decision to temporise in the fact of a change of administrations:\n\n\"What I was about to say is, there was a change in administration in 2007, so actually there were new people coming, so the people that received that letter were probably not the people that were in place later on, and there was a lot of confusion, a lot of things happening, and we had informal feedback that the letter wasn\u2019t well-received, so we thought that it would be prudent to wait a little bit to see whether things would settle down so we could arrange a talk.\"615\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Merits, Day 2, pp 523-524 (Testimony of Lament Combe).\n\n383.\n\nMr. Combe did confirm that the study to which the 18 December 2007 letters referred was in fact performed by Perenco,616 but testified that it was not submitted to Petroecuador to show the company\u2019s view of Law 42\u2019s impact upon the economy of the Contracts.617 The disputing Parties agree that after the letters of 18 December 2006, no further steps were taken by Perenco in relation to its request nor did the new administration propose clause 11 taxation modification negotiations in early 2007.618\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Merits, Day 2, pp 521-524; 530-531 (Testimony of Lament Combe).\n\nMr. Combe testified that for its part, Perenco expected \"an acknowledgment of that letter\" and \"nomination of the focal point so we could...[present] numbers\" before matters proceeded further: Transcript, Hearing on Merits, Day 2, pp 530-531 (Testimony of Laurent Combe).\n\nOn Perenco\u2019s part, see Mr. Combe\u2019s testimony: Transcript, Hearing on Merits, Day 2, p 524 (\"We never sent another letter in these terms.\").\n\n**(5) Did Perenco sufficiently test the taxation modification process when Law 42 was applied at 50% ?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nThe existence of a taxation modification process is of pivotal importance in considering Perenco\u2019s claim that Law 42 at 50% breached the two Contracts. Clause 11 of both Contracts provided the parties, in this case Perenco, with a means to subject new or modified taxes to a negotiating process that could lead to an adjustment of their respective entitlements. Given the fact that the process\u2019 initiation was requested but nothing happened thereafter, the Tribunal must decide who bears responsibility for this state of affairs and what legal consequences follow. Put simply, did Perenco do enough?\n\n385.\n\nHaving reflected on the precise terms of the Contracts and all of the relevant circumstances, the Tribunal considers that since Perenco contended that Law 42 had an impact on its Contracts\u2019 economy (a view not shared by President Palacios when he described Law 42\u2019s effect to the Congress), it was incumbent upon Perenco to fully pursue the clause 11 remedy. To succeed on this part of its breach of contract claim, Perenco must: (i) satisfy the Tribunal that it took sufficient steps to press for negotiations, or alternatively, that it was futile to press the new administration to engage in taxation modification negotiations; or (ii) had such negotiations occurred with all relevant documentation submitted and the disturbance of the Contracts\u2019 economy proven, the State then refused to engage in good faith adjustment of the Contracts.\n\n386.\n\nAt the hearing, when asked by a member of this Tribunal whether he considered it was futile to invoke clause 11, counsel stated that that was the Claimant\u2019s position.619 For its part, Ecuador\u2019s view was that Perenco having stated its intention to deliver the economic case in favour of the Contracts\u2019 readjustment, thereafter did not act on that intention because it recognised that their economy had *not* been disturbed by the establishment of a reference price above US$ 15/barrel and a continued entitlement to 50% of the so-called \"extraordinary revenues.\"620 Perenco\u2019s riposte was that it was not necessary to do so until the administrative process was formally launched, which it never was.621\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Merits, Day 8, pp 1974-1975, 2241 (Closing Arguments).\n\nCounter-Memorial, section 6.2.1, paragraph 481.\n\nReply, paragraph 487.\n\n387.\n\nIt is undisputed that Perenco did take the first step of requesting negotiations. It is also undisputed that it prepared the study to support its claim that the Contracts\u2019 economy had been disturbed, but it did not submit the study to Petroecuador. It is also apparent that although there was never any \"official feedback\" from the outgoing administration, there was informal feedback that the letter was not \"well-received.\"622 Finally, it is undisputed that the newly appointed officials of the incoming administration were not contacted by Perenco with a view to asking the administration to act on the request recently made of its predecessor. As Mr. Combe stated forthrightly, based on the unofficial reaction (of unidentified officials), Perenco \"...thought that it would be prudent to wait a little bit to see whether things would settle down so we could arrange a talk.\"623\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Merits, Day 2, pp 523-524 (Testimony of Lament Combe).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n388.\n\nAlthough it is a close call, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, insufficient contemporaneous evidence was adduced by the Claimant in support of the claimed futility of pressing for taxation modification negotiations.\n\n389.\n\nThe evidence against Perenco\u2019s claim of futility is first, the company\u2019s then recent experience in successfully using the modification clause, second, the absence of any official rejection of the request at a time of transition in government, and third, Perenco\u2019s contemporaneous evaluation of the situation in Ecuador.\n\n390.\n\nIn terms of its prior experience with the remedy, Perenco\u2019s Block 7 letter referred to the parties\u2019 then-recent experience with the \"[i]ncrease in the Amazon Region Ecodevelopment Tax\" with respect to the Block 21 Contract and expressed Perenco\u2019s view as to what would occur in relation to the Law 42 \"tax\" with respect to the Block 7 Contract.624 At the hearing, Mr. Combe noted that in August of 2006, four months prior to the 18 December letters, \"we had successful negotiation with the tax authorities to adjust the \u2018X\u2019 Factors for a change in the VAT.\"625 The remedy was thus acknowledged to have been effective in August 2006 (a time when Law 42 had already been enacted and applied and the constitutional challenge was underway).\n\nExhibits E-129, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December 2006 (Block 21) (in Spanish with English translation), section 4.1 and 4.2, and E-130, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December 2006 (Block 7) (in Spanish with English translation), section 4.1. In the letter concerning the Block 21 Contract, the increase in the tax (from US$ 0.10 to US$ 0.50 per barrel) was conceded by Ecuador to have an impact on the \"economics of the contract\", this calculation having been done and included in the first Amendment to the Development Plan for Block 21. The amended development plan expressly provided that the Contractor, before beginning production in Block 21 under the amended development plan, was required to \"present to Petroecuador for consideration a study to determine the correction factor that would absorb the increase of the tax burden caused by the increased tax.\" (Exhibit E-129, section 4.1)\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, p 522 (Testimony of Laurent Combe).\n\n391.\n\nAs for the absence of any official rejection of the requests, the Tribunal notes two points. First, the Tribunal considers it to be unrealistic to think that the outgoing administration could resolve a taxation modification negotiations request submitted in the final days of its time in office. Mr. Combe himself recognised that with a change in administrations came a change in government representatives (\"...there was a change in administration in 2007, so actually there were new people coming, so the people that received that letter were probably not the people that were in place later on, and there was a lot of confusion, a lot of things happening\").626 Second, although Perenco stated that it would forward the necessary economic data in support of its request for an adjustment of participation, it did not do so either while the Palacios administration was still in office or after it was succeeded by the Correa administration.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Merits, Day 2, pp 523-524 (Testimony of Lament Combe).\n\n392.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal considers that it is important not to permit subsequent events to colour an appraisal of the situation in early 2007. Perenco\u2019s request predated, by over ten months, Decree 662 and the steps taken by the Correa administration to force the conversion of participation contracts into service contracts. There is insufficient contemporaneous evidence before the Tribunal to lead it to conclude that in January 2007, the new Correa administration would have rebuffed a request for modification negotiations.\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal has no illusions that any such negotiations would have been challenging. Petroecuador could have been expected to have advanced the Government\u2019s view (expressed by the former President627) that Law 42 did not have any impact on the economy of the contracts and the parties would likely have debated the meaning of \u2018economy of the contract\u2019 as they have in this proceeding. Had Perenco submitted its study, Petroecuador would no doubt have scrutinised the company\u2019s financial performance, both prior to and after Law 42\u2019s enactment, and if Perenco had performed as well as the limited evidence before the present Tribunal suggests, it can be anticipated that Petroecuador would have pressed it on \u2018how much profit is enough?\u2019628 Much of the evidence that has been led by both Parties in the current arbitration as to whether or not Law 42 had an impact on the Contracts\u2019 economy, including the evidence of the pricing and profitability expectations of the original contracting parties at the time of the Contracts\u2019 making, general industry expectations of returns on investment, and so on, could be expected to have been discussed. But the challenges of negotiating a modification cannot be accepted as a basis for deciding not to press the contractual avenue and cannot support a finding of futility.\n\nAt the time that the President submitted Law 42 to the Congress, he asserted that \"...all the technical, economic, and legal parameters considered by the companies in their analysis are being respected, and what is being legislated upon are those events that never formed a part of the will of the parties, such as the extraordinary increase in crude oil prices at the international level.\" Exhibit CE-50, Bill of the Law amending Hydrocarbons Law, presented by President Palacio to the President of Congress, 1 March 2006 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 01721.\n\nIn this arbitration, Perenco, as was its right, chose not to engage in that debate, preferring instead to stand on its view of its contractual rights, which did not explicitly refer to any expected return on investment. In its Reply, the Claimant characterised these as \"assumptions\", \u2018\"variables\u2019 in a hypothetical model\" not to be confused with contractual terms: \"Nowhere in the Block 7 or Block 21 Contracts did Oryx \u2018agree\u2019 that the contractor\u2019s IRR would not exceed 15% or 22%.\" Reply, paragraph 479.\n\n394.\n\nIn the end, if Perenco wished to rely on clauses 11.12/11.7, respectively, it was incumbent upon it to make its case with appropriate documentation at that time and its failure to have done so is fatal to this part of its claim.\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered whether, Perenco\u2019s having failed to prove the futility of the modification process at the time, the Tribunal should take on the task of attempting to substitute itself for the parties in the contractual modification process. After careful reflection, the Tribunal does not think it necessary or appropriate in the circumstances to pursue the issue of whether or not Law 42 at 50% affected the economy of the Contracts. It might well have, but if that was what the Claimant considered, the procedure in clauses 11.12 of the Block 7 Contract and 11.7 of the Block 21 Contract was there to be pursued.\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s additional reasons for declining to divine what might have happened in a negotiation are threefold. First, the taxation modification clauses required the parties to determine the predicate for making a change to their respective entitlements, i.e. an agreement that the new or modified tax had an impact on the contract\u2019s economy. They would do so on the basis of the data submitted by the private contractor in its capacity as the party moving for a change to the contract. The parties would then determine the tax\u2019s impact on the contract\u2019s economy and calculate an adjustment to absorb that impact. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the clauses dictated the objective, but not the precise means of correction and this could only be determined through negotiations that arrived at a mutually agreeable outcome (or, if such negotiations foundered, thereafter by a tribunal armed with all of the relevant documentation produced by both parties during the negotiations).\n\n397.\n\nThis leads to the second point. While, as discussed above at paragraph 393, the Tribunal can conceive of the kinds of considerations that would have motivated the parties in the negotiations, with the passage of time and the absence of critical contemporaneous data, it would be wholly speculative for the Tribunal to try to estimate what the parties would have done. Based upon the pleadings and expert reports filed in this arbitration, the Tribunal can make a guess as to the kinds of arguments that both sides would have advanced, but in the end it is only a guess.\n\n398.\n\nFinally, the single most important piece of evidence that would necessarily have to be submitted during the negotiations - the analysis that Perenco prepared in order to demonstrate Law 42\u2019s impact on the Contracts - has not been produced to the Tribunal.629 This is the seminal piece of evidence in the whole evaluative exercise.\n\nInstead of filing this contemporaneous document, Perenco submitted an expert report prepared for this arbitration by Professor Joseph P. Kalt. The Tribunal did not find that report to be of assistance to its consideration of the present question because when it came to modelling the impact of Law 42 on Perenco\u2019s 2000 Block 21 Development Plan, for example, Professor Kalt looked at Law 42 as if it had applied at the 99% rate from the date of Perenco\u2019s acquisition of its interests in the Contracts. This counterfactual analysis shed no light on the actual situation prevailing from the date of Perenco\u2019s operation of the blocks up to the beginning of 2007 - the period of time with which the Tribunal is presently concerned. Professor Kalt acknowledged during cross-examination that he had not performed a calculation of Law 42 at 50%. Transcript, Hearing on Merits, Day 7, p 1646 *et seq.*\n\n399.\n\nIn the end, the Tribunal is left with an untested contractual modification process and an invitation in the form of a breach of contract claim that it insert itself into a negotiation process that could be conducted only by the parties to the contracts armed with all of the relevant financial information. The Tribunal considers that given these factors, and without having the contemporaneous evidence before it, it cannot seek to replicate and adjudge what would have occurred had Perenco pressed for the modification negotiations.\n\n400.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal holds that: (i) Law 42 fell within the taxation modification clauses of both Contracts; (ii) as the party claiming that the law had an impact on the Contracts\u2019 economy, it was incumbent upon Perenco to pursue negotiations with the new administration at least until they were shown to be futile; and (iii) Perenco did not do so, preferring instead to adopt a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach with the new Correa Administration. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not find a breach of clauses 11.12 and 11.7 of the two Contracts.\n\n401.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises that in requiring Perenco to demonstrate futility in order to succeed on this point it might be regarded as applying too exacting a requirement; but issues such as that which faced Perenco in late 2006, early 2007 frequently arise in commercial affairs and they require difficult decisions to be taken. In the end, Perenco chose not to press its rights, considering instead that it \"would be prudent to wait a little bit to see whether things would settle down so [that it] could arrange a talk.\"630 It was of course entitled to do so, but it cannot then argue that insisting on its clause 11 rights, which had been so recently shown to be effective, was futile. At the end of the day, the clauses were not tested and found wanting. This part of Perenco\u2019s claim is therefore dismissed.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Merits, Day 2, pp 523-524 (Testimony of Lament Combe).\n\n**(6) Law 42 at 99%**\n---------------------\n\n402.\n\nThe situation in relation to the application of Decree 662 to Perenco is entirely different because of the magnitude of the \"extraordinary revenues\" claimed by the State and the demands made around the time of the decree\u2019s promulgation and thereafter that Perenco migrate to a service contract. In this respect, the Tribunal found Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s analysis of the constraints that Ecuadorian law places on the exercise of the *jus variandi* power to modify an administrative contract to be of assistance.631 Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose asserted that the power could only be exercised in certain ways and subject to certain limits.632\n\nAlthough he initially resisted characterising the Participation Contracts as \"administrative contracts\", Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose ultimately conceded that they could be considered as such: Transcript, Hearing on Jurisdiction, Day 2, pp 165-166, and Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, pp 1498-1499.\n\n1st Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 37-40 and 57. Professor Aguilar did not take issue with Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s reliance on the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* as applying generally to administrative contracts, and did not address the latter\u2019s characterisation of the power of *jus variandi.* However, since Professor Aguilar did rely upon the Constitutional Court\u2019s view that the *pacta sunt servanda* rule broke down in relation to the Participation Contracts\u2019 economic terms, argued that the power to vary contracts extends to the financial-economic equation, and argued further that the right to seek a rebalancing of the contract inheres in both parties, not just the contractor, it is clear that he took a different view of the law than Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose on these key issues (3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 34 *et seq.)*\n\n403.\n\nThe principal such limit, in his view, was that the unilateral power to modify administrative contracts existed only in relation to their \"non-economic aspects.\"633 In his view, the power must therefore be considered to exist only in relation to the performance of the administrative contract (i.e., the specification of the contractor\u2019s duties) and could not apply to the economic bargain struck by the parties.634\n\n1 st Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 41.\n\n1st Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 39.41.\n\n404.\n\nDr. P\u00e9rez Loose asserted further that the exercise of the power was subject to four conditions which he extracted from the writings of civil law theorists such as Ra\u00fal Granillo Campo, Hector Escola, and Miguel Marienhoff635:\n\n(i) the changes must have a reasonable justification (\"in other words, they must not respond to a \u2018deviation of power\u2019\"636);\n\n(ii) the changes cannot distort the contract\u2019s very objective;\n\n(iii) the contracting entity must respect constitutional guarantees that could be affected by its decision to amend the contract; and\n\n(iv) if the exercise of *jus variandi* negatively affects the economic rights of the contractor, the entity must compensate the contractor, in such a way that the stipulated price does not change.637\n\nOnly within these limits, in his view, could the administration lawfully exercise the *jus variandi* power.\n\n1st Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, footnotes 43-47.\n\n1st Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 38.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n405.\n\nThe Constitutional Court has spoken on limbs (iii) and (iv) of this four-limbed test. The Court decided that Law 42 was \"fully subject to the rules of the [2008 Constitution]\" (although this finding was made prior to the promulgation of Decree 662 and the Tribunal cannot know what the Court\u2019s view of that decree might have been).638 Given the limits on this Tribunal\u2019s contractual jurisdiction, its duty to apply the governing law, and the Court\u2019s determination of Law 42\u2019s constitutionality (at least as of September 2006), the Tribunal proceeds on the basis that the law was constitutional. Hence limb (iii) of Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s test is deemed to be satisfied. As for limb (iv), it must yield to the Constitutional Court\u2019s finding that the Participation Contracts\u2019 financial-economic equilibrium could be modified.639\n\nExhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Law 42, p 27.\n\n*Ibid.,* p 24.\n\n406.\n\nTurning to limbs (i) and (ii) of the test, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, these types of issues were not considered by the Court (and obviously could not have been considered because the Court\u2019s judgment pre-dated Decree 662 by over a year). The Tribunal accepts Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s opinion that these two limbs are recognised by Ecuadorian law.\n\n407.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Law 42 at 99% constituted a breach of contract. Having regard to limb (i), in the Tribunal\u2019s view, there was no possible reasonable justification for the State to claim 99% of \"extraordinary revenues\" above the reference price. While the nature of a \"deviation of power\" is not precisely defined, the writings of the civil law theorists cited by Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose indicate that it concerns the misuse of power.640 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Decree 662 constituted an act of coercion when viewed within the context of the parties\u2019 contractual relations and therefore it can be regarded to be a deviation of power.\n\nExhibits CA-113 Granillo Ocampo, Ra\u00fal, Distribuci\u00f3n de los Riesgos en la Contrataci\u00f3n Administrativa (1990), p 92, and CA-125 Marienhoff, Miguel, Tratado de Derecho Administrativo, Tomo III-A (1978), p 402.\n\n408.\n\nEcuador did not dispute that Decree 662 was intended to prompt re-negotiations with oil companies. Around the time of the Decree\u2019s promulgation, the Administration began to speak of converting participation contracts into service contracts.641 This became a major theme in the Administration\u2019s discussion of hydrocarbon exploitation contractual modalities. In his national address on 23 January 2008, for example, President Correa framed the State\u2019s actions as intended to return the contracts to \"a services contract which always should have been the preponderant figure in the oil industry.\"642 In its written pleadings in this arbitration the Respondent described Decree 662 as *\"a true incentive for petroleum companies operating in Ecuador to negotiate a new contractual framework* that would provide a fairer allocation of the petroleum rent.\"643\n\nThe Administration\u2019s statements about converting contracts to service contracts prompted Perenco to write to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum on 24 October 2007 requesting a copy of the service contract to which companies were expected to migrate. (Exhibit CE-265, Letter from the Consortium to Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, 24 October 2007 (in Spanish with English translation)).\n\nExhibit CE-67, Excerpt from the 53rd National Address of President Raphael Correa, San Miguel de Salcedo, 26 January 2008. Reply, paragraphs 287-292.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 625 [Emphasis added.].\n\n409.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the application of Decree 662 and the statements of senior officials in relation thereto signaled a new phase in the State\u2019s relationship with Perenco (and the other oil companies in similar circumstances). This was no longer a question of the State seeking an adjustment of an otherwise acceptable contractual relationship which, in its view, had been disrupted by price increases of an unanticipated magnitude. Rather, Law 42 at 99% unilaterally converted the Participation Contracts into *de facto* service contracts while the State developed a new model of such contracts which it demanded the contractor to sign.644\n\nIn the 53rd National Address, given on 26 January 2008, President Correa stated that the oil companies would have three choices: comply with the payment of 99% of the \"extraordinary income\", renegotiate their participation contracts by migrating to a service contract, or leave the country. Exhibit CE-67, Excerpt from the 53rd National Address of President Raphael Correa, San Miguel de Salcedo, 26 January 2008.\n\n410.\n\nLimb (ii) was also violated. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, as of 4 October 2007, Perenco\u2019s Contracts were participation contracts in name only; Decree 662 completely modified the Contracts\u2019 objective as it was understood under Ecuadorian law. It follows that Decree 662 cannot be justified as a lawful exercise of the *jus variandi* power under Ecuadorian law.\n\n411.\n\nThus, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, in moving beyond 50% up to 99% the Respondent breached the Participation Contracts. Whatever might have transpired in clause 11 negotiations on the impact of Law 42 at 50% on the Contracts\u2019 economy (had they occurred), moving from 50% to 99%, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, was no longer an attempt to claim an equitable distribution of the windfall revenues generated by an unexpected and significant increase in oil prices, and could not be justified under the applicable Ecuadorian legal standards for the exercise of the *jus variandi* power.\n\n**(7) The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures and the defence of** ***exceptio non adimpleti contractus***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nPerenco argued that the Respondent committed a further, independent breach of contract in failing to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures.645 This issue assumes importance because if Ecuador was contractually obliged to comply with the decisions of the Tribunal during the course of the arbitration and it failed to do so, the next question would be whether that breach entitled Perenco to treat Ecuador\u2019s non-compliance as a basis for its reciprocal non-compliance when it announced that it would suspend operations.646\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, paragraph 79; Revised Memorial, paragraphs 222-226, in particular 224; see also, Reply, paragraphs 507-509. See above at paragraphs 277 to 279, 340 and 354.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 212.\n\n*a. Was Ecuador contractually obliged to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n413.\n\nThe analysis of this issue starts with the parties\u2019 agreement reflected in clause 22.2.2 of the Contracts that they would \"use the means set forth in [the Contract] to resolve doubts and disputes that may arise during its life, and likewise *to observe and comply with the decisions of the competent...arbitrators,* judges or tribunals, as the case may be, pursuant to the provisions of this Contract.\"647 As far as the contract claim is concerned, Perenco argued that Ecuador assumed a contractual obligation to comply with all decisions of an arbitral tribunal, including this Decision on Provisional Measures.648 Perenco\u2019s contention was that given the economic impact of Law 42, then at 99%, it was entitled as a matter of Ecuadorian law to suspend its performance of the Contracts until such time as Ecuador brought itself into compliance.649\n\nClauses 22.2.2 of CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract and CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract [Emphasis added]. The Tribunal notes that in the original Spanish, the relevant terminology is *\"observas y cumpli\u00f3\"* and *\"decisiones\"* (CE-10, PER 04724; CE-17, PER 04865). Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose asserted that this provision reflected the general approach in Ecuadorian law to the binding power of decisions of an arbitral tribunal: under Article 9 of the Arbitration and Mediation Act in Ecuador \"arbitrators may grant injunctive relief in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure provisions, or the relief deemed necessary...\" His interpretation of this provision is that it demonstrates that arbitrators are not required to be accorded a separate and specific power to grant injunctive relief, in order for parties to be bound to comply: \"The mere agreement to submit disputes to arbitration is sufficient to bind the parties not only to comply with the award but also to comply with provisional measures.\" (4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 28.)\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 30. In addition to clause 22.2.2 of the Contracts, Perenco relies on clause 22.2 and 20.3 of the Block 21 and Block 7 Contracts, respectively, which in its submission incorporate the ICSID Convention into the Contracts and by which the parties unambiguously undertook to resolve specified disputes through ICSID arbitration. Perenco submitted that the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* was applicable to the agreement to arbitrate recognised in these provisions, and as such, there was an obligation on Ecuador to comply in good faith with \"its contractual obligation peaceably to resolve disputes like this one through ICSID arbitration\", in addition to its contractual obligation to observe and comply with any resulting decision of the ICSID tribunal. Its actions amounted to a breach of both contractual obligations: Revised Memorial, paragraphs 223 and 225. 4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 17 to 35. Reply, paragraph 509.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 122-123, 127 and 133; 4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 36-59.\n\n414.\n\nHad it done so, the argument went, Perenco would then not have been required to pay Law 42 dues to the State during the pendency of the arbitration, Ecuador would not have commenced the *coactiva* proceedings to seize Perenco\u2019s oil and sell it in satisfaction of the claimed Law 42 debt, Perenco would then not have suspended operations, and the grounds for the Contracts\u2019 ultimate termination by declaration of *caducidad* arising out of that suspension would not have occurred.650\n\nCounter-Memorial, section 6.3.2 (Ecuador\u2019s actions in alleged breach of the dispute resolution provisions of the Participation Contracts were not causative of any loss to Perenco); Rejoinder, paragraphs 418 and 421.\n\n415.\n\nEcuador\u2019s position is that while the parties undertook in the Contracts to submit to ICSID arbitration specified disputes and to abide by the Tribunal\u2019s *\"final* award\", they did not undertake to, and these obligations could not inferentially amount to, an undertaking to comply with a tribunal\u2019s recommendation of provisional measures.651 It submitted that clause 22.2.2 was generally worded and, according to principles of contract interpretation in Ecuadorian law, must be \"read in accordance with the other clauses of the Participation Contracts which specifically refer to these topics\" and which in its view establish \"only that the Parties agree to abide *by the final award* rendered by an ICSID tribunal.\"652 Where it was intended to give a tribunal the power to provide for binding and enforceable provisional measures, the Contracts did so expressly (as was done elsewhere in the Contracts with respect to the power of a domestic arbitral tribunal to order provisional measures).653\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 448 [Emphasis added.]; Rejoinder, paragraphs 422-425.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 450 [Emphasis in original].\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n416.\n\nEcuador argued further that in any event its actions in alleged breach of the dispute resolution provisions of the Contracts did not cause any loss to Perenco as it could have continued to operate the Blocks and made a choice to suspend operations in July 2009.654 Ecuador drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to its earlier direction in the Decision urging the parties to establish an escrow account such that Perenco would pay the \"sums so accruing into [the]... account[\u2026]\"655 In the Respondent\u2019s view, Perenco\u2019s willingness to pay Law 42 dues at 99% into such an account showed that the \"forced sale of oil to recoup the 2008 Law 42 dues left Perenco in no different economic position than would have prevailed had the Parties acceded to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s recommendation of provisional measures.\"656\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 452 to 458; Reply, paragraphs 254 to 266.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, paragraph 63.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 455 and 457.\n\n417.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, a plain reading of clauses 22.2.2 indicates that the contracting parties agreed that they would comply not only with a final award (i.e., in Spanish, the *\u2018laudo\u2019* issued by a tribunal), but in addition, they would observe and comply with the decisions (i.e., in Spanish, the *\u2018decisiones\u2019)* of the tribunal.657 The latter term constitutes a more capacious category of tribunal decisions of which the final award forms a part. Thus, under the Participation Contracts, Ecuador was bound to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures and its failure to do so constituted a breach of contract.\n\nExhibits CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, and CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract. The Tribunal notes that in the original Spanish, the relevant terminology is *\"observas y cumpli\u00f3\"* and *\"decisiones\"* (see CE-10, PER 04724; CE-17, PER 04865).\n\n*b. Can Perenco invoke the defence of* exceptio non adimpleti contractus *for its decision to suspend operations?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nHaving found such a breach by Perenco\u2019s counterparty, one requisite element of the defence of *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* (the defence of non-performance) is established. This then requires the Tribunal to determine whether Perenco is correct to argue that as a matter of Ecuadorian law it was entitled to respond to this breach by suspending performance of its contractual obligations.658\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 57.\n\n419.\n\nDr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s evidence was that Perenco was entitled to invoke the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* defence.659 (And following from this, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose submitted that Ecuador could not claim that it was justified by Perenco\u2019s suspension of operations to subsequently declare the Contracts terminated by operation of *caducidad)660*\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 55 to 57.\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 58.\n\n420.\n\nDr. P\u00e9rez Loose asserted that a corollary of the proposition that the principle of *pacta sunt servanda* fully applied to administrative contracts is that a contractor faced with a situation of non-performance by the public contracting entity may pursuant to Article 1505 of Ecuador\u2019s Civil Code \"go before a judge or arbitrator, as applicable, to request either: (a) that he declare the contract terminated, or (b) that he order the other party to stop violating the contract and comply as was agreed.\"661 Under either option, the contractor has the right to claim damages.662 In any event, faced with a material breach, the private contracting entity is entitled to withhold performance of its own contractual obligations, recognised in Ecuadorian law under Article 1568 of its Civil Code and known as the \"defense of the unfulfilled contract\" or by its Roman law expression, *\"exceptio non adimpleti contractus\"663*\n\n1st Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 22-28; citing a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice in Ecuador at CA-54, Supreme Court of Justice, *Tecco,* Judicial Gazette Series XIV, No. 3, pp. 679-687.\n\n1st Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 23. Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose asserted that Perenco did not waive this right, in the Participation Contracts or by submission to Ecuadorian law: \"Neither does the Hydrocarbons Law or the Law on Public Procurements, or any other law, prohibit oil contractors such as Perenco from exercising this right.\" (Paragraph 25).\n\nP\u00e9rez Loose, 4th, paragraph 36.\n\n421.\n\nArticle 1568 of Ecuador\u2019s Civil Code provides more generally that \"[i]n bilateral contracts no party shall be considered to be in default by failing to comply with the agreed terms, while the other party has not complied with its obligations or refuses to comply in due manner and time.\"664 During cross-examination, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose asserted that in his view Article 1568 must apply to administrative contracts since it makes no distinction in terms between private and administrative contracts, referring only to the generally worded \"contracts.\"665 He referred to the defence as a \"transitory\" or \"transient\" right666 intended to exert pressure on the other contracting party to comply with its contractual obligations.667 In order to invoke this defence, the invoking party must demonstrate: (i) a reciprocal connection between the obligation breached and the obligation it purports to breach;668 (ii) that the original breach was material in nature (it cannot relate to ancillary, secondary, or obligations relatively insignificant in the larger context of the legal relationship between the parties);669 and (iii) that it was or is ready to perform its obligations.670\n\nCA-296, translated into English at paragraph 36 of the 4th expert report of Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, p 1507.\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 37.\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 38-39.\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, footnote 45: \"[t]his does not mean that the obligations necessarily be performed concurrently, but that there should be a correlation between the obligation breached by Claimant and that which he requires the other party to perform. Attention should be paid for this aim not only to the nature of the contract but to what the parties have freely agreed.\"\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, footnote 46, where he noted that the breach must not have been provoked by the other party\u2019s actions, and the obligation breached must be material such that otherwise relying on the remaining performance of the contract will not be sufficient to compensate for the breach.\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 41.\n\n422.\n\nWhile he asserted that the defence of *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* applies equally to administrative contracts as it does to private contracts in Ecuador, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose acknowledged some limitations.671 He noted early resistance to applying the defence at all to administrative contracts because it was necessary to encourage continuity in contracts which commonly provided for the provision of public services, rather than to grant the contractor a right to interrupt performance if it considered itself justified by the other party\u2019s failure to perform its contractual duties.672\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 42-54.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n423.\n\nHe asserted, however, that this position has \"eased into a less rigid stance,\" recognising that the State is party to many contracts unrelated to public services. This was the case with the Participation Contracts in this arbitration, and the contractor party to such an administrative contract may invoke the defence if requiring it to continue performance would result in its suffering \"serious economic consequences\".673 He relied on two decisions of the First Civil and Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of Justice in Ecuador674, two opinions from the Attorney-General\u2019s office in Ecuador permitting private contractors to postpone performance without penalty under their contracts with a State entity that had defaulted in payments to it,675 and the writings of civil law theorists such as Marienhoff, Dromi and Cassagne, to support his view that the defence applies to administrative contracts, and may be invoked when the State\u2019s conduct results in a situation that renders it prejudicial for the contractor to perform its obligations.676 (The threshold of prejudice quoted by Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose in an excerpt from Marienhoff is \"reasonable inability\", instead of \"serious economic consequences\" which was Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s characterisation of the test in his fourth expert report.677)\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 44-45: \"It is now accepted that in this area the contractor cannot be required to perform his obligations despite the contracting entity\u2019s breach if such a requirement might result in serious economic consequences for the contractor.\"\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 53-54.\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 52, referring to CA-319, Official Letter PGE No. 004400 of 11 January 2011, and CA-320, Official Letter PGE 13841 of 5 May 2010.\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 46-50.\n\n4th Expert Report of Hernan P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraphs 46 to 50.\n\n424.\n\nFor his part, while Professor Aguilar accepted that Article 1568 of the Civil Code and the defence of *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* is of \"mandatory application in the field of Private Law,\" he rejected the view that it applied equally in the case of contracts entered into by State entities, asserting that it is \"only applicable in *extraordinary circumstances* in the field of Administrative law.\"678 He cited French,679 Spanish680 and Argentinean681 legal theorists to this effect; and passages quoted from their administrative law textbooks suggested that the *exceptio* did not carry over, without qualification, to administrative contracts because of the imperative of ensuring continuity of performance under public contracts.682 He submitted that the texts of civil law theorists relied upon by Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose in his fourth expert report, namely Marienhoff, Dromi and Cassagne, may use the phrase *exceptio non adimpleti contractus,* but in their explanation of the doctrine they were actually referring to the \"existence of a *force majeure* that excuses the contractor from fulfilling its obligations.\"683\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraph 82 [Emphasis added.]. Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose in cross-examination highlighted that in his view it was significant that Professor Aguilar was not rejecting the application of *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* to administrative contracts, contending only that it applied under \"exceptional circumstances.\" Transcript, Hearing Day 6, pp 1502, line 16 to 1503, line 4.\n\nJean Rivero, *Derecho Administrativo,* Caracas, Universidad Central de Venezuela, 1984, p 137 (3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, Annex 63): \"If the administration is in default, the private law rule that allows the other party to protect itself by opposing the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* to suspend the performance of its duties is discarded, and the private party is still obliged to perform, regardless of the administration\u2019s default : it can only have resort to the courts to claim compensation for damages and injuries, or request rescission in the event of serious default.\" [Emphasis in original.]\n\nEduardo Garcia de Enterria y Tom\u00e1s-Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez, *Curso de Derecho Administrativo,* Madrid, Civitas, 2001,Vol. I, p 753.

However, performance of the contract must prevail, and therefore a transfer of the referenced *exceptio* to the field of administrative contracts is not only incompatible with the basics of administrative contracting, but contrary to the public interest in jeopardy.\" [Emphasis in original.]\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 83 to 86, 98 to 100: (paragraph 99) \"...continuity in contractual performance is considered a highly regarded value which must be protected, because if performance satisfies a collective need, its suspension would affect this need and, therefore, harm society as a whole.\"\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 88-90.\n\n425.\n\nProfessor Aguilar asserted further that the writers supported his view that the *exceptio* can only apply to administrative contracts in circumstances where the State\u2019s conduct has made it \u2018reasonably impossible\u2019 for the private contracting entity to fulfill its obligations.684 It is pertinent to note in this regard that Professor Aguilar corrected the relevant threshold articulated by Marienhoff and cited by Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose; stating that Marienhoff used the phrase \"reasonable *impossibility\"*, rather than \"reasonable *inability\"* as noted above.685 Professor Aguilar cited as an example of \"reasonable impossibility\" the situation in which a moratorium in the payment of the amounts owed by the administration to the contractor is \"extended in time and is of such nature that it grossly undercapitalizes the contractor and leaves it without the necessary resources to execute the works entrusted.\"686\n\n*Ibid.* Professor Aguilar adopted the term \"impossibility\". He referred to Dromi\u2019s use of \"reasonable impossibility\" in a sentence which he asserted followed the passage excerpted in the 4th Expert Report of Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose, paragraph 48.\n\n3rdExpert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraph 89: \"Marienhoff argues that the *exceptio* would apply \u2018in favor of the contracting party when the Administration\u2019s conduct translates into a \u2018reasonable impossibility\u2019 for said party to fulfill its obligations\u2019.\" In the original Spanish text (CA-335, at p 380) the term used by Marienhoff is *\"razonable imposibilidad\".* The same can be said for Dromi (3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, Annex 60, p 384 of the original text) who uses the term *\"una razonable imposibilidad de cumplir con las obligaciones contractuales\"* in a section titled *\"[s]uspensi\u00f3n de la ejecuci\u00f3n y \"exceptio non adimpleti contractus.\"*\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraph 87.\n\n426.\n\nProfessor Aguilar accepted that his view was derived from the views of foreign legal theorists, but asserted that this was necessarily the case as \"[t]here has been no explicit development in Ecuador by authors on the subject, nor has a concrete case presented itself that resulted in applicable jurisprudence.\"687 He rejected Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s reliance on two judicial decisions of the First Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, stating they demonstrated instead that a claim invoking the *exceptio* will not be entertained when the private contractor is itself in default of its contractual obligations.688 He similarly asserted that contrary to Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s submission, the two opinions of the Attorney-General in Ecuador demonstrate that the *exceptio* may be invoked by the private contracting entity to an administrative contract, there was in one case a specific contractual provision providing that no fine would be imposed on the contractor for non-performance if the public contracting entity was in default, and the other case supports his view that the *exceptio* did not apply as the \"Attorney General argues that a delay in payment by a public institution does not authorize an extension of the contractual term\" in favour of the contractor (i.e., permitting non-performance for a time until payment is received).689\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 91.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 91 to 93.\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 94 to 95. During the hearing, on cross-examination, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose acknowledged that in the first case there was a contractual provision that permitted the contractor to stop fulfilling its obligations if there was non-fulfillment by the administration. He stated that he still found this case to be useful because there was an opportunity for the Attorney General to say that for administrative contracts, the *exceptio* was not to be applied, but this is not what the Attorney General did. As for the second case, which concerned a contract for the sale of medicine, on cross-examination it was suggested to Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose that this was a private contractor, not an administrative contract, as he had suggested in his opinion. He conceded that it could be characterised as such. He also agreed that in both cases the *exceptio* was invoked by the public sector rather than by the private sector, but maintained that this did not mean that it was not available to the private contractor. (Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, pp 1513, line 3 to 1514, line 15, and pp 1517, line 12 to 1518, line 6.\n\n427.\n\nProfessor Aguilar asserted further that his position was buttressed by the fact that it is analogous to the approach to contractual breach under statutory law in Ecuador; first, under Article 96(1) of the National Public Contracting System Law which establishes that breach by the public contracting entity for a duration of more than 60 days entitles the contractor only to terminate the contract, and second, under Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law which does not permit breach by the public contracting entity to be raised as a defence by the private contractor in proceedings leading to the declaration of *caducidad* (although, as Professor Aguilar later noted, it does permit that defence in proceedings for *caducidad* if suspension of operations is by reason of *force majeure).690*\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 96 to 97, 102.\n\n428.\n\nThe Participation Contracts, in Professor Aguilar\u2019s view, were contracts where continuity of performance was imperative and was recognised as such by their own terms691 and by Ecuadorian constitutional law.692 In his opinion, recognition of hydrocarbons activity as being of public utility suggested that there was a \"need to grant priority to contractual continuity over the application of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus\"* to these Contracts.693 Accordingly, he asserted that it would be inappropriate to permit the application of the defence.\n\nReferring to Clause 5.1.3 of the Block 21 Contract: \"Without prejudice to any other obligations specified in the Contract, the Contractor undertakes to:...commence operations, within the first six months from the Effective Date, and continue to perform the operations in the Contract Area.\"\n\n3rdExpert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 96 to 97, 109. Professor Aguilar asserted that nonrenewable natural resources are recognised as one of the strategic sectors of the State under Article 313 of the Constitution, and continuity as a characteristic of the sector to be pursued by the National Hydrocarbons Directorate in its mandate under Article 11 of the Hydrocarbons Law. Moreover, Article 326(15) of the Constitution \"prohibits paralyzing, amongst other services and activities, hydrocarbon production.\"\n\n3 rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraph 107.\n\n429.\n\nFinally, Professor Aguilar asserted that even if the *exceptio* was applicable, rather than permitting the suspension of its contractual obligations it would at best permit Perenco to demand compliance with, or termination of, the Contracts.694 He referred in this respect to the two judicial decisions of the First Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice as cited by Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose. While Professor Aguilar admitted they applied the *exceptio* (though in his view not in the way Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose sought to rely on them) he asserted that \"[i]n both decisions, judges reason that the plaintiffs, both private persons, could not bring claims against the State because they were in default of their contractual obligations. In other words, the contracting party\u2019s breach authorized filing a claim, but could not authorize a failure to fulfill its contractual obligations.\"695\n\n3rd expert report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraph 114: \"...[it] does not constitute an authorization to breach the contract. Quite on the contrary, the exception intends to prevent the defaulting party from demanding due performance from its counterparty.\"\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 114 to 116.\n\n430.\n\nIn addition to its view of the restrictions on the defence\u2019s availability, Ecuador asserted as a matter of fact that even if *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* applied, it would require Perenco to demonstrate that the impugned conduct rendered it impossible for it to fulfill its own obligations. This Perenco could not do since during the provisional measures phase of the proceeding it informed the Tribunal and Ecuador that it was able and willing to pay the amounts claimed by Ecuador under Law 42 (then at 99%) into an escrow account maintained in a neutral location.696 Ecuador argued that if Perenco could operate under Law 42 at 99% by paying the disputed dues into escrow, it could equally operate by paying the dues to the Government. This demonstrated that Perenco could pay Law 42 dues and that it was not forced to discontinue performance of the Contracts by reason of the alleged breach.697\n\nExhibits CE-72, Letter from Perenco and Burlington to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador proposing an escrow account for transfer of disputed Law 42 payments, 19 June 2008 (in Spanish and English); CE-215, Letter from Perenco to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, regarding proposed settlement agreement, 27 May 2009 (in Spanish with English translation). See also, Counter-Memorial, paragraph 496.\n\n3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 82 to 117.\n\n431.\n\nHaving considered the parties\u2019 submissions, although it accepts Professor Aguilar\u2019s view that the law is not well developed in this point in Ecuador, the Tribunal finds that the defence may be invoked by a private party to an administrative contract. Article 1568 of the Civil Code is worded in general terms and does not support the position that it may only be invoked by the public contracting entity that is party to the contract.\n\n432.\n\nThe next issue is whether it was \"reasonably impossible\" (the test according to the theorists cited by Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose) for Perenco to comply with the Contracts during the time that its oil was being seized by Ecuador. The Tribunal considers that the test is concerned with \u2018commercial impossibility\u2019 in the circumstances of the particular contracting party. The initial hurdle Perenco must overcome is whether it was commercially impossible for it to carry on operations in accordance with its contractual rights and obligations.\n\n433.\n\nIn this regard, Perenco faced two issues. First, by expressing its interest in the opening of an escrow account into which the Law 42 dues would be paid, Perenco seemed to consider that it could continue to operate both blocks while paying Law 42 dues. Second, if it overcame the first hurdle, Perenco had to then show that Professor Aguilar was incorrect in arguing that the remedies afforded by Ecuadorian law extend to suspension of the plaintiff\u2019s own obligations and not just court proceedings seeking termination or damages.\n\n434.\n\nAfter reviewing the fact and expert evidence, the Tribunal considers that Perenco has made out the \"commercial impossibility\" argument. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the dispute\u2019s having been submitted to ICSID arbitration, the Tribunal\u2019s then having made the provisional measures recommendation in order to avoid the dispute\u2019s aggravation, and Perenco\u2019s having had a contractual expectation that Ecuador would comply with such a decision, it was entitled to rely on the prospect of the non-enforcement of the *coactivas* aimed at collecting past sums claimed to be owing or new sums generated by Perenco\u2019s exploitaiton of the Blocks during the pendency of this arbitration. When the *coactivas* were applied to Perenco\u2019s production, it became commercially impossible for the company to carry on business because its production was being seized in order to be sold (at a discount to the prevailing market price) in order to pay the debt, while it simultaneously continued to incur Law 42 debt at the market price. For every barrel of oil seized and sold by Ecuador, a new debt was being incurred under the application of Law 42. In all of the circumstances, carrying on production at a loss amounted to \u2018commercial impossibility\u2019.\n\n435.\n\nAs for the second point, the Tribunal considers that Ecuadorian law permits the party that is not in breach to suspend performance of its obligations until such time as the party in breach brings itself into compliance. Accordingly, the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* defence was open to Perenco.\n\n**(8) Was there a breach of clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Participation Contract?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Participation Contract provides:\n\n\"The parties understand that the treatment received by the Contractor both by the Government of Ecuador as well as by PETROECUADOR *shall not he less* *favorable than that in similar conditions by other Participation Contractors for the Exploration and Exploitation of Elydrocarbons,\"698*\n\nExhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04772 [Emphasis added.].\n\n437.\n\nThe Claimant contends that by exempting another contractor, Andes Petroleum, from the application of Law 42 with respect to its participation contract for the Tarapoa Block,699 Ecuador breached clause 5.1.28. Ecuador\u2019s response is two-fold, first, contesting the admissibility of the claim since it was advanced for the first time by the Claimant in its Reply, and second, submitting that Perenco has failed to discharge its burden of proving that Perenco and Andes Petroleum were \"in similar conditions\", that there was differential treatment that was otherwise unjustified, and that Ecuador intended to favour Andes Petroleum.\n\nExhibit CE-12, Tarapoa Block Participation Contract.\n\n438.\n\nOn the matter of the claim\u2019s admissibility, the Tribunal cannot accept Ecuador\u2019s submission that the claim was submitted out of time. Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide that \"an incidental or additional claim...arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute\" \"shall be presented *not later than in the reply\"700* It is uncontested that the claim was raised in the Reply, and the Tribunal accordingly finds that this objection is unfounded and the claim is admitted for its consideration.\n\nRule 40(1) and (2) (Ancillary Claims) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n439.\n\nOn the matter of the merits of the claim of breach, the Tribunal considers that Perenco has failed to prove that it and Andes Petroleum were in \"similar conditions\" as far as their respective participation contracts were concerned. When Ecuador and City Investing Company (Andes Petroleum\u2019s predecessor) entered into the Modification Contract for the Explotad on and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in the Tarapoa Block on 25 July 1995,701 they agreed to supplement their clause 8.1 with the following proviso:\n\n\"If the Contract Area crude oil price exceeds seventeen dollars per production unit, the profit surplus from the price\u2019s real increase (calculated over 1995 constant values) will be distributed among the parties in equal shares.\"702\n\nExhibit CE-12, Tarapoa Block Participation Contract.\n\nExhibit CE-12, PER 00727.\n\n440.\n\nWhether Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations should apply to the Tarapoa Block Participation Contract was the subject of a formal opinion requested of Ecuador\u2019s Attorney-General Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n in July 2008 by the then-President of Petroecuador Rear-Admiral Luis Jaramillo. In his opinion of 18 July 2008 the Attorney-General noted that the objective of Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations was to address \"non-negotiated and unforeseen windfall\" profits.703 In contrast, in the case of the Tarapoa Block Participation Contract, the parties had considered the event of windfall profits and had turned their minds to an agreed approach to addressing that eventuality.704 The Attorney-General concluded:\n\n\"In light of the foregoing, in the specific case of the Participation Contract for the Tarapoa Block, in force with Andes Petroleum Company Ltd., Law 2006-42 amending the Hydrocarbons Law is not applicable, given that the contract already assures participation for the Ecuadorian state in the economic profits earned from an increase in the price of crude oil exploited in that field.\n\nAs regards the distribution percentage, the Participation Contract in effect, which constitutes law for the contracting parties and cannot be modified other than by their agreement, in accordance with the principle established by article 1561 of the Civil Code - *which applies to the Contract since it is subject to Ecuadorian legislation, as stipulated in Clause 22.1 -* has established a distribution modality equivalent to what is provided in Law 42, which should be applied in the case of this contract, to the benefit of the principle of legal certainty for the parties.\n\nWith Law 2006-42 not applicable to said contract, which expressly refers to the windfalls from the oil sales prices not negotiated or unforeseen in the Participation Contracts, the regulations for said law issued through Executive Decrees numbers 1672 published in the Second Supplement of the *Registro Oficial* no. 312 dated July 13, 2006; and 662 published in *Registro Oficial* no. 193 dated October 18, 2007 also do not apply.\"705\n\nExhibit CE-75, Opinion of Ecuador\u2019s Attorney General regarding the non applicability of Law 42 to the Tarapoa contract, 18 July 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 02223, quohng from Decree No. 1672.\n\nExhibit CE-75, Opinion of Ecuador\u2019s Attorney General regarding the non applicability of Law 42 to the Tarapoa contract, 18 July 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 02223-02224.\n\nExhibit CE-75, Opinion of Ecuador\u2019s Attorney General regarding the non applicability of Law 42 to the Tarapoa contract, 18 July 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 02224 [Italics in original.]\n\n441.\n\nThis is evidence of the State\u2019s considered evaluation of whether Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations should apply to the Tarapoa Block Participation Contract. The Tribunal considers that the evidence shows that Perenco and Andes Petroleum were not in \"similar conditons\" and therefore the required comparator is not present. The Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proving that there was unfavourable treatment accorded to it when compared to another company in similar conditions. This claim is therefore dismissed.\n\n**(9) Caducity under the Contracts**\n------------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it most efficient to address the issue of caducity after its discussion of the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim. As shall be seen, the Tribunal considers that the declaration of *caducidad* effected an expropriation and by parity of reasoning, it constituted a breach of the Block 21 Contract because, in all of the circumstances, having occupied the blocks and safeguarded the State\u2019s interest in maintaining the oilfields and ensuring continuity of operations, without dispossessing Perenco of its contractual rights, Ecuador need not have brought the Contracts to an end.\n\n**E. Summary of Tribunal\u2019s findings on contract claims**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n443.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal finds that (i) Law 42 modifed the operation of the Contracts and fell squarely within the taxation modification provisions of the two Contracts; (ii) Perenco has failed to make out a breach of contract in relation to Law 42 at 50% due to its decision not to press its contractual rights and its failure to demonstrate that the clause 11 remedy was futile in the circumstances prevailing around the time of its request; and (iii) Perenco has made out its claim that at 99%, Law 42 breached the Contracts.\n\n**VII. JURISDICTION OVER CLAIMANT\u2019S TREATY CLAIMS**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The remaining jurisdictional question under the Treaty**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n444.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal left open the question of whether Perenco Ecuador Limited has standing to bring the claim under the Treaty.706\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 86.\n\n445.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that the Claimant was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.707 It is the fourth company at the lowest rung of a \"ladder\" of Bahamian companies with the company at the top of the ladder being PIL.708 At the time of his death, the late Hubert Perrodo, a French national, owned 92.9% of the shares of PIL. The remaining 7.1% shares are owned by another Bahamian company, Glenmor Energy Limited,709 which in turn is wholly owned by Mr. Perrodo\u2019s eldest son, Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo.710\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 3.\n\nDue to a corporate reorganisation, the names of various companies in the ladder have changed. For example, what is now Perenco International Ltd was Perenco Limited in 2006. Similarly, what was Perenco S.A was formerly Perenco Oil and Gas S.A. Perenco Gabon S.A was formerly Perenco S.A: See Letter from Debevoise & Plimpton to Dechert dated 8 July 2009, enclosing letter from Debevoise & Plimpton to ICSID dated 28 May 2008 at Exhibit E-l to Amended Request\n\nExhibit E-6 to Amended Request, Register of Members of Perenco Limited, Perenco S.A., Perenco Gabon S.A., and Perenco Ecuador Limited.\n\nExhibit CE-252, Register of Members of Glenmor Energy, undated, p 1.\n\n446.\n\nAlthough it dismissed the primary limb of the Respondent\u2019s objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear the Treaty claims in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal deferred its consideration of certain issues pending the filing of additional evidence and further submissions by the Parties. In doing so, the Tribunal expressed two concerns.\n\n447.\n\nFirst, it observed that this appeared to be the first time in which a juridical person, a national of a third State, had invoked treaty rights held and obligations owed by the Treaty parties without there being at least one national of one of the two State parties to the Treaty (or a juridical person incorporated under the law of one of the two State parties) joining to claim under the Treaty.711 It observed further that it was beyond dispute that ordinarily a Bahamian company could not claim rights under a bilateral treaty to which the Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a stranger.712\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 90.\n\n*lb id.,* paragraph 91.\n\n448.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal was somewhat surprised at the lack of affirmation from any French national, i.e. any heir of the late Mr. Hubert Perrodo, to the effect that such national, either individually or collectively with other French nationals, now controlled PIL and through it the Claimant.713 In the circumstances of the case, therefore, the Tribunal considered that the evidence of claimed control by French nationals that had been adduced by the Bahamian company by the time of the jurisdictional hearing was meagre.714\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 90.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 104-106. The Claimant was directed to file further evidence in support of its averment that it is controlled by Mr. Perrodo\u2019s heirs.\n\n449.\n\nSecond, with respect to the second limb of its objection to the treaty claim, the Respondent had advanced the argument that the word \"controlled\" used in Article l(3)(ii) of the Treaty in relation to the word \"companies\" meant \"any body corporate\" that was *directly* controlled by nationals of a Contracting Party and did not extend to any body corporate that was *indirectly* controlled by such nationals.715 At the jurisdictional hearing, the Respondent conceded that if it was proved that French nationals controlled PIL, the company at the top of the ladder of Bahamian companies, then that Bahamian company - but, it insisted, *only* that Bahamian company - had the requisite standing to bring a claim under the Treaty because it was the only company that could be said to have been *directly* controlled by the Perrodo family, assuming that they were able to discharge the burden of proving that they did indeed control that company.716\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 74-79.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Jurisdiction, Day 1, p 212\n\n450.\n\nDuring the earlier jurisdictional phase, some argument was led in respect of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Treaty and the Tribunal decided to defer its decision on the direct/indirect control issue for the time being.717 Given that the Respondent apparently had little in the way of the negotiating history within its possession and without expressing a view as to whether it was appropriate or not in the circumstances to have recourse to supplementary means of interpretation pursuant to Article 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the **\"Vienna Convention\"** or the **\"VCLT\"),** the Tribunal instructed the parties to approach the French authorities with a view to obtaining any *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* and to return to this issue in the next phase of the proceeding in the light of any such negotiating history.718\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 86.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 94-95.\n\n451.\n\nAfter receiving the further written submissions and evidence from the parties, the Tribunal was in a better position to make a proper determination of the remaining jurisdictional issues.\n\n**(1) Key factual findings**\n----------------------------\n\n452.\n\nBefore discussing the objections in detail, it is necessary to consider the facts as they emerged from the written and oral testimony of witnesses tendered by the Parties.\n\n453.\n\nAt the oral hearing in The Hague held from 8 to 16 November 2012, Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, Mr. Roland Fox, and Mr. Patrick Spink all testified as to the issue of the control of Perenco Ecuador Limited both during the late Mr. Hubert Perrodo\u2019s lifetime and after his death.\n\n454.\n\nWith respect to the question of whether or not *as a matter of fact* at the material time (17 October 2007)719 the Perrodo family controlled PIL, and through PIL and two other interposed companies, the Claimant, the following key points warrant noting.\n\nOn 17 October 2007, Perenco notified Ecuador that it accepted and gave its consent to the offer by the Respondent to submit any dispute relating to any measure which may affect the Claimant\u2019s investments in Ecuador to ICSID: see Amended Request for Arbitration dated 30 April 2008, paragraph 15.\n\n455.\n\nThe evidence of Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo was that after his father\u2019s untimely death on 29 December 2006, he had to assume the leadership of the Perenco Group and on 12 January 2007 was appointed Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors of PIL.720 In both his written and oral testimony, he maintained that after his father\u2019s death, he and his family controlled PIL, which in turned controlled the subsidiary companies, including Perenco Ecuador Limited, in that significant decisions affecting the Perenco Group or any Group company were made only with the Perrodo family\u2019s approval.721 Mr. Perrodo stated that he continued to follow his late father\u2019s management practices in that the directors, officers and managers of the various Perenco Group of companies would consult with him and seek his approval for all kinds of matters, \"including potential acquisitions or dispositions, important contracts, commencing or terminating relationships with partners, investment decisions, key personnel, relations with governments and many other issues.\"722\n\nWitness Statement of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, paragraph 4.\n\nWitness Statement of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, paragraph 11.\n\nWitness Statement of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, paragraph 13. This factual evidence is a critical premise of the Claimant\u2019s position on its standing to pursue claims under the Treaty: see Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, pp 176-177 (Opening Statement of Mr. Friedman).\n\n456.\n\nDuring his oral testimony, Mr. Perrodo stated that his father\u2019s only heirs were his mother, Mrs. Ka Yee Perrodo, and her three children, Nathalie Samani (n\u00e9e Perrodo), Bertrand Perrodo, and himself.723 There are no other descendants entitled to make a claim of an interest in the estate.724\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, p 419 (Testimony of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo).\n\n*Ibid., p* 419 and 423(Testimony of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo).\n\n457.\n\nMr. Perrodo acknowledged that there was a dispute between his mother and her children as to how the estate should be divided.725 Since her husband had died intestate, Mrs. Perrodo had argued that under the applicable matrimonial regime, 15% of the estate had belonged to her while her husband was alive.726 This would have a significant impact on the percentage share of the estate that each heir would receive once the estate was administered.727 As a result of this dispute, on 15 February 2008, Mrs. Perrodo, on the advice of counsel, lodged a caveat in the Bahamian courts. (This was later withdrawn, on 30 March 2009.)728\n\n*Ibid.,* pp 420-422 (Testimony of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo).\n\n*Ibid.,* pp 422-423 (Testimony of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo).\n\n*Ibid,* p 419 (Testimony of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo).\n\n*Ibid.,p* 421 (Testimony of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo).\n\n458.\n\nMr. Perrodo testified further that the dispute between the heirs in no way impeded the management of the Perenco Group.729 It had always been clear that Mrs. Perrodo and the other two Perrodo children completely entrusted him in the running of the company as Executive Chairman.730\n\n*Ibid.,p* 423 (Testimony of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n459.\n\nThis evidence was consistent with that of Mr. Roland Fox who testified that at all times the Perrodo family controlled the Perenco Group.731 When Hubert Perrodo was alive, he maintained tight control over the Perenco Group,732 and this was manifested by his ability as sole shareholder to appoint senior management and the Board of Directors of PIL.733 All decisions relating to the Perenco Group were made with Mr. Perrodo\u2019s approval.734 He was succeeded by his son Fran\u00e7ois when he was appointed Chairman of PIL shortly after his father\u2019s death.735 The authorised signatories on PIL\u2019s bank accounts were changed to give Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo the authority to transact on those accounts on the basis of his signature alone.736 On 24 September 2007, his mother, Ka Yee, and his sister, Nathalie, were also appointed Directors of PIL's Board.737\n\n1st Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 21; 2nd Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 5.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 22\n\n1st Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 25.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 24.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 28; Transcript, Day 2 at p 393, lines 3-9.\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 6.\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 7.\n\n460.\n\nMr. Fox testified further that as of 17 October 2007, six of the nine Directors of PIL\u2019s Board were French nationals, consisting of the three Perrodo family appointees and three others, namely, Bernard Castanet, Patrick Reynis and Jean-Michel Runacher.738\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n461.\n\nMr. Fox testified further that Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, as Chairman of the Board, was and has remained personally involved in all the significant decisions affecting the Perenco Group, and also consults his family before making such decisions.739 No significant decision would be taken without his approval.740\n\n1st Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 29.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 30. Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, p 394, lines 4-7.\n\n462.\n\nMr. Fox further testified that the Perrodo family controlled Perenco Ecuador Limited **(\"PEL\").** He himself was the President of PEL, which also had two Bahamian Directors. Day-to-day management of PEL was the responsibility of the Ecuador General Manager, supervised by the Regional Manager, but all material and strategic decisions were first brought to the attention of Hubert Perrodo, and after his death, to Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo.741\n\n1st Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 33.\n\n463.\n\nMr. Fox averred that Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo has made significant decisions affecting PEL, including approving PEL\u2019s expenditures in the country, its annual work programme and budget, and how to react to the actions of Ecuador which were considered to be detrimental to PEL\u2019s operations in Ecuador.742\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 3 5.\n\n464.\n\nTwo other aspects of Mr. Fox\u2019s testimony warrant note. The first relates to the shareholding of PIL at the time of Hubert Perrodo\u2019s death. Mr. Fox confirmed that at the time of Mr. Hubert Perrodo\u2019s death, the entire share capital of PIL amounted to 97,414 shares of which Hubert Perrodo owned 90,498 shares, equivalent to 92.9% of the total issued share capital of PIL, and Glenmore Energy Ltd, owned by Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, owned the remaining 6,916 shares equivalent to 7.1% of PIL\u2019s share capital.743\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 2.\n\n465.\n\nMr. Fox testified that in his role as Company Secretary of PIL, he was advised by Mr. Patrick Reynis, a French lawyer on PIL\u2019s Board, that the 90,498 shares in PIL formed part of Hubert Perrodo\u2019s estate and that under French law, upon his death they became immediately and indivisibly owned by his four heirs.744 He testified further that on December 22, 2011, the PIL shares that the heirs jointly owned were divided such that each of the four members of the Perrodo family ended up owning 25% of the total issued share capital of PIL.745 On this date, the transfer and re-registration of 24,353.5 shares were registered in each of the names of Ka Yee Perrodo, Nathalie Samani and Bertrand Perrodo. Some 17,437.5 shares were registered in the name of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo because he already owned 6,916 shares through Glenmor.746\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 3 ; Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, pp 373 - 375.\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraphs 9-10.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 9-10.\n\n466.\n\nAnother aspect of Mr. Fox\u2019s testimony that warrants note concerned his view as to the voting rights attached to the shares of PIL. In this regard, he testified that in the period between Mr. Perrodo\u2019s death and the time that the PIL shares were transferred and re-registered on 22 December 2011 - the period in which the consent to ICSID arbitration was given by PEL -although the shares were held indivisibly by the heirs, there were no voting rights attached to them because nobody was in a position to vote on them.747 Accordingly, from his perspective as the Company Secretary, Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo\u2019s indirect 7.1% shareholding in PIL gave him the right to determine shareholders\u2019 decisions until the other shareholders had been registered.748 The Tribunal will revert to his testimony on this point below.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, pp 401-403, 407 (Testimony of Roland Fox).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n467.\n\nMr. Patrick Spink also testified as to the issue of control exercised by both Hubert Perrodo and Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo over PIL and PEL.\n\n468.\n\nHe testified that the Perrodo family\u2019s control extended to more than just acquisitions and that they had a \"decisive say over matters as diverse as capital expenditures, relationships with business partners, annual budgets, personnel and other matters.\"749 Mr. Spink also gave evidence as to Hubert Perrodo\u2019s control over PEL, and the investment in Ecuador, which he said was directly supervised by Hubert Perrodo.750\n\n2nd Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraph 5.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 6.\n\n469.\n\nThe expert opinion of Mr. Bernard Reynis, a French notary called by the Claimant, addressed the immediate devolution under French law of interest in Hubert Perrodo\u2019s estate upon his death to his surviving spouse and descendants.751 Mr. Reynis testified that under French law, in the absence of any last will and testament by the deceased and in the presence of a surviving spouse and descendants, the estate reverts to the surviving spouse and his descendants (i.e. the heirs).752 The heirs are vested immediately with \"capacity\" in relation to their interest in the estate \"without any need for formalities or \u2018probate\u2019 proceedings such as those used in common-law jurisdictions.\"753\n\nExpert Report of Bernard Reynis, paragraphs 8-9.\n\nExpert Report of Bernard Reynis, paragraph 9; Transcript, Heaming on the Merits, Day 5, pp 1297 and 1299 (Testimony of Mr. Bernard Reynis).\n\nExpert Report of Bernard Reynis, paragraph 10; Transcript, Heaming on the Merits, Day 5, pp 1297 and 1299 (Testimony of Mr. Bernard Reynis). Similarly, another expert witness for the Claimant, Mr. Brian Simms QC, testified that, in his view, the heirs were immediately vested with title to the shares in PIL and could have registered the shares at any time, and in any event, for all relevant purposes the heirs were treated as shareholders: Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, pp 1130-1131 (Testimony of Mr. Brian Simms QC).\n\n470.\n\nMr. Reynis added that where there are numerous heirs, this results in the creation of a joint ownership, and \"[d]uring the joint ownership period, the coheirs hold title to and exercise control over the entire estate, which includes shares of stock held by the deceased in a corporation at the time of death, jointly and indivisibly.\"754 This testimony was consistent with Mr. Fox\u2019s evidence that from his perspective as Company Secretary, the shares were held indivisibly by the heirs. It was also consistent with the Claimant\u2019s position that immediately upon the death of Hubert Perrodo, the Perrodo heirs owned PIL, and through that, PEL.\n\nExpert Report of Bernard Reynis, paragraphs 10-11; Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 5, p 1302 (Testimony of Mr. Bernard Reynis).\n\n471.\n\nWhile the Respondent challenged certain aspects of the testimony of each of the foregoing witnesses, it did not successfully challenge the central points of the foregoing testimony going to the issue of the Perrodo family\u2019s control *in fact* of PIL (the issue of legal control will be considered separately below).\n\n472.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, six key factual findings can be made in this respect.\n\n473.\n\nFirst, after two rounds of oral hearings, each of which was preceded by two rounds of written pleadings, there is no evidence that the PIL shares did not form part of the Perrodo estate for the purposes of French law. There is no evidence, for example, that Mr. Perrodo created a testamentary or other trust domiciled outside of France which might have meant that the PIL shares did not form part of the estate which vested in the heirs under French law.\n\n474.\n\nRather, the evidence is that the shares of PIL *did* form part of the estate and in view of Mr. Perrodo\u2019s intestacy, they fell to devolve to the heirs in accordance with French law, as indicated in the *Acte de notori\u00e9t\u00e9* and Death Certificate of Hubert Perrodo prepared by Mr. Bernard Reynis on 11 June 2007 (as further confirmed by Mr. Reynis\u2019 expert report filed in this proceeding).755\n\nExhibit CE-200, *Acte de notori\u00e9t\u00e9* and Death Certificate of Hubert Perrodo prepared by Mr. Bernard Reynis (in French with English translation) (also submitted as part of the Claimant's Exhibit RFA-CE-6 on 1 November 2010 and attached to the Expert Report of Bernard Reynis as Exhibit 1).\n\n475.\n\nSecond, while evidence emerged which showed that the surviving heirs of Mr. Perrodo disputed their respective shares of the estate (a fact which Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo freely acknowledged under cross-examination756), no evidence was adduced to contradict the Claimant\u2019s position that, under French law, the ownership of the estate vested in the heirs immediately upon Mr. Perrodo\u2019s death. The Respondent did not seek to contradict Mr. Reynis\u2019 expert opinion on French law and its operation in this fashion was accepted by the Respondent\u2019s expert on Bahamian law, Mr. Brian Moree QC, as an assumption for his opinion.757\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, Testimony of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo at p 419.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, p 1426, lines 8-10 and 1st Expert Report of Brian Moree QC, p 3.\n\n476.\n\nThird, no evidence was adduced to suggest that any other person of French or of any other nationality came forward to contest the heirs\u2019 collective entitlement to the estate. It is true that on 15 February 2008, Madame Perrodo filed a caveat in the estate of Hubert Perrodo in the Supreme Court of the Bahamas758, but this was explained by Mr. Perrodo as an act taken out of an abundance of caution by his mother and in light of the then-brewing dispute between the heirs.759 There is no record evidence that any other party - of French or of any other nationality - contested the Perrodo heirs\u2019 entitlement to the estate.\n\nExhibit E-72, Caveat filed in the Supreme Court of The Bahamas by Carrie (evidently an Anglicisation of Ka Yee) Perrodo in the Estate of Hubert Perrodo, dated 15 February 2008.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, p 420, lines 5-11 (Testimony of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo).\n\n477.\n\nFourth, the consistent evidence of the Perenco officers and management was that there was no doubt amongst the Board or the senior officers of the company as to the Perrodo family\u2019s ownership and continued control of PIL after Mr. Perrodo\u2019s death. Mr. Fox testified that in light of the advice he had received from a French attorney on the board, management did whatever it could to facilitate the transition in the company\u2019s governance.760\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, pp 384-385 (Testimony of Roland Fox).\n\n478.\n\nIn this respect, as already noted, on 12 January 2007, some 14 days after Mr. Perrodo\u2019s death, Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo was elected to the Board of PIL and appointed its Chairman.761 The officers of the Perenco Group testified that they then consulted with Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo in the same way in which they had previously consulted his father.762\n\nWitness Statement of Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, paragraph 4.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Roland Fox, paragraph 29; 2nd Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraph 4.\n\n479.\n\nFifth, Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo also had an existing 7.1% shareholding interest in PIL through his ownership of Glenmor.763 This shareholding was unaffected by his father\u2019s death and continued unabated during the period in which the heirs\u2019 respective entitlements to the estate were contested. (There is some debate between the Parties as to whether or not the shares of the late Mr. Perrodo were \"disabled\" from voting until such time as they were re-registered, and if so, whether Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo therefore controlled PIL by virtue of his company being the only shareholder with the ability to cast a vote at any general meeting of PIL held during the time that the other shares had not been distributed and registered the names of the heirs.) It should be noted that Mr. Moree QC objected to using the term \"disabled\" - his point being that the rights still existed but there was no one to exercise them.764\n\nExhibit CE-252, Register of Members of Glenmor Energy, undated, p 1.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, pp 1481-1482 (Testimony of Brian Moree QC).\n\n480.\n\nSix, approximately nine months after Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo assumed the chairmanship, he was joined on PIL's Board by his mother and sister.765 Thus, when, on 17 October 2007, the Claimant wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum purporting to accept Ecuador\u2019s offer to submit the dispute to ICSID pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 9 of the Treaty, three of the four surviving heirs of Hubert Perrodo were members of PIL\u2019s Board.766\n\nExhibit CE-199, Board of Directors Meeting Minutes of Perenco International Ltd, 24 September 2007.\n\nExhibit CE-264, Letter from Perenco Ecuador Ltd to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum.\n\n481.\n\nThe evidence, therefore, as to the *fact* of the heirs\u2019 control of PIL, the company at the top of the ladder of Bahamian companies, is substantial and, in respect of the foregoing, not seriously contested and indeed un-contradicted in a number of instances.\n\n482.\n\nHowever, it also remains a fact that what plainly had *not* occurred either at the time that the Claimant consented to ICSID arbitration with Ecuador on 17 October 2007 or on 30 April 2008 when the Board of Directors of Perenco S.A. (now PIL) authorised the filing of the Requests for Arbitration with ICSID, was the registration of the shares previously owned by Hubert Perrodo in the names of the heirs. It was not until 22 December 2011 that Letters of Administration were taken out in the Bahamas directing that the heirs be registered as shareholders of PIL in the proportions agreed by the heirs.767 This of course is one of the principal remaining objections, to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\nExhibit CE-294, email correspondence between Mr Roland Fox and Ms Heather Thompson, enclosing instructions from the Perrodo heirs, 22 December 2011.\n\n**(2) Submissions on the issue of control**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n483.\n\nQuite apart from the issues of fact in respect of which it adduced additional evidence on the issue of control, the Claimant argued against the Tribunal\u2019s placing any reliance upon what it considered to be \"incomplete\" parts of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* as they were said to provide no definitive interpretative guidance.768\n\nThe Claimant described the *travaux* as \"incomplete\" and providing \"no definitive interpretative guidance\": See paragraph 28 of the Reply. At the hearing, counsel for the Claimant described the *travaux* as \"...fragmentary and incomplete. There is in these *travaux* no comprehensive memo of the negotiations, no agreed understandings or Protocols underlying the Treaty, no guides as to why certain language was used or not used. Instead, what Ecuador invites you to do is to look at a couple of drafts with handwritten markings on and imagine what might have been in the minds of the negotiators, and from that impose a limitation on the ordinary meaning of the perfectly clear terms.\" Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, p 165, lines 16-22, p 166, lines 1-3.\n\n484.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent filed what was available in terms of the *travaux* (while also complaining that it was evident that the Claimant already had the documents at the time of the earlier jurisdiction proceedings).769\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 105.\n\n485.\n\nThe Respondent asserted that the *travaux* supported the view that the changes between the original initialled draft and the final text that was signed and ratified by the parties were substantial and the clear interpretative inference to be drawn was that the State parties agreed that a legal person incorporated under the law of a third State would have standing to bring a claim only if it was directly controlled by nationals of one of the two Contracting Parties.770\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 99-100, 103-104, 107-111.\n\n486.\n\nSince the Claimant was not directly controlled by French nationals but rather by a Bahamian company, the Respondent argued it follows that it lacked the requisite standing to bring the present Treaty claim.771\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 136-137.\n\n*a. The Respondent \u2019s objections*\n---------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s objections that were not disposed of by the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, the Respondent\u2019s case as it stands can be summarised as follows:\n\n488.\n\nFirst, it is clear that the Perrodo heirs had not taken the steps required by Bahamian law to acquire legal title to the shares at the time that consent to ICSID arbitration was given by the Claimant.\n\n489.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s submission, whatever may be said about their ownership of the shares under French law and the fact that Bahamian law recognised their beneficial interest in the PIL shares772, as a matter of Bahamian law, since they were not registered as shareholders, they lacked the power to participate as shareholders in PIL at the crucial date of consent, and therefore were not in a position to control that company. On this analysis, it was not until December 2011 that they were, as a matter of Bahamian law, in a position to control PIL.773\n\n1st Expert Report of Brian Moree QC, paragraph 6, states that \"under Bahamian Law, the heirs only have an equitable right to the shares pending their registration as the owners of the shares.\"\n\nOn 22 December 2011, the heirs of Hubert Perrodo were formally registered as shareholders of PIL. See exhibit CE-294, email correspondence between Roland Fox and Heather Thompson, enclosing instructions from Perrodo heirs, 22 December 2011.\n\n490.\n\nThe Respondent thus contends that in the absence of the ownership of legal title of the shares, PIL itself was not controlled by French nationals and it follows therefore that PEL - which would derive its right of standing from its being controlled by PIL and it in turn being controlled by French nationals - likewise lacks standing to bring the Treaty claim.774\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 84-88.\n\n491.\n\nSecond, the Respondent reaffirms what was originally the second limb of its objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. This objection exists independently of whatever may be decided in respect of the first objection in that even if it is accepted that the Perrodo heirs controlled PIL at the material time, PIL is not the claimant in this arbitral proceeding. Rather, the claim has been brought by a Bahamian company which is separated by three layers of Bahamian companies and is therefore not directly controlled by the Perrodo heirs. The immediate, controlling parent of the Claimant is Perenco S.A. and it is not a French company or national.775\n\nExhibit CE-6 to Amended Request, Register of Members of Perenco Limited, Perenco S.A., Perenco Gabon S.A., and Perenco Ecuador Limited.\n\n492.\n\nThe essence of the Respondent\u2019s argument in respect of the second objection is that while the phrase \"directly or indirectly\" was used in connection with \"controlled\" in the first draft of the treaty negotiated in 1986 - a phrasing that was consistent with the approach taken in French bilateral investment treaty-making practice, that was *not* what was ultimately signed and ratified by the two States in 1994.776\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 99.\n\n493.\n\nThe 1986 draft followed the French model BIT which provided that \"companies\" included \"... toute personne morale constitu\u00e9e sur le territoire de l\u2019une des Parties contractantes, conform\u00e9ment a la l\u00e9gislation de celle-ci y poss\u00e9dant son si\u00e8ge social, ou contr\u00f4l\u00e9e *directement ou indirectement* par des nationaux de l\u2019une des Parties contractantes...\".777 Likewise, the draft initialled in October 198 6778 similarly provided in Spanish that \"...toda persona jur\u00eddica constituida en el territorio de una de las Partes Contrantes conforme a su legislaci\u00f3n y que posea en el mismo su domicio social, o controla *directa o indirectamente* por nacionales de una de las Partes Contratantes...\".\n\nSee Exhibit E-55, Projet d\u2019Accord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement sur l\u2019Encouragement et la Protection R\u00e9ciproques des Investissements, UNCTAD, International Investment Instruments: A Compendium, Volume VI, 2001 [Emphasis added].\n\nExhibit E-56, Letter from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Ecuadorian Ambassador in France dated 16 October 1986 enclosing the Draft Treaty between France and Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments [Emphasis added].\n\n494.\n\nHowever, this is not what the final text states. It is common ground that the 1986 draft text was not finalised and ratified by the two States.\n\n495.\n\nAfter a hiatus of some 8 years, negotiations between France and Ecuador resumed. By that time, Ecuador had developed its own model BIT and the approach taken by that instrument was to confine the standing to bring a claim upon natural persons who were nationals of either of the two Contracting Parties and legal persons that were incorporated under the law of either of the two Contracting Parties and whose seat was located in the territory of a Contracting Party.779 On this approach, legal persons incorporated under the law of a third State would have no standing to bring a claim.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 113, E-56, Letter from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Ecuadorian Ambassador in France dated 16 October 1986 enclosing the Draft Treaty between France and Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (PER 03541).\n\n496.\n\nThe Respondent emphasised that consistent with this approach, Ecuador had concluded a bilateral investment treaty with the United Kingdom which also contained a different model for establishing the standing of legal persons shortly before the resumption of negotiations with France.780 That Treaty defined \"companies\" as \"corporations, firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of the United Kingdom\" or \"legal persons constituted in accordance with the law in force in the Republic of Ecuador.\"781 The Treaty essentially adopted a \u2018place of incorporation\u2019 test in accordance with the relevant laws of the Contracting Parties rather than a \u2018control\u2019 test and thus did not contemplate legal persons incorporated in the law of third States having rights of standing by virtue of their being controlled by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties. A document, evidently prepared by French officials prior to the resumption of negotiations with Ecuador in 1994, referred to the UK treaty and noted the different requirements for the standing of legal persons.782\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, pp 220-221 (Opening Statement of Mr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n).\n\nExhibit E-62, Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Ecuador for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 10 May 1994 and entered into force on 24 August 1995, Article 1.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, p 221 (Opening Statement of Respondent).\n\n497.\n\nTwo undated draft texts which evidently preceded the final version of the Treaty were also submitted. Each contained handwritten annotations that either deleted or inserted text. The first undated draft includes handwritten marks in the definition of \"companies\" as follows:\n\n\"the term \u2018companies\u2019 shall designate i) Any legal entity organized in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, in accordance with its legislation, and that ~~possesses~~ **has** its corporate domicile within the same; or ii) ~~if it is~~ Any **legal entity** controlled directly (or indirectly) by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties\"783 [Handwritten additions in bold, deletions indicated by strikethrough]\n\n*Travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* in Claimant's Possession as of 5 August 2011 at CE-188 at PER 03573.010.\n\n498.\n\nIn the second undated draft of the treaty, the relevant paragraph has the words \"directly\" and \"indirectly\" crossed out:\n\n\"companies shall designate // i) Any legal entity organized in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties, in accordance with its legislation, and that has its corporate domicile within the same; or // ii) Any legal entity controlled ~~directly or indirectly~~ by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties [,..]\"784\n\n*Ibid,* at PER 03573.002.\n\n499.\n\nIn the end, the Treaty signed by France and Ecuador contained a different expression of control than the prior drafts or the 1986 initialled version. The words \"directly or indirectly\" were omitted and, as noted above, the phrase \"directly or indirectly\" was inserted into the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(1). It warrants noting that unlike the then-recently concluded Ecuador-UK Treaty, the Treaty did not restrict rights of standing to legal persons incorporated under the law of either of the Contracting Parties, but in addition conferred standing on legal persons incorporated under the law of a third State, provided that such legal persons were \"controlled\" by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties.\n\n*b. The Claimant \u2019s submission*\n-------------------------------\n\n500.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s submission in response to this objection can be summarised as follows:\n\n501.\n\nFirst, it submitted that on the undisputed facts in the record, Perenco is a company \"controlled\" by French nationals within the meaning of Article l(3)(ii) of the Treaty and has been recognised as such by Ecuador.785 Ecuador\u2019s position that the Treaty\u2019s use of the term \"control\" required \"legal control\" and could not extend to the case where the Perrodo heirs had not as yet obtained Letters of Administration in the Bahamas, was \"premised on a limiting and formalistic definition of \u2018control\u2019 that [was] contrary to the more flexible and fact-dependent approach that international law adopts\".786 The Perrodo family was in fact in control of the Perenco Group both when Hubert Perrodo was alive and after his death.787 In particular, Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo was appointed Chairman of PIL and was significantly involved in decisions relating to the management of the Perenco Group, including that of Perenco.788 Moreover, at the date of consent to arbitration, the Perrodo heirs collectively owned 100% of the shares in PIL and this was sufficient to establish \"control\" over the company (and through that, its wholly-owned subsidiary).789 The fact that the Perrodos\u2019 shareholding had not been formally registered in their individual names could not detract from the fact that under French law, upon Hubert Perrodo\u2019s death, his ownership of 92.9% of PIL\u2019s shares automatically vested in his four heirs jointly - they owned the shares.790\n\nReply, paragraphs 7, 10.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 10; Reply, paragraphs 10, 63, 66-68.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 75- 79; Reply, paragraphs 12-14, 64, 75-78.\n\nReply, paragraphs 17 and 75 (\"Immediately following Hubert\u2019s death on 29 December 2006, the PIL Board took steps to ensure that the family\u2019s formal control did not lapse. At an emergency meeting on 12 January 2007, approximately two weeks after Hubert passed away, the Board officially recognized Fran\u00e7ois as the new head of Perenco. On that date, the Board appointed Fran\u00e7ois as a director and as Chairman of the company with immediate effect. It also transferred authority to transact \u2018any or all business\u2019 involving Perenco\u2019s bank accounts from Hubert to Fran\u00e7ois, so that Fran\u00e7ois was the only member of the Board of Directors authorized to execute transactions on the basis of his signature alone.\").\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 80; see also, Reply, paragraphs 80-89.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 83; Reply, paragraph 14.\n\n502.\n\nPerenco asserted that even if the Tribunal were to proceed on the narrow approach to control advocated by Ecuador, Perenco was nevertheless legally controlled by French nationals as of 17 October 2007 because approximately 7.1% of the shares in PIL were owned by Glenmor Energy, which in turn, was wholly owned by Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo.791 This entitled Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo to vote on decisions taken by the management of PIL, even if it was assumed that the beneficiaries of the Perrodo estate could not vote in respect of the shares vested in Hubert Perrodo.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 90- 9; Reply, paragraphs 10 and 17.\n\n503.\n\nFinally, Perenco submitted that the Government of Ecuador has repeatedly and consistently referred to Perenco as a French company.792 It referred to statements by President Correa, Minister Derlis Palacios and Ecuador\u2019s Attorney General in February and March 2009, where they referred to Perenco as a French company, and the brewing dispute as having implications for its relationship with the French Government.793 Ecuador\u2019s representatives met with French government representatives, not Bahamian representatives.794 Perenco submitted that \"[a]s Prof. Schreuer has explained, under 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, \u2018the host State\u2019s awareness of [the] objective fact [of foreign control] over a local company\u2019 is an element of a control analysis\", and that \"the host State\u2019s awareness of the nationality of foreign controllers has been a decisive factor in ICSID jurisprudence.\"795\n\nReply, paragraphs 99-104.\n\nReply, paragraph 100.\n\nReply, paragraph 101.\n\nReply, paragraphs 102-103, citing CA-373, Schreuer, p 314, paragraph 819; and ICSID jurisdictional decisions in *SOABI v. Senegal* (CA-166), paragraphs 45 and 53, and*African Holding v. Democractic Republic of the Congo* (CA-143), paragraph 101.\n\n504.\n\nSecond, Perenco contended that Ecuador\u2019s argument that the use of the word \"controlled\" in Article l(3)(ii) of the Treaty must be read to mean \"controlled directly\" should be rejected because it is \"refuted by the plain language of the Treaty, by pertinent components of its *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires,* and by prior investment treaty jurisprudence.\"796\n\nReply, paragraph 9.\n\n505.\n\nThe plain meaning of \"control\" did not, in Perenco\u2019s view, connote \"direct control.\"797 It encompassed both direct and indirect forms of control.798 It submitted that Ecuador had not offered the Tribunal one citation of a dictionary definition of the term which defined it as limited to \"direct control.\"799 Indeed, the definitions proffered confirmed that the ordinary meaning of control encompassed both direct and indirect forms of control.800 For example, a Black\u2019s Law Dictionary definition provided by Ecuador stated that \"to control is: To exercise power or influence over...To have a *controlling interest* in[\u2026]\"801 Perenco submitted that to exercise power or influence over a company could not reasonably be said to be \"limited to being its direct 100% shareholder.\"802 Moreover, Perenco challenged Ecuador for having failed to provide the full citation of the definition; that it followed on in the same page to refer to \"[t]he direct or indirect power to direct the management and policies of a person or entity whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise [...]\".803\n\nReply, paragraph 20.\n\nReply, paragraphs 18-20.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 21- 26; see also, Reply, paragraphs 21-26.\n\nReply, paragraph 21.\n\nReply, paragraph 21, quoting from Counter-Memorial, paragraph 120, in turn citing EL-79 [Emphasis in original.].\n\nReply, paragraph 21.\n\nEL-79, emphasis added by the Claimant. The Claimant also referred to French and Spanish legal dictionary definitions: \"The leading French legal dictionary, for example, defines the term *\"contr\u00f4l\u00e9\"* as applied to corporate entities as \"[t]he opportunity for a company to determine directly or indirectly, by means of rights or contracts, the policy of another company....\" *Vocabulaire juridique,* CA-178. Likewise, in Spanish, the noun \"control\" is defined as \"domain, order or preponderance.\" *Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola,* CA-179.\n\n506.\n\nPerenco argued that the *travaux* confirmed that the negotiating parties \"did not agree to limit the term \u2018control\u2019 to direct control.\"804 Perenco in the first instance submitted that recourse to the *travaux* was inappropriate because the text of the Treaty was in its view unambiguous, and that the *travaux* was incomplete and for this reason could not stand as definitive.805 In the second instance it submitted that if the Tribunal should see fit to refer to the *travaux,* it was significant that \"a proposal to limit explicitly the definition of \u2018company\u2019 to \u2018all juridical persons controlled directly by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties\u2019 was in fact rejected\".806 This was a reference to the two undated drafts described above at paragraphs 497-498, Perenco placing considerable emphasis on the handwritten qualification of the term \"for indirectly)\u2019\u2019 in the first undated draft, and then the altogether deletion of the phrase \"directly or indirectly\" in the second which ultimately was the version carried over into the final text.807 Perenco further contended that if \"the parties had wished to restrict the definition of \u2018company\u2019 as Ecuador proposes, they could also have adopted the formulation they inserted in Article 9 of the Treaty, which refers to a company \u2018a majority of whose shares were held, prior to the dispute, by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party... \"\u2019.808\n\nReply, paragraph 20.\n\nReply, paragraph 28.\n\nReply, paragraph 31.\n\nReply, paragraphs 32-35.\n\nReply, paragraph 41, referring to Exhibit CE-7, Treaty, PER 00522.\n\n507.\n\nMoreover, responding to Ecuador\u2019s contention that the insertion of the phrase \"indirectly or directly\" in the definition of \"investment\" and the simultaneous deletion of the same phrase from the definition of company informed its interpretation, Perenco submitted that \"[i]f the term \u2018investment\u2019 had not been expanded to include investments belonging \u2018indirectly or directly\u2019 to nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, then individuals holding an indirect *minority or non-controlling* interest in the investment would not have been covered by the Treaty\".809\n\nReply, paragraphs 43-44, 47-50 [Emphasis in original.].\n\n508.\n\nFinally, Perenco relied on what it termed \"a long line of investment arbitration jurisprudence holding that the term \u2018control\u2019 is to be construed expansively, in favor of jurisdiction\",810 citing *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s,811 Wena Hotels,812* and *Siemens.813* Perenco argued that they demonstrated an \"unwillingnesss to impose a requirement of \u2018direct\u2019 ownership or control where a treaty does not explicitly include that term.\"814 It further relied on decisions in *SOABI v. Senegal* and *AIG v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* characterising them as having recognised the \"incongruity of restricting the definition of \u2018control\u2019 where that term is unqualified given the complex structures of modern businesses, which frequently make use of intermediate holding companies in order to structure their investments optimally.\"815 To interpret the term in this case any differently would be \"unprecedented\" and would ignore \"commercial realities.\"816\n\nReply, paragraph 20.\n\nCA-168, Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 31-32 (denying the \"Respondents request to restrict the scope of covered investors through a control-test\".).\n\nCA-172, Decision on Jurisdiction, p 887.\n\nCA-165, Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 137.\n\nReply, paragraphs 54-55.\n\nReply, paragraph 55; CA-166, Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 37; CA-144, paragraph 9.4.8(3).\n\nReply, paragraph 56.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n509.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting that the State parties included the bare word \"controlled\" in the Treaty. Had they also retained the word \"directly\" only, the Respondent\u2019s objection would dispose of the Treaty claim. However, the deletion of the phrase \"directly or indirectly\" when referring to \"controlled\" does not materially differ from the unelaborated use of the word \"controlled\" in that, as the Claimant has shown with numerous examples, legal dictionaries commonly note that courts and tribunals will interpret the word \"control\" to extend beyond direct control to indirect control.817\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paragraph 11.\n\n510.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant is correct in asserting that the ordinary meaning of the term \"controlled\" encompasses direct and indirect control.\n\n511.\n\nThe Respondent contends that \"the interpreter\u2019s task under Article 31 of the VCLT is to select, from amongst the range of possible meanings of the word controlled, the ordinary meaning in the context of the Treaty as a whole.\"818 The Respondent accepts, however, that one of the possible meanings \"of the term control \u2018encompasses\u2019 both direct and indirect forms of control, including majority equity ownership\".819 Where it diverges from the Claimant is whether this is the correct meaning when the interpreter follows the Vienna Convention\u2019s requirement that it read the ordinary meaning of the word \"controlled\" in the context of the Treaty and in light of its object and purpose, and having regard to the Treaty as a whole.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, paragraph 26.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n512.\n\nIn this regard, it is significant that an object and purpose of the Treaty was to attract foreign investment and it is not unusual for foreign investors to use a variety of corporate vehicles to achieve the benefit of an investment. This must have been in the minds of the negotiating teams on both sides in finalising the Treaty and they chose to retain the possibility that a legal entity incorporated in a third State could claim standing under the Treaty.\n\n513.\n\nNevertheless, it can be accepted that on one reading of the Treaty, on the facts of this case, it could be concluded that the person that controls PEL is Perenco S.A., not the latter\u2019s ultimate parent company, PIL, or the Perrodo family. But given that the Respondent \"crossed the Rubicon\" when it conceded - as was entirely right and proper to do given the plain wording of Article l(3)(ii) - that PIL, even though a creature of Bahamian law, had a right of standing to bring a claim if it could show that it was controlled by the heirs, one can ask how the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose would be undermined by recognising a right of standing in one Bahamian company, but not in another which is plainly and indisputably controlled by the one which the Respondent was prepared to acknowledge did have standing.820\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 37-44.\n\n514.\n\nThe Tribunal will revert to the issue of legal title, but for the present it notes that the totality of the evidence, i.e. the Perrodo family\u2019s complete ownership of the estate under French law, Bahamian law\u2019s recognition of that ownership interest, the steps taken to permit three of the four heirs, in particular Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, to participate in the overall direction and control of PIL by means of membership in the board prior to PEL\u2019s consenting to ICSID arbitration, the eventual registration of all of the late Hubert Perrodo\u2019s shares in the names of the heirs, and ultimately the fact that there is simply no evidence of any other person(s) who asserted a claimed interest in the estate taken together is compelling evidence that, quite apart from their legal title to the shares, shows that the Perrodo family was in every other respect plainly the owners of PIL as a matter of fact and as a matter of French law before formalising such ownership as a matter of Bahamian law. In this sense, even though the heirs did not possess legal title to the shares, it is undisputed they were the owners of all of the estate, including the shares, under the law governing the distribution of the late Mr. Hubert Perrodo\u2019s estate.\n\n515.\n\nThis is not to diminish the significance of the fact that at the time that PEL provided its consent to ICSID arbitration none of the shares of PIL, except for the 7.1% shareholding owned by Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo\u2019s holding company, Glenmor Energy Limited, were owned by any of the Perrodos in the sense of their holding *legal* title to the shares.\n\n516.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal accepted the evidence of Mr. Brian Moree QC, as an accurate statement of Bahamian law. However, Mr. Moree QC also acknowledged that Bahamian law recognised French law as being the law applicable to the devolution of the estate, and further that until such time as the Letters of Administration applicable to the re-registration of shares owned by a person who died intestate was effected, under Bahamian law their ownership was deemed to be vested in a judge of the Supreme Court. He readily acknowledged that it was not open to a judge to in any way diminish the estate or distribute it other than in accordance with the law.821\n\nTranscript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, p 1481 (Testimony of Mr. Brian Moree QC).\n\n517.\n\nMr. Moree QC also agreed with the suggestion that the act of the Supreme Court in authorising the registration of the shares in the names of the heirs was ministerial and would have to be forthcoming in the event of adequate proof of their entitlement.822 He opined that the fact of registration is one of great legal significance in terms of vesting the shareholders with such rights as accrued to them under Bahamian company law.823 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is no doubt that this is the case.\n\n*Ibid.,p* 1482.\n\n*Ibid.,?* 1486.\n\n518.\n\nIt can be fairly asked why an international tribunal which derives its jurisdiction from an international treaty specifically concerned with the reciprocal promotion and protection of investment ought not to be concerned with the formalities of the law of the particular State pursuant to which a company has been incorporated when considering the ownership and governance of that company. Title to the shares of course specifies the precise extent of the shareholder\u2019s ownership in the company, establishes each shareholder\u2019s right to participate in the making of decisions which can be made by the shareholders alone, and is the means by which shareholders are identified for the purposes of convening meetings.\n\n519.\n\nThus, since the Claimant is a creature of Bahamian law, the Tribunal must look to the operation of that law. The point was made by the International Court of Justice in the *Barcelona Traction* case, where it observed:\n\nIn this field international law is called upon to recognize institutions of municipal law that have an important and extensive role in the international field. This does not necessarily imply drawing any analogy between its own institutions and those of municipal law, nor does it amount to making rules of international law depended upon categories of municipal law. All it means is that international law has had to recognize the corporate entity as an institution created by States in a domain essentially within their domestic jurisdiction. This in turn requires that, whenever legal issues arise concerning the rights of States with regard to the treatment of companies and shareholders, as to which rights international law has not established its own rules, it has to refer to the relevant rules of municipal law.824\n\nCase Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 3, paragraph 38 *(\u2018Barcelona Traction\").*\n\n520.\n\nBoth general international law and the applicable bilateral Treaty lack the specificity and particularity of municipal law (e.g. French law, Ecuadorian law, or Bahamian law) in terms of the ordering of corporate relationships and neither purports to regulate such spheres of corporate activity in detail.\n\n521.\n\nAs a matter of Bahamian law, the Perrodo heirs did not own the PIL shares as of the date of consent. Ought this not to disentitle them from claiming indirect control over PEL? Should the Tribunal not accord significant weight to this legal fact?\n\n522.\n\nGiven the absence of detailed general or conventional rules of international law governing the organisation, operation, management and control of an enterprise, a tribunal should in principle be guided by the more detailed prescriptions of the applicable municipal law.825 But at the same time, international law does not tend to permit formalities to triumph over fundamental realities.826 By way of example, in the field of diplomatic protection (which may, depending upon the issue, be relevant to the interpretation of a BIT), when claims commissions and arbitral tribunals have determined whether it is a person who holds the legal interest as opposed to a person who holds the beneficial interest in shares that is entitled to seek diplomatic protection, they have consistently found that it is the beneficial interest which is deserving of protection.827\n\n*Barcelona Traction,* paragraph 38.\n\nSee *Banro American Resources, Inc and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aurif\u00e8re du Kivu et du Maniema S.A.R.L. v.

Such scholarship, in the absence of a system of precedent, may be relied on by future tribunals and could contribute to the reshaping of the international law landscape even as the contours of the landscape are being drawn. The \u2018flexible approach\u2019 to piercing and to indirect\u2019 has by no means been consigned to the dustbin of international law.\" See also, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Dissenting Opinion of Professor Brigitte Stem (5 October 2012), paragraph 148: \"As far as the position of international law towards beneficial owners, in cases where the legal title and the beneficial ownership are split, is concerned, it is quite uncontroversial, after a thorough review of the existing doctrine and case-law, that international law grants relief to the owner of the economic interest.\"\n\nDavid J. Bederman, *Beneficial Ownership of International Claims* (1989) Int\u2019l & Comp. Law Quarterly, Vol. 38(4) 935 at 936 (\"The notion that the beneficial (and not the nominal) owner of property is the real party-in-interest before an international court may be justly considered a general principle of international law.\") and 945; M. Whiteman, *Digest of International Law* (1967), Vol. 8, pp 1261-1262.\n\n523.\n\nThe diplomatic protection cases are not directly on point because where claims commissions and tribunals have recognised the owners of beneficial interests, it has been in the context of determining whether such beneficial owners were proper claimants even though they lacked legal title to the assets in respect of which they were making a claim.828 The present case is different in that the beneficial owners of PIL at the material time are *not* claimants, but are rather adducing evidence of their legal interests under French law and their beneficial interests under Bahamian law in order to demonstrate that the Bahamian company that they ultimately control is a proper claimant under the France-Ecuador Treaty.\n\n*American Security and Trust Company Claim,* (1958-11 (26)) International Law Reports (London: Butterworths, 1963) at p 322 (US Foreign Claims Settlement Commission): \"ft is clear that the national character of the claim must be tested by the nationality of the individuals holding a beneficial interest therein rather than by nationality of the nominal or record holder of the claim. Precedents for the foregoing well-settled proposition are so numerous that it is not deemed necessary to document it with a long list of authorities...\"; *Howard Needles Tammen & Bergendoff v. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran* (Case No. 68), Iran-U.S. C.T.R. Vol. 11 (Cambridge: Grotius Publications, 1988) 302 at pp 312-313. Note that an additional distinguishing factor in this jurisprudence is the term used in its constitutive document, usually a settlement agreement, with respect to standing. The term commonly used is \"interest\", whether \"directly or indirectly, an interest\" (Iran-US Claims Tribunal) or \"substantial and bona fide interest\" (American-Mexican Claims Commission).\n\n524.\n\nA similar tension between the choices of proceeding on formalities or the fundamental economic facts is evident in ICSID jurisprudence on the scope of the bare use of the word \"controlled\" when determining the standing of a juridical person.829 In *Aguas del Tunari, S.A.* v. *Republic of Bolivia,* the tribunal considered the definition of the phrase \"controlled directly or indirectly.\" The issue before it did not centre on the significance of \"directly or indirectly\", but whether the term \"controlled\" referred to formal legal ownership or extended to actual exercise of control.830 The majority of the tribunal concluded that the \"ordinary meaning of \u2018control\u2019 would seemingly encompass both actual exercise of powers or direction and the rights arising from the ownership of shares.\"831 It added that, as for the legal definition, it \"also encompasses both the actual exercise of control and the right to control\".832 In his dissent, Mr. Jos\u00e9-Luis Alberro-Semerena suggested that since the word \"controlled\" was a past participle, encompassing the effect of an action rather than just the capacity to perform said action, the standing of a juridical person was established with evidence that it has received the effect of actions of the controlling entity.833 In his view it was \"incorrect to equate \u2018controlled\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019\" and \"[o]ne should be \u2018aware of the general principle of interpretation whereby a text ought to be interpreted in the manner that gives it effect - *ut magis valeat quampereat\"834*\n\n*Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, (21 October 2005), paragraph 264 *(\"Aguas del Tunari\"/,* see also, Dissenting Declaration of Jos\u00e9 Luis Alberro-Semerena, paragraphs 24-26 *(/Dissent of Alberro-Semerena\").*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Aguas del Tunari,* paragraph 227.\n\n*Aguas del Tunari,* paragraph 231. The Respondent at the hearing relies on the majority decision, stating \"the test for \"control\" presupposes an ownership interest\" (Transcript, Day 1, p 239 (Mr. Gal)). The Tribunal accepts that the majority in *Aguas del Tunari* emphasised the significance of ownership interest, but it did not exclude the relevance of evidence of actual exercise of control (see paragraphs 227 to 231 of *Aguas del Tunari).*\n\n*Dissent of Alberro-Semerena,* paragraph 26.\n\n*Dissent of Alberro-Semerena,* paragraph 32 [footnote omitted].\n\n525.\n\nThe tribunal members in *Aguas del Tunari* stood in agreement in one significant respect; that is, the necessity of considering more than the formal capacity to control the juridical entity. They diverged on whether this, in and of itself, can establish standing.\n\n526.\n\nIn the exceptional circumstances of this case, where *except* for legal title under Bahamian law, French nationals manifested every indicia of control over the shares of PIL - including legal ownership under the *lex situs* of the estate - the Tribunal is of the view that it cannot take a formalistic approach to the question of control. In this regard, the decision of the NAFTA Tribunal in *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v United Mexican States* warrants note. That tribunal found that Article 1117 of the NAFTA which requires that the investor bringing a claim on behalf of an enterprise demonstrate that it \"own[s] *or* control[s]\" the enterprise, could be satisfied by a showing of *de facto* control:\n\n\"The Tribunal does not follow Mexico\u2019s proposition that Article 1117 of the NAFTA requires a showing of legal control. The term \"control\" is not defined in the NAFTA. Interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning, control can be exercised in various manners. *Therefore, a showing of effective or \"de facto\" control is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, sufficient for the purposes of Article 1117 of the NAFTA. In the absence of legal control however, the Tribunal is of the opinion that de facto control must be established beyond any reasonable doubt.*\n\nDespite Thunderbird having less than 50% ownership of the Minority EDM Entities, the Tribunal has found sufficient evidence on the record establishing an unquestionable pattem of de facto control exercised by Thunderbird over the EDM entities. Thunderbird had the ability to exercise a significant influence on the decision-making of EDM and was, through its actions, officers, resources, and expertise, the consistent driving force behind EDM\u2019s business endeavour in Mexico.\"835 [Emphasis added]\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v United Mexican States,* UNCITRAL, Award (26 January 2006), paragraphs 106-107.\n\n527.\n\nIn light of the above, it is significant that the evidence is that as of 17 October 2007, the French nationals had legal ownership of the shares under French law, a fact recognised by Bahamian law, and they have established that at that date they had *de facto* control of PIL and through it the Bahamian subsidiaries.\n\n528.\n\nHaving regard to the fact that the text of the applicable provision of the Treaty refers simply to \"controlled\", the Tribunal is persuaded by the fact that the formal transfer of the shares of the late Mr. Hubert Perrodo to his heirs was an administrative or ministerial act. It is true that it occurred after the consent to ICSID arbitration was given, but it is also true that it could have occurred at any time after the heirs became the owners of the estate under French law, and that occurred at the time of death, namely, 29 December 2006, over 10 months prior to the giving of consent.\n\n529.\n\nMoreover, the evidence of French control is so substantial, so compelling and un-contradicted that it is the Tribunal's view that in the circumstances of this case, it is most consonant with the approach taken by international law to give weight to the fact of Bahamian law\u2019s recognition that the heirs owned the shares as a matter of French law and as a result they had beneficial ownership of the shares as a matter of Bahamian law prior to their formal re-registration in the names.836\n\nIn some of the commentaries and cases there has been some discussion of the desirability of avoiding undue formalism when it comes to establishing a claimant's standing to bring a claim. For example, in *Banro American Resources, Inc and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aurif\u00e8re du Kivu et du Maniema SA.R.L. v. Democratic Republic of the Congo,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/7, Award (1 September 2000), at paragraph 11, the tribunal stated: \"These few examples demonstrate that in general, ICSID tribunals do not accept the view that their competence is limited by formalities, and rather they rule on their competence based on a review of the circumstances surrounding the case, and, in particular, the actual relationships among the companies involved. This jurisprudence reveals the willingness of ICSID tribunals to refrain from making decisions on their competence based on formal appearances, and to base their decisions on a realistic assessment of the situation before them.\" The examples to which the *Banro* tribunal referred were cases where the claimant, as the party requesting arbitration, was not the same entity as the parties consenting to arbitration, and it was suggested by the tribunal that in such cases tribunals are willing to consider the nationalities of the consenting party and the claimant when making their determinations on jurisdiction. *Banro* has been discussed and distinguished from the case before the tribunal in the majority decision in *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction (29 April 2004) at paragraph 58, and discussed in the dissenting opinion of Professor Prosper Weil in the same case (see his dissenting opinion in paragraphs 25-26), and by the dissenting opinion of Horacio Grigera Na\u00f3n in *Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award on Jurisdiction (15 December 2010), paragraphs 20-21.\n\n530.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s objection to the Claimant\u2019s standing to bring the claim under the Treaty.\n\n**VIII. CLAIMS OF BREACH OF TREATY**\n------------------------------------\n\n531.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by identifying the law applicable to the claims of breach of Treaty, before turning to consider the parties\u2019 submissions and its findings on liability.\n\n**A. Law applicable to the claims relating to the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n532.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, unlike the Participation Contracts, which specify Ecuadorian law as the applicable law, the Treaty does not contain an express applicable law clause. Accordingly, the Tribunal must apply Article 42(1), second sentence, of the ICSID Convention, which provides as follows:\n\nIn the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n533.\n\nThis requires the Tribunal to apply Ecuadorian law and international law. It is well-established that the Treaty itself, as conventional law, falls within the phrase \"such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" The Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention noted in this regard that the term \u2018international law\u2019 as used in Article 42(1), second sentence, \"should be understood in the sense given to it by Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, allowance being made for the fact that Article 38 was designed to apply to interstate disputes.\" A bilateral investment treaty falls within Article 38\u2019s description of international law.837\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention, paragraph 40.\n\n534.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the applicable law for the purposes of this claim is Ecuadorian law (as already considered by the Tribunal) and the Treaty. In the event that there is a conflict between the two, on the basis of well-established principle recognised in international judicial and arbitral case law as well as in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and Article 3 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, international law prevails.838\n\nAs noted by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Case of the Greek-Bulgarian Communities: \"...* it is a generally accepted principle of international law that in the relations between Powers who are contracting Parties to a treaty the provisions of municipal law cannot prevail over those of the treaty.\" PCIJ Series B, No. 17, p 32. It follows from that principle, as recognised the *Case of the Treatment of Polish Nationals in Danzig,* that a State \"cannot adduce against another State its own Constitution with a view to evading obligations incumbent upon it under international law or treaties in force.\" PCIJ Series A/B. No. 44, p. 24. See also, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 27, Internal law and observance of treaties: \"A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.\" Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, entitled, \"Characterisation of an act of a State as internationally wrongful,\" states: \"The characterisation of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterisation is not affected by the characterisation of the same act as lawful by internal law.\" Both Article 27 and Article 3 have been applied consistently by ICSID and other investment treaty arbitral tribunals.\n\n**B. Fair and Equitable Treatment under Article 4 of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Treaty**\n------------------\n\n535.\n\nArticle 4 of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall undertake to accord just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law, to the investments of nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party and to ensure that the exercise of the right so granted is not impeded either *de jure* or *de facto.*\n\nIn particular, but not exclusively, the following shall be considered as *de jure* or *de facto* impediments to just and equitable treatment: any restrictions on the purchase or transportation of raw materials and secondary materials, energy and fuel, and means of production and operation of all kinds, any impediment to the sale or transportation of goods within the country and abroad, and any other measures having similar effect.\n\nInvestments made by nationals or companies of one Contracting Party shall be fully and completely protected and safeguarded by the other Contracting Party.\n\nNeither Contracting Party shall in any way impede the management, preservation, use, enjoyment or transfer of the investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.839\n\nExhibit CE-7, Treaty, PER 00520.\n\n**(2) The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n*a. The Claimant \u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n536.\n\nPerenco submitted that Law 42, both at 50% and at 99%, as well as other measures Ecuador took in relation thereto amounted to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation in Article 4.840\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 34.\n\n537.\n\nAccording to Perenco, the objective of the fair and equitable treatment standard is to:\n\n\"...provide to international investments treatment that that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment, as long as these expectations are reasonable and legitimate and have been relied upon by the investor to make the investment.\"841\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 155, quoting from *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008) (CA-5), paragraph 602. The *Biwater* tribunal articulated this in connection with its explanation of the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard; it identified as components of the standard the \"protection of legitimate expectations,\" the principle that \"contracting parties must act in good faith\" and that the \"conduct of the State must be transparent, consistent and non-discriminatory.\"\n\n538.\n\nPerenco argued that its basic expectations were largely set forth in the Participation Contracts.842 It had a legitimate expectation that Ecuador, by entering into the Participation Contracts, agreed to tie the parties\u2019 participation exclusively to the volume of production generated by the contractor, thereby isolating it from oil price fluctuations, and that it would not upset the underlying commercial bargain arrived at by taking action which would result in drastic changes to participation percentages in response to price fluctuations in the global market.843 Ecuador undermined this expectation by enacting and enforcing Law 42.844 This was compounded by the raising of the percentage of revenues demanded by Law 42 to 99% on 4 October 2007,845 the purpose of which was to \"force companies like Perenco to \u2018open the profit box\u2019 - essentially to take income that Perenco had borne all risk and expense to earn and that by the originally agreed allocation formulae belonged to Perenco.\"846\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 156: \"They included the expectation that the fundamental economic deal was settled based on the participation sharing agreed in the Contracts, that this was a stable basis for investing, and that should disputes arise they would be settled by an orderly and peaceable process of international arbitration rather than through local Ecuadorian procedures.\" In its Reply, Perenco clarified the relationship between the terms of the Participation Contracts and its legitimate expectations; the Participation Contracts \"did not delimit the investor expectations that Ecuador created\", though they \"certainly reflected and reinforced these expectations.\" (Reply, paragraph 283).\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 34; Revised Memorial, paragraphs 156-159, 169. At paragraph 282 of the Reply, Perenco summarised its claim against Ecuador in the following terms: \"Ecuador thus deliberately created an environment in which a contractor could expect that it would operate under a production sharing model where the economic benefit was allocated between the contractor and the State based on an agreed percentage of production, that the contractor would not be unilaterally and coercively forced to abandon this model for a less profitable services contract, and that any disputes over such economic matters would be peaceably resolved through binding international arbitration.\"\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 167; Reply, paragraph 287. In this regard, Perenco, at paragraph 287 of its Reply, characterised Ecuador\u2019s conduct as having \"concede[d] that the motive for these contractual amendments was to achieve the State\u2019s goal of imposing services contracts in place of participation contracts, thus undoing what the prior governments had done.\"\n\nPursuant to the Second Implementing Regulation: Exhibit CE-64, Decree No. 662, Implementing Law 42. For a description of events leading up to the enactment of Executive Decree No. 662, see above at paragraphs [100] to [109],\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 167.\n\n539.\n\nPerenco submitted that it also held a reasonable expectation that the Participation Contracts would not be amended given their clause 15.2 which required the prior agreement of the parties for any amendments, this reinforced by statements of Ecuadorian Government officials in 2005.847 It relied on this understanding of the underlying commercial bargain when it chose to put enormous capital at risk in Ecuador,848 combined with the serious steps Ecuador had taken to encourage foreign investment in Ecuador.849 In this way, Perenco argued it was justified in its \"eminently reasonable expectation\" that Ecuador \"would not take away the reward of the investment once it had successfully managed the risk of that investment.\"850 In this connection, Perenco contended that when it sought in good faith to negotiate with Ecuador, Ecuador responded inflexibly and unpredictably, ignoring its obligation to negotiate a correction factor and to abide by the Decision on Provisional Measures.851\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 160-161. Clause 15.2 may be reviewed at PER 04703 of Exhibit CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, and at PER 04829 of Exhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 159.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 162. Perenco claimed that Ecuador in the years preceding its decision to invest actively courted foreign investment \"through a wide range of official actions,\" including though not limited to \"liberalization of laws concerning the oil industry, such as the amendment to the [Hydrocarbons Law] that permitted participation contracts\" and \"active Government support and encouragement for large scale investment required to construct the OCP pipeline\": see Revised Memorial, paragraph 162.\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 34.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 169.\n\n540.\n\nPerenco further submitted that it had a legitimate expectation that disputes regarding the investment would be \"resolved peaceably through an international arbitration process at ICSID.\"852 This expectation was buttressed by the Participation Contracts themselves, which expressly called for certain disputes to be resolved by ICSID arbitration.853 Perenco maintained that the dispute resolution procedure was an important aspect of its agreement with Ecuador (set out in the Participation Contracts), on which it specifically relied.854 In this connection, Perenco challenged Ecuador\u2019s \"defiance\" of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures as unfair and inequitable.855\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 163.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 164-165.\n\nReply, paragraphs 297-300.\n\n541.\n\nPerenco claimed that Ecuador\u2019s actions in direct contravention of Perenco\u2019s legitimate expectations effectively removed a substantial portion of revenue to which Perenco was entitled and rendered its investment in Blocks 7 and 21 commercially unviable.856 As such, it requested that the Tribunal issue an award which declares, amongst other things, that Ecuador failed to accord fair and equitable treatment to its investments in the Participation Contracts in breach of its obligations under Article 4 of the Treaty and should be ordered to pay monetary damages.\n\nAmended Request, paragraph 34.\n\n542.\n\nIn addition, Perenco submitted that Ecuador breached Article 4 of the Treaty by interfering with the management, use, enjoyment and transfer of its investment in Blocks 7 and 21. That the right \"to manage, use and enjoy its investments entailed that it would be permitted, within the contractual parameters, to operate the Blocks, to seek and produce oil, to further invest in additional wells and infrastructure, to direct the activities of employees, and to earn and benefit from profits determined according to the agreed participation sharing formulae.\"857\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 176; Reply, paragraph 328.\n\n543.\n\nHowever, as a result of Law 42, the Implementing Regulations and Ecuador\u2019s actions in relation thereto, Perenco contended that Ecuador \"progressively and increasingly denied Perenco the various attributes of management, use and enjoyment of its investments\":\n\n*First,* by enacting and enforcing Law 42, Ecuador deprived Perenco of substantial profits and blunted further investment in additional wells. *Second,* by lodging *coactivas* and commencing seizures Ecuador deprived Perenco of all its production, cargoes and revenue. *Third,* by seizing the Blocks themselves and terminating the Contracts Ecuador prevented Perenco from any management, use and enjoyment of the investments whatsoever.858\n\n*Ibid.* [Italics in original.].\n\n*b. The Respondent \u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nEcuador for its part challenged whether the \"legitimate expectation\" as articulated by Perenco was consistent with the terms of the Contracts:\n\nWhere, as in the present case, it is said that the investment is a set of contractual rights conferred by the State, an investor\u2019s purported *\u2018expectation\u2019* within the meaning of Article 4 of the Treaty will neither be reasonable nor capable of reasonable reliance where it is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract between the investor and the State.859\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 465 [Italics in original.]. At paragraphs 272-276 of its Reply, Perenco submitted in this regard that Ecuador improperly contends that its Treaty obligation of fair and equitable treatment is strictly bounded by the terms of the Participation Contracts.\n\n545.\n\nEcuador submitted that Perenco has failed to prove that Law 42 modified the economic bargain upon which the terms of the Contracts were premised.860 It argued Law 42 could not modify the Contracts because on a strict reading of its terms it did not affect the participation in volume of oil that Perenco was entitled to receive.861 The Participation Contracts did not guarantee Perenco a right to a given revenue stream, let alone substantial profits.862 Thus, Perenco faced an uphill battle in proving that Law 42 affected the economy of the Participation Contracts and further that a correction factor to the Consortium\u2019s participation in oil should have been negotiated between the parties.863\n\nIn this regard, Ecuador relies on the evidence of its expert, Dr. Aguilar. Dr. Aguilar at paragraphs 51-53 of his 3rd Expert Report states that Law 42 could not have modified the Participation Contracts because they established a participation in crude oil and Law 42 did not change the percentages of participation in oil, only \"the benefit that can be obtained from its sale\", and further, that Law 42 was an administrative act which modified the legal framework governing the contracts and was not \"an administrative act intended to alter one or more specific contracts.\" Dr. Aguilar in his 4th Expert Report reiterates this distinction between the change in the legal framework applicable to the Participation Contracts and a modification in its terms, while acknowledging that it is apparent that the change in the legal framework had \"an impact on the contractual relationship\": paragraphs 82-84.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 24, 469.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 495.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 24.\n\n546.\n\nEcuador suggested that Perenco\u2019s submission was in essence an argument that an investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time it made its investment will remain unchanged.864 It stressed that this was not just contrary to settled jurisprudence on this issue, but stood in stark contrast to the decision of the contracting parties not to include a stabilisation clause in their contracts.865\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 471, citing *Saluka Investments BV (Netherlands) v. Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award (17 March 2006), paragraph 305 (CA-25). Perenco in its Reply, at paragraph 288, rejects this characterisation of its position, stating \"[i]t is not Perenco\u2019s position that a State\u2019s laws cannot change over time, or that the circumstances prevailing at the time of the investment would \u2018remain totally unchanged\u2019 (citation omitted). However, this does not in and of itself mean that *any* subsequent regulation is compliant with a State\u2019s international obligations, particularly if the State created expectations as to the structure that would govern an investment.\" [Emphasis in original.]\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 473-475. Ecuador relies on statements of the tribunal in *Sergei Paushok, CSJC Golden East Company, CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v. The Government of Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability (28 April 2011) (EL-103) which suggests that a tax stabilisation or correction clause is a significant factor when determining whether an investor legitimately held an expectation that it would not be exposed to significant tax modifications in the future (paragraph 302 of the Award).\n\n547.\n\nIn this connection, Ecuador submitted that, at best, the \"only expectation which Perenco could reasonably have entertained given the terms of its Participation Contracts with Ecuador was that the State would negotiate a correction factor to the participation percentages\" in the event of a tax modification which disrupted the economy of the contracts.866 However, in this respect Perenco has failed to discharge its burden of proving that the parties were obliged to negotiate a correction factor as a result of Law 42, and that the failure to negotiate (if it was obliged to do so) was due to the fault of Ecuador.867 Ecuador argued that it was incumbent upon Perenco to provide the necessary financial impact data to Petroecuador in order for the adjustment process to be initiated.868\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 477.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 479-484.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 478-488.\n\n548.\n\nRegarding Perenco\u2019s claim that Ecuador breached Article 4 by interfering with Perenco\u2019s use and enjoyment of its investment, Ecuador submitted that the Participation Contracts did not preclude the State from enacting and enforcing Law 42 because they did not guarantee Perenco a right to a given revenue stream.869 Moreover, Law 42 did not \u2018blunt\u2019 further investment as evidenced by the position adopted by Perenco during the provisional measures stage of this arbitration that it could feasibly continue to operate and commit to necessary expenditure in Ecuador if it paid the dues owed to Ecuador into an escrow account.870\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 495.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 496: \"...Those dues, amounting to approximately US$ 327 million were precisely the sums that Perenco offered, and the Arbitral Tribunal recommended at the preliminary measures stage, should be paid into escrow by Perenco. It was Perenco\u2019s case that it could perfectly well continue to operate, and make the necessary investments, if it paid those dues into escrow. In those circumstances, Perenco cannot reasonably contend that the manner in which Law 42 was applied in the instant case, including the lodging of *coactivas* and the system of seizures of oil, would have left it in any different position that which *it* proposed and the *Arbitral Tribunal* recommended.\" [Emphasis in original.]\n\n549.\n\nEcuador further submitted that Perenco could not contend that the events subsequent to the enactment of Law 42 and the termination of the Contracts interfered with the use and enjoyment of its investment since the State was acting pursuant to a lawfully enacted law, and was obliged to respond to Perenco\u2019s own illegal conduct.871\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 495-498. In this regard, Ecuador contends that the temporary running of the Blocks and the action seeking the termination of the Participation Contracts were expressly provided for in the Contracts and Ecuadorian law as legitimate responses to Perenco\u2019s alleged breach of contract: Counter-Memorial, paragraph 497.\n\n550.\n\nFurthermore, Ecuador submitted that Perenco\u2019s claims taken at its highest estimation is that Law 42 prevented its ability to act \"within the contractual parameters\" of the Participation Contracts, and that this cannot in and of itself constitute a breach of the Article 4 treaty standard because Article 4 requires Perenco to further demonstrate that \"any impediment to its ability to exercise its contractual rights by the State was *\u2018obviously arbitrary\u2019* or involved some *\u2018tortuous element\u2019* \"872 Perenco had failed to substantiate this in its submissions with respect to Article 4.873\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 500 [Emphasis in original.].\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 500-502.\n\n**(3) The Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n-------------------------------\n\n551.\n\nAlthough the unofficial English translation of the Treaty published by the United Nations Treaty Series uses the phrase *\"just* and equitable treatment,\" both disputing Parties have treated the phrase as if it is \"fair and equitable treatment\" and rightly so.\n\n552.\n\nAs set out above, the Claimant\u2019s submissions focus on two parts of Article 4: (i) what might be called a general fair and equitable treatment argument advanced under Article 4, first paragraph, based upon Perenco\u2019s legitimate expectations; and (ii) a somewhat different argument advanced under Article 4, fourth paragraph, based on the claim that by enacting Law 42 at 50% and by raising it to 99%, the Respondent impeded the management, preservation, use, enjoyment or transfer of Perenco\u2019s investments.\n\n553.\n\nArticle 4 sets out the general obligation to \"accord [fair] and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law\" which is buttressed by the duty to ensure that the exercise of the rights so granted is not impeded (either *de jure* or *de facto).* Examples of such impediments are then set out in a non-exhaustive form in the second paragraph (\"... [i]n particular, but not exclusively, the following shall be considered as *de jure* or *de facto* impediments to [fair] and equitable treatment...\"). The second paragraph, which has not been emphasised by the Claimant, is evidently designed to elaborate upon the last part of the first paragraph.874\n\nThe third paragraph, which also has not been invoked by the Claimant, deals with the issue of full protection and security, and need not be addressed.\n\n554.\n\nThe fourth paragraph, which has been invoked by the Claimant, also uses the word \"impede.\" Given the use of this verb, it might also be thought to be, like the second paragraph, an elaboration of the kind of conduct which could constitute a *de jure* or *de facto* impediment. However, it can also be read as a separate obligation of a somewhat broader nature than the fair and equitable treatment obligations set forth in the first paragraph. This is the basis on which the Claimant has argued the case.875 The Tribunal will proceed on the basis that it is a separate obligation.\n\nPerenco\u2019s rebuttal, at paragraphs 329-336 of the Reply, warrants note. Perenco stated that Ecuador conflates its rebuttal to the claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment with that of breach of the obligation not to impede or impair the investor\u2019s right to manage, use and enjoy; that there was in Ecuador\u2019s view no breach of the terms of the Participation Contracts. Perenco submitted that the latter obligation is distinct from the obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment, and the observance of contractual obligations (which Perenco disputes occurred in its case in any event) is not a sufficient answer.\n\n555.\n\nThe Tribunal will first deal with the general fair and equitable treatment claim and then consider the impediment claim.\n\n*a. The general allegation of breach of fair and equitable treatment and the Claimant \u2019s legitimate expectations*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n556.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s Article 4 claim has a number of separate, but interrelated strands. For the purposes of analysis, the Tribunal will differentiate between claimed expectations pertaining to the resolution of disputes arising under the Participation Contracts - i.e. the Claimant\u2019s entitlement to ICSID arbitration under the two Contracts and the Respondent\u2019s conduct in relation thereto - and its expectations of a more substantive nature - i.e. the impact on Perenco\u2019s expectations of the enactment of Law 42, the application of Decree 662, and various other measures taken by Ecuador in relation to Perenco\u2019s rights under the Participation Contracts. The Tribunal finds it convenient to deal with these expectations separately.\n\n557.\n\nWith respect to the general approach to be taken to the meaning of the fair and equitable treatment standard, Article 4 of the Treaty requires a Contracting Party to accord \"[fair] and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law\".876 This particular formulation of the standard is not tethered to the international minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.877\n\nExhibit CE-7, Treaty, Article 4, paragraph 1 (PER 00520).\n\nAs noted by the tribunal in *AWG Group Ltd. v. Argentine Republic,* UNCITRAL, Decision on Liability (30 July 2010), which examined a similar treaty between Argentina and France (at paragraph 184): \"With respect to the Argentina-France BIT, it is to be noted that the text of the treaty refers simply to \u2018the principles of international law,\u2019 not to \u2018the minimum standard of customary international law.\u2019 The formulation \u2018minimum standard under customary international law\u2019 or simply \u2018minimum international standard\u2019 is so well known and so well-established in international law that one can assume that if France and Argentina had intended to limit the content of fair and equitable treatment to the international minimum standards they would have used that formulation specifically. In fact, they did not.\"\n\n558.\n\nThat said, as has been found by many other investment treaty tribunals presented with the task of ascertaining the standard\u2019s meaning - even where the applicable treaty contains no reference to customary international law - there is much to be said for the general approach stated by the tribunal in *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States,* which characterised conduct attributable to the State and injurious to the investor as violating the standard when it is:\n\n...arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.878\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/3, Award (30 April 2004), paragraph 98. This passage has been cited with approval by many non-NAFTA tribunals such as *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008), at paragraph 597: \"This threshold is a high one. As stated by the tribunal in *Waste Management v. Mexico (No. 2)...\"* (The tribunal then cited paragraph 98 of the *Waste Management II* award). In *Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6, Award (16 January 2013), at paragraph 227, the tribunal commented: \"Tribunals in other cases have pointed to be high threshold in this regard. In *Waste Management,* the award referred to \u2018 \u2018a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with the manifest failure of natural justice...\u2019 The Tribunal considers that to be the correct approach.\" See also *Deutsche Bank AG v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/2, Award (31 October 2012), at paragraph 420: \"In this respect, the Tribunal notes that the standard has been rightly - although not exhaustively - defined in the *Waste Management II* case\" (which the tribunal then proceeded to set out).\n\n559.\n\nThe inclusion of such words as \"arbitrary,\" the use of the adjectival modifiers \"grossly\" in relation to \"unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic,\" and \"manifest\" in relation to a failure of natural justice and \"complete\" in relation to a lack of transparency and candour implies a search for the \u2018something more\u2019 that distinguishes an act in violation of international law from the perceived unfairness occasioned by many governmental actions that do not rise to a breach of international law. The challenge is to discern between the two.\n\n560.\n\nMany cases hold that a central aspect of the analysis of an alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard is the investor\u2019s reasonable expectations as to the future treatment of its investment by the host State.879 This requires the Tribunal to make an objective determination of such expectations having regard to all relevant circumstances.880 The expectations are not those exclusively of the investor and an undue reliance upon a claimant\u2019s subjective expectations expressed in the context of adversarial proceedings years after the investment\u2019s making, can result in a skewed view of what it could reasonably have expected when it made the investment. In *Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic* the tribunal observed, after having reviewed certain statements of prior tribunals, that if taken too literally, they would impose \"obligations which would be inappropriate and unrealistic\" on the host State.881 The search is for a balanced approach between the investor\u2019s reasonable expectations and the exercise of the host State\u2019s regulatory and other powers.\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award (8 October 2009), paragraph 216; *El Paso Energy International Company v.

See also *White Industries Australia Limited v. India,* UNCITRAL, Final Award (30 November 2011), paragraphs 10.3.5-10.3.6.\n\n561.\n\nIn cases where a contract exists between the investor and the host State, the terms of the contract and the State\u2019s legislation in relation thereto, assume particular significance in the analysis. As has already been seen, the relevant administrative contracts exist not only as Taw between the parties\u2019 in Ecuador, but also within a broader framework of law, including the Civil Code, the Hydrocarbons Law, and the Constitution.\n\n562.\n\nWhere a State has duly considered a legislative/regulatory policy, as was the case in 1994 when Ecuador resolved that it was in the nation\u2019s interest to move from service to participation contracts, governmental decisions taken thereafter must, during the lifetime of such contractual arrangements maintain fidelity to that policy framework. This is not to say that the policy framework is frozen and cannot be changed because this is not so unless the State has expressly stabilised its law *vis-\u00e0-vis* its contractual counterparty.882 But even as in the instant case, where there is no full stability clause in its contracts, any changes to the policy framework must still be made mindful of the State\u2019s contractual commitments.\n\nAs noted in *Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Liability (27 December 2010), paragraph 101: \"... Stabilisation clauses are clauses, which are inserted in State contracts concluded between foreign investors and host states with the intended effect of freezing a specific host State's legal framework at a certain date, such that the adoption of any changes in the legal regulatory framework of the investment concerned (even by law of general application and without any discriminatory intent by the host State) would be illegal.\"\n\n563.\n\nThe Participation Contracts were anchored in a legislative framework duly considered and enacted by the Nation\u2019s Congress.883 That framework and its rationale set out certain key features of the new contractual regime which were then reflected in the contracts subsequently concluded with oil companies.884 Consequently, any contractor could reasonably expect that the contracts\u2019 structure would not be altered by Petroecuador unilaterally or undone by subsequent State action external to the contract except in accordance with their terms and the State\u2019s law.\n\nExhibit CE-4, Law 44 Legislative Debates, PER 00481: \"Third objective of the reforms: Who is going to invest in these [six] exploration capitals? The private companies. In the last five years there has not been a single petroleum exploration contract signed in Ecuador. How do we make the investment in Ecuador more attractive? Through this new type of contract, the participation contract which is used in every country which produces oil.\"; see also, Exhibit CE-5, Law 44, PER 00487: \"That more investments are required for exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons...it is essential to introduce contractual systems into Ecuador\u2019s legislation that will make hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation competitive.\"\n\nSee above at paragraphs [57]-[59],\n\n564.\n\nThe dramatic rise in oil prices in the last decade should not be permitted to obscure this. Particularly after changes in government occur, States must seek to act consistently with, and governments cannot wilfully repudiate, long-term commercial relationships with foreign investors concluded by their predecessors.885 New governments must bear in mind why the State engaged in such relationships in the first place, because resource extraction and other capital-intensive investments with substantial \u2018up-front\u2019 costs generally require a medium to long-term period of operations in order to be able to generate a reasonable return on investment. Such investments must be able to withstand deviations in governmental policy that could undermine their contractual framework.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award (20 August 2007), paragraph 7.4.39.\n\ni. What expectations did Perenco have at the time of the making of its investment?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n565.\n\nThere is no record evidence that the Respondent made any specific representations or gave any specific assurances to Perenco that induced it to acquire Kerr McGee\u2019s interests in the two contracts.\n\n566.\n\nMr. Patrick Spink, who evaluated the Kerr McGee opportunity for Perenco, testified that the company \"took great comfort in the relatively clear terms of key aspects of the Participation Contracts\"886 and noted that \"Ecuador had also sent other signals that it welcomed foreign investment in the oil sector and intended to continue to support a business and legal environment conducive to such investment,\" referring in particular to the construction of the OCP pipeline.887 Mr. Spink testified further that his perception of Ecuador\u2019s commitment to the development of its oil industry in partnership with foreign investors was \"reinforced by the limited contact [he] had with Ecuadorian Government officials,\" noting that shortly after the signature of the Kerr McGee deal, he had a courtesy meeting with Ecuador\u2019s former Minister of Energy and Mines, Dr. Ter\u00e1n.888 In short, although Perenco took comfort from the terms of the contracts and the OCP project, Mr. Spink did not claim that he received express commitments from Ecuadorian officials *prior* to Perenco\u2019s making the investment.889\n\n1st Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraph 12. In his written testimony, Mr. Spink did not address whether Perenco understood the participation contracts to be in the nature of administrative contracts under Ecuadorian law in that they might differ from contracts otherwise governed by the Ecuadorian Commercial Code. For a discussion of their differences, see 3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 4-14.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraph 14.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 17.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Patrick Spink, paragraphs 9-16.\n\n567.\n\nThus, Perenco\u2019s expectations were, as the Claimant generally pleaded the case, basically founded upon the Participation Contracts which in turn reflected the provisions of Law 44.890\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 159-160; Exhibits CE-4, Law 44, PER 00481, CE-5, Law 44, and CE-303, Official Communication No. 93-225, Quito, 29 October 1993, pp 2- 4.\n\n568.\n\nWith respect to the expectations of Perenco\u2019s predecessor in interest, Oryx/Kerr McGee, the Tribunal recalls that Ecuador\u2019s move from service contracts to participation contracts was motivated by the nation\u2019s inability to adequately develop its petroleum resources.891 In such circumstances, an investor such as Oryx/Kerr McGee could reasonably expect at the time of the acquisition of its contractual rights that so long as it acted consistently with its legal and contractual obligations, it would be entitled to receive its share of petroleum pursuant to its contract, and that it would be free to dispose of that share with the expectation that, subject to the payment of all taxes and other levies, it would be entitled to make whatever profit remained after the costs of doing business.892 Given Article 10 of Law 44893 and Decree 14 1 7894, both of which were expressly incorporated into the Participation Contracts, and both of which stated that amendments \"required the prior agreement of the parties,\"895 the contractor could also reasonably expect that the contract would not be unilaterally amended by Petroecuador in a manner which was inconsistent with Ecuadorian law.\n\n*Ibid.',* Exhibit CE-13, Law 46 on Promotion and Guarantee of Investments, Official Registry 219 of 19 December 1997 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts), PER 0074.\n\nReply, paragraphs 284-285. Perenco argued in response it \"could not reasonably have expected that it would enjoy the upside from sales of oil at higher oil prices entirely free of any fiscal measure which took a percentage of this windfall revenues for the State\" (Counter-Memorial, paragraph 471). Perenco states first, that it could and \"in fact did\" expect that it would \"benefit from higher oil prices *in proportion to the contractually agreed participation formula\",* and then follows this by asserting that regardless of whether or not this was the case, it \"certainly had every right to expect that Ecuador would not *entirely* deprive it of the upside from sales at higher oil prices\" since that was a \"fundamental benefit\" of participation contracts: Reply, paragraph 285 [Emphasis in original.].\n\nWhich provided that \"[a]t the State\u2019s discretion, contracts for the exploration and use of hydrocarbons may be modified by an agreement of the contracting parties, and upon approval by the Special Bidding Committee (CEL).\" Exhibit CE-5, Law 44 Amending the Hydrocarbons Law, Official Registry No. 326 of 29 November 1993 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts), PER 0484, 89.\n\nWhich stated that the modification process could be commenced \"provided that the parties have reached mutual agreement over the proposed modification.\" Exhibit CE-6, Decree No. 1417, Regulation for the Application of the Hydrocarbons Law, Official Registry No. 364 of 21 January 1994 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts), PER 00503.\n\nSee clauses 15.2 of the Block 7 and 21 Participation Contracts which describes the circumstances in which the process of negotiating and introducing amendments to the contract should be initiated: Exhibits CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04703 and CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04829.\n\n569.\n\nConsistent with its prior determination that the Contracts were not stabilised as understood by by Ecuadorian law, the Tribunal sees force in Ecuador\u2019s argument that without a full stabilisation clause in the contracts, the contractor could not reasonably expect that the contracts would be completely immunised from future legislative or other measures.896 That said, the contractor could also reasonably expect that the taxation modification clauses could be employed in appropriate circumstances.897\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Ecuador included an example of a stability clause contained in a contract between the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Industrialization, and Fisheries and Samedan Oil Corporation: Counter-Memorial, paragraph 398, referring to Exhibit E-125.\n\nSee clauses 11.7 (Block 21) and 11.12 (Block 7) at Exhibits CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04699 and CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04823.\n\n570.\n\nThere is no suggestion that the two Contracts did not operate in accordance with their terms up to the date of the sale of Kerr McGee\u2019s interests to Perenco. Given Kerr McGee\u2019s experience, there was no reason why Perenco should not have held essentially the same expectations as its predecessor in interest.898 Perenco did not suggest that the Participation Contracts did not operate in accordance with their terms up until the first of the impugned measures, the enactment of Law 42 in April 2006 and the initial claim to 50% of the extraordinary revenues made by Executive Decree No. 1672, the law\u2019s implementing decree issued on 11 July 2006.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 26-35 for the Claimant\u2019s account of the circumstances surrounding its acquisition of interest in Blocks 7 and 21, and see Exhibit CE-15, Memorandum No. CE-015, Memorandum No. 269-CEF-99, from Petroecuador\u2019s Negotiation Commission for Block 7 to the President and Members of the Special Bidding Commission (CEL), 13 November 1999 (in Spanish with English translation of excerpts), PER 00781-00782. During the negotiation of the Block 7 Contract, it was proposed to Oryx that in light of the behavior of crude-oil prices in the weeks preceding, different prices should be stipulated to apply during the course of the contractual term; namely, \"US$ 17 through 2002; from 2003 to 2006, a price of US$ 16; and from 2007 to 2010, a price of US$ 15.\" This was not accepted by Oryx because, according to the memorandum prepared by Petroecuador\u2019s Negotiation Commission, \"this parameter was completely uncertain in terms of its behavior, to the point of it being at US$ 8 in May 1998, when the company accepted it at US$ 15 and historically the trend had demonstrated it to be below US$ 15.\" The memorandum further records that Oryx on the basis of the same reasoning rejecting an alternative proposal; that \"an average of US$ 17 per barrel be set, with the parties equitably sharing the surplus at 50% each.\"\n\nii. Dispute settlement expectations based on the Participation Contracts\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n571.\n\nPerenco emphasised that quite apart from its expectations as to how the Contracts would operate generally, it had other legitimate expectations, namely, that any disputes arising under the Participation Contracts would be resolved peaceably through arbitration. It noted in this regard:\n\nPerenco also had every reason to expect that disputes regarding the investment would be resolved peaceably through an international arbitration process at ICSID. As the Tribunal has already determined, after the Congress in 1986 had confirmed its ratification of the ICSID Convention, the Contracts themselves expressly called for economic disputes to be resolved by ICSID arbitration... Pursuant to Clause 22.1 of the Block 21 Contract, the parties even incorporated the ICSID Convention as part of the Contract\u2019s \u2018legal framework.\u2019899\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 163.\n\n572.\n\nThis agreement to resolve disputes through arbitration in Perenco\u2019s view \"certainly implied an agreement to honor decisions of an arbitral tribunal\" and Perenco noted that this expectation was made explicit as a contractual promise in clauses 22.2.2, by which both parties undertook to use the means set forth in the Contract \"to resolve doubts and disputes that may arise during its life, *and to observe and comply with the decisions of the competent consultants, arbitrators, judges or courts,* as the case may be, pursuant to the provisions of this Contract.\"900\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 164 [Emphasis in original.]: Exhibits CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04724 and CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04865.\n\n573.\n\nHaving set out its expectations based upon the contracts, including their arbitration provisions, Perenco then asserted that Ecuador undermined its expectations of the economic terms of the deal by enacting and enforcing Law 42.901 It also argued that the Respondent\u2019s initiation of the *coactiva* process to collect sums claimed to be due, which in turn led to the various requests and orders of the Tribunal in relation to the process of its considering and ultimately granting the provisional measures sought by Perenco, and Ecuador\u2019s subsequent disregard of the provisional measures recommendation amounted to an additional breach of fair and equitable treatment (as well as a breach of contract).902 But for this latter breach, it argued, Perenco would still be operating in Ecuador today and a large escrow balance would have accumulated.903\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 169 and 225.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 224-226; Reply, paragraphs 268 *et seq.*\n\n574.\n\nEcuador argued in response that in order to succeed on this argument Perenco would have to demonstrate that the notion of \"legitimate expectations\" on which it relied was well-founded and consistent with the terms of the Participation Contracts.904 Ecuador submitted that Perenco failed to do so because its argument presupposed that Ecuador was required contractually to abide by the *\"request* of 24 February 2009 and the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s *recommendation* of provisional measures.\"905 It contended that the Participation Contracts created an expectation that the parties would submit to ICSID arbitration specified disputes and abide by the final award.906 It could not support the expectation that Ecuador would be bound to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s recommendations of provisional measures.907\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 426.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 428 [Emphasis in original.]\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 448.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 449.\n\n575.\n\nAlternatively, Ecuador submitted that should the Tribunal find that such expectation is well-founded, Ecuador\u2019s actions in alleged breach could not be said to be causative of any loss to Perenco.908 In particular, it did not cause Perenco to abandon the Blocks.909 Ecuador\u2019s actions were declared as a consequence of Perenco\u2019s actions, and it demanded the payment of dues or seized their equivalent in crude that Perenco already agreed to set aside and represented could do so without requiring it to abandon the Blocks (by placing it in escrow).910\n\nCounter-Memorial, section6.3.2.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 453.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 455-457.\n\n576.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Perenco that the expectation of peaceable resolution of disputes pursuant to the Contracts\u2019 arbitration clauses was a reasonable and legitimate expectation of the private contractor (whether the original contractor or its successor in interest). It will deal with the Respondent\u2019s response to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures separately below, but for present purposes it will consider the general expectation of peaceable settlement of disputes and whether that expectation has been met.\n\n577.\n\nPerenco did not move to challenge Law 42 either under the Contracts or under the Treaty until after Ecuador began to apply Decree 662 to it. (Perenco consented to ICSID arbitration on 17 October 2007, some thirteen days after Decree 662 was issued. It filed its Request for Arbitration on 30 April 2008.911) Putting to one side for the moment the Respondent\u2019s decision not to comply with the Provisional Measures Decision, the arbitration has unfolded in accordance with the Contracts. Ecuador has participated fully herein, has exercised its right to make objections, and has contested the merits of the claims after the Decision on Jurisdiction.912 Indeed, it has filed a counterclaim against Perenco for alleged environmental damage.\n\nExhibit CE-264, letter from Perenco to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum.\n\nThe Tribunal for present purposes makes no evaluation of the reasonableness of mounting any of the objections for the purposes of an ultimate determination of the allocation of costs in this proceeding.\n\n578.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Perenco\u2019s claims that Ecuador has denied it fair and equitable treatment in relation to its procedural expectations of access to international dispute settlement *generally* have not been made out.\n\niii. Expectations with respect to the Decision on Provisional Measures\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nTurning to the narrower question of the Claimant\u2019s claimed expectation of Ecuador\u2019s compliance with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal has already found that as a matter of Ecuadorian law and clauses 22.2.2 of the Contracts,913 the Respondent agreed to comply not only with any award of a tribunal, but also with a broader category of \"decisions\". Thus, the Claimant justifiably had a reasonable expectation that if a dispute arose between the parties, the Respondent would comply with all decisions of a tribunal constituted pursuant to the Contracts. Having found that there was a breach of contract for Ecuador\u2019s failure to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures, as set out above at paragraphs 413 to 417, the Tribunal considers it is therefore not necessary to deal with arguments regarding the effect of the Decision on Provisional Measures under Article 4 of the Treaty.\n\nExhibits CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04724 and CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04865.\n\niv. Substantive expectations relating to the Contracts\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n580.\n\nIn advancing its allegation of breach, the Claimant tended to conflate a series of measures which were taken at different times over a course of some four years. In its pleadings, the Claimant tended to lump together: (i) Law 42 at 50%; (ii) the promulgation and application of Decree 662; (iii) the Correa administration\u2019s demands for the migration of participation contracts to a service contract model; (iv) the subsequent demand for a faster migration to service contracts than that initially sought; (v) the demands for payment of levies claimed to have been owed under Law 42; (vi) the launching of *coactivas-,* (vii) the decision to enforce the *coactivas* notwithstanding the Tribunal\u2019s recommendation that it not do so during the pendency of the arbitration; and (viii) the breakdown in negotiations which led to the Consortium\u2019s decision to suspend operations, which in turn led to the initiation of the proceeding resulting in the declaration of *caducidad,914*\n\nFor example, following a proposed settlement offer by Perenco on 21 May 2009, its representatives were summoned to meet Ecuador\u2019s Minister of Mines and Petroleum where, in the evidence of Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, they were informed that President Correa was offended by the settlement offer and Ecuador would not comply with the provisional measures recommendation. Subsequently, when Minister Palacios was replaced by Minister Pinto on 8 June 2009, representatives of Perenco met with him to discuss settlement terms. Minister Pinto\u2019s statements, according to Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, which were not disputed by Ecuador, maintained Ecuador\u2019s position that in order to cease *coactiva* enforcement measures, the Consortium would have to agree to pay all outstanding Law 42 amounts under a payment plan (amongst other conditions). Perenco did not agree to this. This pattem of interaction continued through to and during the course of the auction of the consortium\u2019s crude on 3 July 2009 and 20 July 2009.\n\n581.\n\nListing these measures, taken over a period of some four years, illustrates the deepening and intensification of the State\u2019s demands and actions. When evaluating the international lawfulness of Law 42 at 50%, however, the Tribunal will consider this measure separately from the measures which ensued. In the course of this analysis, it will be evident that certain of the Tribunal\u2019s determinations in regard to the alleged breaches of contract assume importance in the Treaty claim. To some extent, the Treaty analysis mirrors the contract analysis. However, in contrast to its contractual jurisdictional mandate, in exercising its jurisdiction to apply the Treaty, the Tribunal is not bound by Ecuadorian law or by the courts\u2019 interpretation of that law, although it will defer to an authoritative interpretation of the domestic law.\n\n*b. Law 42 at 50%*\n------------------\n\n582.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with some comments on the relationship between the Constitutional Court proceedings and the Treaty claims, the characterisation of Law 42 for the purposes of international law, and a reference to a prior investment treaty case that has considered windfall taxes. With respect to this latter point, the Tribunal considers that the substantial upwards movement of oil prices in the last decade fell outside of the expectations of the original parties to the Participation Contracts and generated windfall profits. The expert evidence before the Tribunal shows that Ecuador\u2019s initial response thereto was not unlike that of many other States.\n\n583.\n\nTurning to the Consitutional Court\u2019s decision, the fact that the Court has spoken on Law 42\u2019s constitutionality does not of course preclude this Tribunal from exercising its jurisdiction under the Treaty to consider the international lawfulness of Law 42. But in applying international law, the Tribunal does not act as a court of appeal on questions of Ecuadorian law. This jurisdictional limit is well-established in the jurisprudence.915 The Tribunal must recognise the allocation of competencies between adjudicatory bodies at the national and international levels. An international tribunal cannot second-guess the court's interpretation and application of local law.916 At the same time, under well-established principles of international law, as codified in Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the fact that a law has been declared constitutional by the local courts, even by the highest court of the land, is not dispositive of whether it was in conformity with international law.917\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian & Ellen Baca v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award (1 November 1999), paragraph 99; *Mondev International Ltd. v.

Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award (6 May 2013), paragraph 238.\n\nAs found in the section on the alleged breaches of contract, for this reason, the Tribunal does not accept certain of Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose\u2019s criticisms.\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian & Ellen Baca v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award (1 November 1999), paragraph 98; *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.E v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award (2 August 2006), paragraphs 212-214; *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ARB/01/13, Procedural Order No. 2 (16 October 2002), paragraph 28.\n\n584.\n\nAs for the proper characterisation of Law 42, the Tribunal has already found that for the purposes of the contractual claims, Law 42 is to be characterised as a taxation measure. In the context of the Treaty claim, it has carefully considered Perenco\u2019s complaint as to Ecuador\u2019s \"opportunistic\" change in the measure\u2019s characterisation between the constitutional court proceedings and this international arbitration:918\n\nEcuador cannot have it both ways: it cannot both insist it is entitled to special deference when exercising its powers of taxation, and insist that it is not engaged in taxation when it desires to sidestep its contractual obligations related to taxation.919\n\nReply, paragraph 188.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 191.\n\n585.\n\nWhile it is possible for a measure to be characterised differently under different legal systems, the municipal and international, the Respondent's inconsistency in characterisation depending upon the forum and applicable law is troubling. In the end, following the approach taken in *EnCana v. Ecuador* when it comes to determining whether a measure is to be characterised as a tax for the purposes of international law, the Tribunal has concluded that it should focus on the Law 42\u2019s substantive effect (i.e., whether a liability was imposed upon a class of persons to pay a portion of \"extraordinary revenues\" to and for the benefit of the State).920 It is buttressed in this conclusion by the fact that the law\u2019s characterisation during the Constitutional Court proceeding in no way precluded Perenco itself from characterising it as a tax which gave rise to its right to claim a modification of the Contracts.921\n\n*EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA, Award (3 February 2006) (EL-94), paragraph 142: \"A taxation law is one which imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes.\"\n\nExhibits E-129, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December 2006 (Block 21) and E-130, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December 2006 (Block 7).\n\n586.\n\nAs a final introductory comment, it is well recognised in investment treaty arbitration that States retain flexibility to respond to changing circumstances unless they have stabilised their relationship with an investor. In *Paushok v. Mongolia,* for example, the tribunal discussed the claimant\u2019s expectations in relation to a windfall tax, noting:\n\nThere is no doubt that the [Windfall Profit Tax] represented a radical change in the taxation of the gold mining industry in Mongolia and that it had a severe negative impact upon the industry as a whole and upon GEM in particular. But this does not mean that the enactment of such legislation was contrary to the Treaty. An investor, without an agreement which limits or prohibits the possibility of tax increases, should not be surprised to be hit with tax increases in subsequent years and such an event could not be considered as \u2018unpredictable\u2019. Mongolia is far from being the only country in the world were dramatic unforeseen increases in the price of certain commodities has led to major changes in taxation regimes of those commodities. Before concluding that a particular taxation level alters \u2018the predictability of the business and legal framework\u2019 of a country, an international arbitration tribunal will want to see a clear demonstration that, absent such an agreement, such increase in taxation constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that country.922\n\n*Sergei Paushok, CSJC Golden East Company and CSLC Vostokneftegaz Company v. Republic of Mongolia,* UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability (28 April 2011) (EL-103), paragraph 305.\n\n587.\n\n*Paushok\u2019* s emphasis on \"an agreement which limits or prohibits the possibility of tax increases\" underscores the significance of the Tribunal\u2019s finding that although there was such an agreement in this case, it was not adequately pursued such as to be shown to have been futile in 2007 (until the application of Decree 662). It further underscores the Tribunal\u2019s earlier finding that to the extent that Perenco\u2019s expectations are derived from its contractual rights, the Contracts *as a whole,* including their taxation modification clauses, not just the \"economic bargain\" clauses, must be considered.\n\n588.\n\nThe Tribunal also sees support in *Paushok* for its view that a consideration of legitimate expectations should include a consideration of industry practices and expectations. Given the oil industry\u2019s typically expected returns and its experience with governmental responses to market changes, it would be unsurprising to an experienced oil company that given its access to the State\u2019s exhaustible natural resources, with the substantial increase in world oil prices, there was a chance that the State would wish to revisit the economic bargain underlying the contracts.923 In its pleadings, Perenco itself emphasised its good faith efforts to negotiate with Ecuador.924 In Perenco\u2019s statements and in its conduct, the Tribunal sees evidence of this type of business judgement (albeit one exercised in increasingly difficult conditions). Perenco\u2019s repeated efforts to reach a mutually satisfactory adjustment of its relationship with Ecuador is consistent with Fair Links\u2019 description of the oil industry\u2019s general experience with the renegotiation of oil contracts in changed circumstances.925\n\nIn its 1st Report, Fair Links commented at paragraph 62: \"...as the owners of the non-renewable resources, States will inevitably determine how to share the extractive revenue with the extractive companies. Where the extractive revenues significantly outstrip the reasonable expected returns due to contractors, there is no general assumption in the industry that the extractive company will enjoy the entirety of the windfall profits. On the contrary, States do generally intervene (and have historically intervened) to reassert a proportionate share of extractive revenues above those which would reasonably be due to contractors for their investment, risk and industrial performance, i.e. their reasonable initial economic expectations.\" This led it to comment in its Summary 3: *\"Since the State is the owner of the non-renewable resources, investors with concession-type contracts inelastic to price would reasonably expect the State to find solutions in a high-price scenario to reassert a proportionate share of extractive revenues above those which would reasonably be due to contractors for their investment, risk and industrial performance, i.e. their reasonable initial economic expectations.\"* [Italics in original.]\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 168-169.\n\n1st Expert Report of Fair Links, paragraph 62.\n\n589.\n\nWith these points in mind, the Tribunal turns to its consideration of the Article 4 claims.\n\n*c. Did Law 42 violate Article 4?*\n----------------------------------\n\n590.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s three findings in respect to the taxation modification clauses made in its breach of contract analysis apply equally to the Article 4 claim: (i) the Contracts\u2019 taxation modification clauses were drafted to encompass new forms of taxation such as Law 42; (ii) new taxes *per se* did not generate an automatic adjustment in the \u2018X\u2019 factor; and (iii) Perenco did not prove that resort to this contractual remedy was futile.\n\n591.\n\nThe Tribunal is presented with a situation where organs of the State other than Perenco\u2019s contractual counterparty modified the Contracts\u2019 operation through the exercise of sovereign power not open to ordinary contracting parties. The market conditions in which the State acted were, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, quite extraordinary and the widespread array of measures taken by other States during this time satisfies the Tribunal that seeking an adjustment of the economic rent derived from exhaustible natural resources was not *per se* arbitrary, unreasonable or idiosyncratic.\n\n592.\n\nIt has already been found that Petroecuador was not automatically in breach of contract when the Congress enacted Law 42 or when the Executive fixed the 50% rate. Rather, Perenco was faced with a measure taken by the Congress which *could* give rise to a breach of contract if Petroecuador refused to negotiate or if, its having agreed to negotiate, it refused to accept persuasive evidence tendered by Perenco that Law 42 had adversely affected the Contracts\u2019 economy and/or refused to agree a correction factor. But just as it could not be found that Petroecuador was in breach of contract until such time as clauses 11.12/11.7 were tested and proven to be futile, subject to what is discussed below, it likewise cannot be found that Ecuador was in breach of Article 4 when it enacted Law 42 and began to collect payment of the amounts claimed to be due. It cannot be said at this point in the chronology of events, that Ecuador\u2019s having modified the Contracts\u2019 operation, it then foreclosed the exercise of Perenco\u2019s intra-contractual recourse (or for that matter precluded it from seeking recourse to contractual and Treaty arbitration). Had the contractual route been pressed and had Petroecuador refused to engage in negotiations as to the claimed disturbance of the Contract\u2019s economy or to agree on a correction factor, the situation before the Tribunal would have been different.\n\n593.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal would have little difficulty holding that a fully stabilised contract that did not admit of any future legislative or other change cannot be changed unilaterally, but this is not the case here.926 Insofar as this aspect of the fair and equitable treatment claim is concerned, given the precise expression of the parties\u2019 contractual rights and obligations, Perenco has not proven that resort to the taxation modification process would have been futile. Therefore, the Tribunal declines to find the Respondent in breach for enacting and applying Law 42.\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v.

Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award (17 March 2006) (EL-113), paragraph 304.\n\n594.\n\nWhile Perenco is correct to point out that Article 31-A of Hydrocarbons Law established that oil contracts may be amended provided that the contractor\u2019s consent is obtained and that this statutory premise was reflected in the Contracts themselves, if the prior modification negotiations process itself was not pursued, it cannot be held that this common consent could not have been reached. Clause 15.2 of both Contracts shows that the amendment of each Contract *follows* modification negotiations. Had such negotiations been pressed and resulted in a satisfactory adjustment of the Contracts\u2019 economic terms, the Contracts would have then been amended by consent of both parties.927\n\nFor example, clause 15.2 of the Block 21 Contract provided: **\"Contractual amendments:** Amending contracts may be negotiated and executed, by agreement of the Parties, in particular in the following cases:...c) When the tax regime, employee profit sharing or currency treatment applicable to this type of Contract in the country has been modified, in order to restore the economy of the Contract; f) Due to other reasons in the State\u2019s interests, duly agreed to by the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Contractor, in accordance with the Law. In the cases contemplated in items a), b), d), e), and f) above, the modification must be authorized by the Special Bidding Committee, upon prior favorable reports from the Attorney General, the Joint Command of the Armed Forces, PETROECUADOR\u2019S Administrative Council, and the Ministry of Energy and Mines. In the case of a modification pursuant to (c) above, only the authorization of PETROECUADOR\u2019S Administrative Council shall be required.\" (Exhibit CE-10, PER 04703) [Bolding in original.]\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal has attached such weight to the availability of the contractual remedy because it believes that, objectively speaking, the oil market conditions in 2006-07 were profoundly different from those prevailing at the time of contracting and that this fact could hardly be denied in negotiations. Perenco had evidently generated good financial returns and it behooved both parties to the Contracts to negotiate with a view to agreeing what impact Law 42 had on the economy of the Contracts in the changed market conditions and what was to be done about it.\n\n*d. The impediment claim*\n-------------------------\n\n596.\n\nAs noted earlier, Perenco also relies upon the prohibition against a Contracting Party\u2019s impeding the management, preservation, use, enjoyment or transfer of the investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. The Tribunal considers that while they were certainly affected by the application of Law 42, the management, preservation, use, etc. of Perenco\u2019s investments were not impeded.\n\n597.\n\nThe Tribunal finds support for its conclusion in the following evidence.\n\n598.\n\nFirst, Law 42 at 50% was restricted specifically to the question of so-called \"extraordinary revenues\" and did not purport to impede the management, preservation, use, of Perenco Ecuador Ltd. itself or its investments.\n\n599.\n\nSecond, it did not purport to fundamentally alter the structure of the contracts. Perenco continued to be entitled to the volumes calculated pursuant to the contracts, and 50% of the extraordinary revenues generated therefrom. Throughout this period, Perenco was free to use its investments to generate substantial revenues.\n\n600.\n\nThird, there is no persuasive record evidence that Law 42 at 50% \"blunted further investment\".928 The Tribunal has already referred to Mr. Spink\u2019s testimony with respect to Perenco\u2019s expectation that it expected to recover relatively quickly the capital invested if oil remained at US $20/barrel. If it could do so at US $20/barrel, it could do so at say, US $40 or US $50/barrel with the parties splitting the extraordinary revenues above the reference price. Indeed, in November 2006 (some six months after Law 42\u2019s enactment), the consortium submitted an amendment to the development plan for Block 7 related to the Oso field. The consortium considered three price scenarios for the 2007-2010 period; two of the three considered the price of oil at above the Law 42 reference price of US $29.6 (i.e., at US $34/barrel and US $39/barrel). All three scenarios showed significant positive cash flows to the contractors and in fact higher positive cash flows then would have resulted had the price of oil been below the reference price.929 After the plan was approved, commencing in April 2006 through to October 2007, the consortium invested an additional US $61 million and drilled an additional 15 wells in the field.930 Had Law 42 at 50% truly impeded the management, use, etc. of the investments, the development plan would not have been pursued.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 176.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 601-606, Exhibit E-77, 2006 Oso Development Plan, p 134; Exhibit E-128, Ministry of Energy and Mines Decree No. 40 approving the 2006 Oso Development Plan dated 9 March 2007 (in Spanish with English translation), p 4.\n\nWitness Statement of Lament Combe, paragraph 20.\n\n601.\n\nOn the basis of the available record evidence, therefore, the Tribunal considers that in 2006-2007, with the then-prevailing price of Napo and Oriente crude and with Law 42 at 50%, Perenco was still generating significant cash flows and appeared to be quite profitable. Obviously, it was not enjoying the windfall that it would have enjoyed in the absence of Law 42, but until the amount claimed by the State was increased to 99%, Perenco still generated a greater cash flow than its business case assumed in its due diligence performed when acquiring Kerr McGee\u2019s interests in the two blocks.\n\n602.\n\nIn all of the circumstances, therefore, the Tribunal finds that Law 42 *per se* did not amount to a breach of Article 4 of the Treaty.\n\n*e. Law 42 at 99%*\n------------------\n\n603.\n\nIt has already been found that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts by increasing Ecuador\u2019s participation to 99% of the value of all sales of oil above the reference price and thus effectively removing virtually all of the upside potential above the reference prices. It also marked the beginning of demands for the contractors to make a transition to service contracts.\n\n604.\n\nPerenco argued in connection with the effect of Decree 662 that:\n\nThere can be no question that this \u2018change in the legal framework\u2019 was fundamental. No dissection of individual contractual provisions or sophisticated economic analysis is required to appreciate that if the State takes 99% of revenue over a given reference price, that is effectively the same thing as a services contract with a fee in the amount of that reference price. In both instances the investor has no opportunity to participate in the upside of higher oil prices.931\n\nReply, paragraph 290.\n\n605.\n\nIt elaborated upon this point in the course of discussing the *ADC v. Hungary* award:\n\nIn the present case Ecuador likewise took aim at the foundations of the contracts and effectively destroyed them. Its unilateral abrogation of one of the essential features of the participation contract - namely, the prospect of upside benefits - is conceptually akin to outlawing contracts containing such provisions altogether. Of course, through *caducidad,* Ecuador rendered impossible any continued operations at all.932\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 411.\n\n606.\n\nThe Tribunal has already made a finding to this effect (at paragraphs 407 to 410). It agrees with Perenco\u2019s argument that the application of the law at 99% rendered a participation contract essentially the same as a service contract. Moreover, Decree 662 marked the beginning of a series of other measures in breach of Article 4 taken in relation to the Participation Contracts, namely: (i) demanding that the contractors agree to surrender their rights under their participation contracts and migrate to what for a considerable period of time was an unspecified model, such that the contractors were unable to discern precisely what they were being asked to move to; (ii) escalating negotiating demands, in particular in April 2008 when the President unexpectedly suspended the negotiations and rejected what had recently been achieved in a Partial Agreement in respect of one of the blocks; (iii) making coercive and threatening statements, including threats of expulsion from Ecuador; and (iv) taking steps to enforce Law 42 against Perenco (and Burlington) for non-payment of dues claimed to be owing, a portion of which has been held to be in breach of Article 4, and when no payments were made, forcibly seizing and selling the oil produced in Blocks 7 and 21 in order to realise the claimed Law 42 debt. This set the stage for the Consortium\u2019s suspension of operations and ultimately the declaration of *caducidad* which formally terminated the Consortium\u2019s rights in the two blocks.\n\n607.\n\nThe Tribunal has already noted that Ecuador has not contested the Claimant\u2019s assertion that Decree 662 was intended to force a renegotiation of the participation contracts in order to migrate Petroecuador\u2019s counterparties to service contracts.933 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, moving beyond 50% to 99% with the application of Decree 662 amounted to a breach of Article 4 of the Treaty and the measures, taken collectively, just listed also constituted breaches of Article 4.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 626; Rejoinder, paragraphs 13-14; Perenco in its Reply, at paragraph 287, asserted that the Respondent had conceded \"that the motive for these contractual amendments was to achieve the State\u2019s goal of imposing services contracts in place of participation contracts, thus undoing what the prior governments had done.\"\n\n608.\n\nDecree 662 had the intended effect of inducing the Consortium to write to Petroecuador setting out a financial proposal for the renegotiation of the two Participation Contracts. Discussions between the parties led Petroecuador and Perenco to sign Minutes of Partial Agreement on 11 March 2008 in relation to Block 7 which, if implemented, would have: (i) permitted Perenco to operate the block under the participation contract model for a period of five years after which it would be migrated to another contract model; (ii) would have extended its contractual term, scheduled to expire in 2010, to 2018; (iii) would have increased the State\u2019s participation share for the period 2008-2010 and then have it linked to oil prices for the period 2010-2018; and (iv) would have amended the statutory reference price to US $42.50/barrel.934\n\nExhibit E-84, *Acta de Acuerdo Parcial* signed by Perenco and Petroecuador dated 11 March 2008.\n\n609.\n\nThe Tribunal is hesitant to accord much weight to tentative agreements negotiated under conditions of such duress because Perenco can reasonably say that all such negotiations were intended to make the best of a bad situation. That said, it appears that at least some of the damage which ensued from Decree 662 could have been avoided had the parties been able to put what was agreed in the March 2008 Partial Agreement into a final, executed amending contract for Block 7 (and had they concluded a similar amending contract for Block 21). A review of the terms shows that the arrangement was capable of benefiting both Perenco and the State, and their contractual relationship would have been modified by agreement.\n\n610.\n\nHowever, on 12 April 2008, without advance notice to Perenco (or it appears to any of the other oil companies then engaged in discussions with the State), President Correa announced that the negotiations would be suspended and all existing production sharing contracts would be terminated unilaterally with the result that new contracts would be signed by the oil companies. In making this announcement, President Correa asserted:\n\nI said 45 days, I think in January, for renegotiation of the contracts... *We were close to a deal, but I stopped it, because, even though we ve secured major benefits, I think that we can do better.935*\n\nExhibit CE-69, *Negotiations with oil companies come to a halt,* El Comercio (online edition), 13 April 2008 *(in* *Spanish with English translation),* available at http://www2.elcomercio.com/noticiaEC.asp?id\\_noticia=184277&id\\_seccion=3. *Correa proposes \"single model\" for contracts with foreign oil companies,* El Diario (online edition), 14 April 2008 *(in Spanish with English translation),* available at http://www.eldiario.com.ee/noticias-manabi-ecuador/75940. *Government to propose six month agreement with oil companies,* El Comercio (online edition), 15 April 2008 (in *Spanish with English translation),* available at http://www2.elcomercio.com/noticiaEC.asp?id noticia=184439&id seccion=6. p 8 [Emphasis added.].\n\n611.\n\nTwo days after this announcement, Perenco wrote to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum expressing its \"deep concern derived from the Ecuadorian Government\u2019s announcement to put an end to the current negotiations.\"936 This was followed two weeks later with the resolution of the Board of Directors of Perenco S.A. to commence ICSID arbitration against Ecuador and Petroecuador.937 At this point, Perenco and Burlington began to withhold payments of Law 42 dues, depositing the same instead into a segregated account located outside of Ecuador.938\n\nExhibit CE-70, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador regarding payment under protest of Law 42 assessment and negotiations of contracts, 15 April 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 02198.\n\nExhibit CE-202, Extract of Board of Directors Meeting Minutes of Perenco S.A., 30 April 2008.\n\nAs noted by the Tribunal at paragraphs 11 and 30 of its Decision on Provisional Measures; Exhibit CE-208, Letter from Perenco to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador, regarding the Provisional Measures decision, 11 May 2009 (in Spanish with English translation), PER T-03683.\n\n612.\n\nThe evidence suggests that Perenco could have lived with the March Partial Agreement. Obviously, it would have preferred the existing contractual regime and no Law 42, and it was negotiating under the considerable pressure of Decree 662, but the Tribunal considers that Perenco\u2019s persistent efforts to achieve a mutually acceptable renegotiation of its contracts supports the finding that it would have accepted the terms of the Partial Agreement had they not been repudiated in April.939\n\nIn this regard, the evidence of Mr. Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, the Country Manager for Perenco in Ecuador at the relevant time is that by \"April 2008, Perenco was making what [he] considered to be good progress towards a deal with the Government. The deal being discussed would have given Ecuador a greater participation than it was entitled to under the Participation Contracts, but also contained some potential benefits for Perenco and Burlington\": see 1st Witness Statement of Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, paragraph 8. Similarly, Mr. Derlis Palacios, who was the Minister of Mines and Petroleum until June 2009, confirms in his written evidence that Ecuador perceived Perenco\u2019s intention at this time to be to enter into transitory agreements with the State and that \"Burlington was the problem.\": 1st Witness Statement of Mr. Derlis Palacios, paragraphs 7-10.\n\n613.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledged that the President\u2019s decision to hasten the migration of the contracts to service contracts within a year had the effect of suspending negotiations with all of the oil companies, including Perenco.940 Under increasingly difficult circumstances, Perenco continued to seek a negotiated solution.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 201; 1st Witness Statement of Minister Galo Chiriboga, paragraph 16: the President\u2019s decision resulted in \"confusion and concern amongst contractors and delayed negotiations for a couple of weeks, while companies consulted with their representatives or head offices.\"\n\n614.\n\nNegotiations resumed in May 2008 with Ecuador submitting a new draft Transitory Agreement pursuant to which: (i) the parties would make their \"best efforts\" to migrate to a service contract within 120 days (the model for which had not yet been developed by the State\u2019s external legal advisers); (ii) Perenco would be obliged to maintain the levels of investment originally proposed for 2008; and (iii) the ICSID proceedings would be suspended.941 Perenco objected to these proposed terms.942 In its view, they were less advantageous than the terms of the March Partial Agreement, and at this time, the draft proposed service contracts was not available for review which meant that the contractors\u2019 commitment to the Transitory Agreement would be sight unseen as to the terms of the contract to which they were expected to migrate.943\n\nExhibit CE-273, Ecuador draft \"transitional negotiation agreement,\" 16 May 2008 (in Spanish with English translation) PER 04502.\n\nExhibit CE-274, Letter from the Consortium to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador, 13 June 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 04507.\n\nMinister Chiriboga in oral testimony before the Tribunal confirmed that as of June 2008, the draft proposed service contracts had not been provided to contractors: Transcript, Hearing on Merits, Day 4, p 992.\n\n615.\n\nOn 10 July 2008, Ecuador proposed another draft Transitory Agreement which, if implemented, would require Perenco to migrate to a service contract within one year of its execution.944 This too was rejected by Perenco on the grounds that the new agreement\u2019s terms were \"substantially similar\" to those of the May 2008 Transitory Agreement and were unacceptable.945\n\nThis occurred in the midst of attempts by Perenco to reach a compromise with representatives of the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador regarding the disputed Law 42 payments that had or would become due pending the arbitration or any agreed transitory agreement. For example, Perenco by letter dated 19 June 2008 sought a meeting with Petroecuador to discuss the \"possibility of a mutually agreeable solution regarding disputed Law 42 payments that become due\" and proposed the option of transferring the disputed payments into an escrow account maintained by an independent escrow agent in a neutral location: Exhibit CE-072, Letter from Perenco and Burlington to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador proposing an escrow account for transfer of disputed Law 42 payments, 19 June 2008 (in Spanish and English).\n\nThe draft transitory agreement included a \"commitment clause\" for companies to migrate to a service-model contract within one year, replaced the existing provision which dealt with the modification of the tax regime with a provision subrogating the rights of the contractor to the domestic taxation regime with no exception or contractual review mechanism, and included a clause \"modifying the Arbitration Center\" to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, requiring parties to go through a series of consultation and mediations before submitting the dispute to arbitration, and excluding disputes which arise from or are connected to taxation matters: Exhibits E-85, Letter from the Minister of Mines and Petroleum to Perenco and other Companies dated 10 July 2008 and CE-74, Letter from Perenco and Burlington to Ecuador showing disagreement with draft agreement proposed by Ecuador, 16 July2008 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\n616.\n\nIn late July 2008, Minister Chiriboga informed Perenco that he had instructed Petroecuador to terminate the negotiation process.946\n\nExhibit CE-76, Letter from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum to Perenco terminating negotiations regarding the amendment of the Participation Contract for Block 7, 28 July 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 02227; Counter-Memorial, paragraph 207; Reply, paragraph 94.\n\n617.\n\nAt this point the record shows that Burlington decided that it would prefer to divest itself of its assets in Ecuador rather than migrate to a service contract.947 This created yet another problem for Perenco. As the consortium operator, Perenco was negotiating on its own behalf but it was also, from the government\u2019s perspective, negotiating on behalf of Burlington. Under the terms of its contractual relationship with Burlington, it appears that Perenco could not bind Burlington to a renegotiated contract which might be acceptable to Perenco but not to Burlington.948 Burlington declined to be bound by Perenco\u2019s efforts to arrive at a negotiated solution.\n\nExhibit E-86, Letter from Burlington to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum dated 10 September 2008.\n\nExhibit E-91, Letter from Burlington to Perenco dated 16 December 2008: \"...wish to clarify that Burlington is not under any legal obligation of any kind to sign the draft agreements. Burlington is entitled to stand on its rights under existing PSCs, and those rights cannot be modified without Burlington\u2019s effective participation.\"\n\n618.\n\nThe Tribunal can understand why Burlington arrived at this conclusion. In his letter to Perenco dated 18 August 2008, Minister Chiriboga commented:\n\n[T]he Ecuadorian State maintains its position of converting all participation contracts to services contracts, which, among other matters, include changing from ICSID arbitration to regional arbitration...fiscal sovereignty, so that tax issues will not be subject to arbitration but to the country\u2019s courts; fulfillment of the contractual obligations of the company and of Law 42; and the withdrawal of your claims before the ICSID.949\n\nExhibit CE-279, Letter from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum to Perenco and Burlington, 18 August 2008 (in Spanish with English translation), PER 04521.\n\n619.\n\nThis contemplated a very different contractual arrangement from that which had prevailed up to President Correa\u2019s announcement in April 2008. Moreover, even though Burlington\u2019s refusal to negotiate changes to its contractual rights fell outside of Perenco\u2019s control, this was essentially held against Perenco.950\n\nThe evidence of Minister Chiriboga at paragraph 25 of his 1st Witness Statement is that was clear by the fourth quarter of 2008 that \"Burlington\u2019s refusal to accept a new agreement with the State [made] it impossible to reach a definitive agreement with respect to blocks 7 and 21 with Perenco.\"\n\n620.\n\nNotwithstanding the obstacles and the State\u2019s shift away from the approach recorded in the first Partial Agreement, Perenco continued to seek a negotiated solution.951 In October 2008, negotiations resumed and on 3 October and 17 October the two parties reached another Partial Agreement for Blocks 7 and 21, respectively. At this point, the partial agreement contained the following points: (i) the principle of migrating to a service contract; (ii) a higher statutory reference price (US $42.50/barrel for Block 7 and US $48/barrel for Block 21); (iii) the application of the LET rate of taxation (70%) in lieu of Law 42 at 99%; and (iv) a guaranteed investment of US $110 million, supported by a commitment from a parent company guarantee.952\n\nPerenco\u2019s response to Ecuador\u2019s terms of negotiation in a letter in its own name dated 27 August 2008 to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, stating it was intent on and ready to begin negotiations with Ecuador on 1 September 2008 with a view to replacing the Participation Contracts with service contracts and with the issue of the pendency of the ICSID arbitration on the table: Exhibit CE-280, Letter from Perenco to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, 27 August 2008 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\nExhibits E-87, *Acta de Acuerdo Parcial* signed by Perenco and Petroecuador dated 3 October 2008 (Block 7) and E-89, *Acta de Acuerdo Parcial* signed by Perenco and Petroecuador dated 17 October 2008 (Block 21).\n\n621.\n\nThis Partial Agreement also foundered. Perenco sent comments on the draft agreement on 31 October (for Block 7) and 7 November (for Block 21), and this was followed up with a letter to Petroecuador\u2019s negotiating team confirming its agreement with the terms but stating it could not sign the draft agreements which had since been approved by Ecuadorian government agencies without its comments having been taken into account.953\n\nExhibit CE-282, Letter from Perenco to Petroecuador, 12 November 2008 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\n622.\n\nThe bigger problem was that after Perenco informed Burlington that following extensive negotiations it had reached a draft transitory agreement that was \"acceptable to both Perenco on the one hand, and the Government of Ecuador and Petroecuador on the other\" Burlington would not go along with the proposed agreement.954 Burlington informed Perenco that it would not sign the draft transitory agreement.955 The agreement could not become effective without Burlington\u2019s participation.\n\nExhibit E-90, Letter from Perenco to Burlington dated 27 November 2008. The minutes of what would become the Partial Agreement for Block 7 were earlier provided to Burlington and on 7 October 2008, Burlington informed Petroecuador that it did not accept those terms, reiterating its intention to sell its interest in Blocks 7 and 21 : Exhibit E-88, Letter from Burlington to Petroecuador dated 7 October 2008.\n\nExhibit E-91, Letter from Burlington to Perenco dated 16 December 2008.\n\n623.\n\nPerenco was then informed by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum that since it had been impossible to reach an agreement due to Burlington\u2019s \"intransigent position,\" Perenco should appoint a team to negotiate the reversion of Block 7 (then scheduled to expire in August 2010) and that it should \"immediately assign its negotiating team to early termination of the Block 21 contract, by mutual agreement\" even though that block was not set to expire until 2021.956\n\nExhibit CE-81, Letter from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum to Perenco regarding the process of reverting of Block 7 and early termination of the Participation Contract for Block 21, 23 December 2008 (in Spanish with English translation); 1st Witness Statement of Mr. Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, paragraph 18.\n\n624.\n\nPerenco asked the Minister to reconsider the position in view of the fact that the parties were so close to an amicable solution.957 However, Minister Derlis Palacios stated publicly on 21 January 2009 that negotiations with Perenco and Burlington were \"practically impossible\".958\n\nExhibit CE-289, Letter from Perenco to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, 8 January 2009 (in Spanish with English translation).\n\nMinister Derlis Palacios as quoted by Ecuador\u2019s *El comercio* in a 21 January 2009 article entitled, \"Government will seek to terminate contract with Perenco after negotiations fail\": Exhibit CE-84, PER 02336.\n\n625.\n\nAs noted below some further negotiations occurred in 2009, but they too foundered. The Respondent argued that their failure was attributable to Perenco.959 The Tribunal does not see it that way. In its view, the negotiations failed due to the State\u2019s escalating demands and its view that Perenco was responsible for ensuring that Burlington agreed to the terms of the tentative deals.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 199, 210-211, 219\n\n626.\n\nInsofar as the separate claim of breach of Article 4\u2019s impediment provision is concerned, the Tribunal considers that although Perenco\u2019s management, preservation, and use of the Blocks was unimpeded by the application of Decree 662, its enjoyment of the investment was impeded. This constitutes a separate breach of Article 4.\n\n627.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that: (i) Law 42\u2019s enactment did not breach Article 4; (ii) moving beyond 50% to 99% with the application of Decree 662 to Perenco as well as the ensuing measures just discussed breached Article 4. The Tribunal now turns to the events leading up to the declaration of *caducidad.*\n\n*f. The declaration of* Caducidad\n---------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nThe Tribunal has already discussed the history of the Decision on Provisional Measures in the Facts and in the course of its decision on Perenco\u2019s invocation of the defence of *exceptio non adimpleti contractus.* It is unnecessary to repeat the chronology. Suffice to say that on 13 July 2009 the Consortium gave notice of its intention to suspend operations. This set in train the events that led to the declaration of *caducidad* on 20 July 2010 which brought the Contracts to an end.\n\n629.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in contrast to the contractual claims, the carve-out of caducity in Block 7 from the Tribunal\u2019s contractual jurisdiction can have no effect on its jurisdiction to consider whether the declarations made in respect of both Contracts amount to a breach of Treaty.\n\n630.\n\nSince the declaration of *caducidad* is bound up with the Parties\u2019 submissions on whether Perenco suffered an expropriation, the Tribunal will defer its discussion of *caducidad* as a potential breach of fair and equitable treatment until after it it has considered the expropriation claim, to which it now turns.\n\n**C. Expropriation under Article 6 of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n631.\n\nArticle 6 of the Treaty precludes a Contracting Party from taking any expropriation or nationalisation measures \"or any other measures which would cause nationals and companies of the other Party to be dispossessed, directly or indirectly, of their investments\" unless it has satisfied certain conditions:\n\n1. The Contracting Parties shall not take any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other measures which would cause nationals and companies of the other Party to be dispossessed, directly or indirectly, of their investments (measures hereinafter referred to as \u2018expropriation measures\u2019) except for reasons of public necessity and on condition that such measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking made in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party between those nationals or companies and the host State. The legality of the expropriation shall be verifiable through regular judicial procedure.\n\nAny expropriation measures taken shall give rise to the payment of fair and adequate compensation equivalent to the real value of the investments in question and assessed on the basis of a normal economic situation prior to any threat of dispossession.\n\nSuch compensation, its amount and methods of payment shall be determined not later than the date of expropriation.

It shall yield, up to the date of payment, interest calculated on the basis of the market interest rate.960\n\nExhibit CE-07, Treaty, PER 00521.\n\n**(1) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n632.\n\nPerenco submitted that Ecuador\u2019s actions in enacting and implementing Law 42 amounted to an expropriation of its investment in Ecuador because (i) it deprived Perenco of its contractual right to an agreed participation percentage of the crude oil produced in the Blocks, (ii) it deprived Perenco of the benefits accruing from that contractual right; namely, the opportunity to earn further profits from the use of monies that could have been re-invested rather than paid as Law 42 dues; and (iii) as a result of the \"cumulative effect\" of the *coactiva* process, Ecuador\u2019s take-over of the Blocks, and declaration of *caducidad,* Perenco was divested of its rights and assets in Ecuador (in Perenco\u2019s submission, a \"complete taking\").\n\n633.\n\nPerenco\u2019s Reply clarified that Law 42 at 50% and at 99% were to be considered differently. Whereas the former was treated as part of a series of measures which culminated in a complete taking, at 99%, Law 42 was said to be \"economically devastating to Perenco\", constituting an expropriation \"in and of itself.\"961\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 192, 194; Reply, paragraphs 338, 343, 354-374, in particular 356.\n\n634.\n\nPerenco contended further that Ecuador had failed to discharge its burden of demonstrating that such measures were taken \"for reasons of public necessity\", were applied non-discriminatorily and were accompanied by \"fair and adequate compensation \u2018equivalent to the real value of the investments\u2019... determined \u2018not later than the date of the expropriation.\"962\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 186-187; Reply, paragraph 426; quoting from Article 6 of the Treaty.\n\n635.\n\nIn Perenco\u2019s submission, a measure qualified as an expropriation measure within the meaning of Article 6 if its effect was to deprive the investor of the fundamental rights of ownership and control of its investment.963 Put another way, a measure was expropriatory if it \"substantially] deprived] or effectively render[ed] useless an investor\u2019s property rights.\"964 In this regard, Perenco asserted that both *Alpha Projecktholding v. Ukraine* and *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* have recognised that in the case of indirect expropriation it is enough to demonstrate that the effect of the State\u2019s actions is to interfere with the rights of the investor to such an extent that these rights \"are rendered useless\", \"even though the State does not purport to have expropriated them and the legal title to the property formally remains with the original owner.\"965\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 188; Perenco relies on a number of tribunal decisions in support. For example, it refers to *Phelps Dodge Corp., et al v. The Islamic Republic of Iran,* Iran-US Claims Tribunal, Award (19 March 1987) (CA-285) for the proposition that \"the litmus test for determining whether a state action or series of actions rise to the level of expropriation is not the action itself, but rather \u2018the effects of the measures on the owner\u2019 and \u2018the reality of their impact.\u2019\" (Paragraph 22).\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 189.\n\n*Ibid.',* *Alpha Projecktholding GMBH v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16, Award (8 November 2010) (CA-281), paragraph 408, quoting from the Iran-US Claims Tribunal\u2019s decision in *Starrett Housing Corporation, Starrett Systems Inc, Starrett Housing International Inc v The Islamic Republic of Iran,* Award (CA-29), p 15; see also, *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008) (CA-5), paragraph 452.\n\n636.\n\nPerenco submitted that the \u2018rights\u2019 in question could extend to contractual rights, asserting that \"[deprivation of acquired contract rights is likewise expropriatory.\"966 It cited *Siemens v. Argentina* and *Eureko v. Poland* in support, contending that \"when a State exercises its public authority unilaterally to amend the key terms of a contract with an investor, with the effect of essentially depriving the investor of the contract\u2019s benefits, such a repudiation of acquired contract rights constitutes a measure tantamount to expropriation.\"967\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 190.\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 191. *Eureko B. V. v. Republic of Poland,* Partial Award (19 August 2005) (CA-13), paragraph 241: \"There is an amplitude of authority for the proposition that when a State deprives an investor of the benefit of its contractual rights, directly or indirectly, it may be tantamount to a deprivation in violation of the type of provision contained in Article 5 of the Treaty (expropriation). The deprivation of contractual rights may be expropriatory in substance and in effect.\"; *Siemens A.G. v The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award (6 February 2007) (CA-28), paragraph 267: \"There is a long judicial practice that recognizes that expropriation is not limited to tangible property.\"\n\n637.\n\nTo this end, it argued that Ecuador expropriated its investment in the Contracts by depriving it of a \"fundamental contract right\", defined as its \"agreed participation percentage.\"968 Moreover, by depriving Perenco of that key term, Ecuador had \"correspondingly deprived Perenco of the benefit of the investment, namely the opportunity to earn profits.\"969 It relied for this purpose on economic analyses prepared and annexed to the first witness statement of Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, and the evidence of its expert, Professor Kalt.970 Both submitted that in 2008, for example, the Consortium suffered a US $63 million loss, rather than benefiting from the US $229 million profit it projected it would have earned (of which Perenco would have enjoyed US $127,975 million) but for Law 42.971 Perenco asserted that from 2006 to 2008, the State \"increased its take from 58% to 110%\", that is, the share of net profits accruing to the State with Law 42 in effect increased from US $140,448,000 in 2006 (compared to Perenco\u2019s US $38,471,000), to US $375,800,000 in 2008 (compared to Perenco\u2019s US $34,939,000).972\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 192.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n1st Witness Statement of Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, paragraphs 26-32; Exhibits CE-116, Chart, 2006-2008 \"Take\" of available profits, and CE-117, Chart, Cost of foregone investment; Expert Report of Joseph P.

Kalt, paragraph 147 [Italics in original.].\n\n639.\n\nThe effect of the *coactivas,* subsequent to which Ecuador bought at auction the entire production of Blocks 7 and 21 for half and subsequently two-thirds of its market price, \"credit[ing] these sales against Perenco\u2019s alleged Law 42 \u2018debt\u2019 - at the reduced auction sale price\", all the while continuing to issue new Law 42 assessments against Perenco, \"created the perverse situation that not only was Perenco receiving no revenue at all from its production -not even money to cover operating costs - its Law 42 \u2018debt\u2019 actually continued to mount, while Ecuador made significant profits by reselling Perenco\u2019s oil at much higher market prices.\"975\n\nReply, paragraph 360. Perenco submitted that this placed it an impossible situation with respect to the remainder of the contractual term of the Block 7 Contract, and the foreseeable future of the contractual term of the Block 21 Contract. It relied on the evidence of Professor Kalt, stating it demonstrated that Perenco would have had a Law 42 burden of US $146 million when the Block 7 Contract expired, and with respect to the Block 21 Contract, it would have meant that Perenco faced a Law 42 burden of US $156 million at the beginning of 2009, and an additional US $163 million by the end of 2010 despite Petroecuador having seized and sold off the Block\u2019s crude for two years by that point. (Reply, paragraphs 361-362; Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt, Figure 20.)\n\n640.\n\nIn addition, Perenco relied on its analysis of \"foregone profits\", i.e. profits that it would have received and would have been entitled to use, but for Law 42, to further invest and drill new wells in Blocks 7 and 21, to claim an additional US $214 million.976\n\n1st Witness Statement of Mr. Eric d\u2019Argentr\u00e9, paragraph 27-29; Exhibit CE-117, Table of Profit for Foregone Investment.\n\n641.\n\nIn the third prong of Perenco\u2019s claim, it submitted that the Tribunal must consider the cumulative effect of the measures taken by Ecuador in connection with Law 42, relying on *Roslnvest Co UK Ltd v. Russian Federation,* a case in which a taxation investigation initiated by Russia and certain measures taken in relation thereto affected the claimant\u2019s ability to pay the additional taxes and penalties demanded by the State, eventually leading the State to seize and sell the claimant\u2019s assets in Russia.977 The *Roslnvest* tribunal accepted the argument that \u2018\"the totality of Respondent\u2019 [sic] measures were structured in such a way\u2019 as to result in a \u2018complete taking of all of the assets of [the investor] [amounting] to a nationalization or expropriation\u2019\" of its investment.978 Perenco argued similarly that \"[t]he \"cumulative effect\u2019 of Ecuador\u2019s measures, its enactment and enforcement of Law 42 through the seizure and sale of Perenco\u2019s crude, its physical take-over of the Blocks, and its actions to unilaterally terminate the Participation Contract, have equally resulted in a \u2018complete taking\u2019 of Perenco\u2019s assets\", amounting to an \"\u2018expropriation measure\u2019 under Article 6.\"979\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraphs 193-194; *Roslnvest Co UK Ltd v.

Rejoinder, paragraph 599.\n\n642.\n\nPerenco\u2019s rebuttal to any claim by Ecuador to the effect that the measures were legitimate regulatory measures was that Law 42 was pursued for an illegitimate public purpose, namely, to coerce oil companies such as Perenco to abandon their Participation Contracts.980 It relied on the decisions in *ADC v. Hungary* (a \"state\u2019s right to regulate within its domestic affairs is not unbounded\")981 and *AES v. Hungary* (\"[i]t cannot be considered a reasonable measure for a state to use its governmental powers to force a private party to change or give up its contractual rights\").982\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 196; Reply, paragraphs 340, 390-396 cf.

Rejoinder, section 5.3.5.4.\n\n644.\n\nEcuador similarly could not excuse its conduct by \"contending that its actions were permitted or even compelled by Ecuadorian law.\"985 This related to Ecuador\u2019s position in its Counter-Memorial that its actions to enforce Law 42 when Perenco halted payments, i.e., through the *coactivas,* intervention in the Blocks and ultimate declaration of *caducidad* were consequent to Perenco\u2019s failure to comply with Ecuadorian law.986 In response, Perenco submitted that Ecuador \"omit[ed] the fact that throughout this period it was acting in open defiance of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on provisional measures. As a matter of international law, it was Ecuador, not Perenco that was acting illegally.\"987\n\nRevised Memorial, paragraph 197.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 552 -553, and 559 and 561 and 563-565.\n\nReply, paragraph 340 cf.

First, it argued that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction because the *coactiva* notices were issued by the *Juzgado de Coactivas de Petroecuador,* and the Tribunal had already ruled that it did not have jurisdiction over Petroecuador.991 Second, Ecuador reiterated its objection to the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Tribunal to consider that part of Perenco\u2019s case which extended to claiming that the *caducidad* decrees \"completed\" the expropriation of Perenco\u2019s rights and property (or, alternatively, objected to the admissibility of the same).992\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 444, **fit.** 372, citing Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 242.3. Cf. Perenco\u2019s rebuttal at paragraph 346 of its Reply: \"[t]his argument fails for two reasons: (1) the Tribunal - at the urging of both Ecuador and Petroecuador - found that Petroecuador was an *agent* of the State (Jurisdiction Decision, paragraph 214), and it is a basic tent of law that the actions of the agent may be imputed to the principal; (2) under international law, the actions of a State entity are attributable to the State, *See* ILC Article, CA-22, Art. 5.\" [Italics in original.]\n\nCf. Perenco similarly reiteratef in response its submissions regarding the arbitrability of the claims relating to *caducidad* at section II.B of its Reply.\n\n647.\n\nTurning to the merits, Ecuador submitted in the first instance that Perenco had wrongly conflated the effect of Law 42 and the actions subsequent to it taken in response to Perenco\u2019s failure to comply with Ecuadorian law.993 It asserted that \"international law does not require a State to compensate any loss resulting from the taking of valid and legitimate police powers measures to enforce its law in response to a foreign investor\u2019s (such as Perenco) [sic] illegal behavior.\"994 The *coactivas,* Ecuador\u2019s intervention in the Blocks and declaring the *caducidad* of the Contracts were actions \"validly and legitimately taken by Ecuador in response to Perenco\u2019s own illegal behavior.\"995*Caducidad,* in particular, was declared, not because Perenco had failed to make Law 42 payments, but rather because \"Perenco abandoned Blocks 7 and 21 in the face of repeated requests by Ecuador over a period of 12 months to resume operations.\"996 This, Ecuador submitted, namely, Perenco\u2019s withholding of Law 42 dues starting in 2008 and its decision to leave the Blocks in July 2009, was part of a \u2018manufactured self-expropriation exit strategy\u2019997 since it had concluded by this time that \"potentially greater value could be had for the Consortium by withholding Law 42 and Decree 662 dues over the short-term\", and pursuing a claim for lost profits in an arbitration than could be \"gained through paying Law 42 and Decree 662 dues as required and operating the fields until the scheduled end of the Participation Contracts.\"998\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 551 ; Rejoinder, paragraph 574.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 552; citing R.A.

Mongolia,* which considered the legality of a 68% windfall profits tax and the claimant\u2019s argument that it exceeded \"international standards\" limiting the right of the State to tax.1009 The tribunal concluded that the \"[c]laimants ha[d] not established the existence of such standards. At best, they ha[d] succeeded in demonstrating that such legislation went beyond the taxation levels in application at the time in most countries of the world [...] The fact that a particular country happens to have, at a particular time, the highest taxation level affecting a certain industry does not automatically mean that there has been a breach of a BIT.\"1010 The tribunal also concluded that an \u2018excessive\u2019 tax was not presumptively an arbitrary and unreasonable one.1011\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 547-548 cf. Reply, paragraph 377.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 548.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 548 and 550.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n653.\n\nIn this light, Ecuador submitted that Perenco was required to demonstrate first that Law 42 was arbitrary and unreasonable, falling outside of the bounds of a State\u2019s police powers, and second, that it had a direct or indirect expropriatory effect on its investment in Ecuador, and finally, that it had been applied discriminatorily, was abusive in purpose or involved a denial of due process.1012 It asserted that Perenco\u2019s submission fell far short; characterising it as limited to arguing that *\"any* measure taken by a State even in a legitimate exercise of its regulatory powers and in response to the investor\u2019s illegal behavior, could amount to an expropriation if it [affected] the investor\u2019s property rights [...] an absurd proposition, which [found] no support in international law.\"1013\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 551; Rejoinder, paragraphs 602-605.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 554-556 [Emphasis in original.].\n\n654.\n\nResponding to Perenco\u2019s reliance on *ADC v. Hungary* for the proposition that a State\u2019s right to regulate \"is not unbounded\", Ecuador distinguished that case on its facts, stating that that tribunal considered legislation that did not just \"radically alter\" the regulatory regime applicable to the contractual relationship between the parties, but \"rendered the object of such contract illegal under Hungarian law.\"1014 Ecuador instead drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to two other decisions, *AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v. The Republic of Hungary1015* and again *Paushok v. Mongolia1016,* which it submitted more analogously dealt with the implementation of \u2018luxury\u2019 or \u2018windfall\u2019 profits and rightly found that it was necessary for the claimant to demonstrate that the tax was arbitrary or unreasonable, bringing it outside the bounds of the legitimate exercise of regulatory police powers.1017 It stated that Perenco had not discharged this burden and would fail to do so because Law 42 was enacted in the *bona fide* exercise of Ecuador\u2019s police powers as evidenced by the following:1018\n\n(i) Ecuador had a constitutional mandate to seek a fair allocation of revenues derived from its hydrocarbons resources \"and a duty to legislate to deal with the unexpected and excessive increase in oil prices.\"1019\n\n(ii) The legislative intent of Law 42 was to remedy a disequilibrium \"caused by a massive and unforeseen increase in oil prices.\"1020\n\n(iii) Law 42 was not discriminatory, it was a general measure adopted by Ecuador to \"restore the economics of its participation contracts with all private companies in like circumstances in light of the unexpected increase in oil prices\" and \"was not specifically aimed at Perenco or at foreign investors exclusively.\"1021\n\n(iv) Law 42 was duly enacted, in accordance with Ecuadorian law.\n\n(v) The Constitutional Court in Ecuador affirmed Law 42\u2019s constitutionality. In Ecuador\u2019s submission, it \"affirmed the constitutionality of all of the substantive provisions of Law 42 and the fact that it did not modify the Participation Contracts.\"1022\n\nIn this regard, Ecuador further reiterated that the purpose of Law 42 and Decree 662 should be considered separately from that of the *coactiva* process and *caducidad,* which Ecuador submitted did \"not have the same public purpose\", namely, the enforcement of Ecuadorian law.1023\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 555, citing *ADC* (CA-1) at paragraphs 181 and 186: Following the issuance of the decree, ADC was informed that \"further performance of the contracts have been rendered impossible, and thus the [contracts] shall lapse and become void as of 1 January 2002.\" Perenco in its Reply, at paragraph 380 contends that distinguishing ADC *v Hungary* on the facts does not \"detract from its point of principle\", namely that a State is bound to honour the investment-protection obligations it undertakes in an investment treaty.\n\nAES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft. v.

Perenco had to additionally demonstrate, and Ecuador contended it accepts this burden in its written pleadings, that the breach had the effect of essentially depriving the investor of the benefits of the Contracts.1028 To succeed on a claim of \"indirect expropriation\", the investor must prove that the measure, or a series of measures, has effectively and permanently deprived it of \"the economic use, enjoyment or benefits of its investment.\"1029 Ecuador asserted that Perenco failed to put forward any credible economic analysis to prove that Law 42 had such an effect.1030 In this regard, Ecuador pointed to evidence that it submitted countered any suggestion that Law 42 caused a near-total loss of value or control of Perenco\u2019s rights under the Contracts:\n\n(i) The first was Perenco\u2019s offer to place monies into escrow in June 2008 (six months after the enactment of Decree 662 and the application of Law 42 at the 99% rate). It was Perenco\u2019s own position at the time that its \"operations in Ecuador *generated enough cash to deposit the amounts due under Law 42 into an escrow account* and still *continue to operate the Blocks. \"1031*\n\n(ii) The second was Perenco\u2019s failure to \"put forward any clear and compelling evidence of what effects Law 42 had, in practice, on its investment.\"1032 Ecuador disputed the probative value of Mr. d\u2019Argentr\u00e9\u2019s evidence and the economic analyses appended in table-form in Exhibits CE-116 and CE-117 to his witness statement because \"(i) they do not even indicate the source for the figures mentioned therein and (ii) they are unsupported by any independent economic analysis.\"1033\n\n(iii) The third was the economic analysis produced by Perenco at Exhibit CE-116, which purportedly demonstrated the effect of Law 42 at 99% in 2008 and suggested that Perenco suffered a loss for the first time in 2008 when it should have earned a profit of US $127,975,000. This conceded that \"when Law 42 was applied at a 50% rate, Law 42 did not devastate Perenco\u2019s investment.\"1034\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 579, referring to Revised Memorial, paragraph 191.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 586.

Reply, paragraphs 368-370: Perenco argued that it did not offer to place into escrow *past* Law 42 assessments (emphasis of Claimant at paragraph 370 of its Reply), only *\"future* disputed assessments\" [Emphasis in original]. For this reason, Perenco\u2019s offer should not be characterised as an admission that there was \"no economic difference between a scenario in which Ecuador enforced *coactivas* against Perenco and a scenario in which Ecuador complied with the Provisional Measures Decision\" (Reply, paragraph 367; see also, Provisional Measures Decision, paragraph 80). Ecuador responded that Perenco\u2019s counsel in the Provisional Measures hearing made it \"perfectly clear that his client was prepared to put into escrow the entirety of the disputed amounts assessed under Law 42 and Decree 662\", this including \"further escrow of the past accrued disputed payments.\" In this way, Perenco admitted that it was financially able to continue to operate the Blocks under either escrow scenario.

Brattle asserts that by April 2006 when law 42 was introduced, \"Perenco would have expected to have earned an IRR of close to 64%.\" (Brattle, paragraph 64).\n\n662.\n\nEcuador emphasised the significance of the amendment of the Block 7 development plan relating to the Oso field in November 2007 (i.e., more than sixteen months after the enactment of Law 42). (This is discussed above in relation to the claim under Article 4 of the Treaty.) Perenco\u2019s response was that Professor Kalt\u2019s evidence suggested that \"not having the benefit of the upside change[d] the midpoint\",1044 and that the Oso field was \"but one field of many, and not the most expensive at that.\"1045\n\nExpert Report of Joseph P. Kalt, paragraphs 80-82, Figure 7B.\n\nReply, paragraph 374.\n\n663.\n\nEcuador also noted that the 2006 to 2008 Annual Reports of ConocoPhillips (Perenco\u2019s consortium partner\u2019s parent company) recorded no write-down on the book value of its Ecuadorian assets during those years, something it was required to report under US GAAP regulations. Ecuador submitted this suggested that there was no such impairment resulting from the enactment and implementation of Law 42.1046\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 610-612 cf. Reply at paragraph 372.\n\n664.\n\nFinally, Ecuador argued that there can be no permanent deprivation of Perenco\u2019s investment because Law 42 only applied in the event the market price of Ecuadorian crude exceeded the Law 42 reference price. There were periods of time where Law 42 had no effect whatsoever on the Consortium\u2019s profits.1047\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 616-617. For example, Block 7 in January and February 2009, as reflected in the letter sent by Petroecuador at E-139, Letter from Petroecuador to the Consortium dated 16 March 2009, p 1.\n\n665.\n\nEcuador submitted that this evidence was similarly probative when considering whether Law 42 at 99% was expropriatory.1048 It claimed that Perenco for its part again offered no objective evidence to demonstrate that Law 42 at 99% crippled its operations in Ecuador:\n\n[I]t is worth noting that [Perenco] deliberately omitted any economic assessment by an independent economic expert of the impact of Law 42 on the Blocks 7 and 21 Consortium\u2019s overall profitability. Accordingly, because Perenco has failed to sustain its burden of proof, this Arbitral Tribunal need not go any further. It should dismiss Perenco\u2019s claims on this basis alone.1049\n\nRejoinder, section 5.3.3.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 627.\n\n666.\n\nEcuador contended that Perenco could not succeed in its claim that Law 42 at 99% amounted to a permanent deprivation of its benefits under the Contracts1050 because Law 42 applied only above a certain reference price, preserving the returns the Contractor could expect from the base price contemplated in the negotiations up to the Law 42 reference price.1051 The \"test for indirect expropriation as a matter of international law [was] high\", and the \"mere loss of value, which [was] not the result of an interference with the control or use of the investment, [was] not an indirect expropriation. Were it otherwise, every breach of contract which [led] to a loss of value would constitute an expropriation.\"1052\n\nRejoinder, section 5.3.3.

Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award (31 October 2011), paragraph 256, (EL-165).\n\n667.\n\nEcuador argued that it could prove that \"there was neither a total loss of value of Perenco\u2019s investment nor a loss of control over it.\"1053 It relied on the findings of Fair Links and Brattle that \"[t]he operations of Perenco were still generating positive cash flows after the enactment of Law 42 and Decree 662\",1054 Perenco\u2019s offer to place Law 42 monies into escrow,1055 similarly the amendment to the Block 7 development plan relating to the Oso field, and ConocoPhillips\u2019 annual reports for the period 2006 to 2008.1056 In this connection, Ecuador highlighted that the only impairment recorded by ConocoPhillips was in its 10-K form for 2009, a consequence of Perenco\u2019s allegedly unlawful suspension of operations in July 2009.1057 While Perenco submitted that it had no alternative but to suspend operations and leave the Blocks, Ecuador relied on the evidence of Brattle to assert that it was because Perenco was earning \"extraordinary returns off the back of the sustained period of extraordinary and unexpected oil prices\" that it \"ha[d] an incentive to breach the participation contracts if it could make more money in the short term withholding Law 42 and Decree 662 dues than it could expect to make over the long-term through continued production over the remaining life of the Blocks.\"1058\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 542-554.\n\n1st expert Report of fair Links, paragraphs 109-119; 2nd Expert Report of Fair Links, paragraph 47, 54; Expert Report of Brattle, paragraphs 16, 60-91, 109.

The net effect of the price rises and the windfall accumulated pre-April 2006 meant that even when combined with the application of Decree 662 at 99% the Contractor would have expected the Block 7 Contract to generate an IRR of 64% over the life of the Contract. With the full use of hindsight, in July 2012, the built-up windfall and prices actually realized meant that, against the initial modelling, the Contractor even paying Decree 662 dues at 99% would still have generated an IRR of around 63.9%. The position for Block 21, updating the 2000 development plan for actual oil prices and holding the other ex ante assumptions unchanged, was similar. The Contractor looking out in April 2006 when Law 42 came into force, would still have expected an IRR of close to 50%. By October 2007, when Decree 662 came into effect, the pre-April 2006 windfall when combined with increasing prices would still have led a contractor to expect an IRR of 43% on its investment in Block 21 even applying Decree 662 at 99%. By July 2012, looking back with hindsight, and applying the actual prices realized to the ex ante model, a contractor would have been expected to generate an IRR of 43% on Block 21 even if Decree 662 at 99% applied to it.\")\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 546-551.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 629-636.\n\n1st Expert Report of Fair Links, p 41.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 533-540, citing Expert Report of Brattle, paragraphs 93, 99-101, Figures 12-13.\n\n668.\n\nFinally, Ecuador submitted that should the Tribunal find that the measures complained of by Perenco constituted an expropriation of its investment within the meaning of Article 6 of the Treaty, such expropriation was lawful in the circumstances.1059 Law 42 served a public purpose and was necessary.1060 Perenco had not demonstrated that Ecuador\u2019s measures were discriminatory.1061 There had been moreover no violation of \"specific undertakings\" since Ecuador maintained that the Contracts were not breached or modified.1062 It submitted it was not required to pay compensation since this condition in Article 6 was triggered only by an expropriatory action having already taken place and a finding of the same (whether in the form of acceptance by the State or a declaration by an arbitral tribunal).1063\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 649-651.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 623.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 649-651 cf.

The remaining jurisdictional objections*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n669.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections can be dealt with summarily. It will be recalled that Ecuador argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the *coactiva* notices were issued by the *Juzgado de Coactivas de Petroecuador* and the Tribunal has already ruled that it does not have jurisdiction over Petroecuador.1064 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the determination that the Republic, not Petroecuador, was the proper party to the claim does not in any way restrict the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to consider measures taken by Petroecuador in the context of this treaty claim. The *coactivas* were measures taken to enforce Law 42 and are attributable to the State for the purposes of international responsibility. Distinctions between different agencies of the Ecuadorian State which may be relevant to a contract claim governed by Ecuadorian law may not be relevant when it comes to an international law claim based on a treaty. The Tribunal considers that this is such a case and that it therefore has jurisdiction to consider the *coactivas\u2019* consistency with the Treaty. The objection is dismissed.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 444, fn. 372, citing Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 242.3. Cf. Reply, paragraph 346.\n\n670.\n\nAs for Ecuador\u2019s objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to consider that part of Perenco\u2019s case which extends to claiming that the *caducidad* decrees \"completed\" the expropriation of Perenco\u2019s rights and property (or, alternatively, the objection to the admissibility of the same), the Tribunal considers that the initiation of the *caducidad* proceedings and the ultimate declarations made by the Ministry are likewise attributable to the State. The fact that the Block 7 Contract excluded the arbitrability of *caducidad* under that Contract cannot preclude the Tribunal from considering the declaration\u2019s consistency with Ecuador\u2019s obligations under the Treaty. This objection is also dismissed.\n\n*b. Law 42 at 50%*\n------------------\n\n671.\n\nIt appears that although the Claimant saw Law 42 at 50% as the first of a series of measures that culminated in the expropriation of the investment, it did not press the point that at 50% Law 42 was itself an expropriation.1065 The Tribunal agrees that at 50%, Law 42 did not constitute a deprivation within the meaning of Article 6.\n\nReply, paragraph 356: \"At 50%, Law 42 constituted a breach of the Participation Contracts and of the fair and equitable treatment and non-impairment standards under the Treaty...At 99%, it was also economically devastating to Perenco, and, contrary to Ecuador\u2019s contention, constituted an expropriation in and of itself.\"\n\n672.\n\nWhile like any other windfall tax, Law 42 reduced Perenco\u2019s profitability, it did not deprive the Claimant of its rights of management and control over the investment in Ecuador, nor did it reach the requisite level of a substantial diminution in the value of that investment. The Tribunal is mindful in this regard of the point made in a number of awards that a distinction is to be drawn between a partial deprivation of value, which is not an expropriation, and a *\"complete or near complete deprivation of value\",* which can constitute an expropriation.1066 Thus, for example, in *Tecmed v. Mexico,* the tribunal adverted to measures that *\"radically deprived* [the investor] of the economical use and enjoyment of its investments, *as if the rights related thereto... had ceased to exist\"* or, to put it another way, \"the assets involved have lost their value or economic use for their holder.1067 In *CME v. Czech Republic,* the tribunal noted that an indirect expropriation can arise where there are measures that do not involve an overt taking but that *effectively neutralize the benefit* of the property of the foreign owner\u2026\"1068.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award (20 August 2007), paragraph 7.5.11.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award (29 May 2003), paragraph 115 [Emphasis added].\n\n*CME Czech Republic, B.V. (the Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL Partial Award (13 September 2001), paragraph 604 [Emphasis added].\n\n673.\n\nThese formulations as to the amount of deprivation of value required to be shown before an indirect expropriation will be found to exist tend in the direction of positing a very substantial amount of deprivation. It need not be complete, but it must be very substantial. The point was also made by the tribunal in *EnCana v. Ecuador,* where the tribunal found that a denial of VAT refunds did not amount to an indirect expropriation because there was no evidence to suggest that the measure \"brought the companies to a standstill or rendered the value to be derived from their activities so marginal or unprofitable as effectively to deprive them of their character as investments.\"1069\n\n*EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case No. UN 3481, Award (3 February 2006), paragraph 174.\n\n674.\n\nUsing the standards employed in prior cases, it is plain that Law 42 at 50% did not substantially deprive the Claimant of its investment, or effectively neutralise the benefit of the investment or rights related thereto, nor did it render Perenco\u2019s activities so marginal or unprofitable as to effectively deprive them of their character as investments. Reference to, for example, the Consortium\u2019s tax returns for 2006 and its Oso Development Plan, discussed previously, demonstrates this clearly.\n\n*c. Law 42 at 99%*\n------------------\n\n675.\n\nWith respect to Decree 662, it is to be noted that other than the claim to 99% of the \"extraordinary revenues\" - which the Tribunal has already found to be a breach of Article 4 -the State did not attempt to interfere with the normal attributes of management and control over the investment. This part of the claim turns entirely on the question of whether the State\u2019s demand of payment of 99% of the \"extraordinary revenues\" amounted to such a substantial diminution of Perenco\u2019s investment such as to amount to an indirect expropriation.\n\n676.\n\nPerenco argued that it plainly was; taking away 99% of the Contracts\u2019 upside benefits amounted to an indirect expropriation of its investment, even if it retained the ability to generate income at and below the reference price, and otherwise continue to operate the business. Ecuador looked at it from the other end of the telescope: since Decree 662 applied only above the reference price for each Contract, there could be no finding of expropriation because the revenues generated by sales up to the reference price were broadly what the parties expected would be generated when the Contracts were entered into, and there was no interference with the management and control of the business.\n\n677.\n\nThe Tribunal has already rejected Ecuador\u2019s contention that Perenco\u2019s contractual expectations were satisfied by its obtaining the kind of revenues that were anticipated at the time of contracting. This goes against the very notion of a participation contract and fails to accord sufficient weight to Perenco\u2019s assumption of risk. That said, there is merit in Ecuador\u2019s argument that Decree 662 did not interfere with the management and control of the business.\n\n678.\n\nAs for Decree 662\u2019s impact on Perenco\u2019s operations, Ecuador referred to the evidence of its expert, Fair Links. Figure 14 in Fair Links\u2019 first Report, which charted Block 21\u2019s historical free cash flow1070 analysis, suggested that both the cumulative and annual free cash flow of the Consortium should have remained steadily positive throughout the enactment and implementation of Law 42 and Decree 662.1071 Figure 15 charted the historical cash flow analysis for Block 7, and similarly posited a steady increase of the annual and cumulative free cash flow that the Consortium should have had the benefit of during that time.1072 Fair Links found that for both Blocks \"the most significant annual cash contributions over the life of the [Blocks] [were] either in 2007 (Block 21) or 2008 (Block 7), i.e., when Law 42 then Decree 662 were fully applicable.\"1073 It is pertinent to note that the charts recorded a dip in the annual free cash flow for Block 21 in 2008 as compared to 2007 (though it remained positive).1074 The same cannot be said for the amount of annual free cash flow in Block 7; Figure 15 recorded a rise in 2008 (though not as significant as the increase in positive free cash flow from 2006 to 2007 in Block 7).1075\n\nThe term \u2018free cash flow\u2019 is defined by Fair Links as \"the cash that company is able to generate after spending the resources required to maintain or expand its asset base (free cash flows are calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures)\": 1st Expert Report of Fair Links, p 39, paragraph 109.\n\n1st Expert Report of Fair Links, Figure 14, p 40.\n\n1st Expert Report of Fair Links, Figure 15, p 40.\n\n1st Expert Report of Fair Links, p 3 9, paragraph 111.\n\n1st Expert Report of Fair Links, Figure 14.\n\n1st Expert Report of Fair Links, Figure 15, p 40.\n\n679.\n\nThe evidence of Perenco\u2019s expert, Professor Kalt, was that the effect of Law 42 and Decree 662 should be considered from the perspective of \"field viability\", i.e., the balance between the revenues associated with operating the field as weighed against the capital costs already incurred and the operational costs associated with continuing production. Perenco made significant investments in Blocks 7 and 21 after it bought its interest in 2002, totaling approximately US $364 million.1076 The effect of the tax at 99% could not be weighed solely against the current operating costs of the contractor but additionally had to account for sunk capital costs.1077 He responded to Fair Link\u2019s evidence that the Consortium continued to generate positive annual free cash under Decree 662 by challenging whether the margin was \"\u2018reasonable\u2019 and/or \u2018enough\u2019...to make it rational for Perenco to continue to operate under\" the Participation Contracts from the contractor\u2019s perspective, i.e., a perspective of field viability, and submitting that the \"economic character\" of Contracts under Decree 662 had taken on the \"most extreme form of government participation - i.e., a service contract.\"1078 He further contended that \"Fair Links\u2019 own \u2018free cash\u2019 analysis implicitly recognize[d] [that under Decree 662] Perenco was effectively only able to recover expenses and was not even afforded recovery of past or going-forward capital related costs (including a return on capital).\"1079 In this regard, Figure 17 of his report opined that under Decree 662 and before *coactivas* were issued, Perenco would have reported a loss of net income from combined Block 7 and 21 operations of US $60.6 million, when it should have earned a projected profit of US $272 million (in the absence of Law 42).1080\n\nExpert Report of Joseph P.

The Tribunal \u2019s Decision*\n-----------------------------\n\n680.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, although it contravened Article 4 of the Treaty for the reasons previously explained, Decree 662 did not amount to an indirect expropriation. The Tribunal\u2019s reasons are threefold.\n\n681.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal recalls Perenco\u2019s expectations of relatively stable oil prices at the time of the acquisition of its interests in the Contracts. As Mr. Spink testified, at US $20/barrel, Perenco considered that it could achieve a return on its investment in a relatively short period of time. Subject to what the Tribunal has to say about the impact of the *coactivas* on the Consortium\u2019s cashflow, which is dealt with separately below, if this was so prior to Decree 662, it remained the case thereafter. Perenco continued to operate the Blocks and there was no impairment of any rights of ownership or control.\n\n682.\n\nAt paragraph 672 above, the Tribunal referred to three cases in which other tribunals focused on whether the effect of the alleged exproriatory measures came close to extinguishing the investor\u2019s business. To these can be added other cases. In *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America,* the tribunal found that a measure was not expropriatory when it did not cause a \"complete or very substantial deprivation of owners\u2019 rights in the totality of the investment\" and the claimant remained in possession of an \"ongoing business\".1081 It made these remarks with regard to Article 1110 of the NAFTA, highlighting several decisions which bear some resemblance to the facts of the present case:\n\n148. Other NAFTA tribunals have regularly construed Article 1110 to require a complete or very substantial deprivation of owners' rights in the totality of the investment, and have rejected expropriation claims where (as here) a claimant remained in possession of an ongoing business. The *Pope & Talbot* Interim Award rejected a claim that the disputed measures interfered with the claimants\u2019 business sufficiently to constitute an expropriation, where the claimant continued to make profitable exports of logs. As the *S.D. Myers* tribunal explained, \u2018[a]n expropriation usually amounts to a lasting removal of the ability of an owner to make use of its economic rights.\u2019\n\n149. The tribunal in *Feldman v. Mexico* rejected a claim of expropriation where the claimant remained in possession and able to conduct other lines of business.\n\n\u2018[H]ere, as in *Pope & Talbot,* the regulatory action (enforcement of longstanding provisions of Mexican law) has not deprived the Claimant of control of the investment, CEMSA, interfered directly in the internal operations of CEMSA or displaced the Claimant as the controlling shareholder. The Claimant is free to pursue other continuing lines of export trading, such as exporting alcoholic beverages, photographic supplies, or other products... although he is effectively precluded from exporting cigarettes. Thus, this Tribunal believes there has been no \"taking\" under this standard articulated in *Pope & Talbot,* in the present case.\u2019\n\n150. *Glamis Gold* is to similar effect.\n\n\u2018[A] panel\u2019s analysis should begin with determining whether the economic impact of the complained of measures is sufficient to potentially constitute a taking at all: \u2018 [I]t must first be determined if the Claimant was radically deprived of the economical use and enjoyment of its investments, as if the rights related thereto... had ceased to exist.\u2019 The Tribunal agrees with these statements and thus begins its analysis of whether a violation of Article 1110 of the NAFTA has occurred by determining whether the federal and California measures \"substantially impaired] the investor\u2019s economic rights, i.e. ownership, use, enjoyment or management of the business, by rendering them useless. Mere restrictions on the property rights do not constitute takings.\u20191082\n\n*Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award (12 January 2011), paragraph 148.\n\n*Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award (12 January 2011), paragraphs 149-150 [Internal citations omitted].\n\n683.\n\nThe *Grand River* tribunal added that this was consistent with the approach of non-NAFTA tribunals who have \"held that an expropriation requires very great loss or impairment of all of a claimant\u2019s investment\":\n\n151....ICISD tribunals have rejected expropriation claims involving significant diminution of the value of a claimant\u2019s property where the claimant nevertheless retained ownership and control. Thus, the Tribunal in *CMS v. Argentina* rejected a claim of expropriation where the claimant retained full ownership and control of the investment, even though its value was reduced by more than 90%. *LG&E* v. *Argentina* is similar: \u2018Interference with the investment\u2019s ability to carry on its business is not satisfied where the investment continues to operate, even if profits are diminished.\u20191083\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 151.\n\n684.\n\nHaving regard to the strict tests posited by the foregoing cases, the Tribunal considers that although Decree 662 breached the fair and equitable treatment standard, it did not amount to an indirect expropriation. It came close to, but did not cross the line.\n\n685.\n\nSecond, throughout the period following the application of Decree 662 and until the suspension of operations in July 2009, Perenco continued to operate the fields and either paid Law 42 dues at 99% (until it submitted the claim to ICSID arbitration following the President\u2019s suspension of the negotiations in April 2008) or thereafter deposited the disputed amounts into a bank account located outside of Ecuador. Even after the arbitration started in earnest, Perenco stated its willingness to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s suggestion that the Parties agree an escrow account arrangement such that future payments of the disputed sums could be set aside pending a decision from the Tribunal on the merits. Thus, the financial burden of paying 99% of the revenues above the reference price, while disadvantageous to Perenco, did not bring its operation to a halt or, to revert to the tests previously cited, effectively neutralise the investment or render it as if it had ceased to exist.1084\n\nAfter the Tribunal had substantially completed its deliberations in this phase of the proceeding, on 28 May 2014, Ecuador filed a letter together with a document that it proposed to put before the Tribunal. The document, that Ecuador sought to have admitted as Exhibit E-376, was an internal ConocoPhillips email exchange entitled \"Drilling Plan Proposal from Ecuador\", dated 9 October 2007. In this document, employees of ConocoPhillips (the parent company of Perenco\u2019s fellow consortium member, Burlington) referred to communications with Perenco after Decree 662 had bene promulgated in which Perenco expressed views as to the economics of proceedings with certain drilling plans in the changed circumstances. By letter dated 14 June 2014, Perenco objected to the admission of the document at this stage of the proceeding. After considering the document and the Parties\u2019 submissons, on 19 June 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that due to the lateness of the request and the requirements of procedural fairness, it would not admit the document to the record. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, given its analysis of the Treaty claims, the document, had it been admitted, would have made no difference to the outcome of this Decision.\n\n686.\n\nThird, throughout 2008 and into 2009, Perenco continued to negotiate with Ecuador with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory adjustment of their relationship. It has already been found that it did so in an atmosphere of coercion, and was seeking to make the best of a worsening situation, and for this reason the Tribunal does not attach much weight to this point, but it does provide some basis for the Tribunal\u2019s view that Decree 662 did not bring the investment to an end.\n\n687.\n\nIn arriving at this conclusion, it need hardly be said that it is obvious that the constraints imposed by Decree 662 made its operating conditions highly sub-optimal for Perenco. The immediate impact of Decree 662 (and subsequent statements from Ecuadorian ministers as to the State\u2019s intention to convert participation contracts into service contracts) likely led to a reduction in investment, increased the demands placed on management, and caused substantial stress to the business generally. But the central focus of the expropriation analysis is not on whether a claimant\u2019s business was optimal, but rather on whether it was effectively taken away from it.\n\n688.\n\nThe Tribunal has focused primarily on the effect of Decree 662 on Perenco. The Claimant made additional arguments going to the legitimacy and proportionality of the decree in terms of its purpose. Indeed, one can reasonably ask whether it was appropriate for the State to claim 99% of the extraordinary revenues and whether this was disproportionate to the State\u2019s public policy objective. As Perenco pointed out, Ecuador had the benefit of \"far less Draconian measures\" as evidenced by the enactment of *Ley de Equidad Tributaria* and its offer of a 70-30 split over higher reference prices than the one Law 42 employed.\n\n689.\n\nThis argument has some merit, but at the end of the day, the Tribunal does not believe that a measure which may be disproportionate tips the balance to a finding of expropriation where the evidence of effect indicates otherwise. The disproportionality point was relevant to the finding that Decree 662 constituted a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, but it does not get the Claimant over the hurdle of proving an indirect expropriation in this case.\n\n690.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal holds that Decree 662 did not effect an indirect expropriation. This, of course, is not the end of the matter. There remains the combined effect of Decree 662, the initiation of the *coactivas,* Ecuador\u2019s decision not to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the suspension of operations and the initiation of *caducidad* proceedings. At the end of the day, Perenco\u2019s contractual rights were formally terminated by the declaration of *caducidad* and the investment in Blocks 7 and 21 was effectively brought to an end as of the date of that declaration.\n\n*e. The combined effect of Decree 662, the* coactivas, *and the declaration of* caducidad\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n691.\n\nEcuador argues that the Consortium pursued a kind of \"self-expropriation\" strategy whereby Perenco and Burlington, having calculated the costs of continuing to operate the Blocks and complying with Law 42 versus surrendering the Blocks, holding onto the monies which they had paid into an account outside the territory of Ecuador, and suing for damages in this arbitration, knowingly took action that would provoke the authorities to intervene and exercise their statutory duties.1085\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 290, 306-311, 533-540.\n\n692.\n\nPerenco rejected the \"self-expropriation\" allegation, noting firstly, that it expressed its willingness to pay the disputed Law 42 sums into escrow during the pendency of the arbitration (specifically future payments that would otherwise be due after the escrow account\u2019s establishment) and secondly, that after the seizures of its production led it to suspend its operations, it offered to resume operations if Ecuador brought itself into compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Provisional Measures.1086 This of course did not occur.\n\nReply, paragraphs 254-266.\n\n693.\n\nThe decision as to whether or not the measures, starting with the *coactivas* and continuing through to the declaration of *caducidad,* amount to an expropriation of Perenco\u2019s investment is not as straightforward as either party suggests.\n\n694.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that Perenco had a reasonable expectation under the Participation Contracts that Ecuador would comply with any decision of the Tribunal. This contractual expectation was buttressed by the general expectation that any disputing party has that once the dispute is submitted to arbitration, both parties will seek to conform their conduct to the Tribunal\u2019s directives, particularly with respect to the non-aggravation of the dispute.\n\n695.\n\nEcuador found itself unable to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Decision in this case. The Tribunal can well understand why in 2009, in applying a domestic law, Ecuador would wish to liquidate the amounts claimed to be owing for 2008. However, when the matter was put before the Tribunal, Ecuador\u2019s duty to enforce the law conflicted with its contractual obligation to comply with decisions of the Tribunal. The Tribunal recommended what it considered to be a reasonable way to protect both Parties\u2019 rights pending a final determination of their dispute. Regrettably, this was not possible in the circumstances. Perenco is correct to point out that had the State stayed its hand in relation to the *coactivas,* the dispute would not have been aggravated in the way in which it was.\n\n696.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore presented with a situation in which the Respondent seized Perenco\u2019s oil production and put it to auction in order to retire the claimed Law 42 debt for 2008. When Perenco (and Burlington) declined to use the monies located outside of Ecuador to pay the claimed debt, it was obvious that Ecuador\u2019s decision to employ the *coactivas* would have a serious impact on the Consortium\u2019s cashflow.\n\n697.\n\nWhen it came to the auctioning of the seized oil, both Parties contributed to the situation. The State held auctions and Perenco, it appears, threatened suit against any person who bought the oil that had been seized from it.1087 As a result, the prices achieved by Petroecuador\u2019s purchasing the oil in the absence of any other bidder were substantially less than the market price. Perenco was in turn credited with a lower value than would have obtained had the oil been sold at market prices. Ecuador bought the production of Blocks 7 and 21 for half and subsequently two-thirds of its market price.1088 It credited these sales against Perenco\u2019s Law 42 debt, but did so at the reduced auction sales price rather than at the market price of the crude.1089\n\nExhibit E-57, \"Perenco Will Protect Its Rights in Ecuadorian Oil Seized in Defiance of International Arbitration Tribunal Orders,\" PR Newswire, London, 3 July 2009; Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 2, p 316 (Opening Statement of Respondent).\n\nReply, paragraph 356; Exhibits E-92 (table of auctions of Block 7 crude) cf.

Thus, in reality, by 2009 Perenco could not have had positive free cash flow since it was receiving no cash inflows from sales of oil. At the same time, it continue[d] to incur significant out of pocket costs to continue operating the field and to transport the production to the market place. In such circumstances, net free cash flow ha[d] to be negative, not positive as claimed by Fair Links.\"1095 For example, for Block 7 in 2009, Professor Kalt submitted that instead of free cash flow of US $32 million, the Consortium would have suffered a loss of US $66 million as a result of Law 42, Decree 662 and the *coactivas.1096*\n\nRejoinder, section 5.3.2; Brattle, paragraph 93.\n\n1st Expert Report of Fair Links, pp 39-40.\n\nExpert Report of Joseph P.

Kalt, Figure 19, p 80.\n\n700.\n\nIn its second report, Fair Links responded to Professor Kalt\u2019s points, contending that the \"impact of the *Coactivas* procedures is different to an assessment of Law 42 (including Decree 662) in 2009.\"1097 In its First Report, Fair Links concluded that, assuming that Perenco paid its Decree 662 dues for 2008, it should have nevertheless benefited from a \"compound surplus (free cash flow) of more than $8/bbl\".1098 Fair Links argued in this regard that Decree 662 and the *coactivas* were two separate measures, and to add them would be to \"distort the impact of Law 42.\"1099 It clarified its meaning in the course of the report, explaining that since the *coactiva* procedures were meant to enforce Law 42, to request what should have been paid under Law 42, its design was not to impose \"an additional burden beyond Law 42\" but to collect \"sums that Perenco already received as revenues in 2008 but had withheld.\"1100 It challenged Professor Kalt\u2019s analysis as \"distorted by the impact of the discounts from the actual auction procedures\", stating that since it had been \"instructed that these discounts resulted from Perenco\u2019s own actions to hamper the auction process rather than from *Coactivas \u2019s* (sic) legal procedures\", its approach was that the \"impact of *Coactivas* should be assessed independently from discounts that were caused by Perenco itself.\"1101\n\n2nd Expert Report of Fair Links, paragraphs 55, p 21.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 48, p 19.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 55, p 21.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 57, p 21.\n\n2nd Expert Report of Fair Links, paragraph 58, p 21.\n\n701.\n\nEcuador\u2019s second expert, the Brattle Group, took a different tack and responded by extrapolating from the Annex V and development models Professor Kalt employed before concluding that \"[i]f we isolated] the impact of the auction results...the evidence appeal[ed] entirely consistent with [its] analysis of the consortium\u2019s financial incentives in April 2008, namely that potentially greater value could be had for the consortium by withholding Law 42 and Decree 662 dues over the short-term than could be gained through paying the dues and operating the fields until the scheduled end of the contracts.\"1102 Figures 12 and 13 of the Brattle report suggest that in August 2008, when oil market prices hit a peak,1103 the cumulative value of Law 42 dues began to exceed the continuation value of operations to the Consortium. Ecuador emphasised repeatedly that Law 42 and Decree 662 only applied to revenues above statutory reference prices beyond the *ex ante* price assumptions of the parties.1104 Brattle\u2019s evidence is that since neither Law 42 nor Decree 662 reduced the expected price net of taxes below the originally anticipated levels, neither measure reduced the cash flows, internal rate of return or net present value of the financial models for Block 7 and 21 below the original estimates.1105 Indeed, \"the cash flows, internal rate of return or net present value of these financial models were all much greater than the original estimates.\"1106\n\nExpert Report of Brattle, paragraph 24.\n\n2nd Expert Report of Fair Links, Figure 7.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 185, 419; Rejoinder, paragraph 8, 523 etc.\n\nExpert Report of Brattle, paragraphs 9-11.\n\nExpert Report of Brattle, paragraph 12.\n\n702.\n\nEcuador made the further point that Law 42 and Decree 662 came into effect after oil prices had already begin to rise; in other words they did not \"deprive Perenco of the massive windfalls it had already generated in a period of skyrocketing oil prices before 2006.\"1107 The suggestion is that this should be accounted for in any analysis of whether the IRR of 15% was being met over time (i.e., challenging Professor Kalt\u2019s IRR of 13% as ignoring the upsides that Perenco had already received).1108\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 525-527.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 526-527 cf. Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt, paragraphs 106-108, Figure 10.\n\n703.\n\nIn the end, the narrow question for the Tribunal is whether Perenco, having sought the aid of the Tribunal, could then take comfort that its refusal to pay the 2008 Law 42 dues to Ecuador would protect it in this arbitration without any potentially adverse consequences. The Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties\u2019 positions. It considers that Perenco had a right to expect that Ecuador would desist from enforcing the *coactivas* during the pendency of the arbitration. It also considers that in deciding to withhold all Law 42 amounts claimed in 2008, Perenco assumed that the Tribunal would accept its claims that none of the Law 42 dues claimed by the State were permissible under the Contracts or the Treaty. Given that Perenco has not made out its claims in respect of Law 42 at 50%, the Tribunal holds that even though Ecuador should have complied with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the *coactivas* ought not to be included in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the measures said collectively to constitute an indirect expropriation. (Quite apart from the expropriation issue, the Tribunal considers that Petroecuador\u2019s decision to credit the Consortium\u2019s tax debt with only the price received in the auction was unfair and inequitable. It can be safely assumed that Petroecuador would have sold the oil at the market price and by crediting Perenco with the depressed auction price instead of the prevailing market price, it would plainly take longer for the seizures to pay down the debt claimed to be owing. In addition, to the extent that Perenco has succeeded in its claim that the application of Decree 662 at 99% violated Article 4 of the Treaty, as found at paragraphs 606-607 above, the enforcement of the *coactivas* to collect the claimed additional 49% constituted a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, but it was not an expropriation of the investment.)\n\n*f The suspension of operations and the State \u2019s response thereto*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n704.\n\nThis takes the Tribunal to the suspension of operations which can be addressed summarily. Perenco argued that the State\u2019s decision to intervene and operate the blocks after it decided to suspend operations amounted to an expropriatory act. While the Tribunal has accepted that the defence of *exceptio non adempleti contractus* was available to Perenco under Ecuadorian law, and therefore it could lawfully suspend operations when faced with a breach of contract without itself being found to be in breach, this does not dictate the conclusion that when faced with suspension of operations, the State was powerless to intervene and that any such intervention constituted an expropriation.\n\n705.\n\nHere the Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s argument that when the Consortium announced its intention to suspend operations, there were good and valid reasons for the State to intervene in order to operate the Blocks, thereby ensuring their continuity and maintaining their productivity.1109 The Respondent has demonstrated the potential production losses and other technical problems that could have ensued had operations been suspended. The Tribunal therefore accepts that the State had the right to operate and maintain the Blocks after the Consortium withdrew.1110 This intervention - which cannot be said to have interfered with the Consortium\u2019s rights of management and control over the Blocks because the Consortium had voluntarily surrendered such rights on a temporary basis - did not amount to an expropriation and cannot be counted towards one.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 313-317, 614-617.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 614-617; 2ndExpert Report of PRS, paragraphs 7-8.\n\n*g. The declaration of* caducidad\n---------------------------------\n\n706.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Respondent\u2019s decision to initiate *caducidad* proceedings.1111 This too can be dealt with summarily. While it accepts that the State had the right to intervene and operate the blocks, the Tribunal does not accept that the State was bound to bring the Claimant\u2019s contracts to an end by means of a *caducidad* declaration. The Tribunal notes in this regard that under Chapter IX of the Hydrocarbons Law, Article 74, the Ministry *\"may* declare the *caducidad* of contracts, if the contractor\" engages in any of thirteen different types of acts including suspending operations \"without cause justifying it, as determined by PETROECUADOR.\"1112 The Tribunal attaches particular importance to the fact that the opening phrase of Article 74 is expressed in permissive rather than mandatory terms. That is, the Ministry is empowered to declare the caducity of contracts in any of the specified circumstances, but it is not obliged to do so.\n\nRej oinder, paragraphs 611-623.\n\nExhibit EL-90 Unofficial translation of Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law [Emphasis added.].\n\n707.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Ecuador\u2019s submission that this was not done without fair warning to the Consortium.1113 The Ministry and Petroecuador wrote to the Consortium on four occasions requesting it to resume operations and warned that a failure to do so could lead to the termination of their Contracts.1114\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 312.\n\nExhibits E-132/CE-236, Letter from Petroecuador to Perenco regarding suspension of operations, 21 July 2009 (in Spanish with English translation); E-107, Letter from Petroecuador to Perenco and Burlington dated 24 July 2009; E-133/CE-239, Letter from Petroecuador to Perenco requesting Perenco to resume operations, 18 August 12009; E-124, Letter from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum to Perenco dated 19 August 2009.\n\n708.\n\nBut in all the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal considers that the Ministry should have stayed its hand and awaited the outcome of this arbitration. It was not contrary to Article 6 for Ecuador to have continued to operate the oilfields in the face of the Claimant\u2019s refusal to return until the *coactiva* matter had been addressed to its satisfaction. But the decision to initiate caducity proceedings and thereby bring Perenco\u2019s contractual rights to an end during the midst of this arbitration leads the Tribunal to find a breach of Article 6.\n\n709.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that when Ecuador first indicated its inability to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures, it stated that it had no intention to terminate the Participation Contracts:\n\n...Nevertheless, Ecuador is committed to furthering the central goal of the Decision, namely to avoid any actions that would undermine the effectiveness of any potential award that might be issued (should the Tribunal ultimately affirm its jurisdiction and proceed to the merits). *To that end, Ecuador intends to carry out the enforcement of Law 42 in such a way as to avoid any disruption of Perenco \u2019s business. In particular, Ecuador does not intend to seize any assets of the Consortium beyond oil equivalent in value to the outstanding debt. Nor does* *Ecuador intend to terminate the relevant Participation Contracts, or take legal action against Perenco representatives,\"1115*\n\nExhibit CE-212, Letter from Respondents regarding the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures and Law 42, 15 May 2009 [Emphasis added.].\n\n710.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises that this statement of intention was made prior to the Consortium\u2019s suspension of its operations and the ensuing correspondence between the Parties. Be that as it may, the Ministry had the discretion not to commence *caducidad* proceedings and it is the Tribunal\u2019s judgment that this discretion should have been exercised in favour of not pursuing *caducidad* while the Parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations were being determined in this proceeding. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that as of the date of *caducidad* having been declared and the Consortium\u2019s interests were finally brought to an end, the Respondent effected an expropriation of Perenco\u2019s contractual rights contrary to Article 6 of the Treaty. This is the date of the expropriation; for the reasons given above, the Tribunal rejects the creeping expropriation argument advanced by Perenco.\n\n711.\n\nThis declaration of caducity was for the same reason equally a breach of the Block 21 Contract because, having occupied the blocks in order to safeguard the oilfields, it was unnecessary for the Ministry to then bring the Contract to an end.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n712.\n\nThe issue of costs is reserved for the final award.\n\n**X. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n713.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over all breach of contract claims as technical and/or economic disputes with the exception of the claim regarding the declaration of *caducidad* in respect of the Block 7 Contract. This falls outside of the Tribunal\u2019s contractual jurisdiction.\n\n(2) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims of breach of Treaty.\n\n(3) The claim of breach of contract in respect of Law 42 at 50% is rejected.\n\n(4) The claim of breach of contract in respect of Law 42 at 99% is upheld.\n\n(5) The claim of breach of the Block 7 Contract in respect of alleged discriminatory treatment of Perenco in comparison to Andes Petroleum is rejected.\n\n(6) The claim of breach of the Block 21 Contract as a result of the declaration of *caducidad* is upheld.\n\n(7) The claim of breach of Article 4 of the Treaty in respect of Law 42 at 50% is rejected.\n\n(8) The claim of breach of Article 4 of the Treaty in respect of Law 42 at 99% is upheld.\n\n(9) The claim that Decree 662 constituted a breach of Article 6 of the Treaty is rejected.\n\n(10) The claim that the enforcement of the *coactivas* constituted a breach of Article 6 of the Treaty is rejected.\n\n(11) The claim that the Respondent\u2019s intervention in Blocks 7 and 21 in order to operate the oilfields after the Consortium suspended operations constituted a breach of Article 6 of the Treaty is rejected.\n\n(12) The claim that the declaration of *caducidad* constituted a breach of Article 6 of the Treaty is upheld.\n\n(13) Since the Respondent has brought a counterclaim which has already been the subject of pleadings and a hearing, the Tribunal is not in a position to consider granting the relief sought by the Claimant at paragraph 511 of its Reply, namely, a declaration that Perenco has no further obligation of any kind, to Ecuador, Petroecuador or any other Ecuadorian department or instrumentality, whether under the Participation Contracts or otherwise, with respect to Blocks 7 and 21; and\n\n(14) Having found the Respondent to be in breach of the Participation Contracts and the Treaty, it is necessary to move to the damages phase of this arbitration. The Tribunal will lay down a briefing schedule as well as propose dates for a hearing on damages for the parties\u2019 consideration."}, {"Title": "Decision on Ecuador's Reconsideration Motion", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2015-04-10T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Ecuador's Reconsideration Motion\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\nA. Procedural History\n---------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 12 September 2014, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability (the \"**Decision**\").1\n\n2.\n\nBy letters dated 22 October and 7 November 2014, Ecuador indicated its intent to submit a Motion for Reconsideration (the \"**Motion**\") of the Decision. By letters dated 29 October and 11 November 2014, Perenco opposed any such motion, arguing that the Decision had decided the issues in dispute addressed within it and that the Tribunal lacked any power under the ICSID Convention to reopen what it had previously decided.\n\n3.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 11 dated 14 November 2014, the Tribunal allowed Ecuador's request for leave to file a Motion for Reconsideration, subject to the following:\n\na) Ecuador's Motion was to be filed no later than 15 December 2014;\n\nb) The Tribunal would not, at that stage, fix a subsequent briefing schedule on the Motion;\n\nc) The Tribunal emphasised that it had already issued a reasoned Decision; that under the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules no appeal is provided for, and that only in exceptional circumstances would it be open for the Tribunal to reconsider its prior reasoned decisions;\n\nd) Ecuador was directed to focus its Motion on the existence of those exceptional circumstances which would justify the reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision.\n\n4.\n\nBy agreement of the Parties, notified to the Tribunal on 11 December 2014, the deadline for the filing of Ecuador's Motion for Reconsideration was extended to 19 December 2014. Ecuador duly submitted its Motion on 19 December 2014, accompanied by the fifth Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade and its annexes, 1 factual exhibit (E-376) and 60 legal authorities (EL-204 to EL-264).\n\nB. Summary of the Motion\n------------------------\n\n5.\n\nIn its Motion, Ecuador submits that the Tribunal has the power to reopen and amend its Decision and that it must exercise this power in the present case because of the \"repeated instances of the [Tribunal's] omitting to determine issues put to it, violating fundamental rules of procedure, manifestly exceeding its powers and failing to state the reasons on which the [Decision] is based.\"1 In its view, this renders the Tribunal's findings as to its jurisdiction over the treaty and contract claims, and its findings as to Ecuador's breaches of the Participation Contracts and of the Treaty \"fundamentally and fatally flawed.\"2 It seeks from the Tribunal a decision amending the Decision's findings on jurisdiction and the merits, and an order bifurcating the Motion and staying the Quantum phase of the arbitration during the pendency of the Tribunal's consideration of its application.3\n\nMotion for Reconsideration (hereinafter \"Motion\"), para 3.\n\nMotion, para 3\n\nMotion, paras 2-3, 295-298.\n\n6.\n\nAt paragraph 3(c) and (d) of Procedural Order No. 11, the Tribunal noted that \"only in exceptional circumstances would it be open for the Tribunal to reconsider its prior reasoned decisions\" and it accordingly directed Ecuador to focus its Motion \"on the existence of those exceptional circumstances which would justify reconsideration\" of the Decision. Ecuador submits that those \"exceptional circumstances\" exist where it can establish any of the grounds for reversal found in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules or when it is otherwise in the interests of justice.4 Ecuador submits that in each instance under the Convention and Rules, \"the power to reopen and amend and/or reverse an extant decision is exercised exceptionally.\"5\n\nMotion, paras 14-15. At para 14, Ecuador states: \"The Arbitral Tribunal therefore requested in Procedural Order No. 11 that Ecuador focus this Motion on the existence of those 'exceptional circumstances' which would justify the reconsideration of the [Decision].\"\n\nMotion, para 15 [Italics in original, underlining emphasis added].\n\n7.\n\nEcuador submits further that, contrary to the majority's holding in *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* in a similar request for reconsideration, decisions preceding what Ecuador calls a \"Convention award\" do not have *res judicata* effect and the legal consequences that ensue from such status.6 It cites in support of this position a statement made by Professor Schreuer with respect to Article 51 of the Convention, which addresses a tribunal's power of revision, and where he states that while the procedure for revision was designed for situations in which the tribunal has terminated its activity and issued a final award, \"[a] tribunal that is still in session can always revise its preliminary decisions informally.\"7\n\nMotion, paras 17-19.\n\nMotion, para 26, referring to C. Schreuer, L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch, A. Sinclair, The ICSID Convention, A Commentary, Cambridge University Press, 2nd Edition, paras 4-5 (EL-199).\n\n8.\n\nAs shall be seen in further detail below, Ecuador also relies upon certain Convention and Arbitration Rules provisions that permit tribunals to take certain steps in relation to their awards as well as the provisions of Article 52 which allow a party to seek the annulment of an award.8 Amongst the grounds of annulment contained in Article 52, the Motion relies principally on three grounds: manifest excess of powers, serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and failure by a tribunal to state the reasons upon which its award is based.9 Ecuador submits in relation to the three grounds that the standard of review that the Tribunal ought to apply to its Motion \"is not the post-award annulment standard\" but a lesser standard that should be applicable to the grounds of review before proceedings are closed:\n\n\"*Pre-award*, the error identified need not be to the heightened '*manifest*', '*gross*', *'egregious'* or *'obvious'* standard. Rather, it is appropriate, and the purposes of the Convention require at this earlier stage, that a showing of any error is sufficient, in order that a tribunal *'achieve its fundamental task of arriving at a correct decision**.\"10* [Underlining added, italics in original.]\n\nMotion, paras 19-60. At para 60, Ecuador asserts: \"[E]ach of the grounds of annulment is an exceptional circumstance justifying the reversal of a Convention award, a remedy reserved for the most serious errors undermining the validity and legitimacy of Convention awards. It must necessarily follow that, upon a showing of such an error prior to the making of a Convention award, a tribunal has the power to reopen, amend and/or reverse a decision preliminary to a Convention award.\"\n\nMotion, paras 29-60.\n\nMotion, paras 109-113 [italics in original], citing *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19), Order in Response to a Petition for Transparency and Participation as *Amicus Curiae*, 19 May 2005, para 11 (EL-257).\n\n9.\n\nIn sum, Ecuador submits that the Tribunal can and ought to reopen and amend and/or reverse the Decision if it establishes that the Motion meets any of the grounds for reopening an Award or reviewing a decision prior to the making of an Award as set out in the Convention and/or the Arbitration Rules or where it is otherwise in the interests of justice to do so.11\n\nMotion, paras 14-113, in particular, paras 98 and 113.\n\n10.\n\nTurning to the findings of the Decision that Ecuador submits should be reconsidered, Ecuador contends in turn:\n\n11.\n\nFirst, that the Tribunal should reconsider its finding of jurisdiction over Perenco's claim that Ecuador breached the Block 21 Participation Contract when it declared *caducidad* because its holding allegedly contradicts its Decision on Jurisdiction and in so doing amounts to a manifest excess of power, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and a failure to satisfy the requirement to state the reasons on which the Decision is based.12\n\nMotion, paras 114-147.\n\n12.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal should reconsider its finding that Perenco was controlled by French nationals at the material time and that the Tribunal accordingly has jurisdiction over Perenco's treaty claims, because it was allegedly arrived at in violation of Ecuador's right to fair and equal treatment, due to the Tribunal's committing a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.13\n\nMotion, paras 148-159.\n\n13.\n\nThird, the Tribunal should reconsider its finding that Ecuador's non-compliance with its prior Decision on Provisional Measures amounted to a breach of contract because the Tribunal allegedly omitted to decide the question of whether its recommendations in that Decision were decisions for the purposes of Clause 22.2.2 of the Participation Contract, failed to state the reasons upon which its finding was based, and its finding contradicts its Decision on Provisional Measures.14\n\nMotion, paras 160-182.\n\n14.\n\nFourth, that the Tribunal should reconsider its interpretation of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* defence as a result of which it found that defence was open to Perenco in order to suspend operations in the Blocks. In this regard, this decision was said to have been arrived at as a result of the Tribunal's having committed a manifest excess of powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and a failure to state the reasons on which the Decision was based.15\n\nMotion, paras 183-204.\n\n15.\n\nFifth, the Tribunal should reconsider its finding that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts because the finding allegedly discloses a manifest excess of powers in the interpretation and application of the *jus variandi* power, is contradictory to the Tribunal's previous finding in the Decision that Law 42 at 50% did not amount to a breach of the Participation Contracts, and that Law 42 at 99% did not amount to an expropriation in breach of the Treaty, and it was arrived at arbitrarily.16\n\nMotion, paras 205-240.\n\n16.\n\nSixth, that the Tribunal should reconsider its finding that the application of Decree 662 to Perenco as well as the ensuing measures breached Article 4 of the Treaty because, in Ecuador's view, Decree 662 did not breach the Participation Contracts, the finding is contradicted by the Tribunal's earlier finding in the Decision that Law 42 at 50% did not amount to a breach of the Treaty, and it was arrived at arbitrarily.17\n\nMotion, paras 241-264.\n\n17.\n\nSeventh, the Tribunal's finding that Ecuador's declaration of *caducidad* breached the Block 21 Participation Contract and affected an expropriation of Perenco's contractual rights should be reconsidered because it allegedly contains a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and was arrived at by the Tribunal having manifestly exceeded its powers.18\n\n**II. The provisions of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules and other authorities invoked by Ecuador**\n\nMotion, paras 265-283.\n\n18.\n\nEcuador refers to the following provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules in support of its Motion. They are listed in the order of their citation by Ecuador:\n\n(i) Article 49(2), which permits a tribunal to, at the request of a party, decide any question which it had omitted to decide in its award or rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award;19\n\n(ii) Article 51, which permits a tribunal to revise its award on the ground of the discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award;20\n\n(iii) Article 52, which permits a party to request the establishment of an *ad hoc* Annulment Committee to seek annulment of an award under one or more of five grounds;21\n\n(iv) Arbitration Rule 38(2), which permits a tribunal, after closure of the proceedings but before the rendering of the award, to reopen the proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points;22\n\n(v) Arbitration Rule 25, which provides that any accidental error in any instrument or supporting document may with the consent of the other party or by leave of the tribunal, be corrected at any time before the award is rendered;23 and\n\n(vi) Article 44, which provides that if any question of procedure arises which is not covered by Section 3 of the Convention and, except as the parties otherwise agree, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect, the tribunal shall decide the question.24\n\nMotion, paras 20-24.\n\nMotion, paras 25-28.\n\nMotion, paras 29-60.\n\nMotion, paras 61-71.\n\nMotion, paras 72-75.\n\nMotion, paras 76-94.\n\n19.\n\nEcuador submits that \"[i]n each case, the power to reopen and amend and/or reverse an extant decision is exercised *exceptionally*, in order to ensure the validity and legitimacy of the ICSID arbitration process and, ultimately, the finality of Convention awards.\"25 Ecuador asserts further that whilst Article 44 provides a \"textual foothold\" for the tribunal's power \"to take measures to preserve the integrity of its proceedings\", as noted by the *Hrvatska* tribunal in its ruling regarding the participation of David Mildon QC in further stages of the proceedings, \"that power is in fact inherent.\"26 Ecuador submits that this \"inherent power most obviously and profoundly manifests itself in an overarching exceptional circumstance in which it is not only appropriate but necessary for a tribunal to reverse its decision: where such action is in the '*interest of justice'*. \"27 Jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights is cited in support of the proposition that even if the applicable convention or court rules do not provide for the reopening of a court's decision, this may be done in the interests of justice.28\n\nMotion, para 15 [Emphasis in original].\n\nMotion, paras 95-98, discussing *Hrvatska Elektroprivreda, d.d. v The Republic of Slovenia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/24, Tribunal's Ruling regarding the participation of David Mildon QC in further stages of the proceedings, 6 May 2008, para 33 (EL-262).\n\nMotion, para 97 [Emphasis in original].\n\n*Storck v. Germany*, ECHR, No. 61603/00, Decision on Admissibility, 26 October 2004, p 14 (EL-203) and *Des Fours Walderode v. The Czech Republic (dec.)*, ECHR, NO. 40057/98, ECHR 2004-V, p 6 (EL-264).\n\n20.\n\nOther cases, in particular *Abaclat v. Argentine Republic* and *Churchill Mining v. Indonesia*, are cited as examples of where tribunals have exercised their powers under Article 44 to tailor the proceeding to special circumstances; in the former case the tribunal was said to have \"used its Article 44 powers in a profoundly important way so as to affect the rights of 60,000 investors and Argentina\"29, and in the latter case the tribunal found that \"Article 44 permitted it to reopen and reverse an earlier procedural order denying bifurcation of a preliminary issue.\"30\n\nMotion, paras 82-85, 89, 92, 94 [Emphasis in original].\n\nMotion, paras 86-89, 92, 94.\n\n21.\n\nFinally, Ecuador attaches particular significance to the \"powerful dissenting opinion\" of Professor Georges Abi-Saab in the case of *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*.31 In that case, the Tribunal was also presented with a request for reconsideration of its earlier decision. The majority denied the request on two bases, the first being that there was no power under the ICSID Convention to entertain such a request and the second being that the findings made by the tribunal in its prior decision were *res judicata*.32 Professor Abi-Saab disagreed.33\n\nMotion, paras 91-92, 99-100.\n\n*ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria**B.V. v.

Thus, according to Ecuador, \"prior to the rendering of a Convention award, provisions such as Rule 25 bestow[s] upon the Arbitral Tribunal the power to permit significant amendments and corrections to the record.\"41 For example, \"[i]ncorrect numbers in documents and discrepancies between two versions of the same document in a dual-language arbitration are situations which may give grounds for correction under Rule 25.\"42\n\n(vi) Article 44 : Article 44 is said to confer \"a wide residual discretion to decide procedural issues not covered by Chapter IV (Arbitration), Section 3 (Powers and Functions of the Tribunal) of the Convention, the Arbitration Rules or any other rules agreed by the parties.\"43 At another point in the Motion it is said that the article confers upon the tribunal \"prior to the closure of proceedings and rendering of a Convention award... the widest possible powers to conduct the arbitration proceedings. \"44\n\nArticle 44's precise relevance to the current Motion lies in Ecuador's submission that: \"... the matter of procedure this Arbitral Tribunal is called on to determine is whether it can, in the absence of an express procedural rule in the Convention or the Rules (or agreement of the Parties), reopen and amend the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and, if so, in what circumstances. Once it has determined that matter of procedure, the Arbitral Tribunal is free to act in accordance with the procedure so determined.\"45\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that the threshold question is \"whether [the Tribunal] can, in the absence of an express procedural rule in the Convention or the Rules (or agreement of the Parties), reopen and amend the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.\" The second question posed by Ecuador in the passage quoted above (\"and, if so, in what circumstances?\") arises only if the first question is answered in the affirmative.\n\nMotion, paras 20-24.\n\nMotion, paras 25-28 [Emphasis in original].\n\nMotion, para 34 [Emphasis in original], more generally, see paras 29-60.\n\nMotion, para 34 [Emphasis in original].\n\nMotion, para 35 [Emphasis in original].\n\nMotion, para 70.\n\nMotion, para 70 [Emphasis in original].\n\nMotion, para 75.\n\nMotion, para 73.\n\nMotion, para 78.\n\nMotion, para 93.\n\nMotion, para 89 [emphasis added].\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that while terms such as \"correction \"46, \"rectification\"47, \"revision\"48 and \"reopen \"49 are employed in the various provisions invoked by Ecuador, what one does not find are terms such as \"reconsider\" or \"reverse\", the terminology used by Ecuador in its Motion.50 In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that Article 53 of the Convention states an award \"shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.\"\n\nArbitration Rule 25.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 49.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 51.\n\nArbitration Rule 38.\n\nFor \"reconsider\", see paras 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 35, 47, 51, 94, 97 *et seq*. For \"reverse\", see paras 11, 15, 60, 71, 93, 97, 101, 102, 104, 105, 109, 165, 206 *et seq*. The term \"reconsider\" is only used in the Arbitration Rules in a specific context in Rule 55: \"If a Committee annuls parts or all of an award, either party may request the resubmission of the dispute to a new Tribunal... If the original award had only been annulled in part, the new Tribunal shall not *reconsider* any portion of the award not so annulled.\" [Emphasis added.] The term \"reverse\" is not used in Chapter IV (Arbitration) of the Convention or in the Arbitration Rules.\n\n25.\n\nHaving set out the various provisions of the Convention and Arbitration Rules and the rationales provided by Ecuador for citing such provisions, the Tribunal will now examine each in turn.\n\n**III. The legal framework governing the Motion**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nIn performing its own review of the provisions cited by Ecuador, the Tribunal will not follow Ecuador's ordering of the provisions, but it will address each in the course of its analysis.\n\nA. Article 52 of the Convention\n-------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with annulment because this figures prominently in the Motion. It is appropriate to begin by differentiating between the powers conferred upon a tribunal as it proceeds through the course of an ICSID arbitration, and the powers conferred on an *ad hoc* Annulment Committee established to review the tribunal's award after it has completed its work.\n\n28.\n\nEcuador has reviewed the findings of various annulment committees to remind the Tribunal of the ways in which annulment committees have treated various transgressions of the grounds of Article 52(1) alleged to have been committed in the Decision.\n\n29.\n\nThe Motion observes that \"the most exceptional circumstances permitting the reopening and amendment and/or reversal of a Convention award\" are the grounds for annulment.51 It draws from an extensive review of annulment committee consideration of the grounds listed in Article 52 that:\n\n\"... each of the grounds of annulment is an exceptional circumstance justifying the reversal of a Convention award, the remedy reserved for the most serious errors undermining the validity and legitimacy of Convention awards. It must necessarily follow that, upon a showing of such an error prior to the making on a Convention award (sic), a tribunal has the power to reopen, amend and/or reverse the decision preliminary to a Convention award.\"52\n\nMotion, para 29.\n\nMotion, para 60.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree that it *necessarily* follows that upon the showing of an error prior to the making of an award, a tribunal has the power to reopen, amend and/or reverse the decision preliminary to the award. To the contrary, a tribunal's power to \"reopen, amend and/or reverse\" must first be shown to exist under the Convention before such power can be exercised and its existence cannot be inferred from the fact that the Convention contains an annulment procedure.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes that although Ecuador has argued that the errors that the Tribunal is said to have committed are so serious as to constitute grounds for annulment, later on in the Motion, Ecuador shifts gears and argues that the \"the standard of review that the Arbitral Tribunal ought to apply when determining whether to re-open and amend and/or reverse one or more of its earlier decisions must necessarily be lower in pre-closing circumstances than the standard of review at the post-award annulment stage (or even in post-closing circumstances).\"53 It argues further that the \"the Convention provides that the earlier in the proceedings a request for reopening is made, the lower the standard of review.\"54\n\nMotion, para 109.\n\nMotion, para 112 [Emphasis added].\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept this argument. It has been told that each of the alleged defects in its Decision is a ground for annulment, yet it is then told that it ought to apply a less rigorous standard for reviewing its own work than an annulment committee would apply. In the Tribunal's view, this is not persuasive. Either a tribunal commits an error which may constitute a ground for annulment, or it does not. On well-established practice and principle, if a tribunal commits some sort of error which falls short of providing a ground for annulment, the award stands (leaving to one side, as discussed below, the tribunal's exercising any power to correct, interpret or revise the award - if the conditions for taking any of those actions are met).\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers that the allocation of roles and responsibilities in the ICSID system means that when deciding a claim, a tribunal should avoid taking on the role of simultaneously acting as if it were an annulment committee sitting in judgement of its own work. As intended by the Convention, the roles are different and must remain separate. Each body must discharge the mandate that it is given pursuant to the Convention and it is in principle wrong to mix the two. Just as many annulment committees have emphasised Article 53's injunction that the award \"shall not be subject to any appeal\" and therefore have refused to enter into a consideration of the correctness of a tribunal's legal reasoning55, a tribunal equally cannot, in a phased arbitration, hold the sword of Damocles above its head and second-guess itself as to whether it has manifestly exceeded its powers, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and so on.\n\nThis is well established. See *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux) v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, (Yves Fortier, President, Professor James Crawford, Professor Jos\u00e9 Carlos Fernandez Rozas, Members), para 62: \"Although the issue of the proper role of an annulment committee in the ICSID system must necessarily inform the analysis and the conclusions of this Committee, relatively little needs to be said about the issue for the reason that there seems to be little disagreement between the parties. Claimants and Respondent agree that an *ad hoc* Committee is not a court of appeal and that its competence extends only to annulment based on one or other of the grounds expressly set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. It also appears to be established that there is no presumption either in favour of or against annulment, a point acknowledged by Claimants as well as Respondent.\" *Patrick Mitchell v.

No one has the slightest doubt - all the *ad hoc* Committees have so stated, and all authors specializing in the ICSID arbitration system agree - that an annulment proceeding is different from an appeal procedure and that it does not entail the carrying out of a substantive review of an award.\" *MTD Equity Sdn.

In other words, it is not contested that \"... an *ad hoc* committee does not have the jurisdiction to review the merits of the original award in any way. The annulment system is designed to safeguard the integrity, not the outcome, of ICSID arbitration proceedings.\" *Wena Hotels LTD. V. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Annulment Proceeding, (Konstantinos D. Kerameus, President, Professor Andreas Bucher and Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, Members), para 18: \"As has been stated in earlier published decisions made on requests for annulment of ICSID awards, the remedy of Article 52 is in no sense an appeal.\"\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the alleged basis for a tribunal power to \"reopen, amend and/or reverse\" is not to be inferred from the existence of an annulment procedure.\n\nB. The other provisions of the Convention and Arbitration Rules\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the other provisions to which Ecuador has referred.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by expressing its view that these provisions, to the extent that they deal with reopening an award (which for present purposes will be assumed to include a decision), do not take Ecuador's Motion very far. The real issue is not whether an award can be rectified to correct a clerical error, for example, but rather whether an award can be *revised* (going so far as to be *reversed*, which is what Ecuador seeks in the present circumstances).56\n\nThe Motion requests reversal of the Decision at paras 15, 60, 71, 86, 93, 97, 101, 102, 104, 105, 109, 165, 206, 211, 236, 243, 248, 249, 260, 285-289, and 291.\n\n37.\n\nThere is a vast difference between *reopening* an award to correct a clerical error or to decide a question which the tribunal omitted to decide and *revising* an award. The grounds are entirely different and in particular, the single ground for revising an award in Article 51 of the Convention is specific and narrowly worded.\n\n(i) Post-award procedures open to a tribunal upon the application of a party\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Convention contains three procedures that permit a party to revert to the tribunal after its award is issued:\n\n(i) the tribunal has the power under Article 49 to, at the request of a party, decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award or to rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error;\n\n(ii) the tribunal has the power to interpret the award under Article 50; and\n\n(iii) the tribunal has the power to revise the award under Article 51 on the ground of discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award.\n\n39.\n\nTwo of these three methods can be put to one side. Ecuador's Motion does not seek an interpretation under Article 50. Ecuador has also acknowledged that Article 51 cannot apply to the present Motion:\n\n\"The Article 51 procedure, as Ecuador has previously pointed out, is not available with respect to decisions preliminary to a Convention award such as the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. Indeed, as Prof. Schreuer expressly points out, the Article 51 procedure is not available with respect to '*decisions on jurisdiction'* and like decisions preliminary to Convention awards\u2014which the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability undoubtedly is.\"57\n\nMotion, para 27, quoting from Schreuer *et al*, paragraphs 4-5 (EL-199).\n\n40.\n\nThis is undoubtedly correct. But in conceding that Article 51 is not available and putting it to one side, Ecuador's Motion tends to obscure a crucial point.\n\n(ii) Article 51 of the Convention\n---------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is important to note that of the three post-award procedures available, the only one that permits a tribunal to *revise* the award is Article 51 and the only ground for engaging in such revision is the \"discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, provided that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant and that the applicant's ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence.\"58\n\nConvention, Article 51(1); see also, Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c)(ii).\n\n42.\n\nThis strongly suggests that once the tribunal has decided the issues before it, its decision becomes *res judicata* and cannot be revised unless a very specific situation which calls out for the tribunal to revisit its prior findings is presented. As shall be seen, the tribunal can take other post-award steps, but when it comes to revision, it can only do so in a single, specific instance.\n\n43.\n\nThere is ample prior authority in support of the view once the tribunal decides with finality any of the factual or legal questions put to it by the parties, as was the case in the Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and Liability, such a decision becomes *res**judicata*.\n\n44.\n\nIn the *CMS Gas Transmission v. Argentine Republic* Award, the tribunal commented:\n\n\"It must also be noted that in connection with the merits the Respondent has again raised certain jurisdictional issues that were addressed in the jurisdictional phase of the case such as the *jus standi* of the Claimant. These issues were decided upon at that stage and will not be reopened in this Award.\"59\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission v. Argentine Republic* Award, para 126 (Professor Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, President, the Honourable Marc Lalonde PC, OC, QC and H.E. Judge Francisco Rezek, Arbitrators).\n\n45.\n\nIn the *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States* (*Waste Management II*) Decision on Mexico's Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings (a case conducted under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules rather than the Convention) the tribunal stated:\n\n\"In cases where the same issue arises at the level of jurisdiction and of merits, it may be appropriate to join the jurisdictional issue to the merits. But at whatever stage of the case it is decided, a decision on a particular point constitutes a *res judicata* as between the parties to that decision if it is a necessary part of the eventual determination and is dealt with as such by the tribunal.\"60\n\n*Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States* (*Waste Management II*), ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Decision on Mexico's Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceeding, para 45. (Professor James Crawford, President, Benjamin R. Civiletti and Eduardo Magall\u00f3n G\u00f3mez, Arbitrators.)\n\n46.\n\nIn the *Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary* Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, the tribunal noted:\n\n\"This Decision is made in regard only to the first phase of these arbitration proceedings, relating to extant issues of jurisdiction and liability; and it is not made in regard to any issue of quantum (including interest). Although necessarily described as a 'Decision' and not an 'Award' under the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules, the several decisions and reasons contained in this Decision are intended by the Tribunal to be final and not to be revisited by the Parties or the Tribunal in any later phase of these arbitration proceedings.\"61\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, (V.V. Veeder, President, Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler and Professor Brigitte Stern, Arbitrators.), para 10.1\n\n47.\n\nFinally, in the *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, the tribunal stated:\n\n\"As noted, the Respondent characterises the Decision as \"interim\" or \"preliminary\" and, accordingly, capable of being reconsidered, perhaps on an informal basis. The only reason suggested in its submissions is the temporal one: a further stage in the proceedings, relating to *quantum*, remains. The Decision does not however take an interim or preliminary form in respect of the matters on which it rules.\"62\n\nAnd:\n\n\"Those decisions in accordance with practice are to be incorporated in the Award. It is established as a matter of principle and practice that such decisions that resolve points in dispute between the Parties have *res judicata* effect. 'They are intended to be final and not to be revisited by the Parties or the Tribunal in any later phase of their arbitration proceedings.'\"63\n\n*ConocoPhillips* Decision, para 20.\n\n*Id*., para 21.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises that Ecuador takes issue with the *ConocoPhillips* decision.64 Nevertheless, with respect to the proposition for which it has just been cited, it fits within a well-established view as to the effect to be given to decisions made during the course of a phased arbitration such as the present one.\n\nMotion, paras 18, 90-92, 99-100.\n\n49.\n\nReverting to Article 51, the Tribunal further notes that the \"decisively affect the award\" test sets a very high standard with respect to the kind of *fact* that could justify reopening the tribunal's prior evaluation of the evidence and the legal conclusions that it reached.\n\n50.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, even if Article 51 were applicable in the present circumstances in temporal terms - which Ecuador concedes is not the case - it could be triggered only by the discovery of a new potentially decisive fact. There is no such fact put before the Tribunal in the present Motion. Indeed, in the Tribunal's view, the seminal facts in this case are not disputed; it is instead their legal consequences on which the parties have disagreed. Even if the Decision were to be equated to an Award, the 5th expert report on Ecuadorian law of Professor Juan Pablo Aguilar submitted with the Motion would not fall within the ambit of Article 51.\n\n51.\n\nAlthough Ecuador has acknowledged Article 51's inapplicability to its Motion,65 the Tribunal has dwelt upon the article because it is the only one available to a tribunal which allows it to revise its award. As shall be seen, procedures other than that provided in Article 51 involve a lesser \"modification\", as it were, of a tribunal's award.\n\nMotion, para 27.\n\n52.\n\nThe fact that Ecuador cannot fit its Motion within the narrow confines of the only article of the Convention that authorises a tribunal to revise its award essentially puts an end to the Motion. However, for purposes of good order, the Tribunal will deal with the balance of the provisions cited by Ecuador.\n\n(iii) Article 49 of the Convention\n----------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nEcuador accepts that Article 49, which deals with the possibility of a tribunal's deciding a question which it omitted to decide in the award or rectifying any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award, is also by its own terms related to the award.\n\n54.\n\nEcuador refers to this article for the proposition that: \"In each case, these are exceptional circumstances which permit the *reopening* of a *res judicata* Convention award\" and argues that if the power can be said to exist in relation to an award, it ought perforce to exist in relation to a decision made prior to an award.66\n\nMotion, paras 24 and 60.\n\n55.\n\nReference to a number of the cases in which Article 49(2) has been invoked shows that tribunals (and in one case an annulment committee) have carefully examined Article 49(2) requests to see whether or not they truly involve a question which was omitted to be decided or deal with a minor clerical error requiring rectification, on the one hand, or, are an attempt by a party to re-argue a point with a view to persuading the tribunal to change its mind, on the other.67\n\nThe inclusion of the word \"similar\" in the phrase \"clerical, arithmetical or similar error\" would, on the *ejusdem generis* rule, not permit the Tribunal to consider a \"similar error\" to be of a different genus than clerical or arithmetical errors. The Motion, at para 23, seems to suggest that the Tribunal has a wider discretion than the Tribunal thinks it has. \"Whilst clerical and arithmetical errors are generally easily identifiable, the reference to a *\"similar error\" \"was intended to permit other corrections that are required to make the Award correspond to the intent of the Tribunal\"* If it is intended to suggest that in the guise of rectifying an error which is not clerical or arithmetical, the Tribunal should revise its legal reasoning, the Tribunal does not agree.\n\n56.\n\nAlthough it was an *ad hoc* Annulment Committee decision, perhaps the best elaboration of the point was made in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* the relevant parts of which the Tribunal quotes as follows:\n\n23. The Argentine Republic also requests the rectification of what it considers to be seven material errors in the Decision. It submits that the scope of the remedy of rectification provided for in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention is well established, as illustrated by recent precedents, and argues that the particular errors affecting the Decision in the present case are so serious that, unless rectified, they could \"nullify the Decision on Annulment\" and prejudice Argentina's position in future ICSID arbitrations. The implication is that, in its deliberations and preparation of the Decision, the Committee disregarded many of the arguments put forward by the Respondent, to its significant detriment.\n\n24. The Claimant, for its part, argues that the seven requests for rectification should be rejected, on the grounds that they exceed the scope of Article 49(2) and, in effect, represent further attempts by the Respondent to reopen debate on issues already decided by the Committee.\n\n25. A review of pertinent arbitral awards illustrates that the availability of the rectification remedy afforded by Article 49(2) depends upon the existence of two factual conditions. First, a clerical, arithmetical or similar error in an award or decision must be found to exist. Second, the requested rectification must concern an aspect of the impugned award or decision that is purely accessory to its merits. Simply stated (and contrary to Respondent's assertion at paragraph 26 of its Request), Article 49(2) does not permit the \"rectification\" of substantive findings made by a tribunal or committee or of the weight or credence accorded by the tribunal or committee to the claims, arguments and evidence presented by the parties. The sole purpose of a rectification is to correct clerical, arithmetical or similar errors, not to reconsider the merits of issues already decided. As will be seen, below, many of the Respondent's requests derive from a misunderstanding of this fundamental principle.\"68\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision of the *Ad Hoc* Committee on the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning Annulment of the Award, 28 May 2003 (Yves Fortier, President, Professor James Crawford, Professor Jos\u00e9 Carlos Fernandez Rozas, Members), paras 23-25 [Emphasis added]. To the same effect, see *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Claimants' Request for Rectification and/or Supplementary Decision of the Award, 25 October 2007 (Professor Francisco Orrego-Vicu\u00f1a, President; Professor Albert Jan van den Berg and Pierre-Yves Tschanz, Arbitrators), para 57, and *Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Decision on Claimant Request for Supplementation and Rectification of the Award, 18 January 2013 (Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, President, Honourable Stuart E. Eizenstat and Professor James Crawford, Arbitrators), para 47.\n\n(iv) Article 49(2) of the Convention, first limb\n------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nSince Article 49 is expressly concerned with reverting to the tribunal after it has rendered its award, strictly speaking it is not applicable to the present Motion. However, the Tribunal will put that aspect of the article's wording to one side and proceed *arguendo* on the basis that the reference to the word \"award\" could encompass a \"decision\" and therefore Article 49 could be triggered at this point in the proceeding. The Tribunal does so because it wishes to explain its conception of its duty to decide the questions presented to it.\n\n58.\n\nSection 5.1 of the Motion is entitled: \"The Arbitral Tribunal's finding that Ecuador's non-compliance with the Provisional Measures amounted to a breach of contract omitted to decide an issue.\"69 The Tribunal observes however that the Convention does not refer to a tribunal's omitting to decide an \"issue\", but rather to its omitting to decide a \"question.\" It seems to the Tribunal that a \"question\" (which is not defined by the Convention) is capable of encompassing one or more issues and an alleged failure to decide an *issue* in the course of deciding a *question* is not what Article 49 is concerned with.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n59.\n\nThe point has been made in a recent annulment committee decision in the course of discussing the Convention's provisions in Article 48 on the contents of an award:\n\n\"Article 48(3) refers to the tribunal's obligation to '*deal with'*'*every question'* submitted to it when rendering an '*award'*. The expression '*every question'* has not been defined by the ICSID Convention. All versions of the ICSID Convention ought to be given the same meaning. When read in conjunction with the Spanish and French versions of the ICSID Convention, it seems without doubt that the words '*every question'* in the English version refer to the heads of claim of the parties ('*las pretensiones'* in the Spanish version, *les chefs de conclusions* in the French version). Article 48(3), therefore, refers to the tribunal's obligation to deal with, either directly or indirectly, all of the parties' *heads of claim* within its award.\"70\n\n*Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, (Eduardo Zuleta, Chairman, Florentino Feliciano and Makhdoom Ali Khan, Members), para 87 [emphasis in original].\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed its Decision and finds it did not omit to decide the various questions identified by Ecuador in its Motion. For example, in relation to Ecuador's complaint concerning whether or not Ecuador's decision not to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures could constitute a breach of the Participation Contracts, in addition to recounting the history of the *coactiva* proceedings (from paragraphs 150 to 179 of the Decision), the question is addressed in the Decision's Findings at paragraphs 412 to 417.71\n\nThe operative paragraph is paragraph 417, which states as follows:  \n\"In the Tribunal's view, a plain reading of clauses 22.2.2 indicates that the contracting parties agreed that they would comply not only with a final award (i.e., in Spanish, the '*laudo*' issued by a tribunal), but in addition, they would observe and comply with the decisions (i.e., in Spanish, the '*decisiones*') of the tribunal. The latter term constitutes a more capacious category of tribunal decisions of which the final award forms a part. Thus, under the Participation Contracts, Ecuador was bound to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures and its failure to do so constitute a breach of contract.\"\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal holds the same view with respect to the other alleged failures to deal with every question submitted to it. Therefore, the Tribunal does not see any basis for the exercise powers under Article 49(2), first limb.\n\n(v) Article 49(2) of the Convention, second limb\n------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nTurning to a tribunal's power to rectify certain types of errors, since the Motion describes certain decisions taken by the Tribunal as being in error, the Tribunal wishes to record its view as to what can permissibly be rectified under Article 49 even if it were applicable.\n\n63.\n\nIf a tribunal rectifies a clerical, arithmetical or similar error, it is \"reopening\" the award and the award is accordingly amended. But there is no suggestion in Article 49 that in the process of acting on these specific grounds a tribunal can engage in a full scale revision of its factual and/or legal analysis, that is, change its mind on questions that it has identified as necessary for decision and which it has then decided. The *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* decision quoted in paragraph 56 above makes this crystal clear. The Convention itself likewise makes this clear by addressing revision of awards in another article.\n\n64.\n\nThis view as to the rectification procedure's limited purpose is shared by the discussion in the second edition of The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, where it is stated:\n\nArt. 49(2) provides a remedy for inadvertent omissions and minor technical errors in the award. It is not designed to afford a substantive review or reconsideration of the decision but enables the tribunal to correct mistakes that may have occurred in the award's drafting in a non-bureaucratic and expeditious manner.72\n\nThe ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd edition, pp 849-850 [emphasis added].\n\n65.\n\nIndeed, reference to the decided cases shows that the kind of \"error\" which is likely to be accepted as requiring rectification is one where both parties to the arbitration agree that an error requires correction, or where the party that has not moved to rectify the award nevertheless does not object to such a motion by the other party.73 It need hardly be said that this is not the situation in the present case.74 Nor, from the face of Ecuador's Motion, can it be said that the errors which it alleges have been committed by the Tribunal are characterised as falling within the category of minor errors.75 Article 49(2) is not concerned with re-opening an award to \"correct\" alleged errors of law.\n\nSee, for example, *Emilio Augustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Rectification of the Award, (Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, President, Thomas Buergenthal, and Maurice Wolf, Arbitrators), paras 18-20; *Noble Ventures v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11, Rectification of Award, (Professor Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel, President, Sir Jeremy Lever and Professor Pierre Marie-Dupuy, Arbitrators) para 7; *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Peru (formerly Emprasas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Peru, S.A.) v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Rectification of the Decision on Annulment of the *Ad hoc* Committee, (Justice Hans Danelius, President, Sir Franklin Berman and Professor Andrea Giardina, Arbitrators), para 8.\n\nLetter dated 11 November 2014 from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP to the Tribunal objecting to Ecuador's seeking to have the Tribunal reconsider its Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\nAt various points of the Motion, the Respondent alleges \"serious and fundamental\", \"manifest\" and \"gross\" errors. Motion, paras 11, 47, 135.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal finds therefore that Article 49 does not advance Ecuador's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\n(vi) Arbitration Rule 38\n------------------------\n\n67.\n\nRule 38 deals with a different situation, namely, that which obtains after the parties have presented their cases and the proceeding is declared closed. Rule 38(2) provides:\n\n\"Exceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, reopen the proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor, or that there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points.\"\n\n68.\n\nEcuador places considerable weight on this rule, but upon review it too is inapposite to the situation at hand.\n\n69.\n\nThe operative assumption of Rule 38 is that, after the proceeding has been closed but prior to the making of the award, either new evidence comes to light that could decisively affect the outcome of the case (in this first respect, Rule 38 echoes Article 51 of the Convention) *or* there is a vital need for clarification on certain specific points.\n\n70.\n\nSince it is unlikely that the tribunal itself would come into possession of new evidence on its own, the former limb would almost certainly be one that would be activated by a disputing party's filing a motion to reopen the proceeding on the ground that it had discovered new evidence of a decisive nature. This is not the situation in the present case.\n\n71.\n\nAs for the second limb, while not ruling out the possibility that a disputing party would seek clarification of certain specific points between the time of the hearing and the issuance of the award, the prospect seems rather remote. The wording implies that the second ground is one that is activated by the tribunal itself. This could be expected to occur where the tribunal, having declared the proceeding closed and then having engaged in deliberations, realises that one or more specific points needs to be clarified and therefore calls upon the parties to file additional evidence and/or submissions.\n\n72.\n\nThe point was made by the *ad hoc* Annulment Committee in *Libananco Holdings Co.**Limited v. Republic of Turkey* :\n\nIt is not unusual that, after written and oral proceedings are completed, during the course of deliberations tribunals discover issues that require further presentations by the parties. In the Committee\u2019s view, the Rule was not meant to require an immediate closure of the proceeding upon the last filing or hearing. Rather, each tribunal or committee must be assured, after proper deliberations, that it has all necessary arguments and evidence upon which it has reached or will reach a determination concerning all issues in the case. Closing the proceeding while deliberations are still underway may in fact interfere with the deliberations. This is particularly so when the deliberations concern the question whether or not the case should proceed to the merits, since the tribunal may not have made up its mind about its jurisdiction immediately upon the last presentation in the jurisdictional phase and it cannot close the proceeding if it decides to continue on the merits.76\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Excerpts of Decision on Annulment, (Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, President, Hans Danelius and Eduardo Silva Romero, Members), para 60 [Emphasis added].\n\n73.\n\nOnce again, this is not the situation in the present case. Thus, the Tribunal finds the second limb of Rule 38(2) is also inapposite in the circumstances at hand.\n\n(vii) Arbitration Rule 25\n-------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe next provision called into aid by the Respondent is Rule 25, Correction of Errors, which states as follows:\n\nAn accidental error in any instrument or supporting document may, with the consent of the other party or by leave of the Tribunal, be corrected at any time before the award is rendered.\n\n75.\n\nAlthough the Motion contends that there is a \"power to reopen and amend and/or reverse the record pursuant to Rule 25\" and further that \"provisions such as Rule 25 bestow upon the Arbitral Tribunal the power to permit significant amendments and corrections to the record\", in the Tribunal's view, this rule has no relevance to the present Motion.77 It plainly cannot be used to justify the Tribunal's 'reconsidering' its Decision in order to reverse its prior findings.\n\nMotion, paras 11, 75.\n\n(viii) Article 44 of the Convention\n-----------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nFinally, the Respondent has relied upon the Tribunal's residual discretion to decide a question of procedure which is not covered by Section 3 or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties.\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the matters raised in the Motion and the revisions requested fall within the *genus* of unaddressed procedural matters. To the contrary, as the foregoing review has shown, the circumstances in which a tribunal can reopen an award are comprehensively addressed and in specific and sometimes very narrow terms (as in the case of Article 51). The Tribunal once again recalls the terms of Convention Article 53, which provides: \"The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.\" There is simply no general power to reopen and reverse awards, nor does the Tribunal view the absence of such a general power to be a *lacuna* that needs to be filled in the sense that the *Abaclat* majority sought to fill a perceived gap in the Arbitration Rules when it came to so-called \"mass claims\".\n\n78.\n\nIt is not persuasive to seek to link together discrete provisions of the Convention and the Rules that were designed with specific purposes in mind and with varying degrees of the power to reopen an award in order to support the claimed existence of a power - whether general, procedural or otherwise - which is said to vest in a tribunal simply because it has issued a decision, as opposed to an award.\n\n79.\n\nThe examples provided by Ecuador, particularly *Abaclat* and *Churchill Mining*, are unavailing. The former case dealt with a very specific issue dealing with the question of whether a large number of claimants could bring a collective or mass claim under the applicable bilateral investment treaty and the ICSID Convention. At the jurisdictional stage, the majority of the tribunal concluded that there was a \"gap\" in the Convention and the Arbitration Rules which permitted it to formulate a means by which that group of claims could proceed collectively. Professor Abi-Saab dissented. Whether the tribunal was right or wrong in its analysis is not for this Tribunal to say; however, it appears to the Tribunal that this is an example of a tribunal in the early stages of a case seeking to design a procedure that would govern the special needs and demands of the case before it. As for *Churchill Mining*, the issue before that tribunal was purely procedural and simply involved the revisiting of a previously determined procedural schedule in light of new evidence that had been brought to the tribunal's attention. It is entirely different from the present Motion.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal also does not find Ecuador's appeal to the inherent powers of the Tribunal to advance its case. The clear structure of the Convention and the Arbitration Rules cannot be overridden by a general appeal to inherent powers.\n\n81.\n\nThis takes the Tribunal to *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*. The Tribunal refrained from forming a view as to whether it preferred the approach taken by the majority or by the dissenting arbitrator until it had the opportunity to study each of the provisions of the Convention and Arbitration Rules cited by Ecuador and the reasons therefor. Having done so, and having regard to the differences in approach as between the majority and the minority in that case, the Tribunal has little difficulty in expressing its general agreement with the approach taken by the majority.\n\n82.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal can see how Professor Abi-Saab could form his view that it was necessary for that tribunal to revisit a prior factual finding. His dissenting opinion was predicated upon Venezuela's submission of new evidence that was *not* available to the tribunal when it rendered its earlier merits decision and which he considered to be of great decisiveness on a particular issue going to the question of whether or not the respondent had breached its obligation to negotiate compensation for an expropriation in good faith.78 In his view, the tribunal was in the situation contemplated by Rule 38(2) (i.e., \"[e]xceptionally, the Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, reopen the proceeding on the ground that new evidence is forthcoming of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor...\") and it is understandable why he considered that Rule 38(2) ought to be applied in effect even if it is temporally limited. According to Professor Abi-Saab:\n\n\"...the Tribunal [was being] requested to exercise the power of limited reconsideration of its prior partial Decision of 3 September 2013, while the case is still pending before it, is that of correcting a claimed material error committed by the Tribunal itself in establishing the facts, as well as in the legal conclusions and consequences it drew from or built on these erroneously established facts.\"79\n\n*ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, para 401. Professor Abi-Saab agreed with much of the Decision but dissented on two issues, both of which came to the forefront of his dissent in the subsequent request for reconsideration. *ConocoPhillips* Dissenting Opinion, paras 38-51, 61-65.\n\n*ConocoPhillips* Dissenting Opinion, para 9 [emphasis added].\n\n83.\n\nThe basis for the application was Venezuela's contention that \"the Tribunal was under certain misapprehensions with respect to the parties' confidentiality commitments and the progress of the negotiations after the migration, as well as to consider some crucial related evidence recently revealed via Wikileaks.\"80\n\n*Id*., para 1.\n\n84.\n\nProfessor Abi-Saab found that in the prior Decision, from which he had also dissented, the majority had \"committed *a material error in establishing the facts*\" [his emphasis] in its treatment of settlement negotiations and from that it had divined \"a presumption - drawn from a single misconceived instance involving an error of fact - of a constant pattern of conduct attributable to the Respondent, of not hesitating to violate its obligations whenever it suited its purposes.\"81\n\n*Id*., para 17 [emphasis added].\n\n85.\n\nHe argued both for a general power of reconsideration and further, that if he was wrong on that point, for a specific power of reconsideration \"based on a particular or certain particular legal grounds\":82\n\n\"In sum, in certain contingencies which put or risk putting the credibility and integrity of the tribunal into question - such as its becoming aware that it had committed an error in interpreting evidence or in establishing the facts that led it astray in its legal findings; that the decision did not follow from the facts as determined; that new credible evidence demonstrate that the facts as established by the tribunal were based on wrong premises; or that changed circumstances have rendered the decision otherwise untenable - inherent jurisdiction empowers and even mandate the tribunal to reconsider the prior decision.\"83\n\n*Id*., para 52.\n\n*Id*., paras 52 and 61.\n\n86.\n\nThe present Tribunal takes a different view as to the existence of a general power of reconsideration as well as on Arbitration Rule 38(2). But in any case, the type of situation which so concerned Professor Abi-Saab is simply not present in the present case.\n\n87.\n\nNothing of the potential significance of the factual evidence that Venezuela adduced in support of its motion has been adduced by Ecuador. Professor Aguilar's 5th expert report could not be taken to constitute the kind of recently discovered evidence that came to light after the *ConocoPhillips* Decision had been issued.\n\n88.\n\nThus the facts in the *ConocoPhillips* case, in the view of this Tribunal, are so far removed as to deprive Professor Abi-Saab's views of any relevance to the instant case.\n\n**IV. The \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" complaints**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nEcuador has also raised various due process concerns. The Tribunal has already noted its view that it is not the appropriate body to review these types of complaints, since they are properly advanced before an *ad hoc* annulment committee. It will simply note that in complex cases such as the instant one, decisions must be taken at various points with respect to the way forward. It will illustrate the point by reference to one of Ecuador's complaints.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal is criticised for allegedly having given Perenco an additional opportunity to establish French control (with respect to the question of Perenco's standing to bring a claim under the Treaty) and for having \"specifically advised the Claimant of the argument it needed to develop and the issues it needed to prove (which it had thus far been unable to) in order for the Arbitral Tribunal to find jurisdiction.\"84 In Ecuador's view, \"this same treatment, i.e., the opportunity to be advised of the Arbitral Tribunal's legal and factual concerns and respond to them in further rounds of written and oral pleadings, was not accorded to Ecuador.\"85 It alleges that the Tribunal departed from the parties' pleaded cases on certain issues and based its decisions on propositions not presented by any of the parties and in so doing did not grant Ecuador the same opportunity or indeed any opportunity to provide its views on these newly developed propositions.86\n\nMotion, para 152.\n\nMotion, para 154.\n\nMotion, para 154.\n\n91.\n\nIt is not unusual for tribunals to defer consideration of jurisdictional objections pending a further development of the evidentiary record and tribunals commonly join jurisdictional issues to the merits, as indeed the Tribunal did in the instant case.87 Thus, the Decision on Jurisdiction did not signal the end of the jurisdictional phase. Having reflected on the parties' submissions and the evidence, the Tribunal decided it was appropriate to provide both parties with a further opportunity to address certain issues in respect of which the Tribunal was not yet prepared to rule.\n\nAt paragraph 86 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal, in discussing whether the Claimant had a right of standing held that the issue would be joined to the merits because in the Tribunal's view certain other issues should be clarified prior to arriving at a definitive view as to the Claimant's standing to invoke the Treaty.\n\n92.\n\nBoth parties were therefore given the opportunity over two rounds of written pleadings to adduce further factual and expert evidence and to make submissions. With respect to questions of Bahamian law, both sides adduced expert evidence on questions such as the status of shares owned by an individual who died intestate and the steps required under Bahamian law to effect the transfer of title to the shares. Both parties also addressed the Treaty's negotiating history, with Ecuador urging the Tribunal to pay particularly close attention to the evolution of the relevant provisions (as recorded in paragraphs 492 to 499 of the Decision), while Perenco's main argument was that the plain meaning of the text prevailed, and further that the negotiating history was too fragmentary and incomplete to be reliable.\n\n93.\n\nThere was nothing in Ecuador's Counter Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims which suggested that Ecuador was not comfortable with the additional opportunity given to both parties to address Perenco's claimed standing to invoke the Treaty. Indeed, Ecuador's first pleading in the next phase requested the Tribunal to further bifurcate the proceeding so as to deal with all remaining jurisdictional issues before proceeding to the merits.88 The Counter-Memorial also devoted 71 paragraphs to recounting the factual aspects of the Perrodo family's claim to control Perenco, and 38 paragraphs on the Treaty's structure when analysed in light of its negotiating history.89\n\nCounter Memorial on Liability and Counterclaim, para 12.\n\nCounter Memorial on Liability and Counterclaim, paras 27-98 and 99-137, respectively.\n\n94.\n\nEcuador now expresses its surprise at the Tribunal's asking for the negotiating history in its Decision on Jurisdiction and then not discussing the produced texts in detail in its next Decision: \"Ecuador fails to understand why the Arbitral Tribunal requested further evidence on the issue if it considered the history of the negotiations to be irrelevant.\"90\n\nMotion, para 156.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal did not consider the *travaux* to be irrelevant. While it expressly refrained from expressing a view in its Decision on Jurisdiction as to whether or not the negotiating history would assist it in deciding the point, the Tribunal was interested in examining such records as might be available and for that reason requested the parties to jointly approach the French authorities with a view to obtaining the relevant documents and make submissions thereon to the Tribunal. Upon carefully reviewing the parties' submissions and the negotiating history, the Tribunal did not find the negotiating history to provide a determinate answer to the interpretative question that was different from the interpretation ultimately arrived at. (This explains the way in which the Tribunal expressed its findings at paragraphs 509 to 511 and 528.) A more elaborate set of reasons would not have led to a different result.\n\n96.\n\nThere are a myriad of different ways in which a Decision or an Award can be drafted. The objective is to organize and decide the questions presented for decision in a suitably comprehensive and comprehensible fashion, at all times having regard to the fundamental imperative of treating the disputing parties equally and in accordance with due process. This is what the Tribunal has sought to do.\n\n**V. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n97.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that there is no power vested in it which would allow it to engage in the exercise requested of it, namely, to issue a decision amending its Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and Liability dated 12 September 2014 in respect of any of the seven issues identified by Ecuador in its Motion. Article 52 of the Convention does not vest this Tribunal with the power to reopen, amend and/or reverse a decision preliminary to its award. Similarly, the grounds for rectification of an award in Article 49 or revision of an award under Article 51 do not assist the Motion. Rules 25 and 38 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules likewise do not provide any support for the Motion. Article 44 of the Convention does not establish a general power of reconsideration of a tribunal's decisions. Finally, there is no basis for the invocation of the Tribunal's inherent powers. Such powers cannot be used to circumvent the Convention's and the Arbitral Rules' plain language when it comes to amending or otherwise re-opening an award. To the extent that it has responded to particular arguments advanced by Ecuador in its Motion with respect to specific findings of the Decision, the Tribunal has done so purely for illustrative purposes and without prejudice to its decision that it does not have the power to reopen and reconsider its findings in the manner for which Ecuador has contended.\n\n**VI.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. Parties**\n--------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant is Perenco Ecuador Limited, and is hereinafter referred to as \" **Perenco** \" or the \" **Claimant.** \"\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Ecuador and is hereinafter referred to as \" **Ecuador** \" or the \" **Respondent**.\"\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \" **Parties**.\" The Parties' respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**B. Dispute**\n--------------\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute arises out of a series of measures adopted by the Respondent which, according to Perenco, were in breach of Ecuador's obligations under the *Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Republic of Ecuador on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments* (the \" **Treaty** \" or the \" **BIT** \") and two participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of Blocks 7 and 21 (the \" **Blocks** \") situated in the Ecuadorian Amazonian region. The Tribunal ruled on these claims in its Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability, dispatched to the Parties on 12 September 2014.\n\n5.\n\nDuring the course of the written submissions phase of the prior proceedings, on 5 December 2011, Ecuador presented two counterclaims pursuant to Rule 40 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \" **Arbitration Rules** \").1 These related to allegations that Perenco is liable for environmental and infrastructural damage in Blocks 7 and 21. This interim decision will only address the environmental counterclaim.\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims dated 5 December 2011 (\"Ecuador's Counter Memorial\"), paragraph 26.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 13 July 2011, Ecuador informed the Tribunal that \"it may submit various counterclaims with its counter-memorial [on liability],\" including those brought against Perenco's partner in Blocks 7 and 21, Burlington Resources (\" **Burlington** \").2\n\nEcuador also advanced similar counterclaims against Perenco's consortium partner, Burlington Resources Inc. (\"Burlington\") ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5. After consultation with the parties, the *Burlington* tribunal chose to confine the hearing on liability in March 2011 to the claims advanced by Burlington and to have a separate hearing on the counterclaims. The tribunal's Decision on Liability on Burlington's claims was dispatched to the parties on 14 December 2012. See *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability (14 December 2012) [hereinafter *Burlington v. Ecuador* ].\n\n7.\n\nOn 28 July 2011, the Tribunal, in consultation with the Parties, fixed the procedural calendar for the counterclaims.\n\n8.\n\nOn 17 November 2011, Ecuador requested a 10-day extension in which to file its Counter-Memorial and its Counterclaims, due on 25 November 2011. Ecuador also confirmed that \"while further work is ongoing in Ecuador regarding the extent of the environmental damage caused by Perenco, Ecuador will file on 5 December its counterclaim save as to quantum.\"3\n\nSee Ecuador's letter to the Tribunal dated 17 November 2011.\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 November 2011, Perenco confirmed that \"in principle, it had no objection to reasonable schedule accommodations,\"4 but it sought assurances from Ecuador that it would file its entire counterclaim on the proposed amended date.\n\nSee Perenco's letter to the Tribunal dated 21 November 2011.\n\n10.\n\nOn 24 November 2011, the Tribunal granted Ecuador's request of 17 November and amended the procedural calendar, providing Claimant's with a similar extension of time. The Tribunal also drew the Parties' attention to ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(2)5 and requested the Respondent to \"inform it at the time of the filing of its counter-claim precisely what additional steps it needs to undertake in order complete its counter-claim, so that the Claimant is able to respond thereto having regard to the procedural schedule as amended.\"6\n\nRule 40(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that \"a counter-claim [shall be presented] no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.\"\n\nSee Tribunal's letter to the Parties dated 24 November 2011.\n\n11.\n\nOn 5 December 2011, Ecuador filed a Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims (\" **Ecuador's Counter-Memorial** \"). It was accompanied by the witness statements of Dr. Galo Chiriboga Zambrano, Mr. Pablo Luna, Mr. Diego Montenegro, Mr. Derlis Palacios, Mr. Wilson Pastor Morris, Mr. Germ\u00e1nico Pinto, Mr. Marco Puente, Mr. Manuel Sol\u00eds, the third witness statement of Dr. Christian D\u00e1valos, and the expert reports of Integrated Environmental Management Services S.A. de C.V. (IEMS), Mr. Brian Moree QC, RPS Energy, Fair Links, Mr. Ricardo Crespo Plaza and Professor Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade (third).\n\n12.\n\nOn the same date, Ecuador answered the Tribunal's request of 24 November by noting that its environmenrtal expert IEMS \"is currently undertaking the final stage of its three-stage environmental audit of areas within Blocks 7 and 21 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region. The purpose of this final stage is twofold: (i) to quantify the volume of contaminated soil and underground water pollution in some of the locations that IEMS has already determined, through laboratory analysis, are significantly contaminated; and (ii) to confirm the existence of contamination in other areas identified in its report where IEMS' investigation has led to indicia of pollution.\"7\n\nSee Ecuador's letter to the Tribunal dated 5 December 2011.\n\n13.\n\nOn 4 January 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to hold a telephone conference on 13 January 2012 to \"consider the further procedural calendar covering not only Perenco's claim (including the remaining jurisdictional issues) and Ecuador's counterclaims, but also the issues of the quantum in relation to the main claim and the counterclaim.\"8\n\nSee Tribunal's letter to the Parties dated 4 January 2012.\n\n14.\n\nOn 13 January 2012, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties and invited them to reach agreements on the procedural calendar.\n\n15.\n\nOn 19 January 2012, the Parties confirmed to the Tribunal that: \"Ecuador has no objection to releasing Perenco from the 12 April 2012 date for the filing of its Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims. This is premised on the understanding that Perenco has no objection to Ecuador submitting a supplemental memorial on its counterclaims (including a supplemental report by IEMS) (i) before Perenco submits its Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims and (ii), in any event, not earlier than 30 April 2012.\"9\n\nSee Ecuador's letter dated 17 January 2012 and Perenco's letter dated 19 January 2012.\n\n16.\n\nOn 3 February 2012, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement regarding the procedural calendar for the counterclaims.10\n\nSee Perenco's letter dated 3 February 2012 and Ecuador's email dated 7 February 2012.\n\n17.\n\nOn 13 February 2012, the Tribunal fixed a new procedural calendar in light of the agreement reached by the Parties.11\n\nSee Tribunal's letter to the Parties dated 13 February 2012.\n\n18.\n\nOn 27 April 2012, the Respondent filed a Supplemental Memorial on Counterclaims (the \" **Supplemental Memorial** \"). It was accompanied by the second witness statements of Mr. Pablo Luna and Mr. Diego Montenegro, and the second expert report of IEMS.\n\n19.\n\nOn September 28, 2012, Perenco filed a Counter-memorial on Counterclaims (\" **Claimant's Counter-Memorial** \"). It was accompanied by the witness statements of Mr. Wilfrido Saltos, Mr. Eric d'Argentr\u00e9 (third), and Mr. Alex Mart\u00ednez, and the expert reports of GSI Environmental, Intertek APTECH, and Prof. Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n.\n\n20.\n\nOn 9 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning Ecuador's request for production of documents regarding its counterclaims.12\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Orders Nos. 1, 2, and 3 in the context of the jurisdiction and liability phase.\n\n21.\n\nOn 5 February 2013, the Parties agreed to extend the deadline for Ecuador to submit its Reply on Counterclaims, with a corresponding extension to Claimant's deadline to submit its Rejoinder on Counterclaims.\n\n22.\n\nOn 12 February 2013, the Tribunal adopted the procedural calendar as modified by the Parties.\n\n23.\n\nOn 22 February 2013, Ecuador submitted its Reply on Counterclaims (the \" **Reply** \"). It was accompanied by the witness statements of Mr. Saulo Carrasco, Mr. Pablo Luna (third), Mr. Diego Montenegro (third), Minister Germ\u00e1nico Pinto (third), and Mr. Manuel Sol\u00eds (second); as well as the expert reports of IEMS (third), RPS (third), and Professor Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Nav\u00e1rez.\n\n24.\n\nOn 22 May 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 concerning the Claimant's application to compel disclosure of documents by the Respondent.\n\n25.\n\nOn 4 June 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 regarding the Claimant's requests to compel disclosure of certain documents by the Respondent pursuant to Procedural Order No. 5.\n\n26.\n\nOn 12 July 2013, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Counterclaims (the \" **Rejoinder** \"). It was accompanied by the the witness statements of Mr. Wilfrido Saltos (second), Mr. Eric d'Argentr\u00e9 (fourth), and Mr. Gilberto Mart\u00ednez (second), as well as the expert reports of Dr. Shahrokh Rouhani, GSI Environmental (second), Intertek (second), and Prof. Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n (second).\n\n27.\n\nOn 19 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 regarding the organization of the hearing on Counterclaims.\n\n28.\n\nOn 2 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 regarding the Respondent's request to introduce into the record additional evidence in connection with the hearing on counterclaims.\n\n29.\n\nThe hearing on Counterclaims was held at The Hague, from 9-17 September 2013.

ENVIRONMENTAL COUNTERCLAIM**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n34.\n\nEcuador presented the environmental counterclaim on the basis that its experts had determined the existence of an \"environmental catastrophe\" in the two oil blocks situated in the country's Amazonian rainforest that had been worked by the consortium under Perenco's operatorship.13 Ecuador viewed this as an extremely serious matter deserving the most careful consideration by the Tribunal.14 On this point, the Tribunal cannot but agree. Proper environmental stewardship has assumed great importance in today's world. The Tribunal agrees that if a legal relationship between an investor and the State permits the filing of a claim by the State for environmental damage caused by the investor's activities and such a claim is substantiated, the State is entitled to full reparation in accordance with the requirements of the applicable law.\n\n2nd Expert Report of IEMS dated 26 April 2012 (\"IEMS ER II\"), p 3; Supplemental Memorial, section 4; cf. Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims dated 28 September 2012 (\"Claimant's Counter-Memorial\"), paragraph 1.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 19-23 (Opening Statement of Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carr\u00ed\u00f3n).\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal further recognises that a State has wide latitude under international law to prescribe and adjust its environmental laws, standards and policies in response to changing views and a deeper understanding of the risks posed by various activities, including those of extractive industries such as oilfields. All of this is beyond any serious dispute and the Tribunal enters into this phase of the proceeding mindful of the fundamental imperatives of the protection of the environment in Ecuador.\n\n**(1) Summary of the Parties' Submissions**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nEcuador has requested the Tribunal to find Perenco liable for the costs of remedying environmental damage in Blocks 7 and 21, quantified at US$ 2,279,544.559 for soil clean-up costs, US$ 265,601,700 for groundwater remediation costs and US$ 3,380,000 for further groundwater studies (subject to payment of compound interest from the date of the Award until the date of full payment).15 It asserted that Perenco \"abandoned Blocks 7 and 21 in a state which makes a mockery of the nowadays universal, well-established legal principles aimed at protecting the environment.\"16 Such principles are said to be reflected in both Ecuadorian law and in the Consortium's obligations under the Participation Contracts.17 In particular, the 2008 Constitution expressly prescribes a regime of strict liability (\" *responsabilidad objetiva* \") for environmental damage and establishes that the Ecuadorian people have the fundamental right to a healthy environment.18 The strict liability regime reflects the \"polluter-payer principle\", defined by Ecuador as the proposition that \"[h]e who causes pollution must, under all circumstances, assume the costs of repairing it.\"19 Ecuador submitted that under this regime it \"need only establish the existence of environmental damage and that such damage is found in Blocks 7 and 21, where Perenco operated, that is, where it performed petroleum activities, for Perenco to be strictly liable to the State.\"20 It asserted this was the case both before and after the 2008 Constitution's entry into force, since the Ecuadorian courts have since 2002 applied a strict liability regime to claims of environmental damage resulting from hazardous activities.21\n\nIEMS ER II, p 1; 3rd Expert Report of IEMS dated 21 February 2013 (\"IEMS ER III\"), pp 1, 3 and 128 (\"In conclusion, IEMS confirm its original findings and conclusions. Some minor adjustments are warranted to the volumes of the contaminated soil and estimated costs for soil remediation, which is estimated at $2,279,544.559 USD (considering exceedances of background levels) or $831,125,954 USD (if remediation is limited to concentrations exceeding regulatory criteria). Groundwater remediation will cost and between [sic] $41,277,600 and $265,601,700 USD\"); Ecuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 978, 980, 981; Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 9, 416, 418-419, 425; Ecuador's Reply Memorial on Counterclaims dated 22 February 2013 (\"Reply\"), paragraphs 542, 544-545. In its Counter-Memorial, Ecuador's request was for Perenco to be found liable to remedy any and all environmental damage in Blocks 7 and 21 and in lieu of this be made to pay the full costs of remedying said damage. Ecuador submitted that since Perenco has left the Blocks and the Participation Contracts terminated, it is no longer in a position to itself go about remedying the damage and is thus required to bear the burden of the costs of Ecuador being made to do so in its stead.

Claimant's Rejoinder on Counterclaims dated 12 July 2013 (\"Rejoinder\"), paragraphs 298-307.\n\nIn addition to the 25 which it did notify Ecuadorian authorities had occurred. See Reply, paragraphs 46-52 (19 according to the list of oil spills produced by GSI and a further 22 according to the evidence of Ecuador's witness, Mr. Manual Sol\u00eds); 1st Expert Report of GSI, Appendix B3 (Oil Spills as of 20 September 2012); 2nd Witness Statement of Manuel Sol\u00eds, paragraph 76.\n\n39.\n\nIt alleged further that Perenco has sought to evade its liability for environmental damage in the Blocks by relying on a set of environmental audits of Blocks 7 and 21 commissioned by the Consortium in 2008 and submitted to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, later the Ministry of Non-Renewable Natural Resources (\" **the Ministry** \"), for approval.27 While the 2008 audits found several minor non-compliances with regulatory requirements in Block 7, they ultimately concluded that the Consortium's operations in the Blocks complied with Ecuadorian environmental regulations.28\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 656, 687-688; Reply, paragraphs 282-286\n\nExhibits CE-CC-182, Biannual Environmental Audit of Block 7 and Coca-Payamino Unified Field, Two Years Prior to the Expiration of the Block 7 Participation Contract, November 2008, pp 81-83 and CE-CC-183, Biannual Environmental Audit of Block 21, November 2008, sections 7.1-7.3; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 28, 42, 173, 174 cf. Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 6.\n\n40.\n\nEcuador submitted that this was false as a matter of fact and law, and pointed to different, and in its view more credible, results of a technical inspection that it commissioned in August 2009, shortly after the government intervened to take possession of the Blocks when the Consortium suspended operations.29 Ecuador characterised the 2008 audits as flawed, and rejected Perenco's claim that they had been approved by the Ministry.30 Even if they had been approved, Ecuador contends, such ministerial approvals could not constitute a full defence under its law in a subsequent proceeding for environmental liability such as the present one.31\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 656, 687-688; Reply, paragraphs 268-286.\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 687; Reply, section 3.1.3.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraphs 6, 40-43; Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 96-98; Reply, paragraph 11.\n\n41.\n\nIn seeking to prove its environmental claim, Ecuador relied on the evidence of its experts, Integrated Environmental Management Services S.A. de C.V. (\" **IEMS** \") of Monterrey, Mexico, to submit that there was \"significant environmental damage to soil and underground water in Blocks 7 and 21.\"32 IEMS found that the soil in 94% of the 74 locations it tested in Blocks 7 and 21 were contaminated as a result of petroleum activities, as were all of the 18 sites it tested for groundwater contamination.33\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 7, section 4. IEMS submitted four expert reports, dated 29 November 2011, 26 April 2012, 21 February 2013 and 4 September 2013.\n\nIEMS ER II, pp 138-142, 180-181; Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 7, 176, 288-289.\n\n42.\n\nEcuador also submitted three reports by the Energy Division of RPS Group (\" **RPS** \"), an international consultancy that provides advice on the development of natural resources, land and property, and the management of the environment.34 RPS's reports initially addressed the risk and existence of damage to the wells and reservoirs in Blocks 7 and 21 as a result of the shut-in of wells in July 2009,35 and, as the expert evidence was sequentially developed in the counterclaim, on what RPS considered to be the \"flaws in [Perenco's environmental experts, GSI's] site investigation program.\"36 Ecuador relied on the first two RPS reports chiefly for the purposes of the claims brought by Perenco that were the subject of the Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability. RPS's third report, of February 2013, sought to rebut GSI's expert report, concluding that GSI's \"opinion..,[was] not correct\" and that RPS's review of record evidence contradicted GSI's conclusion that Perenco's operations in the Blocks complied with applicable regulations and industry practices.37\n\n1st Expert Report of RPS dated 25 November 2011 (\"RPS ER I\"), paragraph 8, see also paragraph 11 which identifies as a core part of RPS's advisory business the estimation of reserves, forecasts of future production and estimation of future economic performance. 2nd Expert Report of RPS dated 25 July 2012 (\"RPS ER II\"), and 3rd Expert Report of RPS dated February 2013 (\"RPS ER III\").\n\nRPS ER I, paragraphs 5-6, 161 (RPS concluded that mechanical and environmental damage can occur with an associated loss of production and determined that \"at least 14 wells in Blocks 7 and 21 showed\" evidence of such damage).\n\nRPS ER II, p 5; RPS ER III, sections 1.3, 2, 3, 4 and 7.\n\nSee conclusions of RPS in section 7 of RPS ER III.\n\n43.\n\nFor its part, Perenco submitted that the Tribunal should dismiss Ecuador's environmental claim in its entirety and award costs in its favour and such other and further relief as the Tribunal deemed just and proper.38 Perenco emphatically rejected Ecuador's depiction of the condition of Blocks 7 and 21 as an \"environmental catastrophe.\"39 It submitted that, to the contrary, Perenco was a \"responsible manager that focused on, preserved, and even improved the environmental and infrastructural integrity of the Blocks\" and the environmental counterclaim was a transparent attempt by Ecuador to create a counterweight to, and divert attention from, the serious breaches of contract and Treaty that formed the basis of Perenco's claim.40\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 189-198, 642-644; Rejoinder, part IV (paragraphs 434-437). Perenco in its Rejoinder submitted that Ecuador had acknowledged that \"it would be improper for Ecuador to obtain double recovery as a result of having asserted the same counterclaims against both Perenco and Burlington\" cf. Reply, paragraphs 551-553. Perenco further submitted that if the Tribunal \"were to find that liability exists for environmental conditions created by Ecuador's State-owned oil companies, it should order Ecuador to provide an indemnity against third-party claims arising from those conditions.\" (Rejoinder, paragraph 435).\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 1-3, 8-25; Rejoinder, paragraphs 1-21; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 170-178 (Opening Statement of Mark Friedman).\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 1-25; Rejoinder, paragraphs 2, 289-297.\n\n44.\n\nPerenco also contended that Ecuador's environmental claim was deficient as a matter of law.41 Under the applicable Ecuadorian law, the claim, which concerned alleged contamination from activities Perenco undertook in the Blocks from 2002 to July 2009, was governed by a fault-based, not strict liability, regime, \"since any changes made by the 2008 Constitution (which entered into force in October 2008) |could not| have any retroactive effect.\"42 Perenco observed it would be inconsistent with the Constitution's proscription against the retroactive application of law to hold it to a regime that did not apply for most of the time that it operated the Blocks.43\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 189-198; Rejoinder, paragraphs 4-21.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 190, 199; Rejoinder, paragraph 15.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 15, 308, 318-328; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 291-293 (Opening Statement of Ina C. Popova); Ecuador's Reply Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 9.\n\n45.\n\nUnder the regime applicable prior to the 2008 Constitution's entry into force, an operator could not be found liable for environmental damage if it had complied with its duty of care to act as a responsible operator.44 Since Perenco could prove it had satisfied its duty of care, there could be no finding of liability.45 Even if a strict liability regime did apply (which was not conceded), Ecuador still bore the burden of proving that \"the Consortium *caused* environmental harm - *i.e.* an environmental effect that exceed[ed] applicable regulatory limits.\"46\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 498-504.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 498-504. Perenco does not accept that it bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that it had satisfied its duty of care; its submission is that Ecuador must establish for each site that the Consortium engaged in wrongful (negligent or malicious) conduct in breach of its duty of care: see Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 190, 196, 200; Rejoinder, paragraphs 15, 22, 290.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 190, 199 [Italics in original].\n\n46.\n\nUltimately, Perenco submitted that Ecuador must \"cumulatively establish for each site [claimed to be contaminated] that: (*1*) the Consortium engaged in a wrongful (negligent or malicious) act in breach of its duty of care; (*2*) Ecuador suffered harm (*i.e.* environmental damage consisting of a regulatory exceedance); and (*3*) a causal nexus [that] exist[ed] between the wrongful act and Ecuador's alleged harm.\"47 If it succeeded in proving the foregoing, Ecuador then bore the burden of proving \"the quantum of the loss suffered as a consequence of the harm.\"48\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 190 [Italics in original], taken from the 1st report of its legal expert Rene Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 49.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 190, taken from the 1st report of its legal expert Rene Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 49.\n\n47.\n\nPerenco argued further that quite apart from the foregoing legal requirements for establishing liability, the environmental counterclaim was subject to temporal limits.49 At one end of the events in question, i.e., in relation to damage caused after the government's July 2009 takeover of the two Blocks, Perenco obviously could not be held liable for damage caused by the operator which succeeded it, namely, Petroamazonas.50 As for the other end of the events in question, Perenco argued that it could not be liable for any damage that predated January 2007, the maximum permissible period for claiming damage under the four-year statute of limitations prescribed by Ecuadorian law.51\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 21-24, 190-198; Rejoinder, paragraphs 15, 241-242.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 21-24, 190-198; Rejoinder, paragraphs 15, 241-242.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 21-24, 190-198; Rejoinder, paragraphs 15, 241-242.\n\n48.\n\nPutting the legal issues aside, on the matter of the evidence submitted by Ecuador in support of its claim, Perenco submitted there were \"systematic\" and \"fundamental\" flaws in the methodology employed by IEMS when investigating the Blocks, with the result that its findings were invalid.52 As for the RPS report, it was a \"hypothetical assessment\" of risks and did not lend further credence to IEMS' findings.53 In Perenco's view, rather than a US$2.4 billion cost of remediation, the more realistic cost was \"under US$10 million.\"54 This related to \"minor regulatory exceedances\" posing no \"threat to human health or the environment.\"55\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 5-7, 10-14, 25.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 26-27, 294; see also, Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief dated 22 November 2013 (\"Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief\"), paragraphs 35, 41, 45 and 50.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18-21; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 8, p 2270 (\"limited pockets of areas potentially warranting remediation in Ecuador.scattered around at 17 sites.They pose no risk to human health, even on extraordinarily tough standards.all of them could be remediated for less than $11 million\") (Closing Statement of Mark Friedman).\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18-21. Perenco submitted in this regard that GSI had demonstrated that these \"minor exceedances\" did not pose any threat to human health or the environment (Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 21).\n\n49.\n\nHaving investigated the blocks, Perenco's expert, GSI Environmental, Inc. (\" **GSI** \"), opined that there were \"no widespread environmental impacts, no impacts to groundwater and only limited impacts to soil, no risk to human health and livestock, and no impacts to surface water, air quality or ecological resources.\"56 GSI analysed sampling results from its own and IEMS' field investigation, visiting 58 sites, most of which were sites at which IEMS had found exceedances.57\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 3; see 1st Expert Opinion of John A. Connor, P.E., P.G., B.C.E.E., and Gino Bianchi Mosquera, D.Env., P.G., Regarding Environmental Conditions in the Coca-Payamino Unified Field, Block 7, and Block 21, Oriente Region, Ecuador, 1st Expert Report of GSI Environmental Inc., dated 20 September 2012 (\"GSI ER I\"), paragraphs 6-11.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 233-235; GSI ER I, paragraphs 2-5, Appendix D (GSI Site Sampling and Testing Program).\n\n50.\n\nIn both Perenco's and GSI's view, the exceedances resulted mainly from Ecuador's (and its experts') insistence on employing so-called \"background values\" (Perenco's preferred translation of the relevant provision of TULAS) or \"base values\" (Ecuador's preferred translation), rather than the regulatory criteria prescribed by Ecuadorian law.58 IEMS had in the first instance compared its soil samples to the alleged background values (i.e., the normally occurring incidences of certain elements in the natural environment) and where such values had been exceeded, IEMS had concluded that the samples were contaminated by oilfield activities.59 Perenco argued that Ecuadorian law recognised that oilfield activities inevitably result in a measure of contamination, but that law prescribed acceptable levels of contaminants resulting from permitted activities.60 The only relevant question, in Perenco's view, was whether the Consortium had exceeded the limits of the regulations applicable to its operations.61\n\nSee, for e.g., Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 9. Perenco referred to it as the \"average background values\" or *\"\u2018valores de fondo\"* - i.e., the average level of substances naturally occurring in the environment in the absence of any human intervention\" (Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 9 |Italics in original|). Ecuador used the term \"base values\", defining it is the \"levels of concentration of contaminants naturally present in Blocks 7 and 21\": see Reply, paragraph 82. See also, Expert Opinion of Shahrokh Rouhani, Ph.D., P.E. Regarding Calculation of Impacted Soil Volumes in Block 7, Block 21 and the Coca-Payamino United Field, Oriente Region, Ecuador dated 26 June 2013 (\"Rouhani ER\"), section 4.2. The Tribunal will use both terms.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraphs 158-161; Reply, paragraphs 20, 82-89; IEMS ER II, Section IV.1.A.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 10-12.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 240-311.\n\n51.\n\nPerenco, GSI and its expert on geostatistical analysis, Dr. Shahrokh Rouhani, an environmental scientist and founder of NewFields Companies, LLC, also strongly criticised IEMS' plotting of the alleged contamination in the two Blocks. IEMS employed a computer software programme called ArcView GIS 10.0 to graphically map the extent of contamination which it said pervaded the Blocks.62 GSI considered that this was inconsistent with the accepted practice in the industry of employing site delineation, whereby a site that is considered to be contaminated is delineated by taking samples in the immediate vicinity of the contaminated sample and then working outwards from that point until the sampling no longer reveals any contamination.63 For his part, Dr. Rouhani opined that IEMS' use of the ArcView GIS 10.0 software was flawed and had led to a vast exaggeration of the contamination alleged to exist in the two Blocks.64\n\n1st Expert Report of IEMS dated 29 November 2011 (\"IEMS ER I\"), p 63.\n\nGSI ER I, section 3.9.6, in particular, paragraph 139, see Appendix D, D.5.1 (Methodology to Estimate Potentially Impacted Areas). See below at paragraph 209 for detailed explanation of the method that GSI used.\n\nRouhani ER, section 4.1.\n\n52.\n\nPerenco acknowledged that there was some minor evidence of contamination in the Blocks, but submitted that once Ecuador's use of background values rather than the regulatory criteria that were actually applicable under Ecuadorian law was rejected as being legally unsustainable, and once the proper land-use criteria were applied and the errors and inaccuracies in IEMS' methodology and findings were corrected, the volume of contaminated soil for which Ecuador could possibly claim damages dropped from nearly 2 billion cubic metres of soil to only 33,415 cubic meters of soil, with the quantum of damages dropping commensurately. To be specific, in Perenco's submission, the potentially awardable damages dropped from approximately US$2.4 billion to US$9.1 million.65\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 192-193, 231-239; GSI ER I paragraphs 150, 219, 226-231, Table 3. At paragraph 276 of its Counter-Memorial, the Claimant states that \"the difference between applying \u2018background values' and applying the most stringent standard of the RAOH is the difference between US$2.2 billion and US$895 million in alleged remediation costs\". Rejoinder, paragraphs 217-240.\n\n53.\n\nIn Perenco's view, therefore, Ecuador's counterclaims were \"opportunistic\" and had been brought in \"retaliation\" for Perenco's having seised the Tribunal with its contract and Treaty claims.66 Perenco asserted that from the time that the Government took over the Blocks on 16 July 2009 until 5 December 2011 (the date on which Ecuador first advanced its Counterclaim) Ecuador gave \"no prior indication that it had encountered environmental or infrastructural issues or that it would make any such claims.\"67 In fact, since the State's taking over the Blocks, Petroamazonas had not only operated the Blocks at their full capacity, it had expanded operations.68\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 2, 4-6;

that field was then separately operated by *Petroproducci\u00f3n*.79 At the time, the Coca and Payamino fields were thought to constitute different oil reservoirs and it was only in 1987, when CEPE drilled the Payamino 2 well, that it was discovered that they produced from a single reservoir.80 When Oryx acquired BP's interest in September 1990, it also entered into a joint operating agreement with Petroecuador for the Coca and Payamino fields.81 The area was thereafter known as the Coca-Payamino Unified Field, with Oryx and *Petroproducci\u00f3n* taking turns acting as the operator.82 Perenco emphasised that according to IEMS' data, this area (which had been worked for some time before Perenco appeared on the scene) \"accounts for 52% of Ecuador's total soil contamination claims and 44% of its total groundwater claims.\"83\n\n1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraph 34;

The Framework of the Applicable Law**\n------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nEcuador began to develop an environmental regulatory regime for oilfield activities in the 1970s...100 In 1971, it enacted the Hydrocarbons Law (*Ley de Hidrocarburos*); this was amended in 1982 to oblige Petroecuador and its contractors to comply with national environmental laws and regulations.101 In its 1984 Constitution, Ecuador recognised the individual's right to live in an environment free from pollution and, in this connection, specified that the law should necessarily establish \"restrictions to the exercise of certain rights or liberties for the sake of environmental protection.\"102\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 3; Reply, paragraph 17; 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 11; 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraph 13; Exhibit CE-CC-269, Chronology of Ecuador's Environmental Laws and Regulations.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-269, Chronology of Ecuador's Environmental Laws and Regulations. At the time, the Hydrocarbons Law referred to the *Corporaci\u00f3n Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana* (CEPE), which was created in 1972 and then later replaced by Petroecuador (See 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, Appendix B). Also, in 1976, Ecuador enacted the Law for the Prevention and Control of Environmental Contamination (1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 12).\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 13, footnote 11, quoting from Annex CA-CC-9, 1978 Constitution, codified in 1984, and published in Official Register No. 763 of June 12, 1984, Article 19.\n\n66.\n\nIn 1995 Ecuador promulgated the Environmental Regulations for Hydrocarbon Operations in Ecuador (*Reglamento Ambiental para las Operaciones Hidrocarbur\u00edferas en el* *Ecuador* (\" **RAOHE** \"103) to regulate the exploration, development and production of crude oil, oil derivatives and natural gas. It designated the Undersecretariat for Environmental Protection and the National Directorate of Environmental Protection as the competent authority in environmental matters.104\n\nExhibit EL-147, *Decree 1215 Reglamento Ambiental para las Operaciones Hidrocarbur\u00edferas en el Ecuador*, (\"RAOHE\") published in the Official Register No. 265 on 13 February 2001 (unofficial translation of extracts).\n\n*Ibid.* RAOHE is addressed in further detail below.\n\n67.\n\nFrom 1995 to 2001, the principles of prevention, rehabilitation and prevention of environmental harm were introduced by Ecuador into its Constitution, and the 1999 Environmental Management Law (*Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental*) was enacted.105 In 2001, the RAOHE was amended by Decree 1215 which introduced contaminant limits for soil.106 In 2002, the Regulation of Hydrocarbon Operations (*Reglamento de Operaciones Hidrocarbur\u00edferas* (\" **ROH** \")) was promulgated.107 ROH differed from RAOHE in that it did not address contaminant limits or regulatory requirements relating to audits and reporting to the Ministry; rather it addressed specific steps in the hydrocarbon production process, such as in the drilling or sealing of a well, and how they should be carried out by the operator in such a way as to be protective of the environment.108\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, July 30, 1999 Environmental Management Law (*Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental*) (\"Enviromental Management Law\"), Codification 19, published in Supplemental Official Registry No. 418 of September 10, 2004 (revised translation submitted by Perenco together with its letter of 16 October 2013).\n\nOn 13 February 2001.

Exhibit EL-147, RAOHE.\n\n68.\n\nIn 2003, Ecuador promulgated the Unified Text of Secondary Environmental Legislation (*Texto Unificado de Legislaci\u00f3n Ambiental Secundaria* (\" **TULAS** \")), which sets out rules for the evaluation of the environmental impact of oilfield activities from a technical perspective to the extent they are not addressed in environmental regulation specific to the type of activity in question.109 TULAS is of general application to all manner of activities that may cause an impact on the environment.110\n\nExhibit EL-146, *Texto Unificado de Legislaci\u00f3n Ambiental Secundaria*, (\"TULAS\") published in the Official Register No. E 2 on 31 March 2003.

See also, 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, Appendix B, paragraph 5.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n69.\n\nOn 20 October 2008, Ecuador amended its Constitution.111 The 2008 Constitution's relevance and significance for the counterclaim is an important matter and will be addressed in further detail in the Tribunal's decision below.\n\n1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraph 14; Exhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador (\"2008 Constitution\"), Official Register No. 449, published on 20 October 2008. This did not mark the end of developments in environmental regulation in Ecuador. For instance, on 23 March 2009 the Ministry of the Environment issued Ministerial Agreement No. 14 which established the procedure for environmental licensing of hydrocarbon operations in Ecuador (see 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, Appendix B).\n\n70.\n\nAs a result of these developments, the legal regime in Ecuador recognises the protection of the environment as a fundamental constitutional imperative. The 2008 Constitution is the culmination of forty years of evolving Ecuadorian Constitutions and laws which have systematically included major environmental legal protections. It recognises nature itself as the subject of rights,112 this realised through the enshrinement of environmental principles of prevention and precaution,113 the right of the Ecuadorian people to a healthy environment,114 a broad notion of environmental harm, the doctrine of strict liability and the State's obligation to take prompt policies and measures to prevent environmental damage.115\n\nExhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, Chapter Seven, Article 71: \"Nature, or *Pacha Mama*, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes. All persons, communities, peoples and nations can call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature. To enforce and interpret these rights, the principles set forth in the Constitution shall be observed, as appropriate. |.|.\"\n\nSee, for e.g., Article 73 of Exhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution: \"The State shall apply preventive and restrictive measures on activities that might lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems and the permanent alteration of natural cycles. The introduction of organisms and organic and inorganic material that might definitively alter the nation's genetic assets is forbidden.\" And Article 90 of the 1978 Hydrocarbons Law: \"Fixing the amount of compensation: Compensation to be paid for the damage caused to land, crops, buildings or other property, due to exploration or development of oil exploitation, or any other phase of the hydrocarbon industries, shall be fixed by experts designated by the parties. In the case of disagreement, the Minister shall appoint an umpire.\" (unofficial translation) Original: *Fijaci\u00f3n del monto de las indemnizaciones - Las indemnizaciones que se deban pagar por los perjuicios ocasionados en terrenos, cultivos, edificios u otros bienes, con motivo de la exploraci\u00f3n o el desarrollo de la explotacti\u00f3n petrolera, o de cualquier otra fase de las industrias de hidrocarburos, ser\u00e1n fijadas por peritos designadoes por las partes.

It extends to the requirement to notify the State of any spills of more than five barrels of oil,117 the submission of remediation plans and the regular monitoring of air, water and soil quality against specific regulatory standards.118\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 103; 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 6(a), 7-17.\n\nSee Exhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Article 16 cf. Ecuador drew the Tribunal's attention to an exchange of correspondence between the Consortium and the Ministry of Mines and Oil in December 2008: Letter from the Ministry of Mines and Oil to the Consortium dated 5 December 2008: \"In order to clarify what is described in the second paragraph of your letter, you are informed that a Socio-Environmental Evaluation is required for all spills, whether they exceed or not the threshold of five barrels.\" (Unofficial translation of Spanish original), E-252.

A regulatory framework shall be established for its protection and sustainable use to prevent its degradation, in particular as a result of pollution, desertification, and erosion. In areas affected by processes of degradation and desertification, the State shall develop and promote forestation, reforestation, and revegation projects that avoid single-crop farming and preferably use native species adapted to the area.\"130\n\nExhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, pp 126-127 of PDF.\n\nExhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, p 126 of PDF. For water, the relevant provision is Article 411 of the 2008 Constitution: \"The State shall guarantee the conservation, recovery and complete management of water resources and ecological flows associated with the water cycle. Any activity that may affect the quality and amount of water and the equilibrium of ecosystems shall be regulated, particularly in water replenishment sources and zones.\" (unofficial translation).\n\n76.\n\nAs noted above, Ecuador submitted that under the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution oil operators in Ecuador are subject to a regime of strict liability for environmental harm and are required to undertake the costs of remediation in full.131 Ecuador directed the Tribunal's attention to Articles 395 and 396 of the Constitution which provide as follows:\n\n**Article 395**.- The Constitution recognizes the following environmental principles:\n\n1. The State shall guarantee a sustainable model of development, one that is environmentally balanced and respectful of cultural diversity, conserves biodiversity and the natural regeneration capacity of ecosystems, and ensures meeting the needs of present and future generations.\n\n2. Environmental management policies shall be applied and shall be of mandatory enforcement by the State at all of its levels and by all individuals or legal entities in this country's territory.\n\n3. The State shall guarantee the active and standing participation of affected persons, communities, peoples and nations in the planning, implementation and monitoring of all activities causing environmental impacts.\n\n4. In the event of doubt concerning the scope of the legal provisions as regards environmental issues, their most favorable interpretation for the protection of nature shall obtain.132\n\n**Article 396**.- The State shall adopt timely policies and measures to avoid adverse environmental impacts where there is certainty about the damage. Should there be any doubt regarding the environmental impact stemming from an action or omission, although there is no scientific evidence of the damage, the State shall adopt effective and timely measures of protection.\n\nLiability for environmental damage is strict. Any harm to the environment, in addition to the corresponding penalties, shall also give rise to an obligation to fully restore the ecosystems and compensate the individuals and communities affected.\n\nEach of the participants in the production, distribution, commercialization and usage processes of goods and services shall be directly liable for preventing any environmental impact, mitigating and repairing the damages it has caused, and for maintaining a permanent environmental monitoring system.\n\nThe legal proceedings to prosecute and punish those responsible for environmental damages shall be imprescriptible.133\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraphs 12-23; EL-89, 2008 Constitution.\n\nEL-89, 2008 Constitution p 122 of PDF (Chapter 2, Biodiversity and Natural Resources, Chapter 1, Nature and the Environment).\n\nEL-89, 2008 Constitution, p 123 of PDF. Ecuador further relied on Article 11(3) of the Constitution, emphasising that it provided that its provisions were of \"direct and immediate application\". \"The rights and guarantees set forth in the Constitution and in human rights international instruments shall be of direct and immediate application by and before any public servant, administrative or judicial, *ex officio* or upon request by a party.\" (Unofficial translation from Spanish original: \"[l] *os derechos y garant\u00edas establecidos en la Constituci\u00f3n y en los instrumentos internacionales de derechos humanos ser\u00e1n de directa e inmediata aplicaci\u00f3n por y ante cualquier servidora o servidor p\u00fablico, administrativo o judicial, de oficio o a petici\u00f3n de parte* \"). (Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 12-23).\n\n77.\n\nEcuador submitted that Article 396, in particular paragraph 3 thereof, established a strict liability regime which placed the burden on the operator to prove that any environmental harm was caused by another person in order for the operator be exonerated from its own responsibility.134 Ecuador asserted that the operator was required to prove that the harm was caused \"exclusively\" by another person.135\n\nCounter-Memorial, section 8.1.2; Reply, sections 3.3.3 and 3.3.4.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 30-32 (Opening Statement of Pierre Mayer).\n\n78.\n\nThe import of these provisions and the Parties' submissions relating thereto will be examined in greater detail below. It suffices to note for present purposes that with regard to the remedy sought by Ecuador in this proceeding, its submission is that since Perenco has left the Blocks and is as such no longer in a position to \"restore [its] ecosystems\" as required by Article 396, paragraph 2, Ecuador is entitled to claim monetary damages in lieu from Perenco.136\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraphs 47-48.\n\n**(2) The Environmental Management Law**\n----------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Environmental Management Law (*Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental*) was enacted on 30 July 1999 to implement certain environmental principles adopted by the 1998 Constitution, such as sustainable development137 and the liability of State agencies and concessionaries for environmental harm.138\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, Chapter 1.\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 14-15; Exhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, Article 12, p 16 of PDF.\n\n80.\n\nArticle 1 of the Law explains that it \"establishes the principles and guidelines of environmental policy, determines the obligations, responsibilities, levels of participation of the public and private sectors in environmental management and indicates the permissible limits, controls and sanctions in this matter.\"139 Chapter I refers to sustainable development and the obligations of State institutions in environmental protection and regulation.140 Chapter II addresses generally the regulation of environmental management systems in Ecuador,141 for example, \"requir[ing] environmental impact studies\" as a prerequisite for issuing an environmental license.142 It also includes a glossary of definitions.143 \"Contamination\" is defined as \"[t]he presence in the environment of substances, elements or energies or a combination of them, in concentrations and duration superior or inferior to those established in the legislation in force.\"144 The Law's definitions of \"environmental harm\" and \"environmental impact\" are discussed below.\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law.\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, pp 16-17: \"Article 12(b)... Carry out and verify compliance with the norms on environmental quality, permissibility and fixation of technological levels and those that the competent Ministry may establish.\" (unofficial translation)\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, defined in its glossary as \"[t]he body of closely linked policies, norms, operative and administrative activities of planning, financing and control that must be carried out by the State and society to guarantee sustainable development and the optimal quality of life.\" (p 18 of PDF).\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, Article 22, p 17 of PDF.\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, p 18 of PDF.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n81.\n\nOne of Ecuador's legal experts, Professor Ricardo Crespo Plaza, explained that the Environmental Management Law was inspired by the content of international instruments relating to environmental protection, such as the Rio Declaration, which, according to Article 3 of the Law, is a \"guiding instrument for Ecuador's environmental policy.\"145 Ecuador relied on the Environmental Management Law in its submissions in support of a broad definition of the term \"environmental harm\" (addressed below).146 Perenco's legal expert, Dr. Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, asserted that \"[t]he regulations and ministerial accords issued in order to regulate the Environmental Management Law, together with other previously issued regulations, were compiled in TULAS.\"147\n\n1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 46-47, Annex No. 12; see, for example, reference to it in Article 3 of the Environmental Management Law in Ecuador (Exhibit CA-CC-33, p 16 of PDF).\n\nReply, paragraphs 246-251.\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 15,\n\n82.\n\nThe precise relationship between RAOHE, TULAS and the Environmental Management Law is a matter of dispute between the Parties. For present purposes, the Tribunal notes that two provisions of the Environmental Management Law lie at the heart of this disagreement.148 They appear in its glossary and define the terms \"environmental harm\" and \"environmental impact\":\n\n**Environmental Harm**... - Any significant loss, diminution, detriment or impairment of the preexisting conditions in the environment or one of its components. It affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its resources.\n\n**Environmental Impact**... - The positive or negative alteration of the environment, provoked directly or indirectly by a project or an activity in a given area.149\n\nReply, paragraphs 246-248; Rejoinder, paragraphs 37-41.\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, p 18 of PDF. The Parties do not disagree on the English translation of these definitions: see Reply, paragraph 246 and Rejoinder, paragraphs 37-38.\n\n83.\n\nThe crux of the Parties' dispute is whether: (i) an operator which stays within the limits prescribed by the regulations may create an impact upon the environment which leaves it in a different state from that which existed prior to the commencement of hydrocarbon operations, but such impact is nevertheless considered to be a permissible change and is not to be equated with an environmental harm and need not be remediated because it is an accepted and sustainable environmental cost of exploiting hydrocarbons (Perenco's position); or (ii) an operator that stays within the limits prescribed by the regulations may still create an impact on the environment which can also constitute an environmental harm which must be remediated (Ecuador's position). The Tribunal will revert to this disagreement in the course of its analysis.\n\n**(3) RAOHE**\n-------------\n\n84.\n\nRAOHE contains 14 chapters and 6 annexes addressing many aspects of oil operations that could have an impact on the environment.150 It obliges operators to submit environmental programmes and audits to the relevant Ministry (initially the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and subsequently, the Ministry of Non-Renewable Natural Resources, and more recently, the Ministry of the Environment), to undertake regular internal environmental monitoring and to identify and report environmental incidents and propose remediation programmes. In so doing, operators are required to apply \"parameters, maximum benchmark values and permissible limits\" as set out in detail in RAOHE's Annex II.151 Article 86 of RAOHE provides \"[f]or liquid discharges, atmospheric emissions and disposal of soil waste to the environment, the subjects of control and their operators and related parties in the implementation of their operations shall comply with the permissible limits specified in Annexes Nos. 1, 2 and 3 to this Regulation.Should a permissible limit established in the annexes be exceeded, this must be reported immediately to the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, and the corrective actions taken must be justified.\"152\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE.\n\nSee, for e.g., Article 86 of RAOHE (Exhibit EL-147, RAOHE, pp 45-46).\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\n85.\n\nAnnex II comprises six tables (Tables 3 to 8) spelling out permissible limits or benchmark values, such as for \"atmospheric emissions\" (Table 3), for \"waters and liquids discharges\" in the exploration and production process (Table 4), for \"discharges of black and gray waters\" (Table 5), for the \"identification and remediation of contaminated soils in all phases of the hydrocarbon industry\" (Table 6), for leachates \"for the final diposal of drilling muds and cuttings on the surface\" (Table 7), and finally, specifying the criteria for the classification of waste from hydrocarbon operations and recommendations for their treatment and disposal (Table 8).153\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\n86.\n\nRAOHE's Table 6 establishes different applicable criteria according to three types of land use: industrial, agricultural and sensitive ecosystems.154 Its logic is that the limits of permissible contamination are *most* stringent for sensitive ecosystems, *least* stringent for industrial areas, and agricultural lands fall *in the middle*... Footnotes to each of the different type of land use state that the \"agricultural land\" use criteria is \"focused on the protection of soils and crops\", \"industrial land\" use criteria is intended \"for industrial sites (buildings, etc.)\" and \"sensitive ecosystems\" criteria is for \"the protection of sensitive ecosystems such as the National Heritage of Natural Areas and others identified in the corresponding Environmental Study.\"155\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, p 57.\n\n*Ibid.* (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013)\n\n87.\n\nTable 6 states that the \"permissible limits to be applied in a determined project depend on the subsequent use (*uso posterior*) to be given to the remediated soil.\"156 The Parties dispute the meaning of the word \"posterior\" in the context of RAOHE.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\n88.\n\nAs Chart I below shows, depending upon the classification of the land in question, different parameters relating to total hydrocarbons, polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons, cadmium, nickel and lead are to be used in order to determine whether soil is contaminated:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **CHART I** **RAOHE Table 6157** |\n| Parameter | Expressed | Unit(1) | Agricultural | Industrial | Sensitive |\n|  | in |  | Use(2) | Use(3) | Ecosystems(4) |\n| Total hydrocarbons | TPH | Mg/kg | <2500 | <4000 | <1000 |\n| Polycyclic aromatic | C | Mg/kg | <2 | <5 | <1 |\n| Hydrocarbons |  |  |  |  |  |\n| (PAH\u2019s) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Cadmium | cd | Mg/kg | ***<2*** | <10 | <1 |\n| Nickel | Ni | Mg/kg | *<50* | <100 | <40 |\n| Lead | Pb | Mg/kg | <100 | <500 | <80 |\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, p 57.\n\n89.\n\nThe classification of land usage is not the only possible criterion for judging which parameter applies. Certain substances generated in oilfield activities may also be naturally present in the soil of the area being exploited. For that reason, in the second introductory paragraph to RAOHE's Table 6 it is stated that \"[i]f natural (non-contaminated) soils in the area *present concentrations higher than the established limits*, the values of the respective parameter may be increased to this level, so long as this phenomenon has been statistically verified through monitoring of undisturbed and uninfluenced soils in the same area.\"158\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013) [emphasis added].\n\n90.\n\nRAOHE's Table 7 establishes the permissible limits for the \"final disposal on the surface\" of \"drilling muds and cuttings\" that contain \"leachates.\"159 Its introductory paragraph explains that the permissible limits \"depen[d] on whether or not the final disposal site has impermeabilization of the base.\"160 For example, the maximum permissible limit for barium is 5 mg/l where the storage site lacks bottom sealing, but 10 mg/l if the site has a sealed bottom.161 This differential treatment depends on whether the operator laid a proper containment barrier in the bottom of the mud pit prior to disposing of drilling muds in the pit. It also requires that any sampling that is carried out in this respect to be conducted \"so as to obtain representative composite samples as a function of total volume disposed of at the respective site.\"162 RAOHE further mandates that the operator must comply with specific operational procedures and requirements in disposing of drilling muds and test crude.163 The contents of any mud pit must be treated until it complies with the permissible limits of Table 7 and a follow-up by means of periodic sampling is required within seven days, three months and six months of storage.164\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\n*Ibid.* (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013) Ecuador contended in this regard that Table 7 seeks to determine whether there is a significant risk of the contaminants within a pit leaching and infiltrating the surrounding area but that it must be applied together with Table 6 which determines whether the internal soil content of the pits is in fact contaminated: Reply, section 3.1.5.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, p 58.\n\n*Ibid.* (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Article 52.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Table 7 (p 57) and Article 52(d).2.3.\n\n91.\n\nAnnex 5 of RAOHE, entitled \"Analytical Method\", contains a table setting out, as its title suggests, the analytical testing methods to be applied when investigating water quality (also, soil and atmospheric emissions).165 It has three columns, the first identifying the parameter (electrical conductivity, potential hydrogen, etc.); the second indicating the method (i.e., determination of electrical conductivity by calibration at two electrode points); and the third noting the relevant reference material (i.e., publications).166 For example, testing whether barium, chromium, lead or vanadium exceeds the applicable parameter requires filtration and acidification using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy.167\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Annex 5, p 65 of PDF. For soil, it identifies as the method of sampling: \"Composite representative sample (minimum 15 to 20 subsamples by hectare or equivalent, homogenising)\" (unofficial translation).\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Annex 5, pp 65-66 of PDF.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, p 65 of PDF (unofficial translation): \" *Filtraci\u00f3n acidificaci\u00f3n de la muestra, determinaci\u00f3n directa por espectroscopia de absorbci\u00f3n at\u00f3mica (AAS)* \".\n\n92.\n\nRAOHE further requires that operators must undertake certain environmental programmes and audits. Article 10 requires operators to submit annual environmental programmes and budgets to the Ministry.168 An operator is also required to commission an environmental impact study before the commencement of any new project, such study to be submitted to and approved by the Ministry.169 Operators are required to submit annual environmental reports that \"describe and evaluate the budgeted environmental activities that have been performed.\"170 The Ministry is empowered to request at any time additional reports on specific activities undertaken by the operator.171 Article 12 requires regular internal environmental monitoring of emissions, liquid and solid discharges, and soils undergoing remediation, the sampling points and results of which are to be submitted to the Ministry on a monthly basis when the operator is in the process of drilling a well, and otherwise on a quarterly basis.172 Article 16 of RAOHE obliges operators to report spills of more than five barrels of crude or combustibles to the Ministry, mandating that they should submit remediation plans for all affected areas, including a final remediation report, to the Ministry for its approval.173\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, pp 3-4 of PDF.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Arts 13. 34, 35, 37, 48, 51, 55, 63, 70, 75, 84; 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 20; examples of EIS's undertaken by the Consortium can be found at Exhibits CE-CC-52, Complementary Environmental Impact Study to the EIS for the Development and Production Phase in Oso Field -Block 7, Project: Drilling of Development Wells Oso 3-4-5, March 2003 and CE-CC-71, Reevaluation of the Environmental Impact Study/Environmental Management Plan for the Development and Production Phase of the Yuralpa Field - Block 21, Project: Installation of a Water Injection Line to the Nemoca 1 Well, June 2004.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Article 11.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Article 12.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Article 16. Article 16 uses the phrase \"five barrels\". The interpretation of this requirement was a matter of dispute between the Parties. Ecuador submitted that the operator was required to report all spills, and not just spills of more than five barrels (Reply, paragraph 49). Perenco submitted that \"the Consortium's practice was to report even more minor spills whenever those spills left the immediate confines of the platform. In fact, over 40% of all the spills reported to the Ministry during the Consortium's operatorship -specifically, nine out of 22 total - consisted of volumes under five barrels.\" (Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 134 cf. Rejoinder, paragraphs 299-302).\n\n93.\n\nIn addition, all operators are also required to commission a comprehensive environmental audit at least once every two years, such audit to be conducted by an auditor and on such terms as approved by the Ministry:174\n\n**ART. 42. - Environmental Audit.** - The Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, through the National Environmental Protection Directorate, shall audit, at least every two years, or whenever the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection so orders upon detecting noncompliance with the Environmental Management Plan, the environmental aspects of the various hydrocarbons activities conducted by the subjects of control [sic].\n\nThe Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, through the National Environmental Protection Directorate (DINAPA), shall determine the type and scope of the Environmental Audit for the operations of the subjects of control based on compliance with the Environmental Management Plan.\n\nAt least every two years, the subjects of control shall conduct an Environmental Audit of their activities, following approval of the corresponding Terms of Reference by the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, and they shall submit the respective audit report to the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection.\n\nAdditionally, the parties, upon the termination of hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation, or in the event of a change of operator, shall conduct the audit referenced in Art. 11 of the Regulation to Law 44, amending the Hydrocarbons Law..\n\nFor purposes of the aforementioned audits, the subjects of control shall select an environmental auditor qualified by the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection to carry out the monitoring and verification of compliance with the Environmental Management Plan, in accordance with the Terms of Reference previously approved by the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, in which the documentary framework is determined against which the audit shall be conducted.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Article 42. (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\n94.\n\nPerenco submitted that it \"consistently complied with government regulations\", \"obtain[ing] both prior and often *ex post* approvals for all activities that could potentially affect the environment or alter the infrastructure of the Blocks\" and performing all necessary environmental audits.175 Moreover, \"whenever an incident occurred that affected the environment, the Consortium promptly notified the State, performed all required repairs, remediation and cleanup, and obtained the State's approval of the remediation.\"176 Notably, Perenco relied on the Consortium's practice of producing remediation plans and reports that applied the criteria in Tables 6 and 7 of RAOHE to support its submission that those tables provided the relevant remediation criteria that should be applied in this claim.177\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 119-132, 140-144; 1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 14-24. Perenco submitted that it complied with its obligation to contract independent environmental audits of the Blocks every two years, and provided them to the Ministry for approval: see Exhibits CE-CC-137 Letter of March 23, 2002 from Efficacitas to Perenco, attaching 2002 Environmental Audit of Block 21 (2002 environmental audit of Block 21); CE-CC-182, Biannual Environmental Audit of Block 7 and Coca-Payamino Unified Field, Two Years Prior to the Expiration of the Block 7 Participation Contract, November 2008 (2008 environmental audit of Block 7).\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 120, 133-139.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 137.\n\n95.\n\nIn Ecuador's view, Perenco's position is \"flatly contradicted\" by the discovery of \"widespread, undisclosed and non-remediated contamination throughout the oilfield facilities operated by the Consortium up to July 2009.\"178 There were, in Ecuador's view, \"numerous and significant failures by the Consortium to comply with the applicable Ecuadorian regulations\", this made out on the basis of the documents on record in this arbitration, such as the environmental audit reports commissioned by the Consortium in 2002, 2006 and 2008, correspondence with the Ministry, and internal documents prepared by the Consortium.179 Ecuador went so far as to assert that there was evidence that the \"Consortium actively sought to conceal environmental incidents from the Ecuadorian authorities.\"180\n\nReply, section 2.1.1.1.\n\nReply, paragraph 37, relying on RPS ER III, section 6.\n\nReply, section 2.1.1.2.\n\n96.\n\nFinally, it asserted that the criteria in RAOHE were not comprehensive; there were other chemical indicators and heavy metals associated with hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation that were not covered by RAOHE, such as electrical conductivity, pH, barium and vanadium,181 and the Consortium's past interpretation of the applicable regulatory criteria cannot determine conclusively the criteria that Ecuadorian law mandates be applied in an action for remediation of environmental damage.182\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 167.\n\nExpert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraph 16.\n\n**(4) TULAS**\n-------------\n\n97.\n\nEcuador submitted that TULAS is relevant to the analysis of soil and groundwater remediation under Ecuadorian law.183 It supported the basis for its Base Values case and was to be applied together with RAOHE.184 This was because it addresses chemical indicators and heavy metals associated with hydrocarbon operations that are not included in RAOHE, such as electrical conductivity, pH, barium and vanadium.185 It also provided that environmental audits could not be used to exonerate an operator in an action for environmental damage.186\n\nExhibit EL-146, TULAS; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 164 and footnote 27.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraphs 164, 166-167 and footnote 27: (paragraph 167): \"It is important to note, however, that both the RAOHE and the TULAS expressly acknowledge that the Base Values may differ from the thresholds set in the regulations.\"\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 166.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraphs 38-43, referring to Article 70 of TULAS (addressed in further detail in the summary of the Parties' submissions below).\n\n98.\n\nFor his part, Perenco's expert, Dr. Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, asserted that TULAS is applied in a \"general manner to all of those activities that may cause an impact that requires environmental authorisation\", adding that \"activities that have a *specific* regulation due to their subject matter *, such as those for hydrocarbons*, mining or telecommunications, must be carried out pursuant to said specific regulation and resort to the regulations of TULAS *only in the absence of a specific regulation*, in which case TULAS will be applied in a *supplementary* manner.\"187\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, Appendix B, paragraph 5(a) [Emphasis added.].\n\n99.\n\nTULAS also created a Single Environmental Management System which \"contains the guidelines for the environmental impact evaluation procedure and implementation of the Decentralized Environmental Management System\" and established the \"State's obligation to perform environmental oversight of the regulated entities in order to ensure compliance with the environmental management plans pursuant to what is established in the environmental license or permit.\"188\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, Appendix B, paragraph 5(b).\n\n100.\n\nAs with other issues of law, there is a difference of opinion between the Parties as to the precise relationship of TULAS to RAOHE. Ecuador considered that TULAS set forth \"the rules for the evaluation of environmental impact from a technical perspective.189 Perenco did not share this view; it submitted that RAOHE's requirements and parameters trumped \"more general regulations such as [TULAS], except where the [RAOHE] is silent.\"190 In short, Ecuador gives greater prominence to TULAS then Perenco does; for Perenco, RAOHE is the primary source of regulation, with TULAS applying only in a backup or gap-filling manner.\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, footnote 564; Supplemental Memorial, footnote 27 (in contrast to RAOHE, which Ecuador described as \"regulatory provisions in relation to the procedure for evaluating environmental impacts that arise from hydrocarbon operations\").\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 108.\n\n101.\n\nTable 2, Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS, entitled \u2018Soil Quality Standards', sets out non-site specific standards for the background values of 36 different elements that may be present in soil. Article 4.2.1 explains that Table 2 sets out the quality criteria for soil, defining this as \"approximate background values or analytical detection limits for pollutants in the soil\", \"reflect[ing] the natural geological variations of undeveloped areas or areas free of the influence of generalized industrial or urban activities.\"191 Ecuador relied on Table 2 in its alternative regulatory case as containing the applicable criteria for substances not included in Table 6 of the RAOHE, namely electrical conductivity, pH, barium and vanadium.192\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Excerpt of Table 2, Annex 2 of Book VI of TULAS193** |\n| **Substance** | **Unit** | **Soil** |\n| Electrical conductivity | mmhos/cm | 2 |\n| pH | mmhos/cm | 6 to 8 |\n| Barium | mg/kg | 200 |\n| Vanadium | mg/kg | 25 |\n| Total Chromium | mg/kg | 20 |\n\nSee above at paragraphs 74-76, Exhibit EL-146, TULAS (unofficial translation) (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013); (original) \" ***4.2.1 Criterios de Calidad del Suelo***  *Los criterios de calidad, son valores de fondo aproximados o l\u00edmites anal\u00edticos de detecci\u00f3n para un contaminante en el suelo. para los prop\u00f3sitos de esta Norma, los valores de fondo se refieren a los niveles ambientales representativos para un contaminante en el suelo.

But it would not be liable for pre-existing \"environmental conditions\" (for Block 7, this referred to conditions that pre-existed the Service Contract; for Block 21, this referred to conditions that pre-existed the Participation Contract). Clause 5.1.20, opening paragraph, subsections (9), (10) and 5.1.21 of the Block 7 Contract and Clause 5.1.19 and 5.1.20 of the Block 21 Contract provided:\n\n**[Block 7] Obligations of the Contractor** : Without prejudice to the other obligations contained in this Contract, the Contractor is obliged to:\n\n**5.1.20** Preserve the existing ecological equilibrium in the Contract Area, to which end keeping all its activities within the pertinent standards in force in the country and on the basis of the Environmental Impact Studies, as stated in Annex No. XI...\n\n**5.1.20.9** Employ qualified personnel, equipment, machinery, materials, operational procedures and, in general, technology which complies with environmental protection standards and practices used in the international hydrocarbons industry, without prejudice to compliance with existing standards in the country.\n\n**5.1.20.10** Take responsibility for the cleanup and reforestation of the area with species similar to those originally found at the site, in order to, with time, allow the potential return to environmental conditions similar to those encountered at the beginning of the operations; also take responsibility for the abandonment of wells and installations for which the Contractor has been responsible as a consequence of the execution of this Contract. Said cleanup, reforestation and return to similar conditions and abandonment activities shall be performed in accordance with the Environmental Regulation for Hydrocarbon Operations and the Environmental Impact Study.

Clause 5.1.9 required Perenco to \"provide the Ministry of Energy and Mines with the original and PETROECUADOR with copies of all technical information...including those of a scientific, environmental and technical nature...\".217 Clause 5.1.18 required the company to \"perform an Environmental Impact Study for the seismic prospection phase within the first six months following the Effective Date.

These studies shall be the basis for socioenvironmental audits that must be conducted periodically by the Ministry of Energy and Mines to ensure that the Contractor's operations are being carried out with the least impact on human residential populations and the environment.\"218 Clause 5.5.5 referred to a comprehensive environmental audit that had to be commissioned two years before the expiry of the Block 21 Contract.219\n\nExhibit CE-10/CE-CC-13, Block 21 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04655.\n\nExhibit CE-10/CE-CC-13, Block 21 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04654.\n\nExhibit CE-10/CE-CC-13, Block 21 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04666.\n\n114.\n\nThe Block 7 Contract included a reference to an environmental impact study that the first contractor was required to complete and submit to SPA for approval as a pre-condition for entry into the Contract. Clause 5.1.20.3 stated that \"[a]s of the Effective Date of this Contract, the Contractor has completed the Environmental Impact Studies described in Annex Number XI, and these studies have been submitted and approved by the Undersecretary of the Environment of the relevant Ministry.\"220 This provision does not appear in the Block 21 Contract.\n\nExhibit CE-17/CE-CC-28, Block 7 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04765.\n\n**C. The Parties' Submissions on the Legal Issues**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThere was sharp divergence between the Parties on several areas regarding the application of Ecuadorian law and Perenco's obligations under the Participation Contracts.\n\n**(1) Strict Versus Fault-based Liability**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Parties diverged on whether the regime that governed the counterclaim was fault or strict liability based. They also disagreed on the precise way in which the regime that pre-dated the 2008 Constitution operated, and the circumstances in which the regime of the 2008 Constitution would apply.\n\n117.\n\nEcuador submitted that for a claim brought after the Constitution's entry into force, an oil operator was liable under the strict liability regime if the State established that environmental harm221 existed in the areas in which the operator undertook hydrocarbon activities.222 The burden then shifted to the operator to prove that the environmental damage was \"insignificant.\"223 Ecuador noted in this respect that the Constituent Assembly of Ecuador, during the drafting of the 2008 Constitution, referred to:\n\n\"A presumption of innocence [that] should be established in favor of the environment. From this perspective, the burden of proof must be shifted to the defendant...\"224\n\nA note on nomenclature: in the course of submissions the terms used ranged from \"damage\" or \"impact\" or \"alteration\" or \"harm\" (for e.g., see Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 27 (Opening Statement of Pierre Mayer).\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 664; Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 12-23; Reply, paragraph 7; 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 16, 26-41 cf.

Ecuador also relied on Article 11(3), first paragraph: \"The rights and guarantees set forth...shall be of direct and immediate application by and before any public servant, administrative or judicial ex officio or upon request by a party.\" 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraph 16 (\"[A] strict liability regime is established, the shift of the burden of proof and the imprescribable [sic] nature of actions to prosecute and punish environmental damage\").

See Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 41 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nReply, paragraph 317, referring to 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 37-41 and Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraph 33. Alternatively, Ecuador submitted that even if the relevant date was the date damage was caused, the strict liability regime of the 2008 Constitution would still apply since the cause of the damage did not cease until after its enactment (i.e. Perenco was operating in the Blocks after the Constitution entered into force in November 2008).\n\nReply, section 3.2.2, paragraph 326.\n\n121.\n\nProfessor Crespo explained that the basis of the strict liability regime in Ecuador is that Nature (\" *pacha mama* \") has rights, including the right to remediation,234 and the theory of risk, i.e., that \"the burden should go hand in hand with the economic benefit of an activity (*ubi emolumentum ibi onus*)\" such that \"whoever creates risk in his or her benefit must also suffer its harmful consequences.\"235 He referred in this latter respect to a 2002 ruling of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court, in *Delfina Torres v. Petroecuador*, which found that \"the production, industrialization, transportation and operation of hydrocarbon substances [were], undoubtedly, high-risk or high-dangerouness activities.\"236 He also relied on a report prepared by the Working Group on Natural Resources and Biodiversity in Ecuador, a committee of the Constituent Assembly that contributed to the drafting of the 2008 Constitution, which observed that:\n\n\"A presumption of innocence should be established in favor of the environment. From this perspective, the burden of proof must be shifted to the defendant (literal b of Article 1), that is, departing from the ancient principle according to which innocence is presumed until proven otherwise because, in environmental matters, strict liability would be the exception. The plaintiff will not be required to prove the causality link, which will fall on the defendant. This principle eliminates one of the barriers hindering access to environmental justice as is the cost of evidence and the technical requirement of proving environmental harm.\"237\n\n1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 16 and 25 (\"The public policy nature of the norms of protection of the environment in Ecuador is particularly true in the case of Articles 396 and 297 of the Constitution.\").\n\n1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 27-28, 30-31, 39-40 and 86; see also, Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 26 (Opening Statement of Pierre Mayer), lines 1-4 (\"he who receives the profits must also bear the burden of the risk associated to the profit\"); lines 11-18 (\"He who created the risk and received the profit should bear the negative consequences, instead of externalizing them, as the tenets of law in economics would say, to the society at large\").\n\n1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 27-28, 30-31, 39-40 and 86; Supreme Court of Justice Case No. 229-220 at EL-145. See also, Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraphs 53-58. Professor Andrade also relied on the decision of Ecuador's former Supreme Court of Justice in the case of *Andrade Medina v.

Article 70 states that \"[t]he approval of environmental management plans and other environmental studies shall not be used as exonerating evidence in environmental contamination incidents or accidents attributable to any activity, project or construction[..]\".261 Ecuador also relied on Article 11(6), paragraph 1 of the 2008 Constitution which states that \"[a]ll [its] principles and rights are inalienable, *unwaivable*, indivisible, interdependent.\".262 Moreover, the technical inspection was held out by Ecuador as \"no less than the 2008 Environmental Audits review process itself\" and it determined that \u2018approval' would not be forthcoming because \"none of the [audits] complied with the Consortium's obligations.\"263\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraphs 103-113; Reply, section 3.1.3.\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 656, 687-688; Reply, paragraph 280; Exhibit EL-146, TULAS (as translated by Ecuador at paragraph 690 of its Counter-Memorial).\n\nExhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution [Emphasis added.]; Reply, paragraph 279.\n\nReply, paragraph 373; Exhibit E-176, Technical Inspection Report.\n\n129.\n\nEcuador submitted that, in any event, the 2008 audits were unreliable because they examined whether the Consortium complied with permissible limits under RAOHE and TULAS but as discussed in detail below, these limits did not amount to the extent of recoverable environmental harm for which Perenco may now be held liable.264 Furthermore, Perenco selectively sampled areas of the Blocks that it knew would be less likely to display contamination, taking far fewer samples than that reasonably required for a credible and representative sampling program.265\n\nReply, paragraphs 282-286 (\"In sum, the Consortium's audits could be relied upon - though it is not their aim - to establish the existence of environmental harm because any contamination above the permissible limits implies environmental harm *per se*... However, they cannot be used to establish the inexistence of environmental harm.\").\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 687, 755, 757, 758, 780 (\"a mere 12 days of field work\"), 795 (\"based on a mere 14 soil samples...decided not to collect and test any underground water sample in Blocks 7 and 21\"); see also, 1st Witness Statement of Marco Puente, paragraph 19: \"[A] former Perenco employee, Mr. Marco Puente, describes how the audits were taken by Perenco for sampling to carefully select sites where there was no or little pollution, or that had been previously remediated.\" (quoting from Counter-Memorial, paragraph 796).\n\n130.\n\nEcuador contended that Perenco's culpability was compounded by its efforts to \"systematically [\u2026] mislead the Ecuadorian authorities as to the existence and extent of the environmental damages.\"266 For example, it referred to an internal memorandum within Perenco regarding a February 2010 complaint by a local landowner about contamination in the Payamino 2-8 area.267 Perenco's memorandum discussed the extent to which different individuals or organisations connected to the investigation were aware of the contamination and the \"possible solutions\" available to the company (for example, submitting an action plan to remedy the damage and compensate; \"confine the problem and leave the site as is\", and finally, to contest liability).268 Ecuador emphasised the disparity between the results of an initial study of the site conducted by Gr\u00fcntech laboratory, which concluded that the oil spill that caused the contamination occurred during the time Perenco was the operator, and that of a technical study conducted by Walsh Environmental Scientists and Engineers which reached a conclusion similar to that put forward by Perenco to the Ministry, namely, that the contamination resulted from the disposal of waste coming from the drilling of the Payamino 2 well by CEPE in April 1987, and to a lesser extent, an oil spill that occurred in January 1998 when *Petroproducci\u00f3n* operated the field.269\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 656, section 8.2.2; Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 87-101.\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 742-746; see Exhibit E-169, Letter from Mr. Daniel Jungal to Perenco dated 23 February 2010; Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 93-101.\n\nSee Exhibit E-170, Memorandum prepared by Perenco on the characterization of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8 (*Caracterizaci\u00f3n de Pendientes Ambientales Payamino 2-8*) in May 2010; Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 744-749. In its Counter-Memorial, Ecuador characterises the subsequent statement prepared by Perenco and submitted to the Minister of Environment on 11 June 2010, and a technical study it commissioned by Walsh Environmental Scientists and Engineers as part of a pattern of conduct to conceal information and disclaim liability for possible contamination in the Blocks (see Exhibit E-163, *Informe T\u00e9cnico: Caracterizaci\u00f3n del Pasivo* *Ambiental Adyacente a la Plataforma Payamino 2-8 - Campo Unificado Coca-Payamino* (\"Walsh Technical Report\"), dated October 2010).\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 100; Exhibit E-163, Walsh Technical Report.\n\n131.\n\nEcuador adverted to other examples of similar behavior, such as Perenco's representation to the Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment in 2010 that no oil spills had ever been reported on or near the Payamino 2 and 8 wells while Block 7 was under Perenco's operatorship270, an assertion that was contradicted in its report to DINAPA in 2004 that 9 oil spills in Blocks 7 and 21 had occurred between 2000 and 2003.271 Ecuador alleged that Perenco had failed to report at least 42 spills that occurred during its operatorship that now appeared on the record in this proceeding.272\n\nSee Exhibit E-161, Letter from Perenco to the Minister of Environment dated 11 June 2010. The Tribunal notes that while Perenco in its letter does represent that it \"carried out an exhaustive review of its archives and verified that during their operation there ha[d] never been a spill\", it follows on to clarify that it did discover what appeared to be an \"old oil spill\" and inferred that it must have occurred during the time of Kerr McGee or Petroproducci\u00f3n.\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 736-737; Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 88-90; Exhibit E-162, Letter from Perenco to the DINAPA dated 20 January 2004 (with a summary of oil spills, at least 6 of which seem from their description to have taken place in or about the Coca-Payamino fields). Ecuador relies in addition on the Walsh Technical Report, which, while it suggests that oil spills did occur, it also concluded that \"[t]here are no references to the existence of any Environmental Liability in the area of influence of the Payamino 2-8 Platform\" see Exhibit E-163, p 35). See also, examples Ecuador raises of complaints by local inhabitants at exhibits E-164 to E-166, and Exhibit E-172, *Perenco ou les tribulations d\u2018un p\u00e9trolier fran\u00e7ais en Equateur*, Mediapart.fr, 26 April 2009.\n\nReply, paragraphs 44-51, referring to GSI ER I, Appendix B.3 and 2nd Witness Statement of Manuel Solis, paragraph 76.\n\n132.\n\nEcuador similarly raised instances where DINAPA, after having reviewed evidence of site-testing by Perenco in areas where oil spills had been reported by local communities, concluded that the company's inspections were deliberately conducted in areas located a considerable distance from the sites in question, and for that reason, were unrepresentative of the conditions of the site of concern.273 It further raised examples of what it characterised as deliberate omissions by Perenco in its regular reporting to the DINAPA.274 It relied on RPS' expert report which concluded that based on the documents on record it could \"identif[y] numerous and significant failures by the Consortium to comply with Ecuadorian regulations.\"275\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraphs 90-91; see e.g., Exhibit E-167, Letter from DINAPA to Perenco dated 10 April 2008.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 738-740; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 92; see, for e.g., Exhibit E-168, Letter from DINAPA to Perenco dated 21 November 2006.\n\nReply, paragraph 360; RPS ER III, section 6 cf. e.g, in Rejoinder, paragraph 292 (contending that the claim that the Consortium diluted contaminants found in pits contrary to TULAS is incorrect because TULAS's prohibition on the use of water to dilute effluents was not in force at the time of the closure of the Coca 18 and Payamino 24 pits about which Ecuador complains).\n\n133.\n\nFinally, Ecuador submitted that the notion of harm covered by the Constitution's strict liability regime was broad, \"covering as many types of environmental harm as possible\" including \"affectation to hydric sources\", \"loss of vegetation\", \"loss of air quality\", \"affectation to health of local populations\", \"impact to the local economy\", \"socio-environmental conflicts\" and \"affectation to tangible and intangible cultural heritage.\"276 This contributed to the specific evaluative criteria that Ecuador submitted its environmental experts were required to apply when evaluating the state of Blocks 7 and 21 (discussed in further detail below in Section III.C(5)).\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 674-676; Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 26-28; 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 75-76.\n\n134.\n\nPerenco's position was that fault-based liability, *not* strict liability, governed Ecuador's environmental claim.277 In its view, strict liability was not the standard applicable under Ecuadorian law until the 2008 Constitution was adopted and to apply it to the Consortium's operations would be contrary to the principles of non-retroactivity and legal security.278 Ecuador's Civil Code applied to the Consortium's operations prior to October 2008, and the code provided that \"he who has committed a tort\", defined elsewhere as constituting an illegal action committed \"with the intention to cause harm\", which \"has caused harm to another\", is \"obligated to indemnify\".279 This required a \"breach of a duty of care which result[ed] in harm.\"280 Thus, Perenco's contention was that Ecuador's claims were deficient because it had failed to establish in IEMS' experts reports that the Consortium \"deliberately or negligently breached its duty of care\",281 and that it \" *caused* the alleged contamination.\"282\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 199 cf. Reply, section 3.3.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 199-205. Perenco relied on Article 7 of Ecuador's Civil Code, which states \"[t]he law does not provide but for what is to come; it has no retroactive effect.\" (Exhibit CA-CC-38) (translation resubmitted 10-16-2013) It also pointed to Article 82 of Ecuador's Constitution, which established the right to legal security, based upon \"the existence of prior legal regulations that are clear, public and applied by the competent authorities.\" (EL-89, 2008 Constitution) 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 79-81.\n\nExhibit CA-CC-38, Articles 2184 and 2214; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 200-201.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 201.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 22 [Italics in original], 196; Rejoinder, paragraphs 289-297.\n\nPerenco submitted that many of the incidents said to produce alleged contamination \"were in fact caused by Ecuador's own operation of the fields, either before the Consortium commenced operations or after Petroamazonas took over operations in July 2009.\" (Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 22).\n\n135.\n\nRelying on its own Ecuadorian law expert, Dr. Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, Perenco rejected Professor Crespo's reliance on *obiter dicta* from *Delfina Torres*283 to assert that in any event strict liability for environmental claims existed in Ecuador before October 2008, arguing that he had misinterpreted the decision.284 Dr. Bed\u00f3n stated that even as the Court in *Delfina Torres* shifted the burden of proof to the defendant, requiring it to prove that it had adopted appropriate measures to prevent the damage alleged by the claimant, it still required a finding of fault, albeit \"presumed fault.\"285 He asserted that:\n\n\"In that ruling, after reaffirming that \u2018it is *considered necessary to have a requirement of fault* for the sake of justice of those responsible', the Court made the following statement:\n\n\u2018However, since the burden of proof of such fault is almost impossible or very difficult to be borne by the victim, *shifting the burden of proof* was considered necessary...In other words, the *presumption of the fault* of the person using and taking advantage of the risky thing causing the harm was established. This theory has increasingly gained acceptance, particularly in case law...We fully agree with this position and such is the reason why we adopt it as foundation for this ruling...'.\"286\n\nExhibit EL-145, *Comit\u00e9 Pro Mejoras Barrio Delfina Torres vda. de Concha v.

Both the express text of those provisions and the very decision cited by Ecuador, *Andrade Medina*, confirm that this administrative liability regime applie[d] *only* to harm caused by the State or its public servants or agents.293\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 316 [Emphasis in original.].\n\n139.\n\nThus, Perenco submitted it is able to prove that it satisfied its duty of care, comprising the standard of care expected of a reasonably prudent operator,294 because it consistently complied with contractual and regulatory requirements to report, audit and remediate.295\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 498-504.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 498-504; Rejoinder, paragraphs 289-297 cf.

Reply, paragraphs 361-367.\n\n141.\n\nPerenco submitted that it was insufficient for Ecuador to allege there has been an *impact* in the environment of Blocks 7 and 21 in order to shift the burden to Perenco to offer proof of its insignificance.297 In its view, in the course of its submissions Ecuador had conceded that the burden rested on the claimant in an action for environmental liability in a strict liability regime to establish the existence of environmental harm.298 Referring to the testimony of Professor Crespo, as set out above, Ecuador's case at its highest is that it was required to \"only establish *the existence of the environmental damage* in Blocks 7 and 21, where Perenco operated\" for Perenco to be held liable.299 In its written pleadings, Ecuador contended it \"need only establish the *existence of the environmental damage* \" or \"that environmental harm *exists.* \"300 Ecuador could not retreat from this by claiming that Article 397(1) of the 2008 Constitution shifted the burden of proof to the Perenco to prove the inexistence of harm in such a way that it relieved Ecuador of the duty to first establish that harm actually exists.301\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 75-79 [Emphasis added.].\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 75-79.\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 654, 672 [Emphasis added.].\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 4 [Emphasis added.]; Ecuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 409 [Emphasis added.].\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 78; 242-251.\n\n142.\n\nFinally, on the issue of temporality, relying on Dr. Bed\u00f3n's report, Perenco maintained that the law which applied in an environmental claim was the law in force at the date of the occurrence of the act alleged to have caused harm, rather than the law in force at the point of time that the harm was purportedly discovered.302 Dr. Bed\u00f3n responded in this respect to Professor Crespo's view that the relevant date for determining Perenco's liability was November 2011, the time of IEMS' first inspection of the Blocks, and that since this followed the 2008 Constitution's entry into force, the Constitution's strict liability regime was engaged.303\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 77-82; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 206-210.\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 77-82 cf. 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 37-41; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 205-229.\n\n143.\n\nDr. Bed\u00f3n asserted that the principle on which he relied, namely, that \"the fact that determines the applicable law is the date of the *occurrence* of the act\", was validated by the statute of limitations rules governing torts in Ecuador, \"which establishe[d] that the statute of limitations is counted from the date *on which the allegedly harmful act occurred*.\"304 He referred in this respect to Article 2235 of Ecuador's Civil Code which provides for a \"statute of limitations of four years, *counted from the perpetration of the act*.\"305\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 208 [Italics in original]; see 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 78.\n\nExhibit CA-CC-38, Ecuadorian Civil Code, published in Official Registry No. 46 of June 24, 2005 (\"Civil Code\") [Emphasis added.]; 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 78.\n\n144.\n\nAny other approach, Perenco contended, would be contrary to the basic principle of nonretroactivity that exists under Ecuadorian law as accepted by Ecuador in the course of its submissions in this arbitration.306 It rejects any suggestion that an exception should be made on the basis that claims for environmental liability are advanced in the \"general interest of nature and the Ecuadorian general public.\"307 This is not a position provided for in Ecuador's 2008 Constitution or in any decisions of its courts.308 There is \"no basis on which to derogate from the express constitutional principle of non-retroactivity.\"309 Consequently, the strict liability regime of the 2008 Constitution should not be applied to conduct occurring prior to its entry into force on 20 October 2008.310\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 318-328.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 320; cf. Ecuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 336 and 338.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 321. Perenco argued against the authoritativeness of jurisprudence from other jurisdictions: Rejoinder, paragraphs 323-325.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 327.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 328.\n\n145.\n\nIn sum, Perenco argued that it could not be held liable for any damage occurring after the July 2009 takeover or before January 2007 (the furthest back in time that Ecuador's four-year statute of limitations permitted a claim to be made).311\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 21-24; 190-198.\n\n**(2) Burden of Proof in Relation to Causation**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Parties also diverged on the matter of causation. In light of Ecuador's position that the 2008 Constitution continued a strict liability regime that was already in force since 2002, it argued that while it bore the burden of presenting evidence of environmental \"impact\" in the Blocks, it was not, either prior to or after the 2008 Constitution, required to demonstrate that the defendant had caused the exceedances claimed in order for it to be found liable.312\n\nSee, for e.g., Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 21 (Opening Statement of Sr. Procurador Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n (\"The strict liability system of the 2008 Constitution does not take into account the notion of guilt and this link of causality is presumed.\").\n\n147.\n\nPerenco disagreed. It maintained that whether before or after the 2008 Constitution, the State was required to demonstrate causation. It acknowledged that under the post-2008 strict liability regime, it sufficed if the State demonstrated the incidence of \"wrongful (negligent or malicious)\" conduct coupled with proof of the existence of environmental damage; this would trigger the operation of a presumption of causation.\n\n148.\n\nEcuador submitted that \"both under the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution and under the prior environmental liability regime, it may be presumed that operators of inherently dangerous activities caused any environmental harm found in the area of their operations of the kind that potentially result from such activities.\"313 It relied on the evidence of Professors Crespo and Andrade. The latter asserted that \"the presumption of fault in the *Delfina Torres* decision, which accepted the theory of risk, implies in fact two distinct presumptions: one irrebuttable presumption of the existence of fault regarding hazardous activities and *another rebuttable* *presumption with regards to causation, pursuant to which one may be exempted from one's environmental liability by proving that the harm was caused by another*.\"314\n\nReply, paragraph 371.\n\nExpert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraph 58 as cited in Reply, paragraph 372.\n\n149.\n\nAs for Professor Crespo, his expert evidence was that under a strict liability regime, causation is presumed. He cited the drafting history of the 2008 Convention, where the Working Group on Natural Resources and Biodiversity referred to a \"presumption of innocence...in favour of the environment\" and explained that, consequently, the \"plaintiff will not be required to prove the causality link, which will fall on the defendant.\"315 On cross-examination, he clarified that it was not the case that causation has been done away with. Instead, it was that Ecuador had to prove that there was environmental harm (\"an alteration; that is, a modification with a negative impact of the environment\")316 and that an operator had been operating in the area where the harm was found in order to trigger the presumption that that operator was responsible for the harm created.317 Professor Crespo was pressed further on the issue of burden of proof in the course of his oral evidence. He testified that the victim of the harm \"should show that there is a negative environmental impact in the area of operation\" and \"with the indication of a negative environmental impact, the other Party has to prove that that damage does not exist or doesn't have causation\" on the basis of the exceptions discussed.318\n\n1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, Annex 9, Constituent Assembly of Ecuador, Final Report of Working Group 5 on Natural Resources and Biodiversity, 2008, p 17; 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraph 35. The quote follows on to add: \"This principle eliminates one of the barriers hindering access to environmental justice as is the cost of evidence and the technical requirement of providing environmental harm.\" See also, Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 29, lines 9-18 (Opening Statement of Pierre Mayer).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 30 (the language used by Ecuador in the hearings).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 931(Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, pp 934-936 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza). Similarly, in the event that the existence of liability is conceded, but the cost of remediation is disputed, Professor Crespo's position was that the burden rested on the operator who has been found liable to prove the non-existence of the full extent of damage claimed.\n\n150.\n\nEcuador further submitted that this approach to the burden of proof in relation to causation of environmental harm is consistent with what was provided for under the Participation Contracts. Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 Participation Contract provided that \"[t]he Contractor shall not be liable for environmental conditions preexisting at the beginning of operations under the Services Contract\",319 and Clause 5.1.20, second paragraph, of the Block 21 Participation Contract similarly provided \"[t]he Contractor shall not be responsible for pre-existing environmental conditions at the beginning of operations under the Services Contract.\"320 In its view, this suggested, first, that the Contracts intended that the Contractor shall be held liable for any and all environmental conditions in the Blocks for the duration of the Contracts. Second, since this is a limitation on the Contractor's liability, and whether prior to or after the 2008 Constitution's entry into force, the burden rested on the operator to establish any exception or limitation in its favour: \"while the Contractor's liability for environmental damage under the Participation Contracts [did] not extend to conditions existing prior to the execution of the Block 7 Services Contract (18 December 1985) and Block 21 Participation Contract (20 March 1995), it is for the Contractor to prove that such limitations apply in the instant case.\"321\n\nExhibit CE-17/CE-CC-28, Block 7 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04764, 04768, 04769.\n\nExhibit CE-10/CE-CC-13, Block 21 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04659.\n\nReply, paragraphs 383-388.\n\n151.\n\nTurning to the evidence, Ecuador submitted that IEMS' evidence demonstrated that the hydrocarbons operations had a significant impact on the environment in Blocks 7 and 21. This triggered the presumption that Perenco was liable, and Perenco had not discharged its burden of disproving that it had caused the harm (or that another available defence could be made out). Ecuador contended that Perenco did not dispute that the oil operations it conducted were hazardous or high-risk and likely to cause contamination of the environment, only that *all* the contamination found in Blocks 7 and 21 might not necessarily be associated with oilfield operations.322\n\nReply, paragraph 378\n\n152.\n\nEcuador further contended that Perenco's expert, GSI, applied \"indicator parameters\" so as to distinguish between exceedances that could be attributed to hydrocarbon operations as opposed to those which could not be linked to hydrocarbon operations, and in doing so used the indicia of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (\"TPH\") and barium only, while excluding testing for heavy metals.323 Ecuador asserted that this approach flew in the face of Ecuador's environmental regulations for hydrocarbon operations (such as RAOHE) which included permissible contamination limits for all other heavy metals: lead, nickel, cadmium and vanadium *etc*.324\n\nReply, paragraph 378, referring to GSI ER I, paragraph 225.\n\nReply, paragraphs 379-380.\n\n153.\n\nFor its part, Perenco submitted that regardless of whether the applicable legal regime was a fault-based or a strict liability regime, Ecuador had conceded that it bore the burden of establishing that it had \"suffered harm.\"325 Under the pre-2008 regime, the existence of harm was a \"separate and necessary predicate to tortious liability.\"326 The claimant in a tortious action was required to demonstrate a \"causal nexus between the tortfeasor's actions and the harm for an action in tortious liability to succeed.\"327\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 214-217, referring to statement made by Ecuador in its Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 4, and Crespo in his first expert report at paragraph 91; Rejoinder, paragraphs 241-242.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 215, 222-229.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 222, referring to 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 5455, 67-69, 82 cf. the evidence of Professor Crespo in his first expert report at paragraphs 80, 101-102.\n\n154.\n\nEven under the post-2008 regime, causation remained a critical element.328 Perenco contended Ecuador and its legal experts acknowledged this in the course of their submissions, with Professor Andrade stating that \"the causal link, as a condition for liability, does not disappear in environmental matters, either under the strict liability regime of the 2008 Constitution or under the previous regime.\"329 Perenco emphasised that Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution provides that \"[e]ach of the participants...shall be directly liable for...repairing the damages *it has caused* [\u2026]\"330\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 222-226 c.f. Reply, paragraph 10; Rejoinder, paragraphs 242271.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 244; citing Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraph 63.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 226 [Emphasis of the Claimant], referring to Exhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, p 123 of PDF.\n\n155.\n\nRather than a rebuttable presumption of causation in favour of the environment, the burden being on the operator to challenge the presumption, Perenco submitted that the burden, first and foremost, remained on Ecuador to \"affirmatively *prove* the existence of a causal link.\"331 Perenco's legal expert challenged the applicability of the Ecuadorian judicial decisions relied upon by Ecuador to argue that a strict liability regime existed prior to the 2008 Constitution, submitting instead that they stood for the proposition that in order for a presumption to arise, the State is required to establish causation.332 Ecuador could not retract from its position that this regime then carried over to the 2008 Constitution.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 246 [Emphasis added.].\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 60-63.\n\n156.\n\nIn the *Medardo Luna* case, Ecuador's Supreme Court stated \"the harmed party must.demonstrate: the fact, the damage, and *the relationship of causal link among them* [\u2026]\"333 In *Delfina Torres*, the Court held that \"[t]he claimant had to prove: a) the harm of which it claims it is a victim; b) its amount or quantum; and c) *the events that caused such harm.* \"334 Professor Crespo concluded that a claim for environmental damage is made out where \"the State has proven: the *occurrence* of environmental damage, and [t]hat the operator/defendant performed any of the activities described in Articles 397 or 408 of the Constitution [..].\"335\n\nExhibit CA-CC-32, *Medardo Luna*, p 4; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 215.\n\nExhibit EL-145, *Delfina Torres*, p 32.\n\n1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraph 91. Article 397 of the 2008 Constitution does not list specific activities (see above where the provision is quoted). Article 408 states \"non-renewable natural resources and, in general, the products of the subsoil, mineral deposits and hydrocarbons reservoirs, substances with a nature other than that of soil, even those found in areas covered by waters of the territorial seas and maritime zones, as well as the biodiversity and its genetic patrimony and the radioelectric spectrum, are of the State\u2018s inalienable, imprescriptible and unseizable property. These goods may only be exploited in strict compliance with the environmental principles set forth in the Constitution.\"\n\n157.\n\nPerenco interpreted the use of the word \"occurrence\" as an affirmation of the requirement that the State must prove causation. Dr. Bed\u00f3n opined that this burden required Ecuador to prove, both in law and in fact that there was an impact on the environment that exceeded the permissible regulatory limits, and that this could be attributed to the operator.336 He claimed that Ecuador's argument, that there was a presumption of causation that Perenco was required to rebut, was based on a misreading of *Delfina Torres*.337 The court, in his view, \"established a presumption of breach of the duty of care, and not of causation\"338 and he cited the following passage from the decision in *Delfina Torres* in support of this view:\n\nHarm, as a factual phenomenon, is different from legal damage. The latter arises only when certain essential features are met, which must concur to the detriment or impairment of the harmed party. The harm is legal and, as such, shall be able to be redressed when certain. Certainty of its existence is an essential assumption, as harm, for the purposes of liability, is anywhere its existence has been scientifically proven. Hypothetical or future harm cannot be compensated. In these matters, claiming harm in the abstract or its mere possibility is not enough, real and effectively suffered harm must be proven; harm that has not been demonstrated procedurally, with evidentiary elements which externalize a harm, does not legally exist.339\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 18.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 246; 2nd Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 133-137.\n\n2nd Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 133-136; Rejoinder, paragraph 246.\n\nExhibit EL-145, *Delfina Torres* as quoted in footnote 18 of 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 18 for the point that \"[f]rom a legal standpoint, the concept of \u2018environmental damage' is a key component in the correct analysis of environmental liability in Ecuador.\"\n\n158.\n\nThis was consistent with the provisions of the Participation Contracts which, in Perenco's view, \"exonerate the Claimant from responsibility for harm caused by others.\"340 They provided that the operator would not be \"responsible for pre-existing environmental conditions\" preceding the start of the participation contract in the case of Block 21 and the service contract in the case of Block 7.341 Moreover, Clause 5.1.19 of the Block 21 Contract provided that the \"Contractor shall not be responsible for changes to the ecosystem caused by third parties within the Contract Area.\"342 Clause 5.7.3 of the Block 7 Contract stated that \"[i]n performing this Contract, neither party shall be liable for damages.unless the damage.was caused by the Party's own acts.\"343\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 248.\n\nClause 5.1.20 of Block 21 Contract (Exhibit CE-10/CE-CC-13, Block 21 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12)) and Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 Contract (Exhibit CE-17/CE-CC-28, Block 7 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12)).\n\nClause 5.1.19 in full: \"While conducting the operations, the Contractor shall take every necessary measure to ensure the preservation and safety of lives and properties and preserve the environment.

Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 195 (Opening Statement of Mark Friedman); Reply, sections 3.4.1.1 and 3.4.1.2.\n\n169.\n\nEcuador noted that Article 396, paragraph 4, of the Constitution provides that \"[l]egal actions to prosecute and sanction environmental harm shall be imprescriptible.\"368 It also adverted to the decisions of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court of Justice in *Nelson Alc\u00edvar*369 and *Delfina Torres*370 to suggest that environmental tort claims cannot expire and that even if there were a statute of limitations, the limitation period would begin to run only as of the date that the harm was discovered.371 In *Nelson Alc\u00edvar*, the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumb\u00edos declared that Article 396, paragraph 4, of the Constitution (on imprescriptibility) applied despite the fact that the relevant conduct occurred before the 2008 Constitution entered into force.372 In *Delfina Torres*, the Supreme Court of Justice of Ecuador recognised that the statute of limitations began to run not from the date on which the damage was perpetrated but the date on which it could be discerned.373 It emphasised that any doubts regarding the interpretation of the applicability of the 2008 Constitution and its provision on imprescriptibility should be resolved \"in favour of environmental protection,\"374 relying on the following passage from *Nelson Alc\u00edvar* :\n\n\"It must be emphasized that, on account of the constitutional principle that states that in doubt the rule that most favours environmental protection shall apply, because it is a norm that generates ample protectionfor the environment it always falls to apply what is foreseen in the current Constitution, over and above the provisions of the Environmental Management Law or the 1998 Constitution. In addition, the provisions of the current Constitution in all that relates to environmental issues and environmental protection should be preferably applied, given that, in procedural matters, the rules in force at the time of filing the action apply, and not those in force when the legal situationarose.\"375\n\nExhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013). Ecuador further relied on Article 11(3) of the Constitution, emphasising that it provided that its provisions were of \"direct and immediate application\". \"The rights and guarantees set forth in the Constitution and in international human rights instruments shall be of direct and immediate application by and before any public, administrative or judicial servant, *ex officio* or upon request by a party.\" (Unofficial translation from Spanish original: \"[l] *os derechos y garant\u00edas establecidos en* *la Constituci\u00f3n y en los instrumentos internacionales de derechos humanos ser\u00e1n de directa e inmediata aplicaci\u00f3n por y ante cualquier servidor p\u00fablico, administrativo o judicial, de oficio o a petici\u00f3n de parte* \").

Professor Andrade referred to the academic writing of A. Vidal Olivares in \" *Las acciones emanadas del dano ambiental y el r\u00e9gimen de responsibilidad aplicable* \", no 4, Julio 2007, nota 20, Annex No. 32 to Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez: \"The authors agree that when damage manifests itself after the illicit action is verified; the statute of limitations should be calculated from the manifestation of the damage.\"\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 52 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 45 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nAnnex No. 29 to Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez (partial translation resubmitted on 10-182013), *Nelson Alc\u00edvar* ; Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraph 29.\n\n170.\n\nIn this regard, Ecuador's experts, Professors Crespo and Andrade, submitted that it was the date of discovery or the \"verification\" of environmental harm that mattered for limitation purposes.376 It was the \"very nature of environmental harm require[d] that this be so:\"377\n\n\"...unlike traditional, simple figures of torts, the effects of soil and groundwater pollution are not immediately manifest. Instead, they surface progressively over a long period of time. Verification requires extensive tests and scientific analyses. Without these, the environmental damage remains for the most part invisible. Thus, if the relevant date for limitation purposes were the moment the damaging act occurred, in most occasions environmental liability would simply become unenforceable.\"\n\nReply, paragraph 14.\n\nReply, paragraph 398.\n\n171.\n\nSince in this case the harm was discovered in 2011 after the 2008 Constitution and its provision regarding imprescriptibility entered into force, Perenco's submission that the 4-year limitation under Article 2235 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code applied to bar claims for damage occurring over 4 years before the counterclaim was filed could carry no weight.378 In any event, less than 4 years elapsed between the discovery of the environmental harm and the filing of the present counterclaim.379\n\nReply, paragraph 14.\n\nReply, paragraph 14; Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez.\n\n172.\n\nEcuador submitted in the further alternative that environmental harm is susceptible to the \"general principle of tort law\" that recognises \"continuing torts\", defined as \"civil wrongs committed not at a specific point in time but continuously throughout a certain period\" and which are thus considered \"to have occurred at the moment when the wrongful conduct ceases.\"380 The limitation period can only start to run from the date that the wrongful conduct is deemed to have ceased.381 As a result, since the harm in this case is \"not the result of an individual act.but rather the accumulated result of the entirety of the low-cost oil operation\" conducted by Perenco from 2002 to 2009, the wrong is deemed to have been committed as of 2009, when Perenco left the Blocks, and a year after the 2008 Constitution's entry into force.382\n\nReply, paragraph 326, section 3.4.1.3.\n\nReply, paragraph 330; relying on Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraph 51; and the work of M. Pe\u00f1a Chac\u00f3n, \" *Da\u00f1o ambiental y prescripci\u00f3n\", published in Revista electr\u00f3nica de Derecho Ambiental No. 19*, July 2009 (Annex No. 31).\n\nReply, paragraphs 325-331.\n\n173.\n\nEcuador also invoked Article 11(3) of the 2008 Constitution, namely, that \"[t]he rights and guarantees set forth in the Constitution...shall be of *direct and immediate application* by and before any public, administrative or judicial servant, *ex officio* or upon request by a party.\"383 It used this to contend in the alternative that the relevant point of time was the time the claim was filed rather than the time the claim was said to have arisen (i.e., discovered).384\n\nExhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013) [Emphasis added].\n\nReply, paragraph 396.\n\n174.\n\nIn other words, the 2008 Constitution and its provision on imprescriptibility applied without limitation to the claims advanced in this arbitration because they were filed after it entered into force in October 2008.385 Ecuador further contended that the strict liability regime put into place by Article 396 of the Constitution indicated, by the choice of strict as opposed to a fault-based liability, that the intention was to home in on the existence of harm rather than the chain of causation leading to the harm.386\n\nReply, paragraph 396.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaim, Day 1, pp 41-43 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero): \"First, from the perspective of the conditions for liability, fault-based liability requires, as its name indicates, proof of fault. For strict liability, fault is indifferent. Second.from the perspective this time of the object of the rule of liability, fault-based liability regulates conduct; whereas, strict liability is addressed at harm...from the perspective of the function, fault-based liability seeks to prevent faulty or illegal conduct. Strict liability seeks to guarantee the reparation of the harm under all circumstances.\" Ecuador submitted this approach had been recognised by Ecuadorian courts, relying on the decision in *Nelson Alc\u00edvar* (Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, Annex 29) which it claimed stood for the proposition that the 2008 Constitution applied \"to all claims filed after its entry into force and not just to harm discovered after that date.\" Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 44-46 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero). Dr. Silva Romero quoted from the decision, that \"[t]he environmental action protects a common good that is essential to humanity's existence, and, therefore, it is logical that the current Constitution does not contemplate a term for a statute of limitations for this type of action.\".\n\n175.\n\nAlso in the alternative, Ecuador argued that if the Tribunal was not convinced by the \u2018discovery rule', the principle of \u2018continuing torts' or the consequence of Article 11(3), with the result that the imprescriptibility of the strict liability regime only took effect in 2008, the Constitution's prohibition on retroactive application did not apply to laws aimed at a public interest, such as laws \"issued to protect broad sectors of the public which are considered to be in a vulnerable situation, *vis-a-vis* other sectors of society.\"387 In its submission, the 2008 Constitution's provisions relating to the protection of the environment naturally fell within the exception to retroactivity.388\n\nReply, section 3.2.3; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 47-48 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero). Ecuador relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice of Ecuador in *Baquerizo v. Shulton*, 25 September 2003 (Exhibit CA-CC-29): \"It is true that the majority of the laws of public order are applied with a retroactive effect because they affect the general interest of the collective public.those laws that were issued to protect broad sectors of the public, which are considered to be in a vulnerable situation vis-\u00e0-vis other sectors of society.\"\n\n*Ibid.* Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 48-49 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero), quoting from the decision in Exhibit CA-CC-29, *Baquerizo v Shaulton*... Ecuador further relied on Article 14 of the 2008 Constitution which referred to environmental conservation as a matter of public interest: see Exhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, p 13 of PDF. Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 39, citing Article 14 of the 2008 Constitution which provides that \"[e]nvironmental conservation, the protection of ecosystems, biodiversity and the integrity of the country's generic assets, the prevention of environmental damage, and the recovery of degraded natural spaces are declared matters of public interest.\" Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 69, lines 2-3 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\n176.\n\nIn response to this series of arguments, Perenco responded that the Tribunal should \"apply the law that was actually in force in Ecuador at the times the alleged environmental conditions were created - all of which predate[d] the 2008 Constitution.\"389 This was tied to its position that prior to the 2008 Constitution's entry into force, the operative regime was fault-based and therefore an operator could not be found liable if it could demonstrate it had been operating in accordance with its duty of care at all relevant times and consistently with applicable regulations.390 Perenco contended that this was an attempt by Ecuador to escape its burden of proving that the Consortium was at fault, and to accept it would be to condone a violation of Ecuador's \"own constitutional principle of legal certainty.\"391\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 24; Rejoinder, paragraphs 329-344.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 23; Rejoinder, paragraphs 309-317.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 24.\n\n177.\n\nPerenco further submitted that the Consortium cannot be held liable for harm that may have occurred \"after Ecuador's July 2009 takeover of the Blocks, or before January 2007, which is when the four-year statute of limitations window since Ecuador first asserted its counterclaims ends.\"392 Ecuador's statute of limitation for tort claims runs for four years from the date when the allegedly damaging act occurred.393 This is provided for expressly in Article 2235 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code.394 Perenco contended that since \"Ecuador filed its first set of counterclaims in January 2011 in the *Burlington* case, any claims for incidents [that occurred] before January 2007 [were] time-barred.\"395\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 23, 194, 488-497.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 489, citing Exhibit CA-CC-38, Civil Code, Article 2235 and 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 78.\n\nExhibit CA-CC-38, Civil Code, p 151 of PDF: (Original) Art. 2235.- *Las acciones que concede este T\u00edtulo por da\u00f1o o dolo prescriben en cuatro a\u00f1os, contados desde la perpetraci\u00f3n del acto*.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 489 [Italics in original].\n\n178.\n\nPerenco also challenged Ecuador's reliance on the 2008 Constitution's provision on imprescriptibility, asserting it was inapplicable to this claim and thus did not affect the statute of limitation analysis.396 Professor Crespo's opinion that the new constitutional provisions relating to the protection of the environment were of immediate application because they were a matter of public policy could not mean that they applied retroactively; the proscription against the retroactive application of law remained part of Ecuadorian law and the 2008 Constitution.397 Perenco also rejected Professor Crespo's use of a \u2018verification' approach, contending he could not provide any authority under Ecuadorian law to support the theory.398\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 341-344.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 492, 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 52-55 c.f. Reply, section 3.2.3.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 492-495; cf. Reply, paragraph 336: Ecuador submitted that Perenco's position is contradicted \"by the very case-law that it cites. The *Baquerizo* judgment, cited erroneously in its support, only states that \"laws *normally* do not apply retroactively\" (emphasis added). However, the judgment continues to say, \"most public law regulations apply retroactively because they affect the general interest of society\". The Ecuadorian Supreme Court then considers for instance that all regulations that seek to protect a vulnerable sector of society have retroactive effect. (Exhibit CA-CC-29, Supreme Court of Justice, Third Civil and Mercantile Chamber, published in Judicial Gazette No. 12 of September 25, 2003); Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraphs 45-46.\n\n179.\n\nPerenco further submitted that the \"discovery rule\" and \"continuing torts\" theories advanced by Ecuador did not exist in Ecuadorian law.399 Ecuador and Professor Andrade did not provide any authority to support these rules and their acceptance would undermine the express words of Article 2235 of the Civil Code.400 Perenco contended that Ecuador accepts that Article 2235 expressly provides that the statute of limitation runs from the date on which the allegedly harmful act was perpetrated401 and Professor Andrade cited no Ecuadorian judicial authority in support of the proposition that a derogation from Article 2235 can occur in environmental cases.402\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 329.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 329-331.\n\nExhibit CA-CC-38, Civil Code.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 331; Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraph 95.\n\n180.\n\nPerenco further claimed that Ecuador did not understand the concept of the \"discovery rule\" (while simultaneously maintaining its position that the rule did not exist in Ecuadorian law) which enabled the suspension of the limitations period \"for so long as the claimant could not reasonably have discovered the alleged harm.\"403 Such a rule \"[did] not allow a tribunal to suspend the limitations period when the claimant knew of, or could reasonably have discovered, the alleged harm and yet failed to act.\"404 In this case, Ecuador was on \"constant notice\" of the environmental condition of the Blocks through the \"regular reporting, audit, inspection and verification process\" and thus cannot claim to have not been in a position to advance the claims if it saw fit to do so.405\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 333; Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraph 95.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 333-336.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 333-336.\n\n181.\n\nPerenco similarly rejected the applicability of a \"continuing torts\" theory, contending that the exceedances (whether of background values or of regulatory criteria) were not, using Ecuador's pleaded language, \"the result of an individual act that took place at a specific point in time\".406 Incidents that may have caused contamination were not \"a continuous and undefined act\" or one \"aggregate act.\"407\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 338-340.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 338.\n\n182.\n\nPerenco maintained that the only period for which claims would be imprescriptible \"would be between October 20, 2008 (when the Constitution entered into effect) and July 16, 2009 (when Petroamazonas assumed the operation of Blocks 7 and 21).\"408 Every incident raised by Ecuador in this counterclaim occurred before 20 October 2008.409\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 496-497.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 497.\n\n**(5) Remediation criteria**\n----------------------------\n\n183.\n\nAs noted above, Perenco submitted that Ecuador had conceded that a predicate of a tortious claim for liability in an environmental claim is proof of environmental harm.410 Perenco contended that environmental harm under Ecuadorian law did not encompass \" *any* impact to the environment, but [rather] an *impermissible* impact to the environment.\"411 It made this point in response to Ecuador's and IEMS' use of \"background values\", which was in turn premised on Ecuador's position that any presence in the environment of petroleum hydrocarbons or certain metals associated with hydrocarbon operations above the average background values (\" *valores de fondo* \"412) was legally impermissible. For this reason, IEMS compared its test samples against the \"level of contaminants naturally present in the area under study\" or \"Base Values\" rather than against the level of exceedances permitted by the Ecuadorian regime governing hydrocarbon resources exploitation.413\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 215-217; Bed\u00f3n ER, paragraphs 18-45.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 214 [Italics in original], 219. Dr. Bed\u00f3n used the term \"environmental damage\" in his expert reports but it seems it was used interchangeably with \"environmental harm\" (see, for example, paragraph 18 of his first report). See 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 18-45.\n\nPerenco argued that this term has been incorrectly translated by Ecuador as \"base values\", and refers to Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 138.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 158; 4th Expert Report of IEMS dated 4 September 2013 (\"IEMS ER IV\"), p 7 (\"IEMS has undertaken this evaluation consistent with the Ecuadorian regulations. Indeed, our approach was even more technically-sound than these regulations (and it should be noted that our process resulted in background levels that are less stringent, more tolerant, to contamination)\").\n\n184.\n\nPerenco emphasised that when IEMS submitted its report to the *Burlington* tribunal about 10 months before its first submission to this Tribunal,414 in selecting its criteria for evaluating the Consortium's compliance with environmental standards, IEMS referred to the notion of \"tolerable\" levels of contaminants.415 IEMS had stated that \"on properties that are used for productive purposes related with petroleum activities, we tolerate certain concentrations of contaminants\", because they represented \"an alteration of little relevance.\"416 It concluded that this was represented by RAOHE and TULAS, the permissible limits of which \"ma[de] it possible to establish whether the presence of contaminants at certain levels and components of the environment (soil, surface water and underground water) [was] tolerable\", and added it was \"not necessary to consider international comparison criteria considering that the environmental regulations in Ecuador specify precise criteria for all these parameters or contaminants [\u2026].\"417\n\nExhibit CE-CC-251, IEMS Environmental Evaluation Report, Hydrocarbon Activities, Consortium for Block 7 and Block 21, *Burlington v.

Strengthening the prior soil and groundwater sampling results via the determination and evaluation of background levels for those contaminants whose presence may be attributable to natural conditions or other causes.\"422 (In its supplemental report in this arbitration, in the course of responding to the evidence of its former employee, Mr. Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, who, amongst other things, challenged IEMS' decision to employ background values,423 IEMS stated \"[w]e also find it very strange that Mr. Mart\u00ednez should criticize us for assessing the presence of contamination against the background values of the Blocks.

Perenco also raised the example of IEMS' report in the case of *City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21 [hereinafter *City Oriente v. Ecuador* ] (Exhibit CE-CC-169), where IEMS referred to remediating affected areas up to the permissible limits set forth in RAOHE. (Rejoinder, paragraph 73).\n\nWitness Statement of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, paragraphs 7-27.\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 8 [Emphasis added.].\n\n187.\n\nIn Perenco's view, IEMS had changed its evaluative criteria not because of its own views as to how to properly evaluate the Blocks' conditions, but rather because it was instructed to do so by its client. In acceding to that instruction, it had abandoned its prior (correct) position that only contaminants that exceeded the applicable regulatory criteria (so-called \"regulatory exceedances\") amounted to contamination under Ecuadorian law. On its prior approach, environmental harm was determined by whether contamination in a specific case exceeded the permitted levels, not by measuring soil samples against \"background values.\" This was the approach which Perenco itself employed.\n\n188.\n\nEcuador responded to Perenco's criticism in defence of IEMS' use of the \u2018background values' approach on the ground that \"Ecuadorian regulatory criteria [did] not provide for full remediation of the contamination and, therefore, [did] not fully protect the environment or human health.\"425 It considered that since there could be no expectation that hydrocarbons-related substances occur naturally in the environment of Blocks 7 and 21, the Base Value employed should be 0 mg/Kg.426 It further contended that this was in line with the import of the Consortium's contractual obligations to require the complete restoration of the environment in the Blocks (relying on Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 Contract427 and Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 21 Contract).428\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 158; Reply, section 3.1.1; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 59 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 162.\n\n\"Take responsibility for the cleanup and reforestation of the area with species similar to those originally found at the site, in order to, with time, allow the potential return to environmental conditions similar to those encountered at the beginning of the operations; also take responsibility for the abandonment of wells and installations for which the Contractor has been responsible as a consequence of the execution of this Contract.\" (Exhibit CE-17/CE-CC-28, Block 7 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04764, 04768, 04769).\n\n\"The Contractor shall be responsible for the clean-up, reforestation, and abandonment of non-productive wells and facilities as a result of this Contract.\" (Exhibit CE-10/CE-CC-13, Block 21 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04659); Rejoinder, paragraph 50.\n\n189.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Ecuador submitted that the \"notion of repairable harm is not in fact defined in TULAS and RAOHE through \u2018permissible limits', but rather in the [Environmental Management Law].\"429 It relied on the Law's definition of the term \u2018environmental harm' and asserted that the Constitutional Court has confirmed that this is the operative definition under Ecuadorian law and it defines the extent of the obligation to repair:\n\n**Environmental Harm**... - Any *significant loss,* diminution, detriment or impairment of the *preexisting conditions* in the environment or one of its components. It affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its resources.430\n\nReply, paragraph 246; see also, Reply, paragraph 6; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 59, line 12 to 60, line 10 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, p 18 [Emphasis added.]. The Parties evidently do not disagree on the English translation of these definitions: see Reply, paragraphs 246-258 and Rejoinder, paragraphs 37-38.\n\n190.\n\nEcuador also pointed to Ministerial Decree 169 on the \"Principles and Definitions of Environmental Public Policy\", Article 1 of which defines \"environmental damage\" as follows:\n\n\"[It is] the negative environmental impact to the environmental conditions present in a given space, caused by the development of development projects, which lead to an imbalance in the ecosystems' functions and that alter the supply of the services that such ecosystems contribute to society.\"431\n\nTranslation of Respondent: Exhibit EL-193, Ministerial Decree 169, Article 1; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 60 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\n191.\n\nEcuador also relied on the evidence of Professor Andrade who asserted that RAOHE and TULAS were confined to setting the thresholds within which hydrocarbon activities could be undertaken in Ecuador and, in that connection, while administrative sanctions may be imposed on the operators for illicit hydrocarbon activities, they did not purport to define the notion of environmental harm for the purpose of the constitutional requirement to remedy any and all environmental harm.432\n\nReply, paragraphs 6, 241-247; Constitutional Court Case No. 1457-07-RA, published in the Official Register Supplement No. 1, 18 August 2009, (Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, Annex 4); Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 62-63 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero). See, in particular, Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, paragraphs 18, 21, 26(c) and 27: \"Perenco and Burlington claim that this interpretation of the concept of environmental harm causes the permissible limits contained in the TULAS and the RAOHE to lose all effect. As I explained, this is not true: these limits mark the boundaries from which a given activity is operating in a lawful manner, regardless of the general duty to repair the damage actually caused. Moreover, it is Prof. Bed\u00f3n who actually commits the error eviscerating the technical rules invoked, because, according to his interpretation, the \"baseline values\" or \"quality criteria\", also set by the TULAS would be irrelevant. The only interpretation that preserves the coherence of the system is as follows: while baseline values determine the scope of the obligation to repair the environmental harm, the permissible limits define the activities that can be carried out lawfully.\"\n\n192.\n\nEcuador contended that Perenco's position in effect contradicted the reference to \"full restoration\" in Article 396 of the Constitution and Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 Participation Contract, and to background values and the requirement to restore contaminated soil to its \"prior condition\" in Article 4.1 of TULAS.433 Furthermore:\n\n\"The fact that an activity is lawfully conducted does not mean, in environmental law, that the harm caused need not be repaired. That is precisely the point of a regime of strict liability, to guarantee that the harm is always repaired no matter whether the activity that caused that harm was lawful or not.\"434\n\nReply, paragraph 252: referring to Article 397 of the 2008 Constitution (Exhibit EL-89) and Article 4.1 of Volume VI Annex 2 of TULAS (Exhibit EL-146). It also submitted that Perenco's position was incompatible with two fundamental principles of environmental law: \"that operators should internalize the environmental costs of their economic activities\" and the \"principle of nature as a bearer of rights.\"\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 62-63 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\n193.\n\nEcuador also referred to the preparatory material of the 2008 Constitution in support of its position; for example, the view of one assembly member, Mr. Sergio Chac\u00f3n Padilla, in a minority report on the \"rights of nature\", in which he states that \"instead of speaking of reparation we should use the notion of restoration or re-composition, given that reparation could be understood in the simple sense of \u2018compensating', while the re-composition or restoration would imply bringing things back to their original state or place, without prejudice to the obligation to compensate for the harms or damages caused to those affected directly.\"435 Ecuador submitted that to accept Perenco's position would be to \"render part of Ecuadorian regulations obsolete.\"436\n\nExhibit EL-195, Minority Report of the Assembly Member on the rights of nature (translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013); Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 57 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nReply, paragraph 254.\n\n194.\n\nIn short, Ecuador's position was that Ecuadorian administrative law contemplated a separation between the notions of reparable harm and unlawful conduct. This meant that, \"with regards to TULAS and RAOHE, an operator that complies entirely with its obligations under both regulations, including the obligation to abide by the permissible limits, will nevertheless be obliged to repair the contamination it has caused.\"437 Recoverable environmental harm was \"any significant negative impact, particularly if it affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewal of its resources.\"438 The burden was on Perenco to demonstrate that the damage suffered by the environment in Blocks 7 and 21 was \"insignificant.\"439\n\nReply, paragraphs 243-258; citing the work of two scholars, Betancor Rodr\u00edguez (Exhibit EL-196) and Pe\u00f1a Chac\u00f3n (Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez, Annex 31); see also, Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 62-63 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nReply, paragraph 258.\n\nReply, section 3.1.2, relying on Article 397.1 of the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution (Exhibit EL-89).\n\n195.\n\nIn the alternative, Ecuador submitted that even considering the regulatory thresholds in RAOHE and TULAS, 92% of the areas IEMS tested were polluted with hydrocarbons and/or heavy metals, and 100% of the 18 sites tested for water pollution similarly yielded concentrations of contaminants above the regulatory values.440\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 176; the only exceptions were Puerto Napo, Waponi, PAD F, Gacela 3 and Payamino 9 which IEMS found presented contamination above Base Values but not above regulatory thresholds. (IEMS ER II, Annex T).\n\n196.\n\nIn reply to this submission, Perenco argued that Ecuador had \"failed cogently to rebut the point that *not every impact* on the environment gives rise to recoverable environmental harm under Ecuadorian law.\"441 First, when invoking Perenco's contractual obligations Ecuador omitted the reference in the same provisions to the requirement that the Contractor should carry out its obligations in accordance with RAOHE or more generally, the applicable \"legislation in effect in Ecuador at the time that such clean-up, reforestation, or abandonment is carried out.\"442\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 23 [Emphasis added.].\n\nQuoting from Clause 5.1.20 of the Block 21 Contract (Exhibit CE-10/CE-CC-13, Block 21 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04659). Clause 5.1.20.10 also similarly provided that \"[s]aid cleanup, reforestation and return to similar conditions and abandonment activities shall be performed in accordance with [RAOHE].\". (Exhibit CE-17/CE-CC-28, Block 7 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-1212), PER 04764, 04768, 04769). See Rejoinder, paragraphs 49-54.\n\n197.\n\nPerenco submitted that, in any event, these obligations were concerned with decommissioning at the end of the useful life of a well or field and did not apply to ongoing operations.443 Blocks 7 and 21, however, were \"decades away from being decommissioned, as evidenced by Ecuador's current expansion.\"444 Therefore, these obligations could not be invoked by Ecuador.445\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 51.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 51.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 49-54.\n\n198.\n\nSecond, Perenco did not deny that the definition of environmental law in the Environmental Management Law was relevant; its position was rather that the permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS implemented the \"significant harm\" standard.446\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 23 and 39.\n\n199.\n\nEcuador replied that this could not be the relationship between the definition and RAOHE/TULAS, because the \"two [would then be] essentially contradictory\", explaining that TULAS and RAOHE \"seek to impose limits on economic activities that are potentially dangerous to the environment, whereas the \u2018significant damage' standard define[d] recoverable environmental harm.\"447 The \u2018significant harm' standard [was] perfectly operational without the need for numerical standards\", the Environmental Management Law's definition providing \"two operational criteria, by qualifying [significant harm] as all impact that \u2018affect[ed] the functioning of the ecosystem or renewal of its resources'.\"448\n\nEcuador's Reply, paragraph 248, footnote 273 cf. Rejoinder, paragraph 24.\n\nEcuador's Reply, paragraph 249. [emphasis omitted]\n\n200.\n\nPerenco countered that this ignored the distinction that the Environmental Management Law must have intended when it stipulated two separate definitions for \"environmental harm\" and \"environmental impact.\"449 It followed that \"\u2018environmental harm' [was] not a mere impact above background values, but [rather] an impact that [was] a \u2018significant' loss, such that it \u2018affects the functioning of the ecosystem or renewal of its resources'.\"450 The permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS must be a reflection of this distinction in the Law and if their purpose was to prevent, using Ecuador's words, \"inasmuch as possible that any such harm [to the environment] should occur\" then \"an impact that is permitted [by them] cannot constitute harm.\"451 RAOHE and TULAS provided operators with legal certainty about what kind of \u2018impacts' were \u2018significant' and triggered the requirement to remediate.452 In fact, Ecuador's reliance on the Environmental Management Law exposed a flaw in its \u2018background values' case: it was premised on proving a \"mere \u2018alteration of the environment'\" which the Environmental Management Law classified as an \"impact\" rather than the indicator of \"environmental harm\".453\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 32-48. In this connection, Perenco responded to Ecuador's argument that reliance on RAOHE and TULAS was incompatible with the principle of \"full restoration\" under Ecuador's Constitution, stating that \"principle of \u2018full restoration' (*restitutio in integrum*) requires only that harm be eliminated, not that all impact must be obliterated.\" (Rejoinder, paragraph 47).\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 37-39.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 35.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 36-39.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 41.\n\n201.\n\nEcuador also relied on Professor Crespo's evidence to support the basis of its \"background values\" approach. Professor Crespo's testimony was that RAOHE and TULAS's criteria for remediation must to be understood in light of constitutional provisions, namely, the obligation to \"fully restore\" the environment in the event of environmental damage required by Article 396, paragraph 2, and the reference to \"complete reparation\" in Article 397 which concerned duties of the State in the event of environmental damage in proceeding against the operator(s) of the harmful activity.454 His evidence was that \"[b]ackground values are the ones that are - that allow for the comprehensive reparation; that is to say, for the reparation - for the remediation back to the original level. That is the way that we should understand background values; that is to say, as stated in the comprehensive remediation.\"455\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 923 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza): \"RAOHE should be applied based on Constitutional regulations, within that context. That is to say, to remediate within the context of the Constitution of Ecuador, yes, it should remediate. The concept of remediation, as explained in RAOHE, should be applied. That is to say, to return the harmed ecosystem to the original state as stated in the Constitution.\"\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, pp 924-925 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza). Counsel for Perenco pressed Professor Crespo on this evidence, posing the question: \"Remediating according to the permissible limits in RAOHE and according to what RAOHE says is consistent with that principle; correct?\". Professor Crespo responded: \"Yes. Yes. Agreed. But the concept of full remediation or reparation should prevail; that is to say, without prejudice of the standard values in RAOHE, full restoration is the original state, the original condition of the harmed ecosystems. So, we work with background values based on the original values in the harmed ecosystem.\" On re-examination, Professor Crespo reiterated this but added with respect to interpreting RAOHE consistently with the principles of the 2008 Constitution that \"in case of doubt, the Constitution prevails.\" (Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 934 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza)).\n\n202.\n\nPerenco's expert, Dr. Bed\u00f3n, expressed a different view, stating that there were three kinds of ways in which human activity could have a negative impact on the environment: (i) through \"tolerable impacts\" (activities carried out in the normal course of affairs without the need for an environmental permit and unregulated by the State), (ii) through \"authorized impacts\" (activities carried out in compliance with an environmental permit or license and within permissible limits) and (iii) through \"environmental damage or harm\".456 In his opinion, Professor Crespo \"fail[ed] to distinguish [between] these concepts, and erroneously treated them as equivalent categories.\"457\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraphs 19-23 (\"The fact that Petroamazonas have continued operating the sites bears no relationship to the existence of widespread pollution left behind by the Consortium\").\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 19.\n\n203.\n\nDr. Bed\u00f3n considered that Professor Crespo erred in arriving at his conclusion because in citing Articles 396 and 397 of the 2008 Constitution he was suggesting \"without any grounds that environmental impact and environmental damage [were] equivalent terms.\"458 In Dr. Bed\u00f3n's view, Articles 396 and 397 referred to the duty of the State to adopt legislation to address \"negative environmental impacts\", not just any impact on the environment, and established a strict liability regime for environmental matters and reiterated the duty of the State to take action to safeguard human health and restore ecosystems.459 However, there was no reference to the necessity of adopting background values in substitution of regulatory criteria such as that provided by RAOHE and TULAS.\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 24 cf. 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraphs 75-79.\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 25.\n\n204.\n\nDr. Bed\u00f3n referred in this regard to an academic authority cited by Professor Crespo, that of the author Mario Pe\u00f1a Chac\u00f3n, in a work titled *Da\u00f1o, responsabilidad y reparaci\u00f3n ambiental* [\"Environmental Damage, Liability and Reparation\"] which distinguished between \"legally relevant environmental damage\" and \"acts or omissions [that] are considered legal\":\n\nThe legality or illegality of conduct that damages the environment depends on its conformity or nonconformity with the legal order. Acts or omissions are considered legal if they accord with the body of laws in force and, thus, it has the approval or permit of the relevant authorities.\n\nLegally relevant environmental damage is that damage that falls within the category of intolerable, thus it is not every type of damage that interests environmental law.460\n\nPE\u00d1A CHAC\u00d3N, Mario, *Da\u00f1o, responsabilidad y reparaci\u00f3n ambiental [Environmental Damage, Liability and Reparagraphtion]*, pages 12-14. Annex No. 8 to Professor Crespo's 1st Report, cited at paragraph 26 of 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n.\n\n205.\n\nPerenco further relied on the work of Andr\u00e9s Betancor, \"one of only two academic sources quoted in [Ecuador's] Constituent Assembly['s] report on strict liability for the 2008 Constitution\", and who in a text entitled *Instituciones de Derecho Ambiental* [Institutions for Environmental Law] opined:\n\nIf the licit act causes damages in accordance with the Law...there would be no sanction or reparation.The legal problem refers to when the damage is licit: licit damage is damage which is not covered by any legal duty to repair, because the law tolerates or allows it to because it is not significant or important, according to the social value legally formalized...Consequently *the acts covered by the standards and the authorizations, and that cause damages [sic] do not constitute an environmental violation and there is no duty to repair them*.461\n\nExhibit CA-CC-22, Betancor Rodr\u00edguez, Andr\u00e9s, *Instituciones de Derecho Ambiental* (2001), pp 12461247 (English translation); see also, Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 220 [Emphasis added.].\n\n206.\n\nReplying on Dr. Bed\u00f3n's evidence, Perenco submitted that the \"very purpose\" of RAOHE and TULAS was to \"define what constitute[d] impermissible harm to the environment under Ecuadorian l aw.\"462 The opening lines of Table 6 of RAOHE confirmed this in providing that RAOHE established \"[p]ermissible limits for the identification and remediation of contaminated soils in all phases of the hydrocarbon industry.\"463 These limits were constructed with the specific purpose \"of encouraging sustainable development.\"464 \"By employing specific regulatory limits instead of background values, states such as Ecuador [made] it possible for industry to operate within clearly defined parameters while still preserving human health and the environment.\"465\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 245\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 245, Exhibit EL-147, RAOHE.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 246; 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 32.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 246; Perenco referred to p 20 of IEMS' report in the *Burlington* proceedings: Exhibit CE-CC-251, IEMS Report in *Burlington*, p 20.\n\n207.\n\nPerenco argued that this did not change after the making of the 2008 Constitution and the introduction of a strict liability regime for environmental liability.466 Article 396 of the Constitution provides that the obligation to restore the ecosystem is triggered by evidence of environmental \"harm\", which in turn remains defined by Ecuador's environmental regulations relating to permissible limits for contaminant and remediation criteria, namely, RAOHE and (to the extent that RAOHE was inapplicable) TULAS.467\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 256-257.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 257.\n\n208.\n\nPerenco submitted that this had been accepted by IEMS as far as its evaluative criteria in the *Burlington* and the *City Oriente* proceedings were concerned.468 It contended that IEMS then changed its position in this case without basis469 and that \"Ecuador fail[ed] to provide even one example in which an Ecuadorian court, legal authority, or scholar ha[d] adopted more restrictive \u2018background values' as the test for environmental harm in place of the regulatory criteria.\"470 Furthermore, the audits, impact studies and environmental management plans of both the Consortium and Petroamazonas consistently tested for compliance with permissible limits rather than background values.471\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 246-248; referring to Exhibits CE-CC-251, IEMS Report in Burlington, PER CC\\_0010136; CE-CC-169, IEMS Environmental Evaluation Report for the Hydrocarbons Activities of City Oriente Ltd., Block 27, submitted in *City Oriente v. Ecuador*, PER\\_CC0005712; Rejoinder, paragraphs 221-223.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 246-248.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 249.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 64-65 (see e.g., Exhibit CE-CC-137, Letter of March 23, 2002 from Efficacitas to Perenco, attaching 2002 Environmental Audit of Block 21, p 7; 1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 79-83).\n\n209.\n\nAlso central to Ecuador's case that background values must be applied in order to establish the full extent of environmental remediation was its reliance on the 2008 Constitution's recognition that Nature (\" *pacha mama* \") was itself the subject of rights as well as the codification of the principles of sustainable development and the right of the human being to live in an environment free from contamination.472\n\nReply, paragraphs 248-258.\n\n210.\n\nPerenco responded that these principles have been part of Ecuadorian law since the 1970s, particularly in the 1984 and 1998 Constitutions, and during this time RAOHE and TULAS were promulgated and applied. In this regard, at the hearing, counsel for Perenco took Professor Crespo through a chronological review of various instruments applicable in Ecuador in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, to demonstrate that while strict liability became a feature of the 2008 Constitution, many of the environmental principles recognised in the Constitution, from which RAOHE and TULAS derived their content and approach, were in fact carried over from Ecuadorian legal rules that pre-dated the 2008 Constitution.473\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 919 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza).\n\n211.\n\nFor example, Professor Crespo acknowledged that the Hydrocarbons Law, promulgated in 1971, manifested the \"obligation of sustainability for operators\", that \"Ecuador [had recognised] a constitutional duty for the State to protect the environment since 1983\",474 that the \"1978 Constitution was amended in 1983 to recognize a right of the human being to live in an environment free of contamination\",475 and this carried over to the 1998 Constitution (Article 86) and then to the 2008 Constitution.476 These were not novel principles that in turn caused a fundamental shift in the scope of environmental harm.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 914 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 915 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza).\n\n212.\n\nThus, Perenco submitted that the \"background values\" approach had \"no basis in law or accepted scientific practice.\"477 It would require \"operators to explore and produce oil without making any impact on the environment whatsoever\", and would render \"obsolete\" Ecuador's \"detailed regulatory regime governing permissible impacts.\"478 It would require oilfields to be remediated to a \"pristine state of nature, as they existed before any human activity ever took place on the land in question, *even when the fields continue to be in operation* \", a reference to the fact that since July 2009 when the Consortium suspended operations, Ecuador has sustained and in some instances expanded oil production in the Blocks.479\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 10, 243-276 (261: \"The alleged \u2018possibility' that Ecuador's own legal limits are not protective enough is neither a scientific nor a legal reason for the Tribunal to refuse to apply Ecuador's own laws regarding environmental harm\") (265: \"GSI undertook a comparison of Ecuador's regulatory standards to these conservative risk-based screening levels.[it] confirmed that the permissible limits in the Ecuadorian regulations are actually more stringent than the health-based screening levels.\").\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 9-12, 218-221.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 244 [Emphasis in original]; 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 37; Rejoinder, paragraph 29 (\"It would essentially compel Claimant to pay for an exceptionally demanding end-of-life decommissioning for fields that are still being operated and further developed by Petroamazonas and will remain in operation for decades.\"); cf. Reply, paragraph 290-291.\n\n213.\n\nPerenco contended that the real reason why background values had been employed in this case was the \"obvious tactical purpose\" of inflating the remediation costs by over US$1.3 billion, this accounting for \" *more than half* \" of Ecuador's claim.480\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 14, 276 [Italics in original]. Moreover, Perenco cited GSI's conclusion that even when the risk assessment formula is applied, only 2% of IEMS' and GSI's combined 3,183 soil sampling locations exceeded the conservative health-based screening criteria, and \"none of these exceedances were physically present in locations that would threaten human health, livestock or even ecological receptors[\u2026]\" (Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 269, GSI ER I, paragraph 241.)\n\n214.\n\nPerenco also challenged Ecuador's alternative case, based on RAOHE and TULAS. In its view, Ecuador \"misapplie[d] these regulations by mischaracterizing areas that are almost entirely \u2018industrial' or \u2018agricultural zones' - with permissible threshold limits suitable to such areas - as more demanding \u2018sensitive ecosystems'.\"481 The \"vast majority\" of the areas in Blocks 7 and 21 are not \"sensitive ecosystems\".482 It submitted that \"[s]uch a mistaken characterization defies the actual use of the land that is plainly apparent to any observer - areas that with Ecuador's prior approval include wells, pits, flares, tanks, cement berms, and roads\" and stood in stark contrast to \"Ecuador's own longstanding practice prior to the onset of the present dispute...[i]n countless environmental impact studies, requests for approval, environmental audits and other documents...that the areas in the Blocks where the Consortium's operations took place are industrial zones.\"483\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 15-17.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 15-17; 1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 5771.\n\n215.\n\nMr. Wilfrido Saltos, Perenco's Quality, Safety, Health and Environment supervisor for Blocks 7 and 21, testified that in his experience, the Consortium and Ecuador routinely applied the industrial and agricultural land-use criteria in Blocks 7 and 21, particularly with respect to well pads and CPFs that were consistently characterised as being subject to industrial soils criteria.484 Much of the land surrounding Blocks 7 and 21 platforms and facilities are cultivated with African palm trees, plantains and cocoa trees.485 Mr. Saltos affirmed that areas bordering Coca CPF, Coca 6, Coca 8, Gacela 2, Gacela CPF, Lobo 1, Lobo 3 and Oso 9, among others, were used for agricultural activities and should be subject to agricultural land-use criteria rather than \"sensitive ecosystems\" criteria.486\n\n1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 57-68. Mr. Saltos cited a 11 March 2003 remediation report for contamination in an area which included Payamino CPF, Payamino Sanitary Landfill, Payamino 22, Coca CPF and Jaguar CPF, which based its remediation criteria on industrial soil criteria of Table 6 of RAOHE and noted that this was approved by the National Directorate of Environmental Protection of the Ministry of Energy and Mines on 13 June 2003. (See Exhibits CE-CC-51, Letter of January 28, 2003 from Perenco to DINAPA, attaching the Remediation Program for Block 7, including Coca-Payamino field; CE-CC-53, Letter of March 11, 2003 from Perenco to DINAPA and CE-CC-57, Letter of June 13, 2003 from the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection).\n\n1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 72-74.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraph 74.\n\n216.\n\nPerenco asserted that two-thirds of the samples tested by IEMS (and included in its report submitted with Ecuador's Counter-Memorial) would have been found compliant had the proper land use criteria been applied.487 This accounted for over US$885 million of Ecuador's US$2.4 billion claim.488 (This will be examined in further detail below in the discussion of the expert evidence presented by GSI and IEMS.)\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 16-17.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**D. Introduction to the expert evidence on the state of the Blocks**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe Parties' experts referred to a number of key concepts when defining an impact on the environment. The most important such concept is the notion of a \"regulatory exceedance.\" This occurs \"when the concentration of a particular contaminant in a given sample of soil or water exceed[ed] the legal limit.\"489\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 62.\n\n218.\n\nTurning to the experts' evaluation of the environmental conditions of the Blocks, Ecuador submitted that IEMS' evidence demonstrated that the contamination left behind in the Blocks posed a health risk and has affected, and is continuing to affect, \"the functioning of the ecosystem and the renewability of natural resources\", a phrase taken from the definition of \"environmental harm\" in the Environmental Management Law and relied upon by Ecuador as triggering Perenco's obligation to \"fully restore\" the Blocks in accordance with Article 396 of Ecuador's Constitution.490\n\nReply, paragraph 263.\n\n219.\n\nIEMS undertook a series of site investigation and sampling programmes in Blocks 7 and 21.491 It conducted four rounds of on-field investigation, collecting and testing soil and groundwater samples for hydrocarbon compounds and heavy metals.492 In total, IEMS took some 2,786 soil samples and 92 groundwater samples from Blocks 7 and 21.493\n\nIts analyses were presented in four expert reports: 1st Expert Report dated 5 December 2011 (IEMS ER I), 2nd Expert Report dated 26 April 2012 (IEMS ER II), 3rd Expert Report dated 21 February 2013 (IEMS ER III), 4th Expert Report dated 4 September 2013 (IEMS ER IV).\n\nIEMS ER III, pp 5-11.\n\nGSI ER I, p 11; Reply, paragraph 185.\n\n220.\n\nEcuador contended that applying Base Values to the results of the samples tested was the \"only methodology that accord[ed] with the strict liability regime of the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution.and the mandate to fully restore the ecosystems.\"494 It submitted that both RAOHE and TULAS \"expressly acknowledge[d]\" Base Values, and in some cases that this exceeded the regulatory thresholds.495 Thus, where the level of an oilfield-related element revealed by the sample exceeded the values at which it naturally appeared, as discerned from samples taken in areas of the Blocks untouched by hydrocarbon activities (the \"Base Values\" case), IEMS concluded there was soil contamination that required remediation.496 IEMS also prepared an alternative case, its \"regulatory exceedances\" case, in which it measured its sampling results against the standards stipulated by RAOHE, and where applicable, TULAS.497\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 255.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 167.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 798.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 176; IEMS ER II, Annex T.\n\n221.\n\nIEMS asserted that it had found significant volumes of contaminated soil in the Blocks, around 1,867,835 m3 above background levels or 691,444 m3 above regulatory criteria and ground water pollution by hydrocarbons and/or heavy metals in all locations that it tested.498 IEMS' and Ecuador's criticism of the analysis performed by Perenco's expert, GSI, was that they did not undertake a proper analysis of the environmental condition of the Blocks in accordance with the principles of the 2008 Constitution because they failed to apply Base Values, whether in Perenco's 2008 audits or in the studies GSI prepared for the purpose of this arbitration.499 In the alternative, Ecuador submitted that if the regulatory criteria of RAOHE applied, GSI had failed to apply the correct criteria when investigating the Blocks.500 In its view, the stricter standards prescribed by RAOHE for a \"sensitive ecosystem\" ought to have been used, rather than the less stringent industrial and agricultural area standards.\"501\n\nReply, paragraph 224 (taking into account three sets of corrections as explained in section 2.2.1 of its Reply); Counter-Memorial, paragraphgraph 771; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 293-299; 2nd IEMS ER, pp 180-181, Annex T (In its second expert report, IEMS quantified the volume of soil that required remediation at 1,086,883 m3 (Base Values) or 1,012,245 m3 (regulatory limits). IEMS reported that 100% of the 18 sites it had tested yielded concentrations above the thresholds set by Ecuadorian regulations: in the Payamino, Coca, Oso, Gacela, Jaguar and Mono fields of Block 7 and the Yuralpa, Dayuno and Waponi fields of Block 21. It identified a further 52 sites it intended to investigate for possible groundwater contamination.).

First round of expert reports of IEMS and GSI**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nIEMS submitted its first expert report in December of 2011.502 Its stated objective was to \"determine whether the operations of the Block 7 and Block 21 Consortium ha[d] resulted in soil and groundwater pollution in its respective areas of operation.\"503 It asserted that its methodology was based on the \"general guidelines of the standards of the American Society of Testing Materials.\"504\n\nIEMS ER I.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 3.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 11.\n\n223.\n\nIts study was undertaken in three stages: a preliminary assessment of the blocks to identify sites that were likely to evince contamination (otherwise referred to as \"Recognized Environmental Conditions\" or \" **RECs** \"), testing of samples taken from the sites and a further examination of the blocks and information that it was provided in order to identify other potentially contaminated sites.505 In its first stage, IEMS identified 29 sites, and in its second stage confirmed that 27 of the 29 sites were contaminated by hydrocarbons, heavy metals or a combination of the two.506 These sites were located within the Gacela, Lobo, Coca, Payamino, Oso, Mono, Jaguar and C\u00f3ndor fields of Block 7, and the Yuralpa, Waponi, Sumino and Nemoca fields of Block 21.507\n\nIEMS ER I, p 3.In the first stage, an IEMS team visited the facilities in Block 7 from 25 to 30 October and 8 to 12 November 2010, and in Block 21 from 22 to 26 November 2010.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 3.\n\nIEMS ER I, pp 5-6 for full list. See also, Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 811-860.\n\n224.\n\nIn determining whether the sites were contaminated, IEMS advocated for the application of Base Values. It asserted that in \"its expert opinion...the criteria provided for in Ecuadorian legislation... should not, as a rule, be used to determine the environmental liability of operators of hydrocarbon activities.\"508 It reasoned that since everyone possessed the right to an \"environment in optimum conditions for human development\", any release of contaminants that caused an \"unacceptable risk to the health of the surrounding population must be mitigated.\"509 IEMS concluded that the regulatory limits should not be applied because they \" *[did] not appear* *to be based on the protection of the health of the ecosystem or of the people who live in the* *impacted areas.* \"510 For this purpose, IEMS collected and tested 12 soil samples in areas with no industrial activity in Blocks 7 and 21 \"in order to determine the concentrations of contaminants naturally existing in the environment.\"511 These formed its Base Values.512 It applied these values to the classification of any impact caused by heavy metals (nickel, cadmium, lead, barium and vanadium).513 Where heavy metal concentration was above the \"analytical detection limit\" but below the base value, it was classified a \"low impact\".514 IEMS did not apply this analysis to the classification of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons because it considered that \"in view of the characteristics of the area of study, this element is not expected to naturally exist in the soil\".515 It concluded that a Base Value of 0 mg/kg would apply.516 IEMS also included in its analysis parameters that were not set by RAOHE; namely, pH (an indication of acidity or alkalinity), electrical conductivity, barium and vanadium.517\n\nIEMS ER I, p 18.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 19.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 19 [Italics in original].\n\nIEMS ER I, p 20.\n\nIEMS ER I, Tables 3-3 and 3-4, pp 47-49. For example, while Book 6, Annex 2, Table 2 of TULAS provides that that the criteria for electrical conductivity is 2 mmhos/cm, since the base value IEMS determined was lower at 0.01949 mmhos/cm (or 19.49 pS/cm), IEMS applied that in its analytical study of its samples. IEMS ER I, p 51 and see examples at pp 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59 et seq. Where the reference criteria was nearly the same as the Base Value, IEMS adopted the regulatory limit (such as in the case of cadmium, nickel, lead). IEMS ER I, pp 51-52.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 20.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 20.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 21.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 21.\n\nIEMS ER I, pp 23-24.\n\n225.\n\nIEMS also prepared an alternative case based on the regulatory criteria that it considered applied: RAOHE Annex 2 of Table 6 (TPH, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cadmium, nickel and lead) and TULAS Book 6, Annex 2, Table 2 (barium and vanadium).518 It stated that \"due to the fragility of the environment and the importance of preserving environmental resources in the area, [it] decided, based on its expert criteria, to apply the permissible limits for sensitive ecosystems\" in Table 6, Annex 2, of RAOHE...519\n\nIEMS ER I, pp 21-27; 48-61.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 22.\n\n226.\n\nIEMS reported that \"over 93% of the areas [it] tested...yielded concentrations of hydrocarbons and/or heavy metal contaminants above\" Base Values, this translating to 96,908 m3 of soil requiring remediation.520 In its alternative regulatory thresholds case, IEMS reported that some 89% of the areas tested exceeded the permitted exceedances standards, this translating to 63,169 m3 of soil requiring remediation.521 In determining the quantity of soil requiring remediation, IEMS utilised ArcView GIS 10.0 geostatistical modeling software.522\n\nIEMS ER I, p 65, Table 3-8; Counter-Memorial, paragraph 806.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 65, Table 3-8; Counter-Memorial, paragraph 806. Its second expert report replaced this figure with 94% of the areas tested for soil pollution (70 of the 74 locations examined), and 92% respectively (68 of the 74 locations examined).\n\nIEMS ER I, p 63. This was explained in greater detail in the second report at Annex A.8.\n\n227.\n\nIEMS also collected 61 groundwater samples from seven sites in the Blocks523 and reported that 50 samples evinced contamination by heavy metals (such as zinc, barium, copper, chrome, nickel) in concentrations exceeding the regulatory limits.524 (In testing the groundwater, IEMS did not use Base Values because that would have \"required complex, lengthy and costly hydrological studies of Blocks 7 and 21.\"525 Instead, as noted in its second report, it compared its sampling results to the values set forth in Table 5, Annex 1, Book VI, of TULAS.526)\n\nWaponi, Collection and Waste Disposal Area in the Yuralpa Field, Dayuno, Payamino 2 and 8, Coca CPF, Oso 9 and Mono CPF (IEMS ER I, p 62).\n\nIEMS ER I, pp 62-63. The 7 sites tested were Payamino 2 and 8, the Coca CPF, Oso 9, the Mono CPF, the Yuralpa Waste Management Area, Dayuno and Waponi fields (IEMS ER I, pp 72-73; Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 872-874). IEMS stated that while remediation costs would be presented in due course, it estimated the costs of groundwater remediation to range from US$ 12 million to US$ 79 million depending on the type of treatment used (IEMS ER I, p 69). IEMS named other sites it intended to investigate for groundwater contamination; in Gacela 6 and 9, Estacion Yuralpa, Coca 6, Coca 15, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 5, Jaguar 9, Lobo 3, Lobo 4, Mono 1, Oso 1, Payamino 13, Payamino 15, Payamino 18 and Estacion Payamino.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 805; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 169.\n\nIEMS ER II, p 153; Ecuador submitted that TULAS obliged the operator to remedy the underground water source as well as the corresponding affected soil if contaminants were found in concentrations above the thresholds in Table 5 (Counter-Memorial, paragraph 805; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 169).\n\n228.\n\nIEMS informed the Tribunal in its first report that since its investigation was ongoing it would present its overall estimation of remediation costs at a later date.527 Its preliminary estimate was US$ 405 million to remediate contaminated soil (Base Values) or US$ 243 million (regulatory limits), and a range of US$ 12 million to US$ 79 million for groundwater remediation.528\n\nIEMS ER I, p 26; Counter-Memorial, paragraph 786.\n\nIEMS ER I, p 70.\n\n229.\n\nAs noted above, the third stage of IEMS' investigation was identifying additional potentially contaminated sites based on recognised environmental conditions (\"RECs\"). In its first report IEMS reported that this stage was ongoing, but it had identified 44 more sites in addition to the 27 it had already concluded exhibited contamination that merited an assessment.529 These sites were located in the Coca, Gacela, Jaguar, Lobo, Oso, Mono, Payamino and Punino fields in Block 7, and the Yuralpa field in Block 21.530\n\nIEMS ER I, pp 3, 8 and 72. Note that the Respondent at paragraph 809 of its Counter-Memorial stated that IEMS had identified 37 potentially contaminated \"facilities\" (rather than sites) to investigate. The full list of sites can be found at IEMS ER I, pp 3-5 and Counter-Memorial, paragraph 809.\n\nIEMS ER I, pp 8-10.\n\n230.\n\nThese sites were the subject of IEMS' second report, which was produced in April 2012 and stood as a more comprehensive evaluation of the information it had collected from the 74 operational sites in Blocks 7 and 21...531 The results reflected \"more than 2,900 soil and underground water samples [collected] at different depths\" by IEMS.532 IEMS reported that it confirmed soil contamination in 70 out of the 74 sites studied (94% of the sites investigated).533 The sites were located in the Coca, Gacela, C\u00f3ndor Norte, Gacela, Jaguar, Lobo, Mono, Oso, Payamimo, Punino, Yuralpa, Chonta, Dayuno, Nemoca and Sumino fields.534 The volume of soil that IEMS quantified as requiring remediation was 1,086,883 m3 (Base Values) or 1,012,245 m3 (regulatory limits).535 As for groundwater contamination, it reported that 100% of the 18 sites it had tested yielded concentrations above the thresholds set by Ecuadorian regulations: in the Payamino, Coca, Oso, Gacela, Jaguar and Mono fields of Block 7 and the Yuralpa, Dayuno and Waponi fields of Block 21...536 It identified a further 52 sites that it intended to investigate for possible groundwater contamination.537\n\nIEMS ER II, p 1. \u2018Operational sites' were described by IEMS as sites it had been informed were worked by the Consortium (Burlington and Perenco), and included sites which were presently being operated by Petroamazonas (IEMS ER I, p 1).\n\nIEMS ER II, p 1.\n\nIEMS ER II, p 180.\n\nIEMS ER II, pp 138-142 for full list.\n\nIEMS ER II, pp 180-181.\n\nIEMS ER II, p 180; Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 176, 288-289.\n\nIEMS ER II, p 181.\n\n231.\n\nIn quantifying the volume of soil to be remediated, IEMS utilised ArcView GIS 10.0 software.538 IEMS drew a 10-meter radius around each sample (\"the buffer\") and defined the boundary of the area (\"the bounds\") by connecting the outer limits of the outermost buffers within a pl atform...539 It then added calculations for the volume to be estimated, modeling 6 different layers of depth (from 0 to 1 meter deep, 1.01-2 meters and so on).540 It assessed each layer separately, determining whether it contained contaminated soil on the basis of whether it contained at least 3 samples displaying contamination.541 If it contained less than 3 samples, \"these samples were not considered in the quantification model.\"542 IEMS then divided the area within each boundary into cells of 1 square meter each, categorised them (as either noncontaminated, contaminated with concentrations above Base Values but below the regulatory thresholds, or contaminated with concentrations above regulatory levels), and then applied the \u2018inverse distance weighed\" method of interpolation within ArcView GIS...543 This method estimated cell values \"by averaging the values of sample data points in the area surrounding each cell\", meaning that the closer a sampling point was to the centre of the cell being estimated, the more influence or weight it had in the average.544\n\nIEMS ER II, Annex A.8 (developed by ESRIT).\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 171; see IEMS ER II, Annex A.8.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 172; Reply, paragraph 191.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 172; Reply, paragraph 191.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 172; Reply, paragraph 191.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 173; Reply, paragraphs 191-192.\n\nReply, paragraph 192.\n\n232.\n\nIn total, IEMS determined that its estimated cost of remediation amounted to US$ 2,200,480.958 (base values case) or US$ 895,553,066 (regulatory case) for soil remediation, adding to this water remediation at a range of US$ 41,277,600 (best case scenario) to US$ 265,601,700 (worst case scenario).545 These costs were premised on *ex-situ* remediation546 (with the exception of the best case scenario method for groundwater remediation), based on \"the treatment costs suggested by the Federal Remediation Technologies Roundtable (FRTR) and other international bibliographical sources.\"547 Its breakdown of estimated cost according to the kind of contamination was as follows:\n\n(i) Soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons: US $280 per cubic metre of soil. This is \"between the ranges of costs for the remediation of similar contaminated soils by treatments of the same type that IEMS ha[d] recently used.\"548\n\n(ii) Soils contaminated with heavy metals: US$ 320 per cubic metre of soil. This was arrived at on the \"basis of the works conducted by IEMS and its commercial partners in various projects in Latin America (particularly in Mexico) during the last 5 years.\"549\n\n(iii) Soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals: US$ 240 per cubic metre of soil. This was based \"partially\" \"on information provided orally by providers of remediation work in the area.\"550\n\n(iv) Contamination of groundwater: The best and worst case scenario related to two different methods for the treatment of underground water, using cost estimates taken from studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States of America.551 The worst case scenario was based on the Pump and Treat System, which consists of extracting contaminated underground water for *ex situ* treatment, and quantified at an average yearly cost of US$ 9,870,000.552 The best case scenario was based on the Permeable Reactive Interceptive Barriers method, an *in-situ* treatment requiring, as its name suggests, installation below the surface of a barrier to remove contaminants as water flows through it.553 This method cost an estimated US$ 1,680,000 per year.554\n\nIEMS ER II, p 181, Annex T. IEMS sought an additional US$ 3,380,000 for groundwater tests. Reply, section 2.2.2; Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 305-311; IEMS ER II, Annex R.11. IEMS stated that since 100% of the locations it tested for underground water contamination was positive, it was of the view that all the remaining production facilities of Blocks 7 and 21 should be tested. It identified the cost of undertaking such a comprehensive evaluation as a further US$ 3,380, 000. (Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 311.) Finally, aside from soil and water pollution in the Blocks, IEMS noted environmental damage in the form of deforestation, reduction in air quality and noise pollution were also likely effects of oilfield operations but were difficult to quantify (IEMS ER II, p 3).\n\nIEMS ER II, pp 166-179.\n\nIEMS ER II, p 168, Annex R.\n\nIEMS ER II, p 170.\n\nIEMS ER II, p 172.\n\nIEMS ER II, p 173 and footnote 36 (\"IEMS, understands, however, that these providers do not provide all of the services required for a remediation consistent with the standards which truly allow for a protection of the environment (and which are used in other countries), and, therefore, its costs only constitute part of the total cost considered.\").\n\nIEMS ER II, p 174; see Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 300 (\".according to the US Army Corps of Engineers and US EPA's publication *A Guide to Developing and Documenting Costs Estimates During the Feasibility Study* (EPA-540-R-00-002 dated July 2000)\") [Italics in original.].\n\nIEMS ER II, p 174.\n\nIEMS ER II, p 174.\n\nIEMS ER II, p 175.\n\n233.\n\nAdded to this was an \"environmental monitoring cost\" of US$ 500, a 30% contingency factor for soil remediation, and for groundwater remediation, a \"dismantling cost.and restoration cost\" of 5% to 15% of the estimated cost and a similar contingency factor of 30%.555\n\nThis not exhaustive: IEMS ER II, pp 169 and 177; see also, Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 300-304, 418. In total, Ecuador concluded on the basis of IEMS' evidence that to remediate 1,867,835 (background) or 691,444 (regulatory) cubic metres of soil it would cost a maximum of US $2,279,544.559 (Base Values) and a minimum of US $831,363,368 (regulatory criteria).\n\n234.\n\nIn response, Perenco's expert, GSI, contended that Ecuador's claim of widespread environmental damage was completely unfounded and inconsistent with objective contemporaneous evidence.556 In its first report of 20 September 2012, GSI noted that it had been tasked to \"provide an objective evaluation of the work conducted by IEMS and, at the same time, achieve a comprehensive assessment of current environmental conditions for each of the 74 oilfield facilities investigated by IEMS.\"557\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 232; GSI ER I, paragraphs 2-11.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 233; GSI ER I, paragraphs 2-4.\n\n235.\n\nGSI explained that its investigation began with a review of IEMS' first and second reports in order to \"identify locations where soil impacts may be present based on applicable Ecuador criteria and to characterize apparent data gaps, errors and deficiencies\" in IEMS' work.558 This was followed by a \"detailed visual and physical inspection\" of 58 facilities, this including \"54 of the 55 facilities for which IEMS had made claims regarding soil remediation costs per their \u2018regulatory' criteria (i.e., all 55 sites except the Dayuno well site, due to access restrictions).\"559 GSI used this information for its sampling and testing campaign, undertaking field investigations in the Blocks from March through to June 2012, collecting soil samples at 24 sites and groundwater samples at 16 sites.560 GSI analysed sampling results both from its own and IEMS' fieldwork, amounting to a total of 3,194 soil samples and 113 groundwater samples.561 It screened IEMS' test results in the first instance by using the \"primary indicators of oilfield m ateri al s\"562: TPH (or Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons), barium, electrical conductance or chloride.563 It used the sampling results it considered relevant to delineate those areas where \"chemicals related to oilfield activities are present in soil or groundwater at concentrations in excess of applicable Ecuador regulatory criteria.\"564\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 3.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 233, and GSI ER I, paragraphs 2-4, Appendix D, Table D.10 and D.11.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 4.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 235; GSI ER I, paragraphs 4-5 (\"These campaigns included soil sampling at a total of 24 sites, groundwater sampling at 16 sites, and other miscellaneous sampling activities that, in combination with the prior analyses conducted by IEMS, comprise a database of 3194 soil samples, 113 groundwater samples, 18 sheen samples, 11 soil leachate samples from within closed mud/cuttings pits, 8 samples of crude oil, and 8 samples of produced water.\"), Appendix D, Table D.19.\n\nGSI ER I, section 2.4.3. It defined indicator paragrameters as \"chemicals or groups of chemicals that are present at significant concentrations in the source material and are readily detectable by field or laboratory analysis.\"\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 36-38 (addressed below in more detail).\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 5.\n\n236.\n\nGSI concluded there was \"no evidence of widespread adverse environmental or ecological effects in the Blocks\", and what environmental impact there was in the Blocks was minimal and in volumes and intensity that posed no danger to human health or the environment.565 In this connection, it asserted that Ecuadorian regulatory criteria were \"more stringent than internationally accepted health-based screening levels.\"566 It reported that 53 of the 74 facilities investigated by IEMS were in fact \"free of environmental impacts, as defined based upon applicable regulations and health-based screening levels.\"567 In the remaining sites, GSI discovered some incidence of concentrations of oilfield related chemicals in excess of regulatory limits: \"[f]ive principal facilities (Payamino 2-8, Payamino 1, Mono CPF, Gacela 1-8 and Coca 18-19) present[ed] impacted soil volumes of 1000 cubic meters (m3) or more, while smaller soil volumes are present at an additional 11 sites, corresponding to a total soil volume of approximately 33,415 m3 for all sites combined.\"568 Its preliminary estimate for the cost of remediating the soil at these sites was US$ 9.1 million,569 based on \"the actual costs for engineering, labor, equipment, and related remediation services in Ecuador\" and reflecting onsite containment and remediation procedures.570\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 219-22, Table 3.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 7.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 6.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 7: GSI noted that \"[a]t 5 additional sites (which represent less than 2% of the IEMS soil remediation claim), data presented by IEMS suggest that small volumes of soils in excess of applicable Ecuador limits may be present; however, in the time available for our field program, GSI did not conduct sampling and testing to confirm or delineate the extent of impacted soils at these 5 locations.\"\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 8, 219, Table 3. Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 236. GSI stated this would rise to US$ 9.87 million if the closure of 4 unused open pits (US$ 0.07 million) and the well plugging and abandonment of 7 wells (US$ 0.70 million) was included. (GSI ER I, paragraph 11(6)).\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 11(6). GSI added that \"[e]xcavation, treatment, and disposal costs are based upon government-approved remediation contractors that are presently conducting similar work for many oil and gas operators in the Oriente region, including the Ecuador state-owned operators, Petroamazonas and Petroecuador.\"\n\n237.\n\nGSI qualified this estimate in asserting that remediation may not be necessary because \"no risk is posed to human health at any of these locations and the majority of the soil impacts (95% of cost) are related to causes that pre-date current regulatory standards, as well as Consortium operations.\"571 GSI further submitted that approximately 76% of the total soil remediation costs were related to events that occurred \"prior to October 1990.\"572 In addition, GSI reported that it had found no groundwater impacts in the 18 sites identified by IEMS, and asserted that IEMS' findings resulted from \"incorrect sampling methods.\"573\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 8.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 8.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 9.\n\n238.\n\nGSI employed a delineation approach to estimate the volume of soil that required remediation.574 It explained that this method included linear interpolation amongst sampling points, rather than applying the \"inverse distance weighted\" method as IEMS did, and all the while accounted for the surrounding topography and site features.575 This method meant \"starting with any sample point that show[ed] an exceedance and then taking more samples surrounding that point, continuing to step outwards until clean soil [was] found.\"576 GSI said that it performed this for each of the 1 metre depths that IEMS considered and which GSI identified depicted sampling results that merited an assessment.577 GSI submitted that in contrast to IEMS' \"hypothetical projections\" in its inverse distance weighted interpolation, its method was based on \"abundant actual data\", making \"use of *all* the samples - including all of IEMS' own data - as well as real topographic and other features particular to each site.\"578\n\nGSI ER I, p 5, Appendix D.\n\nGSI ER I, Appendix D, D.5.1.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 12.\n\nGSI ER I, Appendix D, D.5.1.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 12; GSI ER I, Appendix D, D.2.1.3 [Emphasis in original.].\n\n239.\n\nA significant portion of GSI's report was devoted to its review of IEMS' expert evidence in its first and second reports.579 GSI asserted that the methodology that IEMS had adopted to locate, investigate and model samples in the Blocks were marked by \"pervasive and systematic flaws.\"580\n\nGSI ER I, section 3, pp 29-63.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18-19, 231-239. Outside of those set out in detail in the following paragraphs, GSI in its first report at paragraph 154 lists several other flaws it submitted affected IEMS' findings.\n\n240.\n\nFirst, GSI asserted that its use of \"indicator parameters\" was to be preferred to the approach taken by IEMS.581 It identified three primary sources of potential environmental effects in the oil production process.582 These were drilling muds, crude oil and formation water.583\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 225.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 60.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n241.\n\nDrilling muds were used to lubricate and loosen the earth through which the drill bit must pass, and once that has been achieved are pulled back up to the surface along with chunks of soil, crushed rock and small traces of crud e...584 GSI observed that in the early 1990s, the then-practice in Ecuador of discharging the mud cuttings into the surrounding environment was suspended, and operators were required to contain the substances in specially prepared \"mud pits\" in order for them to be re-vegetated.585 Drilling mud can be water-based (generally consisting of water, bentonite and barite) or oil-based (diesel).586 Water-based muds, which are commonly used in Ecuador, can contain large quantities of barium sulphate or barite.587 Thus, it is natural to find quantities of barium in mud pits.588\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 16(1); 1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraph 172; Claimant's CounterMemorial, paragraph 68.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 170, 173, 181-187; GSI ER I, paragraph 16(1); Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 70-72.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 16(1); Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 67-68.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 34(3); Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 69.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 225; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 68-69.\n\n242.\n\nTurning to the second possible source of contamination, when a well is initially drilled, it produces \"test crude\", which is crude used to determine the well's production capacity and the quality of the oil.589 In GSI's opinion, the only relevant measurement for detecting the presence of test crude was to test for \"Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons\" or \" **TPH** \" in the surrounding soil and groundwater.590 (\"TPH\" refers to hydrocarbon compounds derived from petroleum.591):\n\nAs a basis for design of our field sampling program, the IEMS soil test results were carefully reviewed to identify locations where soil impacts are present or absent, based upon consideration of applicable Ecuador regulatory criteria. For characterization of oilfield-related soil impacts, the IEMS soil test results for the *primary indicators of oilfield materials (i.e., barium for drilling mud; TPH for crude oil; soil electrical conductance for produced water)* were compared to Ecuador regulatory criteria for the relevant land use. *The presence of other chemicals in the soil, in the absence of a primary indicator (e.g., nickel in the absence of elevated barium or TPH), cannot be caused by an oilfield material and was therefore not retained for further investigation*... Similarly, soil test results from within closed mud/ cuttings pits were not considered evidence of soil impacts, as these closed pits are specifically authorized and required under applicable Ecuador regulations (Acuerdo 621, Decree 2982, and RAOH Decree 1215) and the government-approved Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for oilfield operations in the Consortium area.\n\nEvaluation of the full IEMS database of soil tests results provides the following information regarding the nature of potential soil impacts among the 1243 soil sample locations collected outside of closed mud/ cuttings pits (excluding the 192 clean soil samples used by IEMS for characterization of background soil conditions):\n\n\u2022 No Evidence of Soil Impact by Oilfield Materials : ***91%*** of soil sample locations\n\n\u2022 Apparent Drilling Mud Impact : ***6%*** of soil sample locations (elevated barium, outside of proper mud/ cuttings pit)\n\n\u2022 Apparent Crude Oil Impact : ***4%*** of soil sample locations (elevated TPH)\n\n\u2022 Apparent Drilling Mud and Crude Oil Impact at Same Location : ***0.7%***  of soil sample locations\n\n\u2022 Apparent Produced Water Salinity Impact : ***0.1\u00b0%*** of soil sample locations (elevated electrical conductance)\n\nThese data show that, at the vast majority of the IEMS soil sample locations (91%), there is no evidence of impact by oilfield materials.\"592\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 16(2); Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 74.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 36, 225; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 76.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 76.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 181(1) [Emphasis added in italics, underlining and bold in original]; Reply, paragraph 73.\n\n243.\n\nIn arguing that the only relevant indicators of contamination from oilfield operations was TPH, barium (for drilling mud) and soil electrical conductance (for produced water),593 GSI differed from IEMS, which considered that the presence of heavy metals in the soil could also result from drilling operations.594 GSI disagreed with IEMS on this, arguing that crude oil was not a significant source of heavy metals and, asserting that in fact \"the crude produced in Blocks 7 and 21 contain[ed] far less heavy metal content than the area's soils.\"595 It asserted that IEMS' allegations of contamination by heavy metals could not be correct because none of these metals other than barium exist in any oilfield materials (crude, produced water, or drilling muds) in concentrations above the naturally occurring levels found in local soils.596\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 181(1).\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 225(1) cf. IEMS ER III, p 3.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 225; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 77.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 225(1): \"[T]he concentrations of barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel and vanadium measures in 8 samples of crude oil collected from 6 production stations in the CPUF, Block 7 and Block 21 are significantly less than the background concentrations of these metals in clean natural soils in this area. This finding is consistent with many prior investigations of crude oil composition, which demonstrate that metals are not a significant component of crude oils.\" Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 238 and 270; cf. IEMS ER II, p 3.\n\n244.\n\nGSI noted further that there were other types of naturally occurring hydrocarbons in the environment that were unrelated to petroleum exploitation.597 A certain level of TPH may be naturally present in the environment due to the presence of decaying carbon, such as rotting plant matter.598\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 76.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 76; and Exhibit CE-CC-241, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Coca Complex, Block 7, June 2010, Section 3, p 18 (2010 environmental study commissioned by Petroamazonas, noting that \"[t]he TPH values of 183, 250, 132, and 157 mg/kg [in the soil samples]... must correspond to the organic material in the upper levels of the samples.\").\n\n245.\n\nThirdly, a fluid known as \"formation water\" or \"production water\" is produced by wells throughout their operational lives.599 The presence of formation water in soil is marked by high concentrations of chloride and high electrical conductivity.600 Formation water was at one time discharged into the environment, but in the late 1990s, operators began re-injecting it into wells.601 GSI explained that Oryx began using this method \"near the end of its operatorship of Block 7 in 1997\" and the Consortium \"subsequently implemented a comprehensive reinjection program, repurposing or drilling multiple wells as injection wells.\"602 Thus, throughout Perenco's operation of the blocks, formation water was not being discharged but rather was being reinjected into the wells. In any event, GSI asserted that the formation water produced in Blocks 7 and 21 did not contain significant amounts of heavy metals.603\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 16(3); Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 80.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 225; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 83\n\n1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraph 297; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 82.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 297-298; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 82.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 225; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 83.\n\n246.\n\nAside from the alleged conceptual flaw in IEMS' even employing a \"background values\" case, GSI challenged IEMS' method for calculating the \"background values\", stating \"because [it] calculates these supposed \u2018background values' as the *average* level at which the particular compounds occur in soil samples taken from unaffected areas, Ecuador is effectively contending that even some of the admittedly unaffected natural soil is actually \u2018contaminated' and requires remediation simply because it contains \u2018above average' levels of naturally occurring compounds.\"604 Instead of using the upper range of the observed sampling results from its \"clean soil samples\", IEMS had calculated the 99% upper confidence limit which \"represents a small margin of uncertainty added onto the mean concentration, resulting in an adjusted mean concentration that is slightly above the average, but far below the upper range of concentrations observed in clean samples.\"605 As a result, IEMS \"erroneously declared\" 80% of the \"clean soils at all sites to be \u2018contaminated.'\"606\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 13 [Italics in original], 274, referring to GSI ER I, paragraphs 92-93, Appendix I; Rejoinder, paragraphs 96, 101-111.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 92-94.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 94.\n\n247.\n\nGSI also asserted that IEMS mischaracterised areas that were \"almost entirely \u2018industrial' or \u2018agricultural' zones - with permissible threshold limits suitable to such areas - as more demanding \u2018sensitive ecosystems'.\"607 \"Approximately two-thirds of the samples that Ecuador claimed show[ed] \u2018contamination' under these incorrect criteria (\u2018sensitive ecosystems') were in fact fully compliant under proper land use criteria (\u2018industrial' or \u2018agricultural')\", this accounting for over US$885 million of Ecuador's US$2.4 billion claim.608\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 15, 277-311, referring to GSI ER I, paragraph 11(7); Rejoinder, paragraph 97.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 16-17, 277-282; GSI ER I, paragraph 11(7). GSI submitted that IEMS' failure to apply the correct regulatory criteria resulted in the incorrect categorization of 568 samples as contaminated: GSI ER I, paragraph 11(7), Exhibit 3.\n\n248.\n\nAs previously noted, RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS Table 3 present multiple sets of criteria, and the permissible limits for industrial land use are more permissive than those for agricultural land use, and in turn for \u2018sensitive ecosystems'. Perenco contended that the land in and around the oilfield sites in Blocks 7 and 21 were either used for an industrial or an agricultural purpose.609 This was said to be consistent with RAOHE, Table 6, which pointed to the \"posterior use that will be given to the remediated soil\", and referred specifically to the Heritage of State Natural Areas (*Patrimonio de \u00c1reas Naturales del Estado*), and Ecuador's own practice.610 Examples of Ecuadorian authorities' having accepted the application of *industrial* land-use criteria in Blocks 7 and 21 were to be found in the January 2003 Remediation Plan relating to the Payamino Sanitary Landfill, Payamino 22, Payamino CPF, Coca CPF and Jaguar CPF approved by the Ministry,611 the report of a clean-up of a spill at Payamino 19 in June 2009,612 the Consortium's Environmental Impact Study for the construction of the Oso A and Oso B platforms and the Yuralpa Norte platform in April and October 2006,613 and in the environmental impact studies commissioned by Ecuador in 2010...614\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 279.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 283, section III.B.2(c). Perenco submitted that the majority of its operations in Blocks 7 and 21 would result in the classification of the land-use as industrial (Claimant's CounterMemorial, paragraph 289). Examples of practice of Ecuadorian authorities applying industrial criteria at paragraphs 292-297 of its Counter-Memorial.\n\nExhibits CE-CC-51, Letter of January 28, 2003 from Perenco to DINAPA, attaching the Remediation Program for Block 7, including Coca-Payamino field; CE-CC-54, Letter of April 22, 2003 from Perenco to DINAPA, p 1; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 292.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 293, referring to Exhibit CE-CC-86, Sandblasting, Painting, and Mechanical Repairs to Gacela Station Tank (101-Tk).\n\nExhibit CE-CC-110, Environmental Impact Study for the Construction of Platforms Oso A and Oso B, Access Road, and Drilling and Production Activities in Block 7, April 2006; CE-CC-122, Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for the Construction of the Yuralpa Norte Platform, Access Road, and Drilling and Production Activities, October 2006; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 294.\n\nExhibits CE-CC-241, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Coca Complex, Block 7, June 2010, section 3, p 17 (EIS contracted by Petroamazonas for Coca, Payamino and Gacela fields); CE-CC-242, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Mono Complex, Block 7, June 2010, section 3.1.6.2, pp 15-17 (EIS contracted by Petroamazonas for Mono and Jaguar fields); CE-CC-236, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for the Oso Complex in Block 7 and the Drilling of Three Additional Wells in Oso A, June 2010 section 3.1.6.3 (EIS contracted by Petroamazonas for Oso field).\n\n249.\n\nSimilarly, examples of Ecuadorian authorities' having accepted the application of *agricultural* land-use criteria to the areas surrounding platforms in Blocks 7 and 21 were in the Ministry-approved remediation plan for the May 2007 spill from the Oso 2 flow line,615 the January 2008 Ministry-approved remediation plan for a spill in the Gacela-Payamino flow line in October 2007,616 and in the environmental impact studies commissioned by Ecuador in 2010.617\n\nExhibits CE-CC-116, Letter of June 4, 2006 from the Consortium to DINAPA; CE-CC-153, Letter of January 11, 2008 from the Consortium to DINAPA; CE-CC-138, Letter of August 14, 2007 from Ministry of Mines and Petroleum to the Consortium; CE-CC-197, Letter of February 11, 2009 from the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection to the Consortium.\n\nExhibits CE-CC-140, Letter of October 8, 2007 from the Consortium to DINAPA; CE-CC-151, Letter of January 10, 2008 from the Consortium to Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection; CE-CC-203, Letter of February 25, 2009 from the Consortium to DINAPA.\n\nExhibits CE-CC-241, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Coca Complex, Block 7, June 2010, section 3, pp 79-81; CE-CC-242, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Mono Complex, Block 7, June 2010, section 3, pp 51, 175 (Mono, Jaguar and Condor fields featured crops and livestock).\n\n250.\n\nPerenco contended moreover that IEMS had conceded in this arbitration that the areas surrounding Coca 6, Coca 8, Lobo 3, Lobo 1, Oso 9, Mono CPF, and Payamino CPF were used for agriculture.618 GSI submitted that its assessment of the land-use surrounding each platform revealed that \"95% of the areas surrounding the inspected platforms constitute[d] agricultural areas or secondary forests.\"619\n\nIEMS ER II, Annex H, pp 7, 56, 60, 78; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 300-311; 1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraph 74.\n\nGSI ER I, Appendix C, p 3, paragraph 197; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 302-304. Perenco further submitted that Ecuadorian authorities had up till the point of this proceeding treated the land surrounding the platforms as attracting agricultural land-use criteria (Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 304-308).\n\n251.\n\nPerenco and GSI submitted that the \u2018sensitive ecosystems' criteria would at best apply only to a \"tiny number of sites in the Blocks [which] intersect with designated \u2018sensitive ecosystem' areas, and even within those areas, the land use is actually agricultural - not a nature preserve.\"620 These sites were: Payamino CPF, Payamino 1, Payamino 2-8, Payamino 19, Waponi-Ocatoe and Nemoca.621 The Payamino sites were examples of sites that intersected with a protected area but which in fact were used for industry and agriculture.622\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 278-279; 1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 75-77.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 284.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 285; 1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 75-77 (Mr. Saltos testified that Certificates of Intersection were \"a key component in determining whether an area constitutes a protected area.\" They are administrative acts issued by the Ministry of the Environment through which the Government certifies whether a specific area intersects with the National System of Protected Areas, Protective Forests and Forest Assets of the State. He raised an example of a Certificate of Intersection for Lobo 3 when the Consortium attempted to drill three additional wells on the platform. It provided the Ministry with the coordinates and the Ministry, on 13 December 2005, certified that the area did not intersect (Exhibits CE-CC-102; see also, CE-CC-39 (Yuralpa CPF)). Mr. Saltos admitted that \"limited portions of the Blocks intersect with protected areas, but this does not mean that the entire extension of the Blocks should be treated as sensitive ecosystem.\" (1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 75-77).\n\n252.\n\nGSI applied sensitive ecosystems criteria to \"the small amount of land that f[ell] within a designated protected area, despite the fact that the actual land use [did] not accord with the designation\", correlating to 89 of IEMS' 1243 sampling locations.623 It otherwise applied agricultural or industrial land-use criteria in its analysis.624\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 288, footnote 352; GSI ER I, Appendix F.5.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 288, 300-311.\n\n253.\n\nGSI asserted further that IEMS had \"systematically manipulated laboratory data\" by assigning positive values to samples that in fact reported no detectable presence of target compound.625 For example, \"if the detection limit for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (\"TPH\") [was] 200 mg/kg, and the laboratory actually found no detectable presence of TPH, IEMS nevertheless identified the sample as containing a contamination of 199.99 mg/kg of TPH\".626 GSI asserted that this was in breach of accepted protocols, which in the event that a laboratory reports \"non-detectable\", requires the sample to be labeled as \"clean.\"627 GSI contended that this \"infected *79%* of the results\" or 2082 of the 2620 soil samples represented in its first and second reports.628 In this connection, GSI challenged IEMS' classification of samples as presenting concentrations above the detection limit but below \"background values\" as a \"low impact\", stating that under common use of the term \"soil would only be considered \u2018impacted' if the concentration exceeded both the regulatory limit and natural background\", this corresponding to the \"final \u2018highly impacted' tier of the IEMS classification system.\"629\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 18; GSI ER I, section 3.3.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 18; GSI ER I, section 3.3.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 75.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 380, 397-404 [Emphasis in original]; GSI ER I, paragraphs 74-75 cf. IEMS ER II, Annex I.3.a.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 75-76.\n\n254.\n\nIEMS was also alleged to have \"systematically\" treated the contents of \"clearly defined \u2018pits'\", which are \"areas specially constructed - with Ecuador's approval - to hold oil drilling byproducts, especially so-called \u2018drilling muds' that contain heavy metals like barium\", as if they were \"regular soil.\"630 It took samples from inside closed mud pits, applied the testing methodology for regular soil instead of that applicable to mud pits, namely leachate testing, and compared the results to the permissible levels for regular soil in RAOHE Table 6 rather than for leachates from mud pits in Table 7.631 The significance of this is that IEMS came to the \"conclusion that the areas [were] \u2018contaminated' when in fact they simply contain[ed] the very compounds that they [were] supposed to contain under Ecuadorian law.\"632 This invalidated any samples IEMS took from inside *closed* pits, that is, pits that had already been converted with Ministry approval into containment areas to prevent migration of contaminants, this representing \"22% of the 2,629 samples\" in question.633\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 313-333; relying on GSI ER I, paragraphs 108-110; Rejoinder, paragraphs 98, 128-140.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 313-333.

In Perenco's view, mud pits are to be tested using a different methodology and criteria under RAOHE, Table 7, rather than Table 6, because they are designed to contain the discharge of industrial substances stemming from the drilling process, and naturally contain concentrations of barium higher than that found in the surrounding soil.634 Thus, Table 7 permits higher levels of an environmental impact than Table 6 permits. Perenco submitted that Ecuadorian authorities had historically acknowledged this and applied the Table 7 regulatory criteria to the investigation of mud pits, such as in the case of the 2008 environmental audit of Block 7.635 IEMS did likewise in its expert report in the *City Oriente* proceeding.636\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 318-321, Section II.A.2(a).\n\nCf. Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 3: \".instead of applying the criteria applicable to soil contamination in sensitive ecosystems, Perenco's audits applied those relating to agricultural and industrial areas\", and footnote 162 \"The 2008 Environmental Audits considered that there was soil pollution and, consequently, a duty to remediate only where contaminants were found in concentrations above the thresholds set out in the RAOHE, (Annex 2, Table 6) for \u2018soil for agricultural use'\".\n\nExhibit CE-CC-182/E-144, Biannual Environmental Audit of Block 7 and Coca-Payamino Unified Field, Two Years Prior to the Expiration of the Block 7 Participation Contract, November 2008, pp 67-68; CE-CC-169, IEMS Environmental Evaluation Report for the Hydrocarbons Activities of City Oriente Ltd., Block 27, submitted in *City Oriente v.

IEMS ER II, p 7.\n\n259.\n\nGSI also contended that IEMS' estimation of the volume of allegedly contaminated soil was exaggerated and significantly in error as a result of the misuse of the ArcView GIS Spatial Analyst software.643 The software is designed to \" *interpolate* between two points\" but \"IEMS programmed it to *extrapolate* from a given point outwards without any constraining boundary\", and as a result \"falsely depict[ed] vast and sweeping areas of contamination\" which included areas in which no soil sampling had been taken that demonstrated an exceedance or which defied sampling results that depicted no contamination, and all the while ignoring the actual topography of the area which would influence how the contamination might naturally spread.644\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 379, 383-396; Rejoinder, section II(A)(3).\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 379, 383-396 [Italics in original]; GSI ER I, paragraphs 77, 120-129.\n\n260.\n\nGSI explained that the mapping algorithm of the software, the \"Inverse-Distance Weighted Averaging\" or IDW, is intended for use \"in interpolation *between* measured data position, with very limited extrapolation *beyond* the immediate area of the sample locations.\"645 It added that IDW was \"very poor\" at extrapolation, but that is precisely what IEMS used it towards with the result that their modeling was \"extrapolation to extreme distances beyond the footprint of their data points.\"646\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 120.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 121-124; cf. IEMS ER I, Annex A.8; 2nd IEMS, Annex A.8.\n\n261.\n\nThus, the manner in which the bounds of each site within the model are drawn stood to have a compounding impact on the extent of the contamination marked by the software. Examining IEMS' method, GSI reported that they assumed that each soil sample represented concentrations within a 10-meter radius \u2018buffer area\" surrounding the data point, which it represented by circles inscribed around each sampling location.647 This despite the fact that \"many of the soil samples collected by IEMS within 10 m of each other display[ed] very different chemical concentrations.\"648 IEMS then drew a \u2018boundary' \"corresponding to a rectangular area drawn tangential to the outermost buffer areas\" within a site, and programmed the software to extrapolate and fill in the area.649 In programming the software, IEMS input parameters which resulted in its extrapolating and filling in the boundary area with model soil \"impacts\" which in many cases ignored the fact that there was no data or the data showed no such condition.650\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 122.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 122-123.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 124-129.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 125.\n\n262.\n\nGSI claimed that this method was \"novel and unique to IEMS and [was] not supported by either publications or common standards of practice for geostatistical mapping.\"651 This led Perenco to assert that this erroneous approach, coupled with other errors discussed in this section, \"invalidate[d] *every single one* of IEMS' soil volume calculations.\"652 Proper delineation, incorporating the topography and using compliant samples to define the boundaries of the contaminated area, would produce results which, in GSI's opinion, established volumes of contamination that at best amounted to 1% or 2% of the volumes presented by IEMS for the same sites.653\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 122-124.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 383-396 [Italics in original]; GSI ER I, paragraphs 117-119.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 120-127, Table 3; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 384-395.\n\n263.\n\nGSI then asserted that IEMS had \"systematically failed to properly filter groundwater samples\", resulting in the laboratory results' reflecting particulates of which were essentially soil and, as such, producing values which were \"scientifically impossible\", thereby \"invalidat[ing] *all* of IEMS' groundwater samples.\"654 When GSI sampled groundwater using the correct filtration methods, all of those samples were fully compliant.655\n\nGSI ER I, section 3.4; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 334-340; Rejoinder, paragraphs 100, 144-156.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 79, 83, 226-228; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 334-340.\n\n264.\n\nIn order to properly sample groundwater, technical guidelines require that the samples be clear of soil particles.656 Annex 5 of RAOHE provides that the methodology for testing the presence of heavy metals in water shall include filtration.657 GSI inspected the monitoring wells left in place by IEMS and \"confirm[ed] that they [did] not conform to industry standards for groundwater sampling.\"658 This gave rise to unreliable sampling results because when IEMS added nitric acid preservative in order to stabilise dissolved metal concentrations prior to testing, the acid dissolved the solid sediment particles that had been trapped, thereby exponentially elevating the metal concentrations to levels that could not be naturally present in water.659 For example, IEMS reported barium levels in its groundwater results as high as 8.28 mg/L, when in fact the maximum solubility limit for barium sulfate in groundwater is 3.1 mg/L.660\n\nGSI ER I, section 3.4, paragraph 85.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Annex 5; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 335.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 336; GSI ER I, paragraph 84.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 337-339; GSI ER I, paragraph 230; Rejoinder, paragraph 145.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 81; cf. IEMS ER II, p 156, Table IV-12 (groundwater results for Mono CPF).\n\n265.\n\nMoreover, IEMS failed to apply the correct regulatory criteria to the results of its groundwater tests.661 It used the reference criteria of TULAS, Book VI, Annex 1, Table 5, which GSI explained applied only to water obtained from soil with a clay content of less than 25% and an organic material content less than 10%.662 IEMS applied Table 5 to all of its samples regardless of the type of soil from which the sample was obtained: \"Review of geologic logs from locations at or near the groundwater monitoring wells (available for 49 IEMS groundwater sample points) shows that, at 56% of the IEMS groundwater sampling locations, the soil composition [was] primarily clay.\"663\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 86.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 86.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 86.\n\n266.\n\nGSI sampled 15 of the locations identified by IEMS, and reported that their tests confirmed that the presence of metal compounds above the Ecuadorian regulatory standards occurred \"entirely as a result of extraneous soil particles.\"664 For these reasons, Perenco submitted that Ecuador's claim for remediation of contaminated groundwater lacked any foundation.665\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 86, 182 and 229; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 339.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 334-340.\n\n267.\n\nFinally, GSI challenged IEMS' remediation cost estimates as wholly unsupported, asserting IEMS had failed to \"cite a single source for remediation cost estimates in Ecuador, or justify the enormous percentages added for alleged planning and contingency.\"666 IEMS ignored actual cost data for the clean-up of sites by companies operating within Ecuador.667 GSI submitted that a reasonable and justifiable estimate was \"in fact below US$100 per cubic meter\", but IEMS' average remediation unit price was US$280 per cubic meter, this in turn inflating its claim \"by over *400%.* \"668\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 381, 405-433; Rejoinder, paragraphs 200-216.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 14 (\"Even the very minimal evidence of local costs that IEMS has submitted with its Reply is far below IEMS' cost estimates.

Third expert report of IEMS and second expert report of RPS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nIEMS' third report, submitted in February 2013, responded to GSI's criticisms and confirmed the reliability of its modeling and the results it produced as reported in its first and second reports (with the exception of three errors).669 IEMS explained that it undertook a fourth site inspection following the receipt of GSI's report, and collected additional soil samples at 22 sites.670 It asserted that, as a result, \"[w]ith the exception of a few spreadsheet errors, GSI's contentions are without merit and IEMS' conclusions as to the extent of contamination and the costs of remediation are correct.\"671 In its view, GSI had relied upon a \"false and misleading methodology and, hence, reached incorrect conclusions in their misplaced attempts to downplay the full extent of the environmental damage\" in Blocks 7 and 21.672\n\nIEMS ER III, p 3. Reply, section 2.2.1; Ecuador explained that \"minor corrections\" were required for the values inputted into the modeling for Payamino CPF/Payamino 1 (total estimated volume above background levels is 187,104 m3 (formerly 192,593 m3, a reduction of 5,489 m3), and the estimated volume above regulatory reference criteria is 40,513 m3 (formerly 92,597 m3, a reduction of 52,084 m3)), Yuralpa Pad A (less 21,420 m3 of barium), Coca CPF (less 8,246 m3), Coca 8 (less 279 m3), Dayuno (less 1,424 m3).\n\nIEMS ER III, pp 1-3.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 2; Reply, paragraph 5.\n\nReply, paragraph 5.\n\n269.\n\nEcuador also challenged GSI's credibility and in particular that of its President, Mr. John Connor.673 It alleged that: throughout \"his career, Mr. Connor has been at the service of private oil companies, systematically testifying in their favour and refusing to allocate liability for environmental harm\" and pointed specifically to work that Mr. Connor and GSI had done in the well-known dispute between Ecuador and Chevron which suggested that GSI had engaged in a results-driven exercise of looking only at clean samples in order to exonerate the party which had retained it.674\n\nReply, paragraphs 21-24.\n\nReply, paragraph 22. Cf Footnote 12.\n\n270.\n\nTurning to IEMS' third report, IEMS first asserted that the list of contaminants that it examined in the samples it collected were elements \"properly associated with oilfield activities\" and, in any event, represented the chemicals that the regulations were concerned with and \"set forth action levels for... without any requirement that these chemicals be associated with hydrocarbons, produced water or barium sulfate in order to call for remediation.\"675 In its view, GSI's approach rendered \"null and void\" key elements of RAOHE and TULAS.676 GSI's approach was said to be further contradicted by Perenco's own prior practice, as evidenced in an \u2018Environmental Protection Guide' it had produced during the course of its operatorship in which Perenco listed a total of 19 indicators including TPH, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.677\n\nIEMS ER III, p 2, section 3.1\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.1, pp 13-14.\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.1, p 14 referring to Attachment 3 to the report.\n\n271.\n\nSecond, IEMS defended its use of the upper end of the confidence interval of the mean concentrations of the 189 \u2018clean' soil samples it had tested in order to arrive at its background values.678 It asserted that its approach was consistent with RAOHE and TULAS, stating that it \"believes that the intent of the regulations is not merely to estimate the sample mean but also the true population mean.\"679 In order to arrive at a true population mean, the traditional approach would have been to collect and test all clean soil in the Blocks, but since IEMS could not practically perform such an exercise, the next best alternative was to apply confidence intervals.680 It asserted that by applying the upper end of the confidence interval, it was selecting a higher concentration and in so doing acting conservatively in the circumstances.681 It further argued that GSI's proposed method of arriving at background values was inconsistent with regulatory requirements in Ecuador.682\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.1, pp 15-18.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 15 [Emphasis in original].\n\nIEMS ER III, pp 16-17.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 17.\n\nIEMS ER III, pp 18-21.\n\n272.\n\nIEMS also responded to GSI's statement that Ecuadorian regulatory criteria were in fact more stringent than health-based screening levels, asserting the \"risk assessment performed by GSI is unacceptably flawed and biased\"; \"[i]t did not include ecological risk\" and it \"consider[ed] only one of several human exposure pathways necessary to fully evaluate the potential risk to human health.\"683\n\nIEMS ER III, p 47 (section 3.2.3.1).\n\n273.\n\nThird, IEMS asserted that, contrary to GSI's claims that drilling mud and the contents of mud pits were relatively innocuous and posed no significant health risk: \"[a]lthough barium sulfate is relatively insoluble under oxidizing conditions, it is fairly soluble in acidic and anaerobic conditions, which means that, variations in pH conditions could result in the dissolution of barium from barium sulfate; thereby, barium would be released to water and soil during the disposal of drilling wastes.\"684 Moreover, the relevant reference criteria were to be found in Table 6, not Table 7, of RAOHE because Table 7 applied only during the pit closure process and for a short period thereafter.685 IEMS challenged GSI's testing method, submitting that it collected \"samples of the clean soil covers that had been placed over the mud pits at the time of closure, which implie[d] that: 1) GSI samples represent only the quality of the clean soil surface; 2) GSI did not identify and therefore, did not know the toxicity of the waste disposed within pits, and 3) GSI misinterpreted their results equating the concentration of the cover soil to the fill material of the pits.\"686\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.2, p 25. IEMS added that GSI's statement that oil-based muds were rarely used in the blocks was a bald-faced assertion which it could not verify because \"the Consortium does not present the drilling records of the wells, or any other records demonstrating which pits are likely to contain the oil-based wastes, it is not reasonable to assert that the contents of the pits are similar to normal soils and benign.\" (p 25).\n\nIEMS ER III, p 27; see also, Ecuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 305.\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.2.3; Reply, paragraphs 91, 304-312; RPS ER II, section 2, p 8.\n\n274.\n\nIEMS further challenged GSI's use of Table 7(b) of RAOHE (criteria governing lined pits) rather than the more stringent limits established in Table 7(a) (governing unlined pits). It stated that the choice was \"unfounded, as there [was] no evidence of intact impermeable liners beneath [the] pits\" examined in Blocks 7 and 21, but there was evidence that the pits were not lined, or that their liners had seriously deteriorated.\n\n275.\n\nRPS, Ecuador's other expert, noted in this regard that GSI's use of Table 7(b) of RAOHE (criteria governing lined pits) ran afoul of the Consortium's own practice of applying Table 7(a). RPS cited examples of pit closure documents for Jaguar 9 from November 2000 and Coca 19 from October 2004 which referred to Table 7(a).687 RPS asserted that if GSI had applied Table 7(a) limits, it would have concluded that four of the seven pits that GSI had tested should be remediated.688\n\nReply, paragraphs 92-93; RPS ER II, section 5, pp 81-83; IEMS ER III, section 3.2.2.\n\nRPS ER II, section 5, pp 82-83; see Appendix A to Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief on Counterclaims dated 22 November 2013.\n\n276.\n\nIEMS submitted in addition that GSI ignored \"significant shortcomings\" in the Consortium's management of mud pits, inconsistent with their obligations under RAOHE and TULAS.689 The pits were constructed in disregard of applicable regulations,690 they were not monitored timeously, they were not tested timeously upon their closure (7 days, 3 months and 6 months after), and their contents were allegedly mixed with clean soil or water in order to dilute the contamination, a practice that TULAS prohibited.691 The consequences of such omissions by the Consortium had not been identified by GSI because of the unreliability of its method of investigating the pits in Blocks 7 and 21.692\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.2.\n\nCites the example of collapse of C\u00f3ndor Norte pit.\n\nReply, paragraph 39; IEMS ER III, section 3.2.2. The reference to TULAS is the reference to Article 4.2.1.3 which provides that \"[t]he use of any kind of water to dilute untreated liquid effluents is forbidden.\" (EL-146, TULAS).\n\nReply, section 2.1.3.2.\n\n277.\n\nIEMS asserted that GSI also incorrectly delineated the size of the pits and the areas that needed to be tested for leachates. Proper delineation was required to determine whether the pit was leaking contaminants. IEMS argued that GSI either presented the pits as being \"larger than they really are so as to give the impression that they [were] not leaking and that the pits and their surrounding areas accordingly require[d] no remediation\" or failed to act on evidence of contamination in area surrounding mud pits such as in the case of the Coca 8 pit where IEMS had proved exhibited serious contamination but GSI \"failed to meaningfully assess the source of the contamination.\"693\n\nReply, paragraphs 94-95; IEMS ER III, section 3.2.4.\n\n278.\n\nFourth, IEMS asserted that the GSI misinterpreted and misapplied the regulatory criteria applicable to the environment in the Blocks.694 \"GSI considered that the regulatory levels to be used were based on the *current* land use of the areas, completely ignoring the express provisions of Table 6 of the RAOHE (referring to the *future* land use).\"695 IEMS defended its use of the sensitive ecosystems criteria,696 stating that while areas in the Blocks may not be designated protected areas, their ecological studies suggested that most displayed characteristics \"similar to those of a National Natural Area.\"697 The fact that several sites are currently being operated or have been used for industrial purposes in the past is \"of no relevance to *future* land use.\"698\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.3.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 45 (italics in original); Exhibit EL-147, RAOHE, p 7 of PDF; see also, Reply, paragraphs 294-303; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 70-72 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nIEMS ER III, p 48: \"The activities performed during this fourth stage of the assessment confirmed that the area where Blocks 7 and 21 are located must be considered a sensitive ecosystem.\"\n\nIEMS ER III, p 41, see also, pp 41-47.\n\nReply, paragraph 297 [Emphasis in original].\n\n279.\n\nEcuador submitted that the significance of classifying the land based on future use was so as to \" *facilitate site reuse* \", a term taken from the lexicon of the US Environmental Protection Agency.699 Since the oilfields are \"carved out in the middle of the Amazonian jungle\", \"entirely surrounded by rainforest\" and their present use for oilfield operations will \"inevitably run out\" they are destined to be re-absorbed by the rainforest and can reasonably be anticipated to revert back to their natural, sensitive ecosystem state.700\n\nReply, paragraph 298 [Emphasis in original.], referring to Exhibit EL-178, United States Environmental Protection Agency Memorandum, *Considering Reasonably Anticipated Future Land Use and Reducing Barriers to Reuse at EPA-lead Superfund Remedial Sites*, p 2.\n\nReply, paragraph 299; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 70, line 4 to 72, line 15 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero); Ecuador cited in support Exhibits E-275, Confidential memorandum, ConocoPhillips, Huarani Reserve and Block 21 map, p 36, and E-273, Oilfield Sites and Sumaco Biosphere Reserve Map.\n\n280.\n\nFifth, IEMS defended its treatment of non-detect analytical results, criticising GSI for \"attempting to obfuscate IEMS' use of a conservative yet standard technique for handling non-detect data.\"701 It asserted that its method was \"a reasonable way to deal with the uncertainty of laboratory results when these results are reported at below the detection limit, but when field conditions are indicative of the presence of the contaminant of concern, at some level\", an approach that has been \"strongly recommend[ed]\" by the US EPA which has opined that \"non-detect samples [are] never [to] be considered to be zero or omitted from the data set (USEPA, 1989).\"702\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.4, p 49.\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.4, p 49, see also, p 50 (\"This is an extreme and unrealistic position on how to manage a censored dataset (that is, a dataset containing results that are either too high or too low to be quantified) and is not considered acceptable by most regulatory agencies (US EPA 2000, US EPA, 2002, US EPA 2007, Hesel, 2007)\").\n\n281.\n\nIn this regard, IEMS cited instances in which GSI itself had substituted non-detect or other results in its sampling. For example, it used a substitution of 50% of the detection limit for non-detects on samples for determining background values.703\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.4, p 50.\n\n282.\n\nSixth, IEMS responded to GSI's criticisms of its modeling technique using the ArcGIS software.704 It submitted that its choice and use of the IDW algorithm was sound.705 It characterised the parameters that it employed in its geo-mapping software as conservative.706 IEMS explained that its buffer was limited to a 10-meter radius around each sample,707 and in assessing whether one of the layers should be mapped it required at least 3 samples exhibiting contamination.708 If it contained less than 3 samples, \"these samples were not considered in the quantification model.\"709 It defended the use of the inverse distance weighted method of ArcGIS as \"appropriate and [...] generally accepted by the international scientific community.\"710 It challenged the modeling method adopted by GSI as unrealistically stopping at the position of the sample that establishes contamination if there are no additional samples further in that direction, ignoring the factual likelihood that there is further contamination in the area.711\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.5.\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.5.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraphs 170-174.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 171.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 172.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraph 172.\n\nReply, paragraph 195; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 173.\n\nReply, paragraph 196.\n\n283.\n\nIEMS contested each of the so-called \"key errors\" that GSI had identified, asserting they were \"falsely alleged.\"712 For example, the location and the extension of the bounds did not have a significant impact on the modeling, which is influenced in large part by the algorithm and the parameters inputted.713 In any event, \"[i]n light of the fact that there was no information about the environmental liabilities left by the operators of the oilfields prior to 2009, and that complete records of spills, mud pits, and other environmental incidents were not available, the evaluation of large bounds was a reasonable and prudent approach.\"714 Its main criticism of GSI's approach was that it assumed that the dispersion of contaminants was uniform and predictable715 when in fact it was \"radial and [\u2026] not influenced by the location of the samples.\"716 For this reason, IEMS used a variable search radius set to 12 samples but in an attempt to keep its results \"conservative\" applied a power value (i.e., the extent of the effect of a relatively higher concentration sample on the samples in its vicinity) of 3 which tended to decrease the size of the \"hot spot\" in the modeling: \"If the power is higher, the size of the hotspot will decrease, as the effect of the high concentration sample will be limited to the nearest cells.\"717 IEMS reasoned that a higher power took into account the topography of the area.718\n\nIEMS ER III, p 54\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.5.1, p 54.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 56.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 72: \"This is very far from reality.

Rejoinder, paragraphs 144-156.\n\n285.\n\nSeventh, IEMS asserted that GSI's treatment of the testing of groundwater and its results was contrary to Ecuadorian regulations and accepted scientific practice.724 It submitted that the applicable regulation was TULAS (Book VI, Annex 1, Section 4.1.3), *not* RAOHE (Annex 5), because the latter regulated water quality for superficial bodies and wastewater discharges, not groundwater.725 Annex 5 of RAOHE referred to filtration, but TULAS did not.726 In fact, TULAS mandates analysis of the total concentration of heavy metals, and is not restricted to the dissolved concentration: \"The difference between the two criteria is that the total concentration includes the dissolved, colloidal and suspended fractions of the contaminants within the sample, while the dissolved concentration does not include the colloidal and suspended fractions.\"727 For this reason and on the basis of standards promulgated by the Ecuadorian Standardization Institute (INEN 2169:98 and 276:98)728, IEMS submitted that GSI's method of filtering samples with 0.45 um filters (micrometers) was incorrect and invalidated its groundwater sampling conclusion.729 Moreover, it asserted that GSI did not measure the TPH in the groundwater, as required by TULAS, but instead chose to test three other different parameters: Gasoline Range Organics, Diesel Range Organics and Oil Range Organics and compared them individually to the criteria in TULAS.730 This compounded its error in filtering its samples.731\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.3.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 76; Reply, paragraph 166; RPS ER II, section 3.4, pp 22-23; IEMS ER III, section 3.3.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 75.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 75.

Its conclusion was that there was a \"very small difference between the filtered and unfiltered samples\", and in the instances that the concentration of contaminants did decrease between filtered and unfiltered samples from the same monitoring well, IEMS submitted that \"[t]his reduction could have been the result of dilution due to heavy rains happening during the days when the sampling process was performed.\"733\n\nIEMS ER III, p 77.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 79.\n\n287.\n\nEighth, on the matter of remediation, IEMS asserted that the experts were together on the issue of whether hydrocarbon-impacted soils should be sent off-site for treatment: GSI proposed that such soil be sent to an officially-approved soil remediation facility in the city of Coca for treatment while IEMS proposed that it is sent to an unspecified offsite bio-treatment facility.734 Where they diverged was on the treatment of soils contaminated by heavy metals; GSI proposed an on-site lined landfill, while IEMS proposed an off-site landfill.735\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.6.\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.6, p 73.\n\n288.\n\nIEMS asserted that since the operations in the Blocks are located in a sensitive ecosystem and \"given that it is expected that the oilfield areas will return to their original condition at the completion of petroleum operations, the presence of several landfills scattered throughout the Blocks containing contaminated material is not compatible with the future use of the areas.\"736 GSI's approach to estimating the unit costs of remediation were also said to be unrealistic, contrary to industry practice and ignored the \"specificities of the jungle environment\" in Blocks 7 and 21.737 For example, IEMS contended that \"GSI's figure of US$80/m3 is based on a very limited scope of work that [did] not take into account the challenges of performing these remediation works in the Amazon region and does not include the costs for excavation and crosscountry transportation.\"738 It also responded to GSI's criticism of its basis for the cost of remediating groundwater (i.e., using a US EPA survey of costs for groundwater remediation in the United States) by asserting that what GSI ignored was that \"local remediation providers in Ecuador do not have the necessary expertise to perform these remediation works\" and GSI itself did not put forward \"any alternative quantification based on local costs.\"739 IEMS' costs, in contrast, were said to be \"in line with common practice for these types of remediation projects in Ecuador as is confirmed by a recent economic price quotation from a local company (GPower).\"740\n\nIEMS ER III, p 73.\n\nReply, section 2.2.1.3; paragraphs 213-231.\n\nReply, paragraph 217.\n\nReply, paragraph 229; IEMS ER III, section 5.3.\n\nReply, paragraph 218.\n\n289.\n\nAccounting for corrected estimated contaminated soil volumes for Coca 8, Coca CPF, Payamino CPF/Payamino 1, Dayuno and Pad A, IEMS reported that its updated total estimated contaminated soil volumes was 1,867,835 m3 (background values case) and 691,444 m3 (regulatory reference criteria).741 It asserted its remediation cost estimate remained reasonable and that GSI's proposed cost estimate was based on the use of site landfills which was inappropriate for the Blocks and \"failed to account for the enormous difficulty (and significant cost) of working safely and protectively in the Amazon.\"742 Its revised estimated cost of remediation of contaminated soil was US$ 2,279,544.559 (background values) and US$ 831,125,954 (regulatory reference criteria).743 It maintained the same estimate cost of groundwater remediation as in its second report.744\n\nIEMS ER III, p 112; IEMS in its third report conceded there was a typographical error in its excel spreadsheet setting out the cost-proposal for remediation, explaining that it used a 30% mark-up for implementation of safety measures when this should have been 3%, resulting in an overestimation of around US $110,000,000 (Reply, paragraph 221; IEMS ER III, section 5.5).\n\nIEMS ER III, pp 113-125.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 123.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 112.\n\n290.\n\nAs noted above, IEMS' third expert report was submitted together with an expert report from RPS which reviewed and responded specifically to GSI's first report.745 RPS submitted that significant flaws in GSI's site investigation method \"fundamentally undermine[d] the resulting conclusions reached by GSI on the environmental conditions in the CPUF, Block 7 and Block 21 and the risk they pose to human health.\"746 RPS opined that there were significant flaws in GSI's testing and sampling methodology, in the choice and application of regulatory criteria, and in the modeling that GSI adopted.747\n\nReply, paragraphs 181-186; RPS ER III, paragraphs 1.1-1.3. RPS was engaged by Ecuador to \"provid[e] a further independent assessment of \u2018 *the environmental investigation conducted by GSI, the risk assessment GSI purports to perform, and the conclusions GSI reached based on their activities'*.\" (RPS ER III, Section 1.3, p 3 [Italics in original]).\n\nRPS ER III, section 2, p 5; Reply, paragraph 174.\n\nReply, section 2.1.\n\n291.\n\nThe first such flaw was that GSI's investigation was deliberately narrow in scope, in that GSI conducted inspections at only 58 of the 74 sites investigated by IEMS, and collected samples from a \"mere 24 of the 74 sites studied by IEMS (85% of them being collected from only 18 sites)\" for soil contamination testing.748 In the case of alleged groundwater contamination, GSI similarly collected samples at only 15 out of the 18 sites identified.749 This was because GSI restricted itself to investigating only reports of soil contamination that surpassed regulatory or risk-based thresholds (i.e., it did not investigate reports of soil contamination above base values but below regulatory or risk-based limits).750 Even so, there were five sites where IEMS had reported the presence of contamination above the regulatory criteria employed by GSI which the latter ignored without explanation; \"GSI also ignored other sites for which IEMS had collected soil samples showing environmental impacts within platform areas, even though platforms are not exempted from remediation for environmental damage.\"751\n\nReply, paragraphs 68-69; RPS ER III, section 3.1, pp 10-13.\n\nReply, paragraph 69; RPS ER III, section 3.1, pp 10-13.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 2-5.\n\nReply, paragraph 70, referring to GSI ER 1, paragraph 7; relying on RPS ER III, section 3.1.\n\n292.\n\nSecond, the selective use of \"indicator parameters\" invalidated GSI's approach to the investigation of the Blocks.752 It resulted in their excluding sites in the face of clear evidence of possible contamination. RPS cited the example of an area near Payamino 1 that GSI had identified as exhibiting \"oil residue associated with a former produced water surface impoundment\" but which it then excluded on the basis that samples from the site did not indicate impacts based on electrical conductance.753 GSI's approach also resulted in its excluding all heavy metal contamination found in Blocks 7 and 21; in RPS's view, this was an \"absurd consequence [that] render[ed] the Ecuadorian regulations that provide[d] for acceptable limits of certain heavy metals wholly pointless.\"754 Finally, RPS submitted that this approach was inconsistent with the Consortium's own practice, referring to an Environmental Protection Guide that Perenco had developed while it operated the Blocks which identified 16 chemical substances that should be monitored and did not condition them on whether they were associated with hydrocarbon, barium or any other indicator substance.755\n\nRSP ER III, section 3.2; Reply, section 2.1.2.2.\n\nReply, paragraph 74; RPS ER III, section 3.2.\n\nReply, paragraph 76; RPS ER III, section 3.2.\n\nReply, paragraph 77.\n\n293.\n\nThird, RPS responded to GSI's criticism of IEMS' calculation of background values, contending that GSI had misrepresented IEMS' approach and had ignored applicable Ecuadorian regulations. Recalling that IEMS had arrived at Base Values by calculating the *mean* concentration of \u2018clean samples' and GSI had countered that the appropriate methodology should be the *upper range* of concentrations exhibited, Ecuador submitted that GSI's approach was \"not consistent with Ecuadorian regulations\" and \"neither GSI nor [Perenco] [were] capable of pointing to a single legal authority for calculating Base Values\" in this manner.756 In contrast, IEMS' approach was validated by TULAS which specified that Base Values should be determined as the \"mean\" concentration.757 TULAS further specified that the maximum permissible limits were defined by multiplying the mean concentration obtained by three, but that this was not the standard applicable to remediation which TULAS stipulated was back to 1.5 times the Base Value.758\n\nReply, section 2.1.3.1; RPS ER III, paragraph 92.\n\nReply, paragraph 87; referring to Exhibit EL-146, TULAS, Article 4.1.3.3.\n\nReply, paragraphs 87; referring to Exhibit EL-14, TULAS, Article 4.1.3.3.\n\n294.\n\nEcuador asserted that, in any event, GSI misrepresented the results of IEMS' calculation of Base Values using the mean of clean samples when it alleged that this resulted in 80% of the clean samples to be deemed contaminated.759 GSI assumed that IEMS had concluded a sample was contaminated if a single element exceeded Base Values, but IEMS' approach was in fact to examine the eight criteria identified in RAOHE and TULAS (TPH, barium, cadmium, nickel, lead, vanadium, electrical conductivity and pH) before making such determination.760\n\nReply, paragraph 88.\n\nReply, paragraph 88; IEMS ER III, section 3.2.1.2.\n\n295.\n\nFourth, GSI was alleged to have failed to properly test for groundwater contamination in the Blocks, by employing the wrong sampling technique and discarding samples which exhibited contamination by classifying them as \"false positives.\"761 RPS responded to GSI's submission that Annex 5 of RAOHE required IEMS to apply proper filtration methods in its groundwater sampling.762 RAOHE, however, \"d[id] not apply to groundwater, but only to surface water and wastewater\", and the regulation that governed groundwater sampling was instead TULAS, which did not require the filtration of groundwater samples.763\n\nReply, paragraphs 164-170; IEMS ER III, Section 3.3; RPS ER I, section 3.4 cf.

[...] The BLRA is a step-wise process to characterize the current and potential threats to human health and the environment that may be posed by contaminants in environmental media. Although GSI has stated that they \u2018applied the Risk-Based Corrective Action (RBCA) framework' in their risk assessment, significant elements from RBCA and BLRA were missing or improperly applied, resulting in a superficial evaluation of risk to human health and no evaluation of the environmental risk that is posed by the CPUF, Block 7, and Block 21 sites [...]779\n\nReply, paragraph 179.\n\nRPS ER III, section 2, pp 6-9; section 4, pp 27-74; IEMS ER III, section 3.4.\n\n**G. Second expert report of GSI and Dr. Rouhani's analysis of IEMS' modelling**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n302.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Perenco filed a second expert report by GSI together with a report prepared by an expert on geostatistics and spatial modeling, Dr. Shahrokh Rouhani, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and CEO of NewFields Companies, LLC. Dr. Rouhani analysed IEMS' use of ArcGIS modeling as compared to GSI's delineation method and concluded that IEMS' modeling \"suffer[ed] from a number of fundamental deficiencies\" that rendered its results statistically unreliable and liable to contradiction by actual soil sampling results.780 GSI's delineation approach was, in contrast, conducted \"in an effective manner\" and passed a reliability test using probability plot analyses.781\n\nRouhani ER, paragraphs 99-100.\n\nRouhani ER, paragraphs 99-100. The Respondent sought for and was granted leave to file a response to Dr. Rouhani's evidence (see Procedural Order No. 8 dated 2 September 2013). It did so in the form of a Supplemental Expert Report from IEMS (IEMS ER IV).\n\n303.\n\nDr. Rouhani concluded that setting aside the errors and assumptions that IEMS had inputted into the ArcGIS software and the latter's failure to use the tools available within the software to confirm the validity and reliability of its model,782 the critical flaw in IEMS' analysis is that it chose an \"inverse distance weighting\" (IDW) interpolation approach from a number of the approaches available in the ArcGIS software rather than a site-specific field delineation approach.783 The IDW interpolation approach, in his view, was not an appropriate method for modeling soil contamination because \"it cannot make predictions within any acceptable range of reliability.\"784\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 186-198; Dr. Rouhani testified that validating testing was a necessary element of any modeling exercise of this sort, and had IEMS undertaken this it would have discovered that its model was unacceptably inaccurate (Rouhani ER, paragraphs 38-39); cf. IEMS ER III, p 66 (cross-validation exercise by IEMS of Coca 8); Rejoinder, paragraph 92 and Rouhani ER, paragraphs 19, 26-28, 30-33, 50, 55, 61, 65, 69, Table A.1 (Dr. Rouhani explained that IEMS should have tested for data correlation using the variogram method which demonstrates whether the data relate to each other across an area of space.).\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 157-174, 176-; Rouhani ER, paragraphs 50, 69, 88, 98, 100; IEMS ER II, Annex A.8 (to show there are a number of methods available in the ArcGIS software).\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 157-185.\n\n304.\n\nDr. Rouhani opined that the methodology that GSI employed, known as \"handcontouring\" and premised on delineation from actual data points, was the comparatively more reliable method for measuring the extent of contamination in a given area.785 To reiterate GSI's approach, this involved \"sampling known or suspected areas of contamination and then \u2018delineating' these areas by taking additional samples until clean soil is reached\" and working with the topographical features to create the contours of the contaminated area.786 This led Perenco to submit that \"GSI's delineation results have not only been confirmed by GSI's latest field visit and sampling campaign, but were also verified by IEMS' additional testing at 22 sites in December 2012.\"787\n\nRouhani ER, paragraphs 88, 98, 100; Rejoinder, paragraphs 163-164.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 163; 2nd Expert Report of GSI dated 2 July 2013 (\"GSI ER II\"), paragraph 49(c); Rouhani ER, paragraph 88, 100.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 171.\n\n305.\n\nFor its part, GSI defended its use of indicator parameters as \"entirely rational\" and based on scientific practice.788 The parameters (i.e., TPH, barium and electrical conductivity) had been selected by GSI on the basis of a sampling of crude, produced water and drilling muds from the Blocks.789 GSI \"properly concluded that exceedances of \u2018non-indicator' analytes were not related to releases from oil operations unless they were found in combination with the \u2018indicator' of TPH or barium.\"790 In any event, Perenco submitted that the use of indicator parameters concerned at most 39 off-platform soil samples - \"1% of the approximately 3,500 soil samples taken in the Blocks - because only those 39 samples [were] located outside of GSI's remediation areas and show[ed] an exceedance of non-indicator analytes without an accompanying presence of TPH or barium.\"791\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 141-143.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 141.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 142.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 143.\n\n306.\n\nGSI also reiterated its criticism of the use of background values. Recalling that Ecuador, IEMS and RPS contended that Article 4.1.3.3 of TULAS mandated this approach,792 it asserted that this was contradictory since the premise of Ecuador's background values case was the claimed inability to rely on its existing regulatory parameters and it ignored the fact that Article 4.1.3.3 of TULAS was triggered only in the event of \"the inapplicability of any parameter established in the present regulation in a specific case or the absence in the regulation of a parameter relevant to the soil under study\".793 For example, the TULAS parameters cannot be used if the naturally-occurring levels are higher than the TULAS limits.794 This is consistent with RAOHE Table 6 which provides that \"[i]f the natural (non-contaminated) soils in the area present concentrations higher than the established limits, the values of the respective parameter may be increased to this level.\"795\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 86; IEMS ER III, pp 18; RPS ER III, pp 18-19; c.f.

IEMS' response to Dr. Rouhani's analysis**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe Respondent sought and was granted leave to file a response to Dr. Rouhani's expert evidence filed with the Rejoinder and did so in the form of a Supplemental Expert Report from IEMS dated 4 September 2013.809 IEMS described Dr. Rouhani's conclusions as \"misleading\" and flawed, and failing to \"address the overall approach that [IEMS] took in estimating the level of contamination at Blocks 7 and 21.\"810 It characterised its model as \"not designed to predict exact concentrations as the final outcome, but rather whether concentrations were likely to be in the range requiring remediation.\"811 In contrast, Dr. Rouhani's critique was premised on taking \"each estimated data *point* \" and assessing its statistical reliability in depicting the precise level of contamination that actually existed at that point.812\n\nProcedural Order No. 8 dated 2 September 2013. The Respondent sought leave to respond to Dr. Rouhani's report and the witness statement of Mr. Gilberto Mart\u00ednez.\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 1.\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 1.\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 1 [Emphasis in original.].\n\n311.\n\nIEMS further contended that Dr. Rouhani's analysis proceeded on the assumption that the ArcGIS variogram tools were \"adequate to review data sets that were not designed for use with variograms and were not compiled on an incremental basis using the variogram (and kriging) techniques in mind.\"813 It added that IEMS had chosen the IDW interpolation technique precisely because it \"[did] not require or anticipate the use of variograms and kriging.\"814 Moreover, the variogram and kriging methods used in Dr. Rouhani's analysis were \"modeled using an algorithm for uniform characteristics\" and in this way were unsuited to the anisotropic character of the contamination that presented in the Blocks. In this connection, in contrast to Dr. Rouhani's criticism that the IDW method that IEMS employed failed to take into account the topography and other site specific characteristics, Annexes A.1, A.3 and A.12 of IEMS' April 2012 report showed that in designing its sampling program IEMS exhaustively studied and took \"full account of the physical and geographic features of each site.\"815 IEMS submitted that its investigations confirmed that the contamination at each site was \"generally of an anisotopic nature (the contamination was \u2018directional' rather than uniform and equally distributed in all directions)\" and that the IDW method \"performs better to represent contamination of differential and directional characteristics.\"816\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 3.\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 3.\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 2.\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 3.\n\n312.\n\nIn any event, IEMS submitted that when it repeated the ArcGIS modeling exercise using the data it collected in December 2012 within the bounds of 15 sites it had inspected for the purpose of its 2013 report,817 the results demonstrated that its modeling was reliable although it revealed they \"had underestimated the volumes to be remediated under background values in Blocks 7 and 21 by 8.29% (and overestimated volumes to be remediated under regulatory criteria by 7%).\"818 This translated to an increase of nearly US$ 320 million in Ecuador's \u2018background values' case.\n\nThese are Coca 1, Coca 8, Coca 9, Coca 12, Coca 18 & 19, Payamino CPF, Payamino 4, Payamino 16, Payamino 21, Payamino 23, Gacela 4, Gacela 6 & 9, Mono 10 & 12, Jaguar 3, and Jaguar 7 & 8.

Contemporaneous Evidence Noted by the Experts and the Parties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in addition to the expert reports filed by both Parties, there is contemporaneous evidence pertaining to the Blocks' conditions during the Consortium's operatorship and at and around the time of the takeover in July 2009 which was submitted by each party.\n\n314.\n\nPerenco submitted that studies and audits of Blocks 7 and 21 conducted \"before and after July 2009 show that the Blocks were in exemplary condition.\"819 It relied, amongst other things, on the biannual audit conducted in 2002 in Block 21820 which found that Perenco's operations conformed \"with environmental legislation\"821, the biannual audits conducted in 2008, which in its submission, revealed that, in Block 7, \"soil samples taken in 13 locations revealed exceedance of regulatory standards in the Payamino Sanitary Landfill... [but all] other samples were compliant\"822, and in Block 21, \"did not identify a single major non-conformity\",823 and finally, the six *ex post* environmental impact studies commissioned by Petroamazonas and reported in July 2010, which identified only a selected number of major non-conformities and did not identify any groundwater contamination.824\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 173-179, 341-366; Rejoinder, paragraph 17.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-137, Letter of March 23, 2002 from Efficacitas to Perenco, attaching 2002 Environmental Audit of Block 21, pp 73-78.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-137, Letter of March 23, 2002 from Efficacitas to Perenco, attaching 2002 Environmental Audit of Block 21, pp 10-11 (\"Due to the fact that development activities are not yet taking place in the zone, samples were taken from outside the grease traps, which would be the most likely places to be contaminated.

Perenco also relied on *ex post* environmental impact studies of the Blocks performed by Petroecuador after July 2009 which it submitted were \"consistent with the [2008] audits and noted only very limited environmental non-compliances.\" (Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 179, referring to Exhibits CE-CC-244, Ex-post Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Yuralpa Complex, Block 21, July 2010, section 3, pp 287-288; CE-CC-241, Ex-post Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Coca Complex, Block 7, June 2010; CE-CC-242, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Mono Complex, Block 7, June 2010 ; CE-CC-236, Programming and maintenance services contract between Proyectos Integrales del Ecuador (PIL) and Petroamazonas, June 3, 2010; CE-CC-243, Ex-post Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Waponi-Ocatoe Complex, Block 21, July 2010.\n\n*Ibid.* ; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 362-366; Rejoinder, paragraph 68.\n\n315.\n\nEcuador attacked the credibility of the audits commissioned by Perenco, relying on IEMS' evidence825 and on the technical report issued by the Ministry in August 2009 (noted above). To reiterate, the technical report recorded the Ministry's recommendation that Perenco should be sanctioned and made to cure defects in its 2008 audits because the Ministry's team had identified major non-compliances with Ecuadorian environmental regulations.826 Ecuador contended that the State had not, and it in fact could not have, approved the results of the 2008 audits.827 Ecuador also pointed out that such audits were supposed to be conducted every two years and Perenco had failed to comply with its obligation to conduct the audits in 2004 (with a resulting gap in audits from 2002 to 2006).828\n\nIEMS ER II, Annex P, p 1; see also, Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 110 and 114.\n\nExhibit E-176, Technical Inspection Report.\n\nSupplemental Memorial, paragraphs 108, 115-122; referring to Exhibit E-176, Technical Inspection Report.\n\nRPS ER I, section 6; Reply, paragraph 37.\n\n316.\n\nPerenco's response was that the non-conformities identified by the Ministry resulted either from Ecuador's mismanagement of the Blocks after the Consortium left the Blocks, or else were very minor.829 It contended further that regardless of whether Ecuador ultimately approved of the results of the earlier 2008 audits, it had \"approved the proposed scope of the audits before they were performed, approved the auditing firm that carried them out, sent its *own engineers* to supervise the audit, and largely approved in substance the results of a verification of the audits.\"830 The \u2018approval in substance' referred to the same inspection by the Ministry in August 2009.831 Similarly, Perenco responded to IEMS' offering an opinion in this regard by stating it was \"unclear how IEMS could possibly make such a determination, or how Ecuador could comfortably rely on it, given that the 2008 audits were based on terms of reference that the Ministry had itself approved.\"832 In its view, it was significant that this inspection and the 2012 Environmental Impact Studies commissioned by Petroamazonas similarly found limited environmental non-compliances.833\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 177.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 351-355 [Claimant's emphasis]; Rejoinder, paragraphs 67-69.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 356, referring to Exhibit E-176, Technical Inspection Report.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 178, referring to Exhibit CE-CC-172, Letter of August 11, 2008 from DINAPA to the Consortium.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 67-69.\n\n**IV. FINDINGS**\n----------------\n\n**A. The Tribunal's Approach to the Counterclaim as it Currently Stands**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nHaving reviewed the Parties' written submissions, expert reports and the oral testimony and submissions of counsel at the hearing, and after extensive deliberation, the Tribunal has arrived at a number of conclusions as to the manner in which the counterclaim was put and the state of evidence after the written and oral phase of the current proceeding was completed. These conclusions will be set out over the course of this Findings section of the Decision.\n\n318.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal will make certain findings of fact and law which shall be applied to ascertain the extent of damage for which Perenco will be held liable. Such findings can be grouped under two sets of questions: (i) what can be called the major questions of law and fact, the resolution of which will narrow the claim's analysis; and (ii) certain subsidiary issues concerning the interpretation of RAOHE, TULAS and the Environmental Management Law. During the course of its analysis, the Tribunal will also decide on the reliability of the mapping exercise employed by IEMS.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Findings on the Legal Framework Governing the Dispute**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Constitution and the Applicable Regulatory Regime**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nThe first and foremost legal question presented to the Tribunal concerns the impact of the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution on the legal framework governing the Tribunal's consideration of the counterclaim. The Constitution's objective of full restoration and the protection of nature itself as a subject of environmental rights, its rule on the imprescriptibility of environmental torts, its potential impact on the burden of proof and causation issues (i.e., through its creation of a strict liability regime) and the Constitution's temporal application has given rise to a number of issues that have divided the Parties.\n\n320.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the two most important issues in this regard are: (i) the relationship between the Constitution's emphasis on full restoration, on the one hand, and the environmental impact that oilfield operations are permitted to have under RAOHE and TULAS, on the other; and (ii) whether the Constitution's establishment of a strict liability regime can be applied to all of Perenco's activities, given that most of them (i.e., until 20 October 2008) took place when the 1998 Constitution was in effect.\n\n**(2) The Relationship Between the Constitution and the Hydrocarbons Environmental Regulations**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nAfter carefully considering the arguments and the evidence, the Tribunal does not accept Ecuador's arguments that its hydrocarbons regulatory regime does not sufficiently protect the environment and therefore should give way to the \"background values\" or \"base values\" methodology employed by IEMS as its primary means of evaluating the Blocks.834 The Tribunal found Ecuador's (and IEMS') arguments on this point to be counter-intuitive and after due consideration finds that it must apply the detailed statutory and regulatory provisions of Ecuadorian law rather than use a \"background values\" approach.835 The Ecuadorian system might perhaps not be as rigorous as Perenco has sought to portray it, but it is, to the Tribunal, a considered regulatory regime that has been developed by Ecuador over the years and it has been administered in a generally consistent manner by regulators and operators alike.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Ecuador referred to IEMS' analysis of the regime and asserted: \"IEMS explains that the Ecuadorian regulatory criteria, when compared to the Base Values for Blocks 7 and 21, do not provide for full remediation of the contamination and, therefore, do not fully protect the environment or the health of the population. Thus, according to IEMS, a proper environmental audit must not stop at the regulatory thresholds, but must evaluate the level of contaminants in comparison with the [b]ase [v]alues. This is what IEMS did in its Expert Report.\" [Footnote omitted.] (Ecuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 797-799); see also, IEMS ER I, p 19.\n\nIEMS' witness, Mr. Alfaro, observed that their \"own initial instinct was to apply the regulatory limits.\" Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, pp 1081-1082 (Testimony of IEMS).\n\n322.\n\nThe Tribunal can well appreciate the novelty of certain legal questions presented in this counterclaim when the generally worded prescriptions of Ecuador's highest law are considered. It can also appreciate the basic logic of the \"background values\" thesis employed by IEMS, given the Constitution's focus on full restoration. There is no doubt that the Constitution attaches great importance to the protection of the environment and to the restoration of environmentally disturbed ecosystems. As shall be seen, the Tribunal considers that the Constitution's focus on environmental protection means that when choosing between certain disputed (but reasonable) interpretations of the Ecuadorian regulatory regime, the interpretation which most favours the protection of the environment is to be preferred.\n\n323.\n\nHaving carefully considered the Parties' submissions and the expert reports, however, the Tribunal considers that although the 2008 Constitution contains important provisions dealing with the protection of the environment and has effect as a set of foundational legal rules, it does not purport to prescribe the environmental regulatory regime governing hydrocarbon operations. Rather, the specific rules governing the environmental aspects of hydrocarbon exploitation are to be found within RAOHE, TULAS, and the Environmental Management Law, all of which preceded the 2008 Constitution's making but which have continued to remain in force since its entry into force.836\n\nAs Perenco noted in its Post-Hearing Submission, at paragraph 10, guidelines issued jointly by the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Non-Renewable Resources after the Constitution's promulgation (as to which Professor Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n was not cross-examined) stated that: \"in the event that... any event (accident) occurs or is detected where, regarding key components of the social and natural environment, *the reported parameters are outside of the permissible limits established by the environmental norms in force*, the contingency plan shall be put into place, and *the damage to the environmental and social components shall then be characterised and evaluated*.\" [Emphasis added.]; Exhibit CA-CC-55, p 4.\n\n324.\n\nHad the 2008 Constitution effected a significant alteration of the normative regime in which the State's environmental regulations were to be made and applied, the Tribunal believes that Congress and the Executive would have enacted new laws and/or promulgated new regulations in order to implement the new environmental edicts. Yet this has not been done. No evidence was given to the Tribunal to show that after the 2008 Constitution's entry into force the Congress or the Executive decided to replace RAOHE, TULAS and the Environmental Management Law with more stringent rules. To the contrary, all have continued in force since 2008 and have been applied in a more or less consistent fashion by the responsible authorities *vis-\u00e0-vis* Blocks 7 and 21 and, as far as the evidence shows, to other oilfields as well.\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with the relationship between the Environmental Management Law with RAOHE and TULAS, and the thrust of TULAS itself, which supports the view that, even though those instruments preceded the Constitution's making, they continue to provide regulatory limits for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination that are consistent with the Constitution's environmental precepts.\n\n326.\n\nIn defending the use of \"background values\", the Respondent and its legal expert, Professor Andrade, referred to the definition of the term \"environmental harm\" in the Environmental Management Law. The Tribunal recalls that the Law refers to \"[a]ny significant loss, diminution, detriment or impairment of the preexisting conditions in the environment or one of its components. It affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its resources.\"837 Ecuador contended that the definition provided the notion of \"repairable environmental harm\" which was consistent with the constitutional imperative to remedy any and all environmental harm (i.e., \"full restoration\").838 It submitted further that RAOHE and TULAS are confined to setting the thresholds within which hydrocarbon activities could be undertaken in a lawful fashion and in that connection, when administrative sanctions could be imposed on operators for illicit hydrocarbon activities, but they did not purport to define the notion of *repairable* harm.839\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, p 18 of PDF. The Parties do not disagree on the English translation of these definitions: see Reply, paragraph 246 and Rejoinder, paragraphs 37-38.\n\nReply, paragraphs 6 and 246; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 59-60 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n327.\n\nThis, in the Tribunal's view, did not fully reflect the situation. The Environmental Management Law preceded RAOHE by two years, and TULAS by four years.840 It refers to sustainable development in its first chapter and its objective of establishing the \"principles and guidelines\" of environmental policy and management in Ecuador in Article 1.841 In its glossary of definitions, in addition to defining \"Environmental Harm\" as noted above, the Law provides definitions for the terms \"Contamination\" and \"Environmental Impact\". \"Contamination\" refers to \"concentrations... *superior or inferior to those established in the legislation in force\"842* \"Environment Harm\" refers not just to \u2018any loss, diminution, detriment or impairment\" but \"[a]ny *significant* loss, diminution, detriment or impairment. \".843 The Law thus contemplates degrees of disturbance ascertainable by reference to law, not the equation of \"environmental impact\" with \"environmental harm\". Ecuador has not demonstrated how RAOHE and TULAS interacted with these provisions of the Environmental Management Law in any way other than in their logical role as more detailed regulations governing all or virtually all environmental issues that can arise out of hydrocarbons exploitation in furtherance of the Environmental Management Law's general framework.\n\nThe Environmental Management Law (*Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental*) was first enacted on 30 July 1999; see Exhibits CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, Chapter 1; CE-CC-269, Chronology of Ecuador's Environmental Laws and 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 15. The document on record in this arbitration is Exhibit CA-CC-33/Annex 12 to 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza. It is dated as having been published in Official Gazette No. 418 on 10 September 2004 and is titled Codification of the Environmental Management Act (term used by Professor Ricardo Crespo Plaza in footnote 23 of his 1st Expert Report). RAOHE was published in the Official Register on 13 February 2001 (EL-147), TULAS was published in the Official Register on 21 March 2003 (EL-146).\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, p 17 of PDF.\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, p 18 of PDF [Emphasis added.].\n\nExhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, p 18 of PDF [Emphasis added.].\n\n328.\n\nRAOHE and TULAS articulate in detail the \"parameters, maximum reference values and permissible limits\" that operators are required to observe when complying with their environmental obligations.844 RAOHE, in particular, as the instrument of more specific application to hydrocarbon activities, provides expressly in its Article 86 that, as regards their operations, operators are required to comply with the permissible limits set forth in its Annexes, such as in Table 6, entitled, \"identification and remediation of contaminated soils in all phases of the hydrocarbons industry.\"845\n\nPhrase taken from title of RAOHE, Annex II (Exhibit EL-147, RAOHE) (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\nIntroductory paragraph of RAOHE, Article 86 (Exhibit EL-147, RAOHE) (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013)\n\n329.\n\nTULAS likewise recognises the distinction between environmental impact and environmental harm, and in this way it accepts that Ecuadorian environmental law gives meaning and effect to the principle of sustainable development by accepting that the development of the Nation's physical resources will inevitably have an environmental impact and therefore a balance must be struck between what is an acceptable anthropogenic disturbance of the natural environment and what is unacceptable environmental damage triggering the obligation to remediate.\n\n330.\n\nThe distinction is discernable in Tables 2 and 3 in Annex 2 of TULAS. Table 2 (\"Soil Quality Standards\"), establishes non site-specific standards for the background values of 36 different elements that may be present in soil. Its values are lower than those set out in Table 3, entitled (significantly, in the Tribunal's view), \"Criteria for Remediation and Restoration of Soils\", which provides site-specific standards (four different types of land use) that establish the \"maximum levels of concentration of contaminants in soil under remediation or restoration.\"846 This is further bolstered by the definition proffered by TULAS of the term \"Baseline (background)\" which: \"Denotes the prevailing environmental conditions, prior to any disturbance. *That is to say, it signifies the conditions that would have predominated in the absence of anthropogenic activities*.\".847 The Respondent relies on TULAS to support its \"background values\" approach and to provide, in the form of Table 2, its alternative regulatory criteria for the remediation of soil.848 The framework within TULAS, however, suggests that this is not exactly what it provides. The Tribunal will revert to this below.\n\nSee above at paragraph 101; see also, Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 280; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 166.\n\nExhibit EL-146, TULAS [Emphasis added.] (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013). In the Claimant's proferred translation of Article 2.38 of Annex 2, Volume VI (Criteria for Contaminated Soil Remediation), the relevant parts are: \"prevailing environmental conditions prior to any disturbance.i.e, conditions that would have prevailed in the absence of anthropogenic activities, and as a consequence of natural processes only.\" (Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 253, footnote 306). See above at paragraphs 103-105.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 280; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 166.\n\n331.\n\nMoreover, RAOHE and TULAS are consistent with the supreme law's embrace of the principle of sustainable development.849 On this the experts agreed; in tracing the development of environmental laws in Ecuador from the 1970s and the influence of the Rio Declaration in 1992, they indicated that \u2018sustainable development' informed the precepts of the Environmental Management Law, RAOHE, TULAS and other Ecuadorian regulatory instruments.850 The Tribunal considers that this is relevant to the distinction drawn by the Environmental Management Law between the definitions of \"environmental harm\" and \"environmental impact.\" The Tribunal will return to this when examining RAOHE's and TULAS's role in the regulation of hydrocarbon operations.\n\nExhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, pp 122-123 of PDF (quoting from Article 396), Article 3 of the Environmental Management Law (Exhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, pp 16-17); 1st Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza, paragraph 16; 1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, paragraph 32.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Professor Crespo conceded that even after the 2008 Constitution, \"the way that remediation is carried out under RAOHE is by applying the permissible limits\" and this was consistent with Nature's right to full restoration under the Constitution: see Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, pp 922924 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza).\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that Ecuador and its state-owned entity, Petroamazonas, have over the years consistently treated RAOHE and TULAS as providing the regulatory limits applicable to the evaluation of the environmental condition of lands on which hydrocarbon operations have been permitted to take place. It was also RAOHE, and not background values, that was identified in the terms of reference proposed by Kerr-McGee to be used as the basis for its audits of Blocks 7 and 21 during its operatorship and, as required by Ecuadorian law, this was subject to the review and approval of Ecuadorian authorities.851 This carried over to the 2002 biennial audits provided to DINAPA around the time that the operatorship was transferred from Kerr-McGee to Perenco (in December 2002).852 RAOHE and TULAS were also applied consistently by the authorities (in some instances on their own initiative rather than at the operator's prompting) in environmental audits and remediation proposals resulting from hydrocarbon operations.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Article 42.\n\nSee, for e.g., Exhibit E-266, *Aud\u00edtoria Ambiental Bloque 7 - 2002, Perenco Ecuador Limited,* December 2002, p. 59. (Spanish original: \" *Los niveles y concentraciones de los par\u00e1metros medidos son menores a los l\u00edmites permisibles enunciados en la tabla 4A del RAOH 1215* \"), Table 4-16, p 132.\n\n333.\n\nThere are numerous examples on the record, but the Tribunal has chosen a few to illustrate the point. For example, in September 2007, the National Environmental Protection Directorate (DINAPA) dismissed a complaint filed by the Orellana Human Rights Permanent Committee related to the operation of the Punino 1 well.853 Its explanation to the Committee was that Perenco had provided DINAPA with physico-chemical analyses of samples it had taken during an inspection of the area, and the \"values obtained compl[ied] with the permissible limits established in Tables 4a, 4b and 6 of [RAOHE], which show[ed] that *there is no contamination as a result of the hydrocarbons activities* that are carried out on the mentioned platform.\"854\n\nExhibit CE-CC-328, Letter from DINAPA to Orellana regarding alleged contamination at Punino 1, September 14, 2007, PER\\_CC0011693.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-328, Letter from DINAPA to Orellana regarding alleged contamination at Punino 1, September 14, 2007, PER\\_CC0011693 [Emphasis added.].\n\n334.\n\nThis approach continued while the Constitution was being finalised during the course of 2008. In January 2008, for example, the Consortium presented to the National Director for Environmental Protection and the Minister of Mines and Petroleum laboratory results of samples taken from an area where a remediation programme had been carried out for a crude-oil spill that occurred on 26 May 2007 from the flow line of the Oso 2 well.855 The sampling results were evaluated pursuant to Table 6 of Annex 2 of RAOHE and this was accepted, without objection, by the Ministry.856\n\nExhibit CE-CC-152, Letter of January 11, 2008 from the Consortium to DINAPA, PER\\_CC0005054.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-152, Letter of January 11, 2008 from the Consortium to DINAPA, PER\\_CC0005055; see Exhibit CE-CC-138, Letter of August 14, 2007 from Ministry of Mines and Petroleum to the Consortium, PER\\_CC0004697.\n\n335.\n\nIn another instance, following a complaint in February 2008 from landowners in the Parish of Nuevo Paraiso regarding contamination said to have resulted from the operation of the Coca 7, 11, 12, 13 and 15 wells, Ecuador's Undersecretary for Environmental Protection ordered a technical environmental inspection to be carried out in coordination with the Regional Delegate of Environmental Protection of the Amazon.857 This included the physico-chemical analysis of water and soil samples. On 25 June 2008, the Undersecretary informed the complainants that the results obtained \"compl[ied] with the allowable limits established in Tables 4a, 4b and 6 of Annex 2 of [RAOHE]\", demonstrating \"that *there is no evidence of contamination* from hydrocarbons due to activities carried out by [Perenco] on the Platform of wells Coca 7, 11, 12, 13 and 15.\"858\n\nExhibit CE-CC-333, Letter from DINAPA to Perenco regarding complaint from Sr. Dorado with respect to Coca wells, June 25, 2008, PER\\_CC0011721.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-333, Letter from DINAPA to Perenco regarding complaint from Sr. Dorado with respect to Coca wells, PER\\_CC0011722 [Emphasis added].\n\n336.\n\nOn 28 August 2008, the Undersecretary for Environmental Protection wrote to Perenco's General Manager regarding an environmental remediation programme that the company was carrying out in the Province of Orellana stemming from a cut in the Gacela Payamino gas pipeline on 6 October 2007.859 A representative of the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum was sent to investigate whether the remediation programme was carried out effectively, and this was performed under the supervision of Ecuador's Regional Department of Environmental Protection for the Amazon-Orellana province on 5 May 2008. The inspection concluded that the physicochemical analysis of water and soil samples submitted by Perenco in June 2008 \" *compl[ied] with the allowable limits established in Tables 4a, 4b and 6 of the Annex* to [RAOHE].\"860 It ordered the original complaint to be archived since it considered that the remediation was properly done.861\n\nExhibit CE-CC-335, Letter from DINAPA to Perenco regarding complaint of Sra.

Tapuy with respect to Gacela field, August 28, 2008, PER\\_CC0011757 [Emphasis added.].\n\nOther examples before the 2008 Constitution entered into force: *Petroproducci\u00f3n* 's remediation of Cuyabeno 8 in 2007 (Exhibit CE-CC-139, Letter of September 10, 2007 from Petroproducci\u00f3n to DINAPA, attaching the Report on the Treatment of Materials Contaminated with Hydrocarbons as a Result of the Cuyabeno 8 Spill PER\\_CC0004722), and ENAP Sipec's remediation of Biguno 1 in 2007 (Exhibit CE-CC-144, Letter of October 31, 2007 from ENAP SIPEC to DINAPA, attaching Remediation Plan for the Spill in the Flow Line in the Y-Denominated Sector of the Malanga (Biguno 1), PER\\_CC0004883 (\"none of the parameters after removal exceed the Maximum Permissible Limit established in Table 6 of Appendix 2 of [RAOHE] for agricultural use\".).\n\n337.\n\nIn essence, the Undersecretary's determinations mirrored Perenco's submissions in the present case that oilfield activities that result in the emission of certain controlled substances that disturb background values but do not exceed the permitted levels stipulated by RAOHE or TULAS, as the case may be, do not create an environmental harm of such significance as to require remediation. That is, an activity that has an effect on the environment below the levels prescribed by law does not, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, constitute an environmental harm for which the operator is legally responsible.\n\n338.\n\nThis legal situation continued, evidently without change, after the 2008 Constitution entered into force on 20 October 2008. There are numerous instances of the authorities deeming the presence of permitted substances associated with hydrocarbons activities within the limits prescribed by RAOHE and TULAS, as the case may be, to be legally permissible.\n\n339.\n\nFrom June to August 2009, Ecuambiente Consulting Group was commissioned by the OCP to carry out remediation of soil contaminated by a spill from the OCP pipeline in the Santa Rosa district.862 In a section of its report entitled, \"Legal Framework\", it stated \"[t]he project to remediate the contaminated soils created in the OCP spill must comply with the provisions of the Substitute Regulations of the Regulations for Hydrocarbon Operations in Ecuador (RAOHE) published in Official Registry No. 265 dated February 13, 2001, through Ministerial Agreement 1215, Table 6, which determines the parameters and permissible limits that must be controlled in the remediation of soils contaminated in all phases of the Hydrocarbons industry.\"863 It added that \"[i]n addition, the provisions of the United Text of Secondary Environmental Legislation, Book VI, Annex 2, must be taken into account, specifically Table 3, which stipulates the Remediation or Restoration criteria set according to the use of the soil.\" Nevertheless, \"[g]iven that the limits for Agricultural soil use in both Table 3 from TULAS and Table 6 from the RAOHE are similar for all the parameters being studied, those of Table 6 of the RAOHE 1213 will be taken as the officially stipulated ones.\"864\n\nExhibit CE-CC-231, Report on the Biorremediation of Contaminated Soils Generated by the OCP Spill, 2010, PER\\_CC0007205.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-231, Report on the Biorremediation of Contaminated Soils Generated by the OCP Spill, 2010, PER\\_CC0007205 (Section 3).\n\nExhibit CE-CC-231, Report on the Biorremediation of Contaminated Soils Generated by the OCP Spill, 2010, PER\\_CC0007205.\n\n340.\n\nThere is also the example of an *ex post* EIS for Coca-Payamino commissioned by Petroamazonas and conducted by ENTRIX in July 2010 in which it consistently compared the results of its samples to RAOHE and TULAS.865 Similarly, there is evidence that the Ministry routinely employed not just one land-use classification (i.e., sensitive ecosystems) from Table 6 of RAOHE, but all three of its land-use classifications.866\n\nCE-CC-241, PER\\_CC0008585 and PER\\_CC0008600: Table 3.1-4 and 8.6-2 refer to RAOHE and TULAS limits.\n\n1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraph 62.\n\n341.\n\nThis continued, and notably, in March 2011, a manual was developed with the involvement of PRAS (\" *Programa de Remediaci\u00f3n Ambiental y Social* \"), an agency within the Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment (and one with which one of the Ecuador's experts, Professor Crespo, was affiliated).867 The manual described the procedures used \"during the environmental remediation works carried out on the pits and flow lines of the Atacapi 2 oil well, in the Liberatador field\" between July 2009 and August 2010.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 926 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza); see Exhibit CE-CC-253, University of Guayaquil and Ministry of the Environment, Procedural Manual for the Remediation of Zones Contaminated due to the Hydrocarbons Industry: Pits and Flow Line of the Atacapi 2 Well, March 2011.\n\n342.\n\nDuring cross-examination, all the while noting that the \"document is not a regulation or standard, [it was] drafted in order to provide future manual users with guidelines in terms of environmental remediation techniques\",868 Professor Crespo was taken to relevant pages of the Manual which recorded that the criteria employed were \"based on [RAOHE]..., in its table 6... *which deals with the permissible limits for the identification and remediation of contaminated* *soils*.\"869 It followed on stating that in the case in question the parameters relating to \"agricultural land\" use would be applied.870 Professor Crespo acknowledged that in proposing to carry out its remediation program using the criteria in RAOHE, the agency was acting consistently with the 2008 Constitution.871\n\nExhibit CE-CC-253, University of Guayaquil and Ministry of the Environment, Procedural Manual for the Remediation of Zones Contaminated due to the Hydrocarbons Industry: Pits and Flow Line of the Atacapi 2 Well, March 2011, PER\\_CC0010261.\n\nQuote from Manual, p 14, Exhibit CE-CC-253, University of Guayaquil and Ministry of the Environment, Procedural Manual for the Remediation of Zones Contaminated due to the Hydrocarbons Industry: Pits and Flow Line of the Atacapi 2 Well, March 2011, quoted in Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 929 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza) [Emphasis added.].\n\nExhibit CE-CC-253, University of Guayaquil and Ministry of the Environment, Procedural Manual for the Remediation of Zones Contaminated due to the Hydrocarbons Industry: Pits and Flow Line of the Atacapi 2 Well, March 2011, p 14, as quoted in Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 929 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 930 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza).\n\n343.\n\nPerenco further pointed to statements of Minister Germ\u00e1nico Pinto and IEMS which, in its view, established that the permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS continued to be the applicable standards after the 2008 Constitution's promulgation. Minister Pinto, who became the Minister of Non-renewable Resources in June 2009, described his Ministry as the \"principal regulator of the hydrocarbons industry.\"872 He was also Petroecuador's Chairman of the Board and a member of Petroamazonas' Board at the time. On cross-examination, Minister Pinto agreed that Petroecuador and Petroamazonas were bound to apply RAOHE and the other applicable regulations in force in the performance of their functions.873\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 2, p 348 (Testimony of Germ\u00e1nico Pinto).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 2, p 355 (Testimony of Germ\u00e1nico Pinto).\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that IEMS' first expert report in *Burlington* characterised RAOHE and TULAS as representing the limits below which the Ecuadorian State had determined that \"on properties that are used for productive purposes related with petroleum activities, we tolerate certain concentrations of contaminants.\"874 IEMS did not use \"background values\" or \"[b]ase [v]alues\", but rather referred to the notion of \"tolerable\" levels of contaminants. It applied RAOHE and TULAS \"to establish whether the presence of contaminants at certain levels and components of the environment (soil, surface water and underground water) [was] tolerable.\"875\n\nExhibit CE-CC-251, IEMS Report in *Burlington*, PER \\_CC0010136-0010136.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-251, IEMS Report in *Burlington*, PER \\_CC0010136-0010137.\n\n345.\n\nIt was not until the filing of its second report in the *Burlington* proceeding that IEMS introduced the notion of \"background values\" or \"[b]ase [v]alues\" into its investigation of the Blocks, and there is an indication that this hypothesis was prompted by the instruction of the Office of the Attorney-General of Ecuador to \"[s]trengthe[n] the prior soil and groundwater results via the determination and evaluation of background levels for those contaminants whose presence may be attributable to natural conditions or other causes.\"876\n\nAs shall be seen, when it responded to the witness statement of Mr. Gilberto Mart\u00ednez filed with Perenco's Rejoinder, IEMS itself adverted to an instruction from the client to consider background values (see IEMS ER IV, p 8). Perenco also raised the example of IEMS' report in the ICSID case of *City Oriente v Ecuador* (Exhibit CE-CC-169), where IEMS referred to remediating affected areas up to the permissible limits set forth in RAOHE (Rejoinder, paragraph 73). See above at paragraph 208.\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see this instruction as nefarious; one can reasonably ask whether Articles 396 and 397 of the 2008 Constitution required a shift in the content and enforcement of Ecuadorian environmental law such as to incorporate background values as the regulatory regime's dominant criteria. But the evidence does not show that the 2008 Constitution prompted the Executive or the Congress to make significant changes to Ecuador's then-extant hydrocarbons environmental regulatory regime.\n\n347.\n\nNothing precludes Ecuador from promulgating new regulations that hold oilfield operators to more stringent environmental standards (or indeed to prohibit such activities altogether in areas which it considers to be ecologically sensitive), provided that this is done consistently with the Constitution's requirements and any international legal obligations voluntarily assumed by the State. Had the Tribunal been presented with evidence that all oilfield operators were being held to background values remediation standards after October 2008, it would have been bound to recognise that as a matter of Ecuadorian law a fundamental change in environmental law enforcement had been effected and that Perenco, like all other operators, was obliged to meet the higher standard that the State had seen fit to elaborate. Indeed, the Tribunal will do precisely that for the period in time in which the 2008 Constitution governed Perenco's operatorship.\n\n348.\n\nBut Perenco has shown that the Constitution did not change the substantive environmental standards to be applied to oilfield operations and seeking to hold an operator to \"background values\" standards said to be applicable as a matter of law in an international arbitration when the evidence points to less stringent standards that have been applied on a regular basis by the State - including to State-owned operators - outside of the arbitration, cannot be right as a matter of Ecuadorian law or international law. The Tribunal is concerned with Ecuadorian law and regulation as written and as applied.\n\n349.\n\nIt follows from the foregoing that Ecuador's primary case based on background values cannot be accepted in substitution for the applicable standards - both prior to and after the 2008 Constitution's entry into force. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to determine the many disputed issues pertaining to the background values methodology employed by IEMS and adopted by Ecuador.\n\n350.\n\nThis is not to say that as Ecuador's foundational governing law, the 2008 Constitution has no role to play in answering the questions presented to the Tribunal. It constitutes the State's supreme legal framework within which the Environmental Management Law, RAOHE, TULAS and other regulations specific to hydrocarbon activities within Ecuador must operate.877 Accordingly, where the Constitution has effected a change in the law, it must be given effect, although the Tribunal must ensure that the Constitution as a whole must be applied.878\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 209 (Opening Statement of Mark Friedman) (\"the basic structure of environmental protection\").\n\nArticle 11(6) of the 2008 Constitution provides that all constitutional rights are \"interdependent and hold equal stature.\" Article 427 provides that: \"Constitutional provisions shall be interpreted by the literal meaning of their wording that is most closely in line with the Constitution as a whole. In the event of any doubt, [constitutional provisions] shall be interpreted in the manner most favourable to the full force and effect of rights and that best respects the will of the constituent, in accordance with the general principles of constitutional interpretation.\" (Exhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution).\n\n351.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that IEMS prepared an alternative valuation approach based upon the criteria in RAOHE, Table 6, Annex 2, specifically, that applicable to sensitive ecosystems. For chemical indicators other than TPH, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cadmium, nickel and lead, such as \"electrical conductivity, pH, barium and vanadium\" it relied on Table 2 of TULAS.879 The situation with respect to the results of its groundwater sampling was different, IEMS explaining that while it similarly took the view that Base Values should be applied this was not feasible in the circumstances and relied on the values in Table 5, Annex 1, Book VI of TULAS.880\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 280; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 166; IEMS ER I, pp 2127; 48-61.\n\nIEMS ER I, section 2.5.2; IEMS ER II, pp 151-163; Ecuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 805; Reply, section 2.1.4\n\n**(3) Conclusion on the Relationship Between the Constitution and the Hydrocarbons Environmental Regulations**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal does not accept that the 2008 Constitution *per se* establishes the applicable technical standards governing the environmental conditions in the Blocks. The Constitution's provisions might have relevance to providing answers to specific issues that arise in this counterclaim. However, insofar as the environmental aspects of hydrocarbons operations are concerned, the Tribunal must look at the Ecuadorian technical standards as promulgated by the relevant bodies of the Ecuadorian State and as applied \"on the ground\" both before and after the 2008 Constitution's promulgation. Subject to the Tribunal's further findings on the applicable regulatory criteria, this is the case that Perenco must meet.\n\n**(4) Does the Constitution's Strict Liability Regime Apply to Perenco's Activities Conducted Prior to 20 October 2008?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nWith respect to the temporal application of the 2008 Constitution, given that Article 13.1 holds that the constitutional rights and guarantees are of \"immediate application\", the Tribunal is bound to hold that for any contamination in excess of regulatory standards shown to have occurred after 20 October 2008 up until the Consortium suspended operations on 16 July 2009, in accordance with the Constitution, Perenco is strictly liable.\n\n354.\n\nEcuador has gone further to argue that the promulgation of the 2008 Constitution means that since the counterclaim was filed after the new Constitution's entry into force, and since the Constitution created strict liability for environmental claims, *all* of Perenco's activities and any contamination occurring prior to 20 October 2008 are to be evaluated within that new legal framework with the result that Ecuador is relieved of the need to prove any fault, even though a fault-based regime governed Perenco's oilfield activities (and those of its predecessors) prior to 20 October 2008.881 According to Ecuador, as of 20 October 2008, fault became irrelevant to establishing Perenco's liability.\n\nImplicit in the Tribunal's description of the issue above is a finding that the 1998 Constitution did not itself create a strict liability regime and the Tribunal's rejection of Ecuador's argument based on Article 20 of the 1998 Constitution. On the Tribunal's reading, the phrase \". shall be obligated to compensate individuals for the damages caused as a consequence of the defective provision of public services or of the acts of their public servants and employees, in the performance of their duties\" does not amount to a strict liability regime. However, the Tribunal is of the view that decisions of the Ecuadorian courts have strengthened the presumptions in favour of a finding of liability in the case of damage caused through hazardous activities.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that even on Ecuador's appraisal of the strict liability regime, it is not so strict as to admit of no exceptions. In Ecuador's view, there was a \"presumption of causation\" and \"Perenco can only escape liability by establishing that the contamination was caused by *force majeure*, Ecuador or a third party.\"882At another point in its post-hearing submissions, Ecuador repeated this point in similar terms: \"As a result of the presumption of causation established by the 2008 Constitution, the entity responsible for operations in an adversely impacted area bears the burden of demonstrating that such an impact was not caused by its own operations.\"883\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 7.\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 45\n\n356.\n\nWith respect to Ecuador's contention that the entirety of Perenco's operatorship is to be adjudged under the 2008 Constitution's strict liability regime, the Tribunal does not read the \"immediate application\" text of the Constitution to have retroactive effect. The general rule under Ecuadorian law is that laws may not in principle be given retroactive effect and that rule has been continued in the 2008 Constitution.884 The Tribunal is aware of the \"public order\" exception to the Constitution's prohibition against the retroactive application of law, but it has not been satisfactorily shown that this has occurred in Ecuadorian legal practice.885 The Tribunal therefore does not agree with Ecuador's arguments in favour of giving the Constitution's regime of strict liability an application which to the Tribunal appears to be retroactive.886 Based on its understanding of the Ecuadorian case law that the Parties put before the Tribunal in their pleadings and reviewed with the legal experts at the hearing, a distinction must be drawn between the pre-and post-2008 constitutional regimes.\n\nExhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, Articles 76(3) and 86.\n\nOn cross-examination, Professor Andrade acknowledged that he had not shown any case in which an Ecuadorian court had applied any Ecuadorian Constitution retroactively on grounds of public order. Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, p 989 (Testimony of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez): \"Q: In those 30-odd years, on your theory, the Constitution could have been applied retroactively by the Ecuadorian courts that whole time? A: It could have been, yes. Q: Now, in your report you don't provide any case in which the Ecuadorian courts have actually done that, do you? A: No, I don't.\"\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Submission, paragraphs 21-22.\n\n357.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that where a particular regime that can give rise to damages claims has governed the conduct of a complex activity such as hydrocarbons exploitation, although the standards can be made more stringent with respect to activities engaged in *after* their entry into force, in respect of attempts to impose tortious liability after the fact, an operator can in general be held only to the legal standards that applied to its conduct at the time. Accordingly, for the period commencing 4 September 2002,887 when Perenco acquired its interests in the Blocks from Kerr-McGee, through to 19 October 2008,888 the Tribunal must apply the fault-based regime. This does not mean that certain issues cannot be affected by subsequent constitutional action, but it does mean that the basic legal standards against which Perenco was to conduct itself cannot later be changed and applied retroactively to impose liability where none existed under the then-applicable standard.\n\nExhibits CE-27, Assignment Contract of Kerr-McGee's interest in the Participation Contract for Block 21 to Perenco and Burlington, 4 September 2002 (in Spanish), and CE-28, Assignment Contract of Kerr-McGee's interest in the Participation Contract for Block 7 to Perenco and Burlington, 4 September 2002 (in Spanish).\n\nThe 2008 Constitution was publiched in Official Register No. 449 on 20 October 2008: see EL-89, 2008 Constitution.\n\n358.\n\nAll of this said, the Tribunal adds that having regard to the way in which Ecuadorian case law has developed, it does not see major differences between the two regimes given that: (i) it appears that ultimately all of the experts agreed that even under the strict liability regime there are still questions of causation;889 and (ii) Ecuadorian law prior to 2008 presumed that the party engaged in a harmful activity was responsible for any environmental damage and the burden shifted to that party to demonstrate that some other party was responsible. As the Tribunal understands the law, prior to 2008 Ecuadorian law created a strong presumption that the operator was responsible for the damage and this presumption could only be rebutted by demonstrating that some other party was responsible.\n\nPerenco's Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 19, and the record references cited thereto.\n\n**(5) Conclusion on the Strict Liability Regime's Application**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nIn sum, the 2008 Constitution applies to any post-20 October 2008 damage resulting from regulatory exceedances. For any damage occurring during this period up to its being succeeded by Ecuador in operating the Blocks, Perenco is strictly liable. Perenco has asserted that no such damage occurred during this period, so if that is correct, the strict liability regime does not have any application to this dispute in practical terms; whether Perenco is correct that no damage occurred after the Constitution's entry in force remains to be seen.890 In cases of doubt, where it appears that the damage might have occurred prior to that time, the fault-based liability regime which applied to Perenco from the date of its acquiring its interests in the Blocks until 20 October 2008 must apply.\n\nDuring his cross-examination, Mr. Wilfrido Saltos testified that on 11 July 2009 (i.e., after the 2008 Constitution entered into force), there was an 11 barrel spill in Block 7 which was \"reported by an association of farmers that are within the operational area of the Payamino Field. This group is called Los Vencedores.\" He indicated that the spill had been cleaned up. Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1438-1439 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos). Perenco observed in its Post-Hearing Reply Brief that in a lawsuit (the *Los Vencedores* case) the Court of Appeals of the Orellana District upheld the lower court's dismissal of the claim on the basis that the Ministry of Environment had certified that Perenco had complied with the environmental remediation plan. (Perenco's Reply Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 13.)\n\n**(6) The Time Bar Defence**\n----------------------------\n\n360.\n\nTurning to Perenco's contention that the claim is partly time-barred by virtue of the application of Article 2235 of the Civil Code, Ecuador has responded that that rule can only apply to a fault-based regime and since 2008 the regime has been one of strict liability based on the imprescriptibility of environmental claims.891 As for claims relating to events occurring before that date, Ecuador argued that even if it was wrong that the 2008 Constitution could have retroactive effect, when it came to a limitation period issue, in the *Nelson Alc\u00edvar* case the court applied Article 396.4 (pursuant to which environmental claims cannot expire).\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 24;\n\n361.\n\nThere is no time bar for the claim insofar as it relates to events occurring after the 2008 Constitution's entry into force. As for claims arising out of the prior fault-based regime and outside of the Civil Code's four year period, the imprescriptibility provision of the 2008 Constitution does have an impact on Perenco's limitations period defence. Statutes of limitation are of a procedural nature and since the claim as a whole was brought after October 2008, the Civil Code's rule gives way to Article 396.892\n\nAnnex No. 29 to Expert Report of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez (\"TWELFTH. - Regarding the substantive matter, this Chamber has considered, and believes pertinent to note in this case, that the environmental action to request redress for harm, cannot be classified as equal, in any way, to the civil action for damages. Both protect legal assets of a completely different relevance. The environmental action protects a common good that is essential to humanity's existence, and therefore, it is logical that the current Constitution does not contemplate a term for a statute of limitations for this type of action, as noted by Art. 396 of the Supreme State Rule. The action that is only Civil for damages, instead, protects other legal assets, related to the property of the individual that, although they are important, do not have relevance to the collective right to the environment. For this reason, for example the statute of limitations for actions for damages that are only civil is limited, as per Art. 2235 of the Civil Code. It is important that we highlight that the constitutional principle that states that in doubt, the rule that most favors environmental protection shall apply, as it is a standard that generates ample protection, the matters contemplated by the current Constitution will apply, as it is a standard that creates a broad protection to the environment, above the matters outlined by the Environmental Management Law or the 1998 Constitution. The provisions of the current Constitution as it relates to environmental issues and its protection is also preferably applied, since, in procedural matters, the rules in force at the time of filing the action apply, and not those that were in force when the legal situation was created. In this case, we observe the moment on which the appeal was filed for application of constitutional rules in procedural matters, related to the environmental case, in application of the provisions of Art. 7, point 20 of the Civil Code).\n\n362.\n\nAt the hearing, Professor Andrade testified against the strict application of a four-year limitation period where the harm may not be discoverable within that period after the act has occurred. In his opinion, \"not even in the system of general liability has this norm been applied in that way.\"893 Ecuador found support for this view in the \"generally accepted maxim *agere non valentem non currit praescriptio* (that is, the period of statute of limitation does not run for he who cannot assert a claim).\"894 Ecuador argued that otherwise a claim for an environmental harm would expire every time the harm was neither disclosed by the perpetrator nor readily apparent (as in the present case).895\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, pp 960-961 (Testimony of Fabi\u00e1n Andrade Narv\u00e1ez).\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 25.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 8, p 2160 (Closing Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero); Ecuador's Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 25.\n\n363.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Perenco's expert, Dr Bed\u00f3n, appeared to hold the same view in one of his prior writings where he asserted that \"continued environmental harm should be subject to the normal statutory limitation relating to torts of four years, but starting from the discovery of the harm.\"896 Perenco conceded that Dr Bed\u00f3n made such a comment, but argued that this was his view *de lege ferenda*.897\n\nExhibit EL-191 (translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013)\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 43.\n\n**(7) Conclusion on the Time Bar Defence**\n------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that because of the peremptory wording of Article 396, the four-year limitation period defence is to be rejected. Its view of this effect of Article 396 is supported by certain additional factors, namely: (i) the court in the *Nelson Alc\u00edvar* case applied Article 396.4 after the Constitution's entry into force to a case where the damage occurred prior to that date;898 (ii) Ecuadorian law does not give preclusive effect to any audit performed at the request of an operator even if approved by state agencies (although this does not exclude an audit's use as evidence in discharging its burden of proof);899 (iii) the administration of the environmental laws depends upon the operator's self-reporting; and (iv) as Perenco's witness, Mr. Wilfrido Saltos himself acknowledged (see below), it is sometimes difficult to ascertain exactly when and where oilfield environmental contamination has occurred. These factors, considered in light of Article 396, argue in favour of an interpretation of Ecuadorian law which is to be resolved in favour of the protection of the environment. Thus, a four-year limitation period which is said to admit of no discovery exception must yield to Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Perenco argued that the *Nelson Alc\u00edvar* case was wrongly decided. This may be so, but as found in the Tribunal's earlier Decision on the Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability, the Tribunal must seek to apply Ecuadorian law as the Ecuadorian courts have applied it. See Decision, paragraph 331.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 68 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero); referring to Exhibit EL-146, TULAS, Book VI, Art. 70: \"the approval of environmental management plans, and other environmental studies shall not be used as exonerating evidence in environmental contamination incidents or accidents attributable to any activity, project or construction.\"\n\n**(8) The Legal Effect of Petroamazonas' Succeeding Perenco in Blocks 7 and 21**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n365.\n\nEcuador has argued that the combined effect of the 2008 Constitution's emphasis on \"full restoration\" as well as various provisions of the Participation Contracts means that Perenco must put the two Blocks back into their pre-existing condition, that is, their state prior to the commencement of hydrocarbons exploitation. The Tribunal considers this to be impossible given the fact that the Blocks continue to be used for oil production.\n\n366.\n\nPerenco adduced extensive evidence showing that when Petroamazonas took over Blocks 7 and 21, it proceeded to undertake a significant expansion of the operational capacity of the Blocks, and in so doing has drilled 78 new wells, has built new mud pits and is estimated to be producing about twice the amount of oil that Perenco was producing in July 2009.900 A new pipeline is being constructed by Petroamazonas in areas where IEMS considered that Perenco is liable to remediate the land.901 Perenco argued that it cannot be under a legal obligation to pay the cost of removing platforms, piplines, and other appurtenances of oilfield operations that are still being used or even expanded upon by the succeeding operator. Perenco noted, for example, that some areas alleged to be contaminated such as the new pipeline's right of way, where contamination was detected by IEMS, are said to be covered by the environmental claim.902\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 174-176 (Opening Statement of Mark Friedman).\n\nA reference to the SOTE pipeline: Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 176 (Opening Statement of Mark Friedman).\n\nExamples of this as submitted by Perenco are the Coca 13 site, the Coca 18-19 wells, Oso A: Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 174-178 (Opening Statement of Mark Friedman).\n\n367.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that it makes little sense to assume away the existence of Petroamazonas' activities and posit a remediation target which would imagine that the Blocks are no longer used for the production of oil at all. The Participation Contracts have been brought to an end. Petroamazonas has taken over the Blocks and continues to operate them and has expanded production thereon. The Tribunal cannot ignore this significant fact.\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises that with the passage of time, in the course of conducting oilfield operations, Petroamazonas might have caused spills and other contamination. The key period of time was that falling between July 2009 and the time in which the Parties' experts conducted their sampling activities. During this period, it is possible that the condition of the Blocks could have been adversely affected by the succeeding operator and this must be borne in mind. To the extent that there is any evidence of environmental harm occurring in the Blocks during the post-16 July 2009 period, Perenco bears no liability. Under the 2008 Constitution, Petroamazonas is strictly liable for any such contamination.\n\n369.\n\nIt can reasonably be asked why a company whose ownership interests in the Blocks have been brought to an end is nevertheless to be held responsible for any contamination in excess of regulatory standards which occurred while it was the operator. The Tribunal considers that this question is answered by the fact that it has already been established in the Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability that Ecuador was in breach of its contractual and Treaty obligations. As a result, Perenco has the right to the payment of compensation in accordance with the applicable legal standards governing quantum as if it had continued to perform the Participation Contracts in the absence of the breaches. In circumstances where the State's breaches are appropriately compensated, and at the end of its contracts' terms, the contractor is obliged to return the Blocks in a suitable condition, the assumption must be that the private contractor itself would act consistently with its public and private law obligations.903 In light of the foregoing analysis, it need hardly be said that the Tribunal rejects Perenco's alternative argument (based on the 2008 Constitution) that it bears no responsibility for the Blocks on the ground that since Petroamazonas is now the operator, it has substituted for Perenco as the succeeding operator.904\n\nUnder the Participation Contracts Perenco is responsible for any environmental damage resulting from its operatorship, as well as its positive obligations to \"[t]ake responsibility for the cleanup and reforestation of the area with species similar to those originally found at the site, in order to, with time, allow the potential return to environmental conditions similar to those encountered at the beginning of the operations\", Perenco must bear the cost of remediating the damage and for those areas in which its oilfield activities were retired by taking the appropriate cleanup and reforestation measures. (See Exhibit CE-17/CE-CC-28, Block 7 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04764, 04768, 04769 ; Exhibit CE-10/CE-CC-13, Block 21 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04659. Above at paragraph 81.)\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 32.\n\n**(9) Conclusion on the Succession of the Operatorship**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the only remediation obligation that Perenco can have is for regulatory exceedances that predate Petroamazonas' activities and which themselves have not been overtaken by Petroamazonas' new works.\n\n**(10) The Tribunal's Approach to the Fault-based Regime**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n371.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, having regard to the Ecuadorian case law, the approach taken by the Ecuadorian courts prior to 2008 was to employ a relatively stringent burden of proof rule which presumed that the operator engaged in a hazardous activity and benefiting therefrom was responsible for any resulting damage.905 This, however, is a rebuttable presumption.\n\nIn *Delfina Torres*, the court held that: \"The claimant had to prove: a) the harm of which it claims it is a victim; b) its amount or quantum; and c) the events that caused the harm.\" Exhibit EL-145, *Delfina Torres*, p 32.\n\n372.\n\nIn considering the burden of proof, the Tribunal is mindful of the problems of proof when an oilfield is operated over a period of years by a single operator or, to make matters more complicated, by successive operators. The problem here is that the environmental claim is not based on a single event but rather on an accumulation of discrete events occurring at different sites at different times (and in circumstances where the operator is itself responsible for reporting any spills or other contamination). How, for example, does a tribunal differentiate between the acts of successive operators or even differentiate between the cumulative effect of the acts of the same operator on a particular platform? While it agrees with Perenco that it cannot presume that Perenco is the author of all harm that has been detected, once a regulatory exceedance resulting from a potentially hazardous activity is shown, Perenco is *prima facie* responsible therefor.\n\n373.\n\nProof of causation in relation to an environmental tort raises very difficult issues. How is the Tribunal to determine whether the operator fell below its duty of care in every specific instance of contamination? The *Delfina Torres* case speaks of the \"events that caused the harm\"; this could be taken to refer to specifically identified acts of negligence; equally it could refer to the carrying on of a particular hazardous activity that is likely to cause harm.906 If the latter conception is to be applied, the oil industry would seem to be such an activity.\n\nReferring to the *Delfina Torres*, *Medardo Luna* and *Andrade Medina* cases, at paragraph 39, Perenco's Post-Hearing Brief puts the matter thus: \"All of these cases confirm that prior to the 2008 Constitution the liability of an operator of a hazardous activity requires fault as a constitutive element, but that fault is rebuttably presumed.\"\n\n374.\n\nGiven the special difficulties attendant in proving the commission of an environmental tort, it appears to the Tribunal to be wrong in principle that an operator can simply plead that a spill occurred in the ordinary course of business and it is not liable therefor unless it is proved to have acted negligently. The Tribunal is thus inclined to employ a strong rebuttable presumption that if there is a regulatory exceedance, that in itself is evidence of fault. Any alternative approach would make it too onerous for a claimant because it would likely lack sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the operator failed in its duty of care in many if not most instances in which regulatory exceedances have occurred. The Tribunal considers that regulatory exceedances are indicative of operational failures and therefore should be taken as falling below the standard of care.\n\n375.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this approach is also consonant with industry practice. The Participation Contracts excluded environmental damage caused by the State before the start of the Contracts' terms (in Block 7's case, before the start of the term of the original Service Contract, and in the case of Block 21, before the start of the term of the Participation Contract). This of course required a succeeding operator to evaluate the state of the Blocks in order to avoid the possibility of its later being held liable for the acts of its predecessor. If it did not take steps to ascertain the Blocks' condition, it ran the risk that it could be held liable for the acts of its predecessor due to the challenge of proving that the predecessor caused the environmental contamination.\n\n376.\n\nThereafter, the Participation Contracts left it to the contractor to ensure that the environmental conditions were preserved. They are clear that the contractor was responsible to ensure that no environmental harm was caused by its activities, and a failure to do so would entail its liability. To the extent that one operator was succeeded by another operator, the industry practice was that the succeeding operator would conduct its own audit with a view to ensuring that it did not inherit an environmental liability for which it might be held responsible.907 In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that it was for the contractors to allocate the risks *inter se* to determine where liability for environmental damage arising during the course of the Participation Contracts would land. This was not a matter for the State to determine.908\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1592-1594 (Testimony of Alex Mart\u00ednez): \"Q: In this case you just happened to acquire a company that had an interest in Ecuador, so you were essentially buying whatever they had. But is it my understanding, then, that if - is this the practice in the oil industry that buying a specific asset, so going into a specific operation you would want to know what - whether there was contamination in the oil fields that has been caused by the previous operator for the purposes of allocating responsibility? A: That's correct. That's the normal process. We go and do due diligence on that particular asset to the best of our capability. I mean, that's--you know, we'd do as much as we could to figure out what was there. And we will do that. I mean, other properties that we've, you know, we've gone through an acquisition, we'll go in and make sure our agency folks go and review all of that. So, yes. That's a normal practice, except in this case I was telling--at least for ConocoPhillips.\"\n\nEcuador contends that this was accepted by Perenco, which in practice and in its evidence in this arbitration demonstrates it as remediating contamination left behind by the previous operator in the Blocks (referring to the evidence of Mr. Saltos, in particular). Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 77 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\n377.\n\nTurning to the terms of the Participation Contracts, the way in which Clause 5.1.20.10 was framed indicated that as between Petroecuador and the private contractor, there was a clear and general imposition of responsibility on the State for the Blocks' condition at the time of the first private contractor's commencement of operations. Likewise, the contractor bore responsibility for their return to their original environmental condition. This suggests that the contractual regime was broadly consistent with the fault-based regime, and even with the strict liability regime later established by the 2008 Constitution. (The Tribunal recalls Ecuador's disclaiming that its claim in the current proceeding sounded in contract. For the Tribunal, the Participation Contracts' relevance to the present case lies in their general approach to environmental stewardship and the Blocks' conditions at the time of their surrender.)\n\n378.\n\nGiven the problems of proof when seeking to shift responsibility for tortious claims, it is possible that an operator might end up being found liable for an act of contamination possibly caused by its predecessor. The best way for the contractor to protect its legal interests was for it to comprehensively document the environmental condition of the Blocks at the time that it assumed responsibility for them.\n\n**(11) Conclusion on the Fault-based Regime**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nIn sum, if a regulatory exceedance occurred, Perenco is to be taken to have fallen below the requisite duty of care and will be held liable unless it can prove on a preponderance of evidence: (i) an occurrence of a *force majeure* event; (ii) that it did not fall below the standard of care in respect of that specific instance of contamination; or (iii) that some other person caused the harm.\n\n**(12) Determining the State of Blocks 7 and 21 at the Time of Perenco's Acquisition of its Interests**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nIn both the Parties' written pleadings and in their experts' reports, there was considerable debate over whether certain instances of contamination were attributable to the actions of Perenco or to other parties who carried on operations in what became Blocks 7 and 21 before Perenco arrived on the scene. In view of the Tribunal's finding that under the fault-based regime Perenco can avoid liability if it can demonstrate that a particular instance of contamination resulted from the acts of another person, this necessarily requires the Tribunal to consider the environmental condition of the two Blocks at the time that Perenco acquired its interests from Kerr-McGee.\n\n381.\n\nIn response to a question from the Tribunal, Mr. Alexis Mart\u00ednez, a witness for Perenco, explained the general practice of oil companies when it comes to acquiring interests in ongoing operations. Mr. Mart\u00ednez testified that: (i) an incoming operator seeks to ascertain the extent of any existing environmental liabilities by conducting some form of audit prior to or immediately upon acquiring its interest (as in fact Oryx did when it became involved with the Blocks909, ConocoPhillips did when it acquired Burlington's assets in Ecuador910 and, as Mr. Saltos appeared to recall, Perenco did when it acquired its interests in the Blocks);911 (ii) incoming operators typically obtain representations and warranties from their predecessor-in-interest on the block's environmental condition as at the time of its sale;912 and (iii) purchasers typically require the inclusion of indemnification provisions in the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) so that they may be indemnified for any liability for contamination which is attributable to their predecessor.913\n\nExhibit E-261, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Coca-Payamino Field dated May 1994; see also, Exhibit E-260, Laboratory result for water sample from swamp nearby Payamino 2 & 8, 6 October 1992; Exhibit CE-CC-12, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company - Coca-Payamino Field, Audit Utilized for the Transfer of Operations of the Coca-Payamino Unified Field from Petroproducci\u00f3n to Oryx on February 12, 1994, performed by Ecomapa/Western Oilfield.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-126, HSE & SD Assessment and Other Technical Services, Assets in Ecuador, Report prepared by ERM for Conoco-Phillips, dated November 2006, PER\\_CC0004260.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1509-1511 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos): \"Q: Now, did Perenco, by the way, undertake a similar type of audit or assessment when it took over the works or the oil field operations in or around 2002?

It was a compliance audit, and this was done under the environmental regulations and because it was requested of us by DINAPA. Q. Okay. But set aside the biannual audit for a moment. Perenco also undertook an internal audit when it took over the works in or around 2002; correct? A. Yes. That was the usual pracyice of Perenco up to McGee [sic] and also Oryx.\"\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1590-1591 (Testimony of Alex Mart\u00ednez).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n382.\n\nThis sort of appraisal was performed by Oryx when it took over operations in the Coca-Payamino Field in 1994. The introduction to its May 1994 Environmental Assessment stated in this regard that, \"[t]he objective of this assessment was to determine the current environmental status of all sites and facilities to support the take over of operations by Oryx on February 12, 1994.\"914 The 141-page document contained appendices which included a file of the correspondence between Oryx and *Petroproducci\u00f3n* and the daily production reports that the latter sent to Oryx, a database compiled from site summary sheets and site status tables, and a copy of the completed inspection checklists.915 Although in some respects the report was quite comprehensive, regrettably for the purposes of the present proceeding, the consultants did not perform sampling. The report notes in this regard:\n\nBased on the visual inspection of the sites and the spills identified the level of contamination is deemed to be minimal. However, as this study did not include sampling and analysis, no confirmation of contamination levels can be made.916\n\nExhibit E-261, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Coca-Payamino Field dated May 1994, p 8 in the document.\n\nExhibit E-261, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Coca-Payamino Field dated May 1994, pp 9-10 in the document.\n\nExhibit E-261, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Coca-Payamino Field dated May 1994, p 4. See also, CE-CC-21, Environmental Audit of *Petroproducci\u00f3n* 's Operation of the Coca-Payamino Field, January 1999, PER\\_CC0001020 (\"Photos of well sites and facilities are included in Appendix B. Note that no sampling of soils, surface or groundwater was conducted during the audit and that the recommendations are based on visual observations.\").\n\n383.\n\nOne other fact emerges from the report. It noted the absence of an incident reporting system on *Petroproducci\u00f3n'* s part:\n\nThere is presently no reporting or written procedures within PetroProducci\u00f3n [sic] for environmental pollution or spill incident reporting. An incident reporting system should be put in place as soon as possible.917\n\nExhibit E-261, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Coca-Payamino Field dated May 1994, p 6.\n\n384.\n\nThus, the 1994 report is not of much assistance other than it shows how Oryx sought to evaluate what it was taking on, that at the time of its entry into the field, the level of contamination was deemed to be minimal, and *Petroproducci\u00f3n* 's environmental monitoring practices were considered to be rudimentary.\n\n385.\n\nThere are other such studies on the record. For example, when Oryx was negotiating to resume the operatorship of the Coca-Payamino Field (it evidently had been operated by *Petroproducci\u00f3n* for some eighteen months), a Mr. Patrick Grizzle (who appears to have been an Oryx employee918) conducted an inspection from 12 to 14 January 1998. Mr. Grizzle's view was that environmental conditions had deteriorated in the period during which the field was being operated by *Petroproducci\u00f3n* and he was critical of its operatorship. Oryx had operated the field from 1995 to 1997 and Mr. Grizzle recorded what he viewed as backsliding from many of Oryx's better practices. He appears to have reached this conclusion entirely on visual inspections (many photographs are attached to the report). Once again, according to the report, no sampling of soils, surface water or groundwater were taken.919\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 442.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-21, Environmental Audit of Petroproducci\u00f3n's Operation of the Coca-Payamino Field, January 1999, PER\\_CC0001020 (\"Note that no sampling of soils, surface or groundwater was conducted during the audit and that the recommendations are based on visual observations.\").\n\n386.\n\nThe question naturally arises as to what Perenco did when it succeeded Kerr-McGee. Mr. Saltos was questioned about this and his exchange with counsel went as follows:\n\nQ. Now, in 1994, Oryx assumed operations for the Coca-Payamino Field; correct?\n\nA. Yes. Within the context of the Unified Operation Agreement.\n\nQ. Okay, sir. And if you could look to Tab 15, this is an environmental assessment of the Coca-Payamino Field; correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Which was undertaken by--or conducted by or on behalf of Oryx after it took over this field; correct?\n\nA. Can you repeat, please.\n\nQ. And this environmental assessment was undertaken on behalf of Oryx in February 1994, as it was taking over the Coca-Payamino Field; correct?\n\nA. Yes. Specifically here, it says May 1994. That is to say, after they took over the operations area.920\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1507-1508 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos).\n\n387.\n\nMr. Saltos was asked whether the same sort of exercise was conducted by Perenco:\n\nA. Yes, an assessment was conducted also.\n\nQ. And to be clear, you're not referring to the biannual audit that was submitted or conducted on behalf of Perenco for the purposes of the--of its regulatory requirements. You're talking about an internal Perenco assessment audit; is that correct?\n\nA. No. The biannual audit was not internal in nature. It was a compliance audit, and this was done under the environmental regulations and because it was requested of us by DINAPA.\n\nQ. Okay. But set aside the biannual audit for a moment. Perenco also undertook an internal audit when it took over the works in or around 2002; correct?\n\nA. Yes. That was the usual practice of Perenco up to McGee [sic] and also Oryx.\n\nQ. (Overlapping translation)\u2014to understake internal assessments or audits when they took over the works--responsibility for the works; correct?\n\nA. Yes. When there was a change in the operatorship or--also, well, yearly to assess the conditions of the environmental management in the Blocks.\"921\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1526-1527 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos).\n\n388.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal requested Perenco to conduct a search for the evaluation that Mr. Saltos recalled having been conducted. Counsel for Perenco subsequently advised that: \"Regarding the Tribunal's request for a 2002 study \u2018done of the state of the Blocks' at the time of Perenco's acquisition thereof... no written report was ever prepared of the inspection made at that time.\"922\n\nLetter dated 6 November 2013 from Debevoise & Plimpton to the Tribunal's Secretary.\n\n389.\n\nThe Tribunal takes from this response that Perenco's position is that an inspection was conducted, but unlike Oryx/Kerr-McGee and Burlington, Perenco did not have it reduced to writing. The Tribunal finds this to be surprising because it seems obvious that a prudent operator would conduct a reasonably comprehensive written study of the condition of the blocks that it was taking over.923 Thus, a contemporaneous written appraisal of the Blocks' conditions in 2002 from Perenco's point of view - the party who presumably would be most interested in ensuring that it was not taking on the possibility of being held liable for the acts of its predecessor - was not prepared.\n\nThe Report prepared for ConocoPhillips was 191 pages in length (Exhibit CE-CC-126, HSE & SD Assessment and Other Technical Services, Assets in Ecuador, Report prepared by ERM for Conoco-Phillips, dated November 2006); Mr. Grizzle's January 1999 report on the Coca-Payomino Field was 123 pages long (Exhibit CE-CC-21, Environmental Audit of Petroproducci\u00f3n's Operation of the Coca-Payamino Field, January 1999) and Oryx's 1994 report on the Coca-Payomino Field was 141 pages long (Exhibit E-261, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Coca-Payamino Field dated May 1994).\n\n390.\n\nThe absence of such a study assumes further significance when one considers that although a third party audit of both blocks was performed in 2002 (evidently initiated when Kerr-McGee was the operator but concluded at around the time that Perenco acquired its interests), Perenco inexplicably did not have the 2004 audits performed as required by the Ecuadorian regime. The absence of a study at the time of acquisition combined with the failure to perform the 2004 audit after it assumed control of the Blocks suggests a less than complete concern about ascertaining the environmental conditions.\n\n391.\n\nReasoning that the parties to the Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) would likely have allocated risks between them with respect to environmental liabilities, the Tribunal requested a copy of Perenco's Purchase and Sale Agreement with Kerr-McGee. This was produced by Perenco after the hearing. Section 9 of the agreement indicates that Perenco had recourse against Kerr-McGee for any damage that occurred as a result of its operations prior to 13 December 2001 by means of an indemnification action for monetary loss.\n\n392.\n\nThe Kerr-McGee/Perenco Purchase and Sale Agreement PSA provides an indication of the Blocks' condition at the time of Perenco's acquisition because the vendor represented and warranted that it had complied with all applicable Ecuadorian Laws relating to the environment, with the exception of certain matters listed in two schedules to the Contracts.\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it helpful to quote the relevant provision of the PSA in full:\n\n**Section 3.9**  **Environmental Laws**... KMEEC [Kerr-McGee] has complied with, and, to KMEEC's knowledge (after making an investigation of Seller's records and an inquiry to KMEEC's personnel), operations related to the Assets have been in compliance with, all applicable Ecuadorian Laws relating to the environment, including without limitation, Ecuadorian Laws relating to (a) the control of any potential pollutant, or protection of the air, water or land, (b) solid, gaseous or liquid waste generation, handling, treatment, storage, disposal, transportation or remediation, (c) exposure to hazardous or toxic substances, and (d) protection of wildlife or indigenous people or historic resources (\"Environmental Laws\"). Except as set forth in Schedule 3.9(a), to KMEEC's knowledge (after making an investigation of KMEEC's records and an inquiry to KMEEC's personnel), all hazardous materials generated from the use, construction or operation of the Assets have been handled and disposed of in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws... To KMEEC's knowledge (after making an investigation of KMEEC's records and an inquiry to KMEEC's personnel), there has been no contamination of, or releases into, groundwater, surface water, or soil on the Contract Areas resulting from activities related to the Assets, which require remediation under applicable Environmental Laws (or would require remediation, were all facts known to applicable Governmental Authorities). Schedule 3.9(b) sets forth a list provided by KMEEC of all wells that have been drilled on the Contract Areas and the current status of each such well. To KMEEC's knowledge (after making an investigation of KMEEC's records and an inquiry to KMEEC's personnel), KMEEC is not aware of any wells on the Contract Areas where any different status of the wells on the Contract Areas, except as listed on Schedule 3.9(b). To KMEEC's knowledge (after making an investigation of KMEEC's records and an inquiry to KMEEC's personnel), all wells identified on Schedule 3.9(b) as having been abandoned have been properly plugged and abandoned in accordance with applicable Ecuadorian Laws.924\n\nExhibit CE-CC 414, Purchase and Sale Agreement between Kerr McGee and Perenco regarding Blocks 7 and 21, December 13, 2001, p 17 in document [Emphasis added.].\n\n394.\n\nClause 3.9 thus records Kerr-McGee's representation that it had complied with all applicable Ecuadorian environmental laws and that there were no exceedances *except* for those listed in Schedule 3.9(a). Reference to that schedule in turn shows the following steps that still had to be taken in order for Block 21 to be brought into compliance. Once again, the Tribunal quotes the schedule in full:\n\n**SCHEDULE 3.9(a)**\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**\n\n1. Letter, referenced DINAPA-CSA-160-2001-20001697, dated September 4, 2001 from DINAPA (Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Protecci\u00f3n Ambiental) to Operator regarding an environmental inspection completed by DINAPA of Block 21 and setting forth the following requirements:\n\n\u2022 Carry out maintenance of the drainage system around existing wells in the Yuralpa Field;\n\n\u2022 Recondition the site for classification of solid waste;\n\n\u2022 Relocate scrap existing in Operator's temporary camp;\n\n\u2022 Recondition the grease trap existing at the end of the diesel tank that supplies diesel to the power generator;\n\n\u2022 Remove soil contaminated with lubricant oil in the generator area;\n\n\u2022 Add the existing incinerator to the air monitoring plan;\n\n\u2022 Provide DINAPA with black water analyses of gray and black waters being discharged at the Operator's temporary camp;\n\n\u2022 Provide DINAPA with blackwater analyses of gray and black waters being injected underground by the seismic contractor and the stratographic profile of the respective wells; and\n\n\u2022 Conduct maintenance of existing slopes of roads that connect with the platforms in order to avoid landslides within the field.925\n\nExhibit CE-CC 414, Purchase and Sale Agreement between Kerr McGee and Perenco regarding Blocks 7 and 21, December 13, 2001, p 48 of PDF.\n\n395.\n\nAccording to the vendor and evidently after an inspection by DINAPA, these were the issues of non- or further compliance that needed to be addressed.\n\n396.\n\nSchedule 3.9(a) assumes some importance for the current proceeding. In the Tribunal's view, it has two consequences: First, Perenco cannot be held liable for exceedances or other environmental compliance measures listed in the Schedule since, by definition, they preceded its operatorship. Second (and conversely), if IEMS and/or GSI have found contamination in sites not listed in Schedule 3.9(a), it might well be that such contamination occurred after Perenco took possession.\n\n397.\n\nIn the next phase of this proceeding, it will be helpful to examine DINAPA-CSA-160-2001-20001697 if a copy of that letter can be located, because it sets out the authority's view of what needed to be done at the time in order to bring the Operator into compliance with its legal obligations. The Tribunal will call upon both Parties to conduct a diligent search of their respective files to determine whether they have in their possession any other such evaluations of the Blocks, whether performed by themselves or by another party such as Oryx/Kerr-McGee at around the time of Perenco's arrival at the scene.\n\n398.\n\nFor present purposes, while the Tribunal considers that Schedule 3.9(a) provides a helpful contemporaneous assessment of the Blocks, it cannot be considered to be a definitive and exhaustive analysis of their environmental condition. There might have been contamination of which Kerr-McGee was unaware or which it might have failed to disclose.926 There is no indication that Perenco challenged Kerr-McGee's list of noncompliant issues by informing it of contamination or other regulatory problems which had not been disclosed to it under Schedule 3.9(a) nor is there any evidence of Perenco's having ever complained to Kerr McGee that it had made anything other than an accurate disclosure.927 Schedule 3.9 (a) thus provides a starting point for distinguishing between any contamination that might have occurred prior to Perenco's acquisition of its interests and any contamination which occurred thereafter.\n\nThe Grizzle report of January 1999 noted above shows that there were spills in the Coca-Payamino Field well before Perenco arrived on the scene: see Exhibit CE-CC-21, Environmental Audit of Petroproducci\u00f3n's Operation of the Coca-Payamino Field, January 1999, PER\\_CC0001020-PER\\_CC0001022.\n\nAn example of this occurring in the case of Oryx can be seen at Exhibit CE-CC-9 (Letter of March 9, 1992 from Luis Cobos (Oryx) to Petroproducci\u00f3n), where on 9 March 1992, an Oryx Operations Manager wrote to the Senior Engineer of *Petroproducci\u00f3n* informing him that when clearing access to the Payamino-8 well, Oryx found a spill of crude oil in an area of approximately 50 x 100 metres which seemed to have been caused in the past by a defect in the test pit wall at the Payamino 2 well. The letter requested *Petroproducci\u00f3n* \"as the operator of the Unified Coca-Payamino Field\" to take \"the necessary measures and actions to resolve this situation as quickly as possible.\" (PER\\_CC-0000304).\n\n399.\n\nBefore leaving the PSA, the Tribunal notes that Section 3.9 referred to a second schedule, Schedule 3.9(b), which was a list of all wells in the Contract Area and a description of their status. This schedule was not included in Perenco's redacted version of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and should be produced in the next phase of this proceeding because it might shed additional light on the scope of Perenco's duty to remediate.\n\n400.\n\nThis takes the Tribunal to the third source of guidance. As Mr. Saltos noted in the testimony quoted above, a distinction is to be made between Perenco's evaluation of the Blocks for the purposes of acquiring its interests, and its statutory duty, as operator, to have an independent third party conduct a biennial audit.\n\n401.\n\nEcuador has characterised Perenco's position as being that \"because the audits that it conducted didn't show evidence of contamination, the Tribunal should be convinced that the Blocks are, in fact, clean\", a position, that counsel for Ecuador described as \"nonsense\", but to which he added:\n\nI should like to point out that this position is contradictory with Perenco's allegations that all of the environmental harm was already there when it began operations. In fact, if that was the case, then the pollution should obviously have surfaced at the start of Perenco's operations, and Perenco should have made the necessary reservations to make sure that it would not be made liable for the harm... \"928\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 75-76 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\n402.\n\nThere is a logic to Ecuador's position. The 2002 environmental audits for Blocks 7 and 21 showed little in the way of contamination.929 A review of the Block 7 audit shows that in general terms, the Blocks did not exhibit major nonconformities. Of 14 groundwater samples noted at Table 4-7 of the Audit, only one (at Payamino Camp) showed an exceedance above Table 4(a) of RAOHE.930 There were certain other nonconformities in other areas. For example, on infrastructure, the Audit noted:\n\n**IV.8.1.1** ***Infrastructure***\n\n\u2022 Nonconformity with drainage systems is minor, given that there is a partial and inefficient system available.\n\n\u2022 Major nonconformity is caused by poor functionality of concrete areas of retention near the drill hole in all platforms.\n\n\u2022 Protection structure (buckets) show conformity in most stations and platforms, except for Payamino 2, Oso 1, Lobo 3 and 4 which present major nonconformity de [sic] to their absence or poor condition... (See photographs 18 through 22 under Infrastructure and Drainage, Annex 6.)931\n\nExhibits E-266, *Auditor\u00eda Ambiental Bloque 7 - 2002, Perenco Ecuador Limited,* December 2002; E-267, \" *Auditor\u00eda Ambiental del Bloque 21*,\" prepared by *Eficiencia Energ\u00e9tica y Ambiental Eficacitas Consultora C\u00eda.* for Perenco, dated December 2002.\n\nExhibit E-266, *Auditor\u00eda Ambiental Bloque 7 - 2002, Perenco Ecuador Limited,* December 2002, pp 58-59.\n\nExhibit E-266, *Auditor\u00eda Ambiental Bloque 7 - 2002, Perenco Ecuador Limited,* December 2002, p 79. [Emphasis added.]\n\n403.\n\nIn terms of waste management, in general there was \"conformity with environment management of solid and liquid waste in most Fields\", but there was a \"major nonconformity in Oso Field, Oso 1 platform because there is not an appropriate disposal of solid waste, let alone of liquid waste (black and gray waters) which are directly discharged to the neighboring estuary (see Photographs 1, 6 to 12, Waste Management, Annex 6.).\"932 The evaluation matrix at the end of the Block 7 Audit listed major non-conformities only for \"retention\" in the \"Payamino Sector\" and otherwise the Block was described as \"in conformity\" with applicable regulations with a few \"low nonconformities\" listed in the matrix.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n404.\n\nAs for Block 21, as Ecuador has correctly noted, the 2002 audit \"did not record a single site as being contaminated.\"933 Perenco did not take issue with this assertion in its Reply PostHearing Brief.\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 45.\n\n**(13) Conclusion on the State of the Blocks at the Time of Their Acquisition**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the record evidence indicates some problems with the Coca-Payamino Field and the Oso 1 platform which predated Perenco's operatorship934, but otherwise, the PSA's disclosures and the 2002 Audit do not suggest major environmental problems.\n\nSee Exhibit CE-CC-51, Letter of January 28, 2003 from Perenco to DINAPA, attaching the Remediation Program for Block 7, including Coca-Payamino field, PER\\_CC0002831. It refers to a letter dated 28 January 2003 (i.e., just after Perenco commenced operations) which referred to a DINAPA letter of 22 January 2003 requesting the submission of a remediation programme for contaminated areas in Block 7, including the Coca-Payomina Field. Perenco's letter noted that the \"material requiring remediation is that resulting from recollecting hydrocarbon-contaminated soils from several Block 7 sites including the Coca-Payomina field.\"\n\n**(14) Observations on Perenco's Environmental Management Practices in Blocks 7 and 21**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it necessary to set out some observations on the way in which Perenco conducted itself in relation to these Blocks under Ecuadorian environmental laws. Perenco has held itself out as having been a \"responsible manager that focused on, preserved, and even improved the environmental and infrastructural integrity of the Blocks.\"935 On the basis of certain contemporaneous documents, some of Perenco's own making, as well as witness testimony, the Tribunal is not convinced of this assertion. For example, a \"Health, Safety, Environment and Sustainable Development Assessment\" performed by ConocoPhillips in October 2006 (in relation to its acquisition of Burlington), noted that Perenco \"does not have an HSE [Health, Safety Environment] management system in place\" although it was \"currently in the process of developing one.\"936 This observation was made *four years* after Perenco started operating the Blocks.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 2, 4-6; Rejoinder, paragraphs 2, 289-297.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-126, HSE & SD Assessment and Other Technical Services, Assets in Ecuador, Report prepared by ERM for Conoco-Phillips, dated November 2006, PER\\_CC0004420.\n\n407.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's view of Perenco's conduct, as discussed further below, it has decided not to dispose of this claim on a simple burden of proof approach.\n\n408.\n\nThe Tribunal also accepts Ecuador's submission that it might be difficult to have an accurate picture of the environmental condition of oil blocks situated in a rapidly changing environment such as the Amazonian rainforest. The combined effect of the hot, humid climate and rapid growth of vegetation of the Amazonian rainforest zone is of such a nature as to quickly obscure spills. Indeed, the point was made by Perenco's Mr. Saltos, who observed:\n\nIn one month, a whole area could be revegetated, even though the area was deforested. There is so much rain, so much humidity, that, well, plants proliferate. We've had many cases, and oftentimes this has happened, that areas that were impaired by a spill, well, you go there the next month, and there are no vestiges of it [sic] this spill. You can be walking over this spill and not realize there was a spill.937\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, p 1514 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos) [Emphasis added.].\n\n409.\n\nThis is the view of a representative of the operator who - unlike the environmental authorities - was closer to the day-to-day operations in the oilfield and therefore comparatively more knowledgeable as to the occurrence and extent of spills and other forms of contamination. The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that the fact that rapid growth of vegetation might obscure a visual inspection of contaminants, does not mean that they disappear for remediation purposes.938 Hence, while as GSI emphasised, visual inspections are an important part of conducting a thorough assessment, they are hardly adequate to the task of ascertaining the extent of contamination and the Tribunal is not content to rely upon an expert's visual evaluation.\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 11. Ecuador argues further that \"a significant number of the samples showing exceedances were found at depths of one meter or more. Obviously, contamination at the subsurface depths [is] not readily apparent.\"\n\n410.\n\nPerenco failed in its duty to conduct the 2004 audit, with the result that there was a gap in environmental monitoring from 2002 to 2006. The 2006 audits showed an increase in non-conformities, which counsel for Ecuador characterised as \"a fairly bleak picture of Perenco's first four years of operations contrary to the impression Perenco has sought to convey in this arbitration.\"939 Ecuador asserted that the 2006 audits show that, contrary to Perenco's submission, the increase in incidence of contamination occurred after the year 2000.940 Perenco took exception to this characterisation, responding that: \".the 2006 audit revealed no major problems and was approved.\"941\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 124-126 (Opening Statement of Philip Dunham).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 122-123 (Opening Statement of Philip Dunham). This position is taken in the alternative, Ecuador's primarily proceeding on the basis that the audits commissioned by the Consortium in 2000, 2006 and 2008 were inadequate because of the small number of samples examined: Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 123-124 (Opening Statement of Philip Dunham) (\".if you add up the totality of the soil samples taken for auditing purposes between 2002 and 2008, the total amounts to 29 soil samples only.\"). See also, Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 126 (Opening Statement of Philip Dunham) \".out of a total of 29 soil and pit leachate samples taken for the 2006 audit\u2014audits, one finds nine nonconforming results. This is a significant failure rate of some 30 percent.\" Perenco relies on, amongst other things, the 2008 audits which it submits revealed general compliance with only minor regulatory deviations. Ecuador challenges reliance on this audit because it was rejected by Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment as not representative of the condition of the Blocks, and because it is significant that Mr. Puente (former employee who worked on \"community relations within Block 7\") who provided evidence of the limited scope of the audit and that it avoided some contaminated areas) was not called to testify at the hearing in The Hague. (Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 128-129).\n\nPerenco's Reply Post-Hearing Brief paragraph 26.\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that RPS's third expert report contains a comprehensive summary of the 2006 and 2008 audits. The number of non-conformities, including major non-conformities, is striking and tends to weaken Perenco's claim of strong environmental stewardship. The Tribunal considers it helpful to summarise RPS's findings (in a somewhat summary fashion) because they are quite thorough.\n\na) Failure to Conduct Biennial Environmental Audits942\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nRPS ER III, section 6.1.\n\n412.\n\nIt has already been noted that a biennial environmental audit was not conducted in either Block 7 (including CPUF) or Block 21 in 2004. This was recorded in the 2006 audits.\n\n413.\n\nExcerpts of Ecuambiente's November 2006 environmental audit findings noted the lack of 2004 biennial audits:\n\n**2006 Block 7 Audit**... \"Environmental Audit of Block 7,\" prepared by Ecuambiente Consulting Group (November 2006) for Perenco Ecuador, Limited: Ecuambiente stated that the last environmental audit was in 2002 (Finding 47 - *Nonconformance* : No biennial audit in 2004 for Block 7 activities.). The auditor compared findings from the November 2006 audit with the 2002 audit and listed six areas of repeated noncompliance, two of which included management of drainage and contaminated soil management.\n\n**2006 Block 21 Audit**... \"Environmental Audit of Block 21\" prepared by Ecuambiente Consulting Group (January 2007 and 2007a) for Perenco Ecuador Limited: Finding No. 42 - *Nonconformance* : Biennial audit was not conducted in 2004 for Block 21.\n\nb) Lack of Environmental Management Plan *(Plan de Manejo Ambiental)* *'* *943*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRPS ER III, section 6.2.1.\n\n414.\n\nRPS described a \"vital component\" of the audit process as evaluating compliance/conformance not only with applicable environmental regulations but also with the (facility's or site's) Environmental Management Plan. An Environmental Management Plan is used in tandem with an Environmental Impact Study and Monitoring Plan to control and mitigate impacts that could have a deleterious effect on the environment. RAOHE, Article 41, Section 7A describes the components of the Environmental Management Plan. RPS noted that GSI acknowledged the importance of the Environmental Management Plan in their first expert report.944\n\nGSI ER I, Section 5.3.7, paragraphs 205 and 206, pp 82-83.\n\n415.\n\nThe auditor, Ecuambiente, noted the lack of an Environmental Management Plan for Block 7 in 2006. The Consortium sought to minimise the significance of this in a letter to the Undersecretary of Environmental Protection (SPA) within the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum. The SPA responded stating that this was a serious breach of RAOHE.\n\n**2006 Block 7 Audit.** Finding 30 - *Nonconformance* : No Management Plan (*Plan de Manejo*) establishing control criteria for development and operations phase in Block 7. No updated, documented procedures. Obsolete procedures are maintained (Oryx Manuals, HSE manual dated November 1997, procedures in English).945\n\nSee also, correspondence between General Manager of the Consortium and SPA dated 19 September 2007 (Oficio No. 645-SPA-DINAPA-CDS): \"With respect to your affirmation that the inexistence of an environmental management Plan for Campo Coca Payamino and Block 7 consists in a slight noncompliance of management plans and applicable laws according to the applicable scheme of minor non-conformances, I inform you that this Department considers the finding a serious breach of the Environmental Regulation for Petroleum Operations in Ecuador and must be categorized as a Major Nonconformance.\" (As quoted at RPS ER III, p 88).\n\nc) Lack of Environmental Licence\n--------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe Environmental Management Law (*Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental*), Article 20 (1999) states, \"For the initiation of all activities that pose an environmental risk, one must have the license granted by the corresponding Ministry.\" The requirement for Environmental Licences is stipulated in TULAS Book VI Articles 3, 18, and 25. In the 2008 environmental audits for Blocks 7 and 21, the following was noted::\n\n**2008 Block 7 Audit**... Observation 6: Coca-Payamino, Jaguar, Mono, and Gacela fields lack environmental licenses in accordance with the legal requirement.\n\n**2008 Block 21 Audit**... Consortium correspondence (*Oficio* : PER-1350-07) dated 17 December 2007 to the Subsecretary of Environmental Protection (SPA) requesting a prompt response from the government because the Consortium needed to submit paperwork in order to obtain Environmental Licenses. (Abrus 2008, page 264 of 510).\n\nd) Outdated Environmental Impact Study946\n-----------------------------------------\n\nRPS ER III, section 6.2.3.\n\n417.\n\nThe audit noted that when requested to produce an Environmental Impact Study for the CPUF, the Consortium relied on an outdated EIS that was prepared by another operator some 14 years earlier:\n\nAn excerpt from one of the Consortium's internal weekly reports, Perenco Ecuador Limited Weekly Report, Period Covering: April 7 through 13, 2007, Section 2 Q.H.S.E. (Perenco Ecuador Limited 2007 - PERPROD0007596, page 2 of 6) follows: \"DINAPA made a petition with penalty regarding the non-submission of EIS Coca-Payamino Field. Perenco responded with the copy of the EIS presented in year 1993 and submitted a communication regarding the no application (sic) of the penalty.\n\ne) Irregularities in Management of Drill Cuttings and Mud Pits947\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRPS ER III, section 6.3\n\n418.\n\nRPS noted that the audits found irregularities in mud pit management in Block 7 and Block 21 in 2006 and in 2008:\n\n**2006 Block 7 Audit** : Section 4.4.5 \"Table 4-15 Monitoring Results of Drill Cuttings in Pits in Block 7\" (Ecuambiente 2006) contains two tables:-\n\n1. Table 4-15 Pits with Impermeable Base (page 51): It compared the results of a sampling event conducted during the audit at Coca 18-19 with RAOHE Table 7b (i.e., pit with impermeable base or liner) and did not show exceedances in the analytical results.\n\n2. Table 4-15 Pits Without Impermeable Base (page 52): It showed exceedances in leachate concentrations at three sites (Oso 3-RLP, Lobo 3 Taladro and Jaguar 9)\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Parameter** | **Maximum Permissible Limits RAOHE Table 7a (i.e.. Pit** ***Without*** **Impermeable Base or Liner)** | **Audit Sample Results** |\n| **Oso 3-RLP** | **Lobo 3 Taladro** | **Jaguar 9** |\n| **PH** | **6 - 9** | **5.52** | **11.98** | **5.4** |\n| **Electrical Conductivity (uS/cm)** | **4000** |  | **4320** |  |\n\n**2008 Block 7 Audit:** Closed mud pit does not conform with grade (accumulation of water) ( Observation 15).\n\n**2006 Block 21 Audit** : Monitoring of soil quality in drilling mud pits was not performed in a timely manner (6 of 16 pits without complete monitoring). Monitoring that was complete (at time of audit) was within regulatory limits (Finding 12). Areas where drill cuttings and drilling mud are treated lack appropriate surface drainage systems (Finding 19). Platform soil where mud treatment pits are located is not reconformed [sic] (presumably not regraded) to similar conditions as the rest of the platform (Finding 20). Use of area for Perenco activities [auxiliary covering [sic] (presumably capping or closure) of drilling mud and drill cuttings] without authorization (Finding 28). Lack of revegetation/reforestation of areas used for drilling muds (Finding 48).\n\n**2008 Block 21 Audit** : As of 31 October, there is no impact evaluation or management plan for mud pits. This will be a nonconformance in the audit if it is not presented before the indicated date (Abrus 2008, page 7-2, pdf page 153 of 510, Observation No. 2).\n\nf) Irregularities in Wastewater Treatment and Impact to Receiving Bodies948\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRPS ER III, section 6.4.\n\n419.\n\nThe audits noted that RAOHE Table 4 requires liquid discharges to comply with the maximum permissible limits at two control points:\n\n1. RAOHE Annex 2, Table 4a: Wastewater discharge control point; and\n\n2. RAOHE Annex 2, Table 4b: Receiving body (e.g., creek) immission point. The term immission point is the point the discharge enters the creek or receiving body.\n\n420.\n\nExamples of inadequately treated wastewater were identified during the environmental audits:949\n\nIn 2002, untreated waters from grease and oil traps were discharged directly to a seasonal creek. The auditor defined \"grey waters\" (*aguas grises*) as wastewaters conveyed to grease and oil traps and discharged directly to the soil.950\n\n**2002 audit** : The drainage systems (ditches, secondary containment) are inefficient and do not comply with what is stipulated in the environmental impact study and RAOHE. Major nonconformance in Oso 1 platform (\"Adequate disposal of solid waste does not exist and even worse is liquid waste (sewage and grey waters),\" which is directly discharged to the adjacent *estero* (i.e., seasonal creek).\n\nThe **2006 Block 7 audit** compared the analytical results of samples collected during the audit with the regulatory limits established in RAOHE, Annex 2 Table 4a. It showed exceedances at the process wastewater discharge control point (Table 4a) at three sites:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Coca Payamino Mechanical API** **Parameter** | **Maximum Permissible Limits** | **Audit** **Sample** **Results** |\n| **RAOHE Table 4a** | **TULAS, Book VI, Annex 1, Table 12** |\n| Barium (mg/L) | **<5** | <2 | **3,047** |\n| Total Solids (mg/L) | < 1700 | < 1600 | **4396** |\n| Chemical Oxygen Demand (mg/L) | < 120 | <250 | **750** |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Gacela CPF API |\n| **Parameter** Total Solids (mg/L) | **Maximum Permissible Limits** | **Audit** **Sample** **Results** **19140** |\n| **RAOHE Table 4a**< 1700 | **TULAS, Book VI, Annex 1, Table 12**<1600 |\n| Lobo 7 | **Maximum** | **Permissible Limits** | **Audit** |\n| **Parameter** | **RAOHE Table 4a** | **TULAS, Book VI, Annex 1, Table 12** | **Sample** **Results** |\n| Total Solids (mg/L) | < 1700 | < 1600 | **5028** |\n| Electrical Conductivity (pS/cm) | < 2500 | Not Listed | **6840** |\n\nThe 2006 Block 7 audit also noted that \"Perenco's activities\" may result in the \"possibility of impacting groundwater by injection of saline waters and sanitary wastewater (i.e., sewage) in old injection wells that do not have environmental studies, in accordance with RAOHE.\" It recommended that \"Perenco must establish geologic studies that ensure injection of formation waters and sewage in old wells (Payamino 3, Punino, Jaguar CPF, Mono 12) do not provoke environmental risk.\"\n\nThe 2006 Block 21 audit observed inadequate \"grease traps\", identified the nonconformity that natural drainage was not respected when constructing a \"grease trap\" over an *estero* at control point 2, and observed noncompliance of maximum permissible limit for the parameter, barium, in internal monitoring of API discharge in March 2006 (subsequent monitoring found that the condition had been corrected).\n\nRPS ER III, section 6.4.1.\n\nRPS ER III, section 6.4.1.\n\n421.\n\nRPS cited examples where the Consortium's auditors noted that the water quality of receiving bodies, such as creeks, was negatively affected by inadequately treated wastewater and/or by polluted storm water runoff.951 The concentrations exceeded the maximum permissible limits in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 4b.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 2006 Block 7 Audit |\n| Coca CPF | **Audit** **Sample** **Results** |\n| **Parameter** | **Maximum Permissible Limits RAOHE TULAS, Book VI,** **Table 4b Annex 1, Table 3** |\n| TPH (mg/kg) | <0.5 <0.5 | **1** |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Coca 7** |\n| **Parameter** Electrical Conductivity (uS/cm) | **Maximum Permissible Limits** | **Audit** **Sample** **Results** **442** |\n| **RAOHE Table 4b**< 170 | **TULAS, Book VI, Annex 1, Table 3** Not Listed |\n| **Payamino 15** | **Maximum** | **Permissible Limits** | **Audit** |\n| **Parameter** | **RAOHE** | **TULAS, Book VI,** | **Sample** |\n|  | **Table 4b** | **Annex 1, Table 3** | **Results** |\n| Chemical Oxygen Demand (mg/L) | <30 | Not Listed | **50** |\n\nRPS ER III, section 6.4.2.\n\ng) Audit Findings - Contaminated Soils952\n-----------------------------------------\n\nRPS ER III, section 6.5.1.\n\n422.\n\nRPS noted that in 2002, the Consortium's auditor, *Effic\u00e1citas*, concluded that improper treatment of contaminated soils had a direct impact on the environment.\n\n**2002 Block 7 Audit** : \"The management and treatment of contaminated soils is partial and produces direct impacts.\"\n\n423.\n\nSoil samples collected during the 2006 audit by Ecuambiente showed concentrations of cadmium and lead above the maximum permissible limits in the regulations.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **2006 Block 7 Audit** : |\n|  | **Maximum** | **Permissible Limits** | **Audit Sample Results** |\n| **Parameter** | **RAOHE Table 6** | **TULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Table 2** | **Coca 13** | **Payamino** **Sanitary** **Landfill** |\n| Cadmium (mg/kg) | <2 | <0.5 | **0.51** |  |\n| Lead (mg/kg) | < 100 | <25 |  | **33.61** |\n\nh) Irregular Waste Management and Chemical Management953\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nRPS ER III, section 6.6\n\n**2002 Block 7 Audit** : The management of the Payamino Sanitary Landfill only partially complied with what is stipulated in RAOHE and the EIA (i.e., environmental impact study). It identified a major non conformance in the inadequacy of the disposal of contaminated soils within the Landfill, and a minor nonconformance in the storage of chemical containers which were exposed to inclement weather.\n\n**2006 Block 7 Audit** : The auditor noted that hazardous waste was stored directly on the soil (finding 37). It cites Photo PA.45, which was not included in Annex B of the 2006 report provided for review. In general, storage of hazardous waste directly on soil over multiple years and exposed to inclement weather will exacerbate contamination.\n\n**2008 Block 7 Audit** : The auditor identified a minor nonconformance in that soil disposed in the Landfill lacked containment to prevent migration of hydrocarbons (finding 11).\n\n**2006 Block 21 Audit** : Lack of secondary containment or lack of retention valve for chemical and fuel tank or equipment (finding 10). A nonconformity in hazardous waste (batteries, chemical product containers) being given to the organization, La Selva, who is not permitted to treat this type of waste (finding 31). Auditor identified that chemical products were found in storm water drainage and outside of drainage trench (finding 36), and chemical products not protected from rain (finding 38).\n\n**2008 Block 21 Audit** : Chemical storage containment for Pad A and CPF have openings and plants growing in them. The containment lacks integrity in the event of a spill (finding 2).\n\n424.\n\nIn sum, the audits did not, in the Tribunal's view, resoundingly endorse Perenco's operatorship.\n\n425.\n\nIn its reply expert report, in response to RPS's summary of the audits' findings, GSI sought to downplay the audits' significance. It asserted firstly that, \"environmental audits are not intended to prove that the operations are flawless, but, rather, serve to facilitate the continuous improvement of the operations with regard to environmental, health, and safety concerns\"954, the implication that the process of complying with environmental regulations is an on-going work in progress.\n\nGSI ER II, paragraph 188.\n\n426.\n\nGSI then devoted three paragraphs to the audits, which the Tribunal quotes in full:\n\n190. The biennial audits completed for the Consortium operations did not identify significant impacts to soil, and minor issues of this nature were subsequently resolved. In addition, none of the biennial audits reported groundwater impacts. In sum, these audit findings do not support the current claims by IEMS of extensive damage to soil and groundwater.\n\n191. The biennial audits do identify other issues that are unrelated to soil or groundwater impacts. Many of the issues listed by RPS are administrative in nature, such as the absence of a required document or license. In addition, RPS discusses \"irregularities\" in the management of drill cuttings and mud pits, which generally reflect minor excursions of monitoring parameters such as pH and electrical conductance, or failure to perform testing within a specific timeframe. However, none of the audit findings identified by RPS are related to any specific claim of environmental damage now alleged by Ecuador.\n\n192. RPS also discusses soil impacts within the Payamino field, particularly at the locations of Payamino 02 y 08 and Payamino CPF.\n\nThese sites have been thoroughly investigated by IEMS and GSI, and our findings regarding environmental impacts and related remediation costs are discussed in detail in this report and our prior report. As discussed in Section 5 of this report, the soil impacts delineated at these and other sites are principally related to operations prior to 1990, and are therefore unrelated to Consortium operations after 2002.955\n\nGSI ER II, paragraphs 190-192.\n\n427.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this does not adequately respond to the list of nonconformities found by the audits and summarised by RPS. Contrary to the description of many of the issues as being \"administrative in nature\", as the list of non-conformities shows, in addition to irregularities in treating and confining contaminated soils, wastewater treatment, monitoring and ensuring proper grading for mud pits and the like, there were basic failings such as: (i) failing to even conduct an audit in 2004; (ii) not having the Environmental Management Plan required by RAOHE for the Payamino Camp and Block 7 at all and instead relying on Oryx's outdated November 1997 plan;956 (iii) using an Environmental Impact Study for the Coca-Payamino Field that was prepared by Oryx years before;957 (iv) not having the Environmental Licences required by the Environmental Management Law and TULAS Book VI Articles 3, 18, and 25 for certain fields in the Blocks.\n\nGSI in its first expert report noted, at paragraph 19, that an Environmental Impact Study (EIS), an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and a Monitoring Plan is required for every oilfield development project: \"As specified under the Ecuador [RAOHE] regulation, effective since February 2001, for every oilfield development project, an Environmental Impact Study (EIS), an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and a Monitoring Plan are required to assess the potential risks posed to the environment and design and implement measures to mitigate such risks. In practical terms, environmental management for the oilfield industry entails minimizing the footprint of the oilfield facilities; controlling and containing the materials used and generated during drilling and production operations (mud/ cuttings, crude oil, produced water); and implementing effective response actions if and when spills of these materials do occur. Specific considerations regarding the use of earthen pits, oil spill prevention and response, and the use of gas flares, which are relevant to certain allegations made by IEMS or the Republic of Ecuador in this case, are addressed in further detail below.\"\n\nAs RPS noted in its third expert report, at paragraph 6.2.3.\n\n428.\n\nAs for GSI's attempt to minimise the contamination issues identified in the audits and its contention that the \"biennial audits do identify other issues that are unrelated to soil or groundwater impacts\", this takes the Tribunal to a third and related point in connection to the biennial audits. The Tribunal is not convinced that the issues identified were \"minor.\" The entire system relies upon compliance with licencing obligations, full and timely reporting, and the retention of independent auditors in order to conduct thorough audits. The system assumes that the operator will work with the auditing company in good faith to objectively report the environmental condition of the Blocks in their entirety.\n\n429.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal was struck by the evidence of one witness who provided a written statement for Ecuador, but who was not called for cross-examination by Perenco. Mr. Marco Puente was a former Perenco employee responsible for Community Relations in the northern section of Block 7 where the Coca-Payamino, Gacela and Lobo fields are located.958 Mr. Puente testified as to certain commitments made by Perenco to the local communities, which are not relevant for present purposes, but more importantly, he testified that:\n\nAs Block 7 Community Relations liaison, I intervened as a negotiator or intermediary with the operator whenever complaints against Perenco arose from the residents. Most complaints were related to damages to the natural environment (whether spills of crude or water formations, overflow of sludge ponds, etc.) or damages caused to local populations (for example, we received complaints about noise in those areas with homes close to the platforms as well as complaints regarding damages to crops). The Coca, Gacela and Payamino fields were the most problematic in this regard.959\n\nWitness Statement of Marco Puente, paragraph 4.\n\nWitness Statement of Marco Puente, paragraph 14.\n\n430.\n\nWhen such incidents occurred, he testified, Perenco would negotiate agreements with the affected local inhabitants. However:\n\nWhile in many cases, agreements were reached, the communities complained to Perenco that an adequate and full environmental remediation was not made. The communities often complained that the cleaning of contaminated areas was highly superficial and did not completely eliminate the contamination... I recall, for example, that we received a complaint in 2008 regarding the spill of water formation (very corrosive water produced alongside with crude oil) in a swamp near the Lobo 3 well. We reached an agreement with about 7 owners of affected areas but not any remediation of the contaminated water was made. In another case, an oil spill occurred from Payamino 1 into River A\u00f1ango and the river was never cleaned because Perenco declared that the material falling into the river consisted of leaching debris from the coffee fields, even though the Community Relations liaison was present when the spill occurred and confirmed that such spill consisted of crude indeed.960\n\nWitness Statement of Marco Puente, paragraph 17 [Emphasis added.].\n\n431.\n\nMr. Puente also testified as to how the 2008 biennial audit for Block 7, which took place when he was in the Block, was conducted. As the Community Relations liaison, his role \"was to contact the communities where the auditors should go to collect samples, to inform them of what was to occur and request permission for the auditors to enter areas of their property.\" He testified further:\n\nAs I recall, the Block 7 audit did not last for more than a week and very few people, from a private Ecuadorian consultant hired by Perenco, intervened. Given the great extension of Block 7 and the few mobilized personnel, the scope of the audit was very limited. The auditors were only able to review certain sites where Perenco employees had expressly taken them and which had been previously cleaned, to verify, in particular, the fulfillment of a previous audit conducted in 2006. In addition, auditors arrived with very simple equipment which only allowed them to take samples at a depth of between 50 and 60 cm. This depth is insufficient to detect all the possible contamination by hydrocarbons... I do not recall that they were taken to sites where highly contaminated areas had been detected.961\n\nWitness statement of Marco Puente, paragraph 19 [Emphasis added.].\n\n432.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr. Puente's testimony is consistent with IEMS' critique of the 2008 Block 7 audit. IEMS noted that only 12 sites were sampled by the auditors and only 1 sample was taken at each site, except for Coca CPF, where 2 samples were taken.962 IEMS asserted further that the sampling evidently did not take place at different depths, but rather close to the ground surface.963 In such circumstances, it is unsurprising that GSI asserted that the audits \"did not identify significant impacts to soil, and minor issues of this nature were subsequently resolved.\"964\n\nAnnex P to IEMS ER II at pp 2-3: \"In relation to the quantity of samples, the auditors of Perenco collected only 13 samples to evaluate the operations in an area of 2,033,000.000 square meters. This means that each sample represented an area of approximately 156,000,000 square meters. Even if it is true that, through the use of some criteria, the studied areas should be reduced and focused exclusively on those areas with potential contamination, such criteria are not explained in the report examined. Moreover, the fact that 13 samples were taken in an area with operations presenting a high risk of impact to soil in 62 sites, and with a large number of complaints presented by the residents of the areas, is, obviously, an insufficient process. In addition, the criteria that were used for the location of soil samples are not explained. Therefore, it is not clear if these samples were aimed at detecting contamination.\"\n\nAnnex P to IEMS ER II at p 3: \"In regards to the quality of the samples, the 13 soil samples were taken by the auditors of Perenco in a superficial manner. This is so, notwithstanding the fact that these complaints from residents of the area near the contaminated soil which is buried and covered with layers of non-contaminated soil, according to the information obtained by IEMS. Therefore, the sampling process should have included samples at different depths. For this reason, IEMS investigation has included, precisely, samples at different depths (up to depths superior to 5 meters). As the auditors of Perenco collected the samples from the surface, they did not detect the contamination covered with layers of non-contaminated soil, as they only studied the layer of clean soil. This situation does not demonstrate an intention to evaluate these areas claimed as contaminated by the residents of the communities within Block 7.\"  \n In this respect, the auditor's shallow soil sampling echoes GSI's sampling techniques in the present arbitration; RPS noted that while IEMS collected samples at up to depths of 5.5 metres, GSI limited their investigation of surface soils to 0.3 metres below ground surface. RPS ER III, p 8, \"The results for the risk characterization samples are not expected to be representative of the concentrations of chemicals in contaminated soils, and do not correctly represent the potential for exposure, since only 1) surface soils 0 to 0.3 meters below ground surface were collected, while RBCA [Risk-Based Corrective Action] protocol for surface soils is 0 to 1.0 meters below ground surface...\" and p 50, where the point is repeated.\n\nGSI ER II, paragraph 190.\n\n433.\n\nMr. Puente's testimony was not directly challenged by Perenco and it is troubling. If it is to be credited - and there is no reason to doubt it - the 2008 audit must be viewed with skepticism.\n\n434.\n\nThis takes the Tribunal to a consideration of Perenco's attitude as operator. In addition to Mr. Puente's testimony, the Tribunal was directed to certain documents that portray a disquieting approach to dealing with incidents of contamination.\n\n435.\n\nThe first document which has given the Tribunal pause is a memorandum of May 2010 prepared by Perenco regarding the characterisation of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8. It concerned an area of soil saturated with crude oil to an average depth of 80 cm and covering approximately half a hectare. The document acknowledged that this was \"contamination caused by crude oil for which it is not been possible to establish the exact date of occurrence\" but which Perenco assumed occurred prior to its operations (\"assuming that it must have occurred during the time of the operations of the State Oil Company Petroproproducci\u00f3n (1997-2000)\").965 The contamination was discovered by the owner of the lands, Mr. Daniel Jungal, when he was hunting.966\n\nExhibit E-170, Memorandum prepared by Perenco on the characterization of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8 (*Caracterizaci\u00f3n de Pendientes Ambientales Payamino 2-8*) dated May 2010, p 1.\n\nExhibit E-170, Memorandum prepared by Perenco on the characterization of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8 (*Caracterizaci\u00f3n de Pendientes Ambientales Payamino 2-8*) dated May 2010, p 1.\n\n436.\n\nThe memorandum recounted the fact that the \"knowledge of the existence of this issue is limited to the following people and organizations\":\n\nPERENCO-QUITO: we know the true extent of the problem\n\nDANIEL JUNGAL - Owner: knows exactly the extent and impacts of the problem, as well as the consequences and effects of its spreading out\n\nPETROAMAZONAS-MANAGEMENT QSHE-DEPARTMENT\n\nBLOCK 7: only knows of the existence of \u2018contamination behind the Payamino 2-8 platform' but does not know the exact location nor of its extent\n\nOMBUDSMAN - DIOCLES ZAMBRANA: knows the exact location of the problem, but not its true extent\n\nVENCEDORES - ZIGIFREDO CEVALLOS: knows that the environmental damage exists and that it is near Payamino 2-8 but not the exact place nor extent.967\n\nExhibit E-170, Memorandum prepared by Perenco on the characterization of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8 (*Caracterizaci\u00f3n de Pendientes Ambientales Payamino 2-8*) dated May 2010, p 2.\n\n437.\n\nThe memorandum noted further that Mr. Jungal had \"orally offered not to allow claimants or judicial officers to access his land, *at least where we consider that it is not in our interest that it be visited*.\"968 Even accounting for the fact that at the time of its writing Perenco and Ecuador were locked in the current adversarial process, this is a disquieting statement.\n\nExhibit E-170, Memorandum prepared by Perenco on the characterization of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8 (*Caracterizaci\u00f3n de Pendientes Ambientales Payamino 2-8*) dated May 2010, p 2 [Emphasis added.].\n\n438.\n\nThe memorandum then set out \"possible solutions\" to the problem including, \"conventional remediation\" of the location, \"confine the problem and justify leaving the area as it is\", \"dismiss the issue\" (which it was noted could lead to a lawsuit and \"multimillion dollars compensation\" as well as lead the State to \"force us to remedy the site under their conditions\" in a situation where \"the cost will reach amounts very difficult to estimate now\" and \"the reputational cost to Perenco will also be very high\").969\n\nExhibit E-170, Memorandum prepared by Perenco on the characterization of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8 (*Caracterizaci\u00f3n de Pendientes Ambientales Payamino 2-8*) dated May 2010, pp 2-4.\n\n439.\n\nThe final passage of the Memorandum which is relevant for present purposes noted:\n\n\" The State will probably assume that we are hiding many more [environmental] damages and will scrutinize the operations area in search for more damages and it will probably find them.\"970\n\nExhibit E-170, Memorandum prepared by Perenco on the characterization of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8 (*Caracterizaci\u00f3n de Pendientes Ambientales Payamino 2-8*) dated May 2010, p 4 [Emphasis added.].\n\n440.\n\nPerenco settled with Mr. Jungal without admitting liability. Only after it was notified on 22 May 2010 by a Civil Judge from Pinchincha that there would be a judicial inspection on 11 June 2010 did it inform the Minister of Environment of the contamination by letter of the same date. In the letter, it attributed the damage to a prior operator and disclaimed any responsibility for any of the damages and remedial costs arising from the event.971\n\nExhibit E-161, Letter from Perenco to the Minister of Environment dated 11 June 2010. The confidential settlement agreement was concluded between Perenco and Mr. Jungal and Ms. Nancy Cecelia Cardenas Hernandez on 11 May 2010 (Exhibit CE-CC-235, Settlement Agreement with Jose Daniel Jungal, May 11, 2010 (*Confidential*), PER\\_CC007439). The settlement agreement records the statement that: \"An inspection was done by a company expert, and everything indicates that the most important impacts occurred more than 10 years ago, that is to say, they occurred when Perenco was not the operator.\" A further recital recorded that Perenco \"as an act of good faith agrees to enter into this agreement in order to end all controversies that have arisen between the Parties to cover all of these years.\" There were prior complaints made by Mr Jungal. Annex E to IEMS ER II, contains minutes of a meeting held on 15 September 2005 between the Ombudsman Office of Orellana and Mr. Jungal and Dr. Gabriella Rumazo representing Perenco along with Engineer David Trujullo. Exhibit E-269 (\" *Informe de inspecci\u00f3n N\u00b0 07-07, H. Consejo Provincial de Orellana - Departamento del Ambiente,\"\"* dated 10 April 2007) is a report of an inspection of Mr. Jungal's farm conducted by the Orellana Department of the Environment on 10 April 2007.\n\n441.\n\nPrior to informing the Ministry of the contamination, however, Perenco retained a laboratory to take samples with a view to determining when the spill occurred. As Ecuador noted in its Counter-Memorial on Liability and the Counterclaims:\n\nPerenco sent several samples, taken by its own employee, Mr. Wilfrido Saltos, to be analyzed by a laboratory named Gr\u00fcntech.972 On 2 June 2010, this laboratory concluded that the sample received was highly contaminated with hydrocarbons and estimated that the contamination occurred 4 to 7 years earlier, *i.e.*, during the time Perenco was acting as operator.973\n\nExhibits E-171, Gr\u00fcntech's Analysis Report dated 2 June 2010; E-161, Letter from Perenco to the Minister of Environment dated 11 June 2010\n\nEcuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 745.\n\n442.\n\nThe laboratory's finding, which it noted was not conclusive, was inconsistent with Perenco's contention that the contamination predated its involvement in the Blocks. When writing to the Ministry eight days later, however, and without adverting to Gr\u00fcntech's findings, Perenco maintained its position that someone else was responsible for this major spill without disclosing the possibility that Perenco itself might be:974\n\n\"In effect, the spill seems to have been caused by prior events not solely to the [sic] presence of Perenco and Kerr McGee in Block 7 and the Coca Payamino field, but also to the execution of the Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 7 of the Amazon Region and the Unified Coca-Payamino Field (\"Block 7 Contract\"). CEPE - The Ecuadorian State Oil Corporation (which years later was replaced by Petroecuador and recently by EP PETROECUADOR) drilled Payamino well number 2 in 1987; and Oryx Ecuador Energy Company drilled Payamino well number 8 in 1992.\n\nThese facts strongly suggest that the alleged environmental incident, if existed, occurred prior to Perenco or its predecessors having any kind of control over the Payamino 2 and 8 wells. Consequently, Perenco is not responsible for any of the damages or remedial costs arising from any leakage from the Coca-Payamino field.\"975\n\nThere is conflicting evidence on this point. Exhibit E-269 is a report of an inspection of Mr. Jungal's farm conducted by the Orellana Department of the Environment on 10 April 2007. Among other areas, the inspection looked at the Payamino 4, 2-8, 20-24-14, 18 and 22 platforms. It found, \"On the #02-08 platform (point 4) and to the side of it, a large area of approximately 20,000 m2 was found containing crude oil residues in large quantities.\" During his cross-examination, Mr. Saltos stated that he was unaware of this inspection report until it was entered into the record of the arbitration. Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1517-1518 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos). The transcript then records the following exchange between counsel and Mr. Saltos:  \n Q. But according to this inspection, sir, in April 2007, crude could still be found on the platform itself; correct?  \n A. Well, in the platform itself, there must have been--or there could have been crude oil because this is an operational platform and occasionally there are some sprays--there is some spraying or there is the spreading of hydrocarbons or diesel. So, certainly there must have been some on the platform.  \nQ. Well, sir, this delegation goes to the platform in April 2007 and finds both on the platform and to the side of it some 20,000 cubic meters\u2014square meters, sorry, of contamination, and you were not aware, Perenco was not aware, had not observed this contamination. That is your testimony, sir; correct?  \n A. That's correct. This Report that was drafted there was not made aware to me, and I wasn't aware of it. And in addition to that, we are not aware of the conditions under which the samples were taken or what samples were taken. We don't know.  \n Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1519-1520 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos).  \n After receiving the results of the Gr\u00fcntech report, in October 2010, Perenco retained Walsh Environmental Scientists and Engineers to conduct an evaluation of the Jungal swamp. It issued a report concurring with Perenco's belief that a preceding operator was responsible. Exhibit E-163, *Informe T\u00e9cnico: Caracterizaci\u00f3n del Pasivo Ambiental Adyacente a la Plataforma Payamino 2-8 - Campo Unificado Coca-Payamino*, dated October 2010. Ecuador alleged that the Walsh report was intended to find another operator responsible in the hopes of avoiding liability.\n\nExhibit E-161, Letter from Perenco to the Minister of Environment dated 11 June 2010.\n\n443.\n\nAnother document exhibits the same attitude. In an email of 19 December 2008 to the Block 7 HES Supervisor, Mr. Saltos referred to an upcoming inspection of the Block 7 Jaguar Field in the following terms:\n\n\" Please, closely read the initial soap opera documents listed below and apply immediate corrective action so that, when the inspection date comes, we will not have to regret unfavorable reports... We must especially update:\n\nDischarge of served waters from a plant... We have to clean the banks of the canal, about 100 meters below the discharge, clean the grease trap, confirm parameters; we have to take into account that we already have NC + [i.e., a major non-conformity976] included in the 2008 audit, precisely due to this finding, and that Dinapah [sic] has sentenced us with an ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD and FINE which we have yet to know who will pay (?) or who we will impose it on (?).\"\n\nThe site destined to treatment of contaminated soil... we must review that the containment ditches and grease traps are operating well (if not, we have to construct them immediately).\n\n\u2026\n\nIt is necessary that we verify, and ensure compliance with the recommended works since, due to the distance, this will surely be assigned to the coordinators of south, which, to me, has a \"reserved prognosis\", until the contrary is demonstrated.\n\nI especially recommend not creating too much attention around these works (military?), so that there is no resistance, and so that it cannot be documented, (be careful with pictures) that we are doing this, because the referenced inspection is approaching; it will be very appropriate for us to do this on holidays and without using Manguilla workers.\"977\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Saltos acknowledged that the term \"NC +\" in the 2008 Audit referred to a major noncompliance: see Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1491-1492 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos).\n\nSee Annex 61 to 2nd Witness Statement of Manuel Sol\u00eds; as discussed at Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1489-1499 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos) [Emphasis added.]\n\n444.\n\nWhen cross-examined, Mr. Saltos downplayed any suggestion that he was trying to mislead the authorities or avoid having the problem documented, and sought to put his views in a better light as follows: \"We have a word that has to do with the wheeling and dealing, and the things that may cause more problems than the ones with that we want to solve.\"978\n\nSo that's why I say \u2018military' in between parentheses because we had a group of military personnel that gave us some physical security and protection, and they were there on the field. But their role is--they don't have much to do during the day. So as soon as they saw that someone was moving or doing some sort of activity, they took pictures and they sent the pictures to their supervisors. So the pictures and the reports made their way to the authorities of the company, and even outside the company, and they caused unnecessary problems and sometimes serious problems that were unfounded. So I wanted to avoid that so that the military were not in the area. That's what I was referring to.979\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, p 1498 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1498-1499 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos).\n\n445.\n\nThe Tribunal is not satisfied that this testimony cleared up the document's infelicities.\n\n446.\n\nIt might be that these documents are not representative of Perenco's general approach to the stewardship of the Blocks.980 But combined with Mr. Puente's unchallenged testimony that the 2008 Block 7 audit was organised to focus on areas that were previously cleaned up - the same thing that Mr. Saltos was urging the Block 7 HES Supervisor to do before the inspection took place - and the limited sampling performed in the 2008 audit of Block 7, the documentary evidence casts doubt on Perenco's claim that \"whenever an incident occurred that affected the environment, the Consortium promptly notified the State, performed all required repairs, remediation and cleanup and obtained the State's approval of the remediation.\"981 It also underscores the Tribunal's belief that with operations in a rainforest environment and the self-reporting nature of the regulatory regime, the environmental regime is only as good as the information that is discoverable, reported and acted on.\n\nThere are a number of documents on the record that show the timely reporting of spills to the authorities.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 120, 133-139.\n\n**(15) Conclusion on Perenco's Environmental Management Practices in Blocks 7 and 21**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that Perenco's claims of strong environmental law compliance are not made out. While the Tribunal is not prepared to find that Perenco consistently sought to conceal instances of contamination, there is some evidence that it was less than forthcoming in some instances. The 2010 memorandum's comment on the Payamino 2-8 contamination that the \"State will probably assume that we are hiding many more [environmental] damages and will scrutinize the operations area in search for more damages and it will probably find them\" is very troubling. This evidence, combined with the company's failure to document the environmental condition of the two Blocks at the time of the acquisition of its interests, its failure to conduct the statutorily required audits in 2004, its use of outdated environmental documents during the course of the operations, its failure to obtain necessary licenses, the increase in the incidence of nonconformities detected in the 2006 and 2008 audits, and Mr. Puente's unchallenged testimony as to the approach taken in the 2008 Block 7 audit do not paint a picture of a responsible environmental steward.\n\n448.\n\nWith these observations in mind, the Tribunal now turns to the expert evidence on the environmental condition of the two Blocks.\n\n**C. Modelling versus Delineation**\n-----------------------------------\n\n449.\n\nTurning to the modelling versus delineation method of mapping the extent of the contamination, this can be determined summarily. Although the evidence relating to modelling versus delineation took up a substantial amount of time at the hearing, the Tribunal believes it can express its views simply without going into great detail about this evidence.982\n\nThe Parties' contentions in respect of this particular issue are set out in detail at paragraphs 197 to 283 of this Decision and it is unnecessary of the Tribunal to repeat the points in order to explain its reasoning.\n\n450.\n\nThe Tribunal has no hesitation in coming down squarely in favour of delineation. The reasons are manifold, but the principal ones are the following.\n\n451.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal was convinced that the maps resulting from the use of the ArcGIS software which sought to model the extent of the contamination in the two Blocks did not adequately reflect their topography. The \"spilled coffee on the crumpled paper\" demonstrative exhibit employed by IEMS' Mr. Chaves during the course of direct examination did not convince the Tribunal that the model sufficiently accounted for topography and therefore was more accurate than delineation measurements taken around areas of the Blocks which showed regulatory exceedances.\n\n452.\n\nSecond, although the Tribunal has no reason to doubt IEMS' environmental credentials in general and considers the witneses to be serious professionals, it found that its representatives' attempts to explain how they had employed the software program and their responses to questions posed during cross-examination did not exhibit either a sufficient degree of precision and clarity or show an adequate use of the software's internal validation methods to be able to engender the Tribunal's confidence in the mapping exercise, particularly given the very large areas of purported contamination that were generated by the software's use.983\n\nSee Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, pp 1121-1128 (Testimony of IEMS); Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1197-1269 (Testimony of IEMS).\n\n453.\n\nBy contrast, the Tribunal considered that Dr. Rouhani persuasively demonstrated that the Arc-GIS software modelling conducted by IEMS was not performed to a sufficient standard of reliability. For example, Mr. Chaves and Dr. Rouhani agreed that ArcGIS contained a means of testing results known as \"cross-validation.\"984 On cross-examination, Mr. Chaves testified that he ran a cross-validation analysis for only one map out of the hundreds that he created.985 It was then shown that the error demonstrated in this cross-validation was substantial.986\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1217-1223 (Testimony of IEMS); Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 7, pp 2016-2022 (Testimony of Sharhokh Rouhani).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1218-1222 (Testimony of IEMS). Claimant's Reply PostHearing Brief, paragraph 43. It appears that Mr. Chaves ran one cross-validation on Coca 8, Layer A, barium. Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1219 (Testimony of IEMS).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1225-1230 (Testimony of IEMS).\n\n454.\n\nThird, Dr. Rouhani described delineation as the \"standard conventional approach\" when seeking to characterise and quantify contamination.987 In this respect, Ecuador's other environmental experts, RPS, also acknowledged on cross-examination that \"delineation is a standard approach to defining the edges of contamination\" and that they did not fault GSI for using that method.988\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 7, p 1958 (Testimony of Shahrokh Rouhani).\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1395-1396 (Testimony of RPS).\n\n455.\n\nFourth, the Tribunal notes GSI's evidence that in some areas that had been represented as contaminated in IEMS' map, GSI had found clean delineation samples and indeed IEMS itself found clean samples, yet the model had predicted contamination.989\n\nPerenco's Closing Statement Slide 145; Perenco's Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 78.\n\n**(1) Conclusion on Modelling versus Delineation**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n456.\n\nIn sum, the general use of delineation in the industry when seeking to determine the existence and extent of contamination, the difficulty exhibited by IEMS when seeking to explain what they had done in the modelling exercise, Dr. Rouhani's contrasting testimony which was clear and convincing, considered together with the demonstrative exhibits employed by the Parties, has created such strong doubt in the Tribunal's mind that it is compelled to reject the mapping exercise in its entirety. Given its view as to the frailties of IEMS' mapping exercise, the Tribunal considers that delineation of contaminated sites is the appropriate means of ascertaining the volume of soil that requires remediation.\n\n**D. The Tribunal's Findings on the Regulatory Standards That Should be Applied**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nGiven that it now has before it a \"regulatory exceedances case\" as opposed to a \"background values case\", the Tribunal turns to the question of which regulatory standards apply.\n\n458.\n\nThe principal issues, as the Tribunal sees them, are the following: (i) whether RAOHE Annex 2, Table 6 represents the comprehensive list of contaminants when testing for environmental damage as a result of hydrocarbon operations or whether TULAS Tables 2 or 3 provide additional remediation criteria that should be applied; (ii) whether the regulatory criteria in Ecuador requires the use of \"indicator parameters\" when testing for contamination of the environment by hydrocarbon activities; (iii) which land-use classification should be applied under Ecuador's regulatory criteria; (iv) whether Table 7(a) or Table 7(b) of RAOHE applies to the testing of the mud pits in the two Blocks; and (v) in relation to groundwater testing, whether Ecuadorian regulatory criteria for groundwater testing admit of filtration in collecting samples.\n\n459.\n\nEach will be addressed in turn.\n\n**(1) Whether RAOHE Annex 2, Table 6 represents the comprehensive list of contaminants when testing for environmental damage as a result of hydrocarbon operations or whether TULAS Tables 2 or 3 provide additional remediation criteria that should be applied**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n460.\n\nThe Parties and their experts diverged on whether the proper regulatory criteria to be applied were confined to the contaminants listed in Table 6, Annex 2, of RAOHE or whether they also included the contaminants listed in Tables 2 or 3 of Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS.990\n\nSee above at paragraphs 86 to 107, 217 to 312.\n\n461.\n\nPerenco and GSI proceeded on the basis that Table 6, Annex 2, of RAOHE provided the sum total of what should be tested for in the case of remediation of soil contamination resulting from hydrocarbon operations. Ecuador and IEMS, in formulating the alternative regulatory case, disagreed. In preparing its alternative case, IEMS measured its sampling results against the standards stipulated by RAOHE and, it submitted, where applicable, TULAS Table 2. In its first expert report, IEMS identified the parameters it had tested for as TPH, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nickel, cadmium, lead, barium and vanadium.991 Barium and vanadium are not elements regulated by RAOHE Table 6, but they are listed in Tables 2 and 3, Annex 2 of Book VI of TULAS.992\n\nIEMS ER I, pp 20-24, 26.\n\nIEMS ER I, pp 21-27; 48-61.\n\n462.\n\nBy the time of its second expert report, IEMS added chromium, potential hydrogen (pH) and electrical conductivity to its list of elements.993 These elements are similarly governed only by Tables 2 and 3, Annex 2 of Book VI of TULAS. In its third expert report, IEMS excluded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chromium because it stated they had not been identified in their field sampling at \"concentrations greater than the regulatory reference criteria.\"994 Thus, in addition to the RAOHE, Table 6 elements, IEMS continued to apply Table 2, Annex 2 of Book VI of TULAS to two remaining elements: barium and vanadium.995\n\nIEMS ER II, pp 42-48.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 12.\n\nIEMS III, p 44.\n\n463.\n\nEcuador contended that Ecuadorian law requires TULAS to be applied to the analysis of soil (and groundwater) remediation.996 In its view, TULAS addressed chemical indicators and heavy metals associated with hydrocarbon operations that are not considered in RAOHE, namely electrical conductivity, pH, barium and vanadium.997\n\nExhibit EL-146, TULAS; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 164 and footnote 27. See above at paragraphs 97-107.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n464.\n\nPerenco's response was that TULAS was intended to generally govern activities that may cause an impact on the environment, but that the legal regime in Ecuador operated such that as regards activities that were more likely to require environmental authorisations and had a greater potential of impact on the environment, specific regulation is promulgated in accordance with the technical standards established in TULAS. This was the case with hydrocarbon operations. Moreover, it was Table 3, not Table 2, of Annex 2 of Book VI of TULAS that stood to provide any additional contaminant criteria for the identification and remediation of contaminated soil.998\n\nSee above at paragraph 73.\n\n465.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with a consideration of TULAS's objective, as articulated in the opening section to Annex 2 (which contains Tables 2 and 3). Its purpose is to provide general technical standards, as authorised by two other instruments of general application: the Environmental Management Act and the Regulations to the Environmental Management Act for the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution. These standards are to be used to \"determine or set\" the \"rules of general application for different soil uses\" across a range of industries and activities.999 Its reach insofar as the industries and activities it governs is concerned is limited only by whether they require environmental authorisations in connection with their activities. The technical standards are intended for use by the State and its agencies in its administration of powers or actions to \"preserve, conserve or recover the quality of soil resources.\"1000 In other words, in administering the rules that govern areas of industry or activity that affect the environment, the onus is on the competent authority to ensure that it acts consistently with TULAS.\n\n(Original) \" ***O INTRODUCCION***  *La presente norma t\u00e9cnica ambiental es dictada bajo el amparo de la Ley* *de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental y del Reglamento a la Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental para la Prevenci\u00f3n y Control de la Contaminaci\u00f3n Ambiental y se somete a las disposiciones de \u00e9stos, es de aplicaci\u00f3n obligatoria y rige en todo el territorio nacional.

Las acciones tendientes a preservar, conservar o recuperar la calidad del recurso suelo deber\u00e1n realizarse en los t\u00e9rminos de la presente Norma T\u00e9cnica Ambiental.\"*\n\n466.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is Table 3, rather than Table 2, of Annex 2 of Book VI of TULAS that addresses the identification and remediation of contaminated soil. As noted above, Table 3 accepts that there is an activity that may affect the environment and reflects the balance that has been struck by the regulator between activity and a tolerable impact on the environment. Notably, unlike Table 2, Table 3 offers separate criteria according to four different land-use classifications: agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial.\n\n467.\n\nBy contrast, Table 2, entitled \"Soil Quality Standards\", sets out non-site specific standards for the *background* values of 36 different elements that may be present in soil. Article 4.2.1 explains that Table 2 sets out background values or analytical detection limits that reflect the \"natural geological variations of *undeveloped or areas free of the influence of generalized industrial or urban activities*.\"1001 The definition of \"[b]aseline (background)\" in TULAS (Article 2.38) refers to \"conditions which prevailed in the absence of anthropogenic activities, only natural processes in activity.\"1002 Table 3 is titled \"Soil Remediation or Restoration Criteria\" and its opening paragraph defines it as \"[t]he Remediation or Restoration criteria are established in accordance with the use of soil\", said to comprise the \"maximum contaminant concentration levels for of soil in the process of remediation or restoration.\"1003\n\nExhibit EL-146, TULAS, pp 361-262 (unofficial translation) [Bolding in orginal, emphasis added in italics.] (translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013); (Original) \" ***4.2.1 Criterios de Calidad del Suelo***  *Los criterios de calidad, son valores de fondo aproximados o l\u00edmites anal\u00edticos de detecci\u00f3n para un contaminante en el suelo.

It would be counterintuitive to ignore the fact that Table 3 expressly describes itself as stipulating the criteria for the remediation and restoration of soil and to proceed on the basis that while Table 2 is used to identify whether a site should be remediated, Table 3 provides the limits that should be observed by the party remediating the site such that the remediation should bring the concentration of contaminants to below those limits. Moreover, similar to RAOHE, Table 6, Table 3 offers criteria which are specific to land-uses such that, for example, in the case of land that is put to residential use, its limits of permitted disturbances are lower than those stipulated for industrial land.1004\n\nExhibit EL-146, TULAS, pp 363-366 (unofficial translation).\n\n469.\n\nWith this in mind, the Tribunal turns to consider the issue of the relationship between Table 6, Annex 2 of RAOHE and Table 3 of Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS.\n\n470.\n\nThe Tribunal is conscious of the imperative in Ecuadorian constitutional law to proceed in a manner most protective of the environment, and considers that to exclude TULAS's treatment of soil contamination and remediation entirely would undermine this goal and it would contradict the objective and purpose of Annex 2 of Book VI of TULAS. Moreover, it notes that IEMS and Ecuador's approach in this arbitration has not been to advocate testing for every single contaminant listed in Table 3, but rather to home in on barium and vanadium in addition to the contaminants in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6, because they are elements that they contend can be found in the by-products of the hydrocarbon exploitation process.1005 Perenco, for its part, has in its experts' selection of \"indicator parameters\" included barium as an indicator of the effect of hydrocarbon operations in soil.1006 Barium, as noted before, is not a parameter that is addressed in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6. That would suggest that Perenco accepts that there may be a need to look outside of RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6, for permissible values.\n\nSee above at paragraphs 97, 105, 195-196 cf. 229; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 167; IEMS ER I, pp 23-24.\n\nSee above at paragraphs 241-243,,258, 305\n\n471.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this is a reasonable approach to adopt and further notes that TULAS was included in the 2002 and 2008 audits of Blocks 7 and 21, though not consistently with regard to the analysis of soil contamination.1007 It finds it pertinent, in particular, to note a conclusion in the 2008 audit of Block 7 conducted by *Ecuambiente* that TULAS had \"not been taken into account in PERENCO's environmental management. While the RAOHE does describe applicable criteria for the hydrocarbon industry, it does not contain all of the requirements PERENCO must observe.\"1008\n\nSee, for e.g., Exhibits E-144, 2008 Block 7 Audit, pp 39, 46; E-145, 2008 Block 21 Audit, p 4-8, Table 511.\n\nExhibit E-144, 2008 Block 7 Audit, p 77.\n\n472.\n\nThe Tribunal makes this finding of TULAS's applicability to certain substances that might be associated with oilfield contamination mindful that an examination of the environmental audits and assessments performed from 1999 to 2010 seems to show inconsistent treatment of choice of regulatory criteria. RAOHE Table 6 is a constant for soil contamination, but otherwise with respect to whether Table 2, Table 3 or Table 5 of Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS should be applied, it is difficult to pinpoint a consistent practice. For example, the May 2010 assessment done by ENTRIX, as commissioned by Petramazonas, refers to Table 3 of TULAS for water quality (when the table is entitled soil remediation).1009 In principle, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to consult TULAS where RAOHE is silent.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-241, Ex-post Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Coca Complex, Block 7, June 2010.\n\n**(1.1) Conclusion on whether RAOHE Annex 2, Table 6 represents the comprehensive list of contaminants or whether TULAS Tables 2 or 3 provide additional remediation criteria that should be applied**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n473.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Table 6, Annex 2 of RAOHE applies to the identification and remediation of contaminated soil, but to the extent that it is silent, for example, on two soil contaminants, barium and vanadium, at issue in this case, TULAS Book VI, Annex 2, Table 3, applies. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that it is permissible to look at TULAS, Book VI, Annex 2, Table 3 for those substances that may be generated in hydrocarbon operations that are not addressed in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6.\n\n**(2) The use of \"indicator parameters\"**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n474.\n\nAnother area in which the experts diverged on how to apply the regulatory criteria was with respect to GSI's use of \"indicator parameters\" to screen its sampling results and, in its submission, isolate results that depicted contaminants associated with hydrocarbon operations as opposed to those that more likely resulted from other activities in the Blocks or in their vicinity.\n\n475.\n\nOne of the first steps in GSI's investigation was to combine its sampling results and those collected by IEMS in its first two expert reports in this arbitration. In reviewing IEMS' sampling results, and based on its view of what sort of pollutants might be generated in the Blocks, GSI employed what it termed were the \"primary indicators of oilfield materials\"; namely, TPH,1010 barium, electrical conductance or chloride.1011 It excluded samples that did not exhibit at least one of these \u2018primary indicators': \"[t]he presence of other chemicals in the soil, in the absence of a primary indicator (e.g., nickel in the absence of elevated barium or TPH), *cannot be caused by an oilfield material* and was therefore not retained for further investigation.\"1012 GSI submitted that this was tied to the three primary sources of potential environmental effects produced in the process of extracting oil: use and disposal of drilling mud (barium), extraction of crude oil (TPH), and production of formation water (soil electrical conductance).1013 As a result, it concluded that 91% of the 1243 soil samples collected by IEMS did not evidence \"soil impact by oilfield materials.\"1014\n\nTPH or Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons refers to hydrocarbon compounds derived from petroleum. It can be used to detect the presence of test crude, which is crude used to determine the well's production capacity and the quality of the oil at the start of the drilling process of a well. GSI ER I, paragraphs 36, 225; Claimant's CounterMemorial, paragraph 76.\n\nGSI ER I, section 2.4.3, paragraphs 36-38. It defined indicator parameters as \"chemicals or groups of chemicals that are present at significant concentrations in the source material and are readily detectable by field or laboratory analysis.\"; see Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 60.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 181(1) [Emphasis added]; Reply, paragraph 73.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 16, 34, 36, 225; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 60-76.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 181(1) [Emphasis added].\n\n476.\n\nIEMS responded that this approach was contrary to Ecuadorian regulations and rendered meaningless key elements of RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS (irrespective of whether Table 2 or Table 3 applied). RPS concurred, contending that GSI's approach resulted in excluding all heavy metal contamination found in Blocks 7 and 21, rendering Ecuadorian regulations which specifically identified and regulated heavy metals \"wholly pointless.\"1015\n\nReply, paragraph 74; RPS ER III, section 3.2.\n\n477.\n\nEcuador's experts further submitted that GSI's position was contradicted by Perenco's own prior practice, as evidenced in an \u2018Environmental Protection Guide' it had developed during the course of its operatorship in which it listed a total of 16 indicators that should be monitored. This list included TPH, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and was not conditioned on whether they presented themselves in association with hydrocarbon, barium or any other indicator substance.1016\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.1, p 14 referring to Attachment 3 to the report; Reply, paragraph 77.\n\n478.\n\nRPS was particularly critical of GSI's decision to use indicator parameters, which RPS considered unduly narrowed the scope of GSI's investigation. RPS noted that while GSI had stated that its objective was to \"provide an objective evaluation of the work conducted by IEMS and, at the same time, achieve a comprehensive assessment of current environmental conditions for each of the 74 oilfield facilities investigated by IEMS in the CPUF, Block 7 and Block 21\"1017, it conducted visual site inspections at only 58 of the 74 oilfield facilities investigated by IEMS and then actually investigated only 24 of the 74 facilities with the collection and analysis of soil and/or groundwater samples.\n\nRPS ER III, p 2 quoting from GSI ER I, p 1.\n\n479.\n\nWhen it came to analysing the majority of such samples, GSI used the short list of indicator parameters. This, in RPS's view, \"severely limits their ability to understand the full nature of impacts from historical oilfield operations and can accordingly lead to certain contaminants not being detected contrary to GSI's stated objective of achieving a comprehensive assessment of the environmental conditions\" in the Blocks.1018\n\nRPS ER III, p 5.\n\n480.\n\nRPS devoted four pages of its report to a discussion of indicator parameters' potential for generating a misleading picture of the Blocks' environmental conditions. In its view, GSI performed a subset of soil sampling which it described as \"risk characterization\" samples, the stated objective in using such samples being \"to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the potential risks posed to human health.\"1019 Whereas 333 \"confirmation and delineation\" soil samples were tested only for the following analytes: Gasoline Range Organics, Diesel Range Organics, Oil Range Organics, Barium, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, and Nickel, only 57 \"risk characterization\" soil samples were tested for the foregoing and an additional 49 other potential contaminants.1020\n\nGSI ER I, pp 70-72, 107-108.\n\nRPS prepared a comparative table on this point at pp 16-17 of its third expert report [Emphasis added.].\n\n481.\n\nGSI defended its use of indicator parameters as follows:\n\nThe validity of the \"primary indicator approach\" is illustrated by the fact that, among the 3,561 soil samples collected and analyzed by GSI, Walsh, and IEMS, only 39 soil samples (1%) exceeded a regulatory criterion for a non-indicator parameter (i.e., cadmium, chromium, lead, vanadium, and nickel) outside of an area otherwise designated for remediation of primary indicators (i.e., barium or TPH) and outside the paved platform area. Of the total 249 soil samples exceeding an applicable regulatory criterion outside the paved platform area, the primary indicator compounds (210 samples) represent 84% of the total exceedances, while the non-indicator compounds (39 samples) represent only 16% of the total exceedances. Consequently, for these oilfield sites, the primary indicators are clearly effective for *identification* of impacts, while the other nonindicator chemicals generally serve as additional criteria to be applied for *remediation* within the impacted areas.1021\n\nGSI ER II, paragraph 45 d) [Italics in original.].\n\n482.\n\nGSI's defence has not assuaged the Tribunal's doubts about its use of indicator parameters. The Tribunal was particularly struck by RPS's assertion that less than 15% of GSI's soil samples were analysed for the full set of individual contaminants that are associated with the impact of oil field operations on the environment.1022 Given the narrowness of the samples' testing, RPS concluded that GSI's conclusion that, \"at no location do environmental conditions pose a risk to human health, nor are their impacts to groundwater resources at any investigated site\" could not be reasonably made: \"GSI's reliance upon indicator parameters that exclude chemical compounds harmful to human health for the majority of the soil samples it collected (greater than 85%) prevents them from being able to support their claim of no risk to human health.\"1023\n\nRPS ER III, p16.\n\nRPS ER III *,* p 18.\n\n483.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that using indicator parameters was the correct way to proceed. Neither RAOHE nor TULAS refer to soil sampling and analysis that screens its results based on whether it presents a particular permutation or combination of elements. RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6, which in Perenco's own submission is the regulation specific to the testing for soil contamination that occurs as a result of and in the process of exploiting hydrocarbons, reflects a prior determination by the Ecuadorian authorities of the kinds of elements in the soil that should be tested for as likely to be attributable to hydrocarbon activities. It is an act of regulatory power and discretion that would be undermined by restricting sample testing to \"indicator parameters.\" The Tribunal is also mindful of RPS's examples, such as an area near Payamino 1, which GSI had identified as exhibiting \"oil residue associated with a former produced water surface impoundment\" but which it then excluded on the basis that samples from the site did not indicate any environmental harm based on electrical conductance (one of its \"indicator parameters\").1024\n\nReply, section 2.1.2.2; RPS ER III, section 3.2.\n\n484.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal agrees with IEMS and RPS that GSI's use of \"indicator parameters\" is inconsistent with Perenco's own environmental audits, assessments and reports in relation to Blocks 7 and 21. The 2002 audit that was carried out relatively soon after Perenco took over the Blocks does not refer to \"indicator parameters\"; it tested for the full list of contaminants in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6...1025 Similarly, in the 2008 audit, on which Perenco placed considerable emphasis in these proceedings, the samples were tested against each parameter in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6...1026\n\nSee exhibits E-266, \" *Auditor\u00eda Ambiental Bloque 7 - 2002, Perenco Ecuador Limited*,\" dated December 2002 and E-267, \" *Auditor\u00eda Ambiental del Bloque 21*,\" prepared by Eficiencia Energ\u00e9tica y Ambiental Eficacitas Consultora C\u00eda.

The Tribunal is also mindful of Ecuador's view that it does not have a sufficient level of confidence as to a comprehensive list of what chemicals were used by Perenco throughout its operatorship.1027 If that is the case, the argument for dismissing the use of \"indicator parameters\" is perforce stronger.\n\nEcuador noted in its Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 66, that: \"Perenco further failed to provide evidence that the presence of such contaminants did not result from oilfield operations and refused to disclose the list of chemicals it used in these operations [Procedural Order No. 4, Request 9].\" Perenco did not reply to this particular allegation in its Reply Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n**(3) Land-use classification**\n-------------------------------\n\n486.\n\nAnother major point of difference between the Parties, once that the \"background values\" case is put to one side and the focus is on the regulatory regime, concerns the choice of land-use classifications applicable to different locations within the Blocks. Ecuador asserted that more than 50% of what it considers to be the contaminated area falls within the Amazonian rainforest and therefore in its view qualifies under the sensitive ecosystem land-use criterion.1028 Perenco disagrees.1029\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 36; see above at paragraphs 221, 278-279.\n\nSee above at paragraphs 214, 215, 247-252.\n\n487.\n\nEcuador submitted that amongst its different land-use criteria, it was the \"sensitive ecosystems\" criteria that should be applied to the Blocks in light of their location in the Ecuadorian Amazon and the 2008 Constitution's emphasis on full restoration and protection of the environment.1030 Moreover, it submitted that Table 6 of RAOHE referred to \"posterior use\" which, in its view, was meant to facilitate site re-use and should be interpreted to refer to the future land use to which the site will reasonably be put.1031\n\nReply, paragraphs 294-303; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 15-17; IEMS ER III, p 45; Exhibit EL-147, RAOHE, p 7 of PDF; see also Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 70-72 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero).\n\nIEMS ER III, pp 41-48; Reply, paragraphs 294-303; see above at paragraphs 248-249.\n\n488.\n\nIEMS criticised GSI's approach because, in its view, it should have applied the stricter standards prescribed by RAOHE for a \"sensitive ecosystem\" rather than the more relaxed industrial and agricultural area standards.1032 It contended that while the Blocks were not a designated protected area under Ecuadorian law, its ecological studies confirmed that most areas displayed characteristics \"similar to those of a National Natural Area.\"1033\n\nIEMS ER III, pp 41-48.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 41, see also, pp 41-47.\n\n489.\n\nGSI, for its part, asserted that IEMS had mischaracterised the applicable land-use criteria and as a result this had invalidated two-thirds of its samples, accounting for over US$ 885 million of its US$ 2.4 billion claim.1034 GSI applied sensitive ecosystems criteria to \"the small amount of land that f[ell] within a designated protected area\", correlating to 89 of IEMS' 1243 sampling locations.1035 It otherwise applied agricultural or industrial land-use criteria in its analysis.1036\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 15-17, 277-282; GSI ER I, paragraph 11(7). GSI submitted that IEMS' failure to apply the correct regulatory criteria resulted in the incorrect categorisation of 568 samples as contaminated: GSI ER I, paragraph 11(7), Exhibit 3.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 288, footnote 352; GSI ER I, Appendix F.5.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 279, 283, section III.B.2(c). Perenco submitted that the majority of its operations in Blocks 7 and 21 would result in the classification of the land-use as industrial (Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 289). Examples of practice of Ecuadorian authorities applying industrial criteria at paragraphs 292-297 of its Counter-Memorial. See also, 1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 57-68.\n\n490.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, a number of factors bear upon this issue. First, the 2008 Constitution's imperative in favour of the protection of the environment should, in any case of doubt, militate in favour of applying the most stringent land-use designation. But this does not mean that an area that has clearly become an industrial or agricultural area and is reasonably expected to remain as such for the foreseeable future should be re-designated as a sensitive ecosystem, particularly where oilfield operations continue to be conducted. The Tribunal recognises that the posterior use of the land is the central concern, but there is the practical consideration that the Blocks are expected to be operated for many years to come and that it would be unjust to require Perenco to bear the cost of restoration for land and platforms that are now being used by Petroamazonas and are still distant from any \"posterior use.\"\n\n491.\n\nSecond, and related to the first point, the Tribunal considers that the treatment of this issue should be guided by the Ecuadorian authorities' practice in relation to the Blocks. The evidence shows that the authorities accepted the application of industrial land-use criteria in certain parts of Blocks 7 and 21, in particular, in the January 2003 Remediation Plan relating to the Payamino Sanitary Landfill, Payamino 22, Payamino CPF, Coca CPF and Jaguar CPF as approved by the Ministry,1037 the report of a clean-up of a spill at Payamino 19 in June 2009,1038 the Consortium's EIS for the construction of the Oso A and Oso B platforms and the Yuralpa Norte platform in April and October 2006,1039 and, most significantly, in the environmental impact studies commissioned by Ecuador in 2010.1040\n\nExhibits CE-CC-51, Letter of January 28, 2003 from Perenco to DINAPA, attaching the Remediation Program for Block 7, including Coca-Payamino field; CE-CC-54, Letter of April 22, 2003 from Perenco to DINAPA, p 1; see Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 292.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 293, referring to Exhibit CE-CC-86, Sandblasting, Painting, and Mechanical Repairs to Gacela Station Tank (101-Tk).\n\nExhibits CE-CC-110, Environmental Impact Study for the Construction of Platforms Oso A and Oso B, Access Road, and Drilling and Production Activities in Block 7, April 2006; CE-CC-122, Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for the Construction of the Yuralpa Norte Platform, Access Road, and Drilling and Production Activities, October 2006; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 294.\n\nExhibits CE-CC-241, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Coca Complex, Block 7, June 2010, section 3, p 17 (EIS contracted by Petroamazonas for Coca, Payamino and Gacela Fields); CE-CC-242, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Mono Complex, Block 7, June 2010, section 3.1.6.2 (pp 15-17) (EIS contracted by Petroamazonas for Mono and Jaguar fields); CE-CC-236, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for the Oso Complex in Block 7 and the Drilling of Three Additional Wells in Oso A, June 2010, section 3.1.6.3 (EIS contracted by Petroamazonas for Oso Field).\n\n492.\n\nEcuadorian authorities similarly accepted the application of agricultural land-use criteria in areas surrounding platforms in Blocks 7 and 21 such as in the Ministry-approved remediation plan for the May 2007 spill from the Oso 2 flow line,1041 the January 2008 Ministry-approved remediation plan for a spill in the Gacela-Payamino flow line in October 2007,1042 and in the environmental impact studies commissioned by Ecuador in 2010.1043 In the present proceeding, IEMS itself accepted that the areas surrounding Coca 6, Coca 8, Lobo 3, Lobo 1, Oso 9, Mono CPF, and Payamino CPF were primarily used for agricultural purposes.1044\n\nExhibits CE-CC-116, Letter of June 4, 2006 from the Consortium to DINAPA; CE-CC-153, Letter of January 11, 2008 from the Consortium to DINAPA; CE-CC-138, Letter of August 14, 2007 from Ministry of Mines and Petroleum to the Consortium; CE-CC-197, Letter of February 11, 2009 from the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection to the Consortium.\n\nExhibits CE-CC-140, Letter of October 8, 2007 from the Consortium to DINAPA; CE-CC-151, Letter of January 10, 2008 from the Consortium to Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection; CE-CC-203, Letter of February 25, 2009 from the Consortium to DINAPA.\n\nExhibits CE-CC-241, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Coca Complex, Block 7, June 2010, section 3, pp 79-81; CE-CC-242, Expost Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Management Plan for Mono Complex, Block 7, June 2010, section 3, pp 51, 175.\n\nIEMS ER II, Annex H, pp 7, 56, 60, 78; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 300-311.\n\n493.\n\nThis is not to say that, once selected, the land-use criteria are irrevocable and the decision cannot be changed. However, there is significant probative value to be derived from the authorities' acceptance of a particular land-use criterion with respect to the same area for the purpose of measuring soil remediation.\n\n494.\n\nIt is also clear to the Tribunal that the sensitive ecosystem designation is not limited to designated protected zones. RAOHE makes clear that the designation applies in areas \" *such as* the National Heritage of Natural Areas1045*and others* identified in the corresponding Environmental Study.\"1046 GSI's initial approach was to restrict the use of the sensitive ecosystem criterion to those areas alone.1047 The Tribunal notes that GSI itself accepted that the \"sensitive ecosystems criteria\" might apply to a number of sites in the Blocks which intersected with State-designated sensitive ecosystem areas: Payamino CPF, Payamino 1, Payamino 2-8, Payamino 19, Waponi-Ocatoe and Nemoca.1048\n\nHeritage of State Natural Areas (*Patrimonio de \u00c1reas Naturales del Estado*): Claimant's CounterMemorial, paragraph 283, section III.B.2(c).\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, p 57 [Emphasis added.]. Table 6, Annex 2 of RAOHE, is depicted above at Chart 1.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 278-279; 1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraphs 75-77.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**(3.1) Conclusion on land-use criteria**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n495.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that that in view of the 2008 Constitution's imperative in favour of the protection of the environment, in any case of doubt where a site could be considered to fall under either of two designations, the more stringent land-use designation should be applied. In the Tribunal's view, where a posterior land use has not been designated, Article 395.4 of the 2008 Constitution's focus on full restoration should guide in determining the appropriate land use and it should be in favour of the most environmentally-protective designation that is reasonable in the circumstances of the particular case. At the same time, the prior determinations of the Ecuadorian authorities have significant probative value.\n\n496.\n\nFor present purposes, the Tribunal reserves its position on the posterior land use question with respect to any oil well or drilling platform (or other installation) that was retired during Perenco's operatorship. This is discussed in further detail below.\n\n**(4) The approach to the testing and evaluation of mud pits**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nThe investigation of mud pits was fraught with a number of divisive issues. The first issue was whether to exclude soil samples that were taken from *inside* closed mud pits when measuring soil contamination in the Blocks. The second issue, which bears some relation to the first, is whether the leachate testing method should be used and, in that connection, whether the appropriate regulatory criteria to be applied are found in Table 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE (GSI's approach) which governs leachates, rather than Table 6 of Annex 2 of RAOHE (IEMS' approach) which governs soil contamination generally. The third issue is the approach to determining whether Table 7(a), which provides the regulatory limits for pits that are not *bottom sealed*, or Table 7(b), which provides more generous regulatory limits for *sealed* pits, is more properly applied in a specific instance.1049\n\nGenerally, see above at paragraphs 90, 255-257, 274-277.\n\n498.\n\nThe issue is an important one because mud pits can constitute an important transport mechanism for groundwater contamination.1050 In its expert report, RPS included a schematic drawing that illustrates the potential problem.\n\nRPS in its third expert report criticised GSI for what it considered to be a generally inadequate treatment of exposure pathways of contaminants. In specific regard to mud pits, RPS noted: \"Indications that migration of chemicals of concern from primary sources (e.g., mud pits) to surface soil, subsurface soil, groundwater and surface water at the CPUF, Block 7, and Block 21 sites are of concern include 1) historical spills, 2) TCLP Test Results obtained by GSI indicating the potential for migration of chemicals from closed mud pits, 3) detection of TPH and inorganic chemicals in groundwater adjacent to mud pits and other waste management units, and 4) reported contamination of water supplies in these areas (IEMS Expert Report). There are examples where primary sources and contamination (secondary sources) are located adjacent to drainage areas, creeks, streams, swamps and other surface waters, with the potential for migration of chemicals to surface water and sediments and to adjacent land.\" RPS ER III, p 63. To this, GSI responded, in its second expert report, paragraph 155, that: \"We do not agree that a more extensive list of chemical analyses or a more complex analysis of potential future exposure pathways is necessary to determine whether current site conditions pose an unsafe risk to human health or livestock. IEMS and RPS have presented their criticisms of the GSI risk assessment, but they have not conducted their own risk assessment nor have they found that current conditions at the oilfield facilities actually pose an unsafe risk.\" The Tribunal did not find this persuasive. RPS was retained to review and critique GSI's analysis and it was GSI that described its exposure pathways analysis in its first report (pp 4, 107-108, Appendix E) and concluded that soil exposure was the only such pathway. IEMS' report was predicated upon a different mode of mapping contamination and it appears to the Tribunal that this reduced the perceived need to develop an exposure pathways analysis.\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it must follow the practice in Ecuador on this important issue. It notes that the disposal of drilling muds and cuttings in Ecuador has both before and since the 2008 Constitution been effected through the construction of *in situ* mud pits. It has not been directed to any evidence showing that at the end of operations of a particular platform, the operator has been required to dig up and either completely remediate the dessicated mud and cuttings *in situ* or remove that material for off-site remediation or storage. This is not what the Ecuadorian authorities have required.\n\n500.\n\nAlthough it recognises that Ecuador's primary case was premised principally on the full restoration objective, the Tribunal considers that drilling muds and cuttings are properly disposed of under the current regime if: (i) they are placed in properly constructed and graded pits as required by law; (ii) the operator properly treated the contents of the pits so as to ensure that it did not deposit muds and cuttings that contained analytes in quantities in excess of the applicable regulations; (iii) the pits have been properly covered and closed; and (iv) soil sampling at places around the pits shows no sign of leaching.1051\n\nIn its third expert report, RPS critically reviewed GSI's mud pits sampling at p 39. It also observed at p 44 that: \"... about 50% of the samples [taken by GSI] were collected from cover soils on top of closed mud pits. These cover soils are expected to be clean and analytical results do not represent potential concentrations in contaminated media.\"\n\n501.\n\nOne of the problems faced in this particular aspect of the counterclaim concerns the uncertainty of the information surrounding the pits' construction. During the documents production phase, Perenco was requested to produce documents pertaining to the design and construction of mud pits.1052 In its response, Perenco stated that it: \"...does not have a specific written policy for the construction, cleaning, monitoring, testing, and closing of pits.\"1053 It did however advert to Mr. Saltos' testimony that the company used liners as well as to interview notes in an annex to IEMS' third expert report in which certain former employees discussed the laying down of liners before depositing drilling muds therein.1054 However, reference to the notes shows that the evidence on the point was mixed and not fully supportive of Perenco's position because one former employee stated that undue care was taken in depositing drilling muds such that the liners cracked under the high termparatures.1055\n\nRequest #12 stated: \"Concerning the mud pits: (i) construction design plans for all the pits installed by or on behalf of the Consortium; (ii) the Consortium's procedures for building, cleaning, monitoring, testing and closing pits;... Procedural Order No. 4, 9 January 2013.\n\nPerenco's response to Request #12, 18 January 2013.\n\nMr. Saltos testified that Perenco regularly used synthetic liners. (Quoted at Rejoinder, paragraph 138.) The Rejoinder, at footnote 191, refers to the IEMS ER III, Attachment 17 (recording interviews with former Consortium employees, several of whom specifically note the Consortium's use of liners).\n\nAs discussed in IEMS 3rd Report page 28 (referring to Attachment 17).\n\n502.\n\nThe Schedule of Closed Mud Pits attached as Appendix A to the Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief on Counterclaims, which was prepared with both Parties' involvement and for which the Tribunal is grateful, regrettably shows that there are substantial disagreements as to whether many pits were lined or unlined. The \u2018Master List' records disagreement in at least 26 of 79 cases; the \u2018Pits Constructed by Perenco' list shows an even higher percentage of disagreement (14 of 18). The \u2018Pits Constructed by Prior Operators' shows 12 disagreements (of 63 entries) and many (36) unknowns.\n\n503.\n\nThere also appears to be a disagreement on whether a pit which might have been built in clay soil is to be considered to be \"sealed\"; GSI's Mr. Connor believed so, while IEMS did not. The Tribunal is not prepared to equate what have been assumed to be impermeable clay-based pits with those that have been lined within an impermeable synthetic barrier. This would first require the Tribunal to assume that the bottom of an unlined pit was in fact clay. IEMS adduced evidence that this was not necessarily the case; in some instances sandy soil is located near the pits.1056 During cross-examination, Mr. Connor admitted that, for example, when looking at a Coca 8 pit, GSI did not do any geotechnical testing and assumed that the bottom of the pit was lined with clay.1057\n\nSee Ecuador's Closing Presentation, Slides 111, 112 and 113.\n\nMr. Connor was cross examined on this point:  \n \"Q. Mr. Connor, have you assumed that all the pits in Blocks 7 and 21 are properly lined? Yes or no?  \n A. I believe that all the pits in Blocks 7 and 21 have some form of liner, whether it be natural soils or synthetic, and that would be consistent with the lithology of that region. So, in that regard, I've assumed that they do have either earthen or synthetic liners.\"  \n He was then asked:  \n \"Q. Now, did you perform any geotechnical studies or tests to actually confirm whether, beneath those pits, you have clay soil? Yes or no?  \n A. On the specific locations of the pits, I did not conduct a geotechnical test beneath that pit. I did not.\"  \n (See Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1786-1787 (Testimony of GSI).)\n\n504.\n\nIn addition, GSI appears to have assumed that the contents of all pits were cuttings and water-based muds and that the only key substance of possible concern was barium sulfate.1058 This does not appear to have always been the case because there appear to be some pits that contained oil-based muds.1059 Moreover, the evidence suggests that there are other substances associated with water-based drilling muds and these were not checked by GSI. During crossexamination, Mr. Connor was shown a 4 October 2006 inspection report prepared by the Orellana Department of the Environment which recorded the results of an inspection made after the complaint of a local landowner, Mr. Alberto Tanguila. The report noted that:\n\nIn one of the sides of the Coca #8 platform, there is a closed pits [sic] from where crude oil is coming out to the surface, (10:15h) a sample of superficial soil 0 to 20 cm was taken. (Coor.: X 027-0617 -Y: 995-5102)... Finally, when the drilling was finished, the tillable layer was moved from a nearby large extension of agricultural soil, in order to close the pits that were filled with oil in the pits that contain water were left open and filled with water. With time, oil has started to come out in the slopes near the platforms. Before the drilling, the slopes had clear water and the soil was hard rock, but now has been turned into swamps that cannot be used... Since at that time, it wasn't know (sic) that oil could cause illnesses, we weren't worried, but we now see that things are different and that we can't even find animals for hunting.1060\n\nRPS disagreed with this in its third expert report, p 43: \"Although barium sulfate \u2018 *is the major component of drilling muds used for drilling oil and gas wells* ' (GSI Expert Report, Section E.3.2, page E-14 [Emphasis of RPS]), barium sulfate is not the only component of drilling mud and the presence of additional constituents was not discussed by GSI. Water-based muds contain a number of additives that improve the properties of the mud. For example asphaltene (also called gilsonite) is listed as a primary additive in drilling muds in Perenco documents and is considered to be toxic (Entrix 2003, Tabla 3-4, pages 238 and 247; Entrix 2003, Tabla 4.1-2 pg. 4-4; Abrus 2005, Table 4-5, pages 4-13; and Martrex 2009). Asphaltene is a mixture, consisting primarily of high molecular weight hydrocarbons, sulfur, and trace amounts of vanadium and nickel. In addition to barium, other metals that are commonly found in water-based drilling mud are arsenic, chromium, cadmium, copper, mercury, lead, nickel, vanadium, and zinc; and caustic is added for pH control (Neff 2005, page 12). GSI did not adequately discuss the chemicals that could be present in drilling mud at the oilfield sites. The initial investigations of contamination should not be limited to barium sulfate and TPH and should at a minimum include the constituents listed on GSI Table E.1.\"\n\nAs Ecuador noted in its Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 86: \"GSI's testing of pits was limited to taking leachate samples at 7 sites, none of which included pits known to contain oil-based mud [GSI 1st, Table D.12.A]. But GSI only tested the samples for Table 7B of RAOHE, i.e., the most permissive criteria for lined pits. Had GSI compared its results against Table 7A (for unlined pits), it would have concluded that three out of seven locations (i.e., 43%) failed the test. Given the available evidence, including Perenco's own prior practice (e.g., at Jaguar 9 and Coca 19 [IEMS 3rd, Attachment 11 and GSI 2nd, Appendix B.3.1]), GSI should have applied Table 7A of RAOHE.\"\n\nAnnex E to IEMS ER II, Inspecting Report No. 06-037, Provincial Council of Orellana, Environment Department [Emphasis added].\n\n505.\n\nIt may be that this particular pit was closed prior to Perenco's assuming its operatorship and therefore Perenco bears no responsibility for it under the then-applicable fault-based regime. The Tribunal refers to the document simply to underscore the point that the evidence appears to indicate that some of the mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 contain more than water-based drilling muds and cuttings. This point was explored with Mr. Connor during his cross-examination:\n\nQ. Okay. Now, if you go to--if you stay on the first page, do you see that this is an Inspection Report; correct?\n\nA. Yes, it is.\n\nQ. Dated 4 October 2006; correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. And so--I mean, we can understand that this is the same complaint that IEMS was referring to when it identified the REC relating to Coca 8; right?\n\nA. It's part of \"Consejo Provincial de Orellana.\"\n\nQ. And it's dated 4 October 2006, which\u2014\n\nA. Is that the same--I don't recall--oh, yes, that was date that was in the other one. Yes. I would presume it's the same.\n\nQ. Okay. Now, if you look at the last paragraph--or second-to-the-last paragraph, it says that \"On 21 September 2006 at 10:00 a.m., people\"\u2014 and you have the people who attended are identified earlier went to Coca 8, and you see at the platform of Coca 8 there is a closed pit from where crude oil is coming out of the surface, 10:15 a.m. Now, we agree, just so that there is no confusion, Coca 8--the only closed pits in Coca 8 were to the south of the platform; correct?\n\nA. That's correct.\n\nQ. Okay. So we're talking about a southern pit here. So as of 21 September 2006, there is an inspection reporting that crude oil is coming out to the surface of a closed pit on Coca 8; correct?\n\nA. That's right. That's what it says here, yes.\n\nQ. And now when you turn the page.--will get to a page where we have a table with lab results. So, I'd like you to first look at the paragraph immediately above that table. And I will try my best for the translation. It says, \"Finally, when the drilling was finished, the clean layer was moved from a nearby large extension of agricultural soil in order to close the pits that were filled with oil, and the pits that contained water were left open and filled with water. With time, oil has started to come out in the slopes near the platforms. Before the drilling, the slopes had clear water and the soil was hard rock, but has now been turned into swamps that cannot be used.\"\n\nA. I see that.\n\nQ. Okay. So, all of this is after the drilling was done and the pits were closed; correct?\n\nA. This record that's been put here by an inspector is after the pits have been closed.\n\nQ. So, there's at least an indication here that, gee, maybe the pit is actually leaking; correct?\n\nA. That's what the person says. It's not--I don't think that's consistent with the true conditions of that pit.\n\nQ. Okay. We're going to see that. Now, as part of your First Expert Report, you eliminated several RECs that were identified by IEMS, including all of those relating to pits because you considered that pits were \"accepted and appropriate practices for operations.\" Correct?\n\nA. Yes, that's because they are.1061\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1772-1775 (Testimony of GSI).\n\n506.\n\nHaving made these observations about general questions arising out of the mud pits, the Tribunal turns to the applicable standards.\n\n507.\n\nPits without bottom sealing are governed by RAOHE Table 7(a), while sealed pits are governed by the less stringent RAHOE Table 7(b). The limits of permissible contents differ. For ease of reference, the Tribunal sets out an image of the translated Table 7, Annex 2, of RAOHE as provided by Ecuador:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 7 a) WITHOUT impermeabilization of the base | **1062** |  |\n| Parameter | Expressed in | Unit | Permissible limit value |\n| Hydrogen potential | pH | \u2014 | 6 |\n| Electrical conductivity | CE | uS/cm | 4,000 |\n| Total hydrocarbons | TPH | mg/1 | <1 |\n| Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) | C | mg/1 | <0,003 |\n| Cadmium | Cd | mg/1 | <0.05 |\n| Total chromium | Cr | mg/1 | <1.0 |\n| Vanadium | V | mg/1 | <0.2 |\n| Barium Ba b) WITH impermeabilization of the base | mg/1 | <5 |\n| Parameter | Expressed in | Unit | Permissible limit value |\n| Hydrogen potential | pH | \u2014 | 4 |\n| Electrical conductivity | CE | uS/cm | 8,000 |\n| Total hydrocarbons | TPH | mg/1 | <50 |\n| Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) | C | mg/1 | <0,005 |\n| Cadmium | Cd | mg/1 | <0.5 |\n| Total chromium | Cr | mg/1 | <10.0 |\n| Vanadium | V | mg/1 | <2 |\n| Barium | Ba | mg/1 | <10 |\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, p 58 (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\n508.\n\nGSI excluded from its investigation samples taken by IEMS from within closed pits for the purpose of determining the existence of soil contamination because their closure was \"specifically authorized and required under applicable Ecuador regulations (*Acuerdo* 621, Decree 2982, and RAOHE Decree 1215) and the government-approved Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for oilfield operations in the Consortium area.\"1063 In its view, IEMS treated these samples, and by extension the contents of closed pits, which are areas specially construed to hold the by-products of the drilling process, as if they were regular soil.1064 According to Perenco, this represented 22% of the 22,629 samples IEMS collected in its first sampling campaign.1065\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 181(1); Reply, paragraph 73\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 313-333; relying on GSI ER I, paragraphs 108-110; Rejoinder, paragraphs 98, 128-140\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 316; GSI ER I, section 3.7, Appendix F.4, Appendix D, Table D.3.\n\n509.\n\nAn examination of Tables 6 and 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE suggests that there was a deliberate decision by the regulator to separate the treatment of \"leachates for the final storage of surface drilling muds and rubbles\" from the treatment more generally of soil that may have been affected during the course of the hydrocarbon production process. As noted above, a mud-pit is a specific containment method for these by-products of the drilling process, which tend to take the form of a combination of drilling muds and formation water which is dried and treated (using substances such as aluminium sulfate and calcium hydroxide), mixed with solids, and then compacted and stored in the pits. In this light, it is understandable that RAOHE should treat the one separately from the other, and would contemplate contaminant levels greater than that applied more generally to soil which is not as directly affected by the hydrocarbon production process as a mud pit.\n\n510.\n\nThe significance of the difference in treatment is confirmed, for example, by the fact that drilling muds commonly contain heavy metals such as barium, which is addressed in Table 7, Annex 2, of RAOHE along with chromium and vanadium, but is not identified as a contaminant of concern in Table 6, Annex 2, of RAOHE. The Tribunal notes that Table 7 of RAOHE in fact addresses a number of elements that are not addressed in Table 6 of RAOHE: hydrogen, electrical conductivity, total chromium, vanadium and barium, and in this way it is more comprehensive in addressing the kinds of chemicals that might be produced in the by-products of the drilling process and stored in a mud pit.\n\n511.\n\nMoreover, RAOHE Table 6 sets out concentrations in mg/kg, compared to Table 7, which provides concentration limits in mg/l.1066 Again, this reflects the concern with mud pits, which is not with contaminants in the material contained within the pit because that is a given at some concentration, but rather with the potential for their contents to leach such contaminants into surrounding soil and underground water sources in concentrations that pose a threat to the environment.1067 This explains the choice to provide a higher set of permitted substances for sealed pits in Table 7(b) as opposed to that for unsealed pits. The latter pose a greater risk for discharges of substances that contain contaminants at environmentally damaging concentrations.\n\nSee above at paragraph 90.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 324.\n\n512.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered and takes into account the evidence of the use of the Table 7 criteria in the investigation of the mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21, whether initiated by the operator and not objected to by the Ecuadorian authorities when brought to their attention, or by IEMS in its report in the *City Oriente* proceedings. The 2002 pit closure report for pits in Payamino 24 describes leachates analysis of samples having regard to Table 7 of RAOHE.1068 They confirmed that the fluid inside the pits complied with the permissible limits for barium, chromium, cadmium, vanadium and TPH set forth in Table 7.1069 The 2006 and 2008 environmental audits applied Table 7 of RAOHE.1070 The 2003 environmental report on specific sites in Block 21 (such as Yuralpa Centro 1 pit) applied Table 7 of RAOHE.1071\n\nExhibit CE-CC-40, Final Report on Closure Work for the Payamino 24 Mud Pits, February 2002, pp 20-21.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nSee, for e.g., exhibit CE-CC-182/E-144, 2008 Block 7 Audit, pp 67-68.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-213, Compilation of the Consortium's annual environmental reports for Blocks 7 and 21, pp 51, 61.\n\n513.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that some of the evidence of the application of Table 7 of RAOHE to pits in the Blocks is in the form of pit closure reports produced by the operator. As noted above, one of Ecuador's objections to the applicability of Table 7, Annex 2, of RAOHE was its submission that Table 7 applied strictly to the sealing of a pit and to investigate whether it has been properly sealed (hence, the periodic sampling seven days, three months, and six months after storage). It was limited to a specific context and period of time.\n\n514.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that Ecuador has not made this aspect of its case out. Two factors militate in favour of the finding that Table 7 remains the applicable regulatory criteria to testing the environmental compliance of mud pits. The first is that there is no indication in Table 7 that at the six-month mark, some other set of regulatory criteria supersedes Table 7. A review of the sections and other annexes of RAOHE similarly does not offer a clear and suitable alternative. Ecuador's position is that this would be RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6.1072 However, as set out above, the nature of the contaminants that may \u2018leach' from the material compacted and stored in mud pits has been addressed in Table 7, and it does not appear that the same can be said for Table 6. In this sense, Table 7 presents the regulatory standard that is more specifically aimed at the protection of the environment in the case of mud pits.\n\nIEMS ER III, p 27; see also, Ecuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 305 cf. Claimant's CounterMemorial, paragraphs 318-321, Section II.A.2(a).\n\n515.\n\nThe second point is that Table 7 requires periodic sampling precisely because the effect of \u2018leaching' presents itself over time and it is concerned with catching the development and accumulation of seeping substances. To turn the six-month mark into a six-month cut-off would seem to undercut this imperative. In the absence of a regulatory prescription to apply a different set of criteria after six months, the Tribunal is of the view that it accords with the purpose of Table 7 to continue to apply it to determine the regulatory compliance of the mud pits in the Blocks.\n\n516.\n\nAs regards the question of the appropriate testing method, the Tribunal considers that this is addressed in the title and opening paragraphs of RAOHE Table 7. The title refers to permissible limits for leachates for the \"final disposal of drilling muds and cuttings on the surface\".1073 It does not state that it prescribes the permissible limits for the content of the storage of surface drilling muds and rubbles. Its opening paragraph states that \"[t]he sampling shall be performed so as to obtain representative composite samples as a function of total volume disposed of at the respective site.\"1074 Thus, any \"leachate testing\" should take into account this directive in the regulation and ensure it is representative of the bounds and underlying surface area of the pit, that is, the area from which leaching may occur.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Table 7 (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n517.\n\nThus, the Tribunal finds that the appropriate regulatory criteria and leachate testing methodology that should be applied to the testing of mud pits is contained in Table 7, Annex 2, of RAOHE.\n\n518.\n\nAs to the mechanics of sampling for leachates, the Tribunal notes that one of IEMS' objections to GSI's approach to testing was its allegedly \u2018convenient' delineation of the size and bounds of the pits in order to avoid finding contamination. IEMS alleged that GSI presented the pits as being larger than they actually are so as to give the impression they were not leaking.1075 The logic was that leachates were unlikely be detected around the pit if one sampled soil well away from the pit's actual perimeter. This is not something that the Tribunal is in a position to decide at present, but if GSI's sampling did not occur at a sufficiently close proximity to the pits, that would undermine the validity of its findings.\n\nReply, paragraphs 94-95; IEMS ER III, section 3.2.4.\n\n519.\n\nFor its part, GSI challenged IEMS for treating closed mud pits, and in particular their contents, as subject to the criteria and the testing methodology applicable in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6, rather than that which applies to the testing of leachates in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 7.1076 As already noted, Ecuador submitted that Table 7 was intended to apply only in the immediate aftermath of sealing the contents of a pit.1077 Perenco responded to this assertion that there was nothing in Table 7 or otherwise in RAOHE that supports such a reading of the approach under Ecuadorian law.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 318-321, Section II.A.2(a).\n\nIEMS ER III, p 27; see also, Ecuador's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 305.\n\n520.\n\nThe Tribunal has already disposed of Ecuador's view that soil samples taken from *within* mud pits should be treated as if they were taken from soil from the Blocks' general terrain that may or may have been affected by hydrocarbon operations. However, the Tribunal does not see anything wrong with testing the contents of mud pits to see if the operator deposited substances that should not have been deposited in them. The contents of such pits will by definition differ from the surrounding environment. So long as they do not contain substances that should not have been deposited in the first place, they are properly constructed, and their contents meet the relevant Ecuadorian standard, mud pits are deemed to be an acceptable by-product of oilfield operations in Ecuador.\n\n521.\n\nTurning to the third and last issue in relation to the investigation of mud pits, as noted above, Table 7 distinguishes between the criteria that should apply to sealed and unsealed pits. This refers to whether the bottom of the pit is \u2018sealed', a term that is used in Tables 7(a) and 7(b). In Perenco's view, Table 7(b) applied to the pits constructed by it in Blocks 7 and 21.1078 In Ecuador's view, IEMS' evidence demonstrates that there is \"no evidence of intact permeable liners beneath [the] pits\" in Blocks 7 and 21.1079\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 138-140; 1st Witness Statement of Wilfrido Saltos, paragraph 185.\n\nReply, paragraphs 92-93; RPS ER II, section 5, pp 81-83; IEMS ER III, section 3.2.2.\n\n522.\n\nThere is some evidence that the bottoms of some of the pits were not lined or their liners had seriously deteriorated.1080 RPS submitted that four of the seven pits that GSI tested should more properly be subjected to Table 7(a) limits and it raised instances where the operator applied Table 7(a) limits of its own volition rather than Table 7(b) in pit closure procedures, such as in Jaguar 9 in November 2000 and in Coca 19 in October 2004 (when Perenco was operator).1081 RPS also noted that the TCLP analyses of materials buried at certain closed pits that GSI tested \"show concentrations of barium above the applicable standards for pit closure at three of the seven pits investigated [by GSI]. A fourth pit also fails to meet the applicable closure criteria based on a soil pH that is out of the allowable range.\"1082\n\nEcuador noted in its Post-Hearing Brief (paragraph 92): \"The statements from Perenco's former field employees in relation to pits are telling. For example, when asked whether pits could be leaking, Perenco's Block 7 Maintenance Supervisor and Superintendent (Marco Ram\u00edrez) explained that *\"[t]he lyner (sic) lacked maintenance.* *Cracked by the high temperatures of formation water and [was] damaged by the chemical products The lyner* *cristalizes [sic] and leaks. The pits never received maintenance [...]\"* [IEMS 3rd, Attachment 17]. Similarly, Perenco's Roads and Platforms Construction Supervisor (C\u00e9sar Andrade) explained that prior to construction of pits *\"[g]eological and hydrological studies were not performed* \" [IEMS 3rd, Attachment 17]. Both reported that they know of people affected by leaks in pits at Coca 4, Payamino 1, Oso A, and Gacela 2. GSI had this information and yet did not sample any of the pits at these locations.\"\n\nReply, paragraphs 92-93; RPS ER III, section 5, pp 81-83; IEMS ER III, section 3.2.2.\n\nRPS ER III, p 83.\n\n523.\n\nOn the Tribunal's instruction, in their post-hearing briefs the Parties attached tables they had prepared summarising the evidence of their respective experts on each pit and their observations on whether Table 7(a) or Table 7(b) should more appropriately be applied in specific instances.1083 It notes pit closure reports on the record which present examples of Perenco's use of Table 7(a) with regard to specific pits: Oso 4-5 in November 2004, Coca 19 in October 2004 and one pit in Jaguar 9 in the 2008 audit.1084 There are similarly instances where it applied Table 7(b): C\u00f3ndor Norte 1 in November 2005, two pits in Yuralpa Pad A closed in June 2003 and May 2004.1085 The Tribunal notes Perenco's submission that where Table 7(a) was applied it does not necessarily denote that the pit was unlined because \"Table 7A was at times used out of an abundance of caution even in cases of pits that were very clearly lined.\"1086\n\nAnnex 1 to Ecuador's Post-Hearing Brief and Appendix A to Perenco's Reply Post-Hearing Brief.\n\nExhibits E-371, Pit closure report for Oso 4-5; E-271, \" *Reporte de taponamiento de piscinas de Coca 19*,\" dated October 2004.\n\nExhibits E-366, Pit closure report and pit diagram for Condor Norte, PERPROD0029388; E-375, Pit closure report for Yuralpa Centro 1 and 2; E-300, *\"Taponamiento de piscinas de perforaci\u00f3n - Yuralpa Centro 2 y Yuralpa Centro 1, Informe de trabajo por administraci\u00f3n directa,\"* dated April - May 2004.\n\nSee Appendix A to Perenco's Reply Post-Hearing Brief, item no. 12, (Perenco's comments).\n\n524.\n\nBe that as it may, the Tribunal agrees with RPS that GSI's use of Table 7(b) is inconsistent with the Consortium's own practice of applying Table 7(a) in some instances. RPS submitted that if GSI had applied Table 7(a) limits, it would have concluded that 4 of the 7 pits that GSI had tested should be remediated.1087\n\nRPS ER III, section 5, pp 82-83.\n\n525.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that there is a need to proceed cautiously with respect to the approach that should be adopted in order to determine whether Table 7(a) or 7(b) should apply in the analysis of leachate samples. It considers that because of the risk that an unlined pit or a pit whose lining has deteriorated over time poses to the environment, where there is any doubt as to whether a pit is sealed, or where there may have been a deterioration of the lining, the more environmentally protective standard in Table 7(a) should be used.\n\n**(4.1) Conclusion on the Mud Pits Issues**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n526.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal's conclusions on the mud-pit issues are as follows:\n\n(a) Table 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE provides the applicable technical standard.\n\n(b) Perenco has no obligation to dig up and remediate properly constructed and confined mud pits whose contents do not exceed the applicable regulatory standard.\n\n(c) At the same time, it was not improper for IEMS to sample the contents of closed mud pits to determine whether or not they exceeded the permissible tolerances contained in Table 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE or contained substances that should not have been deposited in the first place.1088\n\n(d) Drilling muds and cuttings are properly disposed of under the current regime if: (i) they are placed in proper pits as required by law; (ii) the operator properly treated the contents of the pits so as to ensure that it did not deposit muds and cuttings that contained analytes in quantities in excess of the applicable regulations or other substances that should not have been desposited therein; (iii) the pits have been properly covered and closed; (iv) such pits are constructed with proper berms and at grade; and (v) that soil sampling at places around the pits shows no sign of leaching.\n\n(e) As to whether regard should be had to Table 7(a) or 7(b), if a pit has an impermeable liner, Table 7(b) applies. Conversely, if there is no impermeable liner, Table 7(a) applies. The Appendix A to Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief on Counterclaims, Schedule of Closed Pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, shows that the Parties continue to have substantial disagreements as to whether or not certain pits have been closed with impermeable liners. This will be the subject of further investigation (as to which see below). In any case of doubt, the more environmentally protective standard set out in Table 7(a) shall be applied.\n\nIt has already been determined that it is not relevant to the disposition of this claim to test the content of mud pits against background values (see above at paragraphs 292-323).\n\n**(5) Groundwater remediation**\n-------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nThe Parties and their experts were also deeply divided on the matter of testing groundwater contamination, disagreeing on the applicable regulatory criteria and the proper testing methods.\n\n528.\n\nIn addition, the groundwater issue became subsumed in a dispute over certain evidence beginning with Perenco's filing with its Rejoinder a statement from Mr. Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, a former employee of IEMS who left the company on poor terms.\n\n529.\n\nAfter he left IEMS' employ on 6 September 2011, Mr. Mart\u00ednez contacted the Claimant's counsel and volunteered to assist Perenco.1089 His witness statement spurred considerable correspondence and the filing of further evidence leading up the oral hearing.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 7, pp 2044-2045 (Testimony of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez). Mr. Mart\u00ednez initially stated that he submitted his resum\u00e9 to Debevoise & Plimpton \"when I had just left the company, IEMS.\" He then amended his answer. \"Q. But, sir, you have just told me that you submitted that CV to Debevoise as soon as you left IEMS; isn't that the case? A. Well, it wasn't the following day. It was a few months after that.\" Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 7, p 2046 (Testimony of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez).\n\n530.\n\nMr. Mart\u00ednez testified that he worked on the Ecuador project starting with a visit from 25 October to 26 November 2010. He led one of IEMS' sampling brigades which collected soil, surface water and groundwater samples.1090 He also interviewed local inhabitants about any environmental problems, met with Environment Ministry officials who informed IEMS about potential contamination, and directed his brigade to sample in locations where they thought they might find environmental harm.1091 Mr. Mart\u00ednez testified that when he arrived in the oilfields, he \"immediately noticed that the fields were in good shape\" and \"in comparison to other fields that I have visited, Blocks 7 and 21 looked clean and healthy to me.\"1092\n\nWitness Statement of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, paragraph 10.\n\nWitness Statement of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, paragraph 11.\n\nWitness Statement of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, paragraph 18.\n\n531.\n\nMr. Mart\u00ednez visited Ecuador again, this time from 1 to 22 August 2011 to resample certain areas based on the first field campaign's results. He asserted that he was demoted for the second visit because he had told his supervisors that he disagreed with the way in which samples were being taken. Rather than running a brigade, his role was to take data on the physical characteristics of the soil, i.e., colour, smell, texture, grain size, moisture and presence of hydrocarbon per sample and depth.1093\n\nWitness Statement of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, paragraph 13.\n\n532.\n\nHe described IEMS' work as \"being conducted in a rushed and chaotic way\" and beyond IEMS' capacity. He said that he became increasingly concerned about the company's motives and alleged that management seemed to be making obtaining favourable results more important than maintaining integrity and professionalism. He claimed that IEMS' Mr. Rub\u00e9n Villanueva said that they would be rewarded with a trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and to good restaurants in Quito \"for our good work, provided we reach the goal\" of finding pollution. In Coca, at an IEMS-only meeting, Mr. Villanueva was alleged to have called Jos\u00e9 Francisco Alfaro, Eric Torres and Gilberto Mart\u00ednez and to have told them that \"IEMS had to continue receiving this type of assignment from Ecuador\" and further that \"the main objective of the Blocks 7 and 21 project was to find - at all costs - hydrocarbons in the soil, surface water and groundwater.\"1094\n\nWitness Statement of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, paragraph 21.\n\n533.\n\nMr. Mart\u00ednez said that they were instructed to take samples from mud pits and to treat the area as if it was normal soil, which \"seemed absurd\" to him.1095 He added that IEMS \"did not use proper equipment or procedures for sampling groundwater\" and that groundwater monitoring wells were installed using a hand-threaded pipe rather than a machine-threaded pipe which would have prevented the clogging of filters. He said that his recommendation to use machine-threaded pipes was ignored. He added that because of the defective way in which the monitoring wells were put together, they did not capture any groundwater and came out dry and this led to the \"rather astonishing practice\", which he said one of his colleagues told him about, whereby IEMS employees poured river water into the pipes to take the sample. He said that he saw this with his own eyes during his second visit and considered this to be a \"scandalous breach of the sampling protocol\" which he reported to Mr. Alfaro who, he said, told him that if he wanted to keep his job he should not ask questions or make such comments.1096\n\nWitness Statement of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, paragraph 23.\n\nWitness Statement of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, paragraphs 21-27.\n\n534.\n\nMr. Mart\u00ednez also described IEMS' failure to take the necessary steps to adequately define areas of contamination and its errors in analysing laboratory results. He said that he proposed that they follow ASTM protocols for sampling in order to be impartial and to avoid any possible problems for the company or future complaints about its integrity, but that Mr. Villanueva explained \"that the purpose of the project was to find contamination so that the operator would lose its case against Ecuador.\" He recounted Mr. Villanueva's saying that \"that was why IEMS was hired and why I should not ask questions.\"1097\n\nWitness Statement of Gilberto Mart\u00ednez, paragraphs 59-61.\n\n535.\n\nThese were serious allegations and called for a response. Ecuador was granted leave to file responsive evidence. IEMS therefore filed a \"Supplemental Expert Report\" (which also responded to Dr. Rouhani's report also filed with the Rejoinder). The Report described Mr. Mart\u00ednez's account of his work with the company as \"for the most part fictitious\", described him as an \"unreliable employee\" who \"engaged in unacceptable conduct\" which led to his dismissal.1098 It cited an 8 August 2011 email of complaint from Mr. Villanueva. Mr. Mart\u00ednez was said to have habitually arrived late at work, \"often in an unsuitable state\" and to have slept on the job whilst in Ecuador.1099 IEMS added that whilst the second sampling campaign was underway in August 2011 it was decided to terminate his employment. He was so informed upon his return to Mexico. He refused to accept the sum fixed by the company for a justified termination. A settlement was concluded on 6 September 2011.1100 IEMS asserted that his account of his leaving the company was \"wholly fabricated.\"1101\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 6.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 6.\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 6.\n\n536.\n\nAccording to IEMS, Mr. Mart\u00ednez never mentioned any of the preoccupations contained in his witness statement and any claims to the contrary were false. IEMS denied that its instructions were to find evidence of contamination at all costs. The alleged promise of a trip to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands if contamination was found was a \"particularly absurd fabrication.\"1102 The allegations concerning the use of certain equipment were incorrect. In particular, the allegation that water was poured into the monitoring wells to pass it off as groundwater samples was \"mendacious\" and was never approved.1103 The problem of dry wells was solved not by pouring water into the wells, but rather by \"digging deeper, as shown by the email correspondence with Gilberto Mart\u00ednez himself.\"1104\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 7.\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 7. This last point was said to have been corroborated by Mr. Mauricio Naranjo, a local professional who coordinated a group of local experts, some of whom participated in groundwater sampling. IEMS filed in this regard an email from Mr. Naranjo, the Ecuadorian contractor who assisted IEMS in the groundwater sampling campaign, to Mr. Alfaro, who said that with respect to: \"...the water samples from the monitoring wells, I must tell you that neither the workers not my personnel have mentioned that samples were taken from the river. However, they have been monitoring wells that were placed near the watercourses and in the flood zones, which were lost because it was impossible to sample them, making it necessary to drill more wells, and in some cases the well was lost.\" Exhibit E-354, Email dated 9 August 2013 from Mauricio Fernando Naranjo Viscarra to Jos\u00e9 Francisco Alfaro.\n\nIEMS ER IV, pp 7-8 (IEMS attached email correspondence between Mr. Mart\u00ednez and his superiors during the August 2011 campaign showing that this was a topic of discussion between them.).\n\n537.\n\nIEMS questioned how Mr. Mart\u00ednez would be in a position to be able to \"immediately\" determine whether an oilfield was \"in good shape\" or whether it looked \"clean and healthy\" because the verification and characterisation of contamination \"cannot be done without a careful process of sampling and laboratory analysis.\"1105 His experience was \"at best, extremely limited\"; he had joined the company from university and \"he had never worked on an oilfield before. In all probability, the first time he ever visited one was in Ecuador.\"1106\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 8.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n538.\n\nFinally, IEMS considered it strange to be criticised for employing the background values criteria when the instruction to do so came from counsel. In any case, Mr. Mart\u00ednez had already left IEMS before its second expert report (in which background values were applied) was presented. IEMS also recalled that Mr. Mart\u00ednez had specifically suggested applying the \"sensitive ecosystem\" criteria since most of the area belonged to the Amazonian forest.1107\n\nIEMS ER IV, p 8.\n\n539.\n\nThe more serious issue from the Tribunal's perspective stemmed from the fact that IEMS' response to Mr. Mart\u00ednez's statement also included the filing of documents which Perenco's experts assert were manipulated.\n\n540.\n\nThe first such document was a Confidentiality Agreement which was said to have been found in IEMS' employment records. This prompted an assertion by Perenco that the document was a forgery.1108 Mr. Mart\u00ednez denied ever signing the document and asserted that his signature was cut and pasted from his actual employment contract.1109 His evidence that his signature had been cut and pasted on the Confidentiality Agreement was supported by the expert report of Mr. Joseph Parker.1110\n\nA letter from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP dated 26 August 2013 questioned the authenticity of the confidentiality agreement.\n\nSee letter from Debevoise & Plimpton LLP dated 26 August 2013, p 2.\n\nLetter of Joseph Parker and Attachments dated 26 August 2013.\n\n541.\n\nIEMS responded with a witness statement from its Material and Human Resources Administrator, Ms. Laura D\u00edaz de la Garza, who explained what she had done both when Mr. Mart\u00ednez had been hired and when she was asked to gather information pertaining to his employment at IEMS in order to respond to his witness statement. She said that she sent copies of the confidentiality agreement and code of ethics that comprised Exhibit E-355.1111 She noted further:\n\nI understand that two electronic files containing Gilberto Mart\u00ednez's confidentiality agreement, one dating from July 2008, and the second one from July 2009, were found in the draft confidentiality agreement folder, among the electronic files kept by IEMS. These Word documents show that Gilberto Mart\u00ednez's signature is indeed electronic. I understand that these documents have been analyzed by an IT expert in order to verify their date. It is usual for IEMS engineers and technical personnel to use electronic signatures in the reports sent to clients or various authorities throughout the Republic, which is why it is possible that Mr. Mart\u00ednez proceeded this way when signing his confidentiality agreement. Unfortunately, I do no keep [sic] emails from 2008 or 2009 in order to confirm this last statement.1112\n\nWitness Statement of Laura D\u00edaz de la Garza, paragraph 15.\n\nWitness Statement of Laura D\u00edaz de la Garza, paragraph 18.\n\n542.\n\nThe expert to whom Ms. Di\u00e1z referred was Dr. Jean-Louis Courteaud, an expert retained by Ecuador to respond to the document modification allegations. Dr. Courteaud examined the two Word documents and concluded that there was no inconsistency in the metadata of the Word documents.1113\n\nExpert Report of Dr. Jean-Louis Courteaud, p 5.\n\n543.\n\nThis did not resolve the problems associated with the electronic documents that IEMS had produced. Perenco was given access to the electronic files and shortly thereafter filed an expert report from Mr. Rich Hoffman on the meta-data associated with the signature on the documents to support the view that those documents had been manipulated as well.1114 Mr. Hoffman observed that although Dr. Courteaud had looked at the metadata associated with the Word documents, he had not looked at the separate metadata associated with the embedded JPG files. \"That metadata shows the creation date and the software used to make or modify the image. In this case some of the potentially relevant metadata is: Adobe Photoshop elements 8.0 Windows 2013:08:27 10:55:36 CST.\"1115 This led him to opine that \".the images of the signatures appearing in the two documents were created very recently, on August 27, 2013. That is just one day before Mr. Courteaud, according to his letter, accessed these documents.\"1116 Mr. Hoffman noted further that \"the signatures were created in Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0. That version of the software was released on September 23, 2009 - which was 14 months after the first document's \u2018date last saved' that appears in the document metadata.\" Documents that were genuinely \"last saved\" in 2008 and 2009 \"cannot include images that were created on software that did not exist at that time, much less images that were in fact created over four years later in August 2013 according to the image metadata of the JPG files.\"1117 He concluded that the \u2018last saved' dates that appeared in the metadata that Mr. Courteaud examined were \"false.\"1118\n\nExpert Report of Mr. Rich Hoffman, p 2.\n\nExpert Report of Mr. Rich Hoffman, pp 3-4.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nExpert Report of Mr. Rich Hoffman, p 4.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n544.\n\nAt the oral hearing, Dr. Courteaud made a short presentation, but due to Ecuador's failure to submit additional expert evidence by 4 September 2013 as contemplated in its correspondence with the Tribunal, as well as Perenco's objection to Dr. Courteaud's introducing new evidence responsive to Mr. Hoffman's report based on tests performed on a disc that was delivered to him prior to the hearing but not disclosed to Perenco, the Tribunal ruled that he could address Mr. Hoffman's expert report but could not introduce any new evidence based on more recent studies of the data.1119\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 3, p 839 (Statement of President of Tribunal): \"I wish to make clear to Mr. Courteaud that he can comment only on Mr. Hoffman's Report or to provide comments on his own Report, but he is to proceed as he never saw the disc which was delivered to him on 3rd of September. He cannot rely on any data because this disc and the data there were not provided to Perenco and the Expert retained by Perenco. So, this data are for the moment unverifiable to Perenco, and Perenco's Experts in particular.\"\n\n545.\n\nDr. Courteaud did not take issue with much of Mr. Hoffman's opinion, but he described his view as being \"more nuanced\" as regards the conclusions and the analysis. In view of the Tibunal's ruling, he did not elaborate upon the point.1120 The Tribunal was thus left with a hint of an explanation from Ecuador's expert, but no further explication due to its ruling as to the propriety of adducing new expert evidence on direct examination. There is little more to be said on this particular point.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 3, pp 863-864 (Testimony of Jean-Louis Courteaud).\n\n546.\n\nAt the hearing, Ms. Di\u00e1z denied any involvement in manipulating the documents or knowing who might have done so.1121 Her testimony did not rule out the possibility that someone else did alter the electronic files.1122 When the IEMS experts testified, each denied having instructed anyone to alter the documents or otherwise having anything to do with such an act.1123 Neither they, nor Dr. Courteaud, shed any light on the events leading up to the documents' use in this arbitration.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 3, pp 872-875, 877-885 (Testimony of Laura D\u00edaz de la Garza).\n\nPerenco's Post-Hearing Brief described its view of the situation as follows (at paragraph 92): \"Perenco confronted Ms. Laura D\u00edaz with the direct question of whether she put the electronic signature on the Word documents. She timidly answered, \"[i]t wasn't me.\" Counsel to Perenco asked Ms. D\u00edaz whether there was \u2018anybody else who knew about the forgery allegation that first arose on August 26, knew that a metadata expert would be hired and provided with data on August 28, and had access to the computer system' besides Mr. Alfaro and Mr. Villanueva, and she conceded: \u2018No one else, based on my knowledge.'\"\n\nCounsel properly put the allegations directly to the witnesses; the Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1269-1278 (Testimony of IEMS), records their exchanges. Both witnesses denied having any involvement in manipulating the documents or knowing how they might have been altered.\n\n547.\n\nThe Tribunal's view is that the weight of the evidence shows that someone at IEMS cut and pasted the signature on to the Confidentiality Agreement. If this is what was done, it was unacceptable.\n\n548.\n\nThe question is what to do about it. It is clear that Ecuador's counsel had no involvement in this and were taken by surprise. They have conducted this proceeding in good faith and in a professional manner and no imputation of wrongdoing can be made against them for having received documents and submitted them as evidence. The Tribunal is reluctant to find that the IEMS witnesses who appeared before it and denied any knowledge of the handling of the electronic files were untruthful. They too seemed confused by this turn of events. But the Tribunal must record its view that the evidence strongly points in the direction of misconduct by a person or persons affiliated with IEMS.\n\n549.\n\nThe question is whether this taints the whole of IEMS' evidence. The Tribunal considers that it does not. IEMS has made some important points and it would be unfair to Ecuador to dismiss the totality of expert evidence prepared over the course of three years on the basis of what appears to be an unethical act of perhaps a single individual.\n\n550.\n\nThe Tribunal was invited to find that the evidence as a whole corroborates Mr. Mart\u00ednez's testimony. The Tribunal does not agree. It found him to be a non-responsive witness who clearly bears a strong animus towards his former employer. He provided details as to the number of times that he met with counsel and the amount he estimated that he was paid by Perenco to appear as a witness only when pressed by the Tribunal's President and even then he was vague. These aspects of the witness' demeanour, his seeking out Perenco's counsel to provide evidence against his former employer soon after arriving at a settlement with it, and the animus between him and IEMS leads the Tribunal to treat his evidence with caution.\n\n551.\n\nOf particular note, while he claimed that Mr. Villanueva told him and two other colleagues that \"the main objective of the Blocks 7 and 21 project was to find - at all costs -hydrocarbons in the soil, surface water and groundwater\", and that he raised his concerns first in mid-November 2010 and then while the August 2011 sampling campaign was underway, the contemporaneous email exchanges during the midst of the latter campaign do not corroborate this. Exhibits E-347 to E-351 contain no evidence of reservations on Mr. Mart\u00ednez's part as to the conduct of the campaign. To the contrary, he was seeking to explain why his team had been so slow in drilling wells. There is an email from Mr. Villenueva expressing his unhappiness with the lack of progress, but nothing in it suggests that he was driving the team to act unprofessionally. Rather, it supports IEMS' present account of its disillusionment with Mr. Mart\u00ednez's work. In an 8 August 2012 email to Mr. Mart\u00ednez, Mr. Villenueva noted:\n\n\"I have just learned that we have not done any wells, and this did not make me at all happy. According to what I had discussed with you, this was one of your priorities, I suggest that you establish the leadership that I expect from someone with your experience, and support the team in order to perform the work.\".\n\n552.\n\nMr. Mart\u00ednez replied four days later:\n\n\"I thank you for your trust and the expectations placed on me, and please know that what has been asked of me has been carried out, within my status of engineer, but not of project director. However, for the success of this great project (which is one of the most important as you have let me know earlier), you have 100% of my commitment as a professional and as a person, and that is how it has been since my arrival, as my sampling team is most energetic, and has done the furthest and heaviest platforms, without diminishing the good work of all my colleagues who have fought on a daily basis in order for everything to come out well for the benefit of our company.\"1124\n\nExhibit E-349; Emails dated 8 August 2011 from Rub\u00e9n Villanueva to Gilberto Mart\u00ednez and reply from the same on 12 August 2011 [Emphasis added.]\n\n553.\n\nThe respectful and complimentary tone and content of this statement, invoking \"100%\" of Mr. Mart\u00ednez's \"commitment as a professional and as a person\" was made nine months after the first campaign (during which time, he testified, he first expressed reservations to his superiors) and two-thirds through the second campaign. Mr. Mart\u00ednez now says both campaigns were marred by intentionally misleading sampling and analyses. But his email to Mr. Villenueva, written when his time with IEMS was soon to come to an end, stands at odds with Mr. Mart\u00ednez's subsequent account of what Mr. Villanueva had allegedly instructed him to.\n\n554.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Mr. Mart\u00ednez's allegations that IEMS deliberately falsified various findings in its soil and groundwater sampling campaigns.\n\n555.\n\nNo more need be said of this part of the proceeding other than to record the Tribunal's view that it was not a \"side show\" in the hopeful words of Ecuador's counsel.1125 International arbitration cannot operate effectively without all parties acting in good faith; the duty is owed by each disputing party to the other and by each party to the Tribunal.1126\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 17; Ecuador's Reply Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 5.\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 August 2005, Part II, Chapter 1, paragraph 54; *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Preliminary Issues, 23 June 2008, paragraph 78.\n\n556.\n\nLeaving the Mart\u00ednez matter to one side, the Tribunal turns to the other differences between the Parties on the important issue of alleged groundwater contamination. IEMS collected groundwater samples from 18 sites in the Blocks.1127 It reported that all of the samples collected from these sites exhibited contamination by heavy metals (such as zinc, barium, copper, chrome, nickel) in concentrations that exceeded the regulatory limits. It compared its results to values in Table 5, Annex 1, Book VI of TULAS.1128 Ecuador submitted that TULAS obliged the operator to remedy the underground water source (and not just the groundwater in the immediate vicinity or its run-off) as well as the correspondingly affected soil if contaminants were found in concentrations above the thresholds in Table 5.1129\n\nIEMS ER I, pp 62-63; 72-73; Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 872-874; IEMS II, p 180; Supplemental Memorial, paragraphs 176, 288-289. IEMS at the time of its second report in April 2012 identified a further 52 sites it intended to investigate for possible groundwater contamination (IEMS II, p 181).\n\nIEMS ER II, p 153.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraph 805; Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 169.\n\n557.\n\nGSI criticised IEMS' sampling methods, asserting that they invalidated its findings.1130 In GSI's view, IEMS' monitoring wells did not conform to industry standards and IEMS failed to properly filter its groundwater samples, and as a result it produced values that were \"scientifically impossible.\"1131 This included the addition of nitric acid preservative to the samples in order to stabilise the dissolved metal concentrations prior to testing, which GSI submitted exponentially elevated the metal concentrations.1132 GSI also criticised IEMS for evaluating its samples under Table 5, Annex 1, Book VI of TULAS when it should have employed Annex 5 of RAOHE. As for its own samples, GSI submitted that they had been taken with proper equipment, using the correct filtration method, and the results showed that they were fully compliant with applicable regulatory limits.1133\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 9\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 79, 83, 84, 226-228; Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18, 334-340.\n\nClaimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 337-339; GSI ER I, paragraph 230; Rejoinder, paragraph 145.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraphs 86, 182 and 229 (suggests that it could not gain access to 3 of the 18 sites examined by IEMS); Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 339.\n\n558.\n\nThe Tribunal has found the whole question of filtering to be problematic. On the question of the applicable technical standards, reference to RAOHE, Article 86, shows that it applies to the following specific matters:1134\n\n**ART. 86. - Parameters**... - For liquid discharges, atmospheric emissions and disposal of solid waste to the environment, the subjects of control and their operators and related parties in the implementation of theier operations shall comply with the permissible limits specified in Annexes Nos. 1, 2 and 3 to this Regulation, which constitute the minimum program for internal environmental monitoring and shall be reported to the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection with the frequency established in Article 12 of this Regulation. Should a permissible limit established in the annexes is exceeded, this must be reported immediately to the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, and the corrective actions taken must be justified.\n\n\u2026\n\nb.2) Table No. 4: Permissible limits for waters and liquid discharges in the exploration, production, industrialization, transportation, storage and marketing of hydrocarbons and their derivatives.\n\n4.a) permissible limits at the effluent discharge point (liquid discharges).\n\n4.b) Permissible limits at the control point in the receiving body (immission)\n\nb. 3) Table No. 5: Permissible limits for discharges of black and grey waters.\n\n\u2026\n\nc) Annex 3: Parameters, maximum reference values and permissible limits for advanced environmental monitoring and control.\n\nc. 1) Parameters to be determined in the characterization of surface waters in Baseline Studies - Environmental Diagnostic.\n\nc.2) Additional parameters and permissible limits for water and liquid discharges in the exploration, production, industrialization, transportation, storage and marketing of hydrocarbons and their derivatives.\n\nc.3) Recommended parameters and reference values for water in remediated pits intended for fish farming.\n\nExhibit EL-147, RAOHE (translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\n559.\n\nPerenco views the foregoing as being the only relevant set of standards, while Ecuador argues that the RAOHE standards are concerned with the hydrocarbon exploitation process and in respect to evaluating groundwater, TULAS applies.1135\n\nReply, paragraph 166; Rejoinder, paragraph 150. Perenco also argued that if it was wrong in arguing that RAOHE alone applied, properly tested, the groundwater samples still met TULAS's standards. Rejoinder, paragraph 151.\n\n560.\n\nA review of RAOHE shows that it contains specific instances of the regulatory treatment of \" *Aguas* \" (water) and they are of limited purview to the general question of water quality. Table 4 of Annex 2 prescribes limits for the discharge of \"water and liquid\" in the hydrocarbon production process.1136 Annex 3 sets out the parameters to be determined in the development of base studies for the testing of \"surface waters.\" Table 5 provides the permissible limits for the discharge of sewage and \"grey water.\"1137 Annex 5, as described above and the regulation that Perenco invokes, is a table with three columns identifying the parameter, method of testing, and reference material with respect to water.1138 It is notable for the manner it chooses *not* to prescribe limits. It is more likely that its purpose is to provide the testing method for the parameters identified in other parts of RAOHE that do prescribe limits in the analysis of water, whether it is water discharged in the production process in Table 4 or grey water in Table 5.\n\nExhibit EL-146, RAOHE, p 55.\n\nExhibit EL-146, RAOHE, p 57.\n\nSee above at paragraph 91.\n\n561.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the particularity of RAOHE's rules shows that they clearly govern how an operator must conduct itself in relation to specific matters, for example, discharging black and grey waters, but TULAS does have a role to play in terms of evaluating the overall quality of the groundwaters that may be affected by oilfield operations as a whole. With that in mind, the purpose of Table 5, Annex 1, Book VI of TULAS, which was promulgated two years after RAOHE came into effect, is more apparent. Unlike RAOHE, TULAS identifies groundwater contamination as a regulatory concern and proceeds to prescribe the obligation to remedy contaminated groundwater and the criteria that should be applied in determining whether this obligation has been triggered.\n\n562.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to emphasise that it recognises the concern with the quality and safety of groundwater in this overarching regulation which, in the words of Perenco's expert, Dr. Bed\u00f3n, \"applie[s] in a general manner to all of those activities that may cause an impact\" on the environment.1139 The imperative of environmental protection and restoration in the 1998 and 2008 Constitutions similarly compels giving effect to this regulation. The Tribunal further notes that Article 4.1.3.6 of TULAS, which introduces Table 5, states that any alteration of the quality of groundwater triggers an obligation to remedy the \" *subterr\u00e1neas contaminadas y el suelo afectado*.\"1140 This would suggest that its objective is to restore the quality of the groundwater but also to ensure that there is little risk of a resurgence of the problem because of seepage. This, in the Tribunal's view, is the most environmentally protective approach to take to a difficult question of interpretation.\n\n1st Expert Report of Ren\u00e9 Bed\u00f3n, Appendix B, paragraph 5(a).\n\nExhibit EL-146, TULAS (translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).\n\n563.\n\nTurning to the equally contested issues of groundwater well construction and filtering. The Tribunal has reservations about both Parties' approaches to this.\n\n564.\n\nOn one hand, the Tribunal is concerned that IEMS' wells may not have been constructed to \u2018best practices' standards.1141 The variability of IEMS' sampling results from its various campaigns raises concerns in the Tribunal's mind about the reliability of its results and Perenco has persuasively pointed out both the variability of results and weaknesses in IEMS' attempts to explain those variations.1142 It appears that neither set of experts did the requisite field work to ascertain the clay content at all of the groundwater wells so as to be able to determine whether TULAS's Table 5 could be used.1143\n\nOn this point, the Tribunal takes note of GSI's and Mr. Mart\u00ednez's comments about the use of machine rather than hand-threaded pipes.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 154-156. Perenco's Post-hearing Brief (at paragraph 69) commented that \"Mr. Alfaro admitted that IEMS' most recent results, from January 2013, showed no exceedances at all in the filtered samples, and only one \u2018estimated' borderline exceedance - about which even IEMS was \u2018not certain' - in the unfiltered samples. Mr. Alfaro agreed that he could not tell from IEMS' most recent samples whether there were any exceedances, and conceded that IEMS \u2018haven't been able to find an explanation' for either their December 2012 or their January 2013 results.\" [Footnotes omitted.]\n\nOn the matter of clay content of the soil, IEMS acknowledged that a number of its monitoring wells \"may\" be located in areas where the clay content was greater than 25%, but otherwise maintained that TULAS applied to its groundwater samples (or, alternatively, more environmentally protective background values applied). (IEMS III, p 77). Perenco criticised IEMS for not conducting this testing (Perenco's Post-Hearing Brief, paragraphs 64, 68); Ecuador retorted that GSI itself had not done so either (Ecuador's Reply Post-hearing Brief, paragraph 46).\n\n565.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal has reservations about GSI's narrowing of testing and whether that led to underreporting of contaminants. As for its use of filters, if for a particular type of testing the water is not supposed to be filtered, using field filters could lead to results that report lower concentrations of contaminants than are actually present in the groundwater. The Tribunal is mindful in this regard of Ecuador's point that many local inhabitants in the Blocks consume surface water or water drawn from shallow wells. A debate about colloidal suspension skewing test results seems disconnected from reality if the combined effect of consuming unfiltered groundwater and oilfield-related colloids is to push the combined impact over tolerable and acceptable levels.1144 Even where filtering might be proper, the Tribunal is not entirely comfortable with GSI's initially sampling groundwater using a 5 micron filter and then switching to a much smaller 0.45 micron filter.1145 It is unclear to the Tribunal why GSI chose to switch to a finer filter and the concern is that employing a 0.45 pm filter might have been too restrictive.\n\nRPS opined that the use of field filters when collecting groundwater samples for the analysis of metals such as arsenic, barium and lead can result in analytical results that are biased low and should not be used as a substitute for proper sampling techniques. The concern is that colloidal-sized particles which may have contaminants absorbed onto the particles can act as transport contaminants in the groundwater. RPS pointed out that the use of filters of less than 10 pm will remove such mobile colloids down to approximately the pore size of the filter in the observed contaminants will also be removed from the groundwater samples, \"thus producing analytical results that are not truly representative of groundwater conditions.\" (RPS ER III, section 3.4).\n\nRPS's Figure 3-1 in its third expert report (p 24) showed the difference in results as between using a 5 pm filter as compared to a 0.45 pm filter, using, for example, arsenic and barium. GSI argued that some of the substances for which unfiltered samples are required pertain to substances that do not result from oilfield operations. (GSI ER II, section 6.3). Likewise, Perenco's response was that \"none of these compounds is even associated with oilfield operations.\" (Rejoinder, paragraph 152). But this seems not to accord with the evidence that barium is associated with such operations. RPS holds a different view (ER II, section 3.4, pp 24-25): \"The effect of using the 0.45 micron filter is profound when assessing the risk to human health. The concentration report for arsenic dropped from 0,023 mg/l (collected with a 5.0 micron filter), to being not detected at the detection level of 0.0033 mg/l (collected with a 0.45 micron filter)... The concentration of barium also dropped from a reported value of 0.35 mg/l using the 5.0 micron filter to 0.32 mg/l with the 0.45 micron filter.  \n On the question of whether arsenic, for example, is potentially associated with Perenco's operations, the Tribunal is not in a position to decide who is correct. It will therefore defer making a final determination. The technical issue, on which the Tribunal will, if necessary, seek additional guidance on, is whether filtering is required for all relevant tests in order to determine whether oilfield activities have caused damage to groundwater supplies in the Blocks and where it is proper to do so, what type of filter is appropriate.\n\n566.\n\nThe sensitivity of the issue is illustrated in the following positions of the Parties. Ecuador argued that:\n\n\"[RPS'] Mr. Crouch also demonstrated how GSI's use of 0.45 micron filters was completely inappropriate and biased their groundwater results.\n\nIf a filter were to be used (and it should be noted that the local population does not have special filtration systems to remove contaminants from their drinking water), the appropriate filter would be much larger than the ones used by GSI. GSI initially used a 5 micron filter, which was already excessively small, and later changed it to a 0.45 micron filter [D5:P1351:L7-P1352:L2]. Hence, while GSI's own samples taken in the Mono CPF, for example, with the 5 micron filter showed the presence of barium concentrations higher than the regulatory standards, when re testing the same location using the 0.45 micron filter GSI concluded that there were no impacts [D5:P1353:L11-P1354:L1]. GSI again gives no explanation as to why the initial results were disregarded.\"1146\n\nEcuador's Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 101. [Emphasis added.]\n\n567.\n\nTo this, Perenco replied that:\n\n...Ecuador's argument regarding the supposed bias introduced by the use of a 0.45 micron filter has no merit. As GSI explained, these filters were specifically designed for groundwater sampling to ensure the lab will test groundwater and not excess mud suspended in it. The Ecuadorian technical guidelines promulgated by INEN and referenced in TULAS even define dissolved concentrations in water as those that will pass through a 0.45 micron filter.1147\n\nPerenco's Reply Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 40.\n\n568.\n\nThe conflict between the experts demonstrates why the Tribunal considers that it must have its own expert. The importance of uncontaminated water (even if not necessarily potable without treatment1148) cannot be overstated and the Tribunal is uncomfortable with the prospect that it might err in deciding the appropriate groundwater testing protocol. This will be referred to the Tribunal's expert to examine in light of the Tribunal's determination of the appropriate technical standard.\n\nIt might be that water drawn from the surface or from shallow wells is not potable for reasons having nothing to do with oilfield operations.\n\n569.\n\nHaving regard to the foregoing, the Tribunal will instruct an independent expert to redo the groundwater sampling in accordance with the following directions. Given that both Parties' experts had ample opportunity to test for groundwater exceedances, the Tribunal's expert's sampling shall be:\n\n(i) Confined to the sampling locations identified by IEMS/GSI.\n\n(ii) At each location, new wells must be drilled in accordance with best practices.\n\n(iii) For substances covered by TULAS, Annex 1, Table 5, which the expert considers to be associated with hydrocarbon exploitation, the expert shall use the appropriate sampling technique (whether filtration or no filtration) as reflected in NTE INEN 2169:98 produced by the Ecuadorian Standardisation Institute and referred to in Section 5 of Annex 1 of TULAS.\n\n(iv) If the expert determines whether filtration is appropriate for the substances being tested, he/she shall determine what size of filter pore is appropriate.\n\n(v) The expert shall also address GSI's separation of the TPH parameter into three different parameters: Gasoline Range Organics, Diesel Range Organics and Oil Range Organics. In case of doubt as to whether a substance could be associated with oilfield operations, the expert shall test for that substance.\n\n(vi) Given the effluxion of time, in the event that the resampling results in findings of contamination in excess of applicable standards, it might be necessary to allocate responsibility for remediation as between Perenco and Petroamazonas.\n\n**E. Cost of remediation**\n--------------------------\n\n570.\n\nAnother key issue which has divided the Parties and which has an important impact on the quantum of damages concerns the estimated costs of remediation.\n\n571.\n\nEcuador submitted that once found liable Perenco is required to \"fully restore the ecosystems in Blocks 7 and 21 or pay damages to allow the State to proceed with the restoration process.\" Article 396, paragraph 2, of the 2008 Constitution is said to provide that any harm to the environment \"give[s] rise to an obligation to fully restore the ecosystems and compensate the individuals and communities affected.\"1149 Ecuador's position was that since Perenco has \"refused\" to take responsibility for restoration, it must be ordered to pay damages in lieu.1150 As the Tribunal has already found, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, an impact on the environment resulting from oilfield operations is not to be equated with an environmental harm; the harm exists in cases of regulatory exceedances, unremediated spills, poorly constructed mud pits, etc. Moreover, production in the Blocks has increased. Perenco is therefore not obliged to incur the costs of returning the Blocks to a pre-anthropogenic pristine state of nature. It must, however, pay for any remediation for which it is legally responsible, such cost of remediation to be calculated having regard to market pricing.\n\nExhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paragraphs 692-697.\n\n572.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Tribunal intends to appoint an independent expert to assist in ascertaining the environmental condition of the Blocks in accordance with the legal and factual findings made in this Decision, the Tribunal leaves to one side the extent of remediation which might be required. That depends upon the expert's resampling results. The Tribunal does consider it important to set out its views on the remediation costs issue.\n\n573.\n\nThe Parties differ on: (i) the type of remediation technology; (ii) the costs for off-site treatment; (iii) whether off-site remediation is even necessary; and (iv) the costs of transportation and backfilling and contingency and other factors.\n\n574.\n\nThe Parties and their experts differ on whether all adversely affected soils should be treated off-site.1151 GSI proposed that such soil be sent to an officially-approved soil remediation facility in the city of Coca for treatment while IEMS proposed that it is sent to an unspecified offsite bio-treatment facility.1152 They also disagreed on the treatment of soils contaminated by heavy metals; GSI proposed an on-site lined landfill, while IEMS proposed an off-site landfill.1153\n\nSee above at paragraphs 232-233, 267, 287-288.\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.6.\n\nIEMS ER III, section 3.2.6, p 73.\n\n575.\n\nSince the Tribunal has rejected IEMS' principal means of mapping contamination and has held that properly contained drilling muds need not be dug up and transferred to other sites for disposal, the volume of soil requiring remediation will be considerably smaller than the high volumes estimated by IEMS. With respect to what might require remediation, the Tribunal's views are as follows.\n\n576.\n\nIn the event that the expert considers that certain mud pits do not meet the requisite standards, they shall be remediated. Consistent with the Tribunal's findings, this would involve *in-situ* disposal in properly constructed and sealed pits. In such circumstances, it is unlikely that there would be much in the way of transportation costs associated with the relocation and confinement of such soils.\n\n577.\n\nIn the case of other soils that are found to be contaminated, the determination of whether such soils can be properly treated and disposed of in the Blocks is not something that the Tribunal can decide in the abstract. If the expert finds that a particular volume of soil requires special treatment due to the nature of the contamination and that that treatment is better provided off-site, it follows that the soil must be treated in the most environmentally protective manner possible and transportation as well as remediation costs will be incurred.\n\n578.\n\nIf there is any soil that cannot be treated and instead needs to be confined in a hazardous waste landfill, then the Tribunal considers that it must be confined in a properly constructed and licenced hazardous waste landfill. If there is such a facility located within an industrial area situated in the Blocks, such soil could be deposited there. If there is any doubt as to whether such a landfill is suitable, any contaminated soil that must be landfilled should not be kept in the Amazonian rainforest area of Ecuador, but rather disposed of in a less environmentally sensitive area of the country. For this reason, the Tribunal is not attracted to GSI's suggestion of the construction of an on-site landfill in either of the Blocks.1154\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 246, Appendix H.\n\n579.\n\nAs for the costs associated with the treatment and, if necessary, transport of contaminated soil, the Tribunal considers that the expert must be guided by in-country price quotations that realistically reflect the conditions in which the work will be performed.1155 The Tribunal's sense is that the estimates employed by IEMS were too far removed from Ecuador and not tied to actual in-country remediations (such as those conducted at the behest of Petroamazonas and Petroecuador) to be considered to be reliable.1156 The Tribunal also has doubts that there is not sufficient in-country expertise to deal with such remediation as might be required.1157 If the Tribunal's expert is persuaded otherwise and the matter returns to the Tribunal for final determination, the Tribunal will revisit its present assumption in that regard.\n\nIEMS used, for example, unit costs for remediation of abandoned hazardous waste landfills in the United States as published by the Federal Roundtable on Remediation Technologies and the US EPA's \"Cleaning Hazardous Waste\", the European Contaminated Land Rehabilitiation Network for Environmental Technologies. 2nd IEMS ER, pp 170, 171, 173; IEMS ER III, Attachment 34.2. It also referred to pricing information received from two Ecuadorian contractors, but this was limited. See the \"economical quotation\" for another site given by GPower and submitted with the Reply. IEMS ER III, Attachment 34.3. In contrast, GSI looked at prior remediation projects in the Oriente area, costs published by the Pit Remediation Project of the Ecuadorian Oriente Region, and quotes from private contractors (GSI ER I, Appendix G.2.).\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Perenco that actual costs are the best guide for estimating comparagraphble remediation works (Rejoinder, paragraph 14). Perenco argued that IEMS' costs estimates were some 400% higher than actual, verified costs in Ecuador for the relevant remediation work (Rejoinder, paragraph 25).\n\nAs Perenco observed, a number of local contractors are licences by the Ministry of Environment and perform work for oil companies, including State-owned companies (Rejoinder, paragraph 212).\n\n580.\n\nTherefore, when estimating costs of any remediation for which Perenco is liable, the expert shall be guided by Ecuadorian costs. These are expected to be much closer to the \u2018per unit' costs estimated by GSI (the Tribunal noting however the qualification that the work required may be more substantial than that estimated by GSI) than to those employed by IEMS.\n\n**F. Validation of the Experts' Conflicting Contamination Determinations and Delineations Thereof**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nThe Tribunal has now arrived at the point where it has narrowed the counterclaim on the principal issues of law and fact. The Tribunal has set out the main issues of fact and law which have divided the experts. However, with regard to many of the IEMS/GSI differences, the Tribunal does not feel able to prefer one above the other. It seems to the Tribunal that each was attempting to achieve the best result for the party by whom they were instructed, and that they crossed the boundary between professional objective analysis and party representation. It is clear to the Tribunal that the experts were effectively shooting at different targets and this has made the work of this Tribunal most difficult.\n\n582.\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence, the Tribunal is satisfied that there is some contamination in the Blocks for which it is likely that Perenco will be held liable. Even GSI was prepared to accept that there was contamination in the two Blocks (although Perenco argued that such contamination resulted from the acts of other parties).\n\n583.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence and has found that there are certain issues of fact on which it is extremely difficult for it to make proper determinations. As has been seen, the Tribunal has completely rejected the IEMS' mapping exercise based on background values and has found that the appropriate means for establishing the volume of contaminated soils is delineation. In addition, the Tribunal has rejected certain interpretations of the Ecuadorian regulatory standards applied by IEMS. In applying the proper regulatory standards, the Tribunal finds that the expert evidence from both sides does not provide a sufficient degree of confidence as to the actual conditions in the Blocks. The Tribunal considers that there are too many gaps and conflicts between IEMS' and GSI's evidence on these key issues. For example, GSI did not take samples at all of the sites that IEMS tested; for certain sites where IEMS found contamination, GSI also tested the soil but took samples at different depths, and GSI used \"indicator parameters\" rather than testing comprehensively for all possible oilfield related contaminants. The Tribunal considers that these gaps must be filled and the technical conflicts must be resolved in order to arrive at a fair and proper disposition of Ecuador's counterclaim.\n\n584.\n\nIn its post-hearing submission, Perenco essentially posited that the Tribunal faces an \u2018all or nothing' decision:\n\nThe various technical issues on which GSI and IEMS so fundamentally disagree are relevant not because the Tribunal should take as its task picking and choosing between the experts on each issue one by one, cafeteria-style, to arrive at some hybrid approach. There is too much interrelationship between the issues to make that kind of exercise productive. Instead, those technical issues are relevant because they provide the basis on which the Tribunal can assess the two approaches, and the basis on which the Tribunal should conclude that GSI's approach is far more reliable and trustworthy than IEMS' approach.1158\n\nPerenco's Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 50.\n\n585.\n\nWhile the Tribunal agrees with Perenco that given the present state of the evidence it should not \"take as its task picking and choosing between the experts on each issue one by one, cafeteria-style\" - because the Tribunal does not possess the requisite technical expertise to decide between experts' disagreements over highly technical issues - it is equally uncomfortable with simply picking one set of experts' conclusions over the other. The Tribunal well understands that the onus of proof is on a party who makes an allegation and it could be said that because of the doubt in which the Tribunal finds itself Ecuador could be said to have failed in tipping the burden in its favour. However, as the Tribunal is satisfied that there has been some damage for which it seems likely that Perenco is liable, the Tribunal is not disposed to dismiss the counterclaim *in limine.* Given the Constitution's embrace of the importance of the protection of the environment, the most accurate picture of the environmental condition of the Blocks possible - based on the prior sampling locations of both IEMS and GSI - must inform the Tribunal's decision on the counterclaim.\n\n586.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal has concluded that it must require an additional phase of factfinding in order to arrive at a proper and just conclusion. It is not content to issue a final determination on the extent of Perenco's liability on the basis of the current expert reports.\n\n587.\n\nAs already intimated, the Tribunal intends to appoint its own independent environmental expert who will be instructed to apply the Tribunal's findings set out above and work with the Tribunal and the Parties to enable the Tribunal to determine the extent of contamination in the Blocks for which compensation is owed.\n\n588.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to underscore the fact that the expert chosen to conduct this investigation (after consultation with the Parties to ensure complete independence and impartiality) will be the Tribunal's expert and will be solely answerable to the Tribunal. In due course, the Tribunal will provide a protocol for the expert, setting out the precise questions to be answered in line with the findings made in this Decision. The Parties will be permitted to attend when the expert and his/her team carries out the necessary investigations and the Parties will receive a copy of the expert's report and will be permitted to comment thereon in due course. Naturally, the costs involved in this exercise will initially be borne by the Parties in equal shares with any subsequent allocation of costs to be determined by the Tribunal at the appropriate time.\n\n589.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to emphasise that with the effluxion of time it will be necessary to consider what impact Petroamazonas has had on the environmental conditions in Blocks 7 and 21. It intends to deal with this issue as follows.\n\n590.\n\nFirst, in the Tribunal's view, IEMS and GSI had ample opportunity to take samples in whatever parts of the Blocks either considered necessary. The Tribunal's expert will therefore confine his/her work to the specific sites at which soil samples were taken and groundwater sampling wells were drilled. Although, due to the differences between IEMS and GSI's sampling practices, it will be necessary for the expert to re-sample at those sites where contamination was detected by one or the other party's experts and to delineate the extent of any such contamination, the Tribunal's expert will not sample other sites that the Parties' experts did not sample.\n\n591.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal recognises that the conditions likely to exist in 2015 might have been affected by the actions of Petroamazonas. It might therefore be necessary for the Tribunal to determine Perenco's share of any responsibility for contamination in order to ensure that it is not made responsible for the acts of Petroamazonas.\n\n592.\n\nThird, the Tribunal wishes to make clear that this course of action is not intended to provide any opportunity for the Parties to provide new evidence (except that called for by the Tribunal in aid of its expert). They have had ample opportunity to present their cases. The purpose of the next phase is for the Tribunal's expert to validate one approach or the other in respect of the remaining technical issues.\n\n593.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal considers it highly desirable for the Parties to take time to properly digest the contents of this Decision and its implications in the overall scheme of things, and they may wish to consider embarking on a mediation process or some other consensual procedure to assist in arriving at a mutually acceptable figure. Having regard to the Tribunal's findings in relation to: (i) background values; (ii) the temporal application of the 2008 Constitution to the facts of this case; (iii) the applicable standards under Ecuadorian law; (iv) the 2008 Constitution's variation of the limitations period; (v) the Tribunal's criticism of the narrowness of GSI's sampling practices; (vi) the Tribunal's rejection of IEMS' mapping and unit costs for remediation; and (vii) the fact the Tribunal will not permit the sampling of areas in the Blocks which were not previously sampled by either party's experts, the Tribunal believes that the remaining issues are most unlikely to lead to an award of damages anywhere near the amount claimed by Ecuador. The Parties will doubtless take all this into account as well as the considerable cost of the further enquiry which the Tribunal considers is absolutely necessary to arrive at a just result in the circumstances of this case in deciding whether it is possible for them to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of this aspect of the dispute.\n\n594.\n\nThe Tribunal's strong preference and hope is that after receiving this Decision and considering the Tribunal's findings, the legal aspects of the counterclaim will have been sufficiently clarified so as to enable the Parties to agree on a suitable amount of compensation with or without the assistance of an independent expert or a final Tribunal determination. In the event that such an agreement is reached, it will be recorded and included in the Tribunal's Award. If an agreement is not reached, the Tribunal will await the results of its expert's work and make a final decision which will be included in the Award.\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that it is almost certain that the sampling performed by both experts did not adequately capture all of the contamination. Indeed, notwithstanding its initial declaration that its intention was to \"achieve a comprehensive assessment of current environmental conditions for each of the 74 oilfield facilities investigated by IEMS in the CPUF, Block 7, and Block 21 area\", this is not what GSI did.1159 As Ecuador pointed out, GSI accepted that it confined its investigation to seeking to invalidate RECs identified by IEMS...1160 Mr. Connor further confirmed that GSI did not attempt to comprehensively estimate the amount of contamination in the Blocks, separately from its review of IEMS' work, and acknowledged that both experts could have missed instances of contamination.1161 Be this as it may, the present exercise is concerned with an accurate and impartial analysis of the work that was done by the experts - who had ample opportunity to examine the Blocks. Their work must now be evaluated by the expert in accordance with the Tribunal's findings.\n\nGSI ER I, paragraph 2.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 140 (Opening Statement of Philip Dunham).\n\nSee, for e.g., Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, p 1709- 1716, 1723-1725, 1729, 1733 (Testimony of GSI).\n\n596.\n\nIt need hardly be said that every attempt must be made to base the determination of damages owed on the situation existing at the time of the Consortium's departure in July 2009.\n\n597.\n\nTurning to certain sampling issues, the Tribunal notes that GSI excluded platforms and CPFs from its investigation, because it took the position that they are \"operating industrial facilities\", a position which Ecuador rejects as an unjustified basis on which to exclude what it says in effect amounts to some 26% of the contamination beyond regulatory levels identified by IEMS in Block 7, this figure rising to 50% in Block 21.1162 Given the fact that platforms and CPFs have been taken over and employed by Petroamazonas, it is difficult to apportion responsibility for any contamination therein. The Tribunal is also mindful of Mr. Connor's cautionary words about Ecuador's proposed approach to remediation of operating platforms:\n\nBasically at facilities where operations are ongoing, it doesn't force you to remediate. It says, \"You must manage that impact.\" And the management could include a remediation component, but certainly it doesn't obligate it, and the practice is it doesn't happen. And the reason it doesn't happen is because you don't want to go with very large machines, start digging a platform that has high-pressure pipes, that has a well head under pressure, where you're conducting risky operations. It doesn't make sense.1163\n\nSee Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 141-142 (Opening Statement of Philip Dunham). GSI accepts that it excluded from its investigation platforms and CPFs, otherwise referred to as \"operating industrial facilities\", because it took the position that remediation was not required within the limits of platforms (GSI ER I, Appendix D: \"exceedances in soil were within an operating industrial facility\"). RPS challenged this position (RPS ER II, p 12). Ecuador submits that this is an unjustified and significant omission because IEMS identified 20 platforms which exhibited contamination beyond regulatory levels.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, p 1742 (Testimony of GSI).\n\n598.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the only equitable solution in relation to exceedances that were detected on operating platforms is to have the expert examine the exceedances samples taken by IEMS, consider their significance in light of all relevant circumstances, and if they are deemed to warrant remediation, Perenco is *prima facie* liable for the costs thereof (having regard to the Tribunal's findings on the operation of Ecuadorian law made above), and subject to the expert's examining Petroamazonas' post-16 July 2009 spill reporting records to ensure that Perenco is not being held liable for the acts of its successor. In the event of any overlapping contamination, it will be necessary to apportion responsibility between the two.\n\n599.\n\nIf there are any platforms in the Blocks that were operated by Perenco and are no longer operated, Mr. Connor's concern is no longer relevant. Consistent with the 2008 Constitution's emphasis on full restoration, such platforms must be remediated to the full extent of industry best practice under Ecuadorian law. The same applies to any wells that were retired by Perenco. The objective should be to remediate to the fullest extent possible, consistent with the Constitution's objective of full restoration (and the Participation Contracts' objective of returning those areas to their natural state).1164\n\nAs, for example, stated in the Block 21 Contract at clause 5.1.20.10, which requires the contractor to: \"Take responsibility for the cleanup and reforestation of the area with species similar to those originally found at the site, in order to, with time, allow the potential return to environmental conditions similar to those encountered at the beginning of the operations; also take responsibility for the abandonment of wells and installations for which the Contractor has been responsible as a consequence of the execution of this Contract. Said cleanup, reforestation and return to similar conditions and abandonment activities shall be performed in accordance with the Environmental Regulation for Hydrocarbon Operations and the Environmental Impact Study. The Contractor shall not be liable for environmental conditions preexisting at the beginning of operations under the Services Contract. In cases in which the competent authorities order the remediation of the environment in the Contract Area, due to preexisting conditions, the costs and contracting [for this purpose] shall not be the responsibility of the Contractor.\" (Exhibit CE-17/CE-CC-28, Block 7 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04764, 04768, 04769.)\n\n600.\n\nIn addition to platforms and retired wells, the Tribunal's expert must examine all sites in which regulatory exceedances have been identified by either or both of the Parties' experts. If, because the Parties' experts sampled at different levels, it is necessary to take new samples, that shall be done, and such sampling shall, under the direction of the Tribunal's expert, be comprehensive and designed to determine whether exceedances do or do not exist at each previously identified site. Any resampling must occur only at the specific sites already identified in the IEMS and GSI reports.\n\n601.\n\nTo the extent that the areas surrounding those points of contamination were not delineated, for example, because IEMS did not delineate them due to its reliance upon the ArcGIS software or because GSI did not delineate certain sites because they did not pass its \"indicator parameter\" screen or for other reasons, that process of delineation must now occur, and it must be conducted properly, under the direction of the Tribunal's expert.\n\n602.\n\nIf there is any evidence that any area which remains to be delineated has since been contaminated by Petroamazonas, that evidence must be taken into account and the amount of damages payable must be reduced appropriately. In the event of any dispute about a particular site, Ecuador shall be required to provide all relevant documentation pertaining to the environmental condition of that site since July 19, 2009.\n\n603.\n\nThe sampling review and any additional delineation must check every instance of contamination identified by IEMS and GSI and determine whether it is established in light of the Tribunal's foregoing determinations of the applicable regulatory rule. Where there are sites that were sampled by IEMS but not by GSI and/or the samples were tested for substances by IEMS but not tested by GSI, the focus will necessarily have to be based on IEMS' samples unless the independent expert concludes that there is a need to take new samples.\n\n604.\n\nThe same exercise must be performed in relation to the mud pits used by Perenco up to 16 July 2009. Perenco cannot be held liable for pits constructed by prior operators which it itself did not use, because by definition it would be able to show that any damage caused from leachates escaping from such pits cannot be attributed to it. It can only be held liable for damage resulting from the pits which it used or built. It is necessary to ascertain whether the drilling muds were disposed of in a properly constructed sealed pit or disposed of in an unsealed pit or one that was improperly constructed and which therefore may be more susceptible to leaching.\n\n605.\n\nUnless visual or other testing clearly demonstrates that a pit was lined, then the more conservative and environmentally protective remediation criteria set out in RAOHE Table 7(a) shall be applied to ensure that any leaching which might have taken place is contained and remediated and that there is no further prospect of contamination. In this respect, mindful of IEMS' allegation that GSI took samples too far away from the pits, which the Tribunal is not in a position to determine, the Tribunal's expert shall ensure that any new samples are taken at the appropriate spots situated around the perimeters of the pits.\n\n606.\n\nAs for pits that Perenco constructed and that have been since used by Petroamazonas, again it will be necessary to apportion responsibility between the two companies in the event of any exceedances.\n\n607.\n\nThe groundwater issue presents particular difficulties because the Tribunal is uncomfortable with both side's sampling: IEMS' because it appeared to be compromised by the wells and the materials used to take samples, and GSI's because of its filtering of all samples which had the effect of reducing the possibility of detecting certain contaminants that should be looked for without filtering.\n\n608.\n\nThis issue is complicated by the effluxion of time. The Tribunal considers that the only equitable solution is for a new, proper groundwater campaign to be conducted under its expert's supervision and then an allocation of any remediation costs (if remediation is required) to be made as between Perenco and Petroamazonas. Such sampling shall be taken at the same sites at which the experts took samples. Since Perenco ran the Blocks from late 2002 until mid-July 2009 (roughly six and a half years) and Petroamazonas has operated them from mid-July 2009 to the present day (roughly five and a half years) the allocation will be based on the amount of time in which the Blocks have been under the stewardship of the two operators (e.g. 55/45%).\n\n609.\n\nOnce this exercise has been completed, it will be possible to arrive either at a negotiated settlement of the damages owed by Perenco to Ecuador, or the Tribunal will be in a position to make a final determination.\n\n610.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has evaluated the infrastructure counterclaim. It has decided that it is most expedient and constructive for this Decision on the principal counterclaim to be issued so as to permit the expert to be selected, appointed, instructed on his/her mandate and to then engage in the work that needs to be done. The infrastructure counterclaim, although important, is for a significantly lesser sum. In addition, the Tribunal considers that it might profit from the evidence pertaining to Perenco's operatorship that will be adduced in the quantum phase and feels that it would be best to leave this claim to be addressed in the overall quantum.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n611.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) Ecuadorian law, in the form of Ecuador's Constitution, and specific regulatory provisions within RAOHE, TULAS and the Environmental Management Law, provides the standards governing the Tribunal's evaluation of the environmental condition of Blocks 7 and 21. It does not require the Tribunal to generally apply a \"background values\" or \"base values\" approach.\n\n(2) RAOHE and TULAS provide the regulatory limits applicable to the evaluation of the environmental condition of lands on which hydrocarbon operations have been permitted to take place in furtherance of the Environmental Management Law's general framework.\n\n(3) For the period commencing 4 September 2002, when Perenco first acquired its interests in the Blocks, through to 19 October 2008, the 1998 Constitution's fault-based regime applies.\n\n(4) For any contamination in excess of regulatory standards shown to have occurred after 20 October 2008 up until the Consortium suspended operations on 16 July 2009, Perenco is strictly liable in accordance with the 2008 Constitution's strict-liability regime for environmental damage.\n\n(5) With regard to any environmental harm occurring in the Blocks from 16 July 2009, when Petromazonas took over the Blocks, Perenco bears no liability. Its remediation obligation extends only to regulatory exceedances that predate Petroamazonas's activities and which themselves have not been overtaken by Petroamazonas's new works.\n\n(6) The four-year limitation period of Article 2235 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code does not bar Ecuador's counterclaim.\n\n(7) Perenco's submission that it bears no responsibility for the Blocks on the basis that Petroamazonas is now the operator and its ownership interests in the Blocks have been brought to an end is rejected.\n\n(8) The Tribunal shall appoint an independent environmental expert to assist the Tribunal in ascertaining the environmental condition of the Blocks in accordance with the legal and factual findings made by the Tribunal in this Decision. The Tribunal will consult the Parties with regard to the appointment of the Tribunal's expert and will take their views into account but the decision as to the identity of and scope of work of the expert will be that of the Tribunal alone.\n\n(9) The Tribunal anticipates that the process of appointing an expert will take some two months; during this period, the Parties are instructed to review the findings made in this Decision and to consult with each other with a view to discussing whether it would be possible to arrive at a settlement of this counterclaim in a manner consistent with this Decision. Any communications or documents exchanged by the Parties in connection with such discussions shall be on a without prejudice basis and shall not be disclosed to the Tribunal or to the Tribunal's expert in the event that no settlement is reached.\n\n(10) The expert will be instructed to apply the Tribunal's findings and work with the Tribunal and the Parties to enable the Tribunal to determine the extent of contamination in the Blocks for which remediation is required. At all times the expert will be solely answerable to the Tribunal.\n\n(11) The expert will be required to perform its work in accordance with the directions set out in this Decision and as set out in any protocol that might be issued by the Tribunal after consultation with the Parties.\n\n(12) Delineation, instead of modelling, shall be employed to determine the volume of any soil that requires remediation.\n\n(13) Table 6, Annex 2 of RAOHE applies to the identification and remediation of contaminated soil, but to the extent that it is silent, TULAS Book VI, Annex 2, Table 3, applies.\n\n(14) Ecuadorian law relevant to evaluation of the environmental effect of hydrocarbon operations on land does not require the use of indicator parameters.\n\n(15) In any case of doubt as to the applicable land-use criteria, subject to prior determinations of Ecuadorian authorities which have significant probative value, the more stringent land-use designation applies.\n\n(16) On the matter of mud-pits, Table 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE provides the applicable technical standard, and Perenco has no obligation to dig up and remediate properly constructed and confined mud pits whose contents do not exceed the applicable regulatory standard. If a pit has an impermeable liner, Table 7(b) applies. If there is no impermeable liner, Table 7(a) applies. In any case of doubt, the more environmentally protective standard in Table 7(a) applies.\n\n(17) On the matter of groundwater testing, the expert shall undertake groundwater sampling in accordance with the Tribunal's determination of the appropriate technical standard under Ecuadorian law and industry practice as set out in this Decision. Its sampling shall be confined to to the sampling locations identified by IEMS and GSI. Given the effluxion of time, it might be necessary to allocate responsibility for remediation as between Perenco and Petroamazonas.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn April 18, 2017, the Claimant filed an Application for Dismissal of Ecuador's Counterclaims (the \"Application\"), requesting the Tribunal to issue an Order:\n\na) declaring that Ecuador's counterclaims are inadmissible on the grounds of *res judicata* ;\n\nb) dismissing Ecuador's counterclaims with prejudice; and\n\nc) ordering Ecuador to pay all the costs of the arbitration, as well as Perenco's fees and expenses, for the counterclaims phase of these proceedings.1\n\nApplication, para. 41.\n\n2.\n\nOn April 20, 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to agree, by April 27, 2017, on the briefing schedule for Claimant's Application.\n\n3.\n\nThe Parties having failed to reach an agreement on such schedule, the Tribunal informed the Parties through a letter from its Secretary of May 3, 2017, that it determined the following calendar for the filing of the respective written pleadings:\n\na) May 23, 2017 for Ecuador's Response to Perenco's Application for Dismissal of Counterclaims (the \"Response\");\n\nb) June 13, 2017 for Perenco's Reply in Support of its Application to Dismiss Ecuador's Counterclaims (the \"Reply\"); and\n\nc) July 4, 2017 for Ecuador's Rejoinder on Perenco's Request for Dismissal of Counterclaims (the \"Rejoinder\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Parties filed their written submissions within the above time limits.\n\n**II. Arguments of the Parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n*1. Arguments of Perenco*\n-------------------------\n\n5.\n\nIn its Application, Perenco submits that \"[w]ith the issuance of the Award in the *Burlington* Arbitration on 7 February 2017, the *Burlington* Tribunal has definitively resolved Ecuador's counterclaims against the Consortium for alleged environmental harm and failure to maintain the Blocks' infrastructure.\"2 Perenco contends that \"Ecuador's counterclaims are identical as against each of the Consortium partners, the liability at issue in those counterclaims is joint and several as between Perenco and Burlington, and the *Burlington* Award has definitively resolved that joint and several liability.\"3 In Perenco's view,\"[t]he *Burlington* Award therefore has *res judicata* effect in this proceeding, and [this] Tribunal... should dispense with any further consideration of and dismiss Ecuador's counterclaims.\"4\n\nApplication, para. 1.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n6.\n\nPerenco submits that this Tribunal has authority to apply *res judicata* to preclude relitigation of a dispute that has already been decided. It argues that the application of the principle of \"*res judicata* is fully warranted [in this case] because Ecuador has brought the same dispute against the Consortium members [Perenco and Burlington] in two separate proceedings\"5 and \"Ecuador's counterclaims in both proceedings concern the same subject matter and are premised on the same legal basis.\"6 It points out that \"the *Burlington* tribunal itself has recognized [that] 'the two arbitrations essentially deal with the same alleged damages' and Ecuador did not dispute the fact that it sought [what *Burlington* calls] 'identical overlapping compensation with regard to the same alleged damage' in both proceedings.\"7\n\n*Ibid*., para. 8.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 15, quoting from *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Counterclaims, February 7, 2017, paras. 65 and 70 (CA-CC-59) [hereinafter *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims].\n\n7.\n\nIn the elaboration of its submission, Perenco refers to the argument put forward by Ecuador in its Reply on the Counterclaims that \"pursuant to Ecuadorian law, all the authors of a tort (such as environmental harm) are jointly liable to its victim. Accordingly, Ecuador is entitled to claim for the total amount of damages from Perenco or Burlington or any other author of the environmental harm caused. How the different authors of the environmental harm should ultimately share liability and pay money back to each other is a matter of no concern to Ecuador.\"8\n\n*Ibid*., para. 16, quoting from Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, para. 8.\n\n8.\n\nPerenco emphasizes that:\n\n(a) \"Ecuador's counterclaims in both the *Burlington* and *Perenco* arbitrations allege the same environmental and infrastructure damage allegedly caused by the Consortium during its operation of Blocks 7 and 21\";9\n\n(b) \"Ecuador raised identical arguments to demonstrate that the Consortium violated the same provisions of Ecuadorian law\";10\n\n(c) \"[T]he factual issues raised in both counterclaims proceedings were the same and Ecuador presented materially identical evidence in both proceedings\";11and\n\n(d) \"Ecuador has even demanded identical relief from both tribunals.\"12\n\n*Ibid*., para. 17.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 18.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 19.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 20.\n\n9.\n\nOn the basis of the above arguments, and the characterization of the two proceedings, Perenco concludes that \"all the issues - whether factual or legal - forming the basis of Ecuador's counterclaims in the *Perenco* proceedings have been determined, after extensive briefing and submissions, in the *Burlington*... Decision [on the counterclaims]\".13 Therefore, in its view, \"[n]ow that the... Decision [on the counterclaims] has been incorporated into the *Burlington* Award, it fully and finally disposes of Ecuador's counterclaims on the Consortium's liability.\"14\n\n*Ibid*., para. 21.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n10.\n\nExpecting that Ecuador will oppose the Application on the basis that Perenco and Burlington have different legal personalities, Perenco urges the Tribunal to \"reject any such formalistic arguments... because Burlington and Perenco amply satisfy the identity of parties requirement.\"15\n\n*Ibid*., para. 22.\n\n11.\n\nIn support of this view, Perenco argues that:\n\n(a) Perenco and Burlington operated Blocks 7 and 21 together as the members of the Consortium;16\n\n(b) the liability that Ecuador puts at issue is the Consortium's;17\n\n(c) in case that this \"Tribunal does not agree that Perenco and Burlington are the same party - *i.e.* Consortium - for the purposes of Ecuador's counterclaims, they are at the very least privies in interest.\"18 In this context, it refers to the second decision of the tribunal in *Ampal-American Israel Corp. et al v. Arab Republic of Egypt* which took the view that \"the doctrine of *res judicata* applies not simply to the parties themselves but also to those who are in privity of interest with them.\"19\n\n*Ibid*., para. 23.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 24. Perenco draws the Tribunal's attention, by way of example, to different parts of Ecuador's written pleadings in which the latter referred to the Consortium's environmental liability. In Annex A to its Reply, Perenco provides the full list of references to the \"Consortium\" being liable in Ecuador's written submissions, both in the present proceedings as well as in the *Burlington* proceedings.\n\nApplication, para. 25. See also Reply, paras. 24 *et seq*.\n\nApplication, para. 25. The quote is from *Ampal-American Israel Corporation and others v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss, February 21, 2017, para. 261 (CA-CC-72).\n\n12.\n\nIn its Reply, Perenco maintains its submissions and elaborates them further in answering Ecuador's arguments in the latter's Response. It stresses that it is Ecuador \"who formulated *verbatim* identical counterclaims for the exact same harm on the exact same legal basis in two separate proceedings\",20 claiming \"the full amount of alleged damages against each of Burlington and Perenco.\"21 It also points out that it was Ecuador \"who rebuffed Perenco's attempt to have those identical counterclaims determined only in the *Burlington* proceedings.\"22\n\nReply, para. 1; see also paras. 7 and 8.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*., see also para. 21. Perenco submits as Exhibit CE-CC-415 a copy of its letter of June 24, 2011 addressed to Ecuador in which Perenco proposed \"that the counterclaims be fully addressed in the Burlington Arbitration as to all parties, including Perenco\". It is to be noted that, at that moment, Ecuador raised counterclaims only against Burlington, but not yet against Perenco. The counterclaims against Perenco were presented by Ecuador on December 5, 2011 as part of its Counter-Memorial on Liability. The Tribunal had been earlier, on July 13, 2011, informed by Ecuador that \"it may submit various counterclaims with its counter-memorial [on liability]\". See Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, August 11, 2015, paras. 5 and 6. Ecuador, through its letter to Perenco of June 29, 2011 declined Perenco's proposal that the counterclaims be dealt with only by the *Burlington* Tribunal on the grounds that \"[t]he current situation results from Burlington's and Perenco's decision to bring separate claims against Ecuador\" and that \"[i]t must have been self-evident to Burlington and Perenco that one consequence of their decision would be that any counterclaims by Ecuador could be brought in the separate proceedings.\" (CE-CC-416).\n\n13.\n\nPerenco also rejects Ecuador's argument that its Application is premature in view of the fact that the *Burlington* award is subject to annulment proceedings initiated by Ecuador.23 Nor does Perenco agree with Ecuador's contention that its Application is precluded by ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) and that it waived its right to now invoke *res judicata* as a ground for declaring Ecuador's counterclaims in these proceedings inadmissible.24\n\nReply, paras. 45 *et seq*.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 49 *et seq*.\n\n14.\n\nAt the end of its Reply, Perenco revised its request for relief. It requests this Tribunal to issue an Order:\n\n\"a. Declaring that Ecuador's counterclaims are inadmissible on the ground of *res judicata* and dismissing Ecuador's counterclaims with prejudice;\n\nb. In the alternative:\n\ni. Ordering as part of the award in this case that Perenco is jointly and severally liable with Burlington for US $ 41,776,492.77 (the 'Gross Counterclaims Amount') in respect of Ecuador's counterclaims against the Perenco-Burlington Consortium;\n\nii. Declaring that Perenco has no further liability with respect to the counterclaims beyond the Gross Counterclaims Amount, or such portion of this amount that remains net of any satisfaction that Ecuador has obtained from Burlington (the 'Net Counterclaims Amount');\n\niii. Further ordering that Perenco may satisfy the Net Counterclaims Amount by deducting it from the amount that Ecuador owes to Perenco under this Tribunal's final award; and\n\niv. Otherwise conditioning the above order on obtaining satisfactory guarantees from Ecuador that it will not enforce the Tribunal's Award and the *Burlington* Award cumulatively, whether by offset or otherwise, such that the Gross Counterclaims Amount is the full amount that Ecuador can recover against both Perenco and Burlington; and\n\nc. Ordering that Ecuador hold Perenco harmless against any future claims based on alleged environmental and infrastructure liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21, before any jurisdiction whatsoever whether arbitral or judicial, national or international; and\n\nd. Ordering Ecuador to pay all the costs of the arbitration, as well as Perenco's fees and expenses, for the counterclaims phase of these proceedings.\"25\n\n*Ibid*., para. 65.\n\n*2. Arguments of Ecuador*\n-------------------------\n\n15.\n\nEcuador requests the Tribunal to dismiss Perenco's Application for several reasons.\n\n16.\n\nIt considers it late since the Parties have been arbitrating \"the still-pending counterclaims\" for more than five years. Ecuador characterizes Perenco's approach as an \"opportunistic and eleventh-hour desperate attempt to avoid this Tribunal's decision which is expected in the coming months.\"26 It argues that if Perenco wished to prevent parallel litigation of the counterclaims, it \"should have filed a *lis pendens* application many years ago\",27 as early as in December 2011. In Ecuador's view, Perenco \"waited until it knew what the result of the *Burlington* arbitration was\"28 and now hopes to \"take advantage of the known result in the *Burlington* arbitration, to limit its liability towards Ecuador.\"29 Ecuador contends that \"Perenco's environmental experts have no doubt anticipated [that] this Tribunal's independent environmental expert is likely to find significantly more environmental damage than the *Burlington* tribunal in its recent Award.\"30 Ecuador alleges that \"Perenco has most likely realized that, as the operator of Blocks 7 and 21, it could be solely responsible for the infrastructure and environmental harm caused to these Blocks.\"31 Ecuador is convinced that \"this Tribunal, with the assistance of its own independent expert, will find far more pollution in Blocks 7 and 21 than the *Burlington* tribunal did\"32 and thus alleges that \"Perenco simply concluded that its situation could only worsen.\"33\n\n*Response*, para. 1.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 4 and 10. See also Rejoinder *,* paras. 24-26.\n\nResponse, para. 11.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nRejoinder, para. 8.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 9.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n17.\n\nEcuador submits that Perenco's Application is inadmissible on the basis of ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1), 26(3) and 27 because Perenco did not raise its objection promptly,34 and \"accordingly waived its right to object.\"35\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 27 and 31.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 31.\n\n18.\n\nEcuador also points out that this Tribunal was the first one to issue its Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim in August 2015 while the *Burlington* tribunal rendered its Decision on Counterclaims only in February 2017. In Ecuador's view, the Interim Decision resolved \"at least twelve different legal and factual issues with finality.\"36 Perenco's Application is thus precluded by this Tribunal's Interim Decision and it should be declared inadmissible.37\n\nResponse, para. 31.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 3-4 and 11 *et seq*.\n\n19.\n\nIt also denies that the *Burlington* tribunal has definitively resolved the counterclaims. It draws this Tribunal's attention to the fact that the *Burlington* Award is the subject of annulment proceedings.38 In Ecuador's view, \"an ICSID award that is the object of a pending application for annulment... cannot be invoked as having *res judicata* effect.\"39\n\nResponse, paras. 4 and 37; Rejoinder, paras. 6 and 40.\n\nRejoinder, para. 40.\n\n20.\n\nEcuador, in its Annulment Application, challenges the *Burlington* Award also as far as the Decision on Counterclaims, which has been made an integral part of the Award,40 is concerned. It argues that the *Burlington* tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state its reasons when dealing with the counterclaims, pointing to some twelve \"serious flaws\".41\n\nSee *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Reconsideration and Award, February 7, 2017, para. 9 (CL-CC-60) [hereinafter *Burlington* Award].\n\nResponse, para. 38. In a letter to the Tribunal (copied to Perenco) of June 12, 2017, Ecuador informed the Tribunal that on June 7, 2017, it filed a supplemental annulment application setting out, \"in addition to the five grounds for annulment\" stated in its Application of February 14, 2017, seven further grounds.\n\n21.\n\nEcuador submits that if the annulment application is successful and if this Tribunal were now to dismiss, with prejudice, its counterclaims as inadmissible, as requested by Perenco, Ecuador would be deprived of a decision on its counterclaims,42 leaving it \"without any decision whatsoever on the environmental harm caused to Blocks 7 and 21, despite having been engaged in six years of costly proceedings, during which the existence of such harm was confirmed by both tribunals.\"43\n\nResponse, para. 4.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 43 (emphasis in the original).\n\n22.\n\nEcuador submits that in any event Perenco's position on *res judicata* \"is manifestly contrary to international law\",44 and therefore the Application has to be dismissed. It elaborates that in international law *res judicata* applies between two disputes only when the triple identity test is satisfied: there shall be the same parties, the same subject matter and the same cause of action.45\n\n*Ibid*., para. 47.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 48 and 49.\n\n23.\n\nEcuador argues that Perenco and Burlington are legally and economically independent entities, that they are not the same party, either formally or in effect.46 It points out that the counterclaims it brought up in the *Burlington* arbitration were against Burlington, and not against Perenco or the Consortium. It further emphasises that the jurisdiction of the *Burlington* tribunal to hear and determine the counterclaims derived from an agreement entered into by Burlington and Ecuador on May 26, 2011, to which Perenco was not a party.47 And it adds that \"the *Burlington* tribunal did not overstep the limits of its jurisdiction\",48 and pronounced itself only on the liability of Burlington in respect of the counterclaims, not on Perenco's, nor on the Consortium's liability, which would not even be possible since the Consortium has no legal personality under Ecuadorian law.49\n\n*Ibid*., para. 53; Rejoinder, para. 78.\n\nResponse, paras. 55, 57-59. Ecuador refers to para. 60 of the *Burlington* Award, although the reference should rather be to para. 60 of the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims of the same date, which was subsequently made an integral part of the Award.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 60.\n\nRejoinder, para. 55.\n\n24.\n\nEcuador thus contends that \"Burlington and Perenco are not functionally the same party for counterclaims purposes\" but \"[t]hey have independent liability, separately put at issue in distinct proceedings\".50\n\nResponse, para. 64.\n\n25.\n\nEcuador also rejects Perenco's argument that *res judicata* applies, despite the lack of formal identity between Perenco and Burlington, because the two companies were privies-in-interest. It maintains that \"[ *r* ] *es judicata* applies only when there is strict identity of the parties to the first and second arbitrations.\"51 According to Ecuador, privity, in its natural definition, \"exists specifically between an owner and property.\"52 It explains that \"[w]hen the property is party to an arbitration, the owner equally stands to benefit or suffer economically as a direct consequence of its outcome [a]nd, thus, the results of that arbitration should be applicable against the owner in future arbitrations, just as they would be against the property.\"53 Consequently, Ecuador denies that there can be privity between Perenco and Burlington, which are legally and economically distinct entities; one does not own the other.54\n\n*Ibid*., para. 66. In support of its view, Ecuador refers to the final award of March 14, 2003 in *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. The Czech Republic*, para. 432 (CA-508), and to *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award, June 11, 2012, paras. 1132-1133 (EL-353). See also Rejoinder, paras. 60 and 62.\n\nResponse, para. 68.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 70.\n\n26.\n\nEcuador further argues that the evidence presented in the two proceedings is not identical and it has been presented in different ways to this Tribunal and to the *Burlington* tribunal.55 It also points to the fact that while \"the *Burlington* tribunal relied on the testimony of party-appointed experts and, in addition, sought and obtained detailed explanations and clarifications... in the course of [its] site visit\", \"this Tribunal has refused to place any reliance on the testimony of the Party-appointed experts and has instead resorted to appointing its own independent environmental expert.\"56 Ecuador concludes that accepting the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims as *res judicata* for the purpose of these proceedings \"would... entail transplanting a decision reached by another tribunal on the basis of a different evidentiary record to proceedings which did not follow the same course or pattern.\"57 Ecuador concludes that \"these are adequate reasons to reject the application of *res judicata*.\"58\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 82, 84 *et seq*. See also Rejoinder, para. 53, in which it states that \"the tribunals received starkly different evidence and argument.\"\n\n*Ibid*., para. 88.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 94.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n27.\n\nEcuador disagrees with Perenco's alternative request for relief which the latter formulated in its Reply.59 In Ecuador's view, \"an offset against Perenco for the same counterclaims damages awarded in the *Burlington* Decision is... precluded by the 2015 Interim Decision on Counterclaims rendered by this Tribunal.\"60 It also considers such offset premature in light of the pending annulment proceedings in the *Burlington* case.61\n\nSee para. 14 above.\n\nEcuador's Rejoinder, para. 93.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n28.\n\nIt is of the view that it is inappropriate for the Tribunal to obtain satisfactory guarantees from Ecuador to prevent double recovery. It submits that \"[a]ny specific measures aimed at preventing double recovery... are a matter of the enforcement of the decisions against Perenco and Burlington.\"62\n\n*Ibid*., para. 94.\n\n29.\n\nEcuador considers as inadmissible Perenco's request that the Tribunal order that Ecuador hold Perenco harmless against any future claims based on alleged environmental and infrastructure liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21. It points out that such a claim has never been presented by Perenco in the course of more than five years of proceedings relating to Ecuador's counterclaims. It considers this claim as an entirely new claim, which has been presented too late, contrary to Arbitration Rule 40(2).63\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 95-97.\n\n30.\n\nEcuador requests that the Tribunal to:\n\n\u2022 \"Dismiss Perenco's Application for Dismissal of Ecuador's Counterclaims dated 18 April 2017;\n\n\u2022 Dismiss Perenco's alternative requests for relief;\n\n\u2022 Dismiss Perenco's request that Ecuador hold Perenco harmless against any future claims based on alleged environmental and infrastructure liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21, before any jurisdiction whatsoever whether arbitral or judicial, national or international; and\n\n\u2022 Order Perenco to reimburse Ecuador all the costs and expenses incurred in responding to Perenco's Application, with interest.\"64\n\n*Ibid*., para. 100.\n\n**III. Analysis by the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal starts its analysis with providing a short chronology of events in these proceedings and in the *Burlington* proceedings as they are relevant to considering the Application:\n\n\u2022 January 17, 2011: Ecuador presented, pursuant to Article 40(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, environmental and infrastructure counterclaims against Burlington, when it filed its Counter-Memorial on Liability in the *Burlington* proceedings;65\n\n\u2022 May 26, 2011: although Burlington initially stated that it would challenge the *Burlington* tribunal's jurisdiction, Burlington and Ecuador concluded an agreement by which Burlington accepted the jurisdiction of the tribunal over the counterclaims;66\n\n\u2022 June 24, 2011: Perenco's letter to Ecuador proposing \"that the counterclaims be fully addressed in the *Burlington* Arbitration as to all parties, including Perenco\";67\n\n\u2022 June 29, 2011: Ecuador's letter to Perenco declined this proposal on the grounds that \"[t]he current situation results from Burlington's and Perenco's decision to bring separate claims against Ecuador\" while \"[i]t must have been selfevident to Burlington and Perenco that one consequence of their decision would be that any counterclaims by Ecuador could be brought in the separate proceedings\";68\n\n\u2022 July 13, 2011: Ecuador informed the Tribunal that \"it may submit various counterclaims with its counter-memorial [on liability]\";69\n\n\u2022 July 28, 2011: this Tribunal, in consultation with the Parties, fixed the procedural calendar for counterclaims;\n\n\u2022 September 30, 2011: Ecuador filed a Supplemental Memorial on Counterclaims in the *Burlington* proceedings;\n\n\u2022 December 5, 2011: Ecuador filed a Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims in these proceedings;\n\n\u2022 February 13, 2012: following the Parties' agreement, this Tribunal fixed a new procedural calendar;\n\n\u2022 April 24, 2012: Ecuador filed a Second Supplemental Memorial on Counterclaims in the *Burlington* proceedings;\n\n\u2022 April 27, 2012: Ecuador filed a Supplemental Memorial on Counterclaims in these proceedings;\n\n\u2022 28 September 28, 2012: Perenco filed a Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims;\n\n\u2022 29 September 29, 2012: Burlington filed a Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims;\n\n\u2022 February 22, 2013: Ecuador filed its Reply on Counterclaims in these proceedings;\n\n\u2022 March 18, 2013: Ecuador filed its Reply on Counterclaims in the *Burlington* proceedings;\n\n\u2022 July 8, 2013: Burlington filed its Rejoinder on Counterclaims;\n\n\u2022 July 12, 2013: Perenco filed its Rejoinder on Counterclaims;\n\n\u2022 September 9 to 17, 2013: the hearing on the counterclaims in this proceeding was held in The Hague;\n\n\u2022 November 6, 2013: Perenco and Ecuador filed their Post-Hearing Briefs;\n\n\u2022 November 22, 2013: Perenco and Ecuador filed their Reply Post-Hearing Briefs;\n\n\u2022 June 1 to 7, 2014: the *Burlington* tribunal held hearings on the counterclaims in Paris, originally scheduled for August 26 to 31, 2013 but rescheduled due to the suspension of the proceedings for more than five months following the disqualification of an arbitrator;\n\n\u2022 October 3, 2014: Burlington and Ecuador filed their Post-Hearing Briefs;\n\n\u2022 March 29 to April 1, 2015: the *Burlington* tribunal, accompanied by the parties' representatives and counsel, conducted a site visit;\n\n\u2022 July 15, 2015: Burlington and Ecuador filed Post-Site Visit Briefs;\n\n\u2022 August 11, 2015: this Tribunal issued its Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim (reserving its decision on the infrastructure counterclaim with which it will deal either in its quantum decision or thereafter). In that Decision, the Tribunal made certain findings of fact and Ecuadorian law and recommended that the Parties consider their respective positions and seek to negotiate a settlement in light of what the Tribunal had found. It added that if the Parties did not arrive at a settlement, in light of its doubts about the expert evidence tendered by both Parties, it would proceed to appoint an independent expert who would conduct sampling in accordance with the Tribunal's findings and instructions. The Tribunal was later informed that the Parties were unable to settle their dispute and therefore on July 6, 2016 it proceeded to appoint the expert jointly recommended to it by the Parties\n\n\u2022 September 18, 2015: upon the *Burlington* tribunal's invitation, Burlington and Ecuador filed their comments on this Tribunal's Interim Decision on Ecuador's Environmental Counterclaim;\n\n\u2022 July 6, 2016: as noted above, on this date, the Tribunal appointed an independent environmental expert based on the joint proposal by Perenco and Ecuador. The expert then familiarised himself with the working papers of the Parties' experts in preparation for an initial survey of the sites in Ecuador that are at issue in the environmental counterclaim dispute;\n\n\u2022 November 1 to 5, 2016: the Tribunal's expert and the Parties' representatives and counsel visited the place connected with the dispute;\n\n\u2022 February 7, 2017: the *Burlington* tribunal issued its Decision on Counterclaims and its Decision on Reconsideration and Award;\n\n\u2022 April 18, 2017: upon the Tribunal's invitation, Perenco and Ecuador filed their comments on the *Burlington* tribunal's Decision on Counterclaims and on the Decision on Reconsideration and Award;\n\n\u2022 April 18, 2017: Perenco filed its Application for Dismissal of Ecuador's Counterclaims;\n\n\u2022 From August 2, 2017 until the time of this writing: the Tribunal's expert, with his support team, accompanied by Perenco's and Ecuador's representatives and counsel, have visited Blocks 7 and 21 for the purpose of conducting sampling work.70\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, para. 6 (CL-CC-59).\n\n*Ibid*., and E-428.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-415.\n\nExhibit CE-CC-416.\n\nInterim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, August 11, 2015, para. 6.\n\nBeing interested in the timely completion of these arbitral proceedings, Perenco suggested that \"[i]n any event, briefing on [its] Application should proceed in parallel to [Tribunal's expert] Mr. MacDonald's work\" (Application, para. 6).\n\n32.\n\nThis chronology shows that the proceedings on Ecuador's counterclaims in the two proceedings progressed in parallel, although in the *Burlington v. Ecuador* case, the counterclaims were presented more than 10 months earlier. The Parties were fully aware of this fact.\n\n33.\n\nParallel proceedings are, to the extent possible, to be avoided. However, neither this Tribunal nor the *Burlington* tribunal had the power to order the consolidation of the parts of the proceedings relating to counterclaims *proprio motu*.\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Perenco suggested to Ecuador \"that the counterclaims be fully addressed in the *Burlington* Arbitration\";71 the Tribunal equally notes the reasons provided by Ecuador for declining that suggestion.72\n\nExhibit CE-CC-415 (Perenco's letter was made available to the Tribunal only on April 18, 2017).\n\nExhibit CE-CC-416 (Ecuador's letter was made available to the Tribunal only on April 18, 2017).\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that Perenco never in the past challenged its jurisdiction to hear Ecuador's counterclaims nor their admissibility.\n\n36.\n\nIt should be recalled that the fact that this Tribunal was the first one to hold a hearing on the counterclaims in 2013 and to issue its Interim Decision on Environmental Counterclaims in 2015, the decision in which a number of legal issues under Ecuadorian law were determined with finality, but this did not prevent the *Burlington* tribunal from holding hearings on the counterclaims in 2014 and issuing its own Decision on Counterclaims in 2017.\n\n37.\n\nThe *Burlington* tribunal noted that \"[o]n 11 August 2015, the *Perenco* tribunal issued an Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim... in which it ruled on certain issues of fact and law.\"73 The tribunal further observed that it \"is mindful of the separate nature of the two arbitrations and of its duty to resolve the dispute before it solely on its own record and merits.\"74 It continued that it \"is also mindful of the risk of double recovery., and of the potential risk of contradictory decisions.\"75 And then it added: \"the Tribunal will refer to the *Perenco* Decision in those instances where, in spite of the desire to avoid contradictions, it reaches a conclusion different from that of the *Perenco* tribunal\".76\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, para. 64.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 69.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n38.\n\nThe *Burlington* tribunal's being aware of the risk of double recovery, which the Parties before it acknowledged, stated that it \"lack[ed] the necessary information or basis to adopt any specific measures... to prevent double recovery.\"77 It therefore noted that it must leave the task of preventing double recovery \"to the *Perenco* tribunal as the one deciding in second place\",78 adding that, \"as a matter of principle, [its] Decision cannot serve and may not be used to compensate Ecuador twice for the same damage.\"79\n\n*Ibid*., para. 1086.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n39.\n\nIt seems therefore that the *Burlington* tribunal expected this Tribunal's final decision on counterclaims to be issued subsequently, in which this Tribunal will have to take care of preventing double recovery, taking into account the Decision on Counterclaims in the *Burlington* proceedings.\n\n40.\n\nThis Tribunal, in its Interim Decision, resolved all legal issues which divided the Parties and made a number of legal and factual determinations as far as Ecuador's environmental counterclaim was concerned.\n\n41.\n\nThese issues have been determined by the Tribunal with finality. The Tribunal earlier concluded, when it dealt with Ecuador's Motion for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and Liability that \"it does not have the power to reopen and reconsider its findings\".80 The Tribunal has taken the view that \"[t]here is ample prior authority in support of the view [that] once the tribunal decides with finality any of the factual or legal questions put to it by the parties... such a decision becomes *res judicata*\".81\n\nDecision on Ecuador's Reconsideration Motion, April 10, 2015, para. 97.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 43. The cases (*CMS Gas Transmission v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 12 May 2005; *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States (Waste Management II),* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Decision on Mexico's Preliminary Objection, June 26, 2002; *Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, November 30, 2012; and *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, March 10, 2014; are quoted in paras. 44 to 47 of the Decision on Ecuador's Reconsideration Motion.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal, being consistent, cannot now take a different view as far as the nature of its Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaims is concerned.\n\n43.\n\nSince the Tribunal ruled in the Interim Decision on various legal and factual issues relating to Ecuador's environmental counterclaim, this necessarily implies that it considered this counterclaim admissible. The Tribunal could not have ruled on these various legal and factual issues if it had not been convinced that it had jurisdiction over Ecuador's counterclaim and that it was admissible.\n\n44.\n\nAt no previous stage of the proceedings relating to Ecuador's counterclaims has Perenco raised objections, either to the Tribunal's jurisdiction or to the admissibility of the counterclaims. Perenco was of course aware of the counterclaims raised by Ecuador in the *Burlington* proceedings, admitting that it \"and Burlington... presented a joint defense throughout the counterclaims phase\".82 It has raised its objection to the admissibility of Ecuador's counterclaims only now, after more than five years of arbitrating before this Tribunal, and after the Tribunal had issued its Interim Decision and appointed its Expert to assist it with \"ascertaining the environmental condition of the Blocks [7 and 21] in accordance with the legal and factual findings made by the Tribunal in [its Interim] Decision.\"83\n\nApplication, para. 34\n\nInterim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, para. 611(8).\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal understands Perenco's position that it could not have earlier raised its objection to the admissibility of Ecuador's counterclaims based on the *res judicata* effect of the Decision on the Counterclaims rendered by the *Burlington* tribunal on February 7, 2017 and incorporated into the Award.\n\n46.\n\nThis Tribunal is not, however, convinced that the *Burlington* tribunal's Decision renders Ecuador's counterclaims, the admissibility of which had not been previously challenged and on which the Tribunal ruled in its Interim Decision of August 11, 2015, now inadmissible. At best, the Tribunal could consider that they may have become moot and the Tribunal need not rule on them because its decision/award would be \"devoid of any purpose\".84 But this is not the situation here, for the following reasons.\n\n*Northern Cameroons, Judgment of 2 December 1963, I.C.J. Reports 1963*, p. 38; *Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment of December 20, 1974, I.C.J. Reports 1974,* p. 271, para. 271.\n\n47.\n\nEcuador filed, on February 14, 2017,85 its Application under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention requesting the annulment of the *Burlington* Award, including the Decision on Counterclaims, and requested a stay of enforcement of the Award. Under Article 52(5) of the Convention, in such a case \"enforcement shall be stayed provisionally while the [ *ad hoc* ] Committee rules on such request.\" According to the publicly available information from the ICSID website, the *ad hoc* Annulment Committee held a hearing on the request for the stay of enforcement of the award on July 18, 2017 and is currently deliberating. If the stay is not lifted but continues, the Award, including the Decision on the Counterclaims, is unenforceable. As the Convention's architect, A. Broches, observed \"[a]lthough the Convention does not explicitly so provide, a *stay of enforcement* necessarily carries with it a *suspension of recognition* of the award which means that to the extent of such a stay the *award may not be relied on as a final decision*.\"86 Other authors familiar with the ICSID system have expressed the view that \"a stay [of enforcement] effectively freezes all binding aspects of the award, including its *res judicata* effect.\"87\n\nThe Application for annulment was filed just 7 days after the Award had been dispatched to the Parties, perhaps the 'fastest' annulment application in the history of ICSID. Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he application shall be made within 120 days after the date on which the award was rendered\". In practice, applications are made rather shortly before the expiry of this period.\n\nA. Broches, 'Awards Rendered Pursuant to the ICSID Convention: Binding Force, Finality, Recognition, Enforcement, Execution' in 2 *ICSID Review-Foreign Investment Law Journal*, 1987, p. 294 (emphasis added).\n\nL. Reed, J. Paulsson and N. Blackaby, *Guide to ICSID Arbitration* (Kluwer Law International, 2004), p. 104.\n\n48.\n\nOne may consider that at least one characteristic feature of the award, even if still formally considered *res judicata*, is suspended. As the *ad hoc* Annulment Committee in *MINE v. Guinea* observed \"if an *ad hoc* Committee grants a stay of enforcement, the obligation of the party against whom the Award was rendered to abide and comply with the terms of the Award is *pro tanto* suspended.\"88\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v. Republic of Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Interim Decision No. 1 of the *ad hoc* Committee, August 12, 1988, para. 9.\n\n49.\n\nThe *res judicata* attached to an ICSID award is, however, of a rather particular nature. It is true that Article 53(1) of the Convention provides that \"[t]he award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention\". This provision is usually perceived as expressing the binding nature of the award in terms of *res judicata.*89 The only remedies provided for are revision (Article 51) and annulment (Article 52).90\n\nC. Schreuer *et al*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed., Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 1099.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention, para. 41.\n\n50.\n\nEcuador has availed itself of one of these remedies and requested annulment. Under Article 52(4) of the Convention, the *ad hoc* Annulment Committee \"shall have the authority to annul the award or any part thereof on any of the grounds set forth in paragraph (1)\". If the Award is annulled in full then the *res judicata* nature of that Award is \"destroyed\"91, if it is annulled in part (in the instant case, for example, in respect of the Decision on Counterclaims), that annulled part is deprived of a *res judicata* quality.\n\nC. Schreuer *et al*, *supra* note 89, p. 901.\n\n51.\n\nIn view of this uncertainty of the future status of the *Burlington* Award, in particular the Decision on Counterclaims incorporated into it, the Tribunal considers that it should not declare Ecuador's [environmental] counterclaim as inadmissible in these proceedings, moreover with prejudice, as requested by Perenco. The Tribunal is certainly under no obligation to do so.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus continue in its work, with the assistance of its Expert, and issue in due course its final Decision on Counterclaims, being aware of its duty to eliminate the risk of double recovery.\n\n**IV. Decision**\n----------------\n\n53.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides that:\n\n(a) Perenco's Application for Dismissal of Ecuador's Counterclaims is rejected; and\n\n(b) Costs are reserved for future determination."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2019-09-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **FREQUENTLY USED ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS** | |\n| [CA] [EL] | Legal Authority [Claimant] [Respondent] |\n| [CE] [E] | Exhibit [Claimant] [Respondent] |\n| Amended Request for Arbitration | Claimant's Amended Request for Arbitration, dated 18 July 2008 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (2006) |\n| BIT or the Treaty | Agreement between the Republic of France and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment |\n| Brattle ER II | The Brattle Group Expert Report, prepared by James Dow and Richard Caldwell, dated 4 May 2015 ( |\n| Brattle ER III | The Brattle Group Expert Report, prepared by James Dow and Richard Caldwell, dated 16 October 2015 |\n| Cl.

However, there are many reasons for this which the Tribunal believes are worth noting at the outset.\n\n46.\n\nTwo key reasons arose from the damages estimates in both the primary claim and in the environmental and infrastructure counterclaims. With respect to the former, the Tribunal concluded after the Quantum Hearing that consideration of the damages claimed by Perenco required further in-depth work and the adjustment of the financial models that had been used by the Parties' experts during the quantum phase.\n\n47.\n\nIn the counterclaims proceedings, which continued separately, the Parties were requested to attempt to negotiate a settlement based on the findings of law and fact made in the Tribunal's Interim Decision on Counterclaim, failing which the Tribunal would appoint an independent expert to assist in evaluating Blocks 7 and 21 (\"**Blocks**\") and estimating any environmental damage assessed in accordance with the Interim Decision on Counterclaim. A negotiated settlement proved not to be possible. It took the Parties some time to jointly identify a suitable independent expert who could be appointed by the Tribunal, as contemplated in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim.\n\n48.\n\nThis Independent Expert was to assess the work performed by the Parties' experts and to conduct further sampling in Ecuador in accordance with the Tribunal's findings set out in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim. This work was conducted from August to mid-December 2017 and the Independent Expert Report was not received until 19 December 2018. Thereafter, the Tribunal gave the Parties an opportunity to insert comments into the Independent Expert Report as well as to submit general comments on his work, and convened a two-day hearing in The Hague at which the Independent Expert provided a 90-minute presentation of his findings and responded to the Parties' written comments, after which the Parties were given opportunities to put questions to the Independent Expert. The Tribunal then deliberated in respect of the counterclaims, considered the Parties' submissions on costs, and finalised this Award.\n\n49.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, in the Tribunal's view, it made sense to deal with all outstanding damages issues in a single Award.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that this has been too slow a process for at least one of the Parties, but when substantial amounts have been claimed (approximately US$1.5 billion in the principal claim and US$2.5 billion in the counterclaim), careful consideration and due deliberation is required.\n\n51.\n\nRelatedly, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to recount the principal steps taken in this long arbitration:\n\n(a) The Request for Arbitration was filed on 30 April 2008.\n\n(b) This was registered on 4 June 2008.\n\n(c) An Amended Request for Arbitration was filed on 28 July 2008.\n\n(d) The Tribunal was constituted on 21 November 2008.\n\n(e) The first session was held on 7 February 2009.\n\n(f) The Request for Provisional Measures was filed on 19 February 2009.\n\n(g) A hearing on provisional measures was held in Paris on 19 March 2009 which resulted in a 41-page decision of the Tribunal on 8 May 2009 (\"**Decision on Provisional Measures**\").\n\n(h) One arbitrator resigned on 16 December 2009 and the proceedings were suspended. The arbitrator was replaced by Mr. Neil Kaplan CBE QC SBS on 13 January 2010.\n\n(i) The late Lord Bingham, who presided over the first phase of the arbitration, resigned due to ill health on 17 February 2010. H.E. Judge Peter Tomka was appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council on 6 May 2010.\n\n(j) A hearing on jurisdiction was held in The Hague on 2-4 November 2010. The Tribunal rendered its first Decision on Jurisdiction, some 44 pages, on 30 June 2011.\n\n(k) While the primary claim was in train, on 5 December 2011, Ecuador filed counterclaims for alleged environmental harm and infrastructure damages. This was fully briefed by the Parties and a hearing was held in The Hague commencing 9 September 2013 and concluding on 17 September 2013.\n\n(l) After further briefing by the Parties, the hearing on the merits of the primary claim coupled with the remaining jurisdictional issues which had been set over to the merits phase, was heard in The Hague commencing on 8 November 2012 and concluding on 16 November 2012. The Decision on Liability, running to 234 pages, was dispatched to the Parties on 12 September 2014. Some delay in the rendering of this decision was occasioned by the translation of the English original into Spanish.\n\n(m) On 19 December 2014, Ecuador sought a reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Liability. After receiving submissions from the Parties, the request was considered and then dismissed in a 24-page decision on 10 April 2015.\n\n(n) On 11 August 2015, an Interim Decision on Counterclaim running to 187 pages and which also had to be translated into Spanish running to 211 pages was dispatched to the Parties.\n\n(o) As noted above, the Tribunal instructed the Parties to consider the findings of law and fact made in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim with a view to encouraging them to negotiate a settlement in light of the Tribunal's findings. The Parties agreed to do so but were unable to arrive at a settlement. As a result, the Tribunal proceeded to act in accordance with the alternative process envisaged in the Interim Decision on counterclaim, namely, that it would appoint its own expert to evaluate the environmental condition of the two Blocks.\n\n(p) The damages phase of this arbitration was heard for one week in Paris commencing 9 November 2015.\n\n(q) The oral closing submissions on damages was heard in The Hague on 21 April 2016.\n\n(r) Immediately following the closing submissions on damages, the Tribunal conducted its first set of in-person deliberations on quantum. In the course of doing so, it concluded that having regard to the work undertaken by the Parties' quantum experts up to closing submissions, the further elaboration of that work was in order and correspondence on this matter with the Parties ensued.\n\n(s) Shortly after the Quantum Hearing for the primary claim, having consulted on the matter, on 25 April 2016, the Parties jointly proposed to the Tribunal the appointment of Mr. Scott MacDonald of Ramboll as the Tribunal-appointed expert to conduct the sampling contemplated by the Tribunal in the event that the Parties could not agree on a settlement of the environmental counterclaim. The Tribunal conferred with Mr. MacDonald as to how he would approach the exercise in light of the Tribunal's instructions laid out in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim.\n\n(t) On 6 July 2016, Mr. MacDonald was appointed as the Tribunal's Independent Expert by Procedural Order No. 16.\n\n(u) From 1 November 2016 to 5 November 2016, Mr. MacDonald visited Ecuador to inspect the two Blocks for purposes of working out his subsequent work plan.\n\n(v) The Tribunal continued its quantum deliberations at a meeting held on 25 and 26 November 2016 and further analytical work ensued.\n\n(w) On 7 February 2017, the *Burlington* tribunal rendered its Decision on Reconsideration and Award.1 After reflection, the Tribunal decided to seek the Parties' views as to what, if anything, in that award was relevant to the Tribunal's consideration of the matters before it, given that Burlington and Perenco constituted the members of the Consortium which operated Blocks 7 and 21 and many of the facts are common to the two disputes. Submissions on the point were received from the Parties on 18 April 2017.\n\n(x) Also on 18 April 2017, Perenco filed its First Dismissal Application. Perenco submitted with respect to the environmental and infrastructure counterclaim that the *Burlington* award was *res judicata* for the Parties to the present proceeding and thus the Tribunal's Interim Decision on Counterclaim had been overtaken by the *Burlington* tribunal's determinations of the Consortium's liability (as established in a claim brought by Ecuador against Perenco's fellow Consortium member and alleged privy, Burlington). It asserted that therefore the environmental expert's work should be terminated.\n\n(y) The Tribunal laid down a schedule for further submissions on the point by both Parties, which was transmitted to the Parties on 3 May 2017, after the Parties failed to agree on a schedule.\n\n(z) On 23 May 2017, Ecuador filed a response to Perenco's First Dismissal Application.\n\n(aa) On 10 and 11 June 2017, the Tribunal held an in-person deliberation on quantum in The Hague.\n\n(bb) On 13 June 2017, Perenco submitted a reply on Ecuador's response to Perenco's First Dismissal Application.\n\n(cc) On 4 July 2017, Ecuador submitted a rejoinder thereto.\n\n(dd) On 18 August 2017, the Tribunal dismissed Perenco's First Dismissal Application.\n\n(ee) Meanwhile, starting on August 2017, Mr. MacDonald and his team began conducting field work at identified sites for the purpose of preparing the sampling activities.\n\n(ff) On 30 January 2018, Perenco filed its Second Dismissal Application. This was on the basis that Burlington's settlement with Ecuador, and payment in full of Burlington and Perenco's joint debt on the counterclaims, extinguished whatever joint liability Perenco as well as Burlington had to Ecuador, and rendered Ecuador's further pursuit of the counterclaims moot.\n\n(gg) On 5 February 2018, following the Tribunal's invitation, Ecuador provided its comments on the Second Dismissal Application and proposed an alternative briefing schedule following the Parties' failure to agree on a briefing schedule.\n\n(hh) On 8 February 2018 and on 12 February 2018, the Parties provided further comments on the way forward with the Second Dismissal Application.\n\n(ii) On 15 February 2018, the Tribunal laid down the briefing schedule after considering the Parties' comments and decided that Mr. MacDonald's work was to continue. There would be no disclosure in relation to the application nor an oral hearing.\n\n(jj) Pursuant to this, on 15 March 2018, Ecuador filed its response to Perenco's Second Dismissal Application.\n\n(kk) On 5 April 2018, Perenco filed its Reply.\n\n(ll) On 26 April 2018, Ecuador filed its Rejoinder.\n\n(mm) On 30 July 2018, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Perenco's Second Dismissal Application, deciding, by a majority, to reject the application.\n\n(nn) On 19 December 2018, after receiving the Independent Expert Report, the Tribunal dispatched it to the Parties to seek their comments thereon. After receiving the Parties' comments thereon, and as requested by the Parties, the Tribunal held a hearing on the Independent Expert Report on 11-12 March 2019. The Tribunal also met on 13-15 March 2019 and 3 June 2019 for the final in-person meetings.\n\n(oo) On 19 April and 10 May 2019, the Tribunal received the Parties' costs submissions and reply costs submissions in the form requested by the Tribunal.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Reconsideration and Award, 7 February 2017 (\"*Burlington* award\"), CA-CC-60. The *Burlington* tribunal also issued on the same date a Decision on Counterclaims, CA-CC-59 (\"*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims\") which was made an integral part of the *Burlington* award.\n\n52.\n\nThe following comments are *apropos* :\n\n(a) There have been a total of 7 hearings in this case;\n\n(b) The pleadings in this case have been voluminous and have run to not less than 3816 pages;\n\n(c) There have been no less than 55 witness statements running to not less than 1028 pages excluding exhibits;\n\n(d) The experts' reports in this case total 53. They run in total to no less than 2539 pages excluding exhibits;\n\n(e) The evidential record in this arbitration, excluding the items listed above, exceeds 125,302 pages; and\n\n(f) There have been numerous interlocutory skirmishes between the Parties, unfortunately caused by lack of agreement between them on a number of procedural issues, which have occupied the Tribunal's time.\n\n53.\n\nAs recorded above, since the completion of the written and oral pleadings, the Tribunal has deliberated in-person as well as by electronic means. This has been a complex and hard-fought case. The Tribunal has considered all the points raised by the Parties even though it has only referred to the most important submissions and points for purposes of its Award.\n\n54.\n\n**Part II** of this Award contains the Tribunal's assessment of the damages due to Perenco for the breaches of Treaty and contract. **Part III** contains the Tribunal's assessment of the damages payable by Perenco to Ecuador for the environmental damage caused by the Consortium's operations. **Part IV** contains the Tribunal's consideration of the infrastructure counterclaim by Ecuador. **Part V** contains the Tribunal's decision on the Parties' respective claims and submissions on costs. This Award follows on from the Tribunal's 30 June 2011 Decision on Jurisdiction, the 12 September 2014 Decision on Liability, the 10 April 2015 Decision on Reconsideration, the 11 August 2015 Interim Decision on Counterclaim, the decisions on Perenco's two requests for dismissal of the Respondent's counterclaims of 18 August 2017 and of 30 July 2018, and all of them should be read with and taken as an integral part of this Award.\n\n**II. DAMAGES CLAIMED IN RELATION TO THE BREACH OF THE TREATY AND THE PARTICIPATION CONTRACTS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. **The Parties' Positions in the Damages Phase**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe damages phase follows from the Tribunal's Decision on Liability in which the *dispositif* declared that the following breaches had occurred: (i) breach of the Block 7 and 21 Participation Contracts2 in respect of Law 42 at 99%, (ii) breach of the Block 21 Participation Contract as a result of the declaration of *caducidad* ; (iii) breach of Article 4 of the Treaty3 in respect of Law 42 at 99%, and (iv) breach of Article 6 of the Treaty as a result of the declaration of *caducidad*.4\n\nSee Contract Modifying the Service Contract to a Participation for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 7 of the Amazon Region, including the Contract for the Coca-Payamino Unified Field (\"**Block 7 Participation Contract**\") and the Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon Region (\"**Block 21 Participation Contract**\"). Collectively referred to as the \"**Participation Contracts\"** or \"**PSCs**.\"\n\nAgreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Republic of Ecuador on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"**Treaty**\" or \"**BIT**\").\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 606 and paragraph 713, in particular, paragraphs 713(4), (6), (8), (12) and (14). The Tribunal also found that certain acts of Ecuador taken between the application of Decree 662 and *caducidad* also violated the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n**1. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nWith Ecuador's responsibility having been engaged, Perenco initially requested an Award of US$1,572 billion in damages.5\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 278(b): updated proxy date of 1 July 2015 (and other adjustments).\n\n57.\n\nRelying upon the testimony of Mr. John Crick (an advisor to the Chief Executive Officer of Perenco6), the expert reports of Dr. Richard Strickland, and the expert economic and financial reports of Professor Joseph Kalt of Compass Lexecon, Perenco claimed that it is entitled to US$1,572 billion, calculated on an *ex post* basis, to compensate it for its losses arising out of Ecuador's breaches of its international law and contractual obligations.\n\nCrick WS II, paragraph 1. Mr. Crick joined Perenco in 1986 and was responsible for all of the geoscience aspects of the company's growth until 1995. From 1995 to 2003, Mr. Crick was the technical manager responsible for the geoscience aspects of the company's development activity. In 2003, he created and headed a long-term planning group. He has been in his present position since 2008. (See also Crick WS II, paragraph 4).\n\n58.\n\nPerenco's Request for Arbitration had sought declarations that obligations under the Treaty and the Participation Contracts had been breached, an order that Ecuador declare null and void the relevant measures, the reinstatement of Perenco's rights under the Participation Contracts, an order that Ecuador abide by and perform the terms of the Participation Contracts, and damages.7 Perenco had also sought Provisional Measures against Ecuador, seeking to restrain any action to collect Law 42 dues as well as any action to amend, rescind, terminate or repudiate the Participation Contracts.8\n\nRequest for Arbitration dated 30 April 2008, paragraph 42; Amended Request for Arbitration dated 28 July 2008, paragraph 42.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, paragraph 43; Amended Request for Arbitration, paragraph 43. Claimant's Application for Provisional Measures dated 19 February 2009.\n\n59.\n\nDue to various events, the nature of the relief sought changed over time. Ultimately, when it came to the quantum phase, Perenco no longer sought reinstatement of its rights under the Participation Contracts, which had been terminated in July 2010, but instead sought damages \"in an amount that would wipe out all the consequences of Respondent's illegal acts and re-establish the situation which would have existed if those acts had not been committed, valued as of the date of the award, in the amount of US$1.6984 billion, subject to updating closer to the date of the award.\"9 This amount was then adjusted to US$1,572 billion.10\n\nCl. Mem. Q., paragraph 182(b).\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 278 (b).\n\n60.\n\nThis figure of US$1,572 billion was further adjusted downwards to US$1,423 billion as of 18 April 2016. During closing arguments at the Quantum Closing, counsel for the Claimant stated that:\n\n\"\u2026with current oil prices, Perenco, in an extension scenario, we have to confess, likely would not have pursued the Coca and Payamino waterfloods. \u2026 in the but-for world, Perenco would be developing these waterfloods as we speak at this time, and in today's world of relatively low oil prices, those wells would likely not be economic. Perenco, therefore, has to be true to the ex post principles that it has espoused, and we feel it's a matter of integrity, and, therefore, we would leave those projects to the side or suggest that you do in valuing damages in an extension case.\"11\n\nTr. Q. (6) 1641:17-20, 1642:6-14 (Claimant's Closing Argument).\n\n61.\n\nPerenco also requests that post-award interest be at commercial, annually compounding rates, that Ecuador pay all legal and related costs, and all amounts paid by Ecuador pursuant to the Award be net of any Ecuadorian tax or other fiscal obligations. Finally, Perenco also seeks dismissal of Ecuador's counterclaims.\n\n62.\n\nAs the damages phase progressed, Professor Kalt helpfully set out his view of the principal points that divided the Parties. As shown in the table extract from his fourth expert report:12\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Revised Kalt Damages** | **$1,572.4** |\n| ***Key Brattle Assumptions*** | ***Standalone Effect on Damages ($Millions)*** |\n| *Ex Ante* Valuation | -$874.9 |\n| RPS Production Levels | -$910.0 |\n| No Stabilization of Law 42 at 50% | -$724.4 |\n| No Block 7 Extension | -$626.0 |\n| Remaining Effect of Other Assumptions | -$44.513 |\n\nKalt ER IV, Exhibit JK-64.\n\nOther elements of the DCF analysis on which Brattle and Professor Kalt disagreed include the treatment of future oil prices, operating costs, capital costs, the tax treatment of tariffs on the OCP pipeline, and pre-award interest. See Kalt ER IV, paragraph 101ff.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent has requested the following different forms of relief, depending upon the Tribunal's findings on key issues. In sum and primarily, it requests that no compensation be awarded to Perenco in order to account for the unpaid amounts of Law 42 dues that Perenco owes Ecuador.14 However, should the Tribunal be inclined to award any compensation at all, such compensation should be calculated in accordance with Ecuador's submissions.15\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraph 183. Ecuador had earlier sought during the Liability Phase declarations that the enactment of Law 42 and implementing decrees and the institution of *coactiva* procedures did not breach the Participation Contracts or the Treaty.\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraph 184. Ecuador asserts that the Quantum Hearing showed that Perenco's real claim amounted to a maximum of $343 million (Resp. PHB Q., paragraph 1).\n\n64.\n\nIn response to Professor Kalt, the Respondent's experts, Professor James Dow and Mr. Richard Caldwell of The Brattle Group (\"**Brattle**\"), presented a \"waterfall chart\" (the \"**Waterfall Chart**\") depicting the effects on quantum of certain decisions which Ecuador contended the Tribunal should take in relation to various aspects of the claim as presented by Perenco. The Respondent's initial version of the Waterfall Chart (dated 15 September 2015) was later updated to reflect the situation as of 18 April 2016.16\n\nRespondent's Closing Presentation Q., Slide 101.\n\n65.\n\nWere the Tribunal to accept each of Ecuador's criticisms of Perenco's case on damages, the amount estimated by Professor Kalt would be reduced significantly:\n\nB. **The Main Issues that Separated the Parties**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nAt the Quantum Hearing and at the Quantum Closing, it became clear that the main issues that separated the Parties in relation to the estimation of damages are relatively few.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent's Waterfall Chart (above) identified five main issues that divided the Parties:\n\n1. The general approach to the valuation of damages: *i.e*., whether damages are to be assessed *ex ante* or *ex post*, and whether on a 'layering' basis;\n\n2. Whether in the 'but for' world, there would have been an extension of the Block 7 Contract (which was due to expire in August 2010), and if so, the nature of such an extension and its terms;\n\n3. Whether, in estimating the damages for expropriation, the Tribunal should accept Mr. Crick's 'but for' drilling programme for both Blocks 7 and Block 21 or RPS' more modest drilling programme;\n\n4. Whether all, or just a portion, of the effects of Law 42 at 99% should be assumed away in the 'but for' analysis; and\n\n5. Whether a 'true-up' in favour of Ecuador should be applied, the effect of which would be to adjust the damages owed to Perenco.\n\n68.\n\nBy the time of the closing day's submissions, counsel for Perenco had narrowed the list to four issues: (i) *restitution*, \"under which Perenco's damages should be calculated at Award date rather than breach date\"; (ii) *production*, \"whereby the number of wells Perenco would have drilled and the volumes of oil they would have produced should be based on Mr. Crick's forecast and not those of RPS\"; (iii) *absorption*, \"pursuant to which Perenco's contractual right to absorption of all Law 42 amounts should be valued rather than ignored\"; and (iv) *extension*, \"by which Perenco should be accorded value for the extension of the Block 7 Contract to which it was entitled and that it and Ecuador both wanted and would have agreed absent Ecuador's breaches.\"17\n\nTr. Q. (6) 1623:15-1624:8.\n\nC. **The Tribunal's Starting Point**\n------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by recalling that it is well understood in the jurisprudence on damages generally, that the assessment of damages whether in contract, tort or under a treaty, is \"not an exact science.\"18 Nor is it an exercise in economic theory to which the Tribunal was much subjected by the Parties in this case. The Tribunal did not find the extensive reference to economic theory developed principally in the analysis of U.S. judicial decisions to be helpful to it when estimating a reasonable figure to compensate Perenco for the damage which it has suffered as a result of Ecuador's breaches. The Tribunal found the debate over \"opportunistic\" and \"efficient\" breach, however interesting to economists, legal theorists and judges in the United States, to be of no real value to the Tribunal and irrelevant to its task of deciding the quantum of damages to which Perenco was entitled.19 That said, the Tribunal has profited from the experts' highly professional work on the key issues that the Tribunal has ultimately had to decide in arriving at this Award.\n\nEL-281, *Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Award, 28 March 2011, paragraph 248:  \n\"While the existence of damage is certain, calculating the precise amount of the compensation is fraught with much more difficulty, inherent in the very nature of the 'but for' hypothesis. Valuation is not an exact science. The Tribunal has no crystal ball and cannot claim to know what would have happened under a hypothesis of no breach; the best any tribunal can do is to make an informed and conscientious evaluation, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, not unlike that made by anyone who assesses the value of a business on the basis of its likely future earnings.\"\n\nWhile the Claimant has contended that the Participation Contracts are governed by Ecuadorian law, it has also asserted that Ecuadorian law on damages articulates essentially the same standard of, and approach to, reparation as the international law standard expressed in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case (Cl. Mem. Q., paragraph 17; Cl. PHB Q., paragraph 2). In contrast, the Respondent has proceeded on the basis of international law while disagreeing that Ecuadorian law articulates the same standard of full reparation as international law (Resp. C-Mem. Q., paragraphs 17, 28-29). Given the Parties' focus on the international law issues arising in the quantum phase, the Tribunal has likewise focused on those issues.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal will begin by setting out in general terms how it intends to deal with the principal issues identified by the Parties. In view of the various determinations made in this Award and the adjustments that had to be made to the financial models employed by the experts to incorporate such changes, the Tribunal considers it to be unnecessary to recite all of the arguments advanced by the Parties.\n\n71.\n\nCertain issues are addressed at the outset. These concern: (i) the date(s) of valuation of damages; (ii) the Tribunal's decision to employ two valuation dates; and (iii) the use of contemporaneous evidence. Having addressed these issues, the Tribunal will then summarise its general approach to the balance of the issues relating to the quantification of damages.\n\n**1. The Date of Valuation**\n----------------------------\n\n72.\n\nPerhaps the most significant issue that divided the Parties concerned the date(s) of valuation. Perenco and its expert (on instructions) chose a single date, namely, the date of the expropriation on 10 July 2010. Contending that the expropriation was unlawful and having regard to the restitutionary relief that it initially had sought, Perenco argued that it should be entitled to the higher of the value of Perenco's interests in the two Blocks: as of the date of the declaration of *caducidad* or as of the date of the Award.20 In this regard, Perenco's expert, Professor Kalt, described what he saw as the inter-related nature of the various breaches found by the Tribunal; this led him to aggregate the breaches and to treat them as culminating in the formal taking of Perenco's interests in the Participation Contracts effected by the declaration of *caducidad*.\n\nCl. Mem. Q., paragraphs 11 & 22; Cl. Rep. Q., paragraphs 34-35 and 46-47. Perenco relies on the approach taken by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the case of the *Factory at Chorz\u00f2w* which contemplated a different calculation of the damages for an unlawful expropriation than that which would be made in relation to a lawful one. See also Tr. Q. (6)1625 *et seq*. (Claimant's Closing Argument).\n\n73.\n\nThe valuation issue was bound up in the Parties' debate over so-called 'layering'. While Perenco argued for a single date (based on the expropriation), for its part, Ecuador and its experts (on instructions) asserted that Perenco and Professor Kalt had wrongly grouped together various independent breaches occurring over approximately two and a half years as if the Tribunal had found a creeping expropriation; this despite the Tribunal's having explicitly rejected Perenco's claim on that point and having held that the *coactivas* and Ecuador's taking over the operatorship of the Blocks after Perenco had suspended operations could not be counted towards a finding of indirect or creeping expropriation.21 As counsel for Ecuador put it in closing argument:\n\n\"\u2026to be clear, Decree 662 was not enacted, as Perenco suggests implicitly in its arguments, with the intention of expropriating at some later point [,] here in 2010, Perenco's investments. This is not a case of creeping expropriation. What you need to do is calculate from October 2007 onwards and then, to avoid double-counting, calculate from July 2010 onwards without double-computing the impact of Decree 662.\"22\n\nResp. C-Mem. Q., paragraphs 4, 34-35, 207; Resp. Rej. Q., paragraph 132.\n\nTr. Q. (6) 1828:10-18.\n\n74.\n\nIn accordance with Article 36(1) of the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the \"**ILC Articles**\"), the Tribunal considers that it should award compensation insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution, which compensation should cover \"financially assessable damages including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\" The Tribunal recalls that it is well-established that the burden of proving damages lies with the claiming party.23 In the absence of a creeping or indirect expropriation effected by a series of discrete measures, the orthodox approach is for a claimant to identify the damages caused by each breach at the time of its occurrence.24 It is moreover the case that the focus of the inquiry must be on damages *proximately* caused by the breaches found by the Tribunal.25\n\nEL-265, *S.D.

Quite the contrary. The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador as to the suitability, in the circumstances of the present case, of valuing the breaches as and when they occurred, rather than focusing exclusively on the last completed breach. The Tribunal considers that counsel for Ecuador's characterisation of the facts, quoted above at paragraph 73, is correct. Even during the provisional measures phase of this proceeding, counsel for Ecuador confirmed that their client had no intention at that time to expropriate Perenco's interests in the Blocks. The Tribunal adverted to this intention not to expropriate in the Decision on Liability when discussing whether the Ministry should have stayed its hand in declaring *caducidad* during the pendency of these arbitral proceedings.26\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 709, quoting Ecuador's letter to the Tribunal: \"Ecuador intends to carry out the enforcement of Law 42 in such a way as to avoid any disruption of Perenco's business. In particular, Ecuador does not intend to seize any assets of the Consortium beyond oil equivalent in value to the outstanding debt. Nor does Ecuador intend to terminate the relevant Participation Contracts, or take legal action against Perenco representatives.\" CE-212, Letter from Respondents regarding the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures and Law 42, 15 May 2009.\n\n76.\n\nAs previously held by the Tribunal, Perenco failed to make out a creeping expropriation claim and its attempt now to employ in its stead what it called an \"inter-linked course of conduct\" is unavailing.27 The breaches are of course inter-linked in that each is a part of the dispute as it evolved, but each has to be examined at its own time and in its own context. This is particularly the case when it is recalled that certain acts claimed to be in breach of contract or of the Treaty were not accepted as such by the Tribunal. For example, while the Tribunal accepted that Perenco could lawfully suspend operations under the *exceptio non adempleti contractus* doctrine, it also accepted that the State could in such circumstances lawfully intervene in the Blocks so as to safeguard their operating continuity and productivity after the Consortium suspended operations.28 Similarly, the Tribunal held that the *coactiva* dispute, which arose when Perenco's decision not to pay Law 42 dues led Ecuador to seek to liquidate the claimed 2008 tax debt, resulted from the acts of both Parties. The Tribunal held that neither of these acts could be counted towards Perenco's theory of a creeping expropriation.29\n\nTr. Q. (6) 1712:4. See the Decision on Liability, paragraph 710, rejecting the creeping expropriation argument advanced by Perenco.\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraphs 705, 710.\n\n*Ibid*., paragraph 703.\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls further that when analysing whether Perenco had made out its claim of a breach of the Treaty in relation to Law 42 at 50%, the Tribunal adverted to the conflation of different events occurring at different times.30 The Tribunal has had the same sense in the quantum phase of the proceeding. It considers that Decree 662 and *caducidad*, separated as they were by a period of over two years, cannot be lumped together so as to land on a single date that is then used to value the breaches' collective impact.\n\n*Ibid*., paragraph 580: \"In advancing its allegation of breach, the Claimant tended to conflate a series of measures which were taken at different times over a course of some four years. In its pleadings, the Claimant tended to lump together: (i) Law 42 at 50%; (ii) the promulgation and application of Decree 662; (iii) the Correa administration's demands for the migration of participation contracts to a service contract model; (iv) the subsequent demand for a faster migration to service contracts than that initially sought; (v) the demands for payment of levies claimed to have been owed under Law 42; (vi) the launching of *coactivas* ; (vii) the decision to enforce the coactivas notwithstanding the Tribunal's recommendation that it not do so during the pendency of the arbitration; and (viii) the breakdown in negotiations which led to the Consortium's decision to suspend operations, which in turn led to the initiation of the proceeding resulting in the declaration of *caducidad*.\"\n\n78.\n\nNot only did the Tribunal differentiate in its Decision on Liability between Decree 662, the first completed breach, and *caducidad*, the last completed breach, it also distinguished between Decree 662 and the other fair and equitable treatment breaches that followed before Perenco suspended operations. The Ministry declared *caducidad* a year later after requesting Perenco to return to the Blocks on four separate occasions, requests that Perenco refused to countenance unless Ecuador complied with the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures. It was only after the Ministry gave these warnings and Perenco refused to resume operations that the Ministry made a declaration of *caducidad*.31 To point this out is not to excuse the Ministry \u2013 the Tribunal has agreed with Perenco that the *caducidad* amounted to an expropriation under Article 6 of the Treaty \u2013 but rather to make the point that Perenco's decision to suspend operations compelled the government to intervene to protect the Blocks and their production, and the warnings that Perenco should resume operations or face a declaration of *caducidad* were based on one of the grounds for termination listed in Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law.32\n\n*Ibid*., paragraph 707.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 706.\n\n79.\n\nOf specific relevance to the proposed single date of valuation based on the \"inter-linked course of conduct\" argument, the Tribunal notes that the fair and equitable treatment breaches themselves were not treated as all in one package in the Decision on Liability. In addition to rejecting the creeping expropriation contention, the Tribunal differentiated between the offending measures as follows:\n\n\"606\u2026.Decree 662 marked the beginning of a series of other measures in breach of Article 4 taken in relation to the Participation Contracts, namely: (i) demanding that the contractors agree to surrender their rights under their participation contracts and migrate to what for a considerable period of time was an unspecified model, such that the contractors were unable to discern precisely what they were being asked to move to; (ii) escalating negotiating demands, in particular in April 2008 when the President unexpectedly suspended the negotiations and rejected what had recently been achieved in a Partial Agreement in respect of one of the blocks; (iii) making coercive and threatening statements, including threats of expulsion from Ecuador; and (iv) taking steps to enforce Law 42 against Perenco (and Burlington) for non-payment of dues claimed to be owing, a portion of which has been held to be in breach of Article 4, and when no payments were made, forcibly seizing and selling the oil produced in Blocks 7 and 21 in order to realise the claimed Law 42 debt. This set the stage for the Consortium's suspension of operations and ultimately the declaration of *caducidad* which formally terminated the Consortium's rights in the two blocks.\n\n607. The Tribunal has already noted that Ecuador has not contested the Claimant's assertion that Decree 662 was intended to force a renegotiation of the participation contracts in order to migrate Petroecuador's counterparties to service contracts. In the Tribunal's view, moving beyond 50% to 99% with the application of Decree 662 amounted to a breach of Article 4 of the Treaty *and the measures, taken collectively, just listed also* constituted breaches of Article 4.\" [Double emphasis added.]\n\n80.\n\nAs the underlined and italicised passages indicate, the Tribunal distinguished between Decree 662 and the measures that followed. This is not to suggest that none of these were related to the others, but the Tribunal was alive to the fact that some of the breaches (and other alleged breaches which were not accepted as such) arose out of complex interactions between the Consortium and/or the individual acts of its members, Perenco and Burlington, and the State.33\n\nThe first led to the *coactivas* aimed at collecting the claimed tax debt which the Tribunal has found to be a breach of contract (at paragraph 579 of the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal found that it was not necessary to consider the measures as a breach of treaty); the second was found to be a breach but one that Perenco was found to have contributed to; and the third, the State's intervention to operate the Blocks was found to be a lawful response to Perenco's suspension of operations. Decision on Liability, paragraphs 417, 697 and 708.\n\n81.\n\nThe facts and the findings were thus somewhat more complicated than the way in which they have sometimes been treated in the course of the quantum pleadings. The Tribunal has accordingly found it necessary to revert to specific prior findings from time to time so as to provide context for certain findings made in this Award.\n\n82.\n\nQuite apart from the issues of context and timing, the Tribunal considers that Decree 662 had the effect of converting the Participation Contracts into *de facto* service contracts (and, as Perenco pointed out during the quantum phase, imperfect ones at that, because they provided no protection against lower oil prices34), but the decree did not purport to interfere with the Contracts' operation below the reference price.35 Perenco continued to both hold and exercise those contractual rights up to the date of its decision to suspend operations (and thereafter, in that Ecuador credited Perenco's account with revenues derived from sales of crude oil while it operated the Blocks after the Consortium suspended operations and up to the declaration of *caducidad*).36\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 132.\n\nAs noted in an email report sent shortly after Perenco representatives met with the Minister of Mines: \"If we drill the OSO23 we must explain to the state that this is the last one and that we do it because of contractual obligation with the drilling contractor, and that it is obviously difficult to stop a campaign so quickly. In other words we don't want the state to believe that we carry on drilling because it is still profitable.\" [Emphasis added.] Exhibit BR-26, Email dated 9 October 2007. See *Murphy Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador (II)*, PCA Case No. 2012 \u201316 (formerly AA 434), Partial Final Award, 6 May 2016, paragraphs 276 \u2013 280 (hereinafter *Murphy v. Ecuador*), which is in accord with the approach taken by the Tribunal in its Decision on Liability.\n\nE-398, Updated Table \u2013 Auctions Block 7; E-399, Updated Table-Auctions Block 21.\n\n83.\n\nThus, the Tribunal did not see a set of inter-linked measures so closely connected in time as to convince it to aggregate them and employ the single valuation date for which Perenco contended. Nor did it consider that the challenges of valuing the breaches individually was of such complexity as to require the damages estimation exercise to default to a single date of valuation.\n\n84.\n\nTribunals are not bound to accept a party's proposed date of valuation. In *Sempra*, for example, while the tribunal ultimately agreed with the claimant's proposed date, it observed:\n\n\"209. The Tribunal will accordingly use December 31, 2001 as the proper valuation date. This is not because it believes that the Claimant's argument should be given any deference, but simply because the explanation given shows that there was an investment decision made in good faith. Neither does the Tribunal share the interpretation which the Claimant has given to *CMS* with regard to the payment of certain deference in the choice of a valuation date. It is apparent that in *CMS* no acts or decisions taken by the claimant after the injunction raised any doubt about the date which triggered the events complained of.\"37\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 28 September 2007, paragraph 209. See also EL-290, *Anatolie Stati, Gabriel Stati, Ascom Group S.A. and Terra Raf Trans Trading Ltd v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, SCC Case No. V116/2010, Award, 19 December 2013, paragraphs 1493-1498.\n\n85.\n\nHaving regard to all of the circumstances and to its prior findings, the Tribunal therefore prefers the kind of 'layering' analysis proposed by Ecuador's experts, albeit with important modifications to Brattle's approach. The Tribunal intends to value the first completed breach and then adjust it in certain ways for reasons explained below. It will then turn to the subsequent breaches and do the same (if there is evidence of financially assessable damage proximately caused by each breach). It considers that this approach is consonant with international law and legal practice.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that bound up in the Parties' debate over 'layering' were arguments as to whether Brattle acted consistently with their declared intention to value the breaches separately on an *ex ante* basis. Perenco criticised Brattle for its having focused on the two breaches of Decree 662 and *caducidad* specified in the Decision on Liability's *dispositif* without estimating the economic effects of the intervening breaches (demanding that contracts migrate to services contracts, making escalating contractual demands, and making coercive and threatening statements).38 Yet, the Tribunal would note that this criticism overlooks the point noted above at paragraph 74 that it is not incumbent upon a respondent to make a claimant's case on damages; that burden is the claimant's.39 Indeed, a respondent is entitled to simply challenge the claimant's approach if it sees fit to do so without proffering an alternative estimation of the damages that might be payable. Perenco was put on notice of the 'layering' approach by the Respondent's first responsive pleading in the damages phase.40 The fact that Brattle did not attempt to value escalating contract demands, for example, did not preclude Perenco from seeking to do so.41 However, while it criticised Brattle's approach in its Quantum Reply, Perenco continued to base its damages case on a single valuation date, thus running the risk that the Tribunal might be persuaded by Brattle's approach and thus be presented with no attempt to value the breaches arising between Decree 662 and *caducidad*.\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraphs 257-259.\n\n*AIG Capital Partners, Inc. and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/6, Award, 7 October 2003, paragraph 12.1.9: \"The burden of establishing by reliable evidence the quantum of damages or compensation for the expropriation was and is on the Claimants.\" See also CA-439, *Gemplus v. Mexico*, Award, paragraphs 13-80: \"It is for the Claimants, as claimants alleging an entitlement to such compensation, to establish the amount of that compensation: the *principle actori incumbit probatio* is '*the broad basic rule to the allocation of the burden of proof in international procedure* '.\"\n\nBrattle ER II, paragraphs 43 and 254; Cl. Rep. Q., paragraphs 257-269 commenting thereon.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of Brattle's Rebuttal Report (Brattle ER III), where it was stated at f 83: \"Professor Kalt's approach to *ex-ante* assessment also is incorrect if we were to accept the alternative - that it were possible to quantify separate damages flowing from the separate breaches in paragraph 606. This view would prompt only the introduction of an additional layer in the damages analysis to reflect the separate FET breach (which we deem quantifiable) at the associated date of breach. Perhaps this would be the moment when 'taken collectively', the measures identified in paragraph 606 of the Liability Decision amounted to a separate breach of the FET standard. Because the Liability Decision did not identify any such date, in particular in the dispositive section, we have not undertaken such an analysis. The addition of a third layer is unlikely to have a material impact on the damages to Perenco. We stand ready to introduce a third layer in the analysis if requested by the Tribunal to do so.\"\n\n87.\n\nAs for certain other criticisms of Brattle's 'layering' approach, such as Perenco's observation that Brattle's avowed *ex ante* approach to valuing the impact of Decree 662 on Perenco was not adhered to when Brattle used *ex post* information to make its 'true-up' argument, these are addressed below.\n\n88.\n\nFor its part, Ecuador maintained that the dispute between the Parties evolved over time. Therefore, it argued that its experts were right to estimate the effects of separate breaches occurring at different times in order to avoid double counting. Brattle estimated the impact of Decree 662 as of 4 October 2007, then estimated the impact of *caducidad* on the already diminished (but also already compensated) value of Perenco's interests in the Blocks.\n\n89.\n\nEcuador observed in this respect that Brattle's valuation as of the date of Decree 662 accorded with Perenco's contemporaneous calculations performed in October 2007, just days after Decree 662 was promulgated. With regard to Law 42 at 50%, Perenco calculated that the NPV for its interests in the two Blocks through to their date of expiry amounted to US$239.4 million42; Brattle's initial NPV calculation of the interests was US$265.7 million43 but this was later adjusted upwards in its Reply Report to either US$282.2 million (using RPS' capital costs) or US$295.8 million (using Professor Kalt's costs). With regard to Decree 662, Perenco's contemporaneous NPV calculation for its interests in the two Blocks was US$154.6 million44; Brattle's initial values were US$107.7 million45 and this was later updated by Brattle to come to US$127.6 million (using RPS's costs) or US$127.5 million (using Professor Kalt's costs).\n\nUS$122 million for Block 7 and $117 million for Block 21.

Brattle Table M.\n\n90.\n\nIn disputing Ecuador's attempt to use an earlier date in assessing damages, Perenco argued that 'layering' was conceptually flawed in this case because Ecuador's breaches were inter-related. Such inter-related breaches led to layering being rejected in *SAUR*.46 Here, each of Ecuador's breaches was inextricably linked to the others (and it was irrelevant, in Perenco's view, that the Tribunal did not find a creeping expropriation).47 The principle of full reparation warranted the use of a single valuation date in order to capture the cumulative effect of the breaches and thereby grant Perenco proper restitution. Brattle's approach was inconsistent with the principle that a breaching State could not be given credit for actions that depressed the value of the investment prior to expropriation (as recognised in *Occidental II*).48\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 264.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 265.\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 20.\n\n91.\n\nPerenco argued further that Brattle admitted that they applied 'layering' in a way that reduced Perenco's damages at every turn. Professor Dow conceded that if 'layering' were done in a different order, Perenco's damages would be higher.49 Perenco contended that Professor Dow and Mr. Caldwell also admitted on cross-examination that they had essentially transferred only the \"good\" risk and imposed on Perenco the \"bad\" risk: they had ignored actual high oil prices after Decree 662 in estimating Perenco's anticipated revenues, but reduced Perenco's damages by offsetting the actual Decree 662 payments based on those higher oil prices, and then deprived Perenco of the *coactiva* -seized oil's actual market price.50 Brattle's approach also presumed that in setting an *ex ante* price, a willing buyer would have foreseen the whole sequence of later events \u2014including, ultimately, oil seizure\u2014 yet Mr. Caldwell admitted that \"nobody standing in October '07 would have predicted all the set of the chain of events that would actually occur.\"51\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 21.\n\nTr.

(5) 1552:11-13 (Caldwell).\n\n92.\n\nPerenco added that Brattle's various '*stabilisation*' scenarios made no sense. Professor Dow and Mr. Caldwell admitted that their lump-sum '*side payment*' for Decree 662 amounted to continuing to apply Decree 662 to Perenco, even though the purpose of damages was to wipe out the effects of Decree 662.52 It could not be assumed that Perenco would have ceded all of its future upside for a single payment in October 2007. In addition, the notion that Perenco's expectations were immutable as of October 2007 was inconsistent with the fact that Perenco continued to operate in Ecuador after Decree 662.\n\nTr. Q.

Brattle's '*stabilisation*' scenarios were built on variations of what Ecuador contended were the parties' assumed pre-contractual expectations of the economy of the Contracts, but Mr. Caldwell could not even articulate the rationale for using such expectations to determine the damages to which Perenco was entitled under the Treaty.53\n\nTr. Q. (5) 1590:8-1591:7 (Caldwell) (stating it was a matter of instruction).\n\n94.\n\nEcuador responded to Perenco's contentions as follows.\n\n95.\n\nFirst, at the Quantum Hearing, Ecuador presented the Waterfall Chart showing the different components of damages claimed by Perenco and illustrating the impact of correcting each component.54 Perenco did not challenge the figures in the Waterfall Chart.55\n\nBrattle ER III, Figure 16.\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraph 138.\n\n96.\n\nSecond, in response to Perenco's criticism that 'layering' was invalid because of the inter-related nature of Ecuador's breaches, Perenco did not explain why the breaches were inter-related and why interrelation would matter at all to 'layering'.56 Professor Kalt acknowledged for the first time at the Quantum Hearing that he himself had done a monthly layering in his *ex ante* analysis, which stood in contradiction to his and Perenco's criticism on 'layering'.57 Professor Kalt's '*mark-to-market*' contingent contract justification for his *ex ante* calculation was entirely new at the Quantum Hearing and entirely different from the logic advanced in his Fourth Expert Report.58\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 101(i).\n\nTr. Q. (5) 1478:12-1479:13 (Kalt).\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 101(i) *c.f.* Cl. PHB Q., paragraph 18 and Kalt ER IV, paragraphs 47-52.\n\n97.\n\nIn respect of Perenco's criticism that neither Ecuador nor Brattle addressed the fact that the Tribunal found other breaches apart from Decree 662 and *caducidad*, Ecuador asserted that Brattle's 16 October 2015 Expert Report (at paragraphs 88 to 90) addressed this at length and it was Perenco who chose not to cross-examine Brattle's experts on this point during the Quantum Hearing.59\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 101(ii).\n\n98.\n\nIn respect of *SAUR* 's rejection of 'layering', Ecuador explained that that tribunal rejected 'layering' because in that case the first-in-time breach had already deprived the investment of all value, which was not the case here.60 In *Occidental II*, the two breaches found by that tribunal were only weeks apart and hence the issue was not even discussed*.*61 In contrast, in the present case the two principal breaches occurred in 2007 and 2010.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 101(iii).\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 101(iv).\n\n99.\n\nFinally, in respect of Perenco's claim that Brattle had admitted that they applied 'layering' in a way that reduced Perenco's damages at every turn, Ecuador argued that this illustrated Perenco's confusion of rather simple economics. Perenco's sole criticism was directed at Brattle's calculation of the 'true-up', which was *ex post* (*i.e.,* considering actual prices) while calculating damages to Perenco *ex ante*. As Brattle explained, \"the true up adopts an *ex-post* perspective inherently, since it must look back and assess what Law 42 amounts were actually paid by the Consortium and which levies remain outstanding.\"62 There was nothing unsound in this calculation and Professor Kalt never took issue with it. Brattle further explained that imposing on Perenco the change in oil prices when it chose to withhold taxes was appropriate, while also acknowledging that the allocation of risks was ultimately an issue for the Tribunal (hence the sensitivity calculations of the 'true-up').\n\nBrattle ER II (4 May 2015; errata 2 June 2015), paragraph 53.\n\n100.\n\nAs noted above in paragraph 77, the Tribunal has decided that it is appropriate to seek to value the damages caused by different breaches occurring at different times. To the extent that the Tribunal accepts that there were any deficiencies in the way in which Brattle performed the exercise, these can be remedied in the damages calculation.\n\n101.\n\nHaving concluded thus, the Tribunal would also note at this point that Perenco had also contended, in tandem with its single valuation date approach, that an *ex post* approach should be taken where there is an unlawful expropriation and the value of the investment had increased.63 Ecuador disagreed. In light of the Tribunal's analysis above, and its layering / \"clean sheet\" approach (discussed below), the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to delve into the arguments on this point.\n\nSee Cl. PHB Q., paragraph 7, citing CA-1, *ADC Affiliate Limited v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of the Tribunal, 27 September 2006, paragraphs 496-497; CA-438, *Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia*, ICSID Case Nos.

Has Perenco demonstrated any loss or damage proximately caused by the post-Decree 662 fair and equitable treatment breaches?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nAs noted in paragraphs 74 and 85 above, the Tribunal will award damages for any quantifiable financial losses proximately caused by the breaches determined by it in the merits phase. Damages will be awarded for Decree 662 and the declaration of *caducidad*. This raises the question whether the other breaches of fair and equitable treatment suffered by Perenco after Decree 662 but before the expropriation have been shown to result in cognisable harm.\n\n103.\n\nTo reiterate, these breaches are: \"(i) demanding that the contractors agree to surrender their rights under their participation contracts and migrate to what for a considerable period of time was an unspecified model, such that the contractors were unable to discern precisely what they were being asked to move to; (ii) escalating negotiating demands, in particular in April 2008 when the President unexpectedly suspended the negotiations and rejected what had recently been achieved in a Partial Agreement in respect of one of the blocks; (iii) making coercive and threatening statements, including threats of expulsion from Ecuador; and (iv) taking steps to enforce Law 42 against Perenco (and Burlington) for non-payment of dues claimed to be owing, a portion of which has been held to be in breach of Article 4, and when no payments were made, forcibly seizing and selling the oil produced in Blocks 7 and 21 in order to realise the claimed Law 42 debt.\"64\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 606.\n\n104.\n\nHowever, with the exception of the sales of oil seized and sold pursuant to the *coactivas*, which must be adjusted in the 'true-up' exercise to be consistent with the Tribunal's finding on Decree 662, it appears that neither Party's experts undertook the exercise of quantifying damages attributable to those breaches during the pleadings phase. Therefore, it might be that these are breaches for which proximate damage has not been estimated and therefore no damages can be awarded.65 This is the position taken by Brattle.66\n\nPerenco criticised Brattle's layering approach for estimating the impact of Decree 662 and *caducidad* only. The Tribunal's understanding is that Professor Kalt also criticised layering but did not offer any quantification of the damages for these breaches if and when they occurred.\n\nBrattle ER III, paragraph 90\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that Professor Kalt's view was that breaches (i) and (iii) listed above \"would be expected to adversely affect Perenco's investment and production decisions.\"67 The Tribunal agrees, but it also considers that this already occurred when Decree 662 took effect and Perenco stopped drilling in both Blocks (except for Oso 23). Since the Tribunal has found that wells would have been drilled in both Blocks after Decree 662 and Perenco will be compensated for the cash flows associated with those 'but for' wells as well as for the loss of the opportunity to negotiate the extension of Block 7 (see Sections II.D.3 and II.F below), in the Tribunal's view, Professor Kalt's concerns on these particular points are met.\n\nKalt ER IV, paragraph 49.\n\n106.\n\nAs for the *coactivas* issue, the Tribunal will reflect in the Award a sum of damages flowing from Perenco's being credited for the depressed auction price received for the seized oil rather than the market value. The Parties spent considerable time over the course of this proceeding addressing the impact of the *coactivas*. There is record evidence on the amounts of oil seized, the prices at which it was sold and the amounts that were credited to Perenco. However, the analysis is complicated by the fact that after submitting its claim to arbitration, Perenco (and Burlington) stopped paying Law 42 dues and instead began to deposit them in an account located outside of Ecuador. Given that Perenco failed in its attempt to prove a breach of contract and Treaty for Law 42 at 50%, the Tribunal considers that there is some merit to Ecuador's 'true-up' claim. It follows that some accounting for Perenco's non-compliance with Law 42 must be performed. In the Tribunal's view, this issue is best addressed as part of its discussion of Ecuador's 'true-up' claim below.\n\n107.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that the financial impact of the non-Decree 662 breaches has either been accounted for in the 'but for' analysis of Decree 662 as of 4 October 2007 or was not quantified by the expert reports submitted with the Claimant's pleadings on quantum.\n\n**3. Use of a 'clean sheet' for the valuation of the expropriation damages**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal has accepted Ecuador's submission that the use of a single date for valuing the damages is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case. The Tribunal recalls that Brattle defended its 'layering' approach based on the need to safeguard against double-counting:\n\n\"We then estimated the FMV of Perenco's interests in July 2010, when Ecuador declared Caducidad. The Tribunal deemed Caducidad to amount to expropriation. Our estimate of the July 2010 FMV of Perenco's interests netted off the impact of Decree 662, reflecting our separate quantification of the damages due in relation to it in the first step. Netting off the impact of Decree 662 was necessary to avoid double-counting.\"68\n\nBrattle ER III, paragraph 67(b).\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that double-counting must be avoided, but it has arrived at a different solution from that proposed by Brattle.\n\n110.\n\nThis results from the Tribunal's seeing merit in Perenco's concern that estimating the damages as of the first completed breach could be unfair to it. Depending upon how the compensation for the first completed breach is calculated, it is possible, as Professor Kalt contended, that factoring in the effects of Decree 662 could have a price-depressing impact on Perenco's rights that ended up being expropriated.\n\n111.\n\nHaving carefully reflected on the Parties' submissions, the Tribunal has concluded that the fairest approach to take in the circumstances of the present case is the following: Since at the time of the first breach it was by no means certain that an expropriation would follow Decree 662 some 33 months later, the Tribunal will calculate the damages proximately caused by Decree 662 for the period 4 October 2007 to 20 July 2010. This is on the basis that Decree 662 was the only compensable breach for that period of time.\n\n112.\n\nIn principle, the Tribunal would have also awarded any damages proximately caused by the subsequent fair and equitable treatment breaches, but it has already found that the Claimant did not adduce evidence of the financial impact of the post-Decree 662 fair and equitable treatment breaches. Therefore, no damages can be awarded for those breaches. But since Perenco's rights were brought to an end by the act of *caducidad*, the Tribunal will re-estimate the loss of those rights according to then-prevailing market conditions and industry expectations (as well as in light of the hypothetical increased production in the two Blocks in the 'but for' scenario).\n\n113.\n\nHaving arrived at this approach, the Tribunal's initial thinking was that this would be done based on the ratio between the total number of months between October 2007 and July 2010 and the total number of months from October 2010 until contract expiry. However, a simple temporal pro-rating would lead to a biased result that could assign a lower value to cash flows that would have been generated during the October 2007 to July 2010 period than should be the case.69 In the circumstances, therefore, the Tribunal has added up the discounted cash flows in the October 2007 damages model through to July 2010. This ensures that the value for the October 2007 layer of damages reflects the actual discounting and contribution of pre-July 2010 cash flows to the October 2007 fair market value and also accounts for the full cost of any pre-July 2010 CAPEX.\n\nThis is due to the fact that a pro-rating approach would implicitly assume that the value produced by the field was constant in each month over the field's life. Discounting would over-weight cash flows that are nearer in time relative to those further off in the future. In addition, value is often front-end loaded because production rates often start high and then decline over time. Declining profiles result in higher revenue and cash flows earlier in field life than later. Pro-rating would also cause problems with the modeling of capital expenditures.\n\n114.\n\nThe result is an initial award of damages for Decree 662's impact during the roughly 33-month period between the first completed breach and the last breach. Then, because of the effect of the expropriation, a new valuation is performed, based on pricing and market information available as of the date of the expropriation. The initial award of damages attributable to Decree 662 is capped at that point; this then requires the Tribunal to make certain determinations as to the nature of the contractual rights that were terminated. These are included in the calculation and the value of the one-month interest in Block 7 as well as the approximately 10-year period left on Block 21 will be estimated.\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken this approach because it accepts Professor Kalt's concern about valuing an asset whose value had already been diminished. Thus, rather than valuing what might be called the 'below reference price' contractual rights, in theory compensated by the prior award of damages, as of the day before the expropriation, the Tribunal will establish a new valuation of the totality of the contractual rights that were taken away from Perenco, based on the prevailing market conditions. This analysis will be *ex ante*, but it will allow the Tribunal to consider all relevant actual market developments as well as employ the assumptions as to what Perenco would have done in both Blocks during the prior period and what it would have done in the remainder of the Blocks' lives.\n\n116.\n\nUnlike the situation in *ADC v. Hungary*, where the value of the airport concession rights at issue had crystallised after the submission of the claim to arbitration and before the date of the award70, the Tribunal finds itself in the midst of a period stretching between *caducidad* and the date of expiry. Having regard to the Parties' extensive debate over the use of *ex ante* versus *ex post* valuation data, the Tribunal is concerned about the degree of randomness associated with employing the date of the Award as the valuation date since a single significant event can have dramatic effects on valuation given the volatility of the oil market. In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal will employ an *ex ante* willing buyer-willing seller approach using the price of oil prevailing at the time of the expropriation (approximately US$76/bbl WTI as of July 2010).\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006.\n\n117.\n\nIn line with its conclusions that:\n\n(i) there were no inter-linked breaches such as to justify the use of a single date of valuation;71\n\n(ii) it is in principle appropriate to seek to value the damages caused by the different breaches occurring at the relevant times; and\n\n(iii) the contemporaneous evidence of value is a useful check against the Tribunal's estimates;\n\nthe Tribunal considers that an approach using the well-accepted *ex ante* approach to valuation as the primary point of reference is reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. (It uses the word \"*primary*\" because of the fact that with the passage of time between the commencement of this arbitration and the rendering of this Award, Petroamazonas has operated the Blocks and inevitably the testimonial and expert evidence pertaining to the operation of Block 21, in particular, has mixed *ex ante* with *ex post* data. In the circumstances, the Tribunal has no interest in attempting to 'unscramble the egg' by drawing a strict line between these data.)\n\nSee above, Section II.C.1) Date of Valuation.\n\n**4. The Role of Contemporaneous Evidence of Value**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal is strengthened in its belief that estimating the damages attributable to each breach and in chronological order is the correct approach to be taken in the circumstances of this case, by the availability of Perenco's contemporaneous net present value (NPV) calculations of the impact of Law 42 at both 50% and 99% on both Blocks. These calculations were performed immediately after Decree 662's announcement.72 The spreadsheet for Block 21, for example, which was disclosed by Perenco in the documents production phase and reviewed by Brattle, shows that the NPV calculation for Block 21 ran, as would be expected, to Block 21 Contract's expiry date of 2021.73\n\nExhibit BR-26.\n\nExhibit BR-27 (NPV impact of Law 42 at 99%); Exhibit BR-28 (NPV impact of Law 42 at 50%).\n\n119.\n\nThese documents of the Claimant's own making are, in the Tribunal's view, good evidence of the Blocks' estimated value with Law 42 at 50% and 99% in light of the existing and expected market circumstances at the time of the first breach. Brattle studied Perenco's calculations and adjusted them; Perenco had, for example, used July 2007 WTI prices rather than the higher prices prevailing in early October 2007. In fact, Brattle ended up arriving at somewhat higher NPV calculations than Perenco itself did at the time.74\n\nSee Brattle ER II, paragraph 253: \"Damages for this economy of the contract scenario resemble the financial analysis performed by Perenco, in October 2007 immediately after the introduction of Decree 662. We estimate that Decree 662 reduced the October 2007 fair market value of Perenco's Block 7 and 21 interests by $158 million (excl. prejudgment interest), just less than double the $85 million estimated by Perenco at the time.\" This is further elaborated in footnote 157 to the same paragraph: \"Perenco's estimate of $84.8 million appears in an 9 October 2007 email from Jerome Garcia. With Law 42 at 50%, we estimate the October 2007 fair market value at $109.1 million for Block 7 and $156.6 million for Block 21. This compares with the $122.1 million for Block 7 and $117.3 million for Block 21 reported in the Jerome Garcia email. At Block 21 (where we have the Perenco models), we assume higher prices and costs than Perenco's models (PERPROD0032725 (Exhibit BR-27) and PERPROD0032726 (Exhibit BR-28)), and more production. With Decree 662, we estimate the October 2007 fair market value at $58.8 million for Block 7 and $48.9 million at Block 21. This compares to the $84.1 million for Block 7 and the $70.5 million for Block 21 estimated by Perenco at the time. Given the presence of Decree 662, our fair market value estimate for Block 21 is lower than Perenco's because our model assumes higher operating costs.\"\n\n120.\n\nIn its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, Perenco downplayed the significance of its NPV calculations, describing them as \"*back-of-the-envelope, hurried calculations to understand Decree 662's immediate impact.*\"75\n\nCl. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 73.\n\n121.\n\nEcuador had addressed this contention in its closing submissions at the Quantum Closing. Slides 122 and 123 of Ecuador's presentation showed that the calculations were closely comparable to Perenco's other valuations, made prior to Decree 662's coming into effect, as to the Blocks' value and indeed in one case what Perenco \u2013 *acting as a possible willing purchaser* \u2013 might be willing to pay Burlington for the latter's interests in the Blocks just one month before Decree 662's promulgation.76 In counsel's submission:\n\n\"This confirms that the allegedly hurried calculation of BR-26 is not such hurried valuation. It actually follows from a September 2007 valuation, that's consistent, and then it's much higher than the March 2007 valuation. These were prepared with plenty of time, not in a hurry. And as you can see at the bottom of the table, we have put Brattle's valuation. Brattle's valuation of Block 7, 111.3 million, is within 10 percent of Perenco's own valuations in October and September 2007 and higher than their earlier valuation of March 2007.  \nThe same happens with Block 21.\"77\n\nTr. Q. (2) 366:18\u2013367:5 (Cross-examination of Combe): \"This is a valuation document for purchase. So, I would expect a \u2014and I have to say, I did not participate in it\u2014 so, that's my opinion might be slightly different from what Paddy [Spink] did here \u2014Paddy was our manager for new business\u2014 but basically he was being conservative in evaluating prices so he would assume probably the low case. So, if Conoco was not putting any value on the extension, then he wouldn't offer any additional value. That's standard practice, basically.\"\n\nTr. Q. (6) 1833:9-20 (Respondent's Closing Submission).\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Perenco's analysts would have had a good preliminary understanding of Decree 662's impact on the company's interests in the Blocks. The email chain's distribution list contains the names of seven Perenco employees who were involved in analysing Decree 662, including Eric d'Argentr\u00e9, Perenco's Country Manager for Ecuador. Obviously, the calculations were based on the information available to the company at the time. This necessarily has to be the case when projecting into the future with a new factor added into the mix. But the projections were being made by employees with knowledge of (i) the Participation Contracts' terms; (ii) the Blocks' performance to date and their characteristics and potential; (iii) Perenco's and the Consortium's intentions; and (iv) wider industry market expectations at the time.\n\n123.\n\nDuring 2007, in the months leading up to Decree 662, Perenco: (i) produced its Mid-Term Outlook in March; (ii) valued Burlington's interests in the Blocks with a view to a potential purchase in September; and (iii) analysed the effect of Decree 662 in October 2007.78 The Tribunal notes that Professor Kalt commented in his December 2014 expert report that in his experience, \"*investors in oil and gas properties and contracts routinely use DCF analysis in the course of business to provide them with measures of how much they should value an investment and, in certain cases, how much they should be willing to pay, or be paid, for oil and gas development projects*.\"79 The Tribunal accepts this and is therefore inclined to use Perenco's contemporaneous analysis of the impact of Decree 662 as a check on its own estimation of the Blocks' values.\n\nExhibit BR-27 and Exhibit BR-28, Spreadsheet analyses for Block 21, which were also attached to Exhibit BR-26, PERPROD0032722 (emails exchanged internally regarding impact of Law 42 at 99%).\n\nKalt ER III, paragraph 54.\n\n124.\n\nProfessor Kalt initially testified that he recalled having seen Perenco's internal calculations of Law 42's effect at 50% and 99% on its interests in the Blocks but then indicated that he was not sure whether he had seen Perenco's spreadsheets. In any event, he stated that he did not find it relevant to discuss them in his reports.80 This was an understandable position for him to take because it was consistent with his view that the single date approach to valuation should be taken. Since the Tribunal has *not* taken the 'single date' approach, however, it considers Perenco's NPV calculations to be relevant evidence of its view of the Blocks' values in October 2007 with and without Law 42 at 99%. Obviously, that value would change over time depending upon a host of factors, but it is a good way to check the results that the Tribunal arrives at.\n\nTr. Q. (5) 1333:5-16, 1334:1-4 (Kalt). \"Q. Do you understand this e-mail to reflect what Perenco thought at the time would be what would happen in all probability had it continued with the Contracts? A. Well, I don't know. They've obviously done some kind of analysis of that nature. But I can't tell all the assumptions that they are putting in here. They're doing some calculation of that. They're trying to understand something about the impact of Decree 662 on them obviously, but I don't know all the assumptions that go into this. I don't know.\u2026Q. \u2026but did you ever see a copy of those spreadsheets? A. I don't know. I don't recall.\"\n\n**5. Summary of the Tribunal's General Approach**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe point of departure therefore is the Tribunal's view that it must estimate the damages proximately caused by each breach and that this must be done as of the date of their occurrence. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers primarily on an *ex ante* basis (and referring to contemporaneous evidence where possible):\n\n(i) the financial impact of Decree 662 on Perenco's interests in the Blocks as of the date of the first completed breach, 4 October 2007, with a view to estimating the compensation for the damage caused by that breach;\n\n(ii) and in relation to the foregoing, Decree 662's specific impact on Perenco's drilling plans at the time so as to estimate what they would have been through to contract expiry for both Blocks in the 'but for' world (because this issue drives the expected levels of production and hence the projections of cash flows in the 'but for' world);\n\n(iii) the damages to which Perenco is entitled as a result of the termination of its contractual rights in relation to Blocks 7 and 21;\n\n(iv) whether, in the 'but for' world, Perenco would have enjoyed an extension of its operatorship in Block 7 after August 2010;\n\n(v) Ecuador's 'true-up' submissions to determine whether any damages calculated under the foregoing heads need to be adjusted; and\n\n(vi) the applicable rates of interest (to the date of the Award and to the date of payment of the Award).\n\n126.\n\nBased on its various findings and conclusions, the Tribunal will then estimate the quantum of damages that should be awarded to Perenco using a 'harmonised model' that draws from the work of both sides' financial experts.\n\nD. **The Quantum of Damages for Decree 662, the First Completed Breach**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Tribunal did not find a breach of contract or of treaty for Law 42 at 50% and therefore no damages can flow for Law 42 dues at 50%, at least until the promulgation of Decree 662, for the simple fact that no unlawful act was committed until 4 October 2007.81 The question is whether or how the analysis changes as of that date. This affects the analysis on the drilling programme and in turn the volume of oil produced in the 'but for' scenario.\n\nAs the ILC Articles state in Article 31(2), Reparation: \"Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, *caused by the internationally wrongful act* of a State.\" Commentary (9) notes in this regard that it is \"*only* '[i]njury \u2026 caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State' for which full reparation must be made.\" [Emphasis added.]\n\n**1. Economy of the contracts \u2013 Whether Law 42 would have been completely absorbed**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Perenco's Position*\n------------------------\n\n128.\n\nPerenco argued that the economy of the Contracts was the specific contractual bargain reflected in the economic clauses of the Contracts themselves, which guaranteed Perenco's full exposure to oil prices regardless of IRR.82 Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose and Professor Aguilar both agreed that, under Ecuadorian law, the '*economy*' of a contract designates the balance of rights and obligations that determined the economic benefits of the contract for the parties.83 This also defined the risks that each party would bear during the performance of the contract.84\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 58.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 59.\n\n*Id.*\n\n129.\n\nThe evidence confirmed that Law 42 triggered the clauses. Perenco would have exercised its '*absorption*' rights in a 'but for' world. The Tribunal must assume that Ecuador would have honoured its legal obligations in good faith.\n\n130.\n\nPerenco argued that it had not lost its '*absorption*' rights whether on grounds of *res judicata* or waiver. First, the Tribunal has not expressly decided the issue and has not rejected it. The Tribunal found only that Perenco had not established that Ecuador breached Perenco's '*absorption*' rights before Decree 662. Ecuador's argument, that the Tribunal's decision to reject Perenco's claim that it was futile to exercise its rights when Law 42 applied at 50% should be applied *mutatis mutandis* to the situation where Law 42 applied at 99%, is incorrect because the Tribunal held that pursuing the clauses was indeed futile after Decree 662.\n\n131.\n\nSecond, Perenco had not waived those rights. Perenco had paid the Law 42 dues on a '*bajo protesta*' ('*without prejudice* ') basis. It had invoked the Renegotiation Clauses through its December 2006 letters. Perenco also claimed a breach of the clauses in this arbitration. Even if Perenco's attempts to invoke the clauses were not exercised sufficiently vigorously in relation to Law 42 at 50%, this did not amount to a waiver of its rights under Ecuadorian law. Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose's testimony that nothing obliged Perenco to exercise the rights within a particular time was unchallenged.85 The evidence and testimony of Perenco's witnesses also confirmed that Perenco continued to seek discussions with Ecuador through various avenues. Seeking an abatement of Law 42 was one of the key objectives that Perenco's CEO set for the Ecuador team in 2007.86 Mr. Combe and Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9 both testified that they did intend to further assert Perenco's absorption rights, but were attempting to find the right opportunity to do so.87 This was confirmed by Mr. M\u00e1rquez.88\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 108, citing Tr. Q.

The Tribunal had already rejected Ecuador's contention that the Renegotiation Clauses mandated only that the Parties negotiate a mutually agreeable offset.89 The Tribunal found that the absorption clauses \"did stipulate the ultimate result, namely, a change in the parties' respective participations 'which absorbs the increase or decrease in the tax burden.'\"90 Ecuador conflated the clauses' mandated result (full absorption) and the precise means to reach that result (good-faith negotiations). The December 2006 letters confirm Perenco's contemporaneous understanding of the absorption clauses, for example: \"the Consortium will present the numbers which illustrate [the] economic impact on the Contract[s], in order to determine the percentage of participation which should be adjusted in favor of the Contractor.\"91\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 152 *responding to* Resp. C-Mem. Q., paragraph 190; see also *ibid.* paragraph 161, 201.\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 365.\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 156 quoting Decision on Liability, paragraph 379; referring further to Combe WS II, paragraph 18.\n\n133.\n\nEcuador's alternative partial absorption theory was not what the Contracts provide. They required that the correction absorb the increase or decrease in the tax burden, not only an increment of the new tax.\n\n*(b) Ecuador's Position*\n------------------------\n\n134.\n\nEcuador stated that its position throughout this arbitration has been that since the economy of the contract was never disturbed, the invocation of the Participation Contracts' taxation modification clauses would not have led to an adjustment of Perenco's participation, and therefore no damages are due.92 Ecuador argued that the economy of the contract was a mathematical-economic equation underlying Clauses 8.1 of the Participation Contracts which was either the Consortium's expected average revenue of US$15/bbl or the Consortium's expected internal rate of return of around 15%.93 Perenco's claim to full absorption found no support in the Participation Contracts themselves (noting in this regard that the Tribunal had found that the Renegotiation Clauses \"did not stipulate how the correction factor was to be calculated\").94 Further, Perenco's reliance on Ecuador's alleged past practice in relation to VAT, SOTE and ECORAE charges is entirely misplaced.\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraphs 78-79.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 141.\n\nResp. C-Mem. Q., paragraph 141, citing Decision on Liability, paragraph 365.\n\n135.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to consider that modification was necessary so that the Consortium might enjoy some form of unspecified 'upside' potential on oil prices, such modification would not simply be to absorb the difference between Law 42 at 50% and 99% but only to absorb such amount necessary to provide the Consortium with the 'upside' exposure to oil prices to which the Tribunal appeared to consider that the Consortium was entitled. As Brattle explained, on this theory, Law 42 would apply to the Consortium at a rate of 81% for Block 21 and 99% for Block 7, but even at those rates, no modification of the X factors was necessary.95\n\nResp. C-Mem. Q., paragraph 142.\n\n136.\n\nIt argued further that since the Tribunal found that once Law 42 at 50% was implemented, \"it was incumbent upon [Perenco] to make its case \u2026 at that time\"96 and since Perenco did not do so, it was too late to do so in the quantum phase by arguing it would have invoked its rights \"but for\" Decree 662.97 Ecuador considered that Perenco was relying on self-serving evidence, \"non-credible *ex post facto* testimonies\" such as Mr. M\u00e1rquez's statement that Perenco was simply waiting for the right opportunity to discuss the matter properly.98 The simple truth was that, whether it believed the process was futile or not, Perenco had determined not to seek the application of the Renegotiation Clauses with respect to Law 42 at 50%.99\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 394.\n\nResp. PHB Q, paragraph 58.\n\nResp. Rej. Q., paragraph 257.\n\nResp. C-Mem. Q., paragraph 148.\n\n137.\n\nEcuador argued therefore that Perenco could not now seek to invoke the Renegotiation Clauses in the quantum phase to claim full absorption of Law 42.\n\n*(c) The Tribunal's Decision*\n-----------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe issue is whether the damages to be awarded in respect of Decree 662 should be calculated (i) for the entirety of the 99% of the extraordinary revenues set by the Decree; (ii) for the additional 49% (*i.e.* above Law 42 at 50%) of the above-reference price value required to be collected by Decree 662; or (iii) on some other basis.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by recalling that its Decision on Liability contains a finding that bears on this issue. At paragraph 703, it stated:\n\n\"In the end, the narrow question for the Tribunal is whether Perenco, having sought the aid of the Tribunal, could then take comfort that its refusal to pay the 2008 Law 42 dues to Ecuador would protect it in this arbitration without any potentially adverse consequences. The Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties' positions. It considers that Perenco had a right to expect that Ecuador would desist from enforcing the *coactivas* during the pendency of the arbitration. It also considers that in deciding to withhold all Law 42 amounts claimed in 2008, Perenco assumed that the Tribunal would accept its claims that none of the Law 42 dues claimed by the State were permissible under the Contracts or the Treaty. Given that Perenco has not made out its claims in respect of Law 42 at 50%, the Tribunal holds that even though Ecuador should have complied with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the *coactivas* ought not to be included in the Tribunal's analysis of the measures said collectively to constitute an indirect expropriation\u2026 In addition, to the extent that Perenco has succeeded in its claim that the application of Decree 662 at 99% violated Article 4 of the Treaty, as found at paragraphs 606-607 above, the enforcement of the *coactivas* to collect the claimed additional 49% constituted a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, but it was not an expropriation of the investment.)\"100 [Emphasis added.]\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 703.\n\n140.\n\nThe precise wording of this finding precludes awarding damages for Law 42's effect prior to the first breach. But the Tribunal also found that futility was proven as of 4 October 2007.101 Beyond that, the Tribunal did not pass on what might be considered in the damages phase with respect to the possible exercise of the tax modification clauses (except to note how the contracts' provisions were expected to operate).102\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 411.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 395-398.\n\n141.\n\nFor the purposes of its damages analysis, the Tribunal considers that it must be assumed that if Perenco exercised its contractual rights in the 'but for' scenario, Ecuador would have responded in good faith by negotiating an absorption of the additional tax burden effected by Decree 662. After considering the evidence, the Tribunal finds that in the 'but for' scenario for the period after Decree 662 came into effect, Perenco would have sought an offset. But having regard to the evidence as whole, the Tribunal is not convinced that Perenco would have sought the complete elimination of Law 42 (*i.e*. stabilisation at 0%). Rather, it would have sought to undo the effect of Decree 662 and, to the extent reasonably possible, Law 42.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal's reasoning in this respect is straightforward: (i) it was clear to all that Ecuador was moving away from participation contracts and could be expected to require that any new contracts that it might grant would not follow that model; (ii) even in the 'but for' world, this change in the country's hydrocarbons exploitation policy would exist as a lawful fact; (iii) the Block 7 Participation Contract was approaching its expiry (in August 2010) and Perenco was well aware of that fact and the need to adjust its expectations in order to have any chance of obtaining an extension of its operatorship in Block 7; and (iv) it is common ground between the Parties and was well understood at the time that Block 7 was the more valuable of the two Blocks.\n\n143.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal believes that Perenco would have recognised that the extraordinary returns generated under the Participation Contracts due to the significant increase in oil prices starting in the early 2000s were, for Ecuador, practically-speaking unsustainable, having regard to the financial implications of the windfalls that had been generated from the country's finite hydrocarbon resources under this form of contract. Moreover, Perenco's interest in obtaining a contractual extension for Block 7 would have provided a strong incentive for it to moderate its demands in seeking the full absorption of Law 42. In short, the Tribunal believes that in the 'but for' world, Perenco would have been most likely to seek a negotiation under the tax modification clauses that would have reduced the State's take of the extraordinary revenues, whilst maximising the company's chances of its obtaining an extension of its operatorship of Block 7.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal thus holds that after Decree 662 entered into effect, Perenco would have been prompted to trigger negotiations and the Parties would have agreed to Law 42 being stabilised at 33% starting 5 October 2008, to be applied prospectively, for both contracts.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal adds that while it might be that in the 'but for' world Perenco would use the occasion of the tax modification negotiations simultaneously to seek a Block 7 extension, it cannot be safely assumed that Ecuador would have agreed to an extension. The extension issue is therefore addressed separately below.\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that Perenco's interests in the two Participation Contracts would be adjusted to a stabilised Law 42 rate of 33% as of 5 October 2008 through to contract expiry.\n\n**2. Estimating the Direct Financial Impact of Law 42 at 99%**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nIn terms of valuing the direct financial impact of Decree 662, Perenco's NPV calculation performed just after Decree 662 was promulgated permitted the Tribunal to perform a rough estimate of the value of the company's interests in the Blocks by subtracting the total value of the revenues foregone in the remaining years of the Contracts in order to arrive at an estimate of the residual value of Perenco's interests (what might be termed the \"below Decree 662 reference price\" value). This was also valued by Brattle and the results are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Points of differences** | **Perenco in 2007** | **Brattle (1st****Report)**103 | **Brattle (2nd****Report)**104**\u2013 Updated using****RPS's Costs** | **Brattle (2nd****Report)**105**\u2013 Updated using Prof.****Kalt's Costs** |\n| Value of Block 7 with Law 42 | NPV: $122.1 million | FMV: $109.1 million | FMV: $111.3 million | FMV: $114.5 million |\n| Value of Block 21 with Law 42 | NPV: $117.3 million | FMV: $156.6 million106 | FMV: $170.9 million | FMV: $181.3 million |\n| **Total Value of Blocks with Law 42***(c.f.

Here the Parties' oilfields experts (Perenco's Mr. Crick, acting not as an independent expert, but rather as a fact witness with certain technical expertise, and RPS, Ecuador's technical experts) held very different views as to what that drilling activity would have been undertaken but for Decree 662, an issue to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\n**3. Decree 662's Impact on Perenco's Drilling Plans for Block 7 and Block 21**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe evidence is that the decree led to a virtually immediate stoppage in the Consortium's drilling operations.108 In Exhibit BR-26, the Perenco email which contained the results of the company's NPV calculations, there was some discussion about continuing with the plan to drill Oso 23.109 But this was the sole exception to the cessation of drilling activity. Charts depicting the company's well-drilling history produced at the Tribunal's request after the Quantum Hearing showed that while Perenco drilled 11 wells in Block 21 in 2005, 13 in 2006 and one in 2007, it did not drill any wells in 2008 or in the first half of 2009 (whereupon it suspended operations).110 Likewise, for Block 7, Perenco drilled six wells in 2005, 11 in 2006 and five in 2007, but it did not drill any wells in 2008 or in the first half of 2009.111\n\nCl. Mem. Q., paragraph 47; d'Argentr\u00e9 WS V, paragraph 16; Perrodo WS II, paragraph 7.\n\nExhibit BR-26: In response to Mr. Daniel Kadjar's query, \"Do you recommend to drill Oso-23 and release the rig afterwards or to release the rig after Oso-22?\", Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9 wrote in an email, \"If we drill the OSO23 we must explain to the state that this is the last one and that we do it because of contractual obligation with the drilling contractor, and that it is obviously difficult to stop a campaign so quickly. In other words, we don't want the state to believe that we carry on drilling because it is still profitable. To answer your question I think we should drill OSO23 and send our termination notification to H&P in the meantime. We have all drilling equipment ready plus the NPV is still around 3.7M$.\"\n\nBlock 21 Wells Chart for Tribunal produced on 15 December 2015 by way of email.\n\n*Id.*\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that but for Decree 662, in the absence of its securing an extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract, Perenco would have drilled more wells in Block 7 up to August 2009 (one year before the Contract's expiry, whereupon Perenco would have ceased drilling wells due to the need to ensure an adequate payback before contract expiry112). As for Block 21 (which, at the time of Decree 662's promulgation, still had some 14 years left before the Contract expired), the Tribunal has to estimate a reasonable drilling programme for that Block, which programme might reasonably be expected to extend past the declaration of *caducidad*.\n\nTr. Q. (3) 627:14-22 (Mr. Crick's Direct Presentation).\n\n152.\n\nThis exercise is also potentially bound up in the evaluation of the drilling activities after the declaration of *caducidad* in that there are two periods with which the Tribunal is concerned: (i) from 4 October 2007 to 20 July 2010; and (i) from 21 July 2010 to contract expiry. This means weighing the Consortium's actual plans up to 4 October 2007 which were then put on hold and considering what would, on a balance of probabilities, likely have happened in both blocks had Decree 662 not been promulgated. This will be used for the first period. The Tribunal will then perform a further estimate as to what would have happened after the declaration of *caducidad*.\n\n153.\n\nThis necessarily raises the question of the fate of the Block 7 Contract because Mr. Crick indicated that the Consortium would have continued drilling in Block 7 at least up to August 2009. He testified that this was when, in the absence of an extension, Perenco would stop drilling new wells due to the need to enjoy a suitable payback period before surrendering Block 7 to Ecuador.113 Accordingly, the Tribunal will first consider whether, in the 'but for' world, Perenco would have enjoyed an extension of its operatorship in Block 7 after August 2010.\n\nCrick WS II, paragraph 147: \"I have assumed that Perenco would have achieved an average of one well per month, and I assume that it would have stopped any new investments one year before the end of the contract. [August 2010 expiry date for the Block 7 Contract].\"\n\n*(a) The question of an extension of the Block 7 Contract after August 2010*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nWith good reason, the Parties have argued this issue at considerable length, since it accounted for a substantial portion of Perenco's revised claim of a total of US$1,493 billion in damages. (See Brattle's Waterfall Chart reproduced above at paragraph 65.) As already noted, Perenco's rights under the contract to the Block 7 Oso Field were the most valuable of Perenco's Ecuadorian assets.114\n\nPerenco's Chairman, Fran\u00e7ois Perrodo, likewise stated that the Block 7 Contract extension was a \"high priority\" for Perenco and that Perenco was prepared to offer significant value to obtain an extension. Perrodo WS II, paragraph 10.\n\n155.\n\nAccording to the Contract, Perenco's interest in Block 7 was to expire on 16 August 2010, and as events transpired, this occurred some 27 days after the declaration of *caducidad* was issued.115\n\n*Caducidad* was declared on 20 July 2010.\n\n156.\n\nThe Contract contained a clause that permitted the Contract to be extended in certain circumstances:\n\n\"**Clause 6.2 Production Period** : In this case, the Production Period shall last until August sixteenth (16), two thousand ten (2010); this term may be extended, provided that it is in the State's best interest, for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 When the Production area is located far from existing hydrocarbon production infrastructure, with the prior approval of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and for a period of up to five (5) years;\n\n\u2022 When the Contractor proposes significant new investments during the last five (5) years of the Production Period, with the prior agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the approval of the CEL, provided that adequate amortization periods are required for those investments;\n\n\u2022 If the Commercially Exploitable Hydrocarbon Deposits are discovered as an exclusive result of new exploration work performed by the Contractor, the Production Period shall be extended with the prior agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the approval of the CEL.\"116\n\nCE-17.\n\n*(i) Perenco's Position*\n------------------------\n\n157.\n\nPerenco argued vigorously that its contractual rights would not have expired, but rather in the 'but for' world it would have been permitted to operate the field in some form or another. In this regard, it pointed to evidence of other extensions granted by Ecuador to operators during the relevant period.117 It also noted that even during the time that it operated under Decree 662 at 99%, it was negotiating an alternative arrangement with Petroecuador \u2013 the so-called *Acta* \u2013 and that the parties had arrived at an agreement which was not consummated because Perenco's fellow consortium member, Burlington, having decided to withdraw from Ecuador, refused to agree to its terms. As the Tribunal found, this refusal of its fellow Consortium member was essentially held against Perenco by Ecuador.118\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 168 relying on Resp. C-Mem. Q, paragraph 118 which cites the amended contracts for Block 10, Block 14, Block 16, Block 17, MDC, PBHI and Tarapoa.\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 619.\n\n*[1] Ecuador did not have unfettered discretion whether or not to grant an extension*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nPerenco argued first that the evidence showed that a good faith exercise of Ecuador's discretion under Clause 6.2 would more likely than not have led to an extension of Perenco's Block 7 operatorship. Ecuador did not have unfettered discretion to refuse to extend Perenco's Block 7 operatorship. As Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose testified, a fair reading of Clause 6.2 would be that when any of the three circumstances for extension were met,119 the State's best interest was presumptively satisfied and Ecuador was obliged to grant an extension.120\n\nLoose ER VI, paragraph 38: \"Clause 6.2 established Perenco's right to have the term of the contract extended provided that certain conditions are met: (i) when the \"production area is located far from the existing petroleum hydrocarbons infrastructure...\"; (ii) when the Contractor proposes \u2022significant new investments in the last five (5) [years] of the Production Period\u2026\u00aa and \"provided adequate amortization periods are required for said investments\"; and (iii) when there is a \u2022...discovery of new Commercially Producible Hydrocarbons Deposits exclusively as the result of new exploration work done by the Contractor...'\".\n\nCl.

It was indeed discredited by Ecuador's own sweeping practice of extending the operatorships of existing contractors on amended contractual terms.121\n\nResp. C-Mem. Q, paragraph 118 which cites the amended contracts for Block 10, Block 14, Block 16, Block 17, MDC, PBHI and Tarapoa but asserting that these contracts were not extended.\n\n160.\n\nEcuador had not contested the fact that it was prepared to extend Perenco's Block 7 operatorship on different terms from the existing ones, and that it would have done so had it complied with its international and contractual obligations. Ecuador's witnesses such as Messrs. D\u00e1valos, Palacios, Pinto, and Chiriboga repeatedly acknowledged during the merits phase that they wanted Perenco to continue operating in Block 7.122 As for Perenco's witnesses, they confirmed that the extension was a high priority for the company and that they believed that they could have reached an agreement with Ecuador but for the unlawful acts. This was corroborated by contemporaneous internal documents and correspondence with Ecuador and was not tested on cross-examination.123\n\nSee Palacios WS I, paragraph 22; Palacios WS II, paragraphs 25, 33: Pinto WS I, paragraphs 22-23; Pinto WS II, paragraphs 9, 17-18; Chiriboga WS I, paragraphs 12-13; Tr. Q. (4) 936:2-17 (Chiriboga). Counsel for Perenco also submitted: \"Ecuador \u2014and this will be a theme of my presentation\u2014 was always, Members of the Tribunal, a very reasonable partner. Also in his letter of the 1st of March 2006, President Palacio has stated the following: 'On repeated occasions I have invited the oil companies that have contracts with the Ecuadorian State to initiate processes of reaching an understanding for the equitable distribution of the extraordinary earnings. Nonetheless, these invitations have not been responded to, a situation that further justifies the reforms proposed without this meaning that the renegotiation process has been closed.' Well, at the same time President Palacio was submitting the draft of what became Law 42, President Palacio was expressly saying that the negotiation could be possible, that he expected \u2014he hoped that he could actually go to the table, at the table with the oil companies and discuss the oil contracts. [\u2026]  \nAs a rapid review of the essential facts from Law 42 to the termination of the Participation Contracts through *caducidad* shows, Ecuador was always a reasonable partner. You saw that in the invitations to negotiate in 2005. You saw that in the letter of President Palacio of the 1st of March 2006. And, hence, Ecuador was always willing to negotiate, but let's go right away to the facts \u2026\" (Tr. M. (1) 275:10-22; 276:1-6; 281:4-11).\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 117 referring to CE-323, p. 6; Exhibit BR-32, Slide 36; E-387, Slide 103; CE-324.\n\n161.\n\nThe Parties' mutual interest in extending Perenco's operations in Block 7 was consistent with the longstanding historical practice in the upstream oil industry generally, and especially in Ecuador, to extend the contracts of incumbent operators. According to Mr. D\u00e1valos' testimony on redirect examination, Ecuador apparently declined to extend contracts only twice over the past three decades.124\n\nTr. Q. (3) 792:9-793:6, 830:14-832:5 (D\u00e1valos).\n\n162.\n\nIn 2010 alone, Ecuador executed seven amended oil contracts, extending the terms of six of the original contracts by between six and fifteen years.125\n\nSee http://www.hidrocarburos.gob.ec/biblioteca/ (website of the Hydrocarbons Secretariat, containing links to the amended contracts for Block 10, Block 14, Block 16, Block 17, MDC, PBHI, and Tarapoa). Cl. Mem. Q., paragraph 146.\n\n163.\n\nUltimately, Perenco was open to concluding a reasonable services contract for the extension period. Perenco argued that Ecuador did not deny that it would be reasonable to assume that the extension terms would have been somewhere between the parties' initial negotiating positions, and somewhat closer to Ecuador's initial position than to Perenco's, a reasonable proxy for which is effectively Law 42 at 37.5%. The Eni (AGIP) services contract extension provides strong support for this conclusion. That was a services contract in a neighbouring block in which Ecuador agreed to an eleven-year extension. Perenco specifically considered an AGIP-type contract as part of its contemporaneous extension strategy. Therefore, that contract is a good benchmark for the terms that Ecuador would have accepted for an extension. Perenco noted that Brattle's reports offered no opinion on any extension case.\n\n*[3] Extension would have been in Ecuador's best interests*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nAs for Ecuador's argument that it would have been negligent for the State to extend Perenco's operatorship of Block 7 because the economic proposition was unattractive, Perenco argued that Ecuador's assertion relied on a flawed economic analysis. In Perenco's view, Professor Dow's analysis assessed the value of a Block 7 extension to only extend to the acceleration of investment and production, but failed to assess the benefits of partnering with experienced private contractors. In any event, Professor Dow also undervalued the benefit of such acceleration.\n\n165.\n\nAt the Quantum Hearing, Professor Dow conceded that a contract extension would have resulted in benefits to Ecuador exceeding the amount paid to Perenco and would thus be in Ecuador's best interest.126 Professor Dow admitted that Ecuador's costs of capital during the 2008 to 2010 period were likely to be much higher than Perenco's 12% cost of capital and that in his calculations of the extension value he failed to account for the high opportunity costs of Ecuador's having to invest its own capital in the oil industry instead of in the public sector.127\n\nTr. Q. (5) 1458:1-12, 1560:1-8 (Dow); Tr. Q. (5) 1560:12-1561:3 (Dow). Tr. Q. (5) 1560:20-1561:3 (Dow); *see also* Brattle ER III, paragraph 172.\n\nTr. Q. (5) 1567:16-1568:5 (Dow); Tr. Q.

(5) 1284:20-1285:7 (Kalt).\n\n166.\n\nFurther, Ecuador failed to adduce any evidence to support its claims that its policy to migrate to services contracts and Perenco's allegedly unsatisfactory environmental practices meant that extending Perenco's operatorship was not in Ecuador's interest.128\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 120.\n\n*[4] Perenco had met the conditions for extension under Clause 6.2*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nPerenco asserted further that it had met the two conditions for extension under Clause 6.2.\n\n168.\n\nFirst, its discovery of oil in the Holl\u00edn reservoir in the Oso field met the requirement of discovery of new \"Commercially Exploitable Hydrocarbon Deposits.\" These were \"those deposits of Crude Oil which, in the judgment of the Contractor, are commercial deposits and are included in an approved Development Plan or an Additional Development Plan.\" Perenco did not need to discover new fields. It was immaterial that Perenco had not raised its discovery of the Oso Holl\u00edn deposit as a possible ground for extension in its September 2007 Budget Committee Meeting (\"BCM\").\n\n169.\n\nSecond, it proposed significant new investments during the last five years of the Contract. Perenco had proposed drilling up to 16 further wells in its 2006 Oso Plan of Development and their positive results would have led to substantial further investment which would in turn have been grounds for an extension of the Contract. In September 2007, Perenco also planned to propose additional projects in exchange for a Block 7 extension. Even during the 2008 negotiations, Perenco agreed to a minimum investment of US$110 million in Block 7.\n\n*[5] Perenco would have drilled 70 new wells in the event of an extension to 2018*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nOn the assumption that Block 7 would have been extended, albeit on different terms, Mr. Crick's 'but for' drilling plan for Block 7 focused mainly on the Oso Field. Perenco observes that not only did it propose precisely the 70 wells included in Mr. Crick's programme in its 2008 Internal Review, but Petroamazonas has now drilled some 105 new wells in Oso, and based on its April 2014 Oso Development Plan, it intends to drill 28 more.129 Petroamazonas is on track to drill roughly double the number of Oso wells that Mr. Crick planned.130 This was confirmed at the Quantum Hearing by Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9131 and Mr. Crick.132\n\nCl.

His C.V. includes 37 years' experience performing and supervising reservoir engineering and geological projects including field studies, economic valuations, audits and field unitizations.133\n\nStrickland ER I, paragraphs 5-8.\n\n172.\n\nDr. Strickland reviewed Mr. Crick's plan and noted that these numbers were based on a development plan that Perenco created in late 2008 and appeared reasonable in light of the much greater development of the field that Petroamazonas had since undertaken.134 Since 2009, Petroamazonas had drilled 142 wells in Block 7, 105 of which have been in Oso.135\n\nExhibit Strickland Reference 6, Ryder Scott Report dated 30 June 2013; Exhibit Strickland Reference 11, ECPROD29062, Profundidad Total Pozos.xlsx.\n\nCrick WS II, Appendix U.\n\n173.\n\nPerenco argued that these developments would be carried out during an extension of Perenco's Block 7 operatorship to 2018. The most recent data received from Ecuador in June 2015 indicated that Petroamazonas would shortly be turning its attention to the precise reservoirs that Mr. Crick has slated for waterflooding.136\n\nCl. Rep.

Since the 2008 *acta* terms were the product of what the Tribunal has already held to be coercion,138 terms agreed without such coercion would naturally have been more favourable to Perenco.139\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraphs 606, 609, 612, 686.\n\nTr. Q. (1) 150:20-151:10 (Cl. Opening); see also Cl. Mem. Q., paragraphs 151-152, 177; JK ER III, paragraphs 133-134.\n\n176.\n\nIn Perenco's submission, the Quantum Hearing demonstrated the reasonableness of Professor Kalt's approach to estimating the extension's value. Ecuador did not deny that it would be reasonable to assume that the extension terms would have been somewhere between the parties' initial negotiating positions, and somewhat closer to Ecuador's initial position than to Perenco's, a reasonable proxy for which is effectively Law 42 at 37.5%.140\n\nSee Tr. Q. (1) 147:11-148:14 (Cl. Opening); Tr. Q. (5) 1348:2-8 (Kalt); see also Cl. Mem. Q., paragraphs 148-154, 173-176; Cl. Rep. Q. paragraph 179; d'Argentr\u00e9 WS V paragraphs 24-27; M\u00e1rquez WS II, paragraph 39; JK ER III, paragraphs 130-132.\n\n177.\n\nPerenco's approach towards determining the value of the contract extension is therefore a reasonable proxy for the value that would have been generated in a fair negotiation between the parties had Ecuador never acted unlawfully. Perenco has even assumed that Ecuador would have done better in the negotiations and adjusted the bid-and-ask meeting point to the lower quartile of the difference between Perenco's 'best case' scenario (no Law 42) and Ecuador's 'best case' scenario (Law 42 at 50%).141\n\nKalt ER III, paragraphs 130-132.\n\n178.\n\nIn Perenco's submission, the AGIP services contract extension142 provides strong support for this conclusion.143 That was a services contract (hence consistent with Ecuador's claimed policy direction) in a neighbouring block in which Ecuador agreed to an 11-year extension, so it was nearly 40% longer than the period of the extension that Perenco claims in this arbitration. Perenco specifically considered an AGIP-type contract as part of its contemporaneous \"extension strategy.\"144 Therefore, the contract is a good benchmark for the terms Ecuador would have accepted for an extension. Whether it is used to corroborate Professor Kalt's approach145, or as a substitute approach, the result is comparable.\n\nCE-328.\n\n*Cf.* Tr. Q. (1) 149:16-150:1 (Cl. Opening); Cl. Mem.

(5) 1448:21-1449:2 (Kalt) and Kalt ER IV, paragraphs 5, 9, 125-126; JK-64.\n\n179.\n\nRelying upon Professor Kalt's analysis, Perenco argued that the quantum of damages owed to Perenco in respect to the extension of Block 7 is in the area of US$600 to 625 million (US$626 million based on Law 42 at 37.5% or US$604 million based on the AGIP contract, used as a proxy for which Perenco and Ecuador would have agreed in the 'but for' world).146\n\nKalt ER IV, Exhibit JK-64.\n\n*(ii) Ecuador's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n180.\n\nEcuador argued that Block 7 would not have been extended for a variety of reasons, including: (i) Ecuador had the discretion to grant or not an extension, but not to extend it on different terms; (ii) it would not have been in the State's interests to grant the extension; and (iii) Perenco had not met the requirements to trigger the exercise of discretion under Clause 6.2 of the Contract. The issue before the Tribunal was whether the Participation Contract should somehow be extended, not whether it would have been renegotiated into an AGIP-kind of services contract. Moreover, the facts showed that renegotiation failed due to, among other reasons, Burlington's decision not to engage in a renegotiation but rather to exit Ecuador.147\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 20.\n\n*[1] Ecuador enjoyed ample discretion to grant or not an extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nEcuador argued that the Quantum Hearing demonstrated that Clause 6.2 of the Block 7 Participation Contract encompassed two layers of discretion \u2013 the State: (i) \"*may*\" extend the existing contract; and (ii) \"*if and when it is in the State's best interest*\" \u2013 which discretion was triggered, if and only if, at least one of the three technical requirements under Clause 6.2 was satisfied.\n\n182.\n\nAs to the first layer of discretion, the wording of Clause 6.2 of the Contract was clear (\"\u2026 *this term may be extended, if and when it is in the State's best interest, for the following reasons* \u2026\" [Emphasis added.]). This granted ample discretion to Ecuador to decide whether to extend, or not, the term of the existing Contract's Production Period. In Ecuador's view, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose was unable to escape the language of Clause 6.2148 and Mr. Perrodo had candidly recognised Ecuador's discretionary power to grant or not an extension.149\n\nTr. Q. (4) 921:14-21 (P\u00e9rez Loose).\n\nTr. Q. (2) 562: 17-563:18 (Perrodo).\n\n183.\n\nEcuador criticised Perenco's proposed interpretation for failing to give effect to the expressed intention of the parties150; it did not give effect to Clause 6.2 as a whole151 as Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose ultimately acknowledged under cross-examination152; and the word \"*shall*\" in sub-clause 6.2.3 could not override the word \"*may*\" in the *chapeau* of Clause 6.2 which commanded the entire provision. Sub-clause 6.2.3 related to the act of obtaining the prior agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and the approval of the Special Bidding Committee.\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraph 30.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 31.\n\nTr. Q. (4) 827:2-929:6 (P\u00e9rez Loose).\n\n184.\n\nPerenco also could not prove a purported practice in Ecuador of extending all oil contracts because there was no such practice. As Dr. D\u00e1valos had testified, there were two instances (Texaco and Sinopec) when Ecuador had not granted an extension because they were not in its best interests.153 Even if there were such a practice, this could not legally override the discretion that Ecuador held under Clause 6.2.\n\nTr. Q. (3) 792:12-793:8 and Tr. Q. (3) 830:10-832:5 (D\u00e1valos).\n\n185.\n\nFinally, Perenco could not rely on the good faith principle under Ecuadorian law to transform the word \"*may*\" into \"*shall*.\"\n\n*[2] An extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract would not have been in the State's best interest*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nClause 6.2 provided a second layer of discretion reserved to the State, given that the Production Period may only be extended \"*if and when it is in the State's best interest*.\" As Dr. Aguilar explained, in establishing the public interest, the State must see first whether the event has occurred. If that occurred, the next step was to decide whether or not it was appropriate to extend the Contract.154 Extending the Participation Contract would not have been in Ecuador's best interests for the following reasons.\n\nTr. Q. (4) 985:10-12 (Aguilar).\n\n187.\n\nFirst, Ecuador had chosen at the relevant time to adopt a policy of migration from participation contracts to services contracts. Contrary to Perenco's contention, Ecuador's witnesses had testified to the failed renegotiation of the Participation Contracts and not to the potential extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract.155 Even if Perenco argued that it would have accepted a different model for the extension of its Block 7 operatorship, Perenco had only calculated the Block 7 extension value based on Law 42 at 37.5%; this must mean that this was an extension under a participation contract (as Law 42 only applied to such contracts), Perenco's last minute change of the basis of its valuation to employ AGIP's services contract must be therefore be dismissed outright.\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 21.\n\n188.\n\nSecond, it would have been uneconomical for Ecuador. Ecuador was not just guided by economic gain, but by a plethora of objectives. Perenco's expert, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose, was forced to retract his proposition that the State's interests were reduced to obtaining the largest amount of oil possible, as he ultimately admitted that they encompassed other issues, such as health, the environment, defence, *etc*.156 Perenco could not rely on *ex post facto* evidence from its own witnesses as to the purported benefits of an extension, and that it was a high priority for Perenco, to argue that Parties would have agreed on the extension.157\n\nTr. Q. (4) 935:20-936:15 and Tr. Q. (3) 904:18-905:1 (P\u00e9rez Loose).\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 22.\n\n189.\n\nThird, Perenco was not a responsible environmental steward, and it would likely be held liable for having caused contamination in the Blocks.\n\n*[3] Perenco did not meet the technical requirements under Clause 6.2*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nPerenco suggested that Ecuador had not disproved at the Quantum Hearing that the two technical requirements in Clause 6.2 invoked by Perenco were met. On the one hand, the burden of proof falls on Perenco. On the other hand, and as shown by Ecuador in its Post-Hearing Brief158, Perenco failed to demonstrate that it satisfied even one of the technical requirements under Clause 6.2.\n\nResp. PHB Q., Section 3.1.3.\n\n191.\n\nIn this respect, Perenco failed to show that it had discovered new Commercially Exploitable Hydrocarbon Deposits as an exclusive result of new exploration work pursuant to Clause 6.2.3. The evidence adduced at the Quantum Hearing confirmed that Perenco benefited from existing log data already showing the presence of oil in the Holl\u00edn. Mr. Combe also confirmed that BP, Perenco's predecessor in the Block, had conducted the first exploration activities at Oso in the 1980s.159 The presence of oil was confirmed in 1988160 and Perenco was in possession of this information before it drilled Oso 3.161\n\nTr.

(2) 350:5-16 (Combe).\n\n192.\n\nTherefore, Perenco had not included this alleged discovery when it drilled the Oso 3 well in the Holl\u00edn reservoir as part of its strategy for extension in the September 2007 Budget Committee Meeting. Nor did it allocate any value to an extension when it calculated the NPV of its investment in 2007.\n\n193.\n\nPerenco did not propose significant new investments before the Participation Contract's expiry in order to qualify for an extension. The Quantum Hearing confirmed that Perenco knew full well that an extension of the Production Period was uncertain. As a consequence, from 2007 onwards, Perenco acted accordingly and accelerated investments and project development to ensure payback within the contract's term:\n\n\"Q. So, Mr. Perrodo, is it fair to say that, from 2007, absent a contract extension, Perenco would only make investments in Block 7 that could be amortized or paid back before August 2010?\n\nA. [\u2026] my decision was to, you know, make as much money as possible in case, you know, we wouldn't be granted an extension, which is clearly not what we wished for, but that's the reason why we decided to accelerate the developments.\"162\n\nTr. Q. (2) 562:5-8, 14-18 (Perrodo). See also Perrodo WS II, paragraphs 6-7.\n\n*[4] Even in a hypothetical extension scenario, Mr. Crick's drilling programme would not have occurred*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nEcuador further criticises Perenco's Block 7 extension scenario, with the 127-well163 waterflood project advocated by Mr. Crick, as being yet another \"cynical attempt by Perenco to grossly inflate\" its claim.164 Mr. Crick had based his forecast on a flawed methodology. This flaw was most readily apparent from the significant discrepancy between Mr. Crick's forecasted production and the actual production from the Oso field.\n\nTr. Q. (3) 623:22 -624:2 (Crick's Direct Presentation): \"Had there been an extension, we would have drilled 70 wells and an additional 120 wells for waterflooding in other Block 7 reservoirs.\"\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph.76.\n\n195.\n\nThe only 2 single well pilot projects undertaken at the Lobo and Coca-Payamino fields failed to establish the continuity of the Napo U formation rock, the cornerstone for a successful waterflood project. Confronted with the fact that the pilot well at Lobo did not have the same impact on two equidistant wells, Mr. Crick conceded that this could be due to the discontinuity of the formation rock in this field.165 Dr. Strickland was also forced to acknowledge that the results from the limited study undertaken (*i.e.,* one injector well in each of the Lobo and Payamino fields) show heterogeneity (or discontinuity) in the tested Napo reservoir.166\n\nTr. Q. (3) 723:4-9 (Crick).\n\nTr. Q. (4) 1052:2 (Strickland).\n\n196.\n\nPerenco's subsequent attempt to argue that Mr. Crick's \"5-spot\" development pattern would de-risk the development and account for any discontinuities only reinforced the inconclusive results obtained by the Consortium. Perenco was equally misplaced in seeking to support Mr. Crick's 127-well waterflood project through documents reflecting the risky investments proposed by the Consortium during the contract extension negotiations.167 In fact, Ecuador argued, these documents: (i) showed that the Consortium was only contemplating a maximum of 29 waterflood wells in an extension scenario;, and (ii) did not even mention a '5-spot' development pattern.168\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 30.\n\nCrick WS II, Appendix L, Slides 114-119.\n\n197.\n\nEcuador argued that Perenco persisted with Mr. Crick's 37-well waterflood project in the Basal Tena reservoir in Coca-Payamino without even having undertaken any pilot testing in this reservoir and notwithstanding Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9's acknowledging that, for a waterflood project to work, the concept must first be proved in the reservoir.169 Even Dr. Strickland had to concede that, \"[i]n the Basal Tena, [\u2026] the waterflood reserves are more uncertain there because no pilot has been instigated\" causing \"greater uncertainty,\"170 thereby further undermining Mr. Crick's waterflood project.\n\nResp.

Indeed, Ryder Scott \u2014a company specialised in waterflood projects171\u2014 had not once mentioned it in its reports to Petroamazonas.\n\nCE-333, p. 2.\n\n199.\n\nFinally, Perenco was incorrect in alleging that Mr. Combe and Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9 provided support for Mr. Crick's waterflood project. Mr. Combe never even addressed waterflooding.172 Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9 did, but his testimony could hardly be presented as supporting Mr. Crick's extensive waterflood project given that: (i) he did not know how many wells Mr. Crick was proposing to drill as part of this project; and (ii) he did not think Mr. Crick was proposing a lot of development in those fields, because they were already developed.173 Perenco failed to point to any evidence indicating that the Consortium partners were considering to embark upon Mr. Crick's extensive and costly waterflood project in the northern part of the Block. Mr. Combe conceded that the Consortium \"envisioned that all the development or future development would be around Oso.\"174\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 76.\n\nTr. Q.

(2) 326:16-17 (Combe).\n\n*[5] Form and value of an extension*\n------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nEcuador argued that both sides' experts confirmed at the Hearing the unreasonableness of Perenco's extraordinarily high extension value (presenting over 40% of Perenco's claimed damages). The DCF analysis should not include a hypothetical extension, even more so when Perenco's contemporaneous assumptions did not assign any value to a potential extension.\n\n201.\n\nIn assessing the purported value of a hypothetical extension, Professor Kalt did not apply the terms of the *Actas de Acuerdo Parcial* of 2008. Instead, Perenco came up with its own terms for a new contract.175 Professor Kalt did not calculate a value for a renegotiated services contract (in light of Ecuador's policy to migrate to services contracts), and therefore Perenco failed to discharge its burden of proof.\n\nKalt ER IV, paragraph 126 \u2013 damages due to Perenco assuming the extension terms contained in the *Actas de Acuerdo Parcial* of 2008 would amount to US$1,144 million as of July 2015.\n\n202.\n\nOn the economics of extension, the issue was not whether extension could have created benefits for Ecuador, but what price Ecuador would have been willing to pay for those benefits. Perenco's terms assumed that Ecuador would have agreed to pay more than the economic benefits it could have expected from an extension. Brattle amply demonstrated that it would have made no economic sense for Ecuador to agree to an extension on Perenco's terms because they gave \"more than 100 percent share of the [value generated by the extension] for the Contractor.\"176\n\nTr. Q. (5) 1463:1-1464:7 (Dow); Brattle ER II, paragraphs 141-176; Brattle ER III, paragraphs 137-155.\n\n203.\n\nEcuador framed the issue as follows: Ecuador would agree to pay Perenco on top of the standard return an additional US$626 million for Perenco to continue operating Block 7 until 2018 when Ecuador was due to receive the fields for free in August 2010 (*i.e.* at contract expiration) and any contractor could have taken over the operations then \u2013 only if Perenco offered Ecuador benefits no other contractor could. The only unique benefit Perenco could articulate at the Quantum Hearing was Mr. Crick's purported knowledge of the fields \u2013 and that Ecuador would have granted an 800% IRR which Professor Kalt asserted would be worth $968 million.177 However, this would already be part of the costs in Brattle's model, together with the other benefits that any other operator could provide. Thus, Ecuador's cost of borrowing is irrelevant: Ecuador could contract with another private contractor, as it did with YPF in Block 21.\n\nTr. Q.

Brattle had assumed that Ecuador would pay for an extension the standard return (discount rate) offered to contractors (*i.e.* 12%).\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 122.\n\n205.\n\nFinally, Ecuador pointed out that Perenco's claim (to justify its unrealistic extension terms) that Ecuador agreed in the AGIP contract to a 25% rate of return on invested capital was misleading because (i) the 25% rate of return in the AGIP contract relates exclusively to investments in exploration or secondary recovery techniques, *i.e.* high-risk investments179; and (ii) for production from existing fields, the AGIP contract sets a $35 tariff/barrel produced. The AGIP contract was thus not a good comparable to Block 7.\n\nE-379, AGIP Contract dated 23 November 2010, Clause 12.3.\n\n*(iii)The Tribunal's Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered this important issue and begins by setting out some general findings that have guided its analysis.\n\n207.\n\nFirst, it takes note of the submissions concerning the precise wording of Clause 6.2 of the Participation Contract. It accepts Ecuador's argument that the State had a substantial measure of discretion when it came to deciding whether to grant an extension. Perenco itself accepted that Clause 6.2 was discretionary and the Tribunal did not find persuasive Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose's attempt to narrow the scope of Ecuador's discretion so as to make contract extension virtually mandatory.180\n\nTr. Q. (4) 932:20-933:8 (P\u00e9rez Loose); *see also* Tr. Q. (3) 903:4-10 (P\u00e9rez Loose), Tr. Q. (4) 924:6-10, 928:3- 8 (P\u00e9rez Loose); Loose ER VII, paragraph 52.\n\n208.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal considers that even in the 'but for' world an \"extension\" would at its best, from Perenco's perspective, not have entailed an extension of the existing Participation Contract, but rather the Parties would have agreed that a new model would govern their relationship. Given the way in which the Parties' arguments developed, the Tribunal considers that Perenco essentially conceded this to be the case.181 Hence its argument that a services contract in some form would be granted and Law 42 at 37.5% was used as a proxy for the specific terms that the Parties could have agreed for the extension period had Ecuador not acted unlawfully.182 Third, the Tribunal takes note of Ecuador's evidence that some contracts were not extended.183 This however is not very compelling evidence; Mr. D\u00e1valos, when cross-examined on this point, was able to identify only two such instances of non-extension over the past three decades.184 Moreover, Ecuador did not tender any witnesses to testify that the State would not have extended the operatorship at issue in the instant case and given that earlier in the proceeding, different witnesses, including former ministers, conceded that Ecuador wanted Perenco to continue to operate, the absence of such testimony is telling.\n\nPerenco asserted: \"Ecuador's reading of Clause 6.2 to permit only an extension of the expiration date of the Block 7 Contract, and no amendments to any other terms, is unsupported by the contractual language and unrealistic.\" (Cl. Rep. Q., paragraph 164).\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 171. See also Cl. PHB Q., paragraph 120: \"The unrebutted evidence also shows that Perenco was open to concluding a reasonable services contract for the extension period. Cf. Tr. Q. (1) 137:14-16 (Cl.

As counsel for Perenco pointed out in closing argument:\n\n\"\u2026 in 2010, Ecuador executed seven amended contracts, extending the terms of all of them, and in 2014, Ecuador extended the terms of three expiring Services Contracts with another three operators. Thus, even if Ecuador had discretion to grant an extension, so long as it was exercised in good faith, the facts compel a conclusion that Ecuador would, indeed, have extended Perenco's term in Block 7.\"185\n\nTr. Q. (6) 1701:6-14.\n\n210.\n\nThe evidence of extensions also accords with common sense. There are considerations of convenience resulting from the incumbent's knowledge of and experience with the unique operating characteristics of each oilfield, the operator's access to a lower cost of capital than that which the State could achieve186, the professional relationships between operators and their counterparts in the State's regulatory apparatus, and so on.\n\nTr. Q. (5) 1567:16-1568:5 (Dow); Tr. Q. (5) 1462:14-16 (Dow); *cf.* Tr. Q. (5) 1284:20-1285:7 (Kalt).\n\n211.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced that there is substantial evidence that, all other things being equal, senior officials and ministers of Ecuador would have preferred that Perenco continue its operatorship of Block 7 rather than its leaving the Block. There is a substantial body of evidence on the record to support this finding in addition to the general evidence showing that Ecuador tended to extend operatorships.187\n\nAs pointed out by Perenco in Cl. Mem. Q., paragraph 146: \"In 2010 alone, Ecuador executed seven amended oil contracts, extending the terms of six of the original contracts by between six and fifteen years. See http://www.hidrocarburos.gob.ec/biblioteca/ (website of the Hydrocarbons Secretariat, containing links to the amended contracts for Block 10, Block 14, Block 16, Block 17, MDC, PBHI, and Tarapoa).\" See also CE-331 and CE-332.\n\n212.\n\nThe fundamental problem for the extension claim is that it is not possible, on the evidence before it, for the Tribunal to know *what* contractual terms might have been arrived at in a successful negotiation but for the unlawful acts. Having regard to the situation in the last quarter of calendar year 2008, the Tribunal recalls that, as Perenco asserted in its pleadings during the merits phase, it did sign the Minutes of Partial Agreement (the actual title of the *Actas*), and did what it could to reach a solution acceptable to all parties.188 But it faced Burlington's disinterest, Ecuador's insistence that both members of the Consortium agree to the new arrangement, and the fact that the minutes themselves did not constitute a binding legal agreement.\n\nCl. Rep. M., paragraph 490.\n\n213.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal recalls what Perenco asserted during the merits phase of the arbitration:\n\nThe Minutes were, rather, without prejudice minutes of the parties' negotiations, which set forth certain commercial issues on the basis of which the parties agreed to continue their negotiations. RMP WS \u00b6\u00b6 31-33, 58-59. The Minutes contained an express reservation of all rights; they stated on their face that they were not binding; and they expressly referred to the need for all parties (including Burlington) to execute duly agreed contractual modifications before any of the points recorded in the Minutes could take effect. See RMP WS \u00b6 32; see also, e.g., E-84, p. 2 (\"The parties declare that the information contained in the present Minutes of Partial Agreement... will not be binding.\"); ibid. p. 2 (\"The parties declare that these agreements will be incorporated into the general negotiations that will take place in the following days and will concern mainly the following points: Arbitration and Mediation Clause....\"); E-87, \u00b6 6 and E-89, \u00b6 8 (\"For the application and validity of this agreement the parties shall negotiate and execute the Transitory Participation Contracts....\"); E-87, p. 2 (\"This agreement is without prejudice and does not constitute a waiver of the rights to which Perenco Ecuador Limited and PETROECUADOR believe they are entitled....\") and E-89, p. 2 (\"The agreements contained in these minutes are without prejudice and do not constitute a waiver of the rights to which Perenco Ecuador Limited and PETROECUADOR believe they are entitled....\"). It was perfectly clear to all concerned that no binding agreement modifying the Contracts could be reached without Burlington's agreement. See also GCZ WS \u00b6 24 (acknowledging the Minutes were subject to Burlington approval).189 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 491.\n\n214.\n\nIndeed, when defending its inability to persuade Burlington to continue negotiations, Perenco argued that \"Burlington cannot be faulted for refusing to accept *the vague, incomplete and risky substitute contract* it was being offered *and to take on faith that its economic interests would be preserved*. \"190 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 495.\n\n215.\n\nThis is the fundamental difficulty facing this claim. The October 2008 *Acta*, which is the last indication of an apparent shared 'in principle' intention to establish a contractual basis for the Consortium's continued operation of Block 7, was in the form of \"minutes\" and itself was not put into final legal form. The intention of the parties at the time was that, if finally agreed, the *Acta* would be a transitory agreement that would be succeeded by some form of services contract. But the final expression of the *Acta* itself, let alone the expression of the parties' respective rights and obligations in the contract that would follow, were never reduced to writing. In the end, the Tribunal considers that Perenco's characterisation of the *Acta* as a \"*vague, incomplete and risky substitute contract*\" illustrates the inherent difficulties of choosing a proxy for the Block 7 extension scenario.\n\n216.\n\nPerenco saw the AGIP Contract as a proxy for what would have happened to Block 7 and adverted to the fact that it had considered a contract of this type as part of its extension negotiation strategy.191 This part of its damages claim therefore married together the financial aspects of that contract with Mr. Crick's 'but for' drilling programme for Block 7.\n\nSee Cl. PHB Q., paragraph 130: \"The Eni (AGIP) services contract extension (CE-328) provides strong support for this conclusion. Cf. Tr. Q. (1) 149:16-150:1 (Cl. Opening); PMQ \u00b6 153. That was a services contract (hence consistent with Ecuador's claimed policy direction) in a neighboring block in which Ecuador agreed to an eleven-year extension, so one that was nearly 40% longer than what Perenco claims in this arbitration. Perenco specifically considered an Eni-type contract as part of its contemporaneous 'extension strategy' *See, e.g.,* **E-387**, Slides 105, 107; **BR-32**, Slides 36-37; see also Tr. Q. (1) 149:16-150:1 (Cl. Opening), PMQ \u00b6 153. \"Therefore, the Eni contract is a good benchmark for the terms Ecuador would have accepted for an extension. Whether it is used to corroborate Prof. Kalt's approach (see Tr. Q. (5) 1448:21-1449:2 (Kalt); JK ER IV \u00b6\u00b6 5, 9, 125-126; JK-64), or as a substitute approach, the result is comparable.\"\n\n217.\n\nBut this approach founders on Perenco's concession that there is no record evidence that *Ecuador* ever considered that the AGIP Contract could be a model for an extension of the Block 7 operatorship for Perenco.192 For all of these reasons, the idea of employing a services contract like the Block 10 AGIP Contract as a proxy for what might or might not have been agreed for Block 7 is, in the end, a bridge too far for the Tribunal.\n\nTr. Q. (6) 1704:8-12 (Claimant's Closing Argument).\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal has also taken note of the fact that much of Perenco's damages analysis is based on what Petroamazonas has done since it assumed operation of the Blocks. But the Tribunal is not convinced that the economics of the operations of Petroamazonas, a State\u2013 owned entity, provides an appropriate \"apples to apples\" comparator of what Perenco would have done in the 'but for' scenario.193\n\n*Murphy v. Ecuador* took a similar approach in rejecting that claimant's reliance on what Repsol achieved in after it took over operations from Murphy. See *Murphy v. Ecuador*, paragraph 485.\n\n219.\n\nAs a matter of law, the Tribunal is also mindful of the fact that the decisions of international courts, tribunals, and claims commissions show that while financially assessable damages are to be awarded, the adjudicator must seek to avoid awarding speculative damages. As the *BG Group* tribunal noted:\n\n\"\u2026Damages that are 'too indirect, remote, and uncertain to be appraised' are to be excluded. In line with this principle, the Tribunal would add that an award for damages which are speculative would equally run afoul of \"full reparation\" under the ILC Draft Articles.\"194\n\nCA-004, *BG Group v. Argentine Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 24 December 2007, paragraph 428.\n\n220.\n\nHaving regard to all of the circumstances, therefore, the Tribunal considers that it is too remote, uncertain and ultimately too speculative to accept Perenco's extension argument, particularly when Perenco itself accepted that it is necessary to use other contractual models as a proxy for what *might* have been agreed between the Parties. At the end of the day, it simply cannot be ruled out that the Parties might have been unable to arrive at an agreement or for its own reasons the State might have simply decided in an exercise of its lawful discretion not to extend the Block 7 contract. There is, therefore, in the present circumstances an insufficient degree of confidence as to the terms of a contract that might have been concluded such that there could be an estimate of lost cash flows.\n\n221.\n\nAll of that said, the Tribunal is firmly of the view that Perenco has adduced persuasive evidence that it suffered a loss of opportunity and further that this loss is compensable. The Tribunal notes in this regard that the *Burlington* tribunal found that the claimant in that case did not make out its 'loss of opportunity' claim. But this points to a key difference in the facts before the *Burlington* tribunal and those before the present Tribunal. The *Burlington* tribunal appears to have been influenced by the fact that Burlington itself appeared to have assigned a zero value to the chance of a contract extension in 2007.195 The evidence before the present Tribunal is quite different. As the Tribunal's Decision on Liability found, Perenco sought ways to preserve its presence in Ecuador and to arrive at some form of accommodation with the State.196 Indeed, the Tribunal found that Ecuador's holding Burlington's recalcitrance against Perenco constituted a breach of the Treaty.197 It also appears that Burlington and Perenco argued over the course of action to be followed.198 In these circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that in the 'but for' world of dealings between Perenco and Ecuador, there was a real opportunity for the incumbent operator to extend its operation of Block 7, which opportunity was lost due to the unlawful conduct of the State.\n\n*Burlington* award, paragraph 282.\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraphs 620-625.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 626.\n\nE-91, Letter from Burlington to Perenco dated 16 December 2008 in which Burlington: \"...wish[ed] to clarify that Burlington is not under any legal obligation of any kind to sign the draft agreements. Burlington is entitled to stand on its rights under existing PSCs, and those rights cannot be modified without Burlington's effective participation.\"\n\n222.\n\nThe loss of opportunity is thus established and compensable and the Tribunal's estimate of that loss is addressed below in Section II.I.10.\n\n223.\n\nThe upshot of the foregoing analysis is that since the Tribunal has found that it cannot assume that the extension of Block 7 would have been based on the AGIP contract or some other proxy, Mr. Crick's drilling plans for Block 7 for the period after the date of the Block 7 Contract's expiry on 16 August 2010 cannot be taken into consideration. With the Participation Contract's having come to an end shortly after the expropriation, there is no basis for considering the hypothetical drilling plans that might have been implemented had the Contract been extended.199\n\nThe *Burlington* tribunal reached the same conclusion. *Burlington* award, paragraphs 271-278.\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the 'but for' drilling scenarios.\n\n*(b) Block 7 'but for' drilling programme from Decree 662 to August 2010*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nSince the Block 7 Participation Contract expired in August 2010 and in light of the Tribunal's finding above, the Tribunal is concerned only with the impact of Decree 662 upon the Consortium's drilling activities in Block 7 up to August 2010.\n\n*(i) Perenco's position*\n------------------------\n\n226.\n\nHaving regard to the August 2010 contract expiry scenario, Mr. Crick estimated that 21 new wells (of a total of 70 new wells in the extension scenario) would be drilled. Perenco notes that, as Mr. Crick explained, for the Oso 19-26 grouping, the average well had a 6-month payback period and outperformed even the \"high case\" predicted at the time of drilling.200 In fact, Oso 23, the last well that Perenco drilled shortly after Decree 662 was promulgated, was the best well yet.201\n\nCrick Direct Presentation Q., Slide 9.\n\nCrick WS III, paragraph 156.\n\n227.\n\nPerenco argued that with three years remaining on the Block 7 Contract, in October 2007 it was far from being in a \"shut-down mode\" and the Consortium was not intending to limit Block 7 drilling to Oso wells which were expected to pay out the drilling investment by mid-2007. Following completion of the 8 firm Oso wells in the 2006 Plan of Development (\"POD\"), the Consortium would have begun drilling the 8 contingent wells contemplated by the Plan; those wells would have been re-categorised as \"firm\" wells. Perenco noted in this regard that it was common practice in Ecuador to budget only \"firm\" wells, with the operator later submitting budget adjustments when the \"contingent\" wells were moved into the \"firm\" category.202\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 81, citing Crick WS III, paragraph 147; d'Argentr\u00e9 WS IV, paragraphs 9-11, Combe WS III, paragraph 9.\n\n228.\n\nBoth Mr. Combe and Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9 testified that the September 2007 BCM presentation showed that Perenco had substantially expanded its estimates of Oso's oil in place and planned to move more personnel to Oso and to build a new camp to accommodate them, and further that the Consortium had constructed the infrastructure backbone for further Oso development.203 Perenco needed time to process the \"exciting results\" from the firm wells before choosing additional locations.204 A rig was available to keep drilling.205\n\nTr.

(2) 435:1-8 (Combe).\n\n229.\n\nBut for Decree 662, Perenco argued, it would have continued to drill one well per month in Oso, just as it was doing at the time that Decree 662 came into effect and it would have continued this drilling programme for as long as it remained profitable to do so.206 Perenco asserted that this ought not to be controversial: further Oso wells would undeniably produce new reserves207 and Perenco indisputably had previously achieved a one-well-per-month drilling schedule in Oso.208\n\nTr.

Q., paragraph 25; Chart of Block 7 Wells submitted on 15 December 2015.\n\n230.\n\nNo reasonable operator, amid rising oil prices and excellent results, would decide not to drill further wells.209 As soon as contract renegotiations were underway, Perenco proposed initially 33, then 70, new Oso drilling locations \u2013 hardly a hallmark of disappointment (as alleged by RPS).210 Perenco would have continued drilling further wells so long as they would pay for themselves and make a return prior to contract expiry. Such further drilling would have been particularly attractive given the high oil price environment, and given the fact that estimates of the amount of oil in Oso \"only grew with each new batch of wells.\"211 (Perenco noted in this regard that Petroamazonas' estimates for Oso have continued this trend, indeed coming in much higher than Perenco's highest estimate.212)\n\nCl. PHB. Q., paragraph 28.\n\nSee Exhibit BR-31, Slide 35 (2008 MTO); Crick WS II, Appendix L, Slides 31-32.\n\nCl. Rep.

Q., paragraph 82 referring to Crick WS II, Appendix T; Crick WS III, paragraph 144 and Appendix P.\n\n231.\n\nThe only \"uncertainty\" was whether Oso was \"excellent or merely very good.\"213 While RPS asserted that the Oso field was not as promising as Mr. Crick asserted on the basis of four of the 13 Main Holl\u00edn wells that were already off production prior to June 2007, Dr. Strickland explained that in any given field, the number of \"bad\" wells can be expected to exceed the number of \"good\" wells.214 For RPS to imply that Oso was somehow a poor performer based on the number of wells that had been taken off production was seriously misleading. The only reason for halting drilling at Oso was Decree 662's promulgation.215\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 84 referring to Crick WS III, paragraph 154; Combe WS III, paragraph 13.\n\nCl. Rep.

Q., paragraph 46 referring to d'Argentr\u00e9 WS V, paragraph 13.\n\n232.\n\nAs for the Lobo and Coca-Payamino fields, Mr. Crick also forecasted waterflood developments.216 These were noted in Perenco's 2008 Internal Review and in the September 2007 BCM.217 Dr. Strickland explained that this meant that produced water would be re-injected into the reservoir. He reviewed the Perenco pilot waterflood results and found that they showed the required good communication between the wells to implement a waterflood development. He further confirmed that Mr. Crick's methodology was consistent with industry practice and the proposed waterflood projects should be successful.218 (Perenco also contended that this was validated by Ryder Scott, which had produced a reserves report for Petroamazonas in June 2013.219)\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 90.\n\nCl. Rep.

Dr. Strickland's own production numbers were:220\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Block 7****Existing Wells Forecast Expected Ultimate Recovery (MMStb) Initial Production to 8/16/2018** |\n|  | **Forecast Method** |\n| **Field Name** | **Rate Time** | **Rate Cum** | **Average of** |\n|  | **MMStb** | **MMStb** | **Methods** |\n| **Oso** | **19.9** | **19.8** |  |\n| **Lobo** | **6.5** | **6.5** |  |\n| **Coco-Payamino** | **67.1** | **67.1** |  |\n| **All Others** | **22.7** | **22.7** |  |\n| **Sum of Block 7 Fields** | **116.2** | **116.1** | **116.2** |\n| **Analysis of John Crick** |  |  | **118.5** |\n\nStrickland ER II, paragraph 68.\n\n234.\n\nDr. Strickland noted that Mr. Crick had used Petroamazonas' own production rates and used decline curve analysis. Dr. Strickland conducted an analysis of wells in Coca-Payamino, Oso and Lobo and combined Mono and Gacela. In applying the *'* production performance analysis'/'decline curve analysis' methodologies,221 Dr. Strickland found that the *'Water to Oil Ratio vs Cumulative*' method did not result in trends that could be conscientiously extrapolated to make a reliable forecast.222 He instead summed up the results obtained using the *'Rate vs Time*' and *'Rate vs Cumulative*' methodologies to obtain the Expected Ultimate Recovery (\"EUR\") for Block 7.\n\nStrickland ER I, paragraph 42: (1) Rate *vs* Time; (2) Type Curve; (3) Rate *vs* Cumulative; (4) Water to Oil Ratio *vs* Cumulative.\n\nStrickland ER I, paragraph 81.\n\n235.\n\nAll the fields except Lobo exhibited good trends under both methodologies. Lobo was the exception because that field was still being developed with the drilling of additional wells, such that the decline curve had not yet settled. Dr. Strickland made what he called a conservative extrapolation for Lobo. He then summed the EURs for the fields calculated under each technique to determine the cumulative EUR for existing wells in Block 7. He averaged the EUR calculated and compared it to Mr. Crick's calculated EUR. Dr. Strickland found that Mr. Crick's EUR (118.5 MMStb) was a very close match to Dr. Strickland's EUR of 116.6 MMStb (higher only by 2%).223 Mr. Crick's forecasts for the existing wells were thus in his view valid and reliable.\n\n*Ibid.* paragraph 84.\n\n236.\n\nIn response to RPS's argument that these developments were too uncertain and risky, during the Quantum Hearing both Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland testified that the proposed \"5-spot\" development pattern for the waterfloods would effectively de-risk the development and account for any minor discontinuities in the reservoirs.224\n\nTr. Q. (3) 729:17-731:10 (Crick); Tr. Q. (4) 1051:20-1052:7 (Strickland).\n\n*(ii) Ecuador's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n237.\n\nIn Ecuador's view, the Quantum Hearing demonstrated that the Consortium did not intend to extend its drilling campaign at Oso beyond its 8-well commitment (*i.e.*, up to Oso 26).225 The only additional drilling that the Consortium was envisaging beyond that was in the form of \"risky\" investments intended at the time to satisfy the investment requirement to be considered for an extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract. The Consortium, in short, was in a shut-down mode unless and until it was granted an extension.226 RPS's conclusion that the Consortium would only have drilled up to 3 wells reflected the strategy set out in the September 2007 BCM and other contemporaneous documents227, that is, that there would be no further drilling of the Oso Main Holl\u00edn reservoir beyond Oso 26, and the focus instead would be on \"new investment\" projects to be undertaken if negotiations for the extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract succeeded.\n\nTr. Q. (2) 503:20-504:4 (d'Argentr\u00e9).\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 72.\n\nRPS ER V, paragraph 32; E-415, Consortium's Budget Committee Meeting Presentation, 28 September 2006; E-412, Consortium's Budget Committee Minutes, 28 September 2006; E-314 Information Committee Meeting, December 2006/15, p. 3; E-414, Consortium Presentation, 8 January 2007, p. 29; Exhibit BR-32, MTO Presentation, 22 March 2007, p. 53; E-387, Consortium's Budget Committee Meeting Presentation, 26-27 September 2007, pp. 51-53.\n\n238.\n\nIn response to Perenco's maintaining that even in the absence of an extension being granted it would have drilled 21 new wells at Oso from January 2008 onwards, Ecuador argued that there was no contemporaneous support for this drilling campaign. The September 2007 BCM made no reference to any drilling beyond Oso 26, even though Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9 acknowledged at the Quantum Hearing that such meetings were the forum for discussing further drilling.228 He insisted that \"the technical people on the background were exchanging information and discussing future wells.\"229 Yet Perenco failed to provide proof of such discussions, which only confirmed the lack of evidence in support of its development programme. It was repeatedly made clear that drilling beyond Oso 26 was only envisaged in an extension scenario.230\n\nTr. Q. (2) 510:2-6 (d'Argentr\u00e9).\n\n*Id.*\n\nTr. Q.

(4) 1117:15-1118:18 (RPS).\n\n239.\n\nEcuador argued further that Perenco's reliance upon the proposed construction of a new camp at Oso as proof of the intention to engage in further drilling was misplaced, because it was not the \"infrastructure backbone for further Oso development\"231, but rather was foreseen to rationalise existing production operations in Block 7.232\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 28.\n\nE-387, Consortium's Budget Committee Meeting Presentation, 26-27 September 2007, p. 93.\n\n240.\n\nAs conceded by Dr. Strickland at the Quantum Hearing, the commercially exploitable boundaries (or outer edges) to the south, east and north of the Oso field had all been reached by August 2006.233 By late 2007, it only remained to be determined how far the Main Holl\u00edn reservoir extended to the west following the promising, yet still preliminary, results from Oso 21. As pointed out by RPS, faced with this uncertainty, Perenco had decided upon the safer option of infill drilling for the last three Oso wells contemplated on the eve of Decree 662, rather than investing in further (riskier) wells to probe the western flank of that field. Perenco was thus in a \"shut-down mode\" pending an extension being secured for Block 7.\n\nTr. Q. (4) 1077:9-1080:21 (Strickland).\n\n241.\n\nIn fact, on the eve of Decree 662, Block 7 was not the success story that Perenco was now presenting. First, Perenco misleadingly relied on the Oso mapping update following the results of Oso 21 to suggest that the Consortium \"substantially expanded its estimates of Oso's oil in place based on drilling results.\"234 However, this increase was only reflected in the maps and was not further mentioned nor quantified during the September 2007 BCM.235 More importantly, if the Consortium was as enthusiastic about Oso at the time as Perenco contended, the increase of oil in place would have encouraged the Consortium to schedule further drilling beyond January 2008. But it did not do so.\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 28.\n\nE-387, Consortium's Budget Committee Meeting Presentation, 26-27 September 2007, pp. 55-68.\n\n242.\n\nSecond, Perenco disregarded the fact that it was not only a matter of some disappointing results, but of the location of the disappointing wells in question. RPS referred in this respect to the \"poor results of the first 18 wells drilled in Oso field, particularly the results of the four failed Main Holl\u00edn wells.\"236 These 4 wells, which were probing for the edges237, indicated limited potential to the north, south, east, and southwest of the Oso field. As a result, Oso 21 and 23 were drilled in an apparent effort to test the northwest extension of the reservoir. As explained by RPS, the mixed results that these wells yielded, coupled with the looming contract expiry in 2010 and the poor quality of the seismic data in the western flank, would have persuaded the Consortium to limit additional drilling to three infill wells (Oso 24, 25 and 26), *i.e.*, between Oso 21 and 23, and wells drilled of the main northern drilling pad (Oso 9). Once Petroamazonas took over operations, it benefited from new seismic data which allowed it to further step-out drilling to the north and to the west.238\n\nRPS' Direct Presentation, Slide 31; RPS ER V, paragraphs 74-75 and Appendix B.\n\nTr.

Under Case 2246, RPS forecasted 289,200 barrels of 1P247 and 2P248 oil from the existing wells in Block 7249, a figure undisputed by Perenco.\n\n*Ibid.,* Section 2.2\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 95.\n\nAs explained by RPS in its Fourth Expert Report, fn. 35: An AFE, sometimes referred to as an Authorization for Financial Expenditure, is a document which itemizes the costs associated with projects requiring significant expenditures. The AFE is typically presented to management for approval before the work can commence. Economic justification for the expenditure is usually part of the \"AFE package.\" For new wells, the justification will include, among other items, production forecasts for the life of the well, sometimes referred to as the AFE production prognosis.\n\nExisting wells (includes wells drilled \"but for Decree 662\") as of 20 July 2010 through contract expiration on 16 August 2010; Forecast then adjusted by subtracting production attributable to wells drilled \"but for Decree 662\" \u2013 See RPS ER IV, Table 2.\n\n1P (proved).\n\n2P (proved plus probable).\n\nRPS ER IV, Tables 8 and 9; RPS ER V, Appendix U.\n\n246.\n\nEcuador and RPS criticised Mr. Crick's type-curve forecasting methodology (because he first determined the initial oil rate for his new wells, before applying to these (and to the existing) wells a type curve calculated at field level). This could be very imprecise, differing from reality by as much as 45%, as Mr. Crick himself acknowledged.250\n\nTr. Q. (3) 655-657:13 (Crick).\n\n247.\n\nMr. Crick's production figures were also grossly inflated as compared to the actual production of the Blocks. Mr. Crick's forecasting methodology not only failed to accurately forecast the past, but RPS also demonstrated that the results obtained by applying Mr. Crick's decline curve to each of the existing Oso wells from their initial production through to 31 March 2013 significantly exceeded (*i.e.* inflated) the actual production of the very wells for which Mr. Crick claimed to have obtained an excellent match. RPS undertook an independent check of Crick's forecasts and provided an apples-to-apples comparison with actual production, which resulted in an overstatement of reserves of Oso of 21 MMbo.251\n\nRPS' Direct Presentation, Slide 42.\n\n248.\n\nRPS demonstrated that in order to achieve the claimed \"excellent match\" between his forecast and the actual production of the Perenco wells, Mr. Crick had adjusted the data, thereby discrediting his validation technique.252 For the new wells, Dr. Strickland did not validate Mr. Crick's forecast for those wells, which represented some 99 MMbo out of his total forecast of 122.5 MMbo253. RPS also showed that Petroamazonas (unlike Perenco) had the capacity to handle a significant number of new wells and water production \u2013 beyond that of the 56 wells in Mr. Crick's analysis \u2013 with no operational restriction.254 Therefore, contrary to what Perenco alleged,255 the divergence between Mr. Crick's forecast and actual production could not be attributed to Petroamazonas' operational policies, but only to his flawed methodology.256\n\n*Ibid.,* Slides 32-39.\n\nTr.

(4) 1188:11-1189:2 (RPS); RPS' Direct Presentation, Slide 42.\n\n*(iii)Perenco's response*\n-------------------------\n\n249.\n\nIn response to Ecuador's and RPS' arguments, Perenco argued that RPS had wrongly criticised Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland for employing \"aggregate\" forecasting methods derived from group of wells. Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland had explained in detail why aggregate methods were better suited to the individually unpredictable Block 7 wells than well-by-well forecasts.257 Petroamazonas' own reserves evaluator, Ryder Scott, had used type curves in its forecasting for these Blocks, just as Mr. Crick had. Mr. Crick's method produced an excellent match to actual production from the wells it was designed to predict.\n\nCrick WS III, paragraphs 14-27; Strickland ER II, Section II.\n\n250.\n\nDespite the earlier criticisms, RPS was forced to admit on cross-examination that Mr. Crick's methods in fact produced more accurate results (2%) than RPS' own results (8%).258 RPS' only criticism was that Mr. Crick should have begun his forecast not in August 2009, but rather at the very beginning of each well's productive life.259 In other words, the method's \"good match\" \u2014its proven reliability in forecasting the future\u2014 should be disregarded because it fails to accurately forecast the *past*. Yet as RPS readily agreed, the point of '*decline-curve analysis*' is \"to predict the future.\"260 RPS had itself not provided a forecast that ran from the start of production of every well; rather, much like Mr. Crick, RPS has chosen a particular point in history (in RPS' case, October 2007) as the start of its forecast and then generated a prediction from that point forward.\n\nTr. Q. (4) 1179:20-1180:7 (RPS).\n\n*See* Tr. Q. (4) 1173:20-1174:5 (RPS).\n\nTr. Q. (4) 1175:17-1176:2 (RPS).\n\n251.\n\nRPS did not deny that Dr. Strickland's independent forecast for the existing Block 7 wells, which coincided closely with Mr. Crick's numbers, were reliable and accurate.\n\n*(iv) The Tribunal's decision*\n------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is a given that the Consortium's thinking would have been dominated by the looming contract expiry. The Tribunal believes that the sharply rising price of oil leading up to October 2007 would have induced Perenco to seek to drill as many wells as were economically possible in the Oso field in the time remaining in that Contract. According to Mr. Crick, in the absence of a contract extension, Perenco would have stopped drilling in Block 7 in August of 2009 in order to ensure an adequate payback on the new wells.261 Mr. Crick estimates that Perenco could have drilled 24 wells per year in Block 7. The Tribunal agrees and accepts Mr. Crick's production profiles.\n\nCrick WS II, paragraph 147; Tr. Q. (3) 627:10-22 (Crick).\n\n253.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that in the 'but for' scenario commencing October 2007, to the extent that it would have engaged in new drilling, Perenco would have concentrated on the more predictable and technically less challenging Oso field rather than the riskier and more expensive waterflooding that Mr. Crick proposed for the Lobo and Coca-Payamino fields. It notes that Mr. Crick himself stated in his second Witness Statement that: \"Lobo is one of the two fields, the other being the Coca-Payamino Unified Field, where, *in the event of an extension to the Block 7 contract*, Perenco was prepared to invest in further development using water injection.\"262 The Tribunal takes from this statement that drilling in the Coca-Payamino Unified Field would not have occurred unless a contract extension was granted and, in any event, the statement accords with the Tribunal's own sense of the evidence overall.\n\nCrick WS II, paragraph 203. [Emphasis added.]\n\n254.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal believes that the drilling that would have occurred in Block 7 'but for' Decree 662 would more likely have taken place in the Oso field only.\n\n*(v) Conclusion on the estimation of how many Block 7 wells would have been drilled up to August 2009*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Consortium would have drilled four wells by January 2008 and 19 wells from February 2008 to August 2009. It has therefore used this number and timing of wells in its estimate of the damages suffered by Perenco up to the date of the expropriation.\n\n*(c) Block 21 'but for' drilling programme up to caducidad*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nAs noted above, the valuation of this Block is a two-step process. The first step is to value the future cash flows resulting from Decree 662 as of 4 October 2007 (calculated on the assumed basis that the Contract would operate until their date of expiry). The second step requires an estimation of lost future cash flows performed as of 20 July 2010 for Block 21, 20 July 2010 being the date of the declaration of *caducidad* which took away the remaining lifespan of the Participation Contract.\n\n257.\n\nAs discussed previously, the second estimate is performed on a \"clean sheet\" basis. That is, instead of considering Decree 662's \"price-depressing\" effect on the value of the assets through to the date of the Contract's expiry, to use Perenco's words, the initial estimated lost cash flows for Block 21 will be cut off as of the date of the second valuation, and damages awarded for that period, whereupon a fresh valuation will be performed based on the conditions prevailing in the market as of the day before the declaration of *caducidad* was issued, and a second award of damages will be made for the loss of the Contract's remaining life, based upon the market conditions and the operator's assumed expectations in the 'but for' world of July 2010.\n\n*(i) Perenco's Position*\n------------------------\n\n258.\n\nPerenco points out that at the time of Decree 662's implementation in October 2007, it was only one-third of the way through its Block 21 operatorship, with nearly 14 years left before the Contract's expiry in June 2021. Mr. Crick's 'but for' development programme therefore addressed this lengthy period of time left in the Contract's life. Of the 24 wells estimated, 21 would be infill wells drilled in the central, developed part of the Yuralpa field containing an oil column of at least 90 feet, and the remaining three wells would be located outside of this area.263 In Mr. Crick's opinion, infill wells would have been recommended because of the water coning mechanism. Perenco noted that Ecuador's experts, RPS, accepted that infill drilling would indeed lead to new reserves. Half of RPS' own proposed wells were clearly infill.264\n\nMr. Crick assumes it will begin in January 2008, instead of July 2008 as proposed in the September 2007 BCM, absent Ecuador's coercive conduct, earlier in particular given the rise in oil prices at that time. The difference in date only causes an overall reduction of 2% in Mr. Crick's numbers. Mr. Crick has provided revised profiles that use the July 2008 start date for new Yuralpa drilling. This adds a layer of conservatism to Mr. Crick's production forecast. Professor Kalt has in turn used Mr. Crick's revised profiles in his updated damages calculation.\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 75; Crick WS III, paragraphs 88 \u2013 90 and Figure 9.\n\n259.\n\nPerenco pointed that in contrast to Mr. Crick's approach, RPS, who had previously claimed in the *Burlington* case that \"additional drilling was not justified in Yuralpa field at all because the field was fully developed [in 2007]\"265, had changed its mind in the present proceeding and it now proposed a limited six-well programme.266 Perenco noted that even its minimum investment commitment included in its 2008 negotiations with Ecuador *after* Decree 662 was promulgated, which contemplated operations on much less favourable economic terms than those contained in the Participation Contract, included seven Yuralpa wells.267\n\nCE-335, paragraph 144.\n\nRPS ER IV, paragraph 167.\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 69.\n\n260.\n\nDr. Strickland evaluated Mr. Crick's forecast as well as RPS's forecasted performance of the six new Yuralpa wells that it opined would have been drilled. He concluded that both programmes were attainable and the question was which was more reasonable. In his opinion, Mr. Crick's development plan was more reasonable in terms of the volumes forecasted and more reflective of what a prudent operator seeking to maximise its production would do, while RPS failed to explain why a prudent operator would cease drilling after six successful wells in such a large field.268\n\nStrickland ER II, paragraph 46.\n\n261.\n\nDr. Strickland had opined that the critical characteristics of the Main Holl\u00edn reservoir affecting its ability to produce oil were:269\n\n1. Amount of Oil : There was a large amount of oil in place in the Main Holl\u00edn. Since only a low percentage had been recovered to date, the ultimate recovery was likely to be even greater than Mr. Crick predicted. In Dr. Strickland's opinion, if oil prices were high enough, even more oil could be recovered than that forecasted by Mr. Crick.\n\n2. Geology and Depositional Environment : In the Yuralpa field, the vast majority of the oil was found in the upper level of the Main Holl\u00edn reservoir, which consists of braided stream channels. The braided stream channels of the Main Holl\u00edn had a porosity of 20-25%, which was considered excellent for oil recovery. The braided stream channels also had high permeability. Porosity and permeability were two critical characteristics because they dictate whether oil was capable of moving through the reservoir to the well bore.\n\n3. Water Drive : Yuralpa was a \"bottom water drive reservoir.\" As oil was produced, water replenishes the reservoir pores, resulting in a relatively constant pressure of 3,300 psi. The amount of water produced from a well in a water drive reservoir would increase over time as the invading water reached the well. Typically, the recovery of oil-in-place in water drive reservoirs was high.\n\n4. Viscous Oil : The oil in the Main Holl\u00edn was relatively heavy and viscous, which made it easy for the underlying water from the aquifer to break through the oil if pulled upward towards the low-pressure area around well perforations. This would lead to the creation of \"water cones.\"\n\n5. Presence of Shales : Shales, which are a type of low permeability, non-productive rock that impede the movement of fluids, were randomly distributed throughout the Main Holl\u00edn. The logs from the Main Holl\u00edn confirmed the presence of shales in a number of well bores in Yuralpa and Oso. However, the location and extent of shales could not be accurately predicted in the area between wells based on information from existing wells.\n\nStrickland ER I, paragraph 15.\n\n262.\n\nPerenco argued further that RPS wrongly rested its entire development plan for Block 21 on a proposal made at a single Consortium Budget Committee Meeting (BCM) held in September 2007. It was unreasonable to assume that the Consortium would have proposed and approved a full development plan for the 14 years remaining on the Block 21 Contract. Further, RPS' six proposed wells would produce more than one million barrels each. With such productive wells forecasted, it was irrational to assume that the operator would be content to take no further action in the ensuing years.\n\n263.\n\nThe Quantum Hearing testimony made clear that Perenco's 'but for' infill wells in Yuralpa would produce new reserves. As Dr. Strickland demonstrated in his presentation, RPS' own model disproved RPS' longstanding denial of water coning and its contention that \"there are no areas available that would be a good target for infill drilling.\"270 In fact, the case for infill wells was even better than what RPS's model had showed: correcting RPS's apparent error in its modeling and using the appropriate 40-acre spacing between existing wells, the simulated infill wells produce even more oil.271\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 41 referring to RPS ER V, App O, paragraph 27. Tr. Q. (4) 1027:13-14 (Strickland); Strickland Presentation at 9-23; see Strickland Model Displays submitted 15 December 2015.\n\nTr. Q. (4) 1042:19-1043:20 (Strickland). The Tribunal observes that Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland both proposed 40 acres in the expert reports; however, Dr. Strickland talked about 50 acres during his direct presentation (working off of RPS' model) and also reproduced RPS' 70-acre spacing. He opined that more oil would be produced from the 70-acre spacing: Tr. Q. (4) 1043:4-8: \"If you want 70-acres, then 70-acres per well is a square that's 1746 feet per side. Well, that's a bigger spacing. If you want a bigger spacing, that's going to be more oil in place, that's going to increase recovery, delay the water breakthrough.\"\n\n264.\n\nHence, Perenco argued that Dr. Gorell's \"puzzling refusal\" to call a \"conical shape\" a \"cone\" notwithstanding272, there was no longer any question that infill drilling between the existing wells' water cones would be productive. In fact, RPS explicitly \"agreed[d] that you will produce oil [from the infill wells].\"273 The only remaining debate concerned not oil production, but the associated water production274, with RPS claiming for the first time in its report filed with the Rejoinder that the water production associated with Mr. Crick's wells would substantially exceed the 120,000 barrels of water per day (bwpd) limit imposed by Mr. Crick.275\n\nTr.

(4) 1113:4-1115:2(RPS); RPS ER V, paragraphs 205-211.\n\n265.\n\nPrior to the Quantum Hearing, Perenco had criticised RPS for failing to run the Yuralpa simulation model, which it used to generate its Yuralpa forecasts, in a reasonable way.276 For example, RPS did not assume the behavior of a rational operator who would have allowed the field's fluid offtake rate (the amount of fluid produced through operations) to increase over time.277 RPS's own results indicated that even a modest increase in fieldwide water production significantly increased oil production.278 RPS nevertheless chose to keep fluid offtake levels low, with no explanation as to why Perenco would behave so irrationally.279\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraphs 103-104.\n\nCrick WS III, paragraphs 56-63.\n\nSee RPS ER IV, Appendix E, Tables 2-3 and 5-6; Crick WS III, paragraphs 57-59.\n\nCrick WS III, paragraphs 60, 108.\n\n266.\n\nAs Mr. Crick explained, in a water-drive reservoir such as the Yuralpa Holl\u00edn, where a powerful aquifer underlies all the oil and could be expected to encroach into the wells, increasing water-handling capacity was required to maximise the fields' productivity.280 Put simply, to produce greater volumes of oil, the operator must be prepared to produce and handle ever-greater volumes of water. As RPS was aware, Mr. Crick used a field-wide limit of 120,000 barrels per day.281 Yet RPS said nothing about Mr. Crick's proposed limit and provided no explanation for its decision to restrain its own forecast with much lower limits. In fact, Mr. Crick demonstrated that based on the latest data, his initial water estimate was actually pessimistic and the water production from his proposed new wells would be entirely manageable.282 RPS' only technical objection (that the water production associated with Mr. Crick's wells would substantially exceed the 120,000 barrels of water per day limit imposed by Mr. Crick) was thus invalid. Hence, RPS' only technical reason for opposing Mr. Crick's Yuralpa development plan is invalid.\n\nCrick WS III, paragraphs 56, 63; Crick WS II, paragraphs 47-55, 77-81, 166, 197-200; see Strickland ER II, paragraph 36.\n\nCrick WS III, paragraph 61.\n\nTr.

Dr. Strickland showed that this is what RPS did. The flaw in that approach was that the model contained no water-blocking shales beneath the simulated infill wells (it was therefore a 'worst case' scenario). Such a model would obviously forecast abundant water production, when in reality the presence of shales would substantially *reduce* water production. Dr. Strickland explained that full field models in a bottom waterdrive reservoir where there are shales that block water production is not a good forecasting tool.283 Actual data proves that the model is empirically wrong: it predicts a much higher water-oil ratio (WOR) than has been actually observed in the field.284\n\nTr. Q. (4) 1048:16-22 (Strickland); see also Tr. Q. (4) 1064:21-1065:11 (Strickland) (discussing water production in RPS's four-well model from its Fifth Report).\n\nTr. Q. (3) 641:18-642:21 (Crick); Crick's Direct Presentation, Slide 26; Tr. Q. (4) 1049:14-19 (Strickland).\n\n268.\n\nPerenco also contended that RPS misused a graph displaying Yuralpa's WOR as a function of cumulative production. RPS made a water production forecast for both existing and new wells using a WOR graph that records the behavior of existing Yuralpa wells only.285 This made no sense, in that it assumed that the new wells would add no reserves, which is indisputably false.\n\nTr. Q. (4) 1113:7-1115:2 (RPS); RPS' Direct Presentation, Slide 19; RPS ER V, paragraph 210, Figure 2.\n\n269.\n\nFinally, in addition to the vindication of Mr. Crick's Yuralpa development plan as a technical matter, the evidence also disproved Ecuador's contention that the outlook in Yuralpa was so \"bleak\" and \"disappointing\" that Perenco would simply have given up on the field.286 To the contrary, somewhat lower than expected per-well recoveries compelled Perenco to drill more wells, even marginally profitable ones, in order to recover this investment.287 The wells were still turning a profit, and as Mr. Caldwell of Brattle conceded, if Perenco had a reason to drill even marginal wells, there is no economic reason not to do just that.288 Hence, the 2007 Yuralpa Study's six new wells can only be a minimum, not a maximum \u2014a plan for the next set of work, not the full set of work.289 The 2007 Study itself discusses \"new infill wells\" and lists further analysis to be completed in support of such wells.290\n\nSee *e.g.* Tr.

(5) 1582:15-1583:14 (Brattle).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nCrick WS II, Appendix E, p. 3\n\n270.\n\nDr. Strickland also reviewed Mr. Crick's forecasted production volumes, pursuant to his drilling plan, against a series of tests as well as the actual drilling plans executed by Petroamazonas. He also considered the critical characteristics of the Main Holl\u00edn affecting its ability to produce oil as set out at paragraph 261 above.291 Mr. Crick forecasted that the existing wells would recover 52.1 MMStb292 of oil and the new forecasted wells 11.3 MMStb.293\n\nStrickland ER I, paragraph 15.\n\nCrick WS II, paragraph 121, noted that that the production from existing wells in Block 21 drilled until January 2008 was 20.19 million barrels. The additional production from the original Perenco wells between that date and contract end in June 2021 would be influenced by the new wells, estimated at 31.84 million barrels, giving a total recovery from the original Perenco wells of 52.03 million (20.19 from 2004 to January 2008 + 31.84 from February 2008 to June 2021).\n\nCrick WS III, Figure 1.\n\n271.\n\nDr. Strickland noted that the presence of water coning, and the effects of good water-blocking shales, had been documented in Yuralpa.294 Due to the unpredictability of the location and extent of shales, it was difficult to extrapolate individual well performance in the Main Holl\u00edn so as to predict reservoir production with reasonable confidence since great differences existed between wells; however, it was easier to determine what the next group of wells would likely produce.295\n\nStrickland ER I, paragraph 30.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 34.\n\n272.\n\nDr. Strickland also confirmed that additional oil between wells could be recovered by infill drilling, *i.e.* placement of new wells, as suggested by Mr. Crick in his development plan for Yuralpa.296 Such additional wells would be needed if the operator was to capture the significant amounts of oil remaining in the Yuralpa field.297\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 35-36.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 37.\n\n273.\n\nDr. Strickland tested Mr. Crick's forecasts using four types of '*production performance analysis* '/ '*decline curve analysis* ':\n\n1. Rate *vs* Time\n\n2. Type Curve\n\n3. Rate *vs* Cumulative\n\n4. Water to Oil Ratio *vs* Cumulative298\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 42. Dr. Strickland explained that this technique plots the water-to-oil ratio (\"WOR\") on the y-axis against the cumulative oil production on the x-axis. This type of plot is useful for wells that produce a great deal of water as compared to oil, as is the case with the wells producing from the Main Hollin. Only focusing on oil rates may give a pessimistic estimate of reserves in such circumstances. The common economic cut-off is a WOR of 49, meaning that 49 barrels of water are produced with each barrel of oil. A WOR of 49 is equivalent to a 98% water cut.\n\n274.\n\nHe found that Mr. Crick's application of the type-curve analysis was consistent with industry methods of forecasting future production for fields where individual wells were not well-behaved (*i.e.*, where the plotted production data for each do not follow a predictable trend).299 He confirmed that the data from these wells were not well-behaved on a well-by-well basis.300 However, the data was well-behaved on a group or field-wide prediction basis. Dr. Strickland applied the four techniques to a field-wide analysis of all wells as of August 2009 and then to each group of wells according to the year that they were drilled. Comparing Mr. Crick's calculation to his independently calculated estimates, Dr. Strickland found that Mr. Crick's calculations fell within his independent calculations and therefore he was confident that Mr. Crick reasonably and validly calculated the reserves and EUR of existing wells in the Yuralpa field.301\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 49; he explains definition of well-behaved wells at paragraph 44.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 50.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 51.\n\n275.\n\nFor the new wells that Mr. Crick forecasted in Block 21, Dr. Strickland applied a different methodology because historical information did not exist. He found Mr. Crick's forecasting approach to be consistent with industry practice.302 On the basis that wells drilled later in time would have lower initial rates and per-well EURs, Dr. Strickland plotted the average per-well EUR for the same group of wells and found a well-behaved trend, providing a prediction of the average per-well EUR for the next group of wells drilled in Yuralpa.303 He confirmed that Mr. Crick's forecasts were reasonable, and likely conservative.304 Dr. Strickland's numbers were:305\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Block 21 Yuralpa****Existing Wells Forecast Expected Ultimate Recovery (MMStb)** |\n| **Well Group** | **Wells****Included** | **Forecast Method** |\n| **Rate Time****MMStb** | **Rate Cum****MMStb** | **WOR Cum****MMStb** | **Type Curve MMStb** | Average of 4 Methods |\n| **1** | **Drill 2004** | **12.5** | **12.4** | **13.3** | **14.5** |  |\n| **2** | **Drill 2005** | **20.2** | **20.0** | **23.7** | **23.2** |  |\n| **3** | **Drill 2006-7** | **15.7** | **15.6** | **18.3** | **18.3** |  |\n|  | **Sum of Groups 1,2 & 3** | **48.4** | **46.0** | **55.3** | **56.0** | **51.9** |\n| **4** | **All Perenco Operated** | **47.9** | **48.0** | **62.6** | **53.3** | **53.0** |\n|  |\n| **Analysis of John Crick** |  |  |  |  | **52.1** |  |\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 68.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 68-69.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 71.\n\nStrickland ER II, paragraph 41.\n\n276.\n\nUsing Perenco's history-matched numerical model, developed in 2007 and later updated,306 Dr. Strickland confirmed that there was enough oil remaining in un-swept locations to drill the 24 wells forecasted by Mr. Crick.307\n\nStrickland Reference 5.\n\nStrickland ER I, paragraph 76.\n\n277.\n\nAlthough Mr. Crick's correlation was acknowledged to be imperfect308, Perenco contended that Mr. Crick's correlation was a useful and conservative basis for forecasting the new wells' production. Decline curve analysis was a reliable forecasting tool where, as here, there is every reason to believe that Perenco would continue to undertake the necessary work and investments \u2013 just as Petroamazonas has in fact done.309 Although RPS had argued in its Fifth Report that Mr. Crick used an improper averaging technique in creating his type curves, Mr. Crick argued that this was not true and RPS made no attempt to revive this point.310\n\nTr.

(3) 637:9-15 (Crick).\n\n278.\n\nPerenco asserted further that RPS argued for adoption of a 17% decline rate sourced from Petroamazonas' Block 21 contract with YPF that RPS had itself explicitly rejected in the *Burlington* proceeding. Having conceded that this rate ought never to have been used, RPS attempted to reach the same steep decline rate by extrapolating the field's decline over a period that included the negative impact of Decree 662.311 On cross-examination, Dr. Gorell agreed that any extrapolation should be sensitive to the import of historical events.312\n\nCl.

(4) 1209:11-1212:8 (RPS).\n\n279.\n\nPerenco submitted further that Mr. Crick's forecasts have been verified by other independent sources, including later estimates from Petroamazonas, Ryder Scott and Dr. Strickland. RPS on the other hand offered no criticism at all of Dr. Strickland's Yuralpa predictions and Ecuador did not cross-examine Dr. Strickland on his forecasting methods or results.313\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 53.\n\n280.\n\nBased on Mr. Crick's technical work, as reviewed by Dr. Strickland, Professor Kalt then estimated the value of Block 21 foregone by Perenco as a result of Ecuador's Treaty and contractual breaches. He calculated that Perenco's damages arising from Block 21 suffered as a result of the breaches amounted to $501.5 million if valued on an *ex ante* basis314 and $651.6 million, if valued on an *ex post* basis.315\n\nKalt ER IV, Exhibit JK-64, PSC Extension 2010 scenario.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*(ii) Ecuador's Position*\n-------------------------\n\n281.\n\nIn Ecuador's view, the Consortium would have only drilled up to six, not 24, new wells at Yuralpa.\n\n282.\n\nEcuador observed that it was not in dispute that the Yuralpa field was Perenco's first greenfield project and that its development was strewn with unforeseen challenges and unexpectedly poor results. As admitted by Mr. Combe, following the sudden and inexplicable loss of its two best producers in 2004, the field never again met the Consortium's 20,000 barrels of oil per day 'ship-or-pay' commitment316, notwithstanding investments substantially higher than originally expected.317 Subsequent consecutive drilling campaigns also yielded disappointing results.\n\nTr.

The preliminary results of this study were presented at the September 2007 BCM. This and a slightly refined and final version of the Yuralpa Simulation Study issued by Perenco in June 2008 identified two unswept areas in which the existing wells alone would not have drained the reservoir by 2021. As a result, the September 2007 BCM presentation set out a preliminary programme of between six and eight new wells in the main and south-eastern fringe areas of the field, to be drilled starting in July 2008. This was later reduced to between five and seven wells in the subsequent Simulation Study, in order to effectively sweep the reservoir.318\n\nCrick WS II, Appendix E, Yuralpa Field Study, pp. 2, 32, 34.\n\n284.\n\nAccordingly, RPS concluded that six new wells would have been drilled at Yuralpa from July 2008 onwards but for Decree 662: two in the main area of the field, three in the south-eastern fringe and one re-drill towards the south.319 Ecuador rejected the contention that RPS had shifted positions between the *Burlington* and *Perenco* arbitrations; the two tribunals had made different findings and hence different perspectives needed to be adopted as a result.320\n\nCrick WS II, Appendix E, Yuralpa Field Study, Figure 161; see also Tr. Q. (4) 1097:21-1098:2 (RPS).\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 67; RPS ER V, Section 2.4; RPS ER V, Section 2.4.\n\n285.\n\nPerenco's purported 24-well drilling programme, which would have commenced in July 2008, was at odds with Perenco's September 2007 BCM presentation and the Yuralpa Simulation Study issued in June 2008, which contemplated drilling between five and (no more than) seven horizontal wells so as to effectively sweep the two areas which would have been otherwise left undrained by 2021.\n\n286.\n\nNeither the Yuralpa Simulation Study nor any contemporaneous document implied, let alone demonstrated, that there was any significant issue with respect to how Perenco's Geoscience department carried out the Study or constructed its state-of-the-art model. Nor were the conclusions and recommendations criticised or in any way impugned prior to Mr. Crick's testimony. The Study simply did not envisage the need for, or indeed identify the benefit of, proceeding with an extensive infill drilling campaign in the main area of the Yuralpa field and instead focused on further development of the fringe area, where the oil column thickness was inferior to 90 feet.321\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 69.\n\n287.\n\nYet, Mr. Crick's evidence was that the Consortium would have set aside the conclusions and recommendations from this in-depth study and instead embark upon a spur-of-the-moment 24 vertical well campaign, commencing with 21 infill wells in the main area of the field. Mr. Crick's justification was because he wanted to do vertical wells.322\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 68; Tr. Q. (3) 623:9-18 (Crick).\n\n288.\n\nMr. Crick's extensive infill drilling programme was premised on the assumption that water coning was a pervasive occurrence at Yuralpa.323 In Ecuador's view, this was not supported by any document on the record and infill drilling was inconsistent with the recommendations of the Yuralpa Study. RPS demonstrated that, consistent with the Kerr McGee report324, water movement was actually far more complex in the Main Holl\u00edn reservoir. As shown in RPS's 4-well sample simulations, each well drilled gave rise to extensive lateral water movement, which extended outward with time and, by interacting with the water movement caused by neighbouring wells, eliminated any \"infill\" drilling targets.\n\nTr. Q. (3) 634:19-635:2 (Crick).\n\nCrick WS III, Appendix G, p. 15.\n\n289.\n\nNeither Mr. Crick nor Dr. Strickland levied any material criticism against RPS' simulation runs or their ultimate conclusion. Dr. Strickland did not outright reject the notion of extensive lateral water movement. Instead, he sought to downplay its impact by purporting to show that even in RPS' 4-well water encroachment model, enough oil remained trapped between wells so as to warrant drilling the fifth \"infill\" well. This failed for two reasons:\n\n1. Dr. Strickland focused on representations of the 4-well sample at 12, 19 and 25 months into production. However, this overlooked the fact that the actual Yuralpa wells were much older than that. On average, the wells drilled in this area would have been producing between 33 months and 57 months between the commencement and end of Mr. Crick's drilling campaign. These wells would have caused far more extensive water encroachment and left far less recoverable oil between them.\n\n2. The recovery of any such incremental oil, would be accompanied by the production of large amounts of water.325 The aggregate water production of 24 such wells would very rapidly surpass the handling capacity of 45,000 bwpd of the field in 2008, thus requiring substantial investment towards an upgrade. Dr. Strickland did not seek to quantify the associated water production.326\n\nTr. Q. (4) 1104:3-1105:4 (RPS).\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraph 100.\n\n290.\n\nMr. Crick's development plan and his own run of the Yuralpa model would yield far more water than his assumed upgraded handling capacity of 120,000 bwpd. In particular, according to Mr. Crick's development plan, the water production was expected to increase steadily up to 180,000 bwpd in 2021. As a remedy to such increase, Mr. Crick provided for three water shutoff workovers (WSOs) to be carried out per year, starting in 2015. However, as shown by RPS, such WSOs could not achieve the massive reduction in water production that they were credited with.327 In addition, Mr. Crick's own run of the Yuralpa model also yielded water production figures far higher than his stated 120,000 bwpd, which he then sought to cap through over 100 automatic WSOs. As demonstrated by RPS and conceded by Mr. Crick, however, such operations were unrealistic and costly.\n\nRPS ER V, paragraphs 213-216.\n\n291.\n\nRPS also took issue with Mr. Crick's observation that the simulator over-predicted water production. This was true so long as the field operations remained unchanged, but it was not a valid assumption to make if 24 new wells were put into production in the reservoir and the way in which the wells were operated was significantly changed. This meant that a reasonable proportional cutback of liquid production would inevitably require a significant reduction in the total amount of oil produced, something which was ignored by Mr. Crick.328 Moreover, in response to Perenco's argument that since \"the model contains no water-blocking shales beneath the simulated infill wells\" RPS was using a \"worst-case scenario\" forecasting tool329, it is not possible to accurately predict the location of shales.330 This meant that Mr. Crick's 24 new wells were just as likely *not* to encounter shales as they were drilled. Even if the shales could be accounted for prior to any drilling, it was not true that they would have an effect on cumulative water production. Ecuador asserted that such shales would, at best, laterally deviate the otherwise vertical course of water,331 which would increase the amount of mobile water in the field and consequently the amount of water produced by another well.332\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 208.\n\nCl.

(3) 635:8-11 (Crick).\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 71.\n\n292.\n\nRPS further asserted that in addition to not imposing a field wide limit on the total water production, Mr. Crick also changed how the simulation controls the wells by simultaneously changing well minimum production rates and workover procedures, \"all in manners which tend to increase oil production.\"333 RPS found these to be \"outrageously optimistic.\"334\n\nRPS ER V, paragraph 209.\n\n*Id*.\n\n293.\n\nEcuador also criticised Mr. Crick's type-curve forecasting methodology335 asserting that it can be very imprecise, differing from reality by as much as 45%, as acknowledged by Mr. Crick.336 The initial rate of the wells was incorrectly determined; Mr. Crick purported to derive this rate from an alleged correction between the actual initial rates of 27 Perenco wells and 11 wells drilled by Petroamazonas, but Mr. Crick conceded at the Quantum Hearing that this was not a reliable correction337: its 0.25 coefficient was far below the 0.6 required to find a valid statistical correlation. Moreover, the well data Mr. Crick relied on to derive this \"non-correlation\" was selected in an inconsistent manner because he had chosen to exclude eight wells out of a total of 35 (23% of the available data) on the ground that he considered them to be \"outliers.\"338 As RPS pointed out, it is statistically unsound to exclude 23% of the data.339\n\nResp.

Such production would have been derived from both the existing wells (22.83 MMbo) and from the six new wells the Consortium would have drilled but for Decree 662 (6.81 MMbo).342 RPS' forecast was derived from the Yuralpa simulation model which represented the culmination of a major phase of geomodelling and simulation work carried out by Perenco's own geoscience department. This model was undoubtedly the best and most up-to-date prediction tool available to the Consortium from late 2007 onwards and is therefore, the most appropriate means of forecasting oil production in Block 21.343\n\nRPS ER IV, paragraph 150, Table 14.\n\nWhile Perenco sought to depict RPS' reliance on the 2010 updated version of this model as being inconsistent with its *ex ante* approach, the fact remains that RPS was not provided the June 2008 version of the model. The implications of RPS' use of the 2010 update would, in any event, appear to be inconsequential in light of Crick's own testimony that what happened in 2010 was a typical minor adjustment to the model and not a full update incorporating all of the knowledge available at the time. See Crick WS III, paragraphs 53-54.\n\n*(iii)The Tribunal's Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that for Block 21, Mr. Crick's plan was that all 24 of his Yuralpa field wells would be drilled in the period commencing January 2008 through to the end of 2009 (assuming two rigs operating, each one taking a month to drill a well344) and he projected no additional drilling from the end of 2009 through to contract expiry in 2021, a period of some 11 years. In his third witness statement, he adjusted his commencement date to July 2008.345 However, he still contemplated all 24 wells being drilled before the declaration of *caducidad* and none being drilled thereafter.\n\nCrick WS II, paragraph 256. Perenco employed such a programme starting in December 2004, where it drilled 28 wells until it halted drilling in order to conduct a field study. RPS ER V, paragraph 143.\n\nCrick WS III, paragraph 3.\n\n298.\n\nHis 'but for' drilling programme was thus 'front-end loaded'.\n\n299.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of documentary and oral evidence which showed that:\n\n(1) Block 21 consistently performed below expectations after its first three months of production in 2004.346\n\n(2) This led to Perenco's decision to halt drilling in February 2007, some seven months before Decree 662 came into effect.347\n\n(3) Burlington's parent, ConocoPhillips, produced a Latin America Reserves Review in May 2007 which noted that drilling in Yuralpa had been \"*currently halted to conduct field study (water production key issue)*\" and further that \"*disappointing well results in latter part of 2006 reduced development [drilling] opportunities* - Field study currently underway.\"348\n\n(4) The ConocoPhillips Information Memorandum (also of May 2007) stated that \"\u2026due to earlier than expected water breakthrough in the latest wells, further drilling has been put on hold pending the completion of a reservoir and completion practices study.\"349\n\n(5) Based on the preliminary study being performed by Perenco, ConocoPhillips at this point anticipated nine wells as \"potential targets\" (four infill and five offset (*i.e*., flank) locations, but by the September 2007 Budget Committee Meeting (BCM), the number was reduced to five to seven with fewer interior wells.350\n\n(6) Perenco informed the BCM of 26-27 September 2007 that there would be \"*no investment [in Block 21]\u2026 for first half of 2008.*\"351\n\n(7) Perenco's \"preliminary programme\" in September 2007 was that five to seven wells be drilled.\n\n(8) The final report on the field study was distributed only in June 2008, eight months after Decree 662 came into effect.352\n\n(9) It is conceded by RPS that the field study identified two unswept areas in Block 21 where oil which would not have been drained by the existing wells.353\n\nTr.

RPS contended that this shows that the Consortium saw this drilling programme as a \"last opportunity\" for success. See RPS ER V, paragraph 164.\n\nE-275, ConocoPhillips Information Memorandum.\n\nRPS ER IV, Appendix H, p. 164.\n\nE-387, Budget Committee Meeting Slides, Slide 164.\n\nRPS ER V, paragraph 161.\n\nRPS ER V, paragraph 54: \"In addition, in order to properly reflect the Consortium's perspective, RPS adopted the model developed by Mr. Crick's Perenco colleagues, as referenced by Perenco on 19 December 2014 in Dr. Strickland's First Report. RPS proceeded to use this model in a diligent and prudent manner to investigate the robustness of the Perenco simulation team's findings regarding the two potentially unswept areas of the Main Hollin reservoir in Yuralpa and its recommendation to drill 5 to 7 wells to exploit the opportunity to recover the volumes therein.\" [footnotes omitted.]\n\n300.\n\nThe real questions for the Tribunal are: (i) given the Yuralpa field's history, at what pace would drilling have occurred in the 'but for' world; and (ii) what would be the financial impact of the water handling required to exploit the wells in Yuralpa.\n\n301.\n\nRPS noted the following points about the Perenco simulation study:\n\n\"Base case reserves were 20.3 MMstb. They were calculated using the wells that existed as of October 2007, and using the fluid production rates at that time.  \nWater handling capacity was 45,000 barrels per day.  \nPerenco evaluated the potential to increase reserves to 25.7 MMstb by maintaining the current drawdown in the existing wells. This would necessitate increase in water handling to 60,000 barrels per day.\n\n[...]\n\nPerenco evaluated drilling between five and seven wells, which could increase reserves to 32.0 MMstb with the current liquid production rates in existing wells. [...]\"354\n\nRPS ER V, paragraph 151.\n\n302.\n\nBased on the evidence before it, the Tribunal considers that in the 'but for' period following 4 October 2007, the Consortium would have been, on the one hand, incentivised to drill by the rising oil prices experienced in the period leading up to October 2007. On the other hand, the Consortium would have been more conservative than Mr. Crick in committing to an ambitious drilling programme, given the hitherto disappointing performance of Block 21. That said, the general view must be that in the 'but for' world, particularly with a relatively long period of time remaining on the Contract and strong oil prices at the time, the Consortium would have drilled all wells that were technically and economically feasible.\n\n303.\n\nIn the circumstances, and given Mr. Crick's adjustment in timing, the Tribunal therefore considers that this programme would have commenced no earlier than July 2008.355\n\nTherefore, when estimating the Yuralpa field's value for the purposes of calculating the effect of Decree 662, there would be no increase in the number of Block 21 wells until mid-2008. As for what would happen thereafter, the Tribunal considers that it would be appropriate to assume that Perenco would have drilled six wells between Decree 662 and the declaration of *caducidad*.\n\nMr. Crick initially used a January 2008 start date but later adjusted it to July 2008 which reduced his predicted oil volumes by 2%. See Crick WS III, paragraph 3.\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the starting point for the analysis is a model based on the drilling programme as contemplated in 2008 (six wells) in the period leading up to *caducidad* and to adjust for an increased number of wells.\n\nE. **The impact of** ***caducidad*****'s termination of the balance of Perenco's contractual rights**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nThe declaration of *caducidad* terminated the Participation Contracts. This was done only one month before the Block 7 Participation Contract expired. As already noted, the Tribunal has declined to assume a particular contractual model that might have governed the Parties' relationship in relation to Block 7 and has chosen instead to treat this as a compensable loss of opportunity, addressed below.\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore begins by considering the situation in Block 21, which Perenco would have operated for some approximately 11 years had *caducidad* not been declared. This raises Mr. Crick's 'but for' drilling plan for the Yuralpa field.\n\n307.\n\nWith respect to the 11 remaining years on the Contract and prices prevailing in the period leading up to July 2010, had *caducidad* not been declared, given that there is exploitable oil in Block 21, the Tribunal considers that Perenco would have conducted further drilling, particularly when it is assumed as the Tribunal has decided to assume that as of October 2008, the Participation Contracts would be stabilised at 33%. In the end, the Tribunal has decided to employ a mid-range number of wells from Mr. Crick's scenario. In the Tribunal's view, having regard to industry practices and in particular the desirability of maximising Perenco's returns in Block 21 over a still lengthy period of time as well as the value of accelerating drilling in order to capture as much production as possible, but mindful of the Block's history of watering issues, Perenco would have drilled additional wells after expropriation.\n\n308.\n\nHaving arrived at this conclusion, the Tribunal is aware of the fact that the *Burlington* tribunal took a different view, namely, that having regard to the situation as of September 2007 before the enactment of Decree 662 only six wells were scheduled to be drilled. This was the number of wells that that tribunal found it was reasonable to assume would it be drilled in the circumstances. The present Tribunal cannot agree with *Burlington* 's heavy reliance on the September 2007 BCM Presentation and accepts Perenco's argument that \"budget committee presentations are not development plans and that Perenco had not intended, in the course of a single budget meeting in 2007, to lay out its plans for the 14 years remaining on the Block 21 Contract.\"356 The Tribunal believes that given the 14 year time horizon, the Consortium would have been likely to drill more wells so long as it considered that there was commercially exploitable oil.357\n\nSee Perenco's 18 April 2017 comments on the *Burlington* award, p. 4.\n\n*Burlington* award, paragraphs 425-426, 436, 449.\n\n309.\n\nKnowing that Petroamazonas has to some extent validated Mr. Crick's modeling of the Blocks' productive capacity is of some comfort to the Tribunal that it has arrived at a fair and reasonable valuation, but at the end of the day the Tribunal's approach is to: (i) use market conditions prevailing at the time of the taking; (ii) take the common sense commercial view that with 11 years remaining on Block 21's life, Perenco more likely than not would have sought to maximise its efforts to extract as much value from the Block as was reasonably attainable; (iii) Perenco's drilling programme would have been conducted somewhat more conservatively than Mr. Crick's plan, but still would have sought to overcome the Yuralpa field's technical challenges; and (iv) as Perenco gained more knowledge and experience with the field, it would have put that knowledge and experience to commercial benefit in its drilling decisions.\n\n310.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that 'but for' the declaration of *caducidad*, Perenco would have drilled ten wells (in addition to the six wells drilled before *caducidad*) between 2010 and 2020.\n\n311.\n\nHaving considered the record evidence and the arguments of the Parties, the Tribunal further concludes that the water production levels associated with a 16-well drilling programme would be 120,000 bwpd.358\n\nSee Section 0) below regarding CAPEX.\n\nF. **Valuation of Perenco's loss of opportunity to operate Block 7**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the valuation of the loss of opportunity to negotiate an agreement to continue to operate Block 7 until August 2018. As discussed above, this exercise differs from valuing the loss of profits expected under an executed contract and the question is how to value this opportunity.\n\n**1. Perenco's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n313.\n\nPerenco submitted (in the alternative to its asserted claim of US$626 million based on the AGIP contract, which the Tribunal has already rejected), Ecuador must pay damages for the value of Perenco's lost opportunity to obtain and benefit from a contract extension. Tribunals are willing to apply the loss of chance doctrine even when the probability is low. Here, Perenco established that an extension would very likely have been granted and at the very least should be compensated for its loss of chance to operate in Block 7 until 2018. Perenco's case was unlike that of the claimants in the *Gemplus* case, where the claimants based their extension claim solely on the ground that the concession gave rise to a legitimate expectation that significant additional revenue could be expected from the second 10-year period.359 Perenco had established a strong factual basis for the extension and this was not a claim for speculative and uncertain damages.\n\n*Gemplus. v. Mexico*.\n\n**2. Ecuador's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n314.\n\nIn contrast, Ecuador relied on the *Gemplus* award, where that tribunal looked at the language of a similarly drafted clause and concluded that, while the exercise of the State's discretion was not unfettered under municipal law, the claimant's claim for the second period of ten years was far too contingent, uncertain and unproven, lacking any sufficient factual basis for the assessment of compensation under the two applicable BITs. At the relevant date, the concessionaire had no legal right to any extension.360 Likewise, while Ecuador's discretion was not unfettered under Ecuadorian law, Perenco's claim for an eight-year extension was far too contingent, uncertain and unproven, lacking any sufficient factual basis for the assessment of compensation under the Treaty. At the date of *caducidad*, Perenco had no legal right to an extension.361\n\n*Gemplus v. Mexico.*, Award, paragraph 12-49.\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 15.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nThe Parties have argued over the relevance of the *Gemplus* award, where the concession contract at issue contained a clause that contemplated an extension of the initial 10-year term. The main reason why that tribunal refused the loss of opportunity claim based on the possible renewal of the contract stemmed from the fact that the circumstances which initially threw the motor vehicle registry project into disarray and forced the authorities to intervene to administer the concessionaire occurred at the very outset of the Concession's life.362 This caused an understandable decline in public confidence in the registry initiative.363 Hence, the tribunal had little difficulty rejecting that part of the claim.\n\nThe events in question centered on the arrest of the concessionaire's general manager, Ricardo Cavallo, for his alleged role in the Argentinian \"dirty war\", his detention in Mexico and subsequent extradition to Spain at the request of a Spanish investigating judge, and his further extradition to Argentina to face war crimes charges in that country. Mr. Cavallo's arrest was quickly followed by the death in murky circumstances of the senior government official, Dr. Ra\u00fal Ramos, responsible for the motor vehicle registry project.\n\n*Gemplus v. Mexico*, Award, paragraphs 13-96: \"As found by the Tribunal, [by the time of termination] the project was by then already severely damaged from earlier events for which the Respondent bears no liability under the BITs; and it remained subject to several commercial, legal and political risks. Moreover, it was the Respondent's own efforts in September 2000 that kept the project even half alive (as regards new vehicles) and not destroyed completely by the twin calamities of August/September 2000, namely the Cavallo incident and the death of Dr. Ramos. But for Dr. Blanco's efforts at the time (at the Secretariat), the Concessionaire would have failed in or soon after September 2000. Moreover this half-life project, by 24 June 2001, was far from the project originally envisaged with its business dependent on the registration of both new and used vehicles.\"\n\n316.\n\nHowever, although it was facing dramatically different factual circumstances than the present case, and it was then attempting to value a loss resulting from extant contractual rights, the *Gemplus* tribunal highlighted two points on 'loss of opportunity' that resonate with the present Tribunal. First, there was \"no certainty or realistic expectation of this project's profitability as originally envisaged, but there was nonetheless a reasonable opportunity\" and that \"opportunity, however small, has a monetary value\" at international law.364 Second, \"it would be wrong in principle to deprive or diminish the Claimants of the monetary value of that lost opportunity on lack of evidential grounds when that lack of evidence is directly attributable to the Respondent's own wrongs.\"365\n\n*Ibid*., paragraphs 13-98.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 13-99.\n\n317.\n\nThis is in line with the present Tribunal's view. The facts are that: (i) Block 7 was a proven field with valuable oil reserves; (ii) there is no question that even with a changed contractual model, Perenco wanted to stay in Ecuador and continue to operate the block; and (iii) there is considerable evidence that the State itself would have preferred Perenco to stay in Ecuador. The Tribunal believes that 'but for' the breaches, the parties more likely than not would have arrived at a solution whereby Perenco would be operating Block 7 under a different contractual regime. But the Tribunal has also found that it cannot engage in the kind of speculation about a specific contractual model which would then be married with Mr. Crick's projections in order to arrive at an amount of damages.\n\n318.\n\nPerenco referred the Tribunal to Ripinsky and Williams' Damages in International Investment Law, where the authors observed:\n\n\"Loss of chance can thus be used as a tool allowing the injured party to receive *some* form of compensation for the loss of chance to make profit. In theory, the loss of chance is assessed by reference to the degree of probability of the chance turning out in the plaintiff's favour, although in practice the amount awarded on this account is often discretionary.\"366\n\nCA-511, Ripinsky, Sergey & Williams, Kevin, *Damages in International Investment Law* (London: British Institute of International and Comparative Law, 2008), pp. 291-292.\n\n319.\n\nThe authors continue:\n\n\"In some other cases, arbitral tribunals have determined the amount of lost profits in a discretionary manner. Where this lack of numerical support was due to the fact that a tribunal could not estimate the loss of profits with satisfactory precision, such awards may be classified as compensation for the loss of business opportunity. Amounts awarded under this head of damage are likely to be conservative and reflect a tribunal's view of an equitable, reasonable and balanced outcome rather than being a result of a mathematical calculation.\"367\n\n*Ibid*., p. 293.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the claim here is not to be equated to a lost profits claim based upon a final, executed contract. There is an element of uncertainty that must be taken into consideration.\n\n321.\n\nIn arriving at its decision, the Tribunal has considered the ILC Articles, particularly Article 36 thereof, and the commentaries (specifically (27) and (32) thereto. Article 36 provides that:\n\n\"1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution.\n\n2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\"368\n\nILC Articles.\n\n322.\n\nThe key point is that financial damage must not only be proximately caused by the unlawful act(s), but that it also be \"*assessable*\", that is, capable of being assessed. The Tribunal has already observed that it is also alive to the cases' and commentaries' reminder that international courts, tribunals and claims commissions seek to avoid granting \"inherently speculative\" claims or to put it the other way, seek to determine whether there are \"sufficient attributes to be considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable.\"369\n\n*Ibid.,* Commentary (27) to Article 34. Particularly the concern expressed about the need to ensure that there is \"financially assessable\" damage: \"Tribunals have been reluctant to provide compensation for claims with inherently speculative elements. When compared with tangible assets, profits (and intangible assets which are income-based) are relatively vulnerable to commercial and political risks, and increasingly so the further into the future projections are made. In cases where lost future profits have been awarded, it has been where an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable. This has normally been achieved by virtue of contractual arrangements or, in some cases, a well-established history of dealings.\"\n\n323.\n\nThe circumstances of the present case are unusual. The parties arrived at an 'in principle' negotiated change to their contractual relationship which contemplated the extension of Block 7's term. However, it was Ecuador, and not Perenco, which, due to Burlington's recalcitrance, balked at its implementation. The Tribunal found this refusal was a breach of the Treaty by Ecuador which deprived Perenco of the chance to reach an agreement on extension.370 Therefore, the Tribunal considers that Perenco is entitled to compensation for the loss of that opportunity.\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraphs 622-624.\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal frankly acknowledges that any estimation of the value of the loss of opportunity is an exercise of discretion and therefore it has decided to award a nominal value. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls a comment made by the *Murphy v. Ecuador* tribunal with which the Tribunal agrees:\n\n\"\u2026The applicable international law standard of full reparation, as reflected in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* judgment and Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, does not determine the valuation methodology. Nor does the Treaty. Tribunals enjoy a large margin of appreciation in order to determine how an amount of money may \"as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"371\n\n*Murphy v. Ecuador,* paragraph 481.\n\n325.\n\nBecause it is a loss of opportunity to have the contract extended rather than the loss of a fully crystallised legal right to an extension of a contract, the expected cash flows of which could be modelled on a DCF basis, such value must necessarily be significantly lower than the amount claimed by Perenco based on the AGIP contract model applied by Mr. Crick's drilling forecasts for Block 7 through to 2018.\n\n326.\n\nIn all of the circumstances, the Tribunal holds that an award of US$25 million is appropriate. It cannot but note that the equities tend strongly in favour of the granting of this relief. This however is not a decision *ex aequo et bono*. It is one grounded in law.\n\nG. **Contributory Negligence**\n------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nEcuador's defences on liability and on quantum advanced various arguments to the effect that Perenco was either the author of its own misfortune or otherwise has contributed to the harm in respect of which it now seeks damages. This was prominent in Ecuador's argument during the liability phase that Perenco and Burlington pursued a so-called \"*self-expropriation*\" strategy in refusing to comply with Law 42 by paying sums into an offshore account, and calculating that they would be better off keeping that money and not operating the Blocks.372 In the damages phase, Ecuador argued similarly that Perenco contributed to the *coactiva* dispute by refusing to pay Law 42 dues, by threatening suit against persons who purchased the oil at auction, and by suspending operations, knowing that this would force the State to intervene and ultimately could be a ground for *caducidad*.373\n\nResp. C-Mem. M., paragraph 599; Resp. Rej. M., paragraphs 16, 290-296.\n\nResp. Rej. Q., paragraphs 507-512, 523-525.\n\n**1. Ecuador's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n328.\n\nEcuador thus argued that if Perenco was entitled to any damages at all, they ought to be reduced on grounds of contributory negligence. It argued that international law is clear that simple negligence (demonstrating a lack of due care for one's own property or rights374) that concurrently contributes to a loss is sufficient to establish contributory negligence.375\n\nILC Articles, Art. 39, comment 5.\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 105.\n\n329.\n\nIn its view, Perenco's refusal to pay the amounts due under Law 42 was inherently negligent because it compelled Ecuador to react. Ecuador argued that its own alleged breaches of international law were irrelevant to Perenco's contributory negligence because the doctrine of contributory negligence exists in order to reduce the damages from a respondent's breach on account of the claimant's own negligent contribution to the loss it has suffered. Ecuador submitted that if Perenco's excuse for what Ecuador termed \"tax evasion\"376 (that is, Ecuador's response was contrary to its international rights) were to be accepted, the doctrine of contributory negligence would have no possible application. Ecuador relied in this regard on the awards in *Goetz*, *Occidental* and *Yukos* where tribunals found the claimants were contributorily negligent for instigating the State's breach and therefore the damages to be awarded were adjusted downward.377\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraph 167.\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraph 169, fn. 265 referring to Cl. Rep. Q., paragraph 208 (\"... in *Goetz II*, the tribunal reduced the damages awarded to claimants on the grounds that claimants had failed to comply with the applicable exchange regulation. [\u2026] In *Occidental II*, the tribunal recognized that 'an award of damages may be reduced if the claiming party also committed a fault which contributed' to its loss, and held that in that case the investor 'acted negligently and committed an unlawful act' in failing to obtain prior ministerial authorization to transfer rights under its participation contract. [\u2026] In *Yukos*, the tribunal found that, unlike other Russian companies, Yukos 'breached the legislation and abused the low tax regimes\u2026through the sham-like nature' of its operations in certain regions\") (citing *Antoine Goetz & Consorts et S.A. v. Burundi*, Award, 21 June 2012, \u00b6 258, EL-289; *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and* *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador*, Award, 5 October 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 678-679, CA-431; *Yukos Universal Ltd. v. Russia,* PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award, 18 July 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 1611, 1615, CA-447). *Gemplus* is the exception that proves the rule: the tribunal rejected contributory negligence only because it was impossible for the claimants to have known that its employee had a criminal past. *Gemplus v. Mexico*, Award, 10 June 2010, \u00b6 11.14, CA-439.\"\n\n330.\n\nIn addition, Ecuador contended, Perenco was negligent, or even reckless, in suspending ongoing operations in the Blocks and consciously ignoring the risks of environmental harm and production losses. By suspending operations on short notice,378 Perenco acted in reckless disregard even in relation to its own rights, even though it foresaw that Ecuador would be forced to respond. Even if Perenco were permitted in principle to suspend operations, Perenco could not do so regardless of the risks. Mr. Perrodo repeatedly conceded that he decided to suspend operations despite his full awareness of the risks. Specifically, Mr. Perrodo admitted that he was aware that suspending operations involved serious risks, including production losses in Blocks 7 and 21 and environmental damage to the Ecuadorian Amazon.379 He recognised that these risks would force Ecuador to respond and might result in *caducidad*.380 He admitted that, consciously disregarding these serious risks, he decided to suspend operations in Block 7 and 21.381\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 199: \"On 13 July 2009, Perenco and Burlington jointly wrote to Minister Pinto to inform Ecuador of the Consortium's intention to commence the suspension of its operations on 16 July 2009.\"\n\nTr. Q. (2) 554:13-555:12 (Perrodo).\n\nTr. Q. (2) 560:11-19 (Perrodo).\n\nTr. Q. (2) 561:3-8 (Perrodo).\n\n331.\n\nEcuador argued further that Perenco's conduct during the Parties' negotiations was negligent and led to the breakdown of negotiations. It had rejected Ecuador's proposals, making the negotiation process even more difficult. Contrary to what Perenco alleges, the Tribunal never found that Perenco was justified in terminating the negotiations based on \"Ecuador's unlawful coercion.\"382 Perenco's failure to \"make its best efforts\" to finalize the renegotiation of the Participation Contracts pursuant to the *Actas de Acuerdo Parcial* of October 2008, after having signed three partial agreements throughout 2008, amounted to an \"unjustified\" termination of the negotiation which gave rise to *culpa in contrahendo*.383\n\nResp. Rej. Q., paragraph 519.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n332.\n\nEcuador further argued that Perenco could not rely on the argument that Ecuador's unlawful conduct was the proximate cause of *caducidad*. A single event might have multiple proximate causes. The doctrine of contributory negligence depends on this possibility. Contributory negligence reduces compensation exactly when the respondent and the claimant both contribute to or proximately cause the claimant's loss. Article 39 of the Articles on State Responsibility deals with this situation.384 Ecuador's alleged proximate causation does not change the fact that Perenco's refusal to pay its Law 42 taxes and its decision to abandon the oil fields directly contributed to *caducidad*.385\n\nILC Articles, Art. 39, comment 1.\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraph 181.\n\n333.\n\nFinally, if Perenco referred to *coactivas* and the oil auction as the proximate cause of *caducidad*, Perenco's reckless decision to suspend operations in the Blocks were a more direct cause of *caducidad* than the *coactivas* and the oil auction.386\n\n*Idem.*\n\n**2. Perenco's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n334.\n\nPerenco responded that Ecuador bears the burden of proving two elements of its contributory fault theory. First, Ecuador must show that Perenco committed a wrongful act, whether intentional or negligent; bad business decisions that might have increased the investor's risks do not rise to the level of culpable fault capable of supporting a finding of contributory fault.387\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraphs 202-216.\n\n335.\n\nPerenco's refusal to pay the Law 42 amounts cannot be characterised as negligent because the Tribunal has already rejected Ecuador's claim that Perenco had no legal basis to withhold Law 42 payments. The Tribunal has acknowledged that Perenco was justified in withholding direct payment of Law 42 dues after commencement of the arbitration.388 Perenco legitimately expected that Ecuador would comply with the Tribunal's binding orders and that this relieved Perenco from making those direct payments. Its refusal thus could not be characterised as a culpable act that manifested a disregard for Ecuador's rights and for which Perenco should be penalised.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 219-221.\n\n336.\n\nMoreover, given the position taken by two Ecuadorian Attorney-Generals that Law 42 was not a tax law and that the dues collected pursuant to it were not collected by Ecuadorian tax authorities, it was not reasonable and realistic to suggest that Perenco should have paid Law 42 dues to Petroecuador and then petitioned Ecuador's tax authorities in order to contest them.389\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 134.\n\n337.\n\nIn relation to Perenco's suspension of operations following Ecuador's disregard of the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures and issuance of *coactivas*, the Tribunal had found that Perenco's suspension of operations was justified under the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* principle. The defence was open to Perenco and that therefore Perenco could lawfully suspend operations when faced with a breach of contract without itself being found to be in breach.390 And, as Mr. Perrodo had testified, there had been no interruptions in operations and the company had taken the decision to suspend only as a last resort.\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraphs 435 & 704; 412.\n\n338.\n\nRegarding Perenco's alleged failure to obtain Burlington's agreement to abandon the Participation Contracts and agree to an unspecified future contractual form, the Tribunal had found that Perenco was not liable for Burlington's decision not to abandon its contractual rights, that Burlington had good reasons for doing so, that Ecuador acted abruptly and coercively during the negotiations, and that Ecuador \u2013 not Perenco \u2013 was responsible for the failure of negotiations.391 In any event, Ecuadorian law recognises that liability for breaking off contractual negotiations (*culpa in contrahendo*) does not arise unless there are exceptional circumstances. There can be no liability if there was a legitimate basis to end negotiations. Even if Perenco had terminated negotiations (which, as the Tribunal found, was not the case), Ecuador's unlawful coercion of Perenco would have been a more than sufficient justification.392\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 226.\n\n*cf.* Decision on Liability, paragraphs 609-612; 621-625.\n\n339.\n\nPerenco argued further that Ecuador could not show the second element of contributory fault, namely, that this fault interrupted the chain of causation. Contributory fault requires conduct by the investor that breaks the causal nexus such that the injury can be considered severable.393 Perenco pointed out that Ecuador's own authorities recognised that wrongful conduct by the investor that is a concurrent cause for the loss does not exonerate the State from liability altogether. Ecuador must prove that Perenco would have suffered the loss even if Ecuador had not committed its unlawful acts.394\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 213.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 215.\n\n340.\n\nThe Tribunal has already confirmed that Ecuador's unlawful conduct was the proximate cause of *caducidad*. This was not addressed by Ecuador at the Quantum Hearing.395 Ecuador could not establish that any of the above was the proximate cause of Ecuador's declaration of *caducidad*. It was Ecuador's choice in exercising its discretion that directly triggered *caducidad*.396\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 136.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 234 citing Decision on Liability, paragraphs 708, 710.\n\n341.\n\nFurther, Perenco had made it clear it would resume operations if Ecuador complied with the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures.397 If that had occurred, the Consortium would have continued to operate the Blocks, and Ecuador would not have declared *caducidad*. The proximate cause was therefore Ecuador's failure to comply with the provisional measures, not Perenco's later suspension of operations.398\n\nCE-238; CE-243; Decision on Liability, paragraph 692.\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 236.\n\n342.\n\nEcuador also did not declare *caducidad* due to Burlington's attitude but because of a suspension that was caused by Ecuador's failure to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures.\n\n343.\n\nFinally, Perenco pointed out that Ecuador did not deny that its contributory fault defence was limited to *caducidad* in any event. Even if it had any legal or factual basis, it could not affect damages for Ecuador's violations of Article 4 of the Treaty or for its breach of the Contracts through Decree 662.399\n\nCl. PHB Q., paragraph 137.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article 39 of the ILC Articles, entitled \"*Contribution to the injury*\", states that in the determination of reparation, \"account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation it sought.\"400 While the inclusion of the word \"wilful\" broadens the scope of the article beyond negligence, such broadening does not, in the Tribunal's view, appear to be substantial. The ILC Commentaries noted in this regard that the focus \"is on situations which in national law systems are referred to as 'contributory negligence', 'comparative fault', '*faute de la victime* ', *etc*.401 Commentary (5) to the article notes further that it allows to be taken into account \"*only* those actions or omissions which can be considered as wilful or negligent, *i.e.* which manifests a lack of due care on the part of the victim of the breach *for his or her own property or rights*.\"402 The Tribunal therefore proceeds on the basis that in order for Ecuador's submissions to succeed, the Tribunal must be satisfied that Perenco manifested a lack of due care for its own property or rights.\n\nILC Articles, Article 39.\n\n*Ibid*., Commentary (1).\n\n*Ibid*., Commentary (5).\n\n345.\n\nEcuador has identified a number of instances where it considers Perenco contributed to the damages which it has suffered.\n\n346.\n\nPutting them in rough chronological order, the first is the contention that Perenco's overall conduct during the negotiation process contributed to its loss in that on several occasions, Perenco rejected Ecuador's proposals, thus making the negotiation process more difficult, refused to discuss drafts of transfer agreements that Ecuador proposed on 16 May 2008 and 10 July 2008, did not make its best efforts to finalise the new renegotiation of the Participation Contracts into services contracts as agreed in the October 2008 *Actas*, failed to secure Burlington's agreement to the final draft transitory agreement despite knowing that such failure would have serious consequences, and \"cynically\" sought to reopen the negotiations in May 2009.403\n\nResp. Rej. Q., paragraphs 517-519.\n\n347.\n\nSecond, Ecuador contended that Perenco's refusal to comply with Ecuadorian law and pay Law 42 dues was \"grossly negligent.\"404\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraph 166; Resp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 106. In an earlier version of this contention, Ecuador seemed to argue that Perenco was negligent when it stopped paying despite the fact that it was economically capable of doing so (Resp. C-Mem. Q., paragraphs 316, 323).\n\n348.\n\nThird, Perenco's boycott of the auctions of the seized oil during the *coactiva* process and its threatening legal action against any company that participated in the auction was said to have contributed to its loss.405\n\nResp. Rej. Q., paragraphs 523-524.\n\n349.\n\nFourth, Perenco was said to have acted negligently and recklessly in suspending operations while consciously ignoring the risk of environmental harm and production loss. In doing so, Perenco acted in \"reckless disregard for its own rights\" despite specifically foreseeing that Ecuador would be forced to respond.406\n\nResp. PHB Q., paragraph 171; Resp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 106,\n\n350.\n\nFifth, Perenco's failure to resume operations in the Blocks (after having suspended operations) despite invitations for it to do was also said to have contributed to the harm which it suffered.407\n\nResp. Rej. Q., paragraph 505.\n\n351.\n\nBefore addressing these claimed instances of contributory fault, it is worth noting that the first completed breach, Decree 662, set in train two main types of damage: (i) a further reduced \"take\" for the contractor; and (ii) the virtual immediate cessation of drilling activity in both Blocks. Perenco in no way contributed to the damage proximately caused by this measure. Indeed, the various acts complained of by Ecuador all followed Ecuador's decision to ratchet up the State's take from 50% of the 'above reference price revenues' to 99%.\n\n352.\n\nSome of the alleged instances of contributory fault can be dismissed summarily. The Tribunal cannot accept that Perenco's overall conduct during the negotiation process contributed to its loss. None of the alleged instances of contributory fault said to arise from Perenco's responses to Ecuador's contractual demands can be considered to amount to wilful or negligent conduct within the meaning of Article 39 of the ILC Articles. The Tribunal has already found that it was Ecuador that escalated its demands and threats over time and that for its part Perenco sought to accommodate such demands to the best of its ability.408 For example, the failure to secure Burlington's consent to the terms of the October 2008 *Acta* simply cannot be viewed as being within Perenco's control, let alone a wilful or negligent act on its part.\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 625.\n\n353.\n\nLikewise, for two reasons, Perenco's decision to suspend operation of the two Blocks in July 2009, which the Tribunal has already found in its Decision could be justified under Ecuadorian law409, cannot be viewed as a wilful or negligent act which contributed to the harm that it ultimately suffered. The Tribunal has found that Ecuador committed a breach of contract by failing to comply with the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures, that Perenco had a contractual right to expect Ecuador's compliance with such, and that faced with Ecuador's refusal, Perenco had the right to suspend performance under Ecuadorian law.410 (The Tribunal also found that just as Perenco had a right to suspend performance Ecuador had a correlative right to intervene in order to operate and protect the Blocks.411) Ultimately, it was the State's decision to declare *caducidad* that amounted to the last completed breach.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 434 \u2013 435.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 417. In the Tribunal's view, a plain reading of clauses 22.2.2 indicates that the contracting parties agreed that they would comply not only with a final award (i.e., in Spanish, the '*laudo*' issued by a tribunal), but in addition, they would observe and comply with the decisions (i.e., in Spanish, the '*decisiones* ') of the tribunal. 657 The latter term constitutes a more capacious category of tribunal decisions of which the final award forms a part. Thus, under the Participation Contracts, Ecuador was bound to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures and its failure to do so constituted a breach of contract.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 704.\n\n354.\n\nTo the extent that Ecuador traces this back to a refusal to pay Law 42 dues, as discussed below, given the intermediation of the Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal cannot find that Perenco contributed to Ecuador's decision to expropriate its interests in the Blocks.\n\n355.\n\nIn addition, to the extent that Ecuador complains that, for example, the day after Perenco suspended operations, it notified its employees in the Blocks that their employment contracts were terminated, and therefore it \"prematurely manufactured a situation in which was difficult to resume operations\"412, in the Tribunal's view, Ecuador has not quantified the loss that it might have suffered when Petroamazonas had to take over production, nor has it shown that laying off employees led to a loss occasioned to Perenco for which Perenco now seeks compensation. (The issue of employee costs is comprehended in the calculation of lost profits for Block 21 and does not arise to any significant degree in relation to Block 7 since *caducidad* applied only to the remaining one month of the Block 7 Contract's life.)\n\nResp. Rej. Q., paragraph 507.\n\n356.\n\nAs to the steps taken by Perenco to refuse to pay Law 42 dues and instead depositing them in an off-shore account rather than paying them to Ecuador (which began after the dispute was submitted to arbitration but before the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional Measures and therefore initially was taken without the cover of a tribunal decision), in the Tribunal's view, Perenco *did* assume the risk that the Tribunal might not uphold its legal position in all respects. In addition, by declining to pay Law 42 dues to Ecuador, it was or should have been reasonably foreseeable to Perenco that this could invite a strong response from the State.\n\n357.\n\nSuch a response did in fact occur in the form of Ecuador's notice of its intention to commence *coactivas* in order to liquidate Perenco's Law 42 debt for 2008.413 To that extent, Perenco's action exacerbated the situation, but this is not the end of the analysis of this claimed instance of contributory fault. Not long after the Tribunal held its first meeting with the Parties \u2013at which Perenco had foreshadowed the possibility of a provisional measures application\u2013 such an application was in fact made. The Tribunal ended up granting Perenco's request and recommended such measures. The Tribunal specifically recommended that Ecuador refrain from taking *coactiva* measures against Perenco and further called upon the Parties to negotiate an escrow arrangement that would preserve their respective claims to the disputed funds pending the outcome of the arbitration.414 This proved not to be possible for Ecuador. Ecuador explained its view in a respectful and nonconfrontational manner that it could not comply with the measures recommended by the Tribunal and that it was bound to initiate the *coactivas*. But the Tribunal later found in its Decision on Liability that Perenco was within its contractual rights to expect that Ecuador would comply with the Tribunal's provisional measures recommendations.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, paragraph 22.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 79, 80.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the relevant findings in its prior Decision on Liability:\n\n\"694. The Tribunal has already found that Perenco had a reasonable expectation under the Participation Contracts that Ecuador would comply with any decision of the Tribunal. This contractual expectation was buttressed by the general expectation that any disputing party has that once the dispute is submitted to arbitration, both parties will seek to conform their conduct to the Tribunal's directives, particularly with respect to the non-aggravation of the dispute.\n\n695. Ecuador found itself unable to comply with the Tribunal's Decision in this case. The Tribunal can well understand why in 2009, in applying a domestic law, Ecuador would wish to liquidate the amounts claimed to be owing for 2008. However, when the matter was put before the Tribunal, Ecuador's duty to enforce the law conflicted with its contractual obligation to comply with decisions of the Tribunal. The Tribunal recommended what it considered to be a reasonable way to protect both Parties' rights pending a final determination of their dispute. Regrettably, this was not possible in the circumstances. Perenco is correct to point out that had the State stayed its hand in relation to the *coactivas*, the dispute would not have been aggravated in the way in which it was.\"415 [Emphasis added.]\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraphs 694-695.\n\n359.\n\nIn adversarial proceedings, a disputing party's view of its adversary's conduct as unacceptable or inappropriate is usually viewed by the other party as perfectly acceptable and appropriate in the circumstances. In the Tribunal's view, it is wrong to equate a party's zealous protection of its legal rights and interests with wilful conduct or contributory negligence within the meaning of the ILC Articles. Perenco did assume a risk when it unilaterally decided to pay the Law 42 amounts into an offshore account. However, and crucially, it then obtained the protection of a Tribunal recommendation that Ecuador not take *coactiva* action, as well as a recommendation that the Parties agree an escrow account arrangement so that the disputed Law 42 dues could be paid into it pending the outcome of the arbitration (an arrangement which proved to be unattainable in the circumstances).\n\n360.\n\nPerenco was, in the circumstances, entitled to rely upon the Tribunal's recommendation and this cannot be considered to be a wilful or negligent contribution to the loss that it ultimately suffered when Ecuador enforced the *coactivas*. While Perenco's act of self-help *prior* to the Tribunal's consideration of its request for provisional measures was aggressive and perhaps even provocative, it must be viewed in context. Ecuador itself was hardly blameless in terms of the way in which it escalated pressure on Perenco.416 In the end, since provisional measures were granted, the Tribunal does not find Perenco's conduct in this regard to be wilful or negligent within the meaning of the ILC Articles once that conduct received the colour of right conferred by the Tribunal's ruling in Perenco's favour. At that point, Perenco was legally entitled to act as it did and it was Ecuador that acted inconsistently with the Tribunal's recommendation.\n\nSuch as, for example, blaming Perenco for failing to get the *Acta* agreed and threatening it with termination and even expulsion from the country. In its Decision on Liability, paragraphs 144-145, with reference to the Parties' correspondence, the Tribunal recounted the fact that on 24 December 2008, Perenco received a letter from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum stating that \"as a result of the impossibility of arriving at a final agreement between the parties, due to the intransigent position of your partner Burlington Resources, I would be very grateful if you would immediately instruct your work team to initiate the process of reversion of Block 7, the contract for which ends in the year 2010. Moreover, PERENCO, in its capacity as Operator, must also immediately assign its negotiating team to early termination of the Block 21 contract, by mutual agreement.\" Perenco then wrote to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum requesting him to reconsider the position expressed in the letter of 24 December 2008. But on 21 January 2009, the Minister of Mines and Petroleum announced that the negotiations to have Perenco continue operating in Ecuador had become \"practically impossible.\"\n\n361.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal declines therefore to find this to be an act of contributory fault, one aspect of Ecuador's argument is accepted. As discussed below, Ecuador's point is addressed through the Tribunal's calculation of the damages owing. In deciding the amount of compensation owing for the unlawful imposition of Decree 662, the Tribunal has agreed with Brattle's view that if a party that claims compensation for the levying of a tax has not actually paid some or all of the tax, it cannot be compensated for that part of the damages which have been calculated on the assumption that the tax was paid. Thus, the Tribunal's 'true-up' addresses this aspect of Ecuador's contributory negligence argument.\n\n362.\n\nTurning to the conduct of the auctions of oil seized through the *coactivas*, once again the Tribunal agrees that Perenco contributed to the depressed price of oil obtained in the *coactiva* auctions (by threatening suit against would-be purchasers). But when considered in light of the provisional measures already granted by the Tribunal, Perenco has the better position. Ecuador was evidently able to sell the seized oil at the market price. Given that it was the purchaser of the oil, it benefited from the depressed purchase price yet credited Perenco's Law 42 debt with the depressed price rather than the market value of that oil. In doing so, it realised an enrichment that in the Tribunal's view, having regard to the status of the provisional measures ruling, it would be unjust to enjoy.417 For that reason, the Tribunal cannot find that Perenco acted wilfully or negligently in standing on its rights and threatening suit against would-be purchasers. In all of the circumstances, it was unfair for Ecuador to buy the oil at a discount and then credit Perenco for only that depressed value. For that reason, the Tribunal also includes this in the 'true-up' adjustment to the damages, an adjustment that this time redounds to Perenco's benefit.\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 703.\n\n363.\n\nTherefore, the various claims of contributory negligence are unavailing.\n\nH. **The 'true-up' issue**\n--------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThis takes the Tribunal to the final part of the damages exercise, which is to consider Ecuador's 'true-up' case. The essence of the case is that Ecuador considers, among other things, that since the Tribunal found no breach of contract or the Treaty for Law 42 at 50% and because, on Ecuador's reading of the Contracts, their economy was never disturbed at 50% or at 99%, Perenco owes it a substantial amount of unpaid Law 42 dues.\n\n**1. Ecuador's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n365.\n\nEcuador contended that the damages owed to Perenco were either nil \u2013 once offsetting dues said to be owed under Law 42 are included in the analysis (the \"true-up\") or at best the Respondent owed Perenco US$114.3 million.418\n\n**Table 1: Summary of Damages (US$ mn)**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Stabilisation Scenario |\n| #1 (No Stabilisation) | #2 (Stabilisation Decree 662 Only, New X Factor) | #3 (Hypothetical Tax Threshold at 81%) | #4 (Stabilisation Decree 662 Only, Side-Payment of Oil) |\n| Gross Damages |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| FET Claim (Oct-07) | [1] | See note | 0.0 | 3.6 | 62.9 | 184.4 |\n| Expropriation (Jul-10) | [2] | See note | 13.7 | 13.7 | 13.7 | 13.7 |\n| Gross Harm | [3] | [1]+[2] | 13.7 | 17.3 | 76.6 | 198.1 |\n| True Up |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| #1 (Auction Prices) | [4] | See note | 216.2 | 216.2 | 216.2 | 216.2 |\n| #2 (Market Prices at Date of Production) | [5] | See note | 125.6 | 125.6 | 125.6 | 125.6 |\n| S3 (Market Prices on Auction Date) | [6] | See note | 83.7 | 83.7 | 83.7 | 83.7 |\n| Damages Net of True Up |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Net of True Up #1 | [7] | Max{[3]-[4],0} | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n| Net of True Up #2 | [8] | Max{[3]-[5],0} | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 72.5 |\n| Net of True Up #3 | [9] | Max{[3]-[6],0} | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 114.3 |\n\nNotes and sources:  \nAll values in US$mn as at September 2015, including simple interest.  \n[1] & [2]: Brattle Workpapers, Tables M3 & M4.  \n[4] to [6]: Table 2.\n\nBrattle ER III, Table 1.\n\n366.\n\nEcuador argued that the Tribunal should apply the 'true-up' so as to account for the amount owed by Perenco to Ecuador as a consequence of: (i) the Consortium's withholding significant Law 42 dues (not only Decree 662 dues) since 2008; and (ii) Ecuador's having to fund the Blocks' operations for one full year from July 2009 until July 2010, while crediting the Consortium with production.\n\n367.\n\nBrattle calculated three alternative 'true-up' figures depending on the price used to account for the oil seized and sold by Ecuador under the *coactivas* (higher prices meaning a lower debt for Perenco).419 Ecuador contended that any compensation should take into consideration Perenco's contribution to the reduced sales price for the oil auctioned in the *coactivas* process. It is undisputed that Perenco boycotted the auctions, which led to the seized oil being sold at below the prevailing market price.\n\nUS$216.2 million (price at which Ecuador sold the seized oil), US$125.6 million (market prices as of the date of production of the seized oil), and US$83.7 million (market prices on auction date) (Brattle ER II, Table 1, p. vi). However, this distinction becomes irrelevant in three of the four stabilization scenarios analyzed by Brattle because the damages net of true up are US$0 regardless of the alternative used (Brattle ER II, Table 1, p. vi.).\n\n368.\n\nEcuador contended that the appropriate amount to be set-off is $216 million, given that Perenco illegally prevented Ecuador from selling the oil at a higher price. Should the Tribunal consider that Ecuador was to blame for the reduced auction, the set-off would be $125.6 million.\n\n369.\n\nBrattle explained that the calculation of 'true-up' is *ex post* in nature (*i.e.,* it employs actual prices)420 in contrast to the approach proposed by Brattle (accepted by the Tribunal) of calculating damages to Perenco *ex ante*. The 'true-up' must adopt an *ex post* perspective since it must assess what Law 42 amounts were actually paid by the Consortium and which levies remain outstanding. Ecuador asserted that Professor Kalt never took issue with the concept.421 It further explained that imposing on Perenco the change in oil prices when it chose to withhold taxes was entirely appropriate, while also acknowledging that the allocation of risks was ultimately an issue for the Tribunal. Hence the sensitivity calculations that it performed of the \"true-up.\"\n\nBrattle ER II, paragraph 53.\n\nResp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 101(v).\n\n**2. Perenco's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n370.\n\nPerenco takes issue with Professor Dow's claim that his analysis of the impact of Decree 662 as of October 2007 does not benefit from the use of hindsight. This is untrue. When Professor Dow calculated his \"true-up\" for Law 42 amounts and for the 2009-2010 operating expenses allegedly owed by Perenco to Ecuador, he improperly mixed his *ex ante* calculation with *ex post* data. This was not an inconsequential error. The oil prices produced as of October 2007 were substantially lower than the actual prices in the market. Thus, in Professor Dow's model, Perenco was made purportedly indifferent to Decree 662 in October 2007 at relatively low forecasted prices, but that price of indifference sum is then offset by actual Law 42 assessments made on the basis of far higher prices.422\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 255.\n\n371.\n\nOn this basis, Professor Dow calculated minimum and maximum true-up amounts of US$83.7 million and US$216.2 million, respectively.423 Yet in Perenco's view, there is no reason why *ex post* data should be allowed to calculate Perenco's alleged liabilities, but not to calculate Perenco's entitlement to damages. In fact, such mixing of *ex post* and *ex ante* data fails to transfer the risks of oil prices to Ecuador, despite Professor Dow's claim that an *ex ante* approach \"acknowledges this transfer of risk, for good or for bad, at the time of the expropriation.\"424 Professor Dow's willingness to mix and match *ex ante* and *ex post* information when the result is reduction in Perenco's damages is unprincipled.\n\nSee Brattle ER III, Table 1 (also set out above).\n\nCl. Rep. Q., paragraph 256 citing Brattle ER II, paragraph 65.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Decision**\n------------------------------\n\n372.\n\nFor present purposes, the Tribunal considers that to the extent that a 'true-up' is appropriate with respect to *unpaid* Law 42 levies, after the Consortium suspended payment in April 2008, the true-up must adhere to the *ex ante* assumptions of future oil prices. Obviously, this issue is also linked to the level of taxation pursuant to Law 42 that the Tribunal has decided was not proven to be unlawful prior to the adoption of Decree 662 (*i.e*., Law 42 at 50% up to October 2008 and Law 42 at 33% thereafter.)\n\n373.\n\nEither way, the Tribunal agrees in this respect with Professor Kalt that Brattle mixed *ex ante* and *ex post* data in order to arrive at its true-up calculations for the difference between the tax payments assumed in the 4 October 2007 FMV estimation and the actual amounts that were subsequently calculated by Ecuador and imposed in the latter part of 2007-2008 before prices crashed, and again in 2010, when prices recovered.\n\n374.\n\nProfessor Kalt made the point as follows:\n\n\"The hypothetical 'buyer' of rights in Brattle's framework (Ecuador) has essentially said to the hypothetical willing seller (Perenco): 'Back in October 2007, we agreed I would pay you $X (plus interest) in 2015 for you to allow me to impose a 99% tax on your revenues for the life of the Blocks. As it turns out, market conditions were such that I've ended up levying $2X on you, but only actually collecting $.9X from you. So, I am going to deduct $1.1X ($2X minus $.9X) from X and I won't have to pay you anything. After all, you agreed in our fair market transaction back in 2007 to let me levy a 99% tax on you, and you took the risk that my tax assessments would turn out to be larger than either of us originally anticipated.'\"425\n\nKalt ER IV, paragraph 56.\n\n375.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the general thrust of this criticism.426 Ecuador cannot have it both ways and must be held to its side of the compensation calculation. With an *ex ante* approach, the financial impact of the tax is assessed as of October 2007 and that is the measure of compensation. It would be unfair to permit Ecuador to take the position that an unforeseen increase in oil prices and consequently higher actual Law 42 levies should be imposed on Perenco when conducting the 'true-up'. By the Tribunal's acceptance of Ecuador's argument that damages must be calculated on an *ex ante* basis, this crystallises the tax's impact as of 4 October 2007 in the 'but for' world. Ecuador thus foregoes the right to seek additional amounts based on subsequent unforeseen market developments. Therefore, the Tribunal will not permit the difference between the anticipated levies used in the FMV calculations and the actual amounts levied to be set-off against Perenco.427 The 'true-up' as originally calculated by Brattle has therefore been adjusted to take out Brattle's initial use of *ex post* pricing data which had the effect of increasing the amount that Perenco was said to owe Ecuador.\n\nThe Brattle Group essentially admitted that this was the case at Brattle ER III, paragraph 103: \"Professor Kalt is nevertheless correct that this approach to computing the true-up imposes on Perenco the risk of deviations between the price and production expectations implicit in our ex-ante assessment of the damages for Decree 662, and the prevailing prices and production when the various decisions to withhold payment, seize oil and vacate/enter the blocks occurred. Prevailing prices, production and costs at the time of the separate decisions to withhold payment, seize production and vacate/enter the blocks turned out to be at times higher and at times lower than those expected in October 2007, resulting in either higher or lower credits to Perenco than implicit in the ex-ante analysis of Decree 662.\" At paragraphs 106-107, Brattle sought to justify its approach, but the Tribunal considers that it would be most consistent with the *ex ante* approach to hold both Parties to the assumed financial impact of the tax going forward.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Brattle has stated at fn 6 of its Brattle ER III that it performed this sort of calculation: \"\u2026 we compute a fourth alternative, which uses October 2007 price expectations instead of outturn prices (whether actuals or coactivas auctions). This fourth measure insulates Perenco from the risk of deviations between the price expectations prevailing at the time Ecuador issued Decree 662, and when Perenco then withheld payment, Ecuador seized consortium production in response, and Perenco finally vacated/Ecuador entered the blocks. We present these calculations in Appendix E.\"\n\n376.\n\nThere are, however, some *ex post* developments that in fairness must be taken into consideration. The payment of damages for Decree 662 calculated on an *ex ante* basis assumes not only a particular oil price, as just discussed, but also that the person subject to the unlawful tax has actually paid it. The Consortium paid Law 42 dues at 99% from 4 October 2007 until 30 April 2008 when it opened the off-shore bank account into which Law 42 dues were thereafter deposited. Perenco would be unjustly enriched if it received damages for the period when it did not actually remit the Law 42 fees to Ecuador. Therefore, the Tribunal has taken that into consideration when calculating the true-up.\n\n377.\n\nIt has been further adjusted to reflect the fact that Perenco did not succeed in proving a breach of contract or Treaty in respect of Law 42 at 50%. However, it reflects the unlawful demand for an additional 49% of the extraordinary revenues as well as the Tribunal's finding that Perenco would have sought absorption pursuant to the Contracts' modification clauses and the Parties would have agreed to stabilisation at 33% as of October 2008.\n\n378.\n\nAdditionally, it has been adjusted to address Perenco's share of termination costs related to the implementation of Decree 662428 as well as Ecuador's claimed expenses during the time of Perenco's suspension of its operatorship.\n\nExhibits JK-64 and JK-51.\n\n379.\n\nThe 'true-up' must also address the *coactivas* issue in Perenco's favour. As the Tribunal noted in its earlier Decision on Liability, it was unfair and inequitable for Ecuador to seize Perenco's production in order to satisfy its tax payment demand and then to credit Perenco with the depressed price rather than the market price. The Tribunal acknowledges that this occurred in the contentious circumstances of Ecuador's non-compliance with the Tribunal's attempt to prevent the further aggravation of the dispute. It also notes that since Ecuador successfully defended the claims against Law 42 at 50%, Perenco's having assumed the risk that it would prevail on all claims exposed it to the situation it now finds itself in, namely, that only the collection of Law 42 at 99% was found to amount to a breach for which compensation is due and therefore Law 42 at 50% \u2013 at least up until Decree 662 \u2013 must be presumptively treated as lawful. As the Tribunal noted in its previous Decision on Liability:\n\n\"It considers that Perenco had a right to expect that Ecuador would desist from enforcing the *coactivas* during the pendency of the arbitration. It also considers that in deciding to withhold all Law 42 amounts claimed in 2008, Perenco assumed that the Tribunal would accept its claims that none of the Law 42 dues claimed by the State were permissible under the Contracts or the Treaty. Given that Perenco has not made out its claims in respect of Law 42 at 50%, the Tribunal holds that even though Ecuador should have complied with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the *coactivas* ought not to be included in the Tribunal's analysis of the measures said collectively to constitute an indirect expropriation\u2026In addition, to the extent that Perenco has succeeded in its claim that the application of Decree 662 at 99% violated Article 4 of the Treaty, as found at paragraphs 606-607 above, the enforcement of the *coactivas* to collect the claimed additional 49% constituted a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, but it was not an expropriation of the investment.).\"429 [Emphasis added.]\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 703.\n\n380.\n\nIn the end, neither Party emerges from this part of the dispute as the clear winner and the 'true-up' must reflect this mixed success.\n\nI. **Quantum Based on a 'Harmonised Model'**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nBefore the Tribunal estimates the financial consequences on Blocks 7 and 21 in light of Ecuador's breaches, it is necessary to explain the methodology that was used to estimate the damages to be awarded for each individual claim in light of the factual and legal findings that the Tribunal has made in the preceding parts of this Award.\n\n382.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' submissions, the expert evidence and the other evidence on record, a 'harmonised model' was devised through which the Tribunal has calculated the damages to be awarded.\n\n383.\n\nAs described above, the Tribunal had been presented with damages valuation based on spreadsheet models submitted by Professor Kalt430 and Brattle.431 These models employed the same overall architecture432 but differed in respect of five major assumptions, which were the main issues that separated the Parties as ultimately identified and addressed in Section II.B, as well as other minor differences in assumptions. Given these similarities, a 'harmonised model' could be produced through the adjustments of the models to implement the Tribunal's findings. These changes are described below and also describes the 'harmonised model' employed by the Tribunal.\n\nProf. Kalt's spreadsheet models were provided as Exhibit JK-32 in the first round of pleadings on quantum and Exhibit JK-64 in the second round.\n\nBrattle's spreadsheet models were provided as Tables B and C in the first round of pleadings on quantum and Tables P and O in the second round.\n\nThe similarities in the models reflected in part the fact that Brattle took Professor Kalt's original spreadsheet models and then adjusted them to reflect its own assumptions and inputs.\n\n**1. The 'harmonised model'**\n-----------------------------\n\n384.\n\nThe 'harmonised model' assumes away the effect of Decree 662 and *caducidad* in order to arrive at the net present value of the discounted cash flows that would have been derived from Blocks 7 and 21. This is based on the production decisions that the Tribunal has found Perenco would have made but for the unlawful measures. In order to address Professor Kalt's concerns, the Tribunal has employed the model to make an initial valuation of the damage caused by Decree 662 and then a second valuation of the damage caused by the declaration of *caducidad*.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that in the 'but for' world, Law 42 at 50% would have continued to apply from October 2007 until 5 October 2008 at which point, by party agreement, the rate would have been 33%, which rate would have applied from that date through to the respective expiry dates of the two Participation Contracts.\n\n386.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore first seeks to forecast the production in both Blocks in the 'but for' world for the first period and for Block 21 for the second period on an *ex ante* basis. After estimating the production levels, the production is then priced on the basis of *ex ante* expectations at the relevant times. The Tribunal then also seeks to estimate the amount of capital expenditure and operating expenditure, and other costs, associated with the assumed levels of production. The cash flows are then discounted to the relevant date of valuation, and then brought forward to the date of the Award at pre-award interest rates.\n\n387.\n\nFinally, the true-up is applied to reflect the acts discussed previously that affect the quantum calculation.\n\n388.\n\nThe following sections explain further each of these steps taken in relation to the 'harmonised model'.\n\n**2. Valuation Dates**\n----------------------\n\n389.\n\nThe first of the major assumptions that had to be adjusted in the 'harmonised model' was the relevant valuation dates. First, Professor Kalt's modelling of damages flowing from the period between October 2007 and June 2010, which was done on an *ex post* basis, was adjusted to reflect the Tribunal's conclusion that an *ex ante* analysis is to be employed. At the same time, Brattle's sequential 'two layer' approach was then adjusted to create a 'clean sheet' for damages in respect of the expropriation on 20 July 2010.\n\n390.\n\nThis means that the damages are estimated in respect of the 4 October 2007 breach on the basis of forecasted cash flows up until June 2010, and cash flows that would have occurred between October 2007 and June 2010 are discounted back to the October 2007 valuation date. For damages flowing from the July 2010 expropriation, this is based on forecasted cash flows until the expiry of the Blocks 7 and 21 Participation Contracts (16 August 2010 and 8 June 2021, respectively433). If a cash flow would have occurred after July 2010, this is discounted back to the July 2010 valuation date. The discount rate applied is 12%, which was the rate utilised by both Parties' experts.434\n\nCrick WS II.\n\nKalt ER III, paragraph 30 and Brattle ER II, paragraph 163.\n\n**3. Production and Investment**\n--------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nThe second issue on which the experts' models differed was the investment and production to be forecasted 'but for' Ecuador's conduct. Professor Kalt's models reflected Mr. Crick's analysis and projections; the Brattle models reflected RPS' analysis and projections.\n\n392.\n\nFor Block 7, the Tribunal has estimated that 23 additional wells would have been drilled during the life of the Block 7 Participation Contract. Four wells would have been drilled by January 2008 and the remaining 19 would have been drilled between February 2008 and August 2009. Further, having concluded that Mr. Crick's production profiles as presented at the Quantum Hearing were to be preferred over those presented by RPS, and consistent with Mr. Crick's forecasts of new oil wells, the Tribunal accepts that all 'but for' wells during the production lifetime of Block 7 would be drilled in the Oso field within Area Base. The production volume calculated relies on Mr. Crick's forecasts435 but which are slightly adjusted for purposes of an *ex ante* analysis as of October 2007.436\n\nCrick WS III, Appendix B.\n\nMr. Crick's profile incorporates historical production figures for wells drilled prior to 2008 (see Crick WS II, paragraphs 6-8, 159, 172).\n\n393.\n\nMr. Crick also provided forecasts for Coca-Payamino. The 'harmonised model' adopts those numbers without amendments.437\n\nCrick WS III, Appendix B; Exhibit JK-94.\n\n394.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal forecasts that the 'but for' production in Block 7 would have been as follows. This is broken down into 'base' production *i.e.* oil which would have been produced in addition to base production absent Decree 662, and 'incremental' production *i.e.* oil which would have been produced in addition to base production but for Decree 662. Risk-adjustment factors as used in Exhibit JK-94 were applied to reflect the proved and probable reserves planned.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *All values in stb mln* | Risked production |\n| Base | Incremental - Oso Only | Total |\n| **Block 7 Area Base** |  |  |  |\n| Oct-07 to Jun-10 | 7.9 | 12.3 | 20.2 |\n| Jul-10 to Aug-10 | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.8 |\n| **Total** | **8.2** | **12.7** | **21.0** |\n| **Coca-Payamino** |  |  |  |\n| Oct-07 to Jun-10 | 4.9 | n/a | 4.9 |\n| Jul-10 to Aug-10 | 0.2 | n/a | 0.2 |\n| **Total** | **5.0** | **n/a** | **5.0** |\n| **Block 7 Total** |  |  |  |\n| Oct-07 to Jun-10 | 12.8 | 12.3 | 25.1 |\n| Jul-10 to Aug-10 | 0.5 | 0.4 | 0.9 |\n| **Total** | **13.3** | **12.7** | **26.0** |\n\n  \nNote: Gross production volumes.\n\n395.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's decision on the Block 7 extension question, no forecasts for production in Block 7 from August 2010 onwards are made.\n\n396.\n\nIn relation to Block 21, the Tribunal has concluded that an incremental six wells would have been drilled pre- *caducidad* and 10 would have been drilled post- *caducidad*. The pre- *caducidad* wells are assumed to have been drilled on a one-well-per-month schedule with incremental production commencing in August 2008, consistent with the drilling schedule proposed by Mr. Crick.438 Production for these six wells reflects the production from the first six wells (all 1P wells) according to Mr. Crick's schedule.439\n\nCrick WS III, paragraph 3.\n\n*Ibid.,* Appendix B.\n\n397.\n\nThe post- *caducidad* wells are assumed to have been drilled on a one-well-per-month schedule with incremental production commencing August 2010. In addition, Mr. Crick's testimony was that a small portion of oil produced from the new wells would have been produced from the existing wells, which were adjusted for in his profiles set out in his witness statement.440 Mr. Crick's small adjustment has been scaled to reflect the chosen production scenario.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *All values in stb mln* | Production |\n|  | Base | Incremental | Total |\n| ***Block 21*** |  |  |  |\n| Oct-07 to Jun-10 | 11.1 | 2.3 | 13.4 |\n| Jul-10 to Jun-21 | 23.2 | 5.8 | 28.9 |\n| **Total** | **34.3** | **8.0** | **42.3** |\n\n  \nNote: Gross production volumes.\n\n*Id.*\n\n**4. Prices for Oil Production**\n--------------------------------\n\n398.\n\nAs alluded to above, *ex ante* prices are applied to the production from each Block. However, as the evidence showed and which was not disputed, the oil quality of each Block differs \u2013 Block 7 produced Oriente quality crude oil and Block 21 Napo quality. Therefore, the *ex ante* prices for oil production from each Block and over different time periods had to be calculated.\n\n399.\n\nFirst, *ex-ante* WTI prices were used. These were NYMEX futures prices as of the two key dates of valuation: October 2007 and July 2010.441 These prices were slightly increased to reflect an insurance component embedded in futures prices.442\n\nBrattle Workpapers, Table D.\n\nBrattle ER II, paragraphs 214-219.\n\n400.\n\nSecond, these prices were adjusted to reflect the differences in quality between WTI crude oil and that produced in Ecuador *i.e.* Oriente and Napo crude oil. Since Oriente crude oil is of a relatively higher quality than Napo crude oil, the former generally commands a higher price.443 Using the historical price discounts applied to the two types of crude oil produced in Ecuador relative to WTI prices, the expected *ex ante* WTI prices were adjusted downwards to derive the expected *ex ante* Oriente prices, and downwards further for *ex ante* Napo prices.444\n\nThis difference is reflected in the historical price data exhibited in Exhibit JK-57 and Brattle Workpapers, Table D.\n\nExhibit JK-57 and Exhibit JK-96; Brattle Workpapers, Tables D and E; Kalt ER III, paragraphs 35-36; Brattle ER II, fn. 42.\n\n401.\n\nThird, these prices are adjusted further to reflect the specific quality of the crude oil produced in Blocks 7 and 21. These adjustments were made on the basis of the historical relationship between the prices and quality of the Oriente and Napo benchmarks and the prices and qualities of the field-specific oil, and the resulting field-specific price adjustment factors are consistent with formulas detailed in Ecuador's own calculations of oil prices in its Law 42 assessments.445 The field-specific adjustment factors are then applied to the benchmark oil prices in Ecuador (Oriente for Block 7 Area Base and Napo for Block 21) to generate field-specific prices.446\n\nE-228.\n\nExhibit JK-57, Exhibit JK-96, and Brattle Workpapers, Table E.\n\n**5. Operating Expenses (OPEX)**\n--------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nBenchmark operating costs have been adopted in the 'harmonised model'. This is consistent with the experts' financial models which both used similar operating cost calculations. However, these calculations were adjusted to reflect an *ex ante* modelling perspective as of the two valuation dates. Reliance has largely been placed on the benchmarks found in Exhibit JK-64, but with the Amazonian Eco-development Fund (\"*Fondo ecodesarrollo regi\u00f3n amaz\u00f3nica*\") benchmarks adjusted to reflect the increase in its rate between the two valuation dates. This was done by using a 2006-2007 average of the cost for the October 2007 to June 2010 period and the 2008 cost for the post-July 2010 period.447 The 'harmonised model' used by the Tribunal continues to inflate the benchmark operating costs over time, which is consistent with the expert evidence on this issue.448 It also credits Ecuador with the outstanding AGIP pipeline tariff balance as of October 2007.449 Accordingly, the relevant OPEX benchmarks for Blocks 7 and 21 are shown in the table below. These values are applied to production volumes, where appropriate.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Block 21 | Block 7 |\n| Area Base | Coca- Payamino |\n| **Variable Operating Costs** |  |  |  |\n| $ per Contractor Barrel of Oil |  |  |  |\n| *Amazonian Eco Fund, 2006-07* | $0.49 | $0.60 | $0.52 |\n| *Amazonian Eco Fund, 2008 onwards* | $1.02 | $0.98 | $1.02 |\n| *Other* | $0.87 | $2.33 | $2.24 |\n| $ per Gross Barrel of Oil |  |  |  |\n| *Non-Deductible* | $0.03 | $0.00 | $0.05 |\n| *Deductible* | $0.60 | $1.19 | $1.52 |\n| Total | $0.63 | $1.19 | $1.57 |\n| $ per Barrel of Fluid | $0.43 | $1.27 | $1.62 |\n| **Fixed Operating Costs** |  |  |  |\n| $ per Month | $410,058 | $0 | $408,512 |\n\n  \nNote: Estimated using account information contained in FL13 & JK-49.\n\nSee Exhibit FL13 (Audit Report - *Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Hidrocarburos*).\n\nKalt ER III, paragraph 103; Brattle ER II, paragraphs 225, 230.\n\nBrattle ER III, fn. 232; Brattle Workpapers, Table N; Kalt ER III, paragraph 104; Kalt ER IV, p. 121.\n\n**6. Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)**\n----------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nIn relation to the productions forecasted for Block 7 as set out above, the Oso capital expenditure is based on Mr. Crick's evidence which was utilised by Professor Kalt in his financial model.450 All assumed capital expenditures reflect the same essential build-up of individual per-well and facilities costs reflected in Professor Kalt's first Quantum calculations451 but adjusted to reflect the Tribunal's conclusions that (i) 4 wells would have been drilled by January 2008 and 19 wells drilled between February 2008 to August 2009; and (ii) the starting point for calculations should be on an *ex ante* basis. The relevant capital expenditure is risked to reflect the proved and probable reserves planned.452 The resulting Block 7 expenditures total US$140.8 million.\n\nSee Crick WS II, Appendix C for Block 7's Oso; and Exhibit JK-94 which includes Crick's inputs.\n\nKalt ER III, paragraph 112.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 107.\n\n404.\n\nFor Block 21, capital expenditure is estimated following cost information contained in Mr. Crick's Yuralpa development plan.\n\n405.\n\nMr. Crick's capital expenditure was adjusted to reflect the 16-well programme as found above. According to Mr. Crick's Yuralpa development plan, the timing of fluid handling capital expenditure is tied to when overall fluid rate (oil plus water) approaches predetermined thresholds. The 16-well scenario results in a slower fluid rate increase compared to Mr. Crick's original scenario. This slower fluid rate increase in the 'harmonised model' causes delays for some capital expenditures relative to Mr. Crick's original schedule. Since Mr. Crick considered the first 16 wells in his drilling programme to be 1P wells, risking is not necessary.\n\n406.\n\nFurther, Mr. Crick considered that the water produced in relation to 24 wells would have been limited to 120,000 barrels of water per day (bwpd). Given the number of wells the Tribunal considers would have been drilled, the Tribunal considers that water production would have been limited to 120,000 bwpd, *i.e*. there is no additional water production that needed to be addressed, and therefore there is no need to further adjust for water sensitivities.\n\n407.\n\nThe estimated Block 21 capital expenditures are as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *All values in $ mln* | Capex |\n| ***Block 21*** |  |\n| Oct-07 to Jun-10 | 86.3 |\n| Jul-10 to Jun-21 | 47.8 |\n| **Total** | **134.1** |\n\n**7. Net Present Value of Cash Flows**\n--------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nThe section above sets out the Tribunal's forecasts for productions in Block 7 and 21 over the two periods of time. In relation to the production between October 2007 and June 2010, the Tribunal has priced that production on the basis of *ex ante* expectations in October 2007 of oil prices for each month during this period. Likewise, production from July 2010 onwards was priced at *ex ante* July 2010 expectations for each month after July 2010.\n\n409.\n\nThe cash flows derived from each period are then discounted at a rate of 12% to October 2007 and July 2010, respectively. The discounted cash flows derived for the two periods are then added up.\n\n410.\n\nPrejudgment interest is then added to the net present value as of 2007 and 2010 to bring them forward to the date of the Award. First, monthly yields on 10-year US Treasury notes453 are used as the risk-free benchmark rate. This rate stood at 4.53% in October 2007 and had fallen to 1.75% as of 11 September 2019. Second, in each month between the dates of valuation and the date of the Award, the monthly prejudgment interest amount is computed by applying the monthly interest rate454 to the outstanding damages balance including all accrued prejudgment interest up to the start of that month. Third, different cumulative prejudgment interests are applied which reflects the different time periods over which the prejudgment interest accrues.455\n\nThis is based on actual historical published annualised yield of the 10-year US T-note as reported by the US Federal Reserve and published daily by the US Federal Reserve Board. This historical yield data is contained in Prof. Kalt's Exhibits JK-39 and JK-77C, as well as Brattle Exhibits BR-20 and BR-116. The Tribunal understands that Federal Reserve publishes annualised yields. The experts have consistently used the same series of annualised yields throughout the quantum proceedings. Accordingly, a standard formula has been used to translate the published annual yields to their monthly equivalents: *Monthly rate* = (1 + *Annual yield*) 1/12 -1.  \nThe series has been subsequently updated to include more historical data, and the most recent calculations include accrued prejudgment interest through to September 2016.\n\nSee *ibid*.\n\nThis results in more prejudgment interest for damages relating to the October 2007 damages as opposed to that for 2010.\n\n411.\n\nAccordingly, based on this, the initial amount of damages estimated to be awarded for Block 7 is calculated to be US$145.2 million and the amount of damages to be awarded for Block 21 is calculated to be US$273.7 million, totalling US$418.9 million (as of September 2016). As explained below, certain further adjustments must also be made.\n\n**8. The 'True-Up'**\n--------------------\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal must now consider the implications for the quantum of damages thus far calculated in light of the matters discussed above. First, Perenco had not paid Law 42 dues since 30 April 2008 and accordingly did not actually suffer losses in that respect. Second, where Perenco had paid those dues, there was an 'overpayment' of actual Law 42 dues paid relative to Law 42 dues which should have been paid based on *ex ante* price assumptions. Third, the *coactivas*. Fourth, and relatedly, Petroamazonas had incurred costs in operating the field in Perenco's absence. Fifth, there were termination costs associated with Perenco's exit.\n\n413.\n\nAccordingly, the 'true-up' adjusts the quantum of damages already calculated as follows.\n\n414.\n\nFirst, Ecuador is credited for the amounts of Law 42 dues that Perenco should have paid but did not pay since 30 April 2008 (based on *ex ante* prices).\n\n415.\n\nSecond, Perenco is given credit for the Decree 662 dues that it did pay calculated based on real world prices but which were in excess of Decree 662 dues already accounted for in the 'harmonised' model.\n\n416.\n\nThird, the confluence of events and the Parties' various actions surrounding the *coactivas* has been taken into account.\n\n417.\n\nFourth, Perenco is credited in the 'true-up' for the termination costs that it actually incurred in response to Decree 662.456 Perenco's share of the nominal termination costs is $4 million.457\n\nBased on Kalt ER IV, Exhs. JK-64 and JK-51.\n\nKalt ER IV, Exhibit JK-51.\n\n418.\n\nFifth, based on an *ex ante* analysis, Petroamazonas' costs based on the operating cost benchmarks (as already discussed above) and the barrels forecasted by Mr. Crick for the base wells during the relevant period is US$45.3 million (this is Perenco's share of the costs).\n\n419.\n\nIn light of these factors and the amounts involved, the Tribunal concludes that a fair amount for the 'true-up' should be US$36.4 million (after discounting and bringing forward the relevant cash flows). Thus, the total compensation for Blocks 7 and 21 is reduced by that sum to US$382.5 million.\n\n**9. OCP Deductibility**\n------------------------\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that there should be full tax deductibility in relation to Block 21's OCP ship-or-pay costs. Accordingly, this adds US$9 million to the quantum to be awarded to Perenco. The amount of US$382.5 million is therefore increased by US$9 million to amount to US$391.5 million.\n\n**10. Value of Loss of Opportunity**\n------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal concludes that this should be valued at US$25 million. This sum is added to the amount of US$391.5 million to arrive at a total of US$416.5 million as of September 2016.\n\n**11. Conclusion on Damages in relation to the breach of the Treaty and the Participation Contracts**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nThe sum of US$416.5 million arrived at above is then brought forward to the date of this Award by means of multiplying that sum by an adjustment factor of 1.0776 to arrive at a final figure of US$448,820,400.00. This sum is the damages that are awarded to Perenco and shall be paid by the Respondent, the Republic of Ecuador.\n\n**III. DAMAGES CLAIMED IN RELATION TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL COUNTERCLAIM**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. **Circumstances leading to the appointment of Mr. Scott MacDonald as Independent Expert**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe Tribunal has already adverted to its decision to appoint an Independent Expert if the Parties proved to be unable to settle the environmental counterclaim in light of the findings of fact and law made in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim. By way of introduction to this part of the Award, it warrants repeating why the Tribunal acted as it did.\n\n424.\n\nIn the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, the Tribunal made the following observations:\n\n\"581. The Tribunal has now arrived at the point where it has narrowed the counterclaim on the principal issues of law and fact. The Tribunal has set out the main issues of fact and law which have divided the experts. However, with regard to many of the IEMS/GSI differences, the Tribunal does not feel able to prefer one above the other. It seems to the Tribunal that each was attempting to achieve the best result for the party by whom they were instructed, and that they crossed the boundary between professional objective analysis and party representation. It is clear to the Tribunal that the experts were effectively shooting at different targets and this has made the work of this Tribunal most difficult.\n\n583. The Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence and has found that there are certain issues of fact on which it is extremely difficult for it to make proper determinations. As has been seen, the Tribunal has completely rejected the IEMS' mapping exercise based on background values and has found that the appropriate means for establishing the volume of contaminated soils is delineation. In addition, the Tribunal has rejected certain interpretations of the Ecuadorian regulatory standards applied by IEMS. In applying the proper regulatory standards, the Tribunal finds that the expert evidence from both sides does not provide a sufficient degree of confidence as to the actual conditions in the Blocks. The Tribunal considers that there are too many gaps and conflicts between IEMS' and GSI's evidence on these key issues. For example, GSI did not take samples at all of the sites that IEMS tested; for certain sites where IEMS found contamination, GSI also tested the soil but took samples at different depths, and GSI used \"indicator parameters\" rather than testing comprehensively for all possible oilfield related contaminants. The Tribunal considers that these gaps must be filled and the technical conflicts must be resolved in order to arrive at a fair and proper disposition of Ecuador's counterclaim.\n\n584. In its post-hearing submission, Perenco essentially posited that the Tribunal faces an 'all or nothing' decision:  \nThe various technical issues on which GSI and IEMS so fundamentally disagree are relevant not because the Tribunal should take as its task picking and choosing between the experts on each issue one by one, cafeteria-style, to arrive at some hybrid approach. There is too much interrelationship between the issues to make that kind of exercise productive. Instead, those technical issues are relevant because they provide the basis on which the Tribunal can assess the two approaches, and the basis on which the Tribunal should conclude that GSI's approach is far more reliable and trustworthy than IEMS' approach.\n\n585. While the Tribunal agrees with Perenco that given the present state of the evidence it should not \"take as its task picking and choosing between the experts on each issue one by one, cafeteria-style\" \u2013 because the Tribunal does not possess the requisite technical expertise to decide between experts' disagreements over highly technical issues \u2013 it is equally uncomfortable with simply picking one set of experts' conclusions over the other. The Tribunal well understands that the onus of proof is on a party who makes an allegation and it could be said that because of the doubt in which the Tribunal finds itself Ecuador could be said to have failed in tipping the burden in its favour. However, as the Tribunal is satisfied that there has been some damage for which it seems likely that Perenco is liable, the Tribunal is not disposed to dismiss the counterclaim *in limine*. Given the Constitution's embrace of the importance of the protection of the environment, the most accurate picture of the environmental condition of the Blocks possible \u2013 based on the prior sampling locations of both IEMS and GSI \u2013 must inform the Tribunal's decision on the counterclaim.\n\n586. Accordingly, the Tribunal has concluded that it must require an additional phase of fact-finding in order to arrive at a proper and just conclusion. It is not content to issue a final determination on the extent of Perenco's liability on the basis of the current expert reports.\n\n587. As already intimated, the Tribunal intends to appoint its own independent environmental expert who will be instructed to apply the Tribunal's findings set out above and work with the Tribunal and the Parties to enable the Tribunal to determine the extent of contamination in the Blocks for which compensation is owed.\n\n588. The Tribunal wishes to underscore the fact that the expert chosen to conduct this investigation (after consultation with the Parties to ensure complete independence and impartiality) will be the Tribunal's expert and will be solely answerable to the Tribunal. In due course, the Tribunal will provide a protocol for the expert, setting out the precise questions to be answered in line with the findings made in this Decision. The Parties will be permitted to attend when the expert and his/her team carries out the necessary investigations and the Parties will receive a copy of the expert's report and will be permitted to comment thereon in due course. Naturally, the costs involved in this exercise will initially be borne by the Parties in equal shares with any subsequent allocation of costs to be determined by the Tribunal at the appropriate time.\n\n593. That said, the Tribunal considers it highly desirable for the Parties to take time to properly digest the contents of this Decision and its implications in the overall scheme of things, and they may wish to consider embarking on a mediation process or some other consensual procedure to assist in arriving at a mutually acceptable figure. Having regard to the Tribunal's findings in relation to: (i) background values; (ii) the temporal application of the 2008 Constitution to the facts of this case; (iii) the applicable standards under Ecuadorian law; (iv) the 2008 Constitution's variation of the limitations period; (v) the Tribunal's criticism of the narrowness of GSI's sampling practices; (vi) the Tribunal's rejection of IEMS' mapping and unit costs for remediation; and (vii) the fact the Tribunal will not permit the sampling of areas in the Blocks which were not previously sampled by either party's experts, the Tribunal believes that the remaining issues are most unlikely to lead to an award of damages anywhere near the amount claimed by Ecuador. The Parties will doubtless take all this into account as well as the considerable cost of the further enquiry which the Tribunal considers is absolutely necessary to arrive at a just result in the circumstances of this case in deciding whether it is possible for them to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of this aspect of the dispute.\n\n594. The Tribunal's strong preference and hope is that after receiving this Decision and considering the Tribunal's findings, the legal aspects of the counterclaim will have been sufficiently clarified so as to enable the Parties to agree on a suitable amount of compensation with or without the assistance of an independent expert or a final Tribunal determination. In the event that such an agreement is reached, it will be recorded and included in the Tribunal's Award. If an agreement is not reached, the Tribunal will await the results of its expert's work and make a final decision which will be included in the Award.\"\n\n425.\n\nAs it turned out, the Parties failed to reach an agreement. They then jointly interviewed and agreed on the appointment of Mr. Scott MacDonald as the Independent Expert and the Tribunal accepted their recommendation. Accordingly, Mr. MacDonald was formally appointed as the Independent Expert on 6 July 2016.458\n\nProcedural Order No. 16.\n\n426.\n\nMr. MacDonald directed a team of environmental specialists of Ramboll in the design and conduct of the sampling campaign that the Tribunal contemplated in its Interim Decision on Counterclaim. Under the supervision of the Tribunal, Mr. MacDonald created field sampling protocols and was assisted by Jose Sananes, Clement Ockay, Miles Ingraham, Tais dos Santos, Pablo Yoshikawa, Adrian Gomez, Guillermo Gloria and Aldo Rodriguez (all from Ramboll).459\n\nAnnex 2 to Protocol for the Independent Expert's Second Site Visit to Blocks 7 and 21 dated 27 October 2017.\n\nB. **Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n427.\n\nWhile Mr. MacDonald was reviewing the IEMS and GSI data and was designing his workplan, the *Burlington* proceeding concluded. Accordingly, on 2 March 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on that tribunal's Decision on Reconsideration and Award and its Decision on Counterclaims.\n\n428.\n\nOn 18 April 2017, the Parties filed their comments. On the same date, Perenco also filed its First Dismissal Application.\n\n429.\n\nOn 18 August 2017, following the filing of the Parties' written submissions, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Perenco's First Dismissal Application. It rejected Perenco's First Dismissal Application and reserved costs for future determination.\n\n430.\n\nOn 27 October 2017, the Parties agreed on the Protocol for the Independent Expert's Second Site Visit.\n\n431.\n\nOn 30 January 2018, Perenco submitted a Second Dismissal Application. Perenco also proposed a briefing schedule in its letter accompanying the application and suggested that while the Tribunal considered Perenco's Second Dismissal Application, Mr. MacDonald should suspend work on his report, or complete his report but refrain from submitting it to the Tribunal and the Parties until the Tribunal's decision on the Second Dismissal Application.\n\n432.\n\nOn 31 January 2018, the Tribunal invited Ecuador to reply to Perenco's letter of 30 January 2018. Also, the Tribunal invited the Parties to agree, by 5 February 2018, on the briefing schedule for Perenco's Second Dismissal Application.\n\n433.\n\nOn 5 February 2018, Ecuador replied to Perenco's letter of 30 January 2018 and proposed an alternative briefing schedule for the Second Dismissal Application.\n\n434.\n\nOn 6 February 2018, Perenco requested the Tribunal for leave to reply to Ecuador's letter of 5 February 2018. On the same day, the Tribunal granted Perenco's request to comment on Ecuador's letter of 5 February 2018.\n\n435.\n\nOn 8 February 2018, Perenco replied to Ecuador's letter of 5 February 2018 regarding the schedule and procedure for determining Perenco's Second Dismissal Application.\n\n436.\n\nOn 9 February 2018, Ecuador asked the Tribunal for leave to respond to Perenco's letter of 8 February 2018. On the same day, the Tribunal granted Ecuador's request.\n\n437.\n\nOn 12 February 2018, Ecuador submitted a reply to Perenco's letter of 8 February 2018.\n\n438.\n\nOn 15 February 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would decide the Second Dismissal Application but at the same time Mr. MacDonald's work would continue. His Independent Expert's Report would be submitted to the Parties only if the Tribunal decided to deny Perenco's Second Dismissal Application.\n\n439.\n\nOn 15 March 2018, Ecuador filed its Response to Perenco's Second Dismissal Application.\n\n440.\n\nOn 5 April 2018, Perenco filed its Reply on Perenco's Second Dismissal Application.\n\n441.\n\nOn 26 April 2018, Ecuador filed its Rejoinder on Perenco's Second Dismissal Application.\n\n442.\n\nOn 30 July 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties through a letter from its Secretary that the Tribunal had decided, by a majority, to dismiss Perenco's Second Dismissal Application, and reasons for this decision, as indicated in that letter, are now provided in this Award.\n\n443.\n\nOn 3 October 2018, the Independent Expert informed the Tribunal that he would need additional time to complete his work and submit the Independent Expert Report. No useful purpose would be served by recounting the various exchanges between the Parties and the Tribunal relating to the inevitable delays in the production of what turned out to be a most detailed, useful and comprehensive report.\n\nC. **Perenco's Second Dismissal Application**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n444.\n\nThe Parties' submissions and the Tribunal's reasons for its rejection of Perenco's Second Dismissal Application are set out as follows.\n\n**1. Perenco's Arguments**\n--------------------------\n\n445.\n\nIn its Second Dismissal Application, Perenco argues that \"Ecuador asserted the same counterclaims in both the *Burlington* and *Perenco* arbitrations.\"460 Perenco contends that \"the *Burlington* arbitration has come to a final and irrevocable end, and Ecuador has now received payment of the entire amount due in respect of the counterclaims that it presented to the two tribunals\" in performance of the settlement agreement between Burlington and Ecuador dated 1 December 2017 (the \"**Settlement Agreement**\").461 Perenco submits that Burlington's settlement with Ecuador, and the full payment of the Burlington's and Perenco's joint counterclaims debt, means that Ecuador's counterclaims against Perenco should be dismissed.462\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraph 6.\n\n*Ibid*., paragraph 19 referring to Annex 3, CE-CC-431.\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraph 1*.*\n\n446.\n\nIn its Reply, Perenco disagrees with Ecuador's contention that its Second Dismissal Application is untimely. Perenco contends that its failure to raise *lis pendens* cannot constitute a bar to its application, because \"*lis pendens* is not a proxy for satisfaction of a liability, *res judicata*, mootness, or abuse of process.\"463 According to Perenco, the situation resulting from the *Burlington* award and Burlington's payment would have been the same, \"[e]ven if Perenco had sought, and this Tribunal had granted, a temporary stay based on *lis pendens.*\"464 Perenco further claims that its conduct cannot be construed as a waiver, for it \"cannot conceivably have waived in advance the right to rely on intervening factual circumstances with dispositive effect on the arbitration.\"465 Perenco adds that Ecuador's plea of estoppel cannot succeed in this case, as \"Perenco had no 'contradictory behaviour', and Ecuador did not change its position in detrimental reliance on Perenco's failure to seek a *lis pendens* suspension.\"466\n\nReply, paragraph 9.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 10.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 12.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 13.\n\n447.\n\nIn support of its submission to dismiss Ecuador's counterclaims, Perenco advanced three main arguments:\n\n\"(1) satisfaction of the joint and several counterclaims liability extinguishes Perenco's underlying obligation to Ecuador\u2026; (2) Ecuador's identical counterclaims in these proceedings are moot because there is no dispute for this tribunal to decide; and (3) Ecuador's counterclaims are res judicata because the Burlington CC Decision [i.e. the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims] is no longer subject to any uncertainty, and continuing to litigate them would be an abuse of process.\"467\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraph 20.\n\n448.\n\nPerenco argues that \"Burlington's payment of the Consortium's counterclaims liability satisfies and extinguishes the joint debt so that, as a matter of law, Ecuador cannot continue to pursue Perenco on that debt.\"468 Perenco contends on the basis of the applicable Ecuadorian law that a joint and several liability is extinguished for all of the joint debtors when one debtor satisfies that liability.469 According to Perenco, Ecuador has now received full satisfaction with respect to the counterclaims.470 Relying on Annex 3 of the Settlement Agreement, Perenco alleges that Ecuador \"accepted that the payment represented 'the principal amount and the applicable interest' ordered by the *Burlington* tribunal, that it was paid 'as the full and final settlement of the environment and infrastructure counterclaims presented by Ecuador against Burlington[,]' and that by doing so '*all obligations and liabilities related to the Counterclaims* against Burlington and the Decision on the Counterclaims shall be deemed to have been *irrevocably, fully and finally paid, discharged, and satisfied*.'\"471\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 22.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 23-29.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 30.\n\n*Ibid.* citing Annex 3, Settlement Agreement, CE-CC-431, p. 2, WHEREAS (2) and p. 4, paragraph 2 (emphasis in the original).\n\n449.\n\nPerenco emphasises that Ecuador presented the same claims, obligations and liabilities to both the *Perenco* and *Burlington* tribunals on the basis that Perenco and Burlington were jointly and severally liable.472 Perenco asserts that \"Ecuador has now received what it acknowledges to be full satisfaction of the obligation it asserted against Burlington\" and \"that obligation is necessarily the same as the obligation it asserted against Perenco.\"473 Perenco adds in this respect that the fact \"that the factual records before the *Perenco* and *Burlington* tribunals diverge in some respects does not mean the underlying obligations are legally distinct.\"474 Furthermore, Perenco maintains that Ecuador expressly claimed the total amount of damages from each of Burlington and Perenco and not the aliquot share.475 In addition, Perenco emphasises that \"the possibility that the *Perenco* Tribunal \u2026 might ultimately determine higher or lower quantification of the counterclaims damages is irrelevant\", because \"the obligation on which those damages were premised has been satisfied and extinguished.\"476 Perenco stresses that \"Ecuador has been satisfied not just for the 'amounts' the *Burlington* tribunal calculated, but also for the underlying damage or harm; and not just for the obligations and liabilities the *Burlington* tribunal specified in its Decision on the Counterclaims, but for the counterclaims themselves.\"477\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraphs 33-35; also Reply, paragraphs 17-19.\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraph 36.\n\nReply, paragraph 23.\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraphs 37-40.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 41.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 44 citing Annex 3, CE-CC-431, p. 4, paragraph 2.\n\n450.\n\nIn its Reply, Perenco responds to Ecuador's argument that \"Perenco was not a signatory to the Settlement Agreement and that Burlington's payment can have no effect on Perenco.\"478 Perenco contends that \"the operation of satisfaction as a matter of Ecuadorian law does not depend on, or result from, the content or existence of Annex 3\", because \"the obligation was extinguished through full payment, by operation of law.\"479 In addition to the arguments put forward in its Second Dismissal Application, Perenco alleges that \"[t]here would\u2026be no point in acknowledging that Burlington would seek 'contribution', or in Perenco disclosing the Annex to its Tribunal, if Burlington's payment to Ecuador was just for its own distinct liability.\"480\n\nReply, paragraph 27 referring to Response, paragraphs 95, 97, 100*.*\n\nReply, paragraph 28.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 37 citing Annex 3, CE-CC-431, p. 3, paragraph 5.\n\n451.\n\nAccording to Perenco's interpretation, the provision relied upon by Ecuador \"allows joint debtors to settle their own share of a joint and several liability and provides that such a settlement would be binding between its signatories only.\"481 However, Perenco contests the applicability of this rule in this case in which \"Ecuador did not 'settle' Burlington's aliquot share of the environmental harm with Burlington\", but \"Burlington paid Ecuador\u2026 *full reparation* for the environmental harm claimed against the Consortium.\"482 Perenco asserts that Ecuador \"was prevented [by the Ecuadorian Constitution] from 'settling' with Burlington for anything other than 'full reparation' for the joint and several liability\" allegedly according to Ecuador's own admission.483 Perenco, furthermore, rejects the view that Ecuadorian law does not recognise the notion of mutual representation, pointing in this regard to a provision stipulating that \"by virtue of an agreement, a will or the law, the full debt can be sought from any one of the debtors and by any one of the creditors; in that case, the obligation is *solidaria* or *in solidum*.\"484\n\nReply, paragraph 32 referring to Ecuadorian Civil Code, EL-390, Article 2363.\n\nReply, paragraph 32 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 33.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 34 citing Article 1527, Ecuadorian Civil Code, CA-CC-128.\n\n452.\n\nPerenco maintains that \"the satisfaction of Perenco's and Burlington's counterclaims liability also makes Ecuador's counterclaims in this arbitration moot.\"485 Perenco refers to the case law of the International Court of Justice in which the Court has declined to give judgment in cases where \"circumstances that have since arisen render any adjudication devoid of purpose\", or the \"dispute has disappeared because the object and purpose of the claim has been achieved by other means.\"486 Perenco alleges that this Tribunal recognised mootness as a separate and independent basis on which to dismiss Ecuador's counterclaims, but refrained from doing so because the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims was at the time subject to annulment proceedings.487 Perenco contends that this is not the case any longer as \"[t]here is simply no question about\u2026the final settlement of Ecuador's counterclaims.\"488\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraph 49.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 53 citing *Northern Cameroons, Judgment of 2 December 1963, I.C.J. Reports 1963*, p. 38; *Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment of December 20, 1974, I.C.J. Reports 1974*, pp. 270-271, paragraph 55.\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraphs 49-50 referring to the Tribunal's Decision on Perenco's First Dismissal Application.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 50-52.\n\n453.\n\nPerenco states that the fact that \"Ecuador believes the *Burlington* tribunal should have awarded more damages is not a dispute to be adjudicated.\"489 According to Perenco, \"[m]ootness is assessed objectively as to the dispute, not the particular form of relief ultimately obtained.\"490 In support of this claim, Perenco suggests that in the *Nuclear Tests* cases \"the dispute had disappeared, since the object of the claim had effectively been accomplished by 'other means' than the relief requested.\"491 It also maintains that, in those cases, \"the fact that the *applicants* did not consider the dispute concluded '[did] not prevent the Court from making its own independent finding on the subject.'\"492 Perenco further suggests that the reasoning of the *Orascom* award is instructive for the application of the principle in the investor-State arbitral context.493\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 54.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Ibid.* paragraph 55 citing *Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment of 20 December 1974, I.C.J. Reports 1974*, paragraph 58; *Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment of 20 December 1974, I.C.J. Reports 1974*, paragraph 55.\n\nSecond Dimissal Application, paragraph 55 citing *Nuclear Tests (New Zealand v. France), Judgment of 20 December, 1974, I.C.J. Reports 1974*, paragraph 62; *Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment of 20 December 1974, I.C.J. Reports 1974*, paragraph 59.\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraph 57 referring to *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0.r.l v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, 31 May 2017, paragraphs 488, 492-494, 518-520, 524-526.\n\n454.\n\nIn its Reply, Perenco underlines that the mootness doctrine is not limited only to cases in which the requested relief is specific performance.494 Perenco places particular emphasis on the *Orascom* award. The claimant in that case \"sought damages, not specific performance\" and \"the tribunal nevertheless dismissed the claims\u2026because the 'claims arising from Algeria's measures have ceased to exist due to the settlement agreement' between a claimant-controlled company and Algeria.\"495\n\nReply, paragraph 40 referring to Response, paragraph 95.\n\nReply, paragraph 41 citing *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0.r.l v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, paragraph 524.\n\n455.\n\nPerenco submits that \"Ecuador's counterclaims are also *res judicata* because of the now unequivocal finality of\" the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims.496 Perenco asserts that \"*res judicata* precludes re-litigation of the same dispute\" and \"applies to privies of the parties to the dispute.\"497 Perenco asserts that this Tribunal \"recognized that the *Burlington* Award was formally *res judicata*\", but denied Perenco's First Application \"because of the uncertainty about [its] finality\u2026pending annulment.\"498 It furthermore contends that \"there can be no residual argument that Perenco waived *res judicata* by failing to earlier raise *lis pendens*.\"499\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraph 59.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 60.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 62.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 64.\n\n456.\n\nIn its Reply, Perenco rejects Ecuador's contention that *res judicata* is inapplicable because the party identity requirement is not met.500 Perenco relies on the *Grynberg*, *Apotex III*, and *Ampal-American* awards to argue that \"*res judicata* applies to privies or other stakeholders.\"501 Contrary to Ecuador's allegations, Perenco adds that privity does not require ownership, even if the principle has been applied so far only in the specific context of a shareholder-parent company relationship.502 Perenco asserts that \"privity exists when two entities share an identity of interest that means they equally stand to benefit or suffer economically as a result of an outcome.\"503 According to Perenco, such an identity of interests exists between Perenco and Burlington.504\n\nReply, paragraphs 44 and 46 referring to Response, paragraph 66.\n\nReply, paragraph 45 referring to *Rachel S. Grynberg, Stephen M. Grynberg, Miriam Z. Grynberg and RSM Production Corporation v. Grenada,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, paragraphs 7.1.5 and 7.2.1; *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, 25 August 2014, paragraphs 7.38 and 7.40; *Ampal-American Israel Corp., EGI-Fund (08-10) Investors LLC, EGI-Series Investments LLC, and BSS-EMG Investors LLC v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Award, paragraphs 268-270.\n\nReply, paragraph 47.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 48-50.\n\n457.\n\nPerenco also denies Ecuador's argument that dismissing Ecuador's counterclaims on the grounds of *res judicata* would imply revisiting and reversing the Tribunal's 2015 Interim Decision.505 According to Perenco, \"[t]he Tribunal would not need to incorporate inconsistent findings or in any way prejudice its Interim Decision\", but it would only decide that the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims \"has preclusive effect as of the time it became *res judicata*.\"506\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 51- 52 referring to Response, paragraphs 56-58.\n\nReply, paragraph 52.\n\n458.\n\nPerenco also takes issue with Ecuador's supplementary request to the Tribunal to apply by analogy Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention and analyse evidence that was not taken into consideration by the *Burlington* tribunal.507 Perenco argues that Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allow \"reviving a liability that has already been extinguished\" and, in any case, \"such argument lies before the *Burlington* tribunal, not this one.\"508\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 51 and 53.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 53.\n\n459.\n\nPerenco further contends that \"even if this Tribunal were to find that some formal requirement of the doctrine of *res judicata* is not met, the doctrine of abuse of process would still apply.\"509 According to Perenco, decisions of other tribunals support the view that the doctrine of abuse of process precludes \"pursuing duplicative claims for a dispute that has already been resolved.\"510\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraph 65.\n\n*Ibid.*, citing *Eskosol S.p.A in liquidazione v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Decision on Respondent's Application under Rule 41(5), March 20, 2017, paragraphs 134 and 167; *Ampal-American Israel Corp., EGI-Fund (08-10) Investors LLC, EGI-Series Investments LLC, and BSS-EMG Investors LLC v.

People's Democratic Republic of Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, paragraph 534.\n\n460.\n\nIn its Reply, even though Perenco concedes the point that Ecuador had the right to commence proceedings in multiple *fora*, it stresses that \"it would be an abuse of that right to *continue* to pursue those parallel proceedings after Ecuador has obtained full satisfaction and payment.\"511 Furthermore, it claims that there is no support to Ecuador's argument that \"abuse of process may only occur when multiple proceedings are brought between the *same parties*.\"512 In addition, Perenco maintains that it is not necessary to establish that the \"sole purpose for continuing Ecuador's counterclaims would be to harm Perenco.\"513 Perenco suggests that multiplication of proceedings could also constitute an abuse of process when it is done \"for the purpose of evading a rule of law\" or \"in order to maximize its chances of success.\"514\n\nReply, paragraph 57 (emphasis in the original) referring to Response, paragraph 78.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 59 citing Response, paragraph 78 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 63 citing Response, paragraph 81.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 63.\n\n461.\n\nIn the alternative, if the Tribunal proceeds to the merits of Ecuador's claims, Perenco submits that the Tribunal should \"offset Burlington's entire US$42 million payment against the total amount of any counterclaim damages this Tribunal might find.\"515 According to Perenco, the approach proposed by Ecuador is conceptually inappropriate, because \"the *Burlington* tribunal awarded, and Burlington paid, the total amount of damages for the entirety of the alleged harm.\"516 Moreover, Perenco suggests that the method proposed by Ecuador would lead to double recovery and is technically not feasible.517 In its Reply, Perenco objects to Ecuador's arguments for the same reasons.518\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraph 68.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 70; see also Reply, paragraph 66.\n\nSecond Dismissal Application, paragraphs 73-77.\n\nReply, paragraphs 66-72.\n\n462.\n\nPerenco also rejects Ecuador's objections to its request for an order of the Tribunal that would hold Perenco harmless against any future claims based on alleged environmental and infrastructure liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21.519 Perenco denies that its request would require this Tribunal to assume jurisdiction over third parties or subject-matters not encompassed by Ecuador's counterclaims.520 It also rejects the contention that its request is abusive.521 Contrary to Ecuador's allegation that the request is untimely, Perenco argues that it sought a similar relief in its Rejoinder on the Counterclaims.522 In the alternative, Perenco requests that \"the Tribunal should exercise its discretionary powers under the Arbitration Rules to consider and grant Perenco's request\u2026even if ICSID Rule 40 applies here and somehow makes Perenco's request untimely.\"523\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 73-75 referring to Response, paragraphs 175 *ff*.\n\nReply, paragraph 73.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 74-75.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 76.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n463.\n\nIn its Second Dismissal Application, Perenco seeks an order from the Tribunal:\n\n\"(a) Dismissing Ecuador's counterclaims:\n\n(b) In the alternative:\n\n(i) Deducting US$42,762,619 (the \"Payment) from any damages it may find on Ecuador's counterclaims in this proceeding (the \"Gross Counterclaims Amount\"), including issuing an order for zero damages if the Gross Counterclaims Amount is lower than the Payment, such that any damages Perenco is ordered to pay on Ecuador's counterclaims (the \"Net Counterclaims Amount\") do not exceed the higher of the Payment or the Gross Counterclaims Amount;\n\n(ii) Declaring that Perenco has no further liability with respect to Ecuador's counterclaims beyond the Net Counterclaims Amount;\n\n(iii) Further ordering that Perenco may satisfy the Net Counterclaims Amount by deducting it from the amount that Ecuador owes to Perenco under this Tribunal's final Award;

Ecuador's Arguments**\n--------------------------\n\n465.\n\nEcuador requests the Tribunal to dismiss Perenco's Second Dismissal Application for several reasons.526\n\nResponse, paragraph 48.\n\n466.\n\nEcuador argues that Perenco is barred from relying on its objections, because they are untimely.527 Ecuador maintains that, according to ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1), 26(3) and 27, \"objections shall be made as early as possible; if not, the practice is to dismiss them outright.\"528 Ecuador points out that Perenco should have invoked *lis pendens* when Ecuador first introduced its counterclaims.529 In Ecuador's opinion, the fact that Perenco's objections were presented more than six years after the introduction of Ecuador's counterclaims should be considered a waiver of these objections.530 According to Ecuador, Perenco is also precluded from requesting the dismissal of Ecuador's counterclaims on account of estoppel.531 Ecuador argues that it relied on Perenco's participation in the counterclaims proceedings without raising any objections and, as a result, Ecuador \"invest[ed] considerable time and public funds to establish Perenco's liability in the understanding that it would be adjudicated by this Tribunal.\"532 In its Rejoinder, Ecuador stresses that Perenco's failure to raise *lis pendens*, request a stay of the proceedings or the consolidation of the counterclaims is also abusive.533\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 54.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 55; see also Rejoinder, paragraph 51.\n\nResponse, paragraph 55.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 93; see also Rejoinder, paragraph 52.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 55.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 42-49.\n\n467.\n\nEcuador further contends that Perenco's objections are barred on the ground of *res judicata.* In particular, Ecuador claims that the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims is incompatible with this Tribunal's Interim Decision on Counterclaim in which it made a number of legal and factual determinations on Ecuador's environmental counterclaim and thus constitutes *res judicata*.534 According to Ecuador, \"holding that the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims is *res judicata* would go against the widely established principle that it is the first decision rendered on an issue that is *res judicata*.\"535 Ecuador further observes that these arguments have been espoused by the Tribunal in its previous decisions.536\n\nResponse, paragraph 57; Rejoinder, paragraph 60.\n\nResponse, paragraph 58; also Rejoinder, paragraph 63.\n\nResponse, paragraphs 57-58 citing Decision on Perenco's First Application, paragraphs 36 and 40-42.\n\n468.\n\nEcuador submits that the finality of the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims does not render its counterclaims moot,537 as the requirements of *res judicata* are not met in this case.538 Ecuador concedes that the Tribunal's Decision on Perenco's First Dismissal Application found that that application was premature in light of the then-pending annulment proceedings concerning the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims.539 However, Ecuador stresses that the Tribunal only considered such proceedings \"a bar to a hypothetical argument\u2026which the Tribunal only mentioned without approving it; namely, that the case was moot.\"540\n\nResponse, paragraph 49.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 61.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 50.\n\n*Ibid*., referring to Decision on Perenco's First Dismissal Application, paragraph 46.\n\n469.\n\nEcuador argues that neither Perenco nor the Consortium were parties to the *Burlington* arbitration.541 Ecuador emphasises that Burlington and Perenco are legally and economically independent entities.542 According to Ecuador, \"the party identity requirement is applied strictly under both international law and Ecuadorian law\", so that \"privies in interest cannot be considered the same parties for the purposes of a *res judicata* analysis.\"543\n\nResponse, paragraph 63.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 62.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 66.\n\n470.\n\nEcuador claims in the alternative that Burlington and Perenco are not privies in interest, since \"privity only exists when one party owns the other.\"544 In its Rejoinder, Ecuador emphasises that the three tribunals in *Grynberg*, *Apotex III* and *Ampal-America* \u2013 upon whose decisions Perenco relies \u2013 \"decided to extend the *res judicata* effect to the shareholders on the basis that, as shareholders are entitled to claim for investments held through a corporation under investment law, they must be bound by any previous finding reached in relation to a claim of this corporation on the same facts.\"545 According to Ecuador, this rationale cannot be extended to parties that share the same economic interest in the outcome of a dispute as proposed by Perenco.546\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 67.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 114.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 115-117.\n\n471.\n\nEcuador submits that there is no identity of subject-matter between these proceedings and the *Burlington* proceedings. Ecuador notes in this respect a passage in the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims in which that tribunal indicated that \"*it reache[d] a conclusion different from that of the Perenco tribunal*.\"547 Ecuador observes that there are \"material differences in the evidentiary records before the *Burlington* tribunal and this Tribunal\" consisting of differences \"in the evidence relied upon\" and \"in the witnesses as well as in the questions put to the witnesses and experts during the hearings and the *Burlington* tribunal's site-visit where those experts and witnesses were the same.\"548 Ecuador asserts that \"the different evidentiary record translated, in turn, into radically different approaches by the tribunals.\"549 Ecuador draws the Tribunal's attention, *inter alia*, to the fact that the two tribunals \"adopted distinct approaches as to how the extent of the contamination and the obligation to remediate should be assessed.\"550 It also observes that the *Burlington* tribunal decided to rely on party-appointed experts and a site visit, whereas the present Tribunal decided to appoint its own independent environmental expert.551 In its Rejoinder, Ecuador contends that, contrary to Perenco's claims, \"when two separate tribunals analyze different evidence presented in different manners, they do not consider the same facts and, hence, they decide on different subject-matters.\"552\n\nResponse, paragraph 33 citing *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 69.\n\nResponse, paragraph 69; also *ibid.*, paragraphs 9-47 and Rejoinder, paragraphs 8-34.\n\nResponse, paragraph 23.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 71; see also Rejoinder, paragraph 120.\n\nResponse, paragraph 71.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 125-126 citing *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 14 March 2003, paragraph 432.\n\n472.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal finds that the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims is final and binding in the present proceedings, Ecuador requests the Tribunal to apply by analogy Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention on revision of awards in order \"to pursue its mission and analyze the new evidence before it, which was not taken into consideration by the *Burlington* tribunal when rendering [its] Decision.\"553\n\nResponse, paragraphs 73-75.\n\n473.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Ecuador stresses that the site-specific data and analytical results gathered by Mr. MacDonald constitute a \"new potentially decisive fact.\"554 Ecuador agrees with Perenco that Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention would have entitled the *Burlington* tribunal to revise its Decision on Counterclaims, but this rationale applies *a fortiori* before this Tribunal while this arbitration is still pending.555 Ecuador further argues that it would be entitled to institute proceedings under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention, were this Tribunal to uphold Perenco's Application.556 To this end, Ecuador requests that Mr. MacDonald's Independent Expert Report be communicated to it, even if the Tribunal ultimately accepts Perenco's Application.557\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 137-139.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 140.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 141.\n\n*Id.*\n\n474.\n\nEcuador rejects Perenco's submission that its counterclaims constitute an abuse of process. Ecuador contends that the doctrine of abuse of process is inapplicable in this case for several reasons. First, Perenco should establish that the sole purpose of continuing Ecuador's counterclaims would be to harm Perenco or would be otherwise vexatious which is not the case in the present proceedings.558 Relying on the *Lauder* and *Busta* awards, Ecuador asserts further that pursuing parallel proceedings with a view to maximising its chances of success does not constitute an abuse of process.559 Ecuador adds that the cases cited by Perenco suggest that \"the dispute must be brought by the same claimant against the same respondent\" for an abuse to be found.560 In Ecuador's view, the *Orascom* and *Ampal-American* tribunals deemed that companies at different levels of the same ownership chain were the same party, whereas the *Eskosol* tribunal's approach was even narrower, the tribunal holding that two companies of the same ownership chain were distinct parties.561\n\nResponse, paragraphs 81-82; Rejoinder, paragraphs 104-108.\n\nResponse, paragraphs 83-85 referring to *Lauder v.

Where there are several co-debtors who may have an interest in the settlement, the settlement made by one of them cannot be enforced by or against the others, except where there is novation and the underlying obligation is joint and several.\"574 Ecuador submits that Perenco is not bound by the *Burlington* proceedings nor by the *Burlington* settlement.575 In its Rejoinder, Ecuador adds that the *Burlington* Settlement Agreement cannot benefit Perenco, because \"[f]or a settlement to exist, the parties must make reciprocal concessions.\"576 In particular, Ecuador alleges that \"the set off of the damages awarded against Burlington for the environmental and infrastructure harms\" was part of a larger settlement including a discount to the amount owed by Ecuador as a result of the *Burlington* award and the termination of the *Burlington* proceedings.577\n\nResponse, paragraph 100 citing Article 2363, Ecuadorian Civil Code, EL-390.\n\nResponse, paragraph 97.\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 69.\n\n*Id.*\n\n480.\n\nEcuador also requests the Tribunal to dismiss Perenco's request to offset the entirety of Burlington's payment from any counterclaims' damages awarded by the Tribunal. Whilst Ecuador agrees to avoid double recovery, it maintains that Perenco's approach is flawed.578 According to Ecuador, \"[t]he risk of double recovery can only materialize\u2026if the Tribunal finds exactly the 'same harm' as the one identified and quantified by the *Burlington* tribunal pursuant to its own (different) interpretation of the legal framework and technical methods.\"579 Ecuador suggests that \"'[s]ame loss' (or 'same harm' in the circumstances) requires that both tribunals assess the object of the underlying obligation in an identical manner.\"580\n\nResponse, paragraphs 109-111.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 118.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 117.\n\n481.\n\nEcuador does not dispute that some part of the harm could be the same as that identified by the *Burlington* tribunal, but argues that it remains entitled to claim for \"any\u2026different or additional harm and/or costs with respect to the environment and infrastructure in Blocks 7 and 21.\"581 Ecuador contends that Perenco remains liable for any additional and/or different volumes of soil, mud pits, and groundwater contamination warranting remediation and/or additional remediation costs in Blocks 7 and 21.582 With respect to infrastructure harm, Ecuador claims that Perenco remains liable for any additional item and/or additional cost identified in Blocks 7 and 21.583\n\n*Ibid*., paragraphs 119 and 121.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 122-170.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 171-173.\n\n482.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Ecuador defends the technical feasibility of its approach. It stresses that Perenco did not challenge the feasibility of Ecuador's approach with respect to the infrastructure counterclaim.584 With respect to its environmental counterclaim, Ecuador further argues that its approach can be applied where Mr. MacDonald finds contamination in clearly distinct areas or sites from that identified by the *Burlington* tribunal or where the depth of contamination can be discerned through a comparison between Mr. MacDonald's findings with respect to the contaminated area and the *Burlington* tribunal's findings with respect to the volume to be remediated.585 Ecuador also proposes that in the cases where the exact shape of the contaminated area is not delineated in the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, the Tribunal \"could compare abstract square meters of contamination (not monetary damages) found at the same depth, deduct the overlap, and apply the remediation unit cost estimated by Mr. MacDonald to the balance.\"586\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 150.\n\n*Ibid*., paragraphs 155-156.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 162.\n\n483.\n\nEcuador further requests the Tribunal to reject Perenco's request for an order that \"Ecuador hold Perenco harmless against any future claims based on alleged environmental and infrastructure liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21, before any jurisdiction whatsoever.\"587 Ecuador maintains that this request is unrelated to the application, because \"[w]hether or not Ecuador's counterclaims must be dismissed in the present arbitration does not have any consequences on, or relationships with, potential future claims against Perenco, including by third parties, based on environmental and infrastructure liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21.\"588 Ecuador contends that Perenco is barred for presenting such a request at this phase of the proceedings, since it has not previously sought the authorisation of the Tribunal in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(2).589 Ecuador emphasises that Perenco cannot invoke any special circumstance for its belated presentation of this request for relief.590 It adds that Perenco's request for relief is unfounded, because Ecuador cannot assume responsibility for claims that may arise from third parties.591 For the same reason, Ecuador submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to grant such an order.592 Ecuador argues that this request is also abusive, because it is inconsistent with the other requests formulated in Perenco's Second Dismissal Application.593\n\nResponse, paragraph 175.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 177.\n\n*Id*.\n\nRejoinder, paragraphs 172-173.\n\nResponse, paragraph 178; Rejoinder, paragraphs 179-183.\n\nResponse, paragraph 179.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 180-181.\n\n484.\n\nIn its Response, Ecuador requests the Tribunal to:\n\n\"(a) Dismiss Perenco's Second Application;\n\n(b) Dismiss Perenco's alternative requests for relief;\n\n(c) Dismiss Perenco's request that Ecuador hold Perenco harmless against any future claims based on alleged environmental and infrastructure liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21, before any jurisdiction whatsoever arbitral or judicial, national or international; and\n\n(d) Order Perenco to reimburse Ecuador all the costs and expenses incurred in responding to Perenco's Second Application, with interest.\"594\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 183.\n\n485.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Ecuador amended its request. It requests that the Tribunal:\n\n\"(a) Dismiss Perenco's Second Application;\n\n(b) Dismiss Perenco's alternative requests for relief;\n\n(c) Dismiss Perenco's request that Ecuador hold Perenco harmless against any future claims based on alleged environmental and infrastructure liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21, before any jurisdiction whatsoever arbitral or judicial, national or international;\n\n(d) Communicate Mr. MacDonald's expert report, including its exhibits, appendices and all supporting data (in native format) to the Parties; and\n\n(e) Order Perenco to reimburse Ecuador all the costs and expenses incurred in responding to Perenco's Second Application, with interest.\"595\n\nRejoinder, paragraph 190.\n\n**3. Tribunal's Reasons for Rejecting Perenco's Second Dismissal Application**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n486.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal, by a majority, rejected Perenco's Second Dismissal Application. The reasons are as follows.\n\n487.\n\nThe Second Dismissal Application raises issues of both Ecuadorian and international law. The latter argue in favour of the Tribunal's continuing the counterclaim proceeding. As for the former, a review of the Parties' submissions shows that the position under Ecuadorian law is not as clear-cut as Perenco has contended.\n\n488.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by recalling that it held in the Decision on Reconsideration that its prior decisions are *res judicata* and cannot be re-opened.596 This finding applies with equal force to the Interim Decision on Counterclaim; the Tribunal cannot reopen and reconsider its findings, either explicitly or implicitly.\n\nDecision on Reconsideration, paragraph 43: \"There is ample prior authority in support of the view once the tribunal decides with finality any of the factual or legal questions put to it by the parties, as was the case in the Decision on Liability, such a decision becomes *res judicata*.\"\n\n489.\n\nAmong the Tribunal's (explicit and implicit) findings in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim and the Decision on Perenco's First Dismissal Application were the following:\n\n(a) The Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the counterclaim against Perenco even though a similar counterclaim was on track in the *Burlington* proceeding;597\n\n(b) the counterclaim was not inadmissible;598\n\n(c) the Tribunal decided with finality a number of issues pertaining to the interpretation of the Ecuadorian Constitution and the applicable environmental regulations and recommended that the Parties settle the dispute;599\n\n(d) the Tribunal did not find the expert evidence adduced by both Parties sufficiently reliable and accepted Perenco's argument that it would not be appropriate to 'pick and choose' between the experts in order to fashion relief;600\n\n(e) the Tribunal refused to reject the claim on the basis of a failure to discharge the burden of proof, holding instead that in light of the Constitution's strong interest in environmental protection and in the interest of a just and fair result it would appoint an independent expert if the Parties were unable to negotiate a settlement. The Tribunal stated that it considered such \"further enquiry [to be] absolutely necessary to arrive at a just result in the circumstances of this case\";601\n\n(f) it also explicitly instructed that: \"If an agreement is not reached, the Tribunal will await the results of its expert's work and make a final decision which will be included in the Award\";602 and\n\n(g) finally, the Tribunal stated, without qualification, that the Independent Expert Report would be disclosed to the Parties.603\n\nDecision on Perenco's First Dismissal Application, paragraph 44.\n\n*Id.*, paragraphs 43 and 51.\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 593: \"Having regard to the Tribunal's findings in relation to: (i) background values; (ii) the temporal application of the 2008 Constitution to the facts of this case; (iii) the applicable standards under Ecuadorian law; (iv) the 2008 Constitution's variation of the limitations period; (v) the Tribunal's criticism of the narrowness of GSI's sampling practices; (vi) the Tribunal's rejection of IEMS' mapping and unit costs for remediation; and (vii) the fact the Tribunal will not permit the sampling of areas in the Blocks which were not previously sampled by either party's experts, the Tribunal believes that the remaining issues are most unlikely to lead to an award of damages anywhere near the amount claimed by Ecuador. The Parties will doubtless take all this into account as well as the considerable cost of the further enquiry which the Tribunal considers is absolutely necessary to arrive at a just result in the circumstances of this case in deciding whether it is possible for them to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of this aspect of the dispute.\"\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 585: \"\u2026the Tribunal agrees with Perenco that given the present state of the evidence it should not 'take as its task picking and choosing between the experts on each issue one by one, cafeteria-style' \u2013 because the Tribunal does not possess the requisite technical expertise to decide between experts' disagreements over highly technical issues \u2013 it is equally uncomfortable with simply picking one set of experts' conclusions over the other. The Tribunal well understands that the onus of proof is on a party who makes an allegation and it could be said that because of the doubt in which the Tribunal finds itself Ecuador could be said to have failed in tipping the burden in its favor. However, as the Tribunal is satisfied that there has been some damage for which it seems likely that Perenco is liable, the Tribunal is not disposed to dismiss the counterclaim *in limine*. Given the Constitution's embrace of the importance of the protection of the environment, the most accurate picture of the environmental condition of the Blocks possible \u2013 based on the prior sampling locations of both IEMS and GSI \u2013 must inform the Tribunal's decision on the counterclaim.\"\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 593.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 594.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 20 of the *dispositif* : \"The Tribunal will instruct the expert to move with all deliberate dispatch in order for the expert to be in a position to report back to it in a timely fashion. The Parties shall be given an opportunity to comment on the expert's report prior to the Tribunal's rendering a decision or award on this phase of the proceeding.\" [Emphasis added.]\n\n490.\n\nHaving failed to arrive at a negotiated settlement, the Parties jointly agreed on Mr. MacDonald's suitability as the Independent Expert and the Tribunal accepted their joint proposal. The Tribunal then instructed him on how to conduct his sampling.\n\n*(a) The international law analysis*\n------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it can be seen that the Tribunal faces two *rei judicatae* : (i)) a decision rendered in this proceeding, which on the basis of the logic of the Decision on Reconsideration, and on general principle, is binding on Perenco and Ecuador; and (ii) a decision rendered in a parallel proceeding *after* the present Tribunal rendered its own Interim Decision on Counterclaim (that other decision being binding on Burlington and Ecuador). Perenco now requests that this Tribunal declare that the Ecuador-Burlington settlement following the *Burlington* award is binding upon the Parties to this proceeding. Perenco essentially contends that a *res judicata* created by a different tribunal, after this Tribunal had spoken, which award was subsequently reflected in a settlement between the parties to that dispute, overrides the *res judicata* created by the present Tribunal.\n\n492.\n\nThere are a number of troubling aspects to this argument.\n\n493.\n\nFirst, from the standpoint of an international tribunal's duty to exercise its jurisdiction once established604, it seems counter-intuitive that a tribunal that has made certain findings of law and fact and has decided that a particular course of action must be followed because of the infirmities of the expert evidence before it must be bound by the later finding of another tribunal considering similar issues (based on a different evidential record and in some cases deciding differently from this Tribunal) and which was less troubled by the infirmities in the expert evidence.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003, paragraph 187. *Tokios Tokel\u00e8s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2004, paragraph 36, *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 18 April 2008, paragraph 115.\n\n494.\n\nOne can reasonably ask why the *res judicata* represented by the Interim Decision on Counterclaim of this Tribunal must yield to the *res judicata* of a later-in-time decision rendered by another tribunal that chose a different means of estimating the damage suffered by Ecuador (and which, when rendering its award, declined to give effect to this Tribunal's prior decision).\n\n495.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal sees the force in Ecuador's argument that given the procedure which the Tribunal previously laid down and which was being followed in the present case, were the Tribunal to accept the *Burlington* award as being a final disposition of the counterclaim, it would essentially be re-opening its Interim Decision on Counterclaim and grafting on to it reasons and findings made by another tribunal which are inconsistent with this Tribunal's own prior findings.605\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 581: \"The Tribunal has set out the main issues of fact and law which have divided the experts. However, with regard to many of the IEMS/GSI differences, the Tribunal does not feel able to prefer one above the other. It seems to the Tribunal that each was attempting to achieve the best result for the party by whom they were instructed, and that they crossed the boundary between professional objective analysis and party representation. It is clear to the Tribunal that the experts were effectively shooting at different targets and this has made the work of this Tribunal most difficult.\" [Emphasis added.]\n\n496.\n\nThus, from the perspective of a de-centralised international legal regime in which investment treaties confer jurisdiction over *ad hoc* tribunals which in turn have jurisdiction only over the parties to the disputes brought before them, and where it is accepted that different tribunals considering similar matters can arrive at different conclusions, in the Tribunal's view, by the time of Perenco's Second Dismissal Application it was far too late to turn off the process which the Tribunal had ordered to be conducted and which was nearing its completion.\n\n497.\n\nThird, the only party which has sought to treat the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaim as having *res judicata* and preclusive effect on the continued prosecution of the present counterclaim is Perenco. Likewise, the only party that characterises the *Burlington* Settlement Agreement as bringing the environmental and infrastructure counterclaims to an end is Perenco, a non-party to that agreement. The 2011 agreement on the counterclaim between Burlington and Ecuador, the *Burlington* Decision, and the Burlington-Ecuador Settlement Agreement do not purport to hold that the Consortium's liability was definitively and finally determined by that tribunal's decision.\n\n*(b) Ecuadorian law on the effect of the Settlement Agreement and Annex 3 on Perenco's liability*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n498.\n\nThe Ecuadorian law issue concerns the effect of the Ecuador-Burlington Settlement Agreement and its Annex 3 on Perenco's liability to Ecuador under Ecuadorian law.\n\n499.\n\nThe stated purpose of Annex 3 to the Settlement Agreement was to amongst other things ensure that Ecuador does not receive double recovery for the same damage/harm through the counterclaims against Perenco in the *Perenco* arbitration. The Settlement Agreement also explicitly contemplated certain relationships between the Burlington settlement and the ongoing *Perenco* arbitration and the implications of the former for the latter.\n\n500.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Settlement Agreement shows that the parties thereto did not intend for that agreement to affect the prosecution of the *Perenco* environmental counterclaim, except to the extent that Burlington secured Ecuador's agreement not to pursue it for additional damages and not to seek double recovery for those damages which were paid pursuant to the Agreement.\n\n501.\n\nThe \"fairness\" argument advanced by Perenco, namely, that Burlington would not have truly achieved a \"full and final settlement and release\" from the counterclaims because it continues to bear exposure to damages on the counterclaims if this Tribunal were to order a larger quantum of damages, is undermined by the fact that no attempt was made by Burlington or Ecuador to vary Burlington's JOAs with Perenco. Without Perenco's consent, it was not open to the other two parties to attempt to change the terms of the JOAs, specifically the contribution provision. Perenco therefore stands in the same position now as it was in before the Burlington-Ecuador settlement, namely, Perenco has the contractual right to call upon Burlington to assume its aliquot share of any damages ultimately awarded by this Tribunal.\n\n502.\n\nWhile Perenco relies on its joint and several liability with Burlington to argue that the Settlement Agreement discharges its own liability, it appears that under Article 2363 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, Perenco cannot enforce the Settlement Agreement against Ecuador. That article reads:\n\n\"A settlement is binding between its signatories only. Where there are several who may have an interest in the settlement, the settlement made by one of them cannot be enforced by or against the others, except where there is a novation and the underlying obligation is joint and several.\"606\n\nEL-390.\n\n503.\n\nEcuador explains that, by virtue of this provision, the civil law notion of mutual representation does not apply. This means that a debtor (*i.e.* Perenco) would be not able to rely on a settlement entered into by the creditor with another co-debtor (*i.e.* Burlington). The Settlement Agreement is binding between Ecuador and Burlington only.\n\n504.\n\nPerenco seeks to read Article 2363 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code restrictively. It appears to argue that the provision only addresses situations where joint debtors to settle *their own share* of a joint and several liability and provides that such a settlement would be binding between its signatories only.607 It therefore argues that the provision is inapplicable here because Ecuador did not settle Burlington's aliquot share of the environmental harm with Ecuador. Rather, Burlington paid Ecuador full reparation for the environmental harm Ecuador claimed against the Consortium. In this regard, Perenco relies on (in addition to its own pleadings in relation to its First Dismissal Application and the Second Dismissal Application) the recitals in the Settlement Agreement and the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims.608\n\nReply, paragraph 32.\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 1099.\n\n505.\n\nPerenco's argument can be addressed on two levels: first, whether Burlington and Ecuador settled the whole of the Consortium's joint and several liability in such a way as to bind Ecuador towards Perenco under Article 2363 of the Civil Code; and second, whether as a matter of Ecuadorian law, Article 2363 of the Civil Code operates in the way that Perenco contends. With respect to the first issue, the Tribunal considers that it is addressed by the language in the Settlement Agreement which discusses the limits of that agreement, its relationship to the *dispositif* of the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, and that award's relationship in turn to the ongoing *Perenco* arbitration.\n\n506.\n\nWhile it is indeed the case that Ecuador was making \"*a full claim for the alleged environmental harm in each of the Burlington and Perenco cases*\", the *Burlington* tribunal clearly contemplated that the present Tribunal could come to a different conclusion on the quantum of damages and left it to this Tribunal to fashion its decision to prevent double recovery by Ecuador. The Settlement Agreement itself recognises this state of affairs.\n\n507.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the parties to the Settlement Agreement intended that the *Burlington* decision was determinative of the liability owed by Burlington to Ecuador, but *not* determinative of the entirety of the environmental harm caused to Ecuador more generally.\n\n508.\n\nThis appears to accord with the notion of tortious liability in the Ecuadorian civil law system. In this regard, the Tribunal accepts Ecuador's submission that the notion of tortious liability in the civil law system is significantly different from that in the common-law system. Unlike the common law, which looks for the existence of a relationship between the tortfeasor and the victim (such as to establish the existence of a duty of care, breach of which leads to liability), the civil law system is more concerned with whether damage has been caused by a person's act(s). If damage occurs, tortious liability follows (without any inquiry as to whether the parties were in a particular relationship such that tortious liability could arise). Thus, Ecuador's explanation, which emphasises the civil law's preoccupation with the occurrence of damage, supports the Tribunal's continued determination of the full extent of the contamination (subject, of course, to the restrictions laid down for the work of the Independent Expert). Ecuador has argued that the *Burlington* tribunal almost certainly did not accurately estimate the extent of the contamination. (As shall be seen, the expert opinion of Mr. MacDonald supports this view.) Given that situation, a failure to properly estimate the damage would mean that the victim of the tortious conduct would be under-compensated.\n\n509.\n\nThe Tribunal considers further that the *Burlington* tribunal, comprising three distinguished civil law-trained arbitrators, could be taken to be familiar with the civil law system's approach towards tortious liability. The members of that tribunal did not evince any concern in proceeding independently to decide the *Burlington* counterclaim even though their decision was rendered after this Tribunal's Interim Decision on Counterclaim, and despite the fact that the Consortium operator (Perenco) was not before them. Moreover, instead of declaring that they were determining the whole of the Consortium's liability, the *Burlington* tribunal explicitly left it to the present tribunal to address any risk of double recovery:\n\n\"69. The Tribunal is mindful of the separate nature of the two arbitrations and of its duty to resolve the dispute before it solely on its own record and merits. This said, the Tribunal is also mindful of the risk of double recovery, to which it will revert, and of the potential risk of contradictory decisions. For reasons linked to the value of coherence of the legal system, it considers that contradictory decisions on identical issues should be avoided to the degree possible without sacrificing any party's rights of due process or fairness. While ruling on the basis of the record in this case exclusively, the Tribunal will refer to the *Perenco* Decision in those instances where, in spite of the desire to avoid contradictions, it reaches a conclusion different from that of the *Perenco* tribunal.\n\n70. As regards the risk of double recovery (item (iv) above), Ecuador does not dispute that it seeks what Burlington calls \"identical overlapping compensation with regard to the same alleged damage\" in both proceedings. It also agrees that there is a risk of double recovery. This being so, at the end of the Hearing, Ecuador explained that it does not intend to recover its claimed damages twice, but that it will rely on whichever decision proves to be more favorable to its position. Burlington, on its part, requested that the Tribunal expressly address the risk of double recovery, such that \"if the dispositive part of either of the awards on counterclaims provides for any compensation, Ecuador would be prevented from enforcing the second award to the extent that it has already been compensated by the first\". The Tribunal addresses double recovery below (Section D).\"609 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 69-70.\n\n510.\n\nTherefore, based on the above, the Tribunal finds that the Settlement Agreement could only have been intended to settle what the *Burlington* tribunal thought was the damage suffered by Ecuador (subject to intra-Consortium claims under the JOAs which apply as between the two Consortium partners and, crucially, subject to what this Tribunal would decide).\n\n511.\n\nTurning to the second issue, it is difficult to read Article 2363 in the manner which Perenco contends when the provision does not state that it applies only to partial settlements. In any event, the fact of the settlement by one party that is jointly and severally liable with one or more others does not in and of itself permit a non-settling party to plead the settlement. By its own terms, Article 2363 requires not only a relationship of joint and several liability, but also a novation of the settlement agreement. Thus, on a plain reading of that provision, Perenco can claim the benefit of Settlement Agreement *only if* there has been a novation *and* the underlying liability is joint and several.610 There is no allegation that the Ecuador-Burlington Settlement Agreement has been novated to the benefit of Perenco. Indeed, the terms of the Settlement Agreement are explicitly to the contrary in that the rights and benefits of the settlement are expressly limited to the parties thereto.\n\nResponse, paragraph 100.\n\n512.\n\nFinally, the *Burlington* tribunal expressly recognised \"its duty to resolve the dispute before it solely on its own record and merits\" while the *Perenco* proceeding continued.611 This point, with which the Tribunal agrees, has particular salience because of the fundamentally different approaches taken by the two tribunals on the environmental counterclaim. The *Burlington* tribunal decided to conduct a site visit and to rely upon the expert evidence of IEMS and GSI, picking and choosing between their respective findings on individual items. This Tribunal believes that its Independent Expert is in a better position to provide a more technically-sound and more rigorous evaluation of the conditions in the sites than what can be obtained through a site visit. Nor was it willing to rely upon the reports produced by the Parties' experts without their data and findings being evaluated and confirmed (or not) by an independent expert.\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 69.\n\n513.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal has dismissed Perenco's Second Dismissal Application612 and it now turns to the work of the Independent Expert.\n\nMr. Kaplan cannot agree with the majority on this conclusion. He considers that on its true interpretation the Settlement Agreement between Burlington and Ecuador releases the other co-contractor, namely Perenco.\n\nD. **The Independent Expert's Work**\n------------------------------------\n\n**1. Mr. MacDonald's Qualifications**\n-------------------------------------\n\n514.\n\nThe Tribunal noted above at paragraph 47 that after the Parties were unable to negotiate a settlement of the environmental counterclaim, they jointly agreed on the appointment of Mr. Scott MacDonald as the Tribunal's Independent Expert. Mr. MacDonald's qualifications are set out in his Independent Expert's Report and they are not repeated here. Suffice to say that he has some 30 years of experience in advising corporate clients, conducting risk-based multimedia investigations and remediation under various federal, state and local regulatory programmes on a global basis; performing different types of environmental assessments, and providing expert witness testimony in litigations and arbitrations on, among other things, the performance or non-performance of environmental obligations, defences against claims for primary restoration and compensatory damages for groundwater in natural resource damages litigation; private-party cost-recovery actions as related to the source, distribution, and fate of soil sediment and groundwater contamination; underground storage tanks; cost recovery actions under US legislation, and insurance coverage disputes. Much of his work has involved the oil sector.613 Finally, although he had not previously worked in Ecuador, Mr. MacDonald has experience working throughout much of Latin America.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 2.\n\n**2. Scope of the Independent Expert Report**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n515.\n\nOn 19 December 2018, Mr. MacDonald issued his Independent Expert Report. He confirmed that he was and remained independent of the Parties and also confirmed that the scope of his work was bound by the Tribunal's Interim Decision on Counterclaim.614\n\n*Id.*\n\n516.\n\nThe following partial summary of the Independent Expert Report is included to set out the Independent Expert's description of his work, his findings, and prescriptions for remediation so as to provide the requisite context for the Tribunal's discussion of the Parties' comments and criticisms of the Independent Expert Report and the Tribunal's findings thereon. The following summary of the Independent Expert Report is merely that; no inference should be drawn from the Tribunal's attempt to extract and reproduce here what it considers to be the most salient points made by the Independent Expert. The Report stands as a whole and is the authoritative statement of the Independent Expert's views, as supplemented by his presentation and testimony given during the course of the Expert Hearing.\n\n517.\n\nMr. MacDonald began by describing his mandate as to resolve certain key issues bearing on the extent, if any, of compensable environmental contamination in Blocks 7 and 21 as determined in accordance with the Tribunal's findings set out in its Interim Decision on Counterclaim and the Tribunal's clarifications of his mandate.\n\n518.\n\nIn order to do so, he first reviewed what the Parties' experts had done, identified what he considered to be significant data gaps that required resolution, and to the extent that he found contamination in the sampling conducted at sites that had previously been identified by one or both of the Parties' experts as being contaminated, estimated the remediation cost based on the Tribunal's finding that in-country cost estimates should be employed.615 His Independent Expert Report describes the documentary material provided to him by the Tribunal and the Parties.616 This was supplemented by visits to representative sites during November 2016 and again during field work performed in the fall of 2017.617 Finally, under his direction, Ramboll generated independent data and analyses to close significant data gaps in the investigation of soils, and generated a technically valid data set to replace prior groundwater data gathered by the Parties. Ramboll also conducted work needed to document the compliance status of mud pits previously used by Perenco with applicable Ecuadorian regulations.618 Mr. MacDonald described how his samples were taken, how they were handled, and where they were shipped in order to be analysed by a qualified laboratory.619\n\nSection 1.3 of the Independent Expert Report, p. 2.\n\nListed at Section 8.0 of the Independent Expert Report.\n\nSection 1.5 of the Independent Expert Report, p. 4.\n\nSection 1.3 of the Independent Expert Report, p. 2.\n\nAppendices D and E to the Independent Expert Report.\n\n519.\n\nMr. MacDonald stated that his intent was to supplement the existing work performed by the Parties' experts in conservative compliance with Ecuador's laws and regulations so as to establish a more reliable technical platform to support the Tribunal's decision in this matter.620 As instructed by the Tribunal, his technical work was limited to:621\n\n(a) Investigation at sites at which: (i) soil contamination was identified by one or both Parties above applicable Ecuador regulatory remediation criteria; (ii) groundwater was previously investigated by the Parties; and (iii) mud pits determined to have been used by Perenco were present;\n\n(b) For soils, investigation was limited to areas previously assessed by one or both Parties, where existing data were insufficient to develop a technically valid remediation cost estimate;\n\n(c) For groundwater, investigation was limited to sites where groundwater sampling had previously been conducted by the Parties, but where more technically sound investigation methodologies were needed. Mr. MacDonald's work was intended to confirm the presence or absence of groundwater contamination at these sites utilising more advanced and accepted well installation and sampling methods. The delineation of groundwater contamination was not requested by the Tribunal and was outside the scope of this effort; and\n\n(d) For mud pits, investigation was limited to mud pits that were determined to have been used during Perenco's operations.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 5.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 4.\n\n520.\n\nMr. MacDonald considered that his work was sufficient to significantly narrow the range of potential environmental cleanup costs at the site. While some uncertainties remained, he stated that he had sought to reduce the degree of these uncertainties.622 He considered that his engineering cost estimates are both locally implementable and technically viable.\n\n*Id.*\n\n521.\n\nThe Independent Expert Report was transmitted to the Parties for their review and comment. The paragraphs that follow are intended to provide a summary of the points made in the Independent Expert Report.\n\n**3. Assessment of Baseline Information**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n522.\n\nMr. MacDonald confirmed the Tribunal's view that despite the work conducted by the Parties' experts, considerable uncertainty regarding site conditions remained, and in his opinion, this was largely attributable to the differing philosophical purposes of the experts' work as well as their technical approaches to obtaining and processing data. His Independent Expert Report identified the most significant issues as follows.\n\n523.\n\nThe Parties' experts took different approaches to their analyses. In his view, IEMS attempted to mirror what he called an \"ASTM-type due diligence process\", through which potential areas of environmental concern could be identified by means of reviewing documentation provided by the Parties or other sources of information; interviews with representatives of the Parties, site personnel with knowledge of historical site activities (currently with Petroamazonas) and local community members; and site inspections. Follow-up sampling was conducted in selected areas to assess whether contamination was present in areas previously identified as RECs.623 Where it did identify contamination (defined by IEMS as being above its base values), modeling of the data gathered via the IDW method was then conducted to derive an estimate the extent of contamination.624\n\nASTM (E 1527-05, as cited by IEMS) defines a REC as \"*The presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products on a property under conditions that indicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products into structures on the property or into the ground, ground water, or surface water of the property. The term includes hazardous substances or petroleum products even under conditions in compliance with laws. The term is not intended to include de minimis conditions that generally do not present a threat to human health or the environment and that generally would not be the subject of an enforcement action if brought to the attention of appropriate governmental agencies. Conditions determined to be de minimis are not recognized environmental conditions.\"*\n\nIndependent Expert Report, pp. 32-33.\n\n524.\n\nGSI's work, on the other hand, was intended to test the validity of IEMS' findings. GSI conducted its own site inspections to confirm and/or identify new areas of potential impact, conducted further characterisation activities with respect to ground water, and used soil contamination delineation techniques, as well as human health risk assessment tools, to evaluate IEMS' findings. GSI's efforts were, in Mr. MacDonald's view, more like a remedial investigation, in which delineation of limited and previously identified areas of contamination was conducted.\n\n525.\n\nMr. MacDonald concluded that in the case of both experts, the \"technical choices made by the Parties, intended or not, embedded biases within their findings\":625 IEMS significantly overestimated actual contamination at the sites while GSI underestimated it.626 This accorded with the Tribunal's own view expressed in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 11.\n\n*Ibid.*, pp. 11 & 12.\n\n526.\n\nThis resulted in incomplete site characterisation as well as radically different conclusions. Mr. MacDonald discussed how this affected the experts': (i) site investigation practices (discussed in the Report at Section 2.5.2); (ii) data evaluation techniques (discussed in the Report at Section 2.5.4); and (iii) cost estimation approaches (discussed in the Report at Section 2.5.5).\n\n527.\n\nIn order to evaluate these methods and the results that they generated, Mr. MacDonald reviewed the Tribunal's Interim Decision on Counterclaim and distilled the key findings which bore on the applicable Ecuadorian environmental standards to be applied. His summary of the relevant findings is contained in his Independent Expert Report at Section 3.\n\n528.\n\nHe also took note of the Tribunal's findings on the changes effected to the Ecuadorian legal regime insofar as the Constitution's changes to the fault-based liability regime was concerned.627\n\n*Ibid.*, point 5 of Section 1.6.1.\n\n**4. The Land Use Issue**\n-------------------------\n\n529.\n\nMr. MacDonald noted that the Tribunal rejected Ecuador's assertion that natural background conditions were required to be met as a remediation objective at the sites and therefore provided direction on which numerical criteria should be applied. In the case of soils, such criteria depend on the land use of the area being evaluated. The basis for determining land use and the criteria used to classify land use are described below.\n\n*(a) Land Use Designations*\n---------------------------\n\n530.\n\nNeither RAOHE nor TULAS provided clear guidance as how best to identify the applicable land use criteria for any particular site. GSI evaluated 20 remediation projects at oil fields in the Oriente operated by Petroecuador, Petroproducci\u00f3n, and other operators, which showed that in 80-90% of cases reviewed, the agricultural land use criteria were generally applied.628\n\n*Ibid.*, fn. 112.\n\n531.\n\nGSI considered that IEMS had applied the 'sensitive ecosystem' criteria too broadly. RAOHE defines the sensitive ecosystem criteria as \"*maximum permitted concentrations aimed for the protection of sensitive ecosystems such as National Heritage Natural Protected Areas and other identified in the corresponding site-specific Environmental Assessment*.\" These are further described as follows:\n\n(i) **National Heritage Natural Protected Areas** \u2013 Under Articles 66 and 67 of the Forest and Natural Areas and Wildlife Conservation Law or \"LFCANVS\" *(Ley Forestal y de Conservaci\u00f3n de Areas Naturales y Vida Silvestre)* certain areas are expressly designated and mapped for protection due to their flora and fauna or their constituting ecosystems that contribute to the maintenance of ecological equilibrium.629 Boundaries for these protected areas include or are in the immediate vicinity of the Payamino 1/CPF, Payamino 2/8, Payamino 4 and 14/20/24, Payamino 18, Payamino 19, Payamino 23, Waponi-Ocatoe, and Nemoca platforms.630\n\n(ii) **Environmental Assessment \u2013** Under RAOHE, Article 33, indicates that Environmental Impact Assessments (EIS) may include *inter alia* an Environmental Diagnosis \u2013 Base Line *(Estudio de Impacto Ambiental inclusive el Diagn\u00f3stico Ambiental - L\u00ednea Base)*, which is defined under the Environmental Management Law *(Ley de Gesti\u00f3n Ambiental* as a technical administrative procedure which seeks to determine beforehand the environmental viability of a project, construction activity, or private or public activity.\n\n*Ibid.*, fn. 113: http://www.ambiente.gob.ec/areas-protegidas-3/.\n\n*Ibid.*, fn. 114: IDEC paragraph 494 and GSI ER I Appendices L.23, L.26, and L.29.\n\n532.\n\nPursuant to RAOHE Article 3.1, the Environmental Diagnosis \u2013 Base Line, where available, would be an appropriate resource to identify site-specific sensitive areas. Article 41, section 3.2.2, of the RAOHE requires the identification of land ecosystems, vegetative cover, flora and fauna, aquatic or marine ecosystems, sensitive areas, unique flora and fauna specimens, endangered or in danger species, and potential threats to the ecosystem. No further guidance is provided regarding sensitive ecosystems.631\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 37.\n\n*(b) Selected Criteria for Classifying Land Use*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n533.\n\nMr. MacDonald found that for most of the subject sites, baseline assessments were either unavailable or did not provide sufficient information to determine whether the site was located in a sensitive ecosystem.632 He took note of the Tribunal's finding that, given the importance of the rainforest ecosystem, one should err on the side of the most protective criteria.633 For purposes of evaluating sampling results, he therefore applied the following guidelines:\n\n(a) The land uses identified within the Interim Decision on Counterclaim and documents provided by the Parties were reviewed. In most cases, Ramboll's observations were generally consistent with those of the Parties. Ramboll relied on its own observations rather than documentation presented by others; however, Mr. MacDonald stated, in no case was a conflict between Ramboll's observations and the determination of an Ecuadorian authority identified.\n\n(b) Industrial criteria applied within the boundaries of existing platforms or CPFs that contain processing equipment, operating wells, or dormant wells that could be returned to service. Operating areas containing other in-use infrastructure (such as waste transfer stations, soil treatment areas, power oil pumping stations) were also considered to be industrial. The areas of these platforms are generally defined by fencing and/or perimeter collection trenches.\n\n(c) Soils that are not situated on platforms were considered to be potentially accessible to the public, livestock, and wildlife. Such areas were therefore subject to more stringent, non-industrial criteria (*i.e*., sensitive ecosystem/ residential or agricultural). For mud pits located outside of the platform limits, the upper 30 centimeters of material were assumed to be bio-available and considered to have the same land uses as neighboring soils. Commercial criteria were generally not applicable to the sites and are not considered in his work.\n\n(d) Agricultural criteria would apply within cleared areas, open pastures, or areas that were under active cultivation. The agricultural criteria would also apply to areas clearly used for animal grazing.\n\n(e) Residential and sensitive ecosystem criteria would apply to all other lands, including:\n\n(i) Designated parks and preservation lands;\n\n(ii) Residential properties;\n\n(iii) Primary forests, secondary forests, and open pastures that do not appear to be heavily used by livestock;\n\n(iv) Formerly cultivated lands that are fallow, or lands that contain both native and infilled crops, and/or native plants that are harvested; and\n\n(v) Former platforms that have been abandoned or are designated for closure.634\n\n*Id.*\n\nIDEC, paragraph 495.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 38.\n\n534.\n\nThe very broad applicability of the sensitive ecosystem criteria was intended to best facilitate restoration of lands that might have been affected by oil extraction activities, but are protected under Ecuador's 2008 Constitution. This application also was also considered to be responsive to the local residents' dependency upon the natural environment for food.\n\n535.\n\nWhere individual parameters were found naturally at concentrations exceeding the most stringent applicable criteria (either agricultural or sensitive ecosystem/residential), then in accordance with Ecuador's regulations, the \"background criteria\" would apply (see the further discussion in Section 3.1.2.1 and Appendix C to the Tribunal's Independent Expert Report).635\n\n*Id*.\n\n**5. Remediation Standards**\n----------------------------\n\n536.\n\nThe remediation standards applicable to soil, mud pits and groundwater are defined in TULAS and RAOHE. In the case of soils, published remediation criteria are defined based on the specific land use of the area investigated and consider the development of background criteria where baseline conditions indicate the natural presence of regulated constituents above the published criteria. The numerical criteria for all media are described at Section 3.2 of the Independent Expert Report.636\n\nSee Independent Expert Report, Table 3.1 for soils, Table 3.2 for mud pits, and Table 3.3 for groundwater.\n\n**6. Selection of Analytical Parameters**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n537.\n\nBased on the findings from the prior work, as well as the analytical suite of parameters chosen by Ecuador's own consulting team,637 the compounds assessed by Mr. MacDonald in the Blocks are set out in Table 3.4 of his Independent Expert Report:638\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table 3.4: Selected Contaminants of Concern** |\n| Analyte | Soils | Mud | Groundwater | Notes |\n| TPH | X | X | X | TPH represented by the sum of GRO, DRO and MRO (see Section 3.1.6). |\n| PAHs | - | X | - | PAHs were initially evaluated by the Parties in soils and groundwater but were not found at levels of concern and were omitted from later work. |\n| Barium | X | X | X | Ba was evaluated by the Parties in all media. |\n| Cadmium | X | X | X | Cd was evaluated by the Parties in all media. |\n| Chromium | X | X | X | Cr had been initially evaluated by the Parties in soil but did not carry forward in subsequent phases of investigation because \"no relevant concentrations of such component were detected.\" However, Cr was retained because it is a compound required for leachability testing in the mud pits, was included in the original suite of groundwater constituents analyzed by the Parties, and had been found above applicable numerical remediation standards in multiple soil samples. |\n| Copper | - | - | X | Cu was not tested by the Parties in soils and is not required in RAOHE for mud pit materials but was analyzed by the Parties in groundwater. |\n| Lead | X | - | X | Pb is not required in RAOHE for mud pit materials. |\n| Nickel | X | - | X | Ni is not required in RAOHE for mud pit materials. |\n| Vanadium | X | X | - | V was not assessed in groundwater because there is no corresponding groundwater or drinking water standard, nor did the Parties test for this metal in their groundwater work. |\n| Conductivity | - | X | X | Soil conductivity and pH were not retained for soils because these are indicator parameters only. |\n| pH | - | X | - |\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 44 & fn. 123, referring to IEMS, 2011, p. 31.\n\n*Ibid.*, pp. 44-45.\n\n*(a) Indicator Parameters*\n--------------------------\n\n538.\n\nEarlier in the proceeding, Perenco's expert, GSI, contended that the only reliable parameters that could be used to assess the impact of oilfield operations are TPH (crude oil), barium (drilling mud), and soil electrical conductivity (produced water). *\"The presence of other chemicals in the soil, in the absence of a primary indicator (e.g. nickel in the absence of elevated barium or TPH) cannot be caused by an oil field material and was therefore not retained for further investigation.*\"639 GSI's contaminant delineation methodology reflected this opinion; heavy metals that were not also found in the presence of an indicator compound were not identified as contaminants requiring further delineation and/or remedy and were not investigated.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 45 & fn. 124, referring to the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 242.\n\n539.\n\nIn Mr. MacDonald's view, TPH, barium, and conductivity are useful indicators that, where elevated, suggest a potential impact on the environment resulting from petroleum operations. However, heavy metals may also be associated with well drilling operations, crude oil extraction and/or with formation water management. While Perenco asserted that its formation waters were reinjected, the potential exists for this material to have been discharged during its storage, conveyance and management. Therefore, the presence of heavy metals in soils at levels above background due to petroleum operations could not be entirely discounted. That said, where metals were found in absence of barium or TPH, special attention was considered to be merited to assess whether the detections are more likely to be attributable to oilfield activities or to natural background conditions.640\n\n*Ibid.*, pp. 45-46.\n\n*(b) Conductivity and pH*\n-------------------------\n\n540.\n\nMr. MacDonald concurred with IEMS and GSI that there was limited utility in using conductivity or pH as parameters to determine the presence or extent of contaminated soils. Electrical conductivity and pH were included in the assessment of mud pit materials (as required by RAOHE).641\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 46.\n\n**7. Analyses**\n---------------\n\n*(a) Laboratory and Method Selection*\n-------------------------------------\n\n541.\n\nMr. MacDonald explained that selecting a laboratory for this project was challenging due to the limited availability of an adequate local facility that could complete all necessary tests, and which was also satisfactory to both Parties. In the end, ALS Environmental, based in Houston, Texas, was chosen based on its certifications, its having an office in Ecuador that could support sample handling and management, and its ability to manage the transport of the samples from the sites to its laboratory in Houston.\n\n542.\n\nMr. MacDonald sought to ensure that method selection adhered as closely as possible to those methods specified by Ecuador in RAOHE Annex 5 and TULAS. However, he noted, in some cases, the laboratory methods stipulated in the regulations were outdated. He therefore chose alternatives which, in his professional judgement were appropriate. Details on the sample management procedures and the methods for analysis used in his work are provided in Appendices D and E of his Report.\n\n*(b) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons*\n----------------------------------\n\n543.\n\nMr. MacDonald also gave consideration to the TPH methods selected for use at this site since the methods specified in RAOHE Annex 5 have largely been withdrawn and are no longer in professional use.642 Two potentially suitable methods were used by the Parties in their investigations: IEMS used the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) Method 1005, while GSI used SW846 8015C for soil and groundwater samples and TNRCC Method 1006 for soil samples. In consultation with the laboratory, Mr. MacDonald chose to use SW846 8015C for analysis of GRO (C6-C10), DRO (C10-C28), and ORO (C20-C35), so that the possible sources of the petroleum could be better evaluated.643 To compare the results appropriately to the standards, he elected to add these fractions together to obtain a total TPH value. This technique has the potential for increasing the reported concentration of TPH in a sample due to overlapping carbons between the fractions. However, in Mr. MacDonald's professional opinion, this was a reasonable and conservative approach.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 46 & fn. 126: The following methods and publications were referenced in RAOHE Annex 5, but were not selected for various reasons: (a) 6/1997 ECY 97-602 is not a method, but is a publication summarizing multiple TPH methods; (b) EPA 413.1 s used for measurement of oil and grease, not TPH; (c) EPA 418.1, which was applicable to TPH, was withdrawn by the USEPA in 2007 due to its use of Freon 113 as a solvent; (d) method 1664 (SGT-HIEM) is used for measurement of oil and grease, not TPH; (e) ASTM D3921-96 was withdrawn by ASTM in 2013, and not replaced due to its limited use by industry; and (f) German standard DIN 38409-H18 is inactive.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 46 & fn. 127: Carbon ranges may vary slightly; those listed in the text were obtained from a fact sheet \"Petroleum Hydrocarbon Ranges\" presented by ALS, the laboratory used for this work.\n\n*(c) Metals*\n------------\n\n544.\n\nAll soil, groundwater and mud pit leachate samples were analysed for metals using USEPA Method SW6020A. Consistent with prior analyses conducted by the Parties' experts, only the following metals were analyzed: barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, vanadium, and zinc.\n\n545.\n\nRAOHE specifies a number of specific atomic absorption methods for the analysis of metals. In Mr. MacDonald's view, IEMS used such methods for metals analyses consistent with RAOHE. As for TPH, Ecuador allows for substitution of equivalent methods for metals analysis in place of those listed in Annex 5. As such, GSI used method 6010B, an inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry method, for all metals. Ramboll's selected method 6020A, also performed via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, was similar to that selected by GSI. All of the methods used by the Parties' experts and by Ramboll would be considered acceptable and equivalent pursuant to RAOHE.\n\n546.\n\nTULAS does not identify specific methods, but rather indicates that they should be consistent with those specified within the Institute of Ecuadorian Normalization or by ASTM or the USEPA.\n\n*(d) Leachability Testing*\n--------------------------\n\n547.\n\nMr. MacDonald subjected mud pit samples to both TCLP and SPLP analyses ((EPA SW-846 1311 and 1312, respectively). The leachate generated would then be analysed for the parameters required in RAOHE Table 7: TPH, barium, cadmium, total chromium, and vanadium using the analytical methods described above; and PAHs, using USEPA Method 8270D.\n\n*(e) Geotechnical Testing*\n--------------------------\n\n548.\n\nAs part of the monitoring well installation, Mr. MacDonald's team collected soil samples from the screened interval in the water bearing zones for sieve and hydrometer analysis to define the percentage of clay in accordance with ASTM Methods and D6913 and D7928, respectively. (No geotechnical testing methods are specified in RAOHE or TULAS.)\n\n**8. Bounding of Scope and Site Screening**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Key Scope Considerations*\n------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nMr. MacDonald noted that he was mandated by the Tribunal to conduct additional soil, groundwater and mud pit sampling in the Blocks as needed to determine the presence and/or extent of contamination for which remediation is required. The scope of these activities was further bound as follows:644\n\n(i) Mr. MacDonald was directed only to consider areas at the sites that were previously investigated by the Parties. His investigation was not to include sampling either at new RECs that he may have independently identified, or at RECs previously identified by the Parties that had not been sampled.\n\n(ii) Only one sampling programme was authorised by the Tribunal. As such, a multiphased sampling approach as might be more typical to delineate contamination was not implemented. Therefore, Mr. MacDonald decided that by use of a \"macro\" sampling approach, the data that could be obtained from one field campaign would still serve to narrow the extent of potential contamination at the sites.\n\n(iii) Mr. MacDonald also sought to identify usable data generated by prior work conducted by the Parties to avoid unnecessary duplication.\n\n(iv) He also determined it was not necessary to delineate every point where contamination was observed above a standard in soils. In some cases, the available data and other factors (*e.g*., topography) were sufficient in his view to reasonably estimate remedial quantities even if not fully delineated in all directions. In other instances, the available data suggested that the \"exceedance\" was likely not related to oil field contamination but rather to probable background conditions.\n\n(v) Mr. MacDonald also determined that it was appropriate to analyse for the full metal suite in every sample where any metal was previously detected above applicable criteria, rather than to restrict the analysis to specific metal exceedances in each area investigated. He did not test samples for TPH if no TPH was suspected, based on prior data, nor did he test for metals if prior data suggested only the presence of hydrocarbons.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 49.\n\n*(b) Site Screening*\n--------------------\n\n550.\n\nRamboll reviewed all data collected by the Parties for the purpose of developing a sampling programme in Blocks 7 and 21. Mr. MacDonald stated that the key consideration in this exercise was to determine appropriate screening criteria with respect to: (i) sites selected for additional sampling; (ii) data screens for various media or features, including soils, groundwater, and mud pits; and (iii) the basis and background for the additional site investigation approach.645 Along with Ramboll's exercise of professional experience and judgement, this was considered appropriate to address what he called \"*significant gaps in the overall technical analyses*\" performed by the Parties' experts.\n\n*Id.*\n\n551.\n\nA total of 69 sites were subjected to a \"*desktop screening*\" evaluation.646 Screening included consideration of:\n\n(a) The numerical criteria defined in RAOHE or, in its absence, TULAS, for unrestricted, agricultural, and industrial land uses;\n\n(b) Reassessment of land use designations by the Parties;\n\n(c) Location and quantity of temporary monitoring wells previously installed by the Parties;\n\n(d) The historical use of mud pits by Perenco; and\n\n(e) The nature of claims made on behalf of Ecuador.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, fn. 129: Mr. MacDonald used the total of 70 sites presented in IEMS' cost estimate; however, Coca 2 and Coca CPF were considered as one site.\n\n552.\n\nInitial screening resulted in a proposed suite of work that flagged 38 sites for supplemental investigation, including 30 sites where soils were to be investigated, 14 sites where groundwater was to be investigated, and 9 sites where mud pits were to be investigated. Mr. MacDonald then eliminated the following from his initial workplan:647\n\n(a) 21 sites were eliminated from consideration because no damages claims were made in respect of them;648\n\n(b) Eight additional sites were excluded because there were: (i) no groundwater claims;\n\n(ii) no evidence of mud pit use by Perenco; and (iii) no soil samples contained contamination above applicable soil cleanup criteria (excluding conductivity); and\n\n(c) Eight additional sites were excluded because: (i) contaminant delineation was near-complete; or (ii) only marginal exceedances of a single contaminant was detected.\n\n*Ibid.*, pp. 49-50.\n\n*Ibid.*, fn. 130: \"While numerous sites were included in IEMS' initial financial claim (above the \"base value\"), some sites were ultimately excluded from their claim based on application of the regulatory criteria. All such sites were initially screened out from further investigations by Ramboll. During implementation of the investigation, Ecuador identified to Ramboll that some soil samples collected from sites where no regulatory claim was made may have exceeded regulatory criteria (see Appendix B). As a result, Ramboll re-examined these sites and where appropriate, expanded our program to include sites or areas of sites that had originally been omitted from the sampling program (e.g. Oso A).\"\n\n553.\n\nAs a result of further consultation with the Parties, the initial screening evaluation was expanded to incorporate additional facts and findings. The final results of the screening evaluation are presented in the subsections below.\n\n*(i) Sites Excluded from Further Consideration*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nCertain sites identified by GSI and IEMS did not require any supplemental investigation based on the results of the Parties' previous work. The following sites did not require further testing for any media:649\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Table 4.1 - Sites Omitt** | **ed from Ram** | **boll's Investigation** |\n| Block | Site | IEMS Claim ($ millions)1 | Rationale2 |\n| CPUF | Coca 7 | 0 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| CPUF | Coca 11 | 1.8 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| CPUF | Coca 12 | 1.0 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| CPUF | Coca 13 | 8.2 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| CPUF | Coca 15 | 11.0 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| 7 | Gacela 3 | 0 | IEMS claim limited to oil well closure ($0.5 million); no soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or previous groundwater sampling |\n| 7 | Gacela 6,9 | 0 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| **Table 4.1 \u2013 Sites Omitted from Ramboll's Investigation** |\n| Block | Site | IEMS Claim ($ millions)1 | Rationale2 |\n| 7 | Lobo 2 | 0 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| 7 | Mono 10/12 | 1.0 | Soil exceedances limited to trace barium concentration adjacent to a mud pit not associated with Perenco; no previous groundwater sampling |\n| 7 | Oso 2 | 0 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| CPUF | Payamino 5 | 4.9 | Soil exceedances limited to trace vanadium concentration (background condition); no Perenco mud pits or prior groundwater sampling |\n| CPUF | Payamino 6 | 0 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| CPUF | Payamino 9 | 0 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| CPUF | Payamino 18 | 0 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| CPUF | Payamino 19 | 0 | No soil exceedances, Perenco mud pits, or prior groundwater sampling |\n| 21 | Waponi \u2013 Dayuno | 12.9 | Site was abandoned prior to Perenco's operations in the Blocks.

This information is presented to provide the Tribunal with a sense of scale as to the potential importance of the site to the overall matter; these claims did not drive Mr. MacDonald's determination of whether to include or exclude a site from further consideration. The claims exclude costs for oil well closure. 2 \"No soil exceedances\" means that upon reassessment of land use at the sites, no soil samples were found above the applicable numerical remediation criteria. |\n\n*Ibid.*, Table 4.1.\n\n555.\n\nThe initial desktop-based screening process reduced the total number of sites from 69 to 49 (an ~30% reduction in sites requiring review). The next step was to identify the environmental media to be sampled at each of the 49 sites. The tables below provide Mr. MacDonald's rationale for the exclusion of soil, groundwater, and/or mud pit investigations at specific sites based on his review of the available data.\n\n*(ii) Soils Excluded from Further Consideration*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n556.\n\nThe table below summarises those sites where Mr. MacDonald considered that further evaluation was appropriate for mud pits and/or groundwater, but no additional testing of soils was merited. Rationales for the exclusion of the soil medium are provided for each site.650\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table 4.2 \u2013 Sites Where Soils Not Further Investigated** |\n| Block | Site | IEMS Soil Claim | Adjusted Soil Claim ($ millions) | Rationale3 |\n| $ millions1 | % Associated with Mud Pit2 |\n| 7 | Jaguar 9 | 38.3 | 0% | 38.3 | No exceedances of soil regulatory criteria when correct land use applied (e.g. industrial criteria on platform and excluding samples collected from inside mud pits). |\n| 7 | Lobo 3,5,6,7 | 3.6 | 100% | 0 | No exceedances of soil regulatory criteria.

IEMS claim was restricted to area of mud pit. |\n| **Notes**1 IEMS claim obtained from regulatory-based soil remediation cost reported in IEMS 2013, Attachment 35. 2 Percentage of mud pit as presented by IEMS in a 22 November 2017 email from Gabriela Gonz\u00e1lez Gir\u00e1ldez to Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor.3 Previous soil samples met all numerical regulatory criteria when the industrial criteria were applied on the platform and the sensitive ecosystem or agricultural criteria were applied off the platform, as appropriate. |\n\n*Ibid.*, Table 4.2.\n\n557.\n\nIn Mr. MacDonald's judgement, the sites listed above did not require further soils sampling because the available documentation showed no evidence of soils exceeding the most stringent applicable Ecuadorian regulatory criteria.651 Most of the claims associated with the sites listed above were limited to mud pits, with \"exceedances\" reported by IEMS limited to soil samples collected from within mud pit boundaries.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 53.\n\n*(iii)Mud Pits Excluded from Further Consideration*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n558.\n\nPlatforms containing mud pits to be assessed for physical integrity, conformance to the RAOHE performance criteria, and cover material integrity and quality were selected based on: (i) whether mud pits were present at a given site; and (ii) whether or not there was evidence of prior use by Perenco, as based on the timing of mud pit closure (where known) and oil production well installation (where pit closure dates were not available); and (iii) other information provided by the Parties, including discussions with the Parties' representatives in the field. Mr. MacDonald's assessment of those mud pits that were associated with Perenco was provided to the Parties for confirmation.\n\n559.\n\nMr. MacDonald also reviewed documentation presented by IEMS regarding the reworking of wells, which IEMS had alleged may have resulted in residuals that required disposal. There was no record of on-site disposal of these residuals for any of the reworking activities as described in the attached reports; therefore, Mr. MacDonald did not suspect any mud pits of being \"re-opened\" for such activities. He also reviewed available leachability testing data presented by GSI to determine if prior sampling and data evaluation, having regard to RAOHE Tables 7a/7b, had been adequately conducted. While he considered that the previous testing had some utility, in all cases, additional testing was needed to assess the conditions of the pits.\n\n560.\n\nThe sites where mud pit testing was not proposed are listed below:652\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Table 4.3** | **- Sites Where Mud Pits Not Further Investigated** |\n| Block | Site | IEMS Mud Pit Claim $ millions1 | Oil Well Installation | Mud Pit Closure Date | Rationale |\n| CPUF | Coca 1 | 0 | 1/1971 | n/a | No mud pits at site |\n| CPUF | Coca 2, CPF | 1.3 | 12/1988 | 3/2001 | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Coca 4 | 0 | 1/1990 | 6/1997 | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Coca 6 | 0 | 10/1989 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Coca 8 | 2.3 | 8/1991 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Coca 9 | 0 | 1/1993 | n/a | No mud pits at site |\n| CPUF | Coca 10, 16 | 0 | 9/1993 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Gacela CPF, 1 and 8 | 0.7 | 2/1991 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Gacela 2 | 0 | 6/1992 | 2/1998 | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Gacela 4 | 1.3 | 3/1994 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Gacela 5 | 2 | 9/1994 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Jaguar 1 | 0 | 1/1988 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Jaguar 2 | 8.9 | 12/1988 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Jaguar 3 | 0 | 1/1994 | 1/1994 | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Jaguar CPF, 5 Camp | 0 | 1/1996 | 7/1996 | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Jaguar 7,8 | 0 | 2/1996 6/1996 | 10/1996 | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Lobo 1 | 0 | 2/1989 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Mono CPF, 1-5, IW | 0 | Various 1989-1997 | 9/1996 | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Mono Sur, 6-9, 11 | 0 | Various 1996-1997 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| 7 | Oso 1, CPF | 0 | 9/1970 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Payamino CPF, 1 | 0 | 11/1986 (1) 1992 (CPF) | 3/2001 | Perenco use not identified Pits at the site were used for produced water from CPF, not drilling mud. |\n| CPUF | Payamino 2 & 8 | 0 | 5/1987 9/1992 | Unknown 8/1993 | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Payamino 3 | 2.2 | 8/1987 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Payamino 4 |  | 7/1988 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Payamino 14, 20, 24 | 10.9 | 5/1994 6/1994 5/2001 | 9/1994 Unknown 12/2001 | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Payamino 10 | 1.7 | 3/1993 | 6/1993 | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Payamino 13 | 0 | 10/1993 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Payamino 15 | 2.0 | 12/1993 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Payamino 21 | 0 | 10/1994 | n/a | No mud pits at site (mud disposed at Payamino 16 IW) |\n| CPUF | Payamino 23 | 0.8 | 5/1997 | 8/2000 | Perenco use not identified |\n| CPUF | Punino 1 | 1.2 | 12/1990 | unknown | Perenco use not identified |\n| 21 | Waponi - Nemoca 1 | 0 | 12/1999 | 2/2000 | Perenco use not identified |\n| 21 | Yuralpa Pad D | 0 | 8/2006 | n/a | Two existing pits are lined and unused.

His reasons for this were as follows:\n\n(i) The Waponi-Ocatoe site was excluded from further investigation because prior testing by IEMS had identified only the presence of zinc above the applicable TULAS standard (zinc at 1.38 mg/L). Zinc is not an oil field contaminant, and no other media at this site indicated the potential presence of oil field contaminants.\n\n(ii) The Waponi-Dayuno site was entirely excluded because, although groundwater was sampled previously by IEMS, Perenco never operated on this platform.\n\n(iii) The Yuralpa Landfill site was tested by IEMS only. GSI had attempted to install a test well at this facility, but experienced refusal prior to encountering groundwater. Mr. MacDonald excluded this site because it was the only groundwater location in Block 21, based on GSI's experience there was a low probability of success, and the work would have necessitated the mobilisation of different drilling equipment, which was not readily available, to the Block.654\n\n*Ibid.*, fn. 131: Mr. MacDonald notes that in correspondence dated 14 November 2017, Perenco raised some concerns regarding the groundwater approach, including issues related to both the locations of monitoring wells and the use of filtration. These matters were addressed in his correspondence dated 28 December 2017 (found at Appendix B to his report).\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 56.\n\n562.\n\nAll other sites where groundwater was sampled by the Parties remained in the supplemental programme.\n\n*(c) Outcome of Screening Evaluation*\n-------------------------------------\n\n563.\n\nThe desktop screening process resulted in a reduction of the number of sites warranting investigation of soils, mud pits, and/or groundwater from 69 to 49 sites. The sites and media that were omitted from further review were associated with IEMS' remediation cost estimates totaling $119.5 million, or 13.6% of the total regulatory-based claim of $876 million.\n\n564.\n\nTable 4.4 of Mr. MacDonald's report lists the sites and environmental media that were further investigated, as well as the approximate amount of the IEMS regulatory-based claims associated with those facilities.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table 4.4 \u2013 Sites and Media Included in Ramboll's Supplemental Investigation2** |\n| Platform | Media in Supplemental Investigation | IEMS

Sampling Results**\n-----------------------\n\n565.\n\nMr. MacDonald's site-specific sampling plans were prepared for each site and medium that was retained for consideration after completing the screening. The guiding principles for these plans are described in summary under Section 5.1 of his Report and in greater detail in Appendices D and E.\n\n566.\n\nBetween 19 September to 15 December 2017, teams were mobilised to Blocks 7 and 21 to implement the site-specific sampling plans under Mr. MacDonald's direction. The summary of his findings is set out below.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table 5.1: Summary of Mud Pit Investigation Findings** |\n| **Site** | **Mud Pit #** | **Exceedances of Leachability Criteria for Lined Pits** | **Exceedances of Applicable Soil Criteria for Cover Material (Totals Analysis)** |\n| **B a** | **TP H** | **PA H** | **pH** | **Co nd** | **B a** | **C d** | **Ni** | **TP H** | **Criteria** |\n| Chonta (1) | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | X |  | Ind |\n| 5 | X |  | Y | X |  | X |  | X |  | Eco |\n| Coca 18, 19 (2) | 2 | X | X | Y |  |  |  |  |  |  | Ind |\n| 3 | X |  | Y |  |  |  |  |  |  | Ind |\n| 4 | X |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |  | Ind |\n| 5 | X |  | X |  |  |  |  |  |  | Ind |\n| 6 |  |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |  | Eco |\n| C\u00f3ndor Norte | 1 |  |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |  | Eco |\n| 2 | X |  |  |  |  | X |  |  |  | Eco |\n| 3 |  |  |  |  |  | X |  |  |  | Eco |\n| Jaguar 9 | 1 |  |  |  | X |  | X | X | X |  | Eco |\n| Lobo 3 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Ind |\n| 2 |  |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |  | Ind |\n| Oso 3 | 1 | X |  |  |  |  | X |  |  |  | Ind |\n| Oso 9 (3) | 1 | X |  | X |  |  |  |  |  |  | Ag |\n| 3 | X | X | Y |  |  |  |  |  |  | Ag |\n| 5 | X | X | Y | X |  |  |  |  |  | Ag |\n| 6 |  |  | X | X |  |  |  |  |  | Ag |\n| 7 |  |  | Y | X | X | X |  |  |  | Ag |\n| 8 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Ag |\n| 9 |  |  | X |  | X |  |  |  |  | Ag |\n| Oso 9A | Area 1 |  |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |  | Eco |\n| Area 2 |  |  |  | X |  | X |  |  |  | Eco |\n| Area 3 |  |  |  | X |  | X |  |  |  | Eco |\n| Area 4 | X |  |  |  |  | X |  |  |  | Eco |\n| Oso 9B | Area 1 | X |  |  | X |  | X |  |  |  | Eco |\n| Area 2 |  | X |  | X |  |  |  |  | X | Eco |\n| Area 3 |  |  |  | X |  | X |  |  |  | Eco |\n| Payamino LF | 1 | X |  |  | X |  | X |  |  |  | Ind |\n| Yuralpa A | 1 | X | Y | Y | X | X | X |  |  |  | Eco |\n| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Ind |\n| 3 |  |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |  | Ind |\n| Yuralpa E | 1 |  |  |  | X |  | X |  |  |  | Ind |\n| Yuralpa G | 1 |  |  |  |  |  | X |  |  |  | Ind |\n| 2 | X |  | Y | X |  | X |  |  |  | Ind |\n| 3 |  |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |  | Ind |\n| Yuralpa LF | 1 | X |  |  | X |  | X |  |  |  | Eco |\n| 2 | X |  | X |  |  | X |  | X |  | Eco |\n| 3 | X |  | Z | X |  | X |  |  |  | Eco |\n| **Subtotals for TCLP Parameters** (Exceedance of One Parameter within One Mud Pit) |\n| % (of 39 Mud Pits) | 18 | 5 | 13 | 23 | 3 | 19 | 1 | 4 | 1 |  |\n| 46% | 13% | 33% | 59% | 8% | 49% | 3% | 10% | 3% |  |\n| % (of 12 Sites) | 9 | 3 | 6 | 11 | 2 | 10 | 1 | 3 | 1 |  |\n| 75% | 25% | 50% | 92% | 17% | 83% | 8% | 25% | 8% |  |\n| **Subtotals for Sites** (Exceedance of at least One TCLP Parameter within at least One Mud Pit) |\n| % (of 39 Mud Pits) | 33 | 21 |\n| 85% | 54% |\n| % (of 12 Sites) | 12 | 10 |\n| 100% | 83% |\n| Notes: 1 X = exceeds using TCLP Extraction only; Y = exceeds using TCLP and SPLP; Z = exceeds using SPLP Extraction only 2 All of the above data was generated from testing conducted by Ramboll, except the following: \u2022 At Lobo 3, Mud Pit 1, GSI also conducted testing. Their results were consistent with Ramboll's \u2022 At Oso 9, Mud Pits 1, 3, and 6 were tested by GSI only \u2022 At Yuralpa Pad A, Mud Pit 1, GSI also conducted testing. They identified only pH and conductivity in the mud pit material in excess of the leachability criteria, and barium in excess of the soil remediation criteria as applied to cover material. 3 The above table presents only the results of TCLP testing. Results of the SPLP testing are separately addressed in Section 6. 4 Mud Pits 2, 3, and 4 at Chonta are not associated with Perenco operations. 5 Mud Pit 1 at Coca 18/19 is not associated with Perenco operations.6 At Lobo 3, two additional samples (LOB03-MP04 and LOB03-MP05) were collected along the southeast fence line due to conflicting records on the alignment of the mud pits at the site. Ramboll's field observation and sampling results suggest that these samples were not collected from mud pits and confirm the alignment of the mud pits. 7 Mud Pits 2 and 4 at Oso 9 are associated with Perenco but were not investigated by Ramboll or the Parties. These two mud pits are likely to contain contamination similar to that found in neighboring Mud Pit 1 and Mud Pits 3 and 5, respectively. 8 Cadmium, chromium, and vanadium were tested but not detected above the most stringent leachability criteria in any of the mud pit material samples. 9 Chromium, lead, and vanadium were not detected above the most stringent applicable soil remediation criteria in any of the soil cover samples. |\n\n*(a) Mud Pits*\n--------------\n\n567.\n\nIn general, the following can be concluded from the mud pit investigation:\n\n(a) Mr. MacDonald concluded that no information was provided that was sufficient to confirm that synthetic or clay liners are present beneath any specific mud pit. Ramboll did not drill through the bottom of the mud pits to determine the presence or absence of liner material, since this would have compromised the units if the liners were present. In some cases, Ramboll did observe torn liner material along some mud pit perimeters but had no information regarding its condition or lateral extent in the rest of the mud pit. Therefore, Mr. MacDonald decided that, without exception, the leachability testing data should be conservatively compared to the standards for unlined mud pits presented in RAOHE Table 7a.\n\n(b) The current land use in the area of each mud pit was identified as part of Ramboll's site assessment activities. The cover material analytical data were compared to the industrial, agricultural, or sensitive ecosystem/residential criteria in TULAS Table 3, Annex 2, and RAOHE Table 6, as applicable.\n\n(c) At least one mud pit did not meet the performance criteria at the 12 sites investigated. Thirty-three of the 38 mud pits investigated by the Independent Expert did not meet the performance criteria for unlined mud pits specified in RAOHE (87%) and 14 of the 38 mud pits did not meet the performance criteria for lined pits specified in RAOHE (37%). Contaminants that did not comply with the performance criteria included pH, barium, total PAHs, TPH and conductivity. These mud pits, as well as two additional mud pits located at Oso 9 that were not investigated but are inferred to contain contamination similar to that found in neighbouring mud pits that failed one or more criteria, are considered to require remediation.\n\n(d) The materials overlying 21 of the 38 investigated mud pits did not meet the soil remediation criteria applicable to soils based on determination of the applicable land use in the area. Contaminants that exceeded the criteria included barium, nickel, cadmium and TPH. In almost all cases (19 of 21 total mud pits), barium was the contaminant of concern that did not meet the criteria. This, in Mr. MacDonald's opinion, suggests a high probability that the mud pit cover material is inadequate or nonexistent and that the mud pit materials are at or near the ground surface.\n\n(e) When reviewed in totality, 100% of the sites that were investigated had at least one mud pit that did not comply with the leachability standards published in RAOHE (12/12 sites). In addition, 83% of the sites had at least one mud pit with inadequate cover material (10/12).\n\n568.\n\nMr. MacDonald identified the following site-specific findings as of particular interest:\n\n(a) In C\u00f3ndor Norte, a slope failure was observed immediately adjacent to the mapped limits of the mud pits. Based on field observations, it appears that the slope failure envelope may extend into the mud pit.\n\n(b) In Coca 18/19, the data suggest that the extent of Mud Pit 6 is greater than the area previously mapped by the Parties.\n\n(c) In Lobo 3, the locations of the mud pits were not initially clear. Ramboll inspected the area and collected vertical composite samples along both the southwest and southeast edges of the pad to confirm the mud pit locations. It was determined that the mud pits are located along the southwest edge of the pad.\n\n(d) Oso 9A slopes from the northeast to the southwest and is bound by steep slopes to the north and east. In the northeastern portion of the site, there is evidence of slope failure. Torn black plastic, possibly related to a liner system, was observed in the southwest portion of the site.\n\n*(b) Groundwater*\n-----------------\n\n569.\n\nBetween 13 November and 14 December 2017, Ramboll collected samples from 34 permanent monitoring wells installed at 12 sites. The samples were analysed for TPH and metals as described above. The findings are presented in Table 5.2 of Mr. MacDonald's Report.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table 5.2: Summary of Groundwater Investigation Findings** |\n| **Site** | **Well Location (Proximate to REC#)** | **Well ID** | **Lithology** | **Turbidity** | **Exceedances of****Applicable GW****Criteria** |\n| **% Clay** | **NTU** | **Ba** | **TPH** |\n| Coca 2, CPF | Adjacent to mud pit (02-335) | COC02-MW01 | 15.1 | 2.7 | X | X |\n| Adjacent to formation water pit (CPF-352) | COC02-MW02 | 14.3 | 0.0 |  | X |\n| OW/API Separator discharge; swamp (CPF-354/357) | COC02-MW03 | 18.9 | 0.0 |  | X |\n| COC02-MW04 | 3.2 | 0.0 |  | X |\n| COC02-MW05 | 7.8 | 0.0 |  | X |\n| Gacela 1, CPF | West of platform (no REC) | GAC01-MW01 | 26.2 | 1.5 | X | X |\n| Spill to creek SW of platform (02- 371/1Y8-195/201) | GAC01-MW02 | 18.2 | 3.6 | X | X |\n| Gacela 2 | West of platform and mud pit (no REC) | GAC02-MW01 | 32.6 | 13.5 |  | X |\n| SW of platform and mud pit (02-369/02-422) | GAC02-MW02 | 65.8 | 13.3 |  | X |\n| Jaguar 1 | NW of platform (no REC) | JAG01-MW013 | 8.9 | 1.2 |  |  |\n| West of platform (1-311) | JAG01-MW02 | 13.9 | 0.3 |  | X |\n| Jaguar 2 | Adjacent to mud pit (2-314/315) | JAG02-MW01 | - | 13.8 |  | X |\n| West of mud pit (2-314/315) | JAG02-MW024 | 57.3 | 1.2 |  |  |\n| NW of platform (2-298) | JAG02-MW03 | 30.8 | 7.8 |  | X |\n| Mono 1, CPF | North of platform (112) | MON01-MW01 | 34.1 | 0.0 | X | X |\n| NE of platform (111) | MON01-MW02 | 14.9 | 0.0 |  |  |\n| East of platform in mud discharge area (105/CPF-400) | MON01-MW03 | 38.8 | 0.0 | X | X |\n| South of platform (CPF-486) | MON01-MW04 | 18.2 | 4.2 | X | X |\n| Oso 9 | West of mud pits (9-331/340) | OSO09-MW01 | 4.9 | 7.6 |  |  |\n| Adjacent to mud pits 1-9 (9-331/340) | OSO09-MW02 | 13.9 | 0.9 |  | X |\n| Payamino 1, CPF | West of fire water pond | PAY01-MW01 | 13.0 | 12.6 |  | X |\n| Catchment area | PAY01-MW02 | 28.0 | 7.1 |  | X |\n| NW of CPF (CPF-166) | PAY01-MW03 | 16.4 | 5.4 |  |  |\n| Payamino 2 / 8 | Swamp NE of mud pit (143 / 2Y8- 351/435) | PAY02-MW01 | 22.7 | 13.2 | X | X |\n| Swamp NE of mud pit (143 / 2Y8- 351/435) | PAY02-MW02 | 49.3 | 0.0 | X |  |\n| Swamp east of platform (143 / 2Y8- 351/435) | PAY02-MW04 | 50.3 | 0.0 |  | X |\n| Payamino 4 / Payamino 14/20/24 | River access road, NE (04-114) | PAY04-MW01 | - | 3.1 | X | X |\n| River access road at site corner (04-114) | PAY04-MW02 | 6.6 | 0.0 | X | X |\n| Oil-contaminated area NW of Pay-14/20/24 and SW of mud pit | PAY04-MW03 | 16.5 | 0.0 | X | X |\n| **Table 5.2: Summary of Groundwater Investigation Findings** |\n| **Site** | **Well Location (Proximate to REC#)** | **Well ID** | **Lithology** | **Turbidity** | **Exceedances of****Applicable GW****Criteria** |\n| **% Clay** | **NTU** | **Ba** | **TPH** |\n| Adjacent to mud pit (no REC) | PAY14-MW01 | 7.6 | 13.7 |  |  |\n| Payamino 13 | SW of platform (No REC) | PAY13-MW01 | 15.5 | 0.0 |  | X |\n| South of platform (No REC) | PAY13-MW02 | 23.0 | 12.1 | X | X |\n| Payamino 15 | East of platform (No REC) | PAY15-MW01 | 30.4 | 9.8 | X | X |\n| Adjacent to mud pit (111) | PAY15-MW02 | 32.8 | 0.0 |  |  |\n| **Total Wells with a TPH and/or Barium Exceedance** |\n| % (of 34 wells \u2013 includes all) | 13 | 25 |\n| 38% | 74% |\n| **Totals Sites with at least One Well with a TPH and/or Barium Exceedance** |\n| % (of 12 sites \u2013 includes all) | 7 | 12 |\n| 58% | 100% |\n| Notes: 1 To assist in well location orientation, Ramboll has provided REC# as identified by one or both Parties. 2 At the time of sample collection, sheens and petroleum odors were observed in the samples collected from the following monitoring wells: COC02-MW01, COC02-MW02, COC02-MW03, and COC02-MW04, GAC01-MW02, JAG02-MW01, MON01-MW01, MW02, MW03, MW04, OSO09-MW02, PAY01-MW01, PAY02-MW01, PAY02-MW02, PAY02-MW04, PAY04-MW03, PAY13-MW01, PAY13-MW02 and PAY15-MW02.3 The TPH concentration in sample JAG01-MW01 was at the applicable criteria (325 ug/L).4 Sample JAG02-MW02 was analyzed for TPH using method TX1005 instead of method US EPA Method 8015. The detection method for this sample (450 ug/L) exceeded the applicable criteria of 325 ug/L. |\n\n570.\n\nIn general, the following can be concluded:\n\n(a) Mr. MacDonald considered that Ramboll's well construction and sampling techniques allowed it to produce non-turbid, unfiltered groundwater samples that accurately represent the chemical quality of groundwater at the sites. In all cases, sampled groundwater was observed to be clear and free of sediments and/or clouding and had a low turbidity (*i.e*., less than 14 NTU, and in most cases below 10 NTU).\n\n(b) Ramboll collected soil samples from the water bearing zones at each well to assess the clay content in the screened interval. This sampling was done, in part, to determine if there was some correlation between clay content and turbidity levels, and to address a reference in TULAS with respect to groundwater criteria. While the clay content varied between locations within and across sites, groundwater was produced in all wells and there seems to be little correlation between the clay content and the turbidity levels as determined from well sampling activities. The relevance of these findings is discussed further in Section 6.1 of Mr. MacDonald's Report.\n\n(c) Based on Ramboll's sampling results, TPH contamination in groundwater above the TULAS standard is present in all 12 investigated sites, and in 74% of sampled monitoring wells. The maximum observed concentration of TPH was 1915 \u00b5g/L at Payamino 2/8, as compared to the TULAS criterion of 325 \u00b5g/L. Barium is found at 58% of the sites, and in 38% of the sampled wells. The maximum observed concentration of barium was 4700 \u00b5g/L at Gacela 1, as compared to the criterion of 338 \u00b5g/L. No other contaminants of concern were identified in the monitoring wells.\n\n*(c) Soils*\n-----------\n\n571.\n\nBetween 19 September and 15 December 2017, Ramboll collected and analysed 801 soil samples from 40 sites. These samples were collected from locations intended to delineate areas of known soil contamination exceeding Ecuador's numerical criteria in TULAS (Table 3 of Annex 2) or RAOHE (Table 6) and to address significant data gaps. In general, Mr. MacDonald found that the aggregate exceedances of concentration criteria for soils do not directly correspond to the severity of contamination at a site or the need for site remediation. However, Mr. MacDonald made two key observations which apply to the totality of the soil data:\n\n(a) The data collected by Ramboll fills data gaps and supplements data previously gathered by the Parties that indicated oilfield related contamination, primarily barium and TPH. It can, in his opinion, be relied upon to estimate remedial footprints.655\n\n(b) Elevated cadmium and vanadium concentrations are found throughout the Blocks. As determined through background evaluations conducted by both the Parties and Ramboll, these concentrations largely appear to Mr. MacDonald to be associated with natural background conditions.656 Particularly for vanadium, the distribution of this metal appears to be both widespread and random, with a wide range of naturally occurring concentrations. There are a few cases where cadmium and vanadium were found at concentrations above the calculated background concentrations.

After additional sampling around one main area: The area east of the platform (REC 234; oil-water separator discharge) was further investigated by samples at borings PAY23-01 through PAY23-07. Petroleum odor and / or staining were noted in subsurface soils at PAY23-01 and PAY23-02. However, TPH did not exceed the sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion in any of the samples. Barium (up to 7,500 mg/kg) exceeded the applicable criterion to the south, east and north of the area investigated. Vanadium (up to 155 mg/kg) also exceeded the applicable criterion in all directions around this area. At one isolated location, lead (up to 89.6 mg/kg) was detected above the applicable criterion.690\n\n*Id.*\n\n606.\n\n**Payamino WTS / LF** : Within the areas investigated by Ramboll, the prior barium and TPH exceedances were not fully delineated vertically or horizontally. After additional sampling around three main areas: TPH and barium in soils in areas north, east and south of the mud pit (REC 305) were delineated by samples at borings PAYWTS-01 through PAYWTS-06 as neither TPH nor barium exceeded the industrial use criteria in any of the samples.

After additional sampling around three main areas: TPH in the area west of the platform (not associated with an identified REC; located near oil-water separator discharge) was delineated by samples at PUN01-01 through PUN01-04 as TPH did not exceed the sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion in any of the samples.692\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 96.\n\n*(ii) Block 21*\n---------------\n\n608.\n\nFor Block 21, Ramboll's findings were as follows.693\n\n*Ibid.*, Section 5.3.3.2.\n\n609.\n\n**Chonta** : Within the areas investigated by Ramboll, the prior TPH exceedances to the south of the site were not fully delineated vertically or horizontally. After additional sampling around one main area: The soil pile and raised area in the vicinity of Mud Pit 5 (REC 281; allegedly an unclosed mud pit) were further investigated by samples at borings CHON-01 through CHON-03. Petroleum odor and staining were noted in subsurface soils at CHON-02 and CHON-03, so TPH analysis was also performed on samples collected at this site. However, TPH did not exceed the sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion in any of the samples. Barium (5,250 mg/kg) exceeded the applicable criterion at CHON-02. Cadmium (1.54 mg/kg) at CHON-01 and nickel (63.9 mg/kg) at CHON-03 also exceeded the applicable criteria.

TPH was not detected above the industrial use criterion in any of the samples.698\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 98.\n\n**10. Remedial requirements**\n-----------------------------\n\n*(a) Conceptual Remedial Plans*\n-------------------------------\n\n614.\n\nMr. MacDonald identified and evaluated potential soil, mud pit and shallow groundwater remedial alternatives with reference to four primary criteria: demonstrability, technical feasibility, regulatory acceptance, and permanence. Considering site-specific characterisation of affected media as well as other environmental conditions, a remedial technology was excluded from further consideration if it:699\n\n(a) Was not generally accepted under TULAS or RAOHE;\n\n(b) Was not well-established;\n\n(c) Necessitated installation of a new significant, reliable and continuous power source;\n\n(d) Was ineffective;\n\n(e) Required highly specialised equipment that was not locally available; or\n\n(f) Would not meet the remedial objectives.\n\n*Ibid.*, Section 6.3.1.\n\n615.\n\nFollowing this screening process, Mr. MacDonald ranked the retained alternatives by considering their short-term effectiveness (*i.e.*, risks to human health and the environment during remedy implementation), long-term effectiveness (*i.e.*, risks to human health and the environment following remedy implementation), implementability (*i.e*., ease, reliability, and flexibility of implementation considering site constraints) and relative costs. For each criterion, the technologies were scored relative to each other and the cumulative scores were totaled, weighted, and compared to define preferred options (*i.e*., the alternatives with the highest scores). Mr. MacDonald's preferred remedial options for each target medium are set out in Table 6.2 to his Report, which is reproduced below:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table 6.2: Selected Remedial Alternatives** |\n| Nonconforming Media | Retained Remedial Alternatives |\n| Soil (TPH exceedances only) | Ex-situ Treatment (landfarming)d Excavation, Treatment and On-Site Containmentd,e Excavation, Treatment and Off-Site Disposal |\n| Soil (metal exceedances with or without TPH exceedances) | Excavation, Treatment and On-Site Containmente Excavation, Treatment and Off-Site Disposal |\n| Mud Pits | In-situ Treatmentf and Capping Mud Pit Rehabilitation/Lining, On-site Disposal and Capping (per RAOHE Article 59)g Mud Pit Rehabilitation/Lining, Material Treatmenth, On-site Disposal and Capping (per RAOHE Article 59) Excavation and Treatment and Off-Site Disposal |\n| Ground water | Pump and treat systemh Permeable reactive barrieri |\n| Notes: a Ex-situ refers to remedial action following removal at a designated on-site or central area. b In-situ refers to remedial action in place, without the need for excavation and transport to a designated on-site or central area. c On-site refers to a location within the facility or a nearby facility. Off-site refers to a third-party location outside the facility. d This alternative could include consolidation of TPH impacted soils from various sites in a central area and management as a single media. e This alternative could include consolidation of nonconforming soils with nonconforming mud pit materials and management of both as a single media. f In-situ treatment only refers to liming to adjust pH. g For mud pit materials not conforming to the unlined performance criteria but meeting the lined performance criteria. h Mud pit treatment could include mixing with reagents such as Portland cement, borrow soils, and/or lime. i This alternative is only viable at continuously manned sites where there is an existing power source and means for storage and treatment of extracted ground water. j The permeable reactive barrier is typically placed in the downgradient side of an affected ground water area. However, given the predicted relatively low potential for contaminant migration for most sites, such a PRB would not be effective in addressing groundwater contamination as the PRB relies on sufficient water flowing through the reactive media. A variation of this alternative would involve placement of reactive media (to oxidize or reduce contaminants) at the base of proposed excavations within such areas where groundwater sampling has identified contamination. |\n\n616.\n\nMr. MacDonald considered that the conceptual remedy selection for soils conforms to paragraph 4.1.3.6 and 4.1.3.7 of TULAS Annex 2, Book VI, while that for mud pits conforms to Articles 52(d)2.3 and 59(b) of RAOHE. These define generally accepted remedial approaches by the Ministry of the Environment in Ecuador and establish specific performance criteria. Further, in defining the conceptual remedial approach the following factors were considered:\n\n(a) Each site was considered in its entirety, such that the selected remedial plan would address all affected media.\n\n(b) The remedial approach considered for a specific area considered other remedial activities at the site such that the least number of remedial technologies would be implemented to simplify implementation.\n\n(c) If water was to be removed (*e.g*., dewatering of excavation, dewatering of swampy soils), it was assumed that two modular temporary water treatment systems would be used and shared between sites.\n\n(d) If remedial action was to be implemented in swampy areas requiring dewatering to allow construction in \"dry conditions\" or to manage surface water, it was assumed that a temporary and reusable dam system would be used.\n\n617.\n\nMr. MacDonald considered that these factors would allow for remedy optimisation and/or reduced implementation costs.\n\n*(b) Cost Estimates*\n--------------------\n\n618.\n\nMr. MacDonald then developed site-specific cost estimates for the selected conceptual remedial alternative to address affected media at each site using standard engineering methods which incorporated local unit costs, where available.700 Remedial cost estimates were developed in general conformance with the USEPA and USACE guidelines. These are detailed in Appendix I to his Report. Mr. MacDonald acknowledged that the accuracy of estimates at the conceptual remedy design stage would be expected to be less than that of estimates developed at subsequent design stages, nevertheless, for most sites, he considered that the available data was adequate to develop reasonable estimates of remedial costs for the site-specific remedial plans.701 Where the data was incomplete (*e.g*., partial or incomplete horizontal and/or vertical delineation), higher contingencies were used to account for scope uncertainty.\n\n*Ibid.*, Section 6.3.3.\n\nThese estimates were based on conditions known at the time of the Report's writing. With completion of pre-design investigations and the remedial design activities, adjustments to these estimates were possible.\n\n619.\n\nThe quantities used in the development of the remedial costs were mostly defined based on delineated or inferred horizontal and vertical extents of soil contamination, mapped mud pit dimensions, and projected groundwater impairment. Where contamination was identified but not completely delineated or characterised, the Expert employed \"order of magnitude\" remedial estimates. For certain remedial activities where quantities (*e.g*., excavation dewatering volume, reagent quantities required to meet remedial goals, depth of permeable reactive barriers, mud pit configuration), material properties (*e.g*., water content or density of excavated materials, swell and shrink ratios for materials) or duration of treatment process (*e.g*., landfarming) could not be fully defined, these factors were assumed based on site-specific conditions and the Expert's professional experience with similar projects.\n\n620.\n\nUnit costs and production rates used in the remedial cost estimates were defined from a combination of: (i) quotes obtained from remedial contractors in Ecuador; (ii) quotes obtained from United States suppliers of materials (*i.e*., reagents) with experience in Ecuador; (iii) verified unit rates previously obtained by the Parties; and (iv) published remedial unit costs in the United States (*e.g*., RS Means, RACER) adjusted through the use of location indices. While some local contractors did not provide definitive quotes in the absence of a detailed project scope, site details, and the possibility of a site visit, Mr. MacDonald believed that the unit pricing estimated that he used was adequate for overall cost projections. The unit pricing used in the cost estimates was inclusive of labor, equipment, materials, and overhead and profit, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n621.\n\nIn developing the remedial cost estimates, the remedial process was subdivided into major construction tasks, which where were further subdivided as appropriate:\n\n(a) **Pre-Construction Activities:** These include additional pre-design investigation activities to better define remedial quantities and assess the extent and magnitude of groundwater impacts, environmental permitting to allow implementation of the proposed remedial actions and their design. Related Costs were allocated proportionally to the soil, mud pit and groundwater remedial estimates.702\n\n(b) **Site Preparation:** These include *inter alia* equipment and material mobilization to prepare sites for remedial works. Related costs were allocated proportionally to the soil, mud pit and groundwater remedial estimates.703\n\n(c) ***Ex-Situ*** **Treatment of Soils \u2013 Landfarming:** *Ex-situ* soil treatment through landfarming is only applicable to soils affected by TPH and ultimately leads to backfilling of the treated soils and restoration of disturbed areas.704\n\n(d) **Soil Excavation, Treatment and Disposal:** This involves the excavation, treatment and disposal activities in non-mud pit areas. Excavated materials would be treated by stabilisation/solidification (*i.e*., mixing with reagents such as Portland cement, borrow soils, and/or lime) if impacted by metals (with or without TPH) or TPH alone.705\n\n(e) **Mud Pit Remediation:** There are three potential alternatives depending on the extent of conformance to the RAOHE performance criteria. Specifically, (i) mud pit materials that do not meet the performance criteria for lined mud pits would be treated and placed in reconstructed lined mud pits, (ii) mud pit materials that only fail to meet the unlined mud pit performance criteria would be placed in reconstructed lined mud pits, and (iii) mud pit materials not conforming to the unlined pH criteria in RAOHE would be treated *in-situ*. In all cases, the integrity of the closed mud pit would need to be ensured through periodic maintenance (mowing) and use of the mud pit area restricted through installation of a perimeter fence if one does not already exist.706\n\n(f) **Groundwater Remediation:** In areas where soil/mud pit and groundwater sampling have identified collocated contamination, groundwater remediation activities are integrated with soil or mud pit remediation activities. In the few cases where there is potential for a higher degree of groundwater contaminant migration, groundwater remediation would consist of installation of a permeable reactive barrier. This passive groundwater treatment system would not require operation and maintenance but would require periodic monitoring to document the effectiveness of the treatment system.707\n\n(g) **Construction Management** : These relate to the oversight and documentation of the remedial action and the reporting of the work performed. Associated costs were allocated proportionally to the soil, mud pit and groundwater remedial estimates.708\n\n(h) **Contingency:** Contingency costs were defined based on how well the scope of the proposed remedy could be defined and ranged from 10% to 30% depending on complexity and certainty. These were allocated proportionally to the soil, mud pit and groundwater remedial estimates.709\n\n(i) **Recurring Costs:** These include long-term maintenance and monitoring costs, applied after remedy implementation. Certain remedies would require periodic physical inspections and site maintenance. For groundwater remedies, annual groundwater monitoring for 10 years to document treatment effectiveness have been considered. While the cap maintenance activities will be required in perpetuity, for estimating purposes, these costs are assumed to span 30 years.710\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 135.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 135.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Ibid.*, pp. 135-136.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 136.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 136.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 137.\n\n622.\n\nIn addition, based on experience of local contractors that recently conducted remedial work on behalf of Petroamazonas in the region, a labor cost multiplier of three to five was applied to those projects to address health and safety and community relations requirements imposed by Petroamazonas, which affect remedial work productivity and effectiveness. This factor also accounts for the potential for added security necessary for implementation of the work. In the absence of detailed cost breakdowns or defined durations for all construction activities, Ramboll could not reliably determine the degree to which such a factor should be applied in its remedial cost estimations. Ramboll believed that this factor may be partially offset by the applied contingencies and the conservative assumptions used in defining remedial quantities.711 Quantity and costs are set out at Tables 6.3 to 6.10 of the Independent Expert Report.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*(c) Summary of Cost Estimates*\n-------------------------------\n\n623.\n\nBased on Mr. MacDonald's consideration of the conceptual remedial plans and possible viable remediation methods and the associated costs, Mr. MacDonald considered that the estimates of probable remedial costs for the site-specific remedial plans were reasonable.\n\n624.\n\nBased on these conceptual remedial plans, Ramboll developed site-specific cost estimates using standard cost estimating methods and in general conformance with the USEPA and USACE guidelines:712\n\n(a) Remedial quantities were mostly defined based on delineated or inferred horizontal and vertical extents of soil contamination, mapped mud pit dimensions, and degree of predicted groundwater impairment. In cases where impacts were identified but not completely delineated or characterized, order of magnitude remedial estimates were provided.\n\n(b) For certain remedial quantities or material properties, assumptions were made based on site-specific conditions and professional experience with similar projects.\n\n(c) Unit costs and production rates used in the remedial cost estimates were defined from a combination of: (a) quotes obtained from remedial contractors in Ecuador; (b) quotes obtained from United States suppliers of materials with experience in Ecuador; (c) verified unit rates previously obtained by the Parties; and (d) published remedial unit costs in the United States (*e.g*., RS Means, RACER), adjusted using location indexes.\n\n(d) For complex sites (*e.g.*, presence of underground pipelines, steep slopes, limited access, work within swamps), higher contingencies were applied to account for scope uncertainty.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 150.\n\n625.\n\nThese are set out in Table 6.11 of his Independent Expert Report:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Table 6.11: Summary of Remedial Cost Estimates** |\n| Site | Estimated Remedial Cost |\n| Soils | Mud Pits | Groundwater | Total |\n| Coca 01 | $788 | - | - | $788 |\n| Coca 02, CPF | $2,700 |  | $3,001 | $5,701 |\n| Coca 04 | $308 |  |  | $308 |\n| Coca 06 | $5,223 |  |  | $5,223 |\n| Coca 08 | $10,055 |  |  | $10,055 |\n| Coca 09 | $805 |  |  | $805 |\n| Coca 10, 16 | $781 |  |  | $781 |\n| Coca 18, 19 | $406 | $3,123 |  | $3,529 |\n| C\u00f3ndor Norte | $6,339 | $2,484 |  | $8,823 |\n| Gacela 01, CPF | $2,103 | - | $1,397 | $3,500 |\n| Gacela 02 | $1,575 | - | $597 | $2,172 |\n| Gacela 04 | $195 | - | - | $195 |\n| **Table 6.11: Summary of Remedial Cost Estimates** |\n| Site | Estimated Remedial Cost |\n| Soils | Mud Pits | Groundwater | Total |\n| Gacela 05 | $247 |  | - | $247 |\n| Jaguar 01 | $3,104 |  | $438 | $3,542 |\n| Jaguar 02 | $8,505 |  | $1,173 | $9,678 |\n| Jaguar 03 | $5,643 |  | - | $5,643 |\n| Jaguar 05, CPF | $379 |  | - | $379 |\n| Jaguar 07, 08 | $323 |  | - | $323 |\n| Jaguar 09 | - | $541 |  | $541 |\n| Lobo 01 | $1,361 | - | - | $1,361 |\n| Lobo 03 | - | $101 | - | $101 |\n| Lobo 04 | $717 | - | - | $717 |\n| Mono CPF | $15,773 | - | $5,030 | $20,803 |\n| Mono Sur | $1,281 | - | - | $1,281 |\n| Oso 01, CPF | $186 | - | - | $186 |\n| Oso 03 | - | $1,906 | - | $1,906 |\n| Oso 09 | - | $5,317 | $3,415 | $8,732 |\n| Oso 09A | - | $2,948 | - | $2,948 |\n| Oso 09B | - | $1,507 | - | $1,507 |\n| Oso A | $228 | - | - | $228 |\n| Payamino 01, CPF | $4,746 | - | $1,404 | $6,150 |\n| Payamino 02, 08 | $15,316 |  | $4,343 | $19,659 |\n| Payamino 03 | $110 - $129 |  | - | $110 - $129 |\n| Payamino 04, 14 | $3,411 |  | $1,611 | $5,022 |\n| Payamino 10 | $313 |  | - | $313 |\n| Payamino 13 | - |  | $1,166 | $1,166 |\n| Payamino 15 | - |  | $1,166 | $1,1 66 |\n| Payamino 16 | - |  |  |  |\n| Payamino 21 | $155 |  |  | $155 |\n| Payamino 23 | $1,765 |  |  | $1,765 |\n| Payamino WTS | $1,493 | $2,978 |  | $4,471 |\n| Punino | $121 | - |  | $121 |\n| Chonta | $645 | $1,404 |  | $2,049 |\n| Nemoca | $530 | - |  | $530 |\n| Yuralpa A | $202 | $1,034 |  | $1,236 |\n| Yuralpa CPF | $98 | - |  | $98 |\n| Yuralpa D | $475 | - |  | $475 |\n| Yuralpa E | - | $193 |  | $193 |\n| Yuralpa G | - | $963 |  | $963 |\n| Yuralpa LF | - | $12,217 |  | $12,217 |\n| **TOTAL** | **$98,423** | **$36,715** | **$24,742** | **$159,881** |\n| **Table 6.11: Summary of Remedial Cost Estimates** |\n| Site | Estimated Remedial Cost |\n| Soils | Mud Pits | Groundwater | Total |\n| Notes: 1.

Opinions Regarding the Technical Findings in the Blocks**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n626.\n\nMr. MacDonald's key conclusions and opinions regarding the comprehensive technical findings in the Blocks are as follows:713\n\n(a) The field work conducted by Ramboll significantly enhanced the body of knowledge and technical platform with respect to contamination across the sites in Blocks 7 and 21 and serves as a credible basis to determine unbiased and independent cost estimates.\n\n(b) The comprehensive mud pit investigation shows that a large percentage of mud pits in the Blocks do not meet the performance standards in RAOHE and require remediation.\n\n(c) Representative data obtained from all of the investigated platforms in the Blocks shows that groundwater has been impaired by oilfield operations and requires remediation.\n\n(d) The comprehensive soil investigation adequately defined the extent of oilfield-related impacts at the Blocks that require remediation. The data gathered was sufficient to reasonably define remedial quantities.\n\n(e) The analytical tools and guiding principles used to define media-specific remedial requirements are consistent with Ecuador's regulations, professional practices, and the Tribunal's direction.\n\n(f) Remedial options for affected media were systematically evaluated to pre-select locally available, demonstrated, implementable and cost-effective alternatives that conform to generally accepted remedial approaches described in TULAS or RAOHE. The remedial options were then assembled into site-specific conceptual remedial plans to address the affected media. Associated remedial cost estimates were developed using standard cost estimating methods that incorporate unit costs from local contractors, published remedial unit costs adjusted using location indexes.\n\n*Ibid.*, Section 7.\n\nE. **The Parties' Comments**\n----------------------------\n\n627.\n\nFollowing the transmission of Mr. MacDonald's Report to the Parties, the Tribunal permitted the Parties to make two forms of written submissions on the Report, to request certain documents of each other, and to make oral submissions and pose questions to the Expert at a two-day hearing held in The Hague on 11-12 March 2019.\n\n628.\n\nIn relation to the written materials, the Parties were instructed to annotate the Independent Expert Report by providing focused comments on each main part of the Report. Their comments were thus inserted into a \"**Consolidated Expert Report**.\" In addition, the Parties were invited to file general comments on the Report in a separate written submission not to exceed 30 pages.\n\n629.\n\nAfter these documents were filed on 22 February 2019, they were transmitted to Mr. MacDonald for his review. On Day 1 of the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald gave a 90-minute presentation to the Parties and the Tribunal in which he explained his key findings and responded to the Parties' written comments. The Parties were then each given two hours to cross examine him.\n\n630.\n\nThis was followed by a witness conferencing session wherein Mr. MacDonald was paired first with a representative of IEMS and then with a representative of GSI. Each Party was permitted to put questions to the two experts. On Day 2, the Parties were once again permitted to put questions to Mr. MacDonald and then to make closing submissions on the Independent Expert's work.\n\n**1. Ecuador's Observations on the Independent Expert's Findings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n631.\n\nEcuador observed that Mr. MacDonald limited himself to a single \"data gap filling\" sampling campaign, consistent with the Tribunal's mandate.714 In Ecuador's view, the Independent Expert employed best and current industry practices throughout his field campaign. His Report confirms Ecuador's position that extensive and widespread environmental harm was left behind by Perenco in Blocks 7 and 21, and that Perenco was not a diligent and prudent operator that acted in full compliance with Ecuadorian environmental regulations.715 Mr. MacDonald has closed significant data gaps and estimated higher remediation volumes and costs for said contamination than Perenco's experts and effectively vindicated Ecuador's position that contamination extends beyond the sampled points and that the use of predictive modelling software (as used by IEMS) to estimate the full extent of contamination in the Blocks was justified.716\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 4.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 1.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 9.\n\n632.\n\nFollowing Mr. MacDonald's findings and conclusions, and on the basis of newly-available data, Ecuador updated its claims for such sites where Mr. MacDonald has confirmed additional remedial volumes and costs compared to its \"regulatory case\":717\n\n(a) Soil remediation costs:\n\ni. Coca 10/16: at least US$781,000;\n\nii. Jaguar 1: at least US$3,104,000;\n\niii. Jaguar 5/CPF: at least US$379,000;\n\niv. Lobo 4: at least US$717,000;\n\nv. Oso A: at least US$228,000;\n\nvi. Payamino 23: at least US$1,765,000; and\n\nvii. Yuralpa F/CPF: at least US$98,000.\n\n(b) Groundwater remediation costs:\n\ni. Mono CPF: at least US$5,030,000;\n\nii. Oso 9: at least US$3,415,000; and\n\niii. Payamino 2/8: at least US$4,343,000.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 31.\n\n633.\n\nAt the same time, Ecuador argued that Mr. MacDonald did not capture the full extent of the contamination caused by Perenco, and has estimated only the minimum required remedial needs arising out of what it called Perenco's \"*reckless operations*.\"718 Ecuador's comments on specific aspects of Mr. MacDonald's investigation are set out below.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 4.\n\n*(a) Soil*\n----------\n\n634.\n\nEcuador considers that Mr. MacDonald's investigation of soil contamination was generally in compliance with the Tribunal's mandate.719\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 10.\n\n635.\n\nFirst, Mr. MacDonald restricted the sampling campaign to previously sampled areas. Insofar as Perenco criticises Mr. MacDonald for sampling outside of his mandate, Ecuador argues that the Tribunal's instruction that \"*[t]o the extent that the areas surrounding those points of contamination were not delineated [\u2026] that process of delineation must now occur*\"720 was complied with when Mr. MacDonald stepped away approximately 10 to 15 metres from the Parties' samples to collect additional samples in a soil pile a few metres to the east of Perenco's auxiliary (and contaminated) pits at Coca 18/19.721\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 11 & fn. 33, referring to Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 601.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 11.\n\n636.\n\nSecond, in Ecuador's opinion, Mr. MacDonald's reliance on discrete soil samples (of intervals of less than 0.3 m) for delineation purposes allowed him to capture the highest concentrations of contaminants within each sampled interval. This resulted in higher remediation volumes, in contrast to GSI's vertical 1-metre composites which underestimated contamination through dilution.\n\n637.\n\nEcuador observes that Mr. MacDonald adjusted the applicable criteria to account for background metals levels where there were likely natural concentrations of heavy metals. This resulted in the exclusion of hundreds of the Parties' samples as well as Mr. MacDonald's own delineation samples that showed the presence of vanadium and cadmium exceedances above the thresholds specified in RAOHE and TULAS.722\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 13.\n\n638.\n\nTurning to land use classifications, Ecuador defends Mr. MacDonald's methodology against Perenco's criticisms:\n\n(a) First, contrary to Perenco's criticism that Mr. MacDonald relied on visual inspections for land use designations, he did not.723 In any event, Perenco's own experts limited their land use designations assessment to visual inspection.724\n\n(b) Second, Mr. MacDonald could not be faulted by Perenco for looking at actual land use when that was Perenco's case all along.725\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 392:8-14; Ecuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 15.\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 392:15-393:4, referring to page C36 of Appendix C to GSI ER I.\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 393:5-19.\n\n639.\n\nHowever, Ecuador itself raised a number of criticisms of Mr. MacDonald's soil remediation estimates.\n\n640.\n\nFirst, even though Ecuador acknowledges that Mr. MacDonald's guidelines for land use classification were generally in line with the Tribunal's mandate to apply the more stringent land use designation, Ecuador argues that his classifications for certain locations were too permissive. Ecuador cites as examples the area to the northeast of the platform in Payamino 4 which had been reclassified as \"industrial\", and the classification of Coca 1 and Gacela 1/8 as \"agricultural\", even though the Consortium and prior operators acknowledged that areas of water interaction were \"sensitive.\"726 Ecuador also argues that Lobo 1 should be remediated to a sensitive ecosystem standard, not agricultural, as it had been abandoned by Perenco and had not been operated by Petroamazonas, and this would be in line with Mr. MacDonald's remediation approach for other platforms which have not been operated since Perenco's abandonment.\n\nEcuador's Annotations to Section 3.1 of Independent Expert Report, Section 3.1, para 6.\n\n641.\n\nSecond, Ecuador criticises Mr. MacDonald's exclusion of three sites where soil exceedances above the applicable regulatory criteria were identified: Lobo 2 samples had barium exceedances, Payamino 5 samples had barium exceedances, and Payamino 19 samples had TPH exceedances.727 Mr. MacDonald also excluded from his investigations seven other sites on the basis that Perenco had not drilled in those sites or Perenco-associated pits were not identified. However, Ecuador argues, it cannot be ruled out that Perenco's activities had taken place at these sites and they should have been investigated further.728 Ecuador also argues that Mr. MacDonald should at the very least have delineated as orders of magnitude.729\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 34 and fn. 88.\n\nEcuador's Comments to Section 4.2 of Independent Expert Report, paragraph 1, referring to Ecuador's Comments to the Mud Pit Fact Sheet dated 22 September 2017.\n\nEcuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 13.\n\n642.\n\nThird, the Independent Expert's soil delineation was incomplete. Complete delineation was only performed at 12 sites. Ecuador points to Mr. MacDonald's acknowledgement of this point in his Report as well as at Expert Hearing.730 To identify the full extent of vertical and horizontal contamination, sampling should continue until 'clean soil' was found; however, 239 out of 804 samples collected by Mr. MacDonald still were not 'clean'. Mr. MacDonald instead estimated the boundaries of contamination based on existing data and bounding conditions as well as field observations. An example of such incomplete delineation is Coca 8, where Mr. MacDonald's sampling still found contamination and where he assumed an average of 3-metre depth for remediation even though he acknowledged that exceedances were found at depths of up to 4.5 metres.731\n\nEcuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 16, referring to Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 248:14-16.\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 38.\n\n643.\n\nFinally, Ecuador criticised Mr. MacDonald's decision to estimate \"orders of magnitude\" for remediation when data was insufficient. There was no guarantee that these estimates captured all contamination present in those areas. Once again, Ecuador relied on Coca 8 as an example where there was no reason to believe that Mr. MacDonald's estimate properly captured all contamination.\n\n*(b) Mud Pits*\n--------------\n\n644.\n\nEcuador observed that, contrary to Perenco's contention that it consistently followed good practices with respect to mud pits, the Expert found that the contents of 34 of 38 sampled Perenco-associated mud pits failed to conform with RAOHE criteria. All 12 of the investigated sites had at least one mud pit that did not comply with leachability standards and 11 of those sites also had at least one mud pit with inadequate cover material.732\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 16.\n\n645.\n\nWith respect to Mr. MacDonald's decision to sample the Oso 9A and 9B off-site pits, which was criticised by Perenco as falling outside of his mandate, Ecuador argued that he was right to do so. Mr. MacDonald's decision to sample these pits was consistent with his mandate for three reasons: first, said pit area had been previously sampled in 2010 by IEMS; second, Perenco acknowledged having performed workovers at Oso 9 and drilling nearby wells and did not deny having used such pits; and third, GSI referred to sampling conducted by Perenco at the alleged time of the closure of these pits.733\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 18.\n\n646.\n\nEcuador asserted that Mr. MacDonald properly verified the conformance of all mud pit leachate samples against the criteria in RAOHE Table 7 through the TCLP leachate test specified by RAOHE. Although Mr. MacDonald also used the SPLP method to \"*qualitatively [\u2026] assess the potential for in-situ leaching of detected constituents in mud pit materials*\", he did not rely on SPLP results, as GSI \"inappropriately\" did, to assess compliance with RAOHE.734\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 19.\n\n647.\n\nEcuador also argued that Mr. MacDonald's decision to treat all pits as unlined was justified, given that they constitute exposure pathways due to their depth and shallowness of the phreatic level (*i.e.*, shallow groundwater). This was all the more relevant considering the lack of evidence of liners in pits, as Mr. MacDonald pointed out.735 Ecuador recalled that GSI had admitted that it \"*didn't conduct a separate test regarding the presence or absence of synthetic liners*.\"736 Even if Perenco had installed liners (which it has not established), there was no certainty that the liners fully extended beneath the pits and remained intact. Indeed, Perenco's own employees stated that the Consortium was careless when depositing drilling muds such that some liners cracked under the high temperatures.737\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 20 & fn. 58.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 20 & fn. 59.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 20.\n\n648.\n\nThe liner issue aside, Ecuador had a number of criticisms about Mr. MacDonald's mud pit investigations.\n\n649.\n\nFirst, Mr. MacDonald excluded from further investigation mud pits in 30 sites which he investigated on the basis that Perenco's use had not been identified.738 However, there is evidence that drilling mud and/or other wastes may have been generated by Perenco at these sites, which indicates that Perenco must have used these mud pits, or that Perenco failed to demonstrate that these pits are properly closed. These mud pits should, thus, have been further investigated. This was particularly so, Ecuador contended, given Perenco's practice of building and using unreported pits (as admitted by Mr. Saltos to the *Burlington* tribunal) that were never approved or even known to the Ecuadorian authorities.739\n\nEcuador's Comments to Section 4.2 of Independent Expert Report, paragraph 2, referring to Report's Table 4.3.\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 43.\n\n650.\n\nSecond, even within the 38 sites that were investigated, it is likely that the concentrations detected in the mud pit contents by Mr. MacDonald were underestimated. Further, given the uncertainty as to the actual dimensions of the pits investigated, these dimensions had to be estimated and Mr. MacDonald had to be cautious when sampling so as \"not to penetrate the bottom of any mud pit,\"740 suggesting that the pits could, in fact, be deeper. In addition, when the depth of the mud pits was not available from the record, Mr. MacDonald assumed a depth of only 3.5 metres based on the average depth provided certain mud pit closure records. The evidence shows that this assumption, however, is insufficient to account for all the content of the pits needing remediation. For example, in Coca 18-19, 4 pits built by Perenco were 4.5 metres deep.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, p. 48.\n\n*(c) Groundwater*\n-----------------\n\n651.\n\nEcuador points out that contrary to GSI's conclusion that there was no groundwater contamination in the Blocks, the groundwater was impaired by oilfield operations above TULAS criteria for TPH and/or barium at all 12 sites investigated by Mr. MacDonald. This confirmed that groundwater was adversely affected by Perenco's oilfield operations and warrants remediation.\n\n652.\n\nMr. MacDonald's groundwater sampling campaign \u2013 which, Ecuador observed, was monitored by both Parties' experts \u2013 followed the highest industry standards, as confirmed by the fact that its results are consistent throughout the samples collected using different sampling methods (low-flow and RPPS).741 Mr. MacDonald conducted his sampling through permanent monitoring wells installed in accordance with industry best practices and tested the resulting samples against the TULAS criteria. Ecuador argues that Mr. MacDonald vindicates IEMS' criticisms of GSI's tactics to elude confirmation of groundwater impacts in the Blocks.742\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 22.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 22.\n\n653.\n\nFirst, Ecuador considers that Mr. MacDonald's groundwater monitoring well locations complied with the Tribunal's mandate. In arguing that Mr. MacDonald's sampling rationale was not be faithful to this mandate, Perenco misunderstands the mandate and the objective pursued. As explained by the Expert, an \"*exact duplication of the program previously implemented by the Parties would have provided a poor data set that would not meet the Tribunal's objectives [and] would also have cost three times as much to execute*.\"743 Further, only two monitoring wells, in Payamino 1 and Jaguar 2, are not immediately adjacent to a prior IEMS or GSI monitoring well \u2013 and the adjustments of these well locations were justified due to very high concentrations of TPH in soils at Payamino 1 and weathered crude oil at Jaguar 2.744 In any event, an impact on groundwater was also identified at both sites in the monitoring wells that were installed in the vicinity of IEMS' and GSI's monitoring wells, thus requiring groundwater remediation regardless of the results of the monitoring wells whose location is criticized by Perenco.745\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 25 and fn. 70, referring to Mr. MacDonald's 28 December 2017 letter to Perenco, p. 3, E- 453.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 25 and fn. 72: MacDonald's 28 December 2017 letter to Perenco, p. 4 (PAY01-MW03 and JAG02-MW03 \"were installed in areas where the Parties had previously collected soil samples, and where high levels of soil contamination were found by the Parties, but no wells had previously been installed [\u2026]. Evidence of crude oil was also apparent at JAG02-MW03. The lack of groundwater testing data within these two contaminated areas would represent a serious data gap that would limit my ability to assess whether groundwater contamination was present at these two affected sites.\"), E-453.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 25.\n\n654.\n\nSecond, Ecuador observes that Mr. MacDonald installed 34 state-of-the-art permanent pre-packed screened monitoring wells consistent with current industry practice to \"*address the fine-grained subsurface conditions typically encountered in the Oriente Region of Ecuador\"* and *\"to improve the quality of the sample by reducing its turbidity and ensuring that samples collected from the well were representative of groundwater.\"*746 Mr. MacDonald also took various precautions to prevent contamination from surface water encroachment. Perenco's allegation of potential soil contamination encroachment into the monitoring wells through surface waters flatly contradict GSI's position regarding the impermeability of clay soils in the area.747\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 26 & fns. 74-75, referring to the Independent Expert Report, pp. 66 and 68.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 26.\n\n655.\n\nThird, Ecuador also observes that Mr. MacDonald measured hydrocarbons in groundwater samples as per TULAS and duly considered \u2013 consistent with IEMS' approach \u2013 the sum of the GRO, DRO and ORO concentrations (whereas GSI compared the fractions individually against the TULAS limit).748\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 27.\n\n656.\n\nFourth, Ecuador affirms Mr. MacDonald's decision not to filter groundwater samples which had been obtained using Rigid Porous Polyethylene (RPP) passive samplers and low-flow sampling techniques. Notwithstanding Perenco's objections, Mr. MacDonald's decision not to filter the samples was further corroborated by the similar analytical results obtained for metals in passive and low-flow samples.749\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 28.\n\n657.\n\nFifth, Mr. MacDonald's decision not to exclude groundwater remediation based on soil clay content is supported by TULAS. Ecuadorian regulations do not indicate that groundwater in soils with greater than 25% clay and 10% organic matter should not be remediated.750 In any event, there is no available information regarding the organic matter in the samples, hence, the cumulative conditions would not be met. Mr. MacDonald's decision is justified by the fact that he was able to extract groundwater from all monitoring wells, confirming that the presence of clay in soil (even greater than 25%) does not make soils impermeable. This confirms the high probability of that contaminated groundwater is being used for drinking purposes by nearby communities and the need to ensure that such groundwater is properly remediated.751\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 29.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 29.\n\n658.\n\nIn its closing submissions, Ecuador asserted that Perenco's argument, namely, that clay content in soil above 25% would not require remediation,752 is based on a misplaced reading of the TULAS regulation which focuses on clay percentage found in each monitoring well as if they were isolated whereas Ecuadorian regulation seeks to protect groundwater throughout all the locations with potentially usable groundwater.753 As Mr. MacDonald testified, clay content can vary significantly over short distances within the same location,754 it would not be logical to restore groundwater only in locations with less than 25% clay as those areas would be re-contaminated by the contaminants in the un-remediated adjacent areas.755\n\nEcuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 29; Tr.

See Ecuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 29.\n\n659.\n\nEcuador also defends Mr. MacDonald's using a laboratory analysis method which Perenco argues could misidentify as TPH naturally occurring substances such as waxy leaves.756 First, Mr. MacDonald's testing method was the same as that used by GSI (which has made no prior complaint of the possibility that waxy organic matter could skew results). Second, Perenco's comparison between chromatograms of crude oil and dissolved phase organic constituents is not appropriate. Third, Mr. MacDonald's explanations about the detection of petroleum hydrocarbons in his groundwater samples have been consistent and are supported by substantial evidence.757\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 404:11-14.\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 404:11-405:12.\n\n660.\n\nEcuador's own criticisms about Mr. MacDonald's groundwater results are the following: Ecuador points out that the Expert was limited to \"*confirm[ing] the presence or absence of contamination*.\" The scope of his work was not designed to delineate the full extent of the groundwater impairment in the sites. Hence, in order to determine the \"*potential extent of groundwater contamination*\", Mr. MacDonald used a predictive analytical tool. The exercise performed, however, underestimates the full extent of groundwater impacts.758 In Payamino 13, for example, using the Groundwater Predictive Tool, Mr. MacDonald estimated that the identified groundwater contamination could only migrate 1.6m (and based the remediation costs on a plume dimension of only 1.6m). Yet, no identifiable potential source of contamination exists within 1.6m of the impacted monitoring wells, which confirms that the contamination had to migrate from a farther distance and the remediation costs calculated by MacDonald are underestimated. In short, groundwater contamination actually extends beyond the limited plume estimated by Mr. MacDonald.759\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 46.\n\nEcuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 27.\n\n*(d) Unit Costs*\n----------------\n\n661.\n\nEcuador considers that Mr. MacDonald's current quantification of remedial costs is the bare minimum. His estimate, which is in the conceptual phase, would be expected to be less accurate than that developed at subsequent design stages for a remediation plan. With the significant data gaps that remain to date, a contingency factor of 10% to 30% is insufficient.760\n\nEcuador's Comments to Section 6.3 of the Independent Expert Report, paragraphs 4 & 7.\n\n662.\n\nThat said, Ecuador defends Mr. MacDonald's unit cost estimates as being consistent with local quotes.761 While Perenco accuses Mr. MacDonald as only considering the US RACER database and asserting that he relied on US-based costs as exhibited in that system, Ecuador points out that Mr. MacDonald has repeatedly stated that he considered local costs and submitted evidence of that.762 RACER was only a litmus test. This is confirmed once the Hidrogeocol quote is converted for a direct comparison with Mr. MacDonald's estimate \u2013 they are very similar.763\n\nTr.

(2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 400:1-4.\n\n663.\n\nEcuador further asserts that Perenco cannot argue that Mr. MacDonald's unit costs are too high on the basis of the Ecuambiente quote, Petroamazonas' December 2018 contract with Incinerox, or what was declared in Petroamazonas' bond offering in 2006. *First*, the Ecuambiente quote is too low. *Second*, the Petroamazonas' contract is not one for remediation. *Third*, the bond offering does not provide sufficient details to allow any reliable conclusions to be drawn from it.764\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 487:19-492:16.\n\n664.\n\nPerenco also criticised Mr. MacDonald for not having prepared a bid package to establish local costs. Ecuador points out that GSI also did not prepare a bid package and that did not prevent them from quantifying the alleged remediation costs\u2013 this was admitted by Mr. Bianchi during the Expert Hearing.765\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 399:12-17.\n\n665.\n\nFinally, Ecuador supported Mr. MacDonald's proposed remediation technology for groundwater, which was criticised by Perenco, as being an appropriate choice in the circumstances.766\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 405:21-406:4.\n\n**2. Perenco's Observations on the Independent Expert's Findings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n666.\n\nPerenco asserted that Mr. MacDonald's volume and cost estimates were exaggerated. Perenco argued further that the Independent Expert Report failed to address issues that the Tribunal had directed Mr. MacDonald to study.767 For the issues that he did address, he relied on unjustified assumptions instead of on scientific and historical data, erred in his analyses, and disregarded Ecuadorian regulations and the Tribunal's own directions.768\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 1.\n\n*Id.*\n\n667.\n\nDespite the Tribunal's instructions, Mr. MacDonald has not investigated the cause of the exceedances, or, where there could be several causes, how to allocate responsibility to Perenco or any other contributor. Thus, Mr. MacDonald's US$160 million remediation cost cannot be a figure for which Perenco alone should bear responsibility.769\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 2.\n\n668.\n\nIn its submissions on the Tribunal's Independent Expert Report, Perenco focused on what it identified as nine significant deficiencies that have material financial consequences.770 In its closing submissions, Perenco grouped these issues into those relating to (1) soil volumes, (2) mud pits, (3) groundwater and (4) unit costs.771 Correcting for these errors, Perenco submitted that the overall remediation cost is no more than US$65 million, of which only US$25 million can conceivably be allocated to Perenco.772\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 3.\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 5.\n\nThe Tribunal sets out the Parties' arguments about causation and double recovery in a separate section III.F below.\n\n669.\n\nPerenco also observed that while Mr. MacDonald \"*carried out work consistent with good standards in many respects*\", he did not have experience in the *Oriente* region and was not a specialist in carrying out such projects in Ecuador.773\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 6, referring to Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 171:9-13.\n\n*(a) Soil*\n----------\n\n*(i) Land use classification*\n-----------------------------\n\n670.\n\nPerenco took issue with Mr. MacDonald's land use classifications which it asserted was based on \"*visual inspection*\"774 and which is not adequate.\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 25 and fn. 49, referring to the Independent Expert Report, p. 25.\n\n671.\n\nFirst, Mr. MacDonald's approach is contrary to the Tribunal's direction that land use classifications \"*should be guided by the Ecuadorian authorities' practice in relation to the Blocks*\" and that prior determinations by the Ecuadorian authorities have \"*significant probative value*.\"775\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 26 and fns. 51-52.\n\n672.\n\nPerenco asserted that Ecuadorian authorities have repeatedly accepted the application of \"*agricultural*\", not \"*sensitive ecosystem*\", criteria in areas surrounding platforms. IEMS conceded this. TULAS further provides that agricultural lands include those \"*classified as agricultural*\" even if they contain \"*native flora.*\"776 Despite Mr. MacDonald's assertions to the contrary, his visual inspection conclusions conflicted with those of the Ecuadorian authorities \u2013 two examples being Coca 6 and Mono CPF, where Ramboll chose 'sensitive ecosystem' even though Ecuador's own environmental impact studies acknowledged that areas surrounding the platforms had to be remediated to agricultural standards despite being surrounded by lush secondary forest.777\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 26.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 27.\n\n673.\n\nSecond, Perenco argues that Mr. MacDonald's land use classifications reveal a lack of proper spatial and temporal observations. Mr. MacDonald appears to have taken the Tribunal's guideline to apply a more stringent classification in any case of doubt as an excuse to rely on superficial or perfunctory visual observation instead of conducting a thorough investigation into how landowners and residents actually use the land over time. This ignores the full scope of the Tribunal's directions that land use classifications \"*should be reasonable in the circumstances of the particular case*.\"778\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 29 and fn. 59.\n\n674.\n\nPerenco points to three examples which were misclassified as sensitive ecosystem: Coca 10-16, where an area just north of the platform that is within a stand of trees which is actually surrounded by cleared agricultural plantations and a Petroamazonas pit farm; Payamino 10, which is actually characterised by obvious agricultural activity, large swaths of cleared areas and a pit farm which appears to contain approximately 20 pits; and Gacela 04, which is a huge Petroamazonas pipeline right of way (even Ramboll recognises that \"operating areas containing other in-use infrastructure\" are industrial lands, not 'sensitive ecosystem')779.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 32 and fn. 62, referring to the Independent Expert Report, p. 38.\n\n675.\n\nThird, Mr. MacDonald also improperly designated \"*inactive*\" sites as sensitive ecosystem. Perenco argued that the fact that a well is \"inactive\" indicates that it might be reactivated. The Tribunal held that sensitive ecosystem does not apply to a site that is \"expected to be operated for many years to come... [and] still distant from any 'posterior use.'\"780 Yet, that is what Ramboll did for instance at Lobo 4 and Jaguar 7-8, which it called sensitive ecosystem simply because the platforms are currently \"inactive.\"781\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 34 and fn. 65, referring to the Interim Decision, paragraph 490 and Perenco's Annotations to Sections 3.1 and 6.2 of the Independent Expert Report.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 34 and fn. 66.\n\n*(ii) Background calculations*\n------------------------------\n\n676.\n\nPerenco argued that Mr. MacDonald incorrectly excluded all of GSI's samples of clean soils to determine background concentrations while relying on IEMS' equivalent samples.782\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 23.\n\n677.\n\nFirst, Mr. MacDonald's exclusion of GSI's background samples because \"many\" were \"collected in the *immediate vicinity* of certain platforms and proximate to areas investigated for oilfield related impacts\" directly contravened TULAS, which specifies that samples should be taken in those areas immediately outside the area under study.783 Proximity should have been a qualifying, not a disqualifying, feature of GSI's background samples. Even if proximity were a concern, this could not justify a blanket exclusion of all 91 GSI samples; Mr. MacDonald should also have applied the same threshold to IEMS' samples, some of which were even closer to the areas of study than GSI's samples were.784 In any event, in the six sites that both IEMS and GSI sampled for background, 50% of IEMS's samples are closer to the platforms than GSI's samples \u2013 it cannot be that all of IEMS's background samples were uniformly valid whereas GSI's were not.785\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 36 and fn. 69.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 37.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 39.\n\n678.\n\nSecond, the fact that Mr. MacDonald adopted GSI's chromium background data derived from GSI's samples proves that the samples were not in fact \"too close\" to platforms. If they had been \"too close,\" they could not have yielded valid chromium data either.786\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 40.\n\n679.\n\nThird, Ramboll's exclusion of GSI's background data because GSI \"excluded a number of sample concentrations identified as high outliers from their data sets\" also makes no sense. GSI's exclusion of what it considered to be high outlier samples made their background concentrations more conservative. Even if Ramboll considered this approach to be inappropriate, the proper response was to include the outlier samples, not exclude all non-outlier samples. Indeed, Ramboll itself included the GSI outlier samples to run its statistical test and also made exactly this kind of \"correction\" to the IEMS data, which it corrected to account for \"typographical/compilation errors\" and non-detect results.787\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 41.\n\n680.\n\nFourth, Ramboll's disregard of GSI's background samples in the belief that they are drawn from a different statistical \"population\" than IEMS's background samples misapplies a statistical tool.788 Perenco argues that what the data reflect is simply the fact that Block 7, comprising more than 200,000 hectares and different geological zones, actually has many subpopulations. Such exists even within IEMS' own samples.789 Mr. MacDonald should not have rejected the GSI samples; even he acknowledged that more background samples are better.790\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 42.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 45.\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 15.\n\n*(iii)Delineation*\n------------------\n\n681.\n\nPerenco asserted that Mr. MacDonald's delineations ignored the sites' topography, active equipment and site features, and its own clean soil samples. Thus, they were inconsistent with the reality of the sites and result in over-estimating contamination.791\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 47.\n\n682.\n\nFirst, Mr. MacDonald's \"macro-delineation\" approach ignored topography as well as active equipment and site features. For instance, Ramboll's delineation in Coca 6 included a ridge bordering a drainage swale and assumed that contamination west of the ridge could somehow have extended all the way up the slope and over onto the top of the ridge.792 In Mono CPF, also shown below, Ramboll's defined remediation area included production facilities with a flare and API separator.793\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 48.\n\n*Id.*\n\n683.\n\nSecond, Mr. MacDonald's delineation included remediation of areas where Ramboll's samples showed no exceedances or where Ramboll did not even take samples. An example is Coca 02/CPF, where the delineated area included no detected exceedances at all and includes a right-of-way pipeline that Petroamazonas constructed after GSI's and IEMS's sampling campaigns.794 Perenco also pointed out that Mr. MacDonald's delineation would require remediation of ballast, which is not soil (*e.g.* in Jaguar 03), remediation of waste disposal cells (*e.g.* Payamino Sanitary Landfill) or remediation of areas with no TPH exceedances (*e.g.* Yuralpa CPF).795\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 49.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 50; Perenco's Annotations to Section 6.2 of the Independent Expert Report.\n\n*(b) Mud Pits*\n--------------\n\n684.\n\nWith respect to mud pits, Perenco argued that Ramboll ignored historical and visual evidence of synthetic liners and as a result applied the wrong regulatory criteria (*i.e*., the more stringent exceedance requirements for unlined mud pits) and exceeded the Tribunal's mandate and the Parties' due process rights by sampling pits and that the Parties had not previously sampled.796\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 23.\n\n685.\n\nPerenco criticised Mr. MacDonald for assuming \"without exception\" that Perenco's pits were unlined, contrary to the Tribunal's instruction to further investigate whether those pits were closed with impermeable liners and to \"ascertain whether the drilling muds were disposed of in a properly constructed sealed pit.\"797\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 52.\n\n686.\n\nFirst, even though Mr. MacDonald claimed that drilling through the bottom of the mud pits to confirm the existence of liners would have compromised the units if the liners were present, Mr. MacDonald could have manually excavated a shallow portion around the edge of the pit and ascertained the presence or absence of an impermeable liner on the interior side slope of the excavation.798\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 53.\n\n687.\n\nSecond, even when Ramboll observed visual evidence of liners at some mud pit perimeters, it ignored that evidence because \"*it had no information regarding its condition or latent extent*\" and \"[p]hotographs taken by Perenco at the time of closure of *some* mud pits show that an excavator was typically used to treat the mud pit material in place, which likely would have resulted in the tearing or ripping of any liner material.\"799 However, rather than treat mud pit material in place, the record shows that Perenco often mixed mud in auxiliary pits before transferring the muds to actual disposal pits, and the excavators were simply used to place mud pit materials inside the pits. This practice would not have *likely* resulted in the tearing or ripping of any liner material. Ramboll fails to consider this evidence at all.800\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 54 and fns. 105-106, referring to the Independent Expert Report, p. 73 and p. 65, fn. 142.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 54.\n\n688.\n\nThird, Ramboll should have taken into account record evidence showing that a number of Perenco's pits have impermeable synthetic liners. Contrary to Ramboll's claim that it was \"not provided any direct evidence as to whether liners are present for any specific mud pit,\" Perenco had submitted pit closure reports, photographs, and testimony demonstrating that mud pits were lined with impermeable liners.801 Perenco points to examples such as Oso 9, Coca 19 and Jaguar 9. Accordingly, several pits would meet the regulatory criteria and would not require remediation.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 55.\n\n689.\n\nPerenco also criticised Mr. Macdonald for investigating some pits that were outside of his mandate and assuming that other pits contained exceedances without having sampled them.802\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 56.\n\n690.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal instructed Mr. MacDonald to sample sites which regulatory exceedances had been identified by either or both of the Parties' experts. However, Mr. MacDonald sampled three pits in Oso 9B even though neither GSI nor IEMS went to this site. He also sampled four pits in Oso 9A, even though the only soil sample, which was collected by IEMS, showed no exceedances. Mr. MacDonald also sampled Yuralpa Sanitary Landfill Pit 2 and Yuralpa G Pit 2, even though GSI and IEMS detected no exceedances at these sites and did not gather any samples from these pits. Perenco argues that Ramboll exceeded its mandate as it had investigated Oso 9A, Oso 9B, Oso 9 Pits 2 and 4, Yuralpa Sanitary Landfill Pit and Yuralpa G Pit 2, which were not areas that had been previously investigated or sampled by IEMS or GSI.803 This was contrary to the direction in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim and the mandate identified by Mr. MacDonald in his report804 These were not areas that had been previously investigated or sampled by IEMS or GSI.805\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 21.\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 21, referring to the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 603 & the Independent Expert Report, p. 49.\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 21.\n\n691.\n\nSecond, contrary to the Tribunal's instruction, Mr. MacDonald assumed that exceedances existed in two mud pits in Oso 9 simply on the basis that the adjacent pits did not conform to the leachate criteria for lined pits, without having taken any samples from those pits and despite acknowledging that mud pits 2 and 4 were \"not investigated by either the Parties or *Ramboll*.\"806 This assumption is proven erroneous by Ramboll's own sampling which found that Pit 8 in Oso 9 met the performance criteria even though the adjacent Pit 9 did not. As a result, these nine Oso pits and two Yuralpa pits should be excluded since they are beyond the Tribunal's mandate and there is no evidence of exceedances.807\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 59.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 59.\n\n692.\n\nFurther, Perenco argued, based on pit closure reports and other contemporaneous documents, that there were liners present in properly closed pits at 18 of the mud pits in five sites.808 This implies that Perenco complied with RAOHE criteria at the time of closure. Perenco has also proven that the mud pits, or at least some segment of them, had intact liners at the time of installation and there is no legitimate specific evidence that there is any problem with those.809 Perenco also argued that IEMS' field notes either recorded references to Coca 4 and Payamino concrete pits, which were not made by Perenco, or record employees as saying that the pits were lined and they had no reason to think there were any problems with them or that they were leaking.810 As for the use of excavators, Perenco argued that it is common practice, which even Petroamazonas follows.\n\nTr.

(2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 429:8-13.\n\n693.\n\nThird, Perenco argued that Mr. MacDonald's mud pit remediation also suffered from the following technical deficiencies: Ramboll's remediation of mud pit 1 at Yuralpa Pad A, where Ramboll disregarded RAOHE's performance criteria and the pit would require no remediation under the correct criteria (Perenco argued that Table 7b criteria applied)811; Ramboll's disregard of RAOHE's instructions to test leachates for 6 PAHs (and instead applied it to the sum of 16 PAHs)812; Ramboll's finding that clean soil cover on pits needs to be remediated even though it contains no exceedances;813 and because Ramboll did not have \"specific mud pit dimensions\" for the particular pits it sampled in Oso 9A and 9B, it designated for remediation two entire pit farms comprising many pits, most of which Ramboll had not even sampled.814\n\nSee Perenco's Annotations to Section 6.2 of Independent Expert Report, pp. 196-197 of the Consolidated Expert Report.\n\nSee Perenco's Annotations to Section 6.2 of Independent Expert Report, p. 195 of the Consolidated Expert Report.\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 60 and fn. 123; see also Perenco's Annotations to Section 5.2 of Independent Expert Report, p. 94 of the Consolidated Expert Report.\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 58.\n\n*(c) Groundwater*\n-----------------\n\n694.\n\nWith regard to groundwater, Perenco argues that Mr. MacDonald disregarded express TULAS clay content criteria for groundwater samples and failed to recognise that its own lab data shows that purported TPH exceedances were due to natural organic matter, not crude oil.\n\n695.\n\nFirst, Perenco argues that Ramboll disregards TULAS' clay content rules and that TULAS does not apply when clay content is above 25%. TULAS Book VI, Annex 1, Table 5 provides that the \"reference quality criteria for groundwater\" to which it applies are \"soil with clay content between (0-25.0%).\" TULAS therefore does not provide specific criteria for aquifers with higher clay and/or organic matter content; this means that soils with a clay content higher than 25% (and an organic matter content of less than 10%) do not need to comply with the TULAS Table 5 criteria and, accordingly, that exceedances of those criteria do not constitute environmental harm if the soil has a clay content above 25%. This was not disputed by IEMS.815\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 62 and fn. 128.\n\n696.\n\nIn this regard, Perenco further relies on Mr. Bianchi's explanation given at the Expert Hearing that the clay content rules are applied straightforwardly in Ecuador.816 Mr. MacDonald's disapproval of the regulatory line drawn in Table 5 is not a valid basis for the Tribunal to deny it and, Perenco argues, the Ecuadorian regulators' decision to only require low barium content in water with less than 25% clay is rational because people do not drink water that has lots of clay or lots of organic material floating in it.817 It is a compromise as part of the balanced development and balanced environmental approach that Ecuador wants to take. In any event, IEMS' first report and other evidence show that groundwater is actually not the source of drinking water in this area and which may be another reason why this regulation made sense in the way that it was phrased.818\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slides 24, referring to Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 268:17- 269:12.\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 434:1-15.\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 434:16-20.\n\n697.\n\nOnce groundwater samples with clay content over 25% are excluded, many of Ramboll's monitoring wells show no exceedances.\n\n698.\n\nSecond, Perenco observes that Mr. MacDonald's groundwater results returned almost ubiquitous TPH \"*hits*\", even in areas where no TPH exceedances were identified in the surrounding soil, and even in areas where neither IEMS nor GSI had ever encountered TPH in their groundwater sampling. As Mr. MacDonald appeared to acknowledge, these unexplained TPH exceedances are unusual and should have raised a red flag. In fact, the type of test that Ramboll's lab ran uses a method that is not specific to petroleum from crude oil and can misidentify as TPH naturally-occurring substances like waxy leaves. Ramboll's failure to investigate this difference is especially problematic since waxy leaves are common in the Ecuadorian jungle. Had Ramboll examined chromatograms for its samples to determine whether they are really oilfield impacts or natural phenomena, it would have seen that most of them are not crude oil at all.819\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 64.\n\n699.\n\nPerenco also criticises Mr. MacDonald's modelling tool for groundwater.820 In the swampy terrain and generally low-permeability soils of Blocks 7 and 21, groundwater moves very slowly and cannot transport contaminants over significant distances, even over long time periods. The modeling tool used by Ramboll and the sensitivity analysis conducted should, by design, provide a conservative overestimate of the true plume dimensions. However, Ramboll reached a surprisingly high remediation cost of $25 million for groundwater. This incongruous result should, again, have prompted further analysis of Ramboll's results. Perenco points out three issues with Mr. MacDonald's groundwater modelling: (i) he used the three-dimensional version of the modelling software, instead of two-dimensional, it would have predicted far smaller plumes at each site; (ii) his model does not account for biodegradation of contamination over time and thus overestimates the size of the groundwater plume; (iii) for a number of plumes reported by Ramboll, no source of the plume could be identified, which is consistent with other factors that suggest that these plumes are not present and are an artifact of faulty TPH results in some cases.\n\nPerenco's Annotations to Section 6.1 of the Independent Expert Report, p. 145 of the Consolidated Expert Report.\n\n*(d) Unit Costs*\n----------------\n\n700.\n\nPerenco asserts that Ramboll's unit costs for remediation do not reflect local costs. Ramboll failed to consider actual costs spent by Petroamazonas itself for comparable remediation work, even though the Tribunal had stated that such costs are the \"best guide for estimating comparable remediation works.\"821 Ramboll's costs are inflated. Ramboll has failed, contrary to the Tribunal's directions in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim that quantification must be based on actual Ecuadorian costs.822 Perenco also complains that Ramboll never provided a copy of its quote for groundwater and soil for the Parties' verification.823\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 65 and fn. 137.\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 44; referring to Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 579 and fn. 1156.\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report, paragraph 66.\n\n701.\n\nMoreover, for soil in particular, Ramboll's unit costs bear no relationship to actual costs in Ecuador, as shown in the two quotes that Ramboll belatedly obtained as well as in Petroamazonas' own public documents. Instead, Ramboll generated its soil remediation numbers through RACER, which provides estimates based on remediation costs in the United States.824 This is in stark contradiction to the costs of Petroamazonas that they have in an actual contract, which were achieved through an appropriate method.\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 48 referring to Mr. MacDonald's testimony at Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 87:21-88:5.\n\n702.\n\nFirst, Ramboll did not analyse evidence of local costs already in the record of this proceeding or explain its basis for rejecting them. As GSI had explained, numerous remediation projects have been completed at oilfield facilities in the *Oriente* region pursuant to the requirements of RAOHE and/or TULAS and subject to review and approval by the Ecuadorian authorities, including projects by Petroecuador and other oilfield operators. At $410/m.3 Ramboll's gross unit rate for soil remediation substantially exceeds all of these government-approved remediation projects. Whereas the Tribunal acknowledged that GSI's conservative bulk cost estimate for soil remediation of $260/m\u00b3 was \"much closer\" than IEMS's to actual remediation costs in Ecuador, Ramboll's figure is inexplicably more than twice as high.\n\n703.\n\nSecond, Ramboll has ignored actual remediation costs incurred by Petroamazonas, which are readily available in public documents. In December 2018, Petroamazonas signed a contract for remediation works in Blocks 7 and 21, among others, that includes significantly lower unit costs for soil remediation: for instance, $39/m\u00b3 for treatment and disposal of soil with TPH and metals, compared to Ramboll's $160/m\u00b3. Similarly, in December 2017, Petroamazonas issued a bond offering, according to which \"[i]n 2016, Petroamazonas incurred expenses of approximately $23.1 million for the implementation of Project Amazonia Viva,\" which included the remediation of \"approximately 364,240 cubic meters of soil[] and 191 sources of pollution\" in certain blocks outside Blocks 7 and 21. These figures imply a bulk unit cost of around $63/m\u00b3, while Ramboll's corresponding bulk unit cost of $410/m3 is six times higher. The magnitude of these discrepancies between actual, recent, documented costs for work in the Blocks and surrounding areas, on the one hand, and Ramboll's software-generated black box estimate based on remediation in the United States, on the other, are indicative of the unreliability of Ramboll's overall approach and the caution with which the Tribunal should treat it.825\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 69.\n\n704.\n\nThird, Ramboll's quotes from two local contractors, Hidrogeocol Ecuador and Ecuambiente, are also not a reliable guide. Ramboll appears to have received the quotes in late November and December 2018 \u2014an entire year after it concluded the second sampling campaign in Ecuador, and barely three weeks before Mr. MacDonald submitted the Report to the Parties. Hidrogeocol's unit cost for transportation and treatment of soil contaminated with TPH and heavy metals amounts to $260/m\u00b3, six times higher than Petroamazonas's actual unit cost of $39/m\u00b3 for comparable remediation work. Similarly, Ecuambiente's unit cost for transportation and treatment of soils with just TPH is $56/m\u00b3 while Petroamazonas's actual unit cost is $46/m\u00b3 for comparable remediation work. Ramboll does not appear to have obtained a range of quotes from other contractors or to have taken account of the fact that quotes initially provided to foreign companies \u2014especially in a litigation context\u2014 are typically higher.826\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 70.\n\n705.\n\nFinally, despite having obtained these inflated quotes, no doubt because they were received so late, Ramboll did not even apply them in calculating its remediation costs. Instead, Ramboll increased certain kinds of unit costs based on no apparent reason other than its unexplained \"*professional experience*.\" In circumstances where the Tribunal has held that \"*the expert shall be guided by Ecuadorian costs*\", that is not an acceptable approach.827\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 71.\n\n706.\n\nRamboll's remediation unit costs thus do not establish the actual local costs on which remediation must be based, as the Tribunal determined. Instead, the Tribunal should apply the actual costs recently incurred by Petroamazonas itself, which provide the \"best guide for estimating comparable remediation works.\" Adjusting Ramboll's estimated unit costs to reflect Petroamazonas's actual costs for soil reduces Ramboll's soil unit costs by half. Thus, Ramboll's soil remediation cost falls from $98 million to $50 million simply by using local costs, and to approximately $40 million after all technical corrections (before allocation).828\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 72.\n\nF. **Causation and Double Recovery**\n------------------------------------\n\n707.\n\nWhile Mr. MacDonald was not instructed to investigate causation, in addition to their comments and submissions with respect to Mr. MacDonald's investigations and findings, the Parties addressed this as well as the issue of double recovery in light of the *Burlington* tribunal's decision on Ecuador's environmental counterclaim. The Parties' arguments are set out below.\n\n**1. Ecuador's arguments**\n--------------------------\n\n708.\n\nEcuador submits that the Tribunal's Interim Decision on Counterclaim is clear that the burden of proof is on Perenco.829 Therefore, if there is a regulatory exceedance, Perenco is responsible unless it can prove that some other person or an external event caused harm. Perenco has failed to discharge this burden of proof and therefore should be liable, at the very least, for the contamination confirmed by Mr. MacDonald in Blocks 7 and 21.830\n\nEcuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 5.\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, Section 3.\n\n709.\n\nFirst*,* insofar as alleged contamination caused by operators *prior* to its assuming operations in Blocks 7 and 21, Perenco has failed to prove that the extensive contamination confirmed by Mr. MacDonald was already present in the Blocks when it assumed operations in 2002.831\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 50.\n\n710.\n\nPerenco failed to point to documentary evidence confirming its theory that contamination would have been caused by prior operators: (i) Perenco failed to conduct a comprehensive written study of the environmental condition of the Blocks at the time of acquisition; (ii) neither the PSA entered into Perenco and Kerr-McGee nor Perenco's 2002 Biennial Audit suggested major environmental problems at the time; and (iii) even Perenco's 2006 and 2008 superficial and highly selective biennial audits showed a steep decline of the environmental conditions of the Blocks.832\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 50-53.\n\n711.\n\nPerenco cannot attribute the contamination to prior operators (which were limited to 23 sites only). Ecuador's responses to Perenco's allegations for five of these sites are as follows: (i) evidence on record shows that the contamination in Payamino 2-8 dates from the time of Perenco's operations; (ii) the exceedance in the swampy area southeast of Coca CPF was associated with discharge of produced water with oil residue from the API separator during Perenco's operations, as confirmed by Mr. MacDonald and acknowledged by Mr. Salto before the *Burlington* tribunal; (iii) 1999 spill in Coca 6 migrated to the southwest of the platform, whilst the area to be remediated identified by Mr. MacDonald is located to the southeast of the platform; (iv) the *Burlington* tribunal held Perenco responsible for the remediation of the Coca 8 pit; and (v) GSI inspected the pit in Payamino 4 and attested that there was no leakage \u2013 therefore, any contamination could not be related to this pit.833\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 55.\n\n712.\n\nWith respect to Perenco's denial of liability for 19 sites based on a \"simplistic argument\" that the exceedances in these sites mostly related to heavy metals and pit areas and therefore were caused by drilling pre-dating its operatorship, Ecuador argues that this assumption is unsupported.834 For example, Perenco argues that barium exceedances could only arise from original drilling activities. However, Perenco conducted numerous workovers and its admitted practice of transporting drilling muds from one site to another for storage, both of which are likely to have caused the exceedances found.835 In Yuralpa A, Perenco itself also drilled in the period 2003-2006 and should know whether its drilling caused contamination on this site.836 There were also numerous unreported oil spills during Perenco's operations and there is no evidence that these were properly remediated.837 Perenco now accepts that at least part of the contamination in Jaguar 1 was caused by an unreported spill during the time of its operations and it drilled in Coca 19 in 2003, where Mr. MacDonald confirmed soil contamination and non-conforming Perenco-associated pits.838\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 56.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 57.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 58.\n\n713.\n\nMoreover, if Perenco really wanted to identify the cause and timing of the TPH exceedances found, it could have conducted (as it had an ample opportunity to do pre- and post-July 2009) a hydrocarbon fingerprinting analysis or other laboratory forensic technique. At the least, the tests would be able to show whether a particular release was fresh or very dated such that it would be pre- or post-Perenco operations.839\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 60.\n\n714.\n\nFurther, Perenco inherited all environmental liability for any pre-existing conditions present in the Blocks.840\n\nEcuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 10.\n\n715.\n\nEcuador submits further that Perenco-associated pits were found to be non-compliant at all of the sites investigated by MacDonald.841 This finding is unsurprising and confirms that Perenco's poor practices extend to its location, construction, use and management of pits. There can, thus, be no doubt, that these exceedances are attributable to Perenco. Ecuador further argues that Perenco is liable, at the very least, for the complete remediation of all the mud pits investigated by Mr. MacDonald because: (i) Perenco has the burden of proof regarding the placement of proper pits as it would have such records, but has failed to discharge it;842 and (ii) there were many more mud pits that Mr. MacDonald should have, but did not, investigate.843\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 61.\n\nEcuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 18.\n\n*Ibid.*, Slide 19.\n\n716.\n\nSecond, with respect to alleged contamination caused by Petroamazonas (\"PAM\") after it assumed operations in Blocks 7 and 21, Perenco is not able to prove that any contamination identified by Mr. MacDonald is attributable to Petroamazonas. Perenco has referred to only one incident at Mono CPF in 2011 that that would allegedly be the source of the contamination in one of the areas in that site. However, the limited contents of that 2011 spill make their way to the opposite end of the platform due to the terrain gradient (*i.e*., the northeast and not the southeast of the platform, where the contaminated area confirmed by Mr. MacDonald is located), but it is also chronologically impossible for the contamination delineated by the Expert to result from a 2011 PAM spill, given that, already during their first field campaign in October 2010, IEMS had collected samples showing TPH exceedances in the same area as Mr. MacDonald.844 Other than this isolated incident, Perenco's only other claim is that Petroamazonas' new works overtook areas at 9 other sites.845\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 64.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 63.\n\n717.\n\nIn any event, the evidence on record, including the documents recently disclosed by Ecuador, confirms that Petroamazonas neither caused nor contributed to the contamination. *First*, 11 of the sites and all the pits identified for remediation have not been operated or used by Petroamazonas.846*Second*, as Mr. MacDonald performed a gap filling exercise, the contamination he found is the same identified by IEMS (and others, like Walsh and GSI) since 2010. *Third*, none of those who conducted inspections from 2010 to 2017 observed any environmental incidents after July 2009 and Mr. MacDonald's report does not mention any signs of recent contamination observed during Ramboll's investigations.847*Fourth*, documents recently produced by Ecuador confirm that there were no incidents reported during Petroamazonas' operations in 30 sites identified for remediation. For those sites where an incident occurred, those incidents could not be the cause of the harm as they occurred at different locations from Mr. MacDonald's remediation locations and were, in any event, promptly remediated by Petroamazonas.848\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraphs 66 and 68.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 70.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 71.\n\n718.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's invitation for comments regarding a possible general discounting factor to account for Petroamazonas' possible contribution to the environmental harm,849 Ecuador makes the following two submissions.\n\nProcedural Order No. 17.\n\n719.\n\nFirst, as set out above, Petroamazonas has neither caused nor contributed to the harm identified by Mr. MacDonald, and save for two areas in Coca CPF and Coca 1, none of the areas identified for remediation were overtaken by Petroamazonas' new works.850 Perenco's complaint that Ecuador has failed to disclose some of Petroamazonas' spills relates to spills either introduced by Ecuador into the record, outside the scope of the Tribunal's order for document production or were addressed in Ecuador's letter of 11 March 2019 and now also part of the record.851\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report, paragraph 74.\n\nEcuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 47-48, Tr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 412:5-18.\n\n720.\n\nSecond, careful consideration should be given to how the Tribunal determines a discounting factor if nonetheless the Tribunal were still minded to grant it. Ecuador anticipates difficulties and perverse incentives if the Tribunal were to allocate responsibility for groundwater based on the amount of time that each operator ran the Blocks because: (i) this rewards an operator who concealed the existence of contamination for years and tactically seeks to deny liability such that it would be able to share responsibility with the next operator;852 (ii) a linear time-based rule would unfairly impose exclusively on Ecuador the burden of the time taken by Mr. MacDonald for completing his report; and (iii) this assumes the same amount of contamination is generated every year regardless of each operator's practices, but the Tribunal cannot assume that Petroamazonas operates under the same low standards employed by Perenco.853\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report, paragraph 76.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 78.\n\n721.\n\nFinally, Ecuador confirms that it is not seeking double recovery for the environmental harm in the Blocks. It submits that Mr. MacDonald has not found the \"same harm\" as the *Burlington* tribunal and Perenco, therefore, remains liable for the additional and/or different remedial areas, volumes and costs. In its submissions, Ecuador provided a site-by-site comparison of areas, depth, volumes and costs to identify overlaps adopting a conservative approach. Its accompanying explanations specific to soil, mud pits and groundwater are as follows.\n\n722.\n\n**Soil** : no overlap can exist in relation to (i) sites for which the *Burlington* tribunal did not award any remedial costs; (ii) sites where Mr. MacDonald delineated different areas; (iii) sites or areas where Mr. MacDonald's sampling has confirmed contamination extends beyond or deeper than the *Burlington* tribunal's findings; (iv) sites or areas where the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination estimated by Mr. MacDonald and the *Burlington* tribunal are similar, but for which Mr. MacDonald estimates higher remediation costs.\n\n723.\n\n**Mud pits** : the *Burlington* tribunal awarded only US$11,106,050 for the remediation of mud pits at five sites (two of which were not considered by the Expert). Conversely, Mr. MacDonald concluded that (i) additional mud pits warrant remediation, and (ii) higher remediation costs \u2013 with respect to those awarded by the *Burlington* tribunal \u2013 would be required for remediating mud pits at C\u00f3ndor Norte (US$2,484,000 by Mr. MacDonald v. US$1,070,000 in *Burlington*) and the Payamino WTS (US$2,978,000 by Mr. MacDonald v. 2,025,000 in *Burlington*). Hence, Perenco is liable for the higher remediation costs at C\u00f3ndor Norte and Payamino WTS (*i.e.*, US$2,367,000) as well as the full remediation costs estimated for non-compliant mud pits at 11 sites.\n\n724.\n\n**Groundwater** : the *Burlington* tribunal awarded only US$5,040,000 for groundwater remediation at Coca CPF, Payamino 14/20/24 and Payamino 15 (*i.e.*, US$1,680,000 per site). Conversely, Mr. MacDonald concluded that nine additional sites require groundwater remediation and estimated higher costs for the remediation of Coca 2/CPF (US$3,001,000 by Mr. MacDonald v. US$1,680,000 in *Burlington*). Perenco is, therefore, liable for the difference in groundwater remediation costs for Coca 2/CPF (US$1,321,000) as well as the full remediation costs estimated by Mr. MacDonald for the nine additional sites.\n\n725.\n\nFinally, as it pertains to the well abandonment costs claimed by Ecuador for the seven sites in Perenco's November 2008 Well Site Abandonment Plan that it never carried out (and that PAM has never operated), Ecuador is entitled to any abandonment costs in addition to the US$929,722 granted by the *Burlington* tribunal.\n\n726.\n\nBased on Ecuador's calculations, therefore, it is entitled to recover US$130,801,100 from Perenco.854\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **POTENTIAL MAXIMUM REMEDIATION COSTS SUBJECT TO DOUBLE RECOVERY** | **POTENTIAL REMEDIATION COSTS** **NOT** **SUBJECT TO DOUBLE RECOVERY** |\n| **Soil - Block 7** | -15 714 000 USD | 80 759 000 USD |\n| **Soil - Block 21** | -495 900 USD | 1 454 100 USD |\n| **Mud pits** | -8 412 000 USD | 28 304 000 USD |\n| **Groundwater** | -4 457 000 USD | 20 284 000 USD |\n| **TOTALS** | **-29 078 900 USD** | **130 801 100 USD** |\n\n*Ibid.*, Appendix A.\n\n**2. Perenco's arguments**\n--------------------------\n\n727.\n\nIn sum, Perenco argues that it cannot be liable at all for harm it did not cause; it cannot be solely liable for harm to which others contributed; and it certainly cannot be presumed to be liable for any conditions observed in the Blocks only years after its departure.855 The fact that sampling found exceedances in Blocks 7 and 21 many years after Perenco's investment there was expropriated is not proof that Perenco caused those exceedances, and without proof of causation, there simply is no liability.\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 14.\n\n728.\n\nPerenco argues that the Tribunal decided in its Interim Decision on Counterclaim that the \"onus of proof is on a party who makes an allegation\" and that it is Ecuador who must disprove that Petroamazonas caused exceedances.856 Ecuador's failure to do so cannot be remedied by presuming causation.857 Perenco can only be *prima facie* liable for exceedances identified during Perenco's operatorship and can relieve itself of liability by demonstrating that someone else caused the harm. This must mean that Petroamazonas as the current operator is strictly liable for harm save insofar as it can demonstrate that, in this case, Perenco, caused the harm.\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 59.\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 8.\n\n729.\n\nThere is no more reason to presume that Perenco, as one of several past operators, is liable for conditions identified years after it was ousted than to presume that any other prior operator is liable for them.858 It would be unjust to do so when Petroamazonas has extensively developed the Blocks, turned forests into pit farms, dug up soils designated for remediation to make rights-of-way for new pipelines, and experienced dozens of spills that were only recently disclosed and even more which were not.859 There are also no inequities on the facts of the case that justifies the shifting of the burden of proof to Perenco.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 11.\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 12.\n\n730.\n\nAccording to Perenco, the adjustment of Ramboll's remediation costs for causation would reduce those costs by almost a third.\n\n731.\n\nFirst, most of the identified exceedances were caused by prior operators: (i) exceedances identified by Ramboll are largely associated with barium which in turn is associated with drilling that occurred prior to Perenco's operatorship \u2013 Perenco did not drill wells in many of the sites where soil exceedances were detected, including seven of the eight \"inactive\" sites that the Tribunal had identified; (ii) at least some of the TPH exceedances also stem from Ecuador's or other operators' tenure, *e.g.* Payamino 2-8, where a major environmental incident occurred during CEPE's operatorship, or Coca 6, where major spills occurred in 1999 and later in 2011; (iii) that is likewise the case for groundwater at sites where Ramboll identified barium exceedances, which can only be causally related to production well drilling, but where Perenco did not drill wells; and incidents that may have led to TPH contamination did not occur during Perenco's operations, *e.g.* Payamino 4-14, where Perenco did not drill wells and no TPH were identified in the 2011-2013 sampling campaigns.860\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 17.\n\n732.\n\nSecond, for the sites where Perenco may have contributed to the exceedances, there will inevitably be difficulties in allocating liability between Perenco and Ecuador. Perenco submits that the application of a discounting factor based on length of operatorship may be appropriate for both soil and groundwater. Such a discounting factor must, however, take into account the full history of operations at the given site, and cannot begin simply in 2002. The effluxion of time alone means that, for example, for groundwater, more than 70% of the remediation costs must be allocated to Ecuador.861\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 18.\n\n733.\n\nThird, for mud pit remediation, the Tribunal recognised that Perenco's liability is limited to the contents of the mud pits that Perenco built and used. Perenco cannot be held solely liable, however, for pit cover material (which Ramboll has treated as ordinary soil) that shows near-surface exceedances unrelated to Perenco's drilling of the associated wells.862 Perenco further notes that there were mud pits which were already closed by the time of Perenco's operations.863\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 19.\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slides 22.\n\n734.\n\nPerenco submits that it is not surprising that Perenco contributed to only a fraction of the issues identified in the Blocks. Environmental standards and practices were different in the 1980s and 1990s than they were during Perenco's operatorship.864 Perenco's involvement in the Blocks was comparatively limited, both in time and in nature. Perenco's tenure lasted less than seven years compared to the 49 years that Block 7 and the Coca-Payamino Unified Field have been in operation and 47 years for some areas in Block 21. Petroamazonas has since developed the Blocks far more aggressively and has more than doubled the impact that Perenco could have.865\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 20.\n\n*Id.*\n\n735.\n\nPerenco proposes that the following principles of allocation be adopted:\n\n(a) **Pits** : 100% attributed to Perenco;\n\n(b) **Groundwater** : allocation by ratio of time;\n\n(c) **Soil** : in summary, according to the type of soil exceedance, which might be categorized as follows: (i) barium only or barium with other metals (but no TPH); (ii) barium with TPH only (no other metals); (iii) barium, TPH and other metals; (iv) TPH only (no barium, no other metals) or other metals only (no barium, no TPH).866\n\nPerenco's Table 1 Soil Cost Allocation Methodology, Annotated Report, p. 13.\n\n736.\n\nThe application of these principles would result in remedial costs of US$25,600,465:867\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Ramboll Estimate** | **With Causation Adjustment** | **With Technical and Causation Adjustments** |\n| **Soil** | **$98,423,000** | **$23,310,662** | **$10,468,602** |\n| **Pits** | **$36,715,000** | **$36,607,370** | **$14,865,533** |\n| **Groundwater** | **$24,742,000** | **$5,835,619** | **$266,330** |\n| **Total** | **$159,880,000** | **$65,753,651** | **$25,600,465** |\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 94.\n\n737.\n\nPerenco submits that this is reasonable and likely high. Its proposed methodology: (i) adjusts soil volumes at only 16 of Ramboll's 49 sites; (ii) allocates to Perenco 60% of the cost for Payamino 2-8; (iii) allocates to Perenco full responsibility for barium exceedances at sites Perenco drilled, even though Petroamazonas may have done workovers there; (iv) allocates to Perenco full responsibility for mud pits it built or used, even though approved pit closure reports show there was no fault, and even though Petroamazonas may also have used them; (v) allocates to Perenco its share of responsibility for metals-only exceedances, even if there is no barium or TPH to link them to oil operations; and (v) includes a cost contingency of up to 30%, despite Ramboll having filled gaps with another thousand samples.868\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 95.\n\n738.\n\nPerenco submits that this figure of US$25 million should be further adjusted in light of the Consortium's US$42 million settlement payment. This payment must be deducted from the total remediation cost to avoid double recovery*.* This would lead to an award of zero damages if all adjustments are applied.869\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 73.\n\n739.\n\nEven if the corrected unit costs allocated to Perenco were to exceed US$42 million, the Tribunal should order that Ecuador cannot simply offset any such residual remediation cost from the damages it owes to Perenco, but that it must deposit that amount, along with its share of the overall remediation costs, in a remediation fund that Ecuador must use solely for the purpose of remediating the Blocks.870 This is the only way to ensure that the Tribunal's objective of protecting the environment is truly achieved, that Ecuador fulfills its promises to use the funds to remediate, and that the entire counterclaims process is not subverted for Ecuador's opportunistic monetary gain, it should not reduce Perenco's damages but be paid into a remediation fund.871\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 75.\n\n*Id.*\n\nG. **The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. The Tribunal's view of the Expert's work**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n740.\n\nAs can be seen from the summary of the Parties' submissions, many issues were raised by one Party or the other which bear upon the quantification of damages. The Tribunal considers that these ranged from the important to the irrelevant.872 To the extent that the Tribunal does not expressly deal with an issue raised by a Party, that does not mean that it has not been considered.\n\nAs an example of the latter, the Tribunal saw no value in Perenco's attempt to diminish the Expert's work by reason of his lack of prior experience in Ecuador. It was the Parties themselves who identified, interviewed, and proposed Mr. MacDonald to the Tribunal. Both Parties were aware of his experience, which is extensive, and includes work in other Latin American countries. The fact that he had not previously worked in Ecuador is of no import or relevance.\n\n741.\n\nTo begin, the Tribunal addresses the overall quality and reliability of the Report. The Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. MacDonald and his team from Ramboll acted impartially and independently and with a high level of technical proficiency. Mr. MacDonald began his work by performing an intensive data review exercise in order to familiarise himself with the work previously done by the Parties' experts and with the Tribunal's findings in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim.873 During his testimony at the Expert Hearing, he indicated that he also consulted local advisors and counsel in Ecuador in an effort to fully inform himself of the regulatory regime so as to be able to discharge his mandate.874 When it came to estimating remediation costs, Mr. MacDonald engaged a local consultant, Hidrogeocol Ecuador, to assist in obtaining quotations for remedial work.875\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, p. 2: \"My findings and opinions are based upon documents provided by the Tribunal and the Parties, as listed in Section 8.0, supplemented by my visits to representative sites in Blocks 7 and 21 during October/November 2016 and again during fieldwork performed in the fall of 2017. I also relied upon various regulatory documents, standards, and scholarly and technical publications that are applicable to this matter. Finally, under my direction, Ramboll generated independent data and performed the relevant technical analyses to close significant data gaps in the investigation of soils and generated a technically valid data set to replace prior groundwater data gathered by the Parties. Under my direction, Ramboll also conducted work needed to document the compliance status of mud pits previously used by Perenco with applicable Ecuadorian regulations.\"\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 269:15-19: \"\u2026I was not precluded from reading the regulations, interpreting them, nor of having conversations with other consultants in Ecuador, including environmental counsel where I was pushing and probing.\"\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 85:19-21.\n\n742.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal addressed the principal issues of Ecuadorian environmental law in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, certain secondary issues remained to be addressed by the Expert in discharging his mandate. The Tribunal considers that he made reasonable decisions within the framework of Ecuadorian environmental law and administrative practice.\n\n743.\n\nMr. MacDonald and Ramboll conducted the sampling exercise transparently and considered suggestions made by the Parties' experts and representatives.876 The Consolidated Independent Expert Report noted in this regard:\n\n\"It is important to note that the Parties have had the opportunity to pose questions and comment on my work throughout this engagement, including before and during the performance of the field campaign. In addition, representatives of the Parties were present during all onsite activities, including the initial exploratory visit to the Blocks as well as during the performance of sample mark-outs and collection of samples from all investigated media. The field program was implemented over a four-month period and issues raised by the Parties during that time were always considered; in certain cases, my approach was adjusted to incorporate expanded information or to address concerns (when these were reasonable and technically valid). It was not always possible to reach full agreement with both Parties, as their commitments to their clients and strategic approaches differed from my own. However, in all cases, a respectful dialogue was established with both Parties, and to my knowledge neither expressed concerns regarding bias for or against either Party in this matter. Relevant correspondence, emails, and other documentation of this dialogue between the Parties and myself or field personnel is included in Appendix B.\"877\n\nMr. MacDonald noted that: \"there was significant communications with the Parties, both legal counsel, as well as their Experts, in advance of the site work. There were frequent briefings with the Parties during the site work, all right, routine written and verbal communications responding to questions and careful consideration of all matters raised by the Parties, with adjustments made where we thought reasonable and appropriate.\" Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 21:21-22:7. See also his Direct Presentation, Slide 4, where he adverted to communications with the Parties before the site work was conducted, frequent briefings with the Parties during the site work, routine written and verbal communications to respond to questions or concerns raised by the Parties, and consideration of all matters raised by the Parties, with adjustments made where reasonable.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, Section 1.3.\n\n744.\n\nMr. MacDonald acknowledged that he did not accept every suggestion from a Party, but that is hardly surprising, given how far apart the Parties' experts were in their own approaches and findings.878 Moreover, again unsurprisingly, in a few instances, due to technical considerations, he chose not to precisely replicate a location at a site where one or the other of the Parties' experts had taken a particular sample; this was the case in relation to two groundwater monitoring wells (at PAY01-MW03 and PAY04-MW03).879\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 1: \"The underlying technical investigations performed by each Party were based on differing conceptual frameworks, with Ecuador taking a more traditional due diligence approach with Phase II site investigation activities, while Perenco performed follow-up confirmatory, delineation and/or risk assessment studies. Further, in several cases, the Parties interpreted applicable regulations in different ways, conducted their fieldwork and data analysis using inconsistent protocols, and where similar remedial approaches were considered, developed dissimilar cleanup costs. Together, the investigations and evaluations did not provide the Tribunal with an adequate or consistent set of facts that could be used in their deliberations.\"\n\nSee Consolidated Expert Report, p. 68 \u2013 at two sites, the parties had not installed wells at locations- previous placement was not appropriate and adjusted the locations, *i.e*. Pay01-MW03 in REC 66 and JAG02-MW03. See also the letter of 28 December 2017 which states that 65% of groundwater wells were proposed in the immediate vicinity of wells previously installed by one or both Parties. Are located next to wells \u2013 22/34 of the proposed wells. For 12 of 34 locations at nine sites, 5 were placed within site areas that were previously subjected to groundwater testing, but not at the exact locations of prior wells: 4 were located in areas with significant data gaps; 3 were placed near prior wells that had been previously installed within mud pits and to correct for contamination.\n\n745.\n\nThe Parties were, as already noted, given an opportunity to make written submissions and insert comments into the Independent Expert Report. They were also given the opportunity to cross-examine Mr. MacDonald on both days of the two-day Expert Hearing. Mr. MacDonald was a careful, credible, knowledgeable and objective expert witness.\n\n746.\n\nThe Tribunal notes further that the Parties collected \"split groundwater samples.\"880 The Parties were thus free to employ their own laboratory analyses to check the Expert's results. Although both Parties have criticisms of the Report (Perenco being more critical of his work than Ecuador), with one significant exception,881 neither Party challenged the results of the laboratory testing.882 The Tribunal therefore considers that the handling of the samples, from extracting them at site through to transporting them to ALS, and their further analysis in Houston, Texas, was conducted in accordance with best practices and therefore rendered the technical evaluation of the samples valid, accurate and reliable.\n\nThe only qualification to this statement concerns the taking of groundwater samples where it was necessary due to the low flow rate for the splitting of the samples to be done sequentially. Thus, by agreement of the Parties, the Expert took the first sample from a particular groundwater well, the second sample went to IEMS and the third sample went to GSI. See Expert's Direct Presentation, Slide 67.\n\nPerenco alleged that the type of test that Ramboll's laboratory used to detect total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH; sum of GRO, DRO and MRO), was \"not specific to petroleum from crude oil\" and \"known to misidentify naturally-occurring plant waxes and insoluble paraffin wax, which fall in the same carbon range as petroleum on this analysis\" and that there were stark differences between his analysis and what GSI found. The Expert addressed this during his Direct Presentation, starting at Slide 67, which noted that \"Neither IEMS nor GSI has made their data available, nor provided necessary detail; thus, cannot comment on what is described as remarkably different results.\" Both Parties collected split ground water samples as part of Ramboll's 2017 field campaign, but their analytical data from that split sampling was never provided to the Expert by either Party so that the allegedly \"stark differences\" could be evaluated by him. In addition, the testing method used (EPA Method SW-8015C) was agreed to by both Parties in advance and had been used previously by GSI in its work.\n\nThe Tribunal considers such issues as the Parties' disagreements over Mr. MacDonald's treatment of background criteria, combining (or not) of data sets, use of the \"upper predictive limit\" method, the \"chromatogram issue\", the use of inference, predictive tools, macro-delineation, and contingencies to estimate the extent of contamination (and sensitivity analyses to confirm estimates), the merits and demerits of different methods of compositing soil samples, and so on to fall squarely within the province of expertise and interpretation of results. These are quintessentially technical matters that the Expert dealt with and the Tribunal accepts his views on these matters.\n\n747.\n\nTo be sure, like the Parties, the Tribunal had questions about certain decisions taken by the Independent Expert. This was inevitable, given the manifold uncertainties inherent in estimating a single operator's legal responsibility for its slice of contamination that resulted from oilfield operations conducted in some parts of the Blocks for many years (particularly in Block 7 and the Coca-Payamino unified field).883 The Tribunal's views on the Expert's determination of certain disputed issues is addressed below.\n\nAlthough there had been exploratory drilling in the Yuralpa and Oso fields, Perenco was the first operator to really develop them.\n\n748.\n\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Tribunal reviewed the Consolidated Independent Expert Report, the Parties' separate written submissions, as well as the testimony and closing submissions given at the Expert Hearing. Most of the questions and objections that the Parties have raised concern technical matters that fall within the Expert's expertise and judgement and the Tribunal considers that it is not appropriate to second-guess his technical determinations. That is why he was appointed in the first place: to provide, in an objective and neutral fashion, the expertise and judgement which the Tribunal considered the Parties' experts had failed to provide.\n\n749.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that it is necessary for it to deal only with two major sets of issues. The first set of issues concerns how to determine Perenco's share of the responsibility for remediating the contamination in the Blocks (as between Perenco and its predecessors and successor). The second set of issues concerns the scope of the Expert's mandate and whether he acted consistently with it.\n\n**2. Causation and attribution of responsibility**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n750.\n\nMr. MacDonald's estimation of the cost of remediating the \"total measured contamination\"884 in Blocks 7 and 21 amounts to US$159,881.00.885 The central question for the Tribunal is how much of this contamination is Perenco's responsibility.886\n\nBy \"total measured contamination\", the Tribunal means that amount of contamination which the Expert defined from prior investigations and his sampling in the Blocks as per the instructions of the Tribunal. Due to the limitations on his mandate, it is not to be taken as a complete estimation of total contamination in the Blocks because there could be contamination that was not detected by either of the Parties' experts and Mr. MacDonald was restricted to working on the sites that they had examined.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, Table 6.11. Summary of Remedial Cost Estimates.\n\nThroughout this section of the Award, the Tribunal discusses different operators' \"responsibility.\" Of course, the Tribunal only has Perenco and Ecuador before it. It can identify contamination which is attributable to the acts of Perenco's predecessors, but it lacks jurisdiction to assess damages payable by non-parties to the arbitration.\n\n751.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that the Expert's work should be focused on estimating the total measured contamination in the Blocks, leaving it to the Tribunal to decide the issues of causation and the resulting division of responsibility for remediation costs as between Perenco and other operators.887\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 591: \"\u2026 the Tribunal recognises that the conditions likely to exist in 2015 might have been affected by the actions of Petroamazonas. It might therefore be necessary for the Tribunal to determine Perenco's share of any responsibility for contamination in order to ensure that it is not made responsible for the acts of Petroamazonas.\"\n\n752.\n\nThe Interim Decision on Counterclaim made the following findings on how Perenco's responsibility would be fixed:\n\n\"While it [the Tribunal] agrees with Perenco that it cannot presume that Perenco is the author of all harm that has been detected, once a regulatory exceedance resulting from a potentially hazardous activity is shown, Perenco is *prima facie* responsible therefor.888\n\nThe Tribunal is thus inclined to employ a strong rebuttable presumption that if there is a regulatory exceedance, that in itself is evidence of fault. Any alternative approach would make it too onerous for a claimant because it would likely lack sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the operator failed in its duty of care in many if not most instances in which regulatory exceedances have occurred. The Tribunal considers that regulatory exceedances are indicative of operational failures and therefore should be taken as falling below the standard of care.889\n\nIn sum, if a regulatory exceedance occurred, Perenco is to be taken to have fallen below the requisite duty of care and will be held liable unless it can prove on a preponderance of evidence: (i) an occurrence of a *force majeure* event; (ii) that it did not fall below the standard of care in respect of that specific instance of contamination; or (iii) that some other person caused the harm.\"890 [Emphasis added.]\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 372.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 374.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 379.\n\n753.\n\nIn its comments on the Independent Expert Report and at the Expert Hearing, Perenco focused mainly on persuading the Tribunal that other operators are responsible for most of the contamination that has been determined by the Expert. Perenco's case was that its seven-year operatorship was sandwiched between other operations conducted by other operators for longer periods of time and therefore most of the damage found by the Expert must be attributed to those operators.\n\n754.\n\nFirst, Perenco argued that most of the identified exceedances were attributable to prior operators because barium, which is associated with drilling, was identified and most of the well drilling occurred prior to Perenco's operatorship. Perenco also argued that at least some of the TPH exceedances stemmed from Ecuador's or other operators' tenures, during which major incidents had occurred.891\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 17.\n\n755.\n\nSecond, for sites where it is difficult to allocate liability between Perenco and Ecuador, Perenco submitted that the application of a discounting factor based on length of operatorship may be appropriate, taking into account the full history of operations at a given site.892\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 18.\n\n756.\n\nThird, Perenco accepted its liability with regard to the contents of the mud pits that it had built and used. However, it contended that it cannot be held solely liable for pit cover material that showed near-surface exceedances unrelated to Perenco's drilling of the associated wells.893 It also denied liability for mud pits which were already closed by the time of Perenco's operations.894\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 19.\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 22.\n\n757.\n\nAt paragraph 735 above, the Tribunal has reproduced Perenco's proposed principles for allocating responsibility and they will not be repeated here.895\n\n*Ibid*., Slide 93.\n\n758.\n\nEcuador took a very different view from Perenco, arguing that Perenco was under a duty to maintain the Blocks in good condition, which included remediating any environmental incidents as well as properly locating and constructing and/or closing mud pits.896 However, Perenco \"ran low-cost operations focused on extracting all the crude it could as fast as possible and at minimum cost, in complete disregard of the environment.\"897 Ecuador argued that Perenco had failed to prove that the contamination (which was a minimum estimate898) was caused by prior operators or by Petroamazonas.\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 2: \"Such extensive contamination obviously came as no surprise to Perenco, given its previously established sub-standard management of the Blocks, the numerous spills and other environmental incidents during its operatorship, its inadequate steps (to the extent undertaken) to remediate these incidents, its practice of concealing (or, at the very least not reporting) such incidents to the authorities, its inadequately located, constructed and/or closed mud pits, and its general failure to properly maintain the Blocks' facilities, including the flowlines, pipelines and tanks containing crude oil.\"\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 2.\n\nAs Ecuador stated in its comments in the Consolidated Expert Report, p. 22: \"MacDonald's conclusions should thus be viewed as the minimum discovered remedial needs.\"\n\n759.\n\nFirst, according to Ecuador, contemporaneous documents did not show environmental issues in the Blocks when Perenco took over. They also showed that the conditions of the Blocks declined and incidents occurred during Perenco's operatorship.899 Further, Perenco's argument attributing responsibility to other operators based on barium was unsupported900 and in any event, could have been caused by Perenco's workovers and transporting of drilling muds for storage.901 Perenco could have done tests to assess the timing of TPH exceedances (but it did not do so). In addition, incidents occurring prior to Perenco's operatorship occurred outside Mr. MacDonald's remediation locations.902 In any event, Perenco inherited all environmental liability for any pre-existing conditions present in the Blocks.903\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraphs 50-53.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 56.\n\n*Id.*\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 55.\n\nEcuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 10.\n\n760.\n\nEcuador argued further that Perenco also cannot attribute contamination to Petroamazonas because 11 of the sites and all mud pits identified for remediation were not operated or used by Petroamazonas.904 Mr. MacDonald's gap-filling exercise confirmed the contamination found by IEMS and there were no new contamination incidents observed either during post-July 2009 inspections or by Ramboll.905 Incidents occurring during Petroamazonas' operatorship took place at different locations or were such that they could not have caused the contamination found, and in any event, were promptly remediated.906\n\nEcuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraphs 66 and 68.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 70.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 71.\n\n761.\n\nSecond, Ecuador submitted that the allocation of responsibility for groundwater based on amount of time of each operatorship would: (i) reward an operator who concealed the existence of contamination for years and tactically seeks to deny liability such that it would be able to share responsibility with the next operator;907 (ii) also unfairly impose exclusively on Ecuador the burden of the time taken by Mr. MacDonald to complete his report; and (iii) assume the same amount of contamination is generated every year regardless of each operator's practices, but the Tribunal cannot assume that Petroamazonas operates under the same low standards as Perenco.908\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 76.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 78.\n\n762.\n\nThird, Ecuador argued that Perenco is liable, at the very least, for the complete remediation of all the mud pits investigated by Mr. MacDonald because: (i) Perenco has the burden of proof regarding the placement of proper pits as it would have such records, but has failed to discharge that burden;909 and (ii) there were many more mud pits that Mr. MacDonald should have investigated, but did not.910\n\nEcuador's Closing Presentation, Slide 18.\n\n*Ibid.,* Slide 19.\n\n*(a) The Tribunal's Findings*\n-----------------------------\n\n763.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, as reflected in Perenco's general approach, there are two temporal aspects to the causation issue. The Tribunal accordingly begins with two fundamental principles.\n\n764.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal agrees with Perenco that it cannot be held responsible for any contamination caused by Petroamazonas after it took over the Blocks in July 2009. As the Interim Decision on Counterclaim stated:\n\n\"368. The Tribunal recognises that with the passage of time, in the course of conducting oilfield operations, Petroamazonas might have caused spills and other contamination. The key period of time was that falling between July 2009 and the time in which the Parties' experts conducted their sampling activities. During this period, it is possible that the condition of the Blocks could have been adversely affected by the succeeding operator and this must be borne in mind. To the extent that there is any evidence of environmental harm occurring in the Blocks during the post 16 July 2009 period, Perenco bears no liability. Under the 2008 Constitution, Petroamazonas is strictly liable for any such contamination.\"911\n\nAnd:\n\n\"370. The Tribunal finds that the only remediation obligation that Perenco can have is for regulatory exceedances that predate Petroamazonas' activities and which themselves have not been overtaken by Petroamazonas' new works.\"912 [Emphasis added.]\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 368.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 370.\n\n765.\n\nSecond, although Perenco is *prima facie* liable for all contamination in the Blocks, it cannot be held responsible for any contamination that the evidence shows was caused by other operators prior to its assumption of operations in 2002.\n\n766.\n\nThe Tribunal will discuss each in turn.\n\n*(b) The Petroamazonas issue*\n-----------------------------\n\n767.\n\nThe Tribunal is alive to the possibility that given the effluxion of time, Petroamazonas could have caused contamination that could be erroneously attributed to Perenco. Insofar as the sampling exercises are concerned, there are two time periods to be considered. First, due to the 15-month period between Perenco's suspension of operations and the beginning of IEMS' first sampling campaign, it is possible that contamination caused by Petroamazonas could have been discovered by the Parties' experts when they sampled the Blocks. Second, it is also possible that the sites that were sampled by the Tribunal's Independent Expert could have been contaminated during the period between the end of the Parties' experts' sampling and the time when Ramboll conducted its sampling activities.\n\n768.\n\nThis is not an academic issue. During the original hearing on the counterclaim, Perenco directed the Tribunal to examples of Petroamazonas having experienced spills after it took over operations in the Blocks.913 In its written submissions on the Independent Expert Report and at the Expert Hearing, Perenco continued to refer to evidence of spills caused by Petroamazonas.914\n\nSee Perenco's Post-Hearing Submission on Counterclaims dated 6 November 2013, fns. 96 and 100, referring to CE-CC-360 regarding Petroamazonas' 2012 spill at Yuralpa Pad E and CE-CC-357 regarding Petroamazonas' 2011 spill at Coca 6.\n\nSee Perenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 12: \"It has also experienced dozens of spills that it only very recently disclosed, and even more spills that it did not disclose. For instance, in May 2012, *El Comercio* reported on the 'Fifth Spill of Hydrocarbons in Ecuador this Year,' noting that there had been 'one spill per month in oil Blocks operated by Petroecuador and Petroamazonas,' including in Block 21. Petroamazonas also reported spills that occurred on 1 March 2015 at undisclosed locations in Payamino; on 16 September 2009, in Payamino; and on 4 January 2014 in Oso 9.\" See also fns. 18 and 20, referring to the following: CE-CC-438 (2011 Spill Report for Coca 6), CE-CC-439 (2011 Investigation Report for Incident in Coca 18-19), CE-CC-440 (2012 Spill Report for Yuralpa Pad E), CE-CC-443 (2016 Investigation Report for Payamino B) and CE-CC-444 (2017 Investigation Report for Oso CPF).\n\n769.\n\nIn the period leading up to the March 2019 Expert Hearing, the Tribunal considered whether a discounting factor of some type, having regard to the two operators' respective tenures in the Blocks, might be appropriate, but it formed no firm view on the matter. In Procedural Order No. 17, issued after the receipt of the Independent Expert Report and in anticipation of the Expert Hearing, the Tribunal invited the Parties to address this issue in their written submissions:\n\n\"On the separate issue raised in the correspondence, namely, the question of sorting out issues of causation for those sites which have been successively worked by Perenco and Petroamazonas, the Tribunal has been considering how to attribute liability in such circumstances. It considers that the issue will to some extent be clarified by the production of documents contemplated in this order. Once a fuller picture of Petroamazonas' possible contribution to any identified contamination is developed, the Tribunal will be in a better position to determine how to proceed. The Tribunal reminds the Parties that the estimation of damages is not a scientific exercise and it might be necessary to employ a general discounting factor in order to arrive at a just and reasonable award. The Parties are encouraged to address this issue in their written submissions.\"915 [Emphasis added.]\n\nProcedural Order No. 17, paragraph 15.\n\n770.\n\nAs a result of the document production exercise, the Parties' focused written submissions, and the testimony and oral submissions at the Expert Hearing, the Tribunal has arrived at a better understanding as to how to deal with the Petroamazonas issue.\n\n771.\n\nStarting with the first period of time, the Tribunal notes that the period of time elapsing between Petroamazonas' assumption of operations and IEMS' first sampling campaign was some 15 months.916 Although it cannot be completely ruled out that some contamination was caused by Petroamazonas prior to IEMS commencing its work (or during the time that it took IEMS and GSI to complete their studies)917, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is unlikely that one or the other of the Parties' experts, particularly Perenco's experts, would have identified any new contamination that they thought occurred *after* Perenco's operatorship and included it as being caused by Perenco.918\n\nIEMS' work commenced in the fourth quarter of 2010 and although IEMS did not identify all of the areas in respect of which it ultimately claimed contamination was found, it did do a substantial amount of initial sampling during the October \u2013 November 2010 period.\n\nSee *e.g.* GSI ER I, paragraph 201, noting that the results of their site inspections showing operating deficiencies which in GSI's opinion pertained to the operating practices of Petroamazonas. See also Saltos WS I, paragraphs 302 and 310 -318.\n\nEcuador argued that the areas evaluated by the Expert were those that IEMS had evaluated since 2010. \"In addition, no recent contamination caused by the current operator has have (sic) been witnessed by any of the actors that have been inspecting the Blocks since 2010 (the Consortium's experts and representatives included) nor were reported by MacDonald during his visit in October/November 2016 or during his 4-month field campaign in the fall of 2017.\" Consolidated Expert Report, p. 10.\n\n772.\n\nWith respect to the second period of time (the period of Petroamazonas' operation between the completion of IEMS'/GSI's work and the commencement of Mr. MacDonald's work), the Tribunal notes that the \"territorial bounds\" of the Independent Expert's sampling exercise were defined principally by IEMS (because GSI viewed its mandate as being mainly one of checking the sites previously sampled by IEMS).919 Insofar as there might have been supervening contamination caused by Petroamazonas, the Tribunal considers that the risk of attributing any such contamination to Perenco has been substantially reduced by the Independent Expert's circumscribed mandate to sample only at those sites which were previously sampled by the Parties' experts (Perenco's mud pits excepted; see below) and by other steps explained below.\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 234: \"In its first report of 20 September 2012, GSI noted that it had been tasked to 'provide an objective evaluation of the work conducted by IEMS and, at the same time, achieve a comprehensive assessment of current environmental conditions for each of the 74 oilfield facilities investigated by IEMS.'\" The Consolidated Expert Report noted at p. 14: \"GSI's primary approach was to either refute the RECs or refine the extent of contamination identified by IEMS (This was not their exclusive effort; GSI also identified additional RECs based on their own field observations and due diligence).\"\n\n773.\n\nHad the Independent Expert been instructed to conduct a *de novo* investigation, he could well have identified contamination caused by Petroamazonas which occurred outside of the sites previously identified by IEMS/GSI. But his restricted mandate reduced the likelihood of that occurring. Since the initial IEMS data were collected within a relatively short period of time after Perenco ceased operations, IEMS' identification of allegedly contaminated sites effectively serves as an \"environmental conditions baseline.\" Any Petroamazonas spills and releases occurring outside of the sites where IEMS and/or GSI sampled were not legally relevant to the Independent Expert's task.\n\n774.\n\nThe only possibility for the Independent Expert's erroneously capturing more recent contamination by Petroamazonas to Perenco would be if Petroamazonas were to have contaminated a site where exceedances were previously identified by either or both of the Parties' experts and the Expert could not differentiate between the new contamination and the old.\n\n775.\n\nA safeguard against that possibility was the Tribunal's direction in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim that:\n\n\"The Parties will be permitted to attend when the expert and his/her team carries out the necessary investigations and the Parties will receive a copy of the expert's report and will be permitted to comment thereon in due course.\"920\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 588. See also paragraph 611(19).\n\n776.\n\nThe Parties accepted this invitation. The Independent Expert noted that he discussed many issues pertaining to the sampling exercise with Parties' representatives during the process of organising his work and that Party representatives were present when the Independent Expert and/or his team conducted their activities in the Blocks.921 An example of the Parties' ability to monitor Ramboll's field work is recounted in the Consolidated Independent Expert Report. The Report noted that when surface soils were to be sampled at the Gacela 02 site, GSI expressed concern about the soils potentially being affected by recent vegetation-control burning activities believed to have been conducted using diesel fuel as an accelerant.922 As a result, Ramboll collected additional samples from the uppermost 10 cm soil interval; Mr. MacDonald reported that the Parties agreed that the results from these samples should satisfy GSI's concern.923\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, p. 3; Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019), pp. 129, 130 and 131.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, fn. 191.\n\n*Id.*\n\n777.\n\nGiven this attention to detail, in the Tribunal's view, it is most unlikely that GSI would have failed to point out recent contamination to Ramboll if it had spotted any. There is no indication that they did so.924 The presence of the Parties' own representatives thus served to further reduce the possibility that any contamination caused by Petroamazonas since the time of IEMS' and GSI's sampling campaigns will be wrongly attributed to Perenco.\n\nRather, Perenco and its technical representatives raised various objections on the basis that Ramboll was sampling in locations for which prior work of IEMS and GSI revealed no exceedances or that were already well delineated or choosing locations not confined to sampling locations identified previously by IEMS or GSI, which Perenco alleged to be outside the scope of the Expert's mandate (see the correspondence of 13 September 2017 and 14 November 2017). Perenco also objected to Ecuador's attempt to have Ramboll consider locations where there was \"visual evidence\" of potential contamination (see its letter of 14 November 2017). The Tribunal notes Ramboll's letter of 28 December 2017 in response to Perenco's letter of 14 November 2017, where the Expert noted that there had been consistent dialogue with the Parties throughout the scoping and implementation process related to field activities and that the Parties' technical representatives were present when the locations of the monitoring wells and other testing locations were field-marked in August, as well as throughout the entire sampling programme, including during the groundwater monitoring well installations, which commenced in mid-September 2017.\n\n778.\n\nNevertheless, because an undetected layering of spills cannot be ruled out, the Tribunal took a further step in agreeing with Perenco that Petroamazonas' spill reports and related documents should be produced to Perenco. This would enable the Parties to cross-check the sites identified in those documents against the sites identified by the Independent Expert to see whether any of the contamination he had identified could have been caused by Petroamazonas.\n\n779.\n\nThe Tribunal found Perenco's initial request for the production of documents to be overly broad in that it asked the Tribunal to:\n\n\"\u2026direct Ecuador to immediately produce all relevant documentation pertaining to the environmental condition of the Blocks post-July 2009. Based on information in the record and publicly available information, that documentation should include annual environmental reports, bi-annual environmental audits, internal monitoring reports, oil spill reporting records, work orders issued by Petroamazonas to contractors assessing, mitigating, managing, or remediating potential environmental impacts in the Blocks, and any transactional documents with new operators describing the environmental conditions in the Blocks post-July 2009.\"925\n\nProcedural Order No. 17, paragraph 2.\n\n780.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that while this request was properly motivated and made timeously, it should be more narrowly focused on whether Petroamazonas caused any spills *at the particular sites identified by the Independent Expert as requiring remediation*. It was unnecessary to require production of documents relating to any sites which were excluded from his investigation926 or where the Independent Expert did not find contamination because the rest of the Blocks fell outside of his mandate. Procedural Order No. 17 therefore directed that:\n\n\"\u2026 as contemplated in Ecuador's offer quoted above at paragraph 11 [of Procedural Order No. 17], only documents relating to those sites are relevant for the purpose of the estimation of damages. The Tribunal believes that Perenco is entitled to have access to such documents and it would not be unduly burdensome for Ecuador to produce them on a rolling basis.\"927\n\nSee the Consolidated Expert Report, section 4.2, Site Screening, which lists in Table 4.1, Sites Omitted from Ramboll's Investigation, in Table 4.2, Sites Where Soils Not Further Investigated, and in Table 4.3, Sites Where Mud Pits Not Further Investigated, and section 4.2.4, which listed groundwater excluded from further consideration.\n\nProcedural Order No. 17, paragraph 14.\n\n781.\n\nAfter the order was issued, starting on 29 January 2019, Ecuador began to produce responsive documents, namely, annual environmental reports of Blocks 7 and 21 as well as spill and clean-up reports for sites identified by the Tribunal's Expert as requiring remediation.928 Ecuador informed the Tribunal that within two weeks of the order, it had provided some 120 documents relating to environmental incidents during Petroamazonas' operatorship of the two Blocks.929 By letter dated 7 February 2019, Ecuador stated that it produced 214 responsive documents to Perenco (and that this had been acknowledged by Perenco on 5 February 2019930)931; and on 12 February 2019, Ecuador provided additional documents to Perenco.932 Ecuador's comments in the Consolidated Independent Expert Report note that it produced some 2500 responsive documents to Perenco.933\n\nSee Ecuador's letter of 29 January 2019, p. 1.\n\nSee Ecuador's letter of 31 January 2019, p. 1. \"Ecuador informs the Tribunal that it produced additional documents (including the Petroamazonas' Resolution No. 099-PAM-EP-CON-2017 mentioned by Perenco in its 25 January 2019 letter) today. A reasonable search for additional potentially responsive documents is still ongoing Ecuador will produce any additional responsive documents (if any) without delay.\"\n\nSee Perenco's letter of 5 February 2019: \"Unfortunately, although on January 29 and 31, 2019 Ecuador produced 214 documents, this production is neither complete nor satisfactory. Ecuador has produced annual environmental reports for Blocks 7 and 21, as well as some spill and clean-up records of incidents that occurred since 2009. However, it has not produced: (i) any biannual reports for Blocks 7 and 21, (ii) reports of other environmental incidents that occurred post-July 2009 at the sites Mr. MacDonald has identified for remediation, or (iii) work orders issued by Petroamazonas to contractors assessing, mitigating, managing or remediating potential environmental impacts at relevant sites, and that would contain information on the remediation costs that Petroamazonas has actually incurred to address environmental impacts at relevant sites. For the reasons Perenco has already explained, and the Tribunal acknowledged in Procedural Order No. 17, this information is critical to ensure that Perenco is not being held liable for the acts of its successor \u2013 especially when that successor is Ecuador, the counterclaimant here. Ecuador's belated and incomplete production is highly prejudicial to Perenco and grossly unfair. Ecuador must forthwith make a more complete production.\"\n\nEcuador's letter of 7 February 2019, p. 1, responded to Perenco's complaints: \"In spite of acknowledging having already received 214 responsive documents from Ecuador on very short notice, Perenco qualifies Ecuador's 'production [as being] neither complete nor satisfactory' in a misguided effort to discourage the Tribunal from allowing the introduction of records of workovers performed by Perenco. Yet, Ecuador has complied (and continues to undertake its best reasonable efforts to comply) with PO 17.\" Ecuador added: \"Ecuador commenced disclosing responsive documents to Perenco, on a rolling basis, on 29 January 2019 (i.e., only 14 days after PO 17) by producing a first back of some 100 post-July 2009 spill clean-up reports. Subsequently, on 31 January 2019 Ecuador disclosed over 100 documents (including annual environmental audits for Block 7 and 21 since 2010). In sum, Ecuador has produced over 200 documents within two weeks from the Tribunal's order.\" Finally, Ecuador responded to Perenco's complaint that it was not providing reports for relevant sites: \"Ecuador can confirm that there are no records of any spills during Petroamazonas' operations at 24 sites. There are, therefore, no additional spill reports to be disclosed.\" Finally, Ecuador indicated that Petroamazonas had recently advised that it identified additional responsive documents including the biennial audits conducted at Blocks seven and 21 which Ecuador would promptly disclose as soon as they were retrieved.\n\nSee Ecuador's letter of 12 February 2019, which stated: \"Ecuador hereby informs the Tribunal that it has produced additional documents to Perenco today.\"\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, p. 250.\n\n782.\n\nAlthough Perenco complained about the extent of Ecuador's compliance with the Tribunal's order934, it did not place much emphasis on such complaints.935 Both Parties have been represented in this arbitration by capable counsel and the Tribunal is loath to find that Ecuador did not produce the relevant Petroamazonas documents pertaining to spill incidents in the areas of concern to the Expert. It proceeds on the basis that Ecuador duly complied with the terms of Procedural Order No. 17.\n\nSee Perenco's letter of 5 February 2019 quoted above. In addition, Perenco's 22 February 2019 submission stated at paragraph 12: \"Ecuador's eleventh-hour document production leaves a picture that is far too incomplete to adequately depict ten-years' worth of [Petroamazonas'] operations' environmental impacts.\"\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slides 81 and 84 regarding its allegation that Ecuador failed to disclose certain environmental incidents and Ecuador's representation that Lobo 4 had not been operated after 2009.\n\n783.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken further note of the fact that at the Expert Hearing, Perenco did not direct the Independent Expert to many of the Petroamazonas spill reports.936 This suggests that the documentary evidence produced to Perenco was not as supportive of its contention that a substantial amount of the contamination identified by Mr. MacDonald should be attributed to Petroamazonas' activities as Perenco had hoped.937\n\nThe main example being a Petroamazonas spill at Coca 6. See Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 173-175, Mr. Friedman's cross-examination of Mr. MacDonald with respect to the spill at Coca 6.\n\nAlthough counsel argued in favour of a discounting factor with respect to soil and groundwater remediation costs based on the relative length of time of Petroamazonas and Perenco in the operation of the Blocks, it pointed to little evidence drawn from the spill reports and other documents produced to it to prove that any of the contamination that had been estimated by Mr. MacDonald was attributable to Petroamazonas. Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 173-176, 222-223; Tr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 460.\n\n784.\n\nThere seems to be a good reason for this: having regard to the documentary evidence produced by Ecuador, it appears that 35 spills and releases were reported to have occurred in the relevant areas since July 2009.938 They were mainly small quantity spills or releases that were remediated or occurred within secondary containment. More important for the Tribunal's determination is that *26 of the 35 spills evidently occurred away from areas identified by Mr. MacDonald as contaminated or at sites where his conceptual remediation plan addresses only mud pits that were constructed and used by Perenco*. Further, five of the spills occurred at sites where the remediation plan addresses elevated metal concentrations (*e.g*., barium). Moreover, there is no mention in the Independent Expert Report of any recent spills witnessed at sites where Ramboll tested. This led Ecuador to assert that while the Expert observed crude oil in swampy areas at some sites (*e.g*., Coca 2 and Payamino 2/8), he did not observe conditions that would indicate recent releases.939\n\nE-460.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, p. 10, point 7: \"The areas evaluated by MacDonald were those that IEMS had evaluated since 2010. In addition, no recent contamination caused by the current operator has have been [*sic*] witnessed by any of the actors that have been inspecting the Blocks since 2010 (the Consortium's experts and representatives included) nor were reported by MacDonald during his visit in October/November 2016 or during his 4-month field campaign in the fall of 2017.\"\n\n785.\n\nIn sum, in relation to what might be called the 'Petroamazonas temporal issue', given the totality of the circumstances (including the Independent Expert's restricted mandate, his and his team's consultations with the Parties' experts and counsel throughout his sampling activities, and the spill reports and other documents produced by Ecuador), the Tribunal has concluded that the use of a generally applicable discounting factor based *exclusively* upon a split between the length of time that Perenco and Petroamazonas' operated in the Blocks would, by itself, be too crude a method of allocating responsibility and insufficiently connected to the record evidence. The Tribunal concluded that a closer look at the sites where contamination was found was required before using any discounting factor based on, for example, the respective length of the two operators' tenures.\n\n*(c) Contamination caused by prior operators*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n786.\n\nThe second temporal issue, namely, the possibility of Perenco being wrongly held accountable for contamination caused by prior operators is, in the Tribunal's view, a much more significant and difficult issue.\n\n787.\n\nResolving this issue is complicated by the fact that Perenco's documentary evidence of its own evaluation of the Blocks' condition in 2002 was non-existent. Mr. Wilfrido Saltos testified that an evaluation of the Blocks was performed when Perenco acquired its interests, but when requested, Perenco was unable to produce any written audit of the Blocks prepared by or for it in order to ascertain their condition at the time of acquisition.940 The most it could show was that it obtained a representation and warranty from the seller, Kerr-McGee, that the latter had complied with all applicable Ecuadorian laws relating to the environment, with the exception of certain matters listed in two schedules to the contracts.941 One of the schedules, Schedule 3.9(a), was admitted into the record earlier in this proceeding.942\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraphs 386-388.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 392-393.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 394.\n\n788.\n\nThe Tribunal considered Schedule 3.9(a) to be of some assistance to ascertaining the state of the Blocks' environmental condition in 2002. It noted:\n\n\"For present purposes, while the Tribunal considers that Schedule 3.9(a) provides a helpful contemporaneous assessment of the Blocks, it cannot be considered to be a definitive and exhaustive analysis of their environmental condition. There might have been contamination of which Kerr-McGee was unaware or which it might have failed to disclose. There is no indication that Perenco challenged Kerr-McGee's list of noncompliant issues by informing it of contamination or other regulatory problems which had not been disclosed to it under Schedule 3.9(a) nor is there any evidence of Perenco's having ever complained to Kerr McGee that it had made anything other than an accurate disclosure. Schedule 3.9 (a) thus provides a starting point for distinguishing between any contamination that might have occurred prior to Perenco's acquisition of its interests and any contamination which occurred thereafter.\"943 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 398.\n\n789.\n\nSchedule 3.9 (a) was thus one helpful piece of evidence, a starting point, but hardly dispositive of the question of the Blocks' environmental condition.\n\n790.\n\nThe other schedule, Schedule 3.9(b), which listed all wells in the Contract Area and a description of their status, was not included in Perenco's redacted version of the Purchase and Sale Agreement produced earlier in the counterclaim proceeding. The Tribunal considered that this should be produced in the next phase of this proceeding because it might shed additional light on the condition of the Blocks in 2002.944 Schedule 3.9(b) was duly produced by Perenco, but it only lists the status of each well in the Blocks at the time of acquisition and provides no additional insight into their environmental condition.945\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 399.\n\nCE-CC-432, produced under cover of Perenco's letter dated 25 January 2019. The schedule listed some 50 producing wells, 10 shut-in wells, three P & A wells (\"plugged and abandoned\"), one TA well (\"temporarily abandoned\") and three water disposal wells in Block 7; and two plugged and abandoned wells, seven temporarily abandoned wells, and one testing well in Block 21.\n\n791.\n\nThe Tribunal also considered that if the Parties were unable to settle this part of the case on the basis of the Interim Decision on Counterclaim's findings and the Tribunal had to proceed to this phase of the proceeding, it would be helpful to examine DINAPA-CSA-1602001-20001697 of September 2001, if a copy of that letter could be located, because it set out the authority's view of what needed to be done at the time in order to bring the Operator into compliance with its legal obligations.946 This was duly submitted by Ecuador as E-445. Regrettably, it did not advance matters. A comparison of DINAPA's 4 September 2001 inspection letter to Schedule 3.9(a) shows that the Schedule essentially reproduces it.\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 397.\n\n792.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls its prior discussion of the evidence as to the environmental conditions of the Blocks at the time of Perenco's acquisition of its interests in the Production Sharing Contracts:\n\n\"In both the Parties' written pleadings and in their experts' reports, there was considerable debate over whether certain instances of contamination were attributable to the actions of Perenco or to other parties who carried on operations in what became Blocks 7 and 21 before Perenco arrived on the scene. In view of the Tribunal's finding that under the fault-based regime Perenco can avoid liability if it can demonstrate that a particular instance of contamination resulted from the acts of another person, this necessarily requires the Tribunal to consider the environmental conditions of the two Blocks at the time that Perenco acquired its interests from Kerr-McGee.\"947\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 380.\n\n793.\n\nThe Interim Decision on Counterclaim reviewed evidence of prior contamination which was submitted by Perenco.948 Perenco returned to some of this evidence during its closing submissions in the latest phase of this proceeding.949 It also made the important point that Ecuadorian environmental law has become more rigorous over time.950\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraphs 405 and footnotes 926, 927 and 934.\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slides 61-67.\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 513:17-514:3: \"You are being confronted with old legacy liabilities, for the most part, things that happened a long time ago under a different regulatory regime. They might not have even been violations of the environmental regulations at the time, but, nevertheless, they occurred on the State's watch or at a time when operations were for the State's benefit, and Perenco had no role in it. Perenco was not even in the picture.\"\n\n794.\n\nDrilling in the Coca-Payamino unified field dates back to 1971, with successive operators CEPE and BP, *Petroproducci\u00f3n*, Oryx, then *Petroproducci\u00f3n* again, and then Kerr-McGee, all preceding Perenco's entry into that field some 30 years after CEPE and BP first conducted exploratory drilling.951\n\nGSI prepared a Table in Appendix B.4 to its first expert report which listed on a site by site basis, the drilling of certain wells (Payamino 02-08, Mono CPF/Mono 1-5/1W, Payamino 1, Gacela 01-08, Coca 18-19, Coca 01, Coca 04, Coca 06, Coca 08, Coca CPF, Gacela 02, Jaguar 02, Jaguar 07-08, Mono Sur / Mono 6-9, 11, Payamino 04, and Yuralpa Pad A) by Perenco's predecessors and the effects of such drilling.\n\n795.\n\nIn Block 7, CEPE and BP, Kerr-McGee and *Petroproducci\u00f3n*, then Kerr-McGee, all operated prior to Perenco. Unsurprisingly, more wells were drilled by the preceding operators in the Coca-Payamino unified field and Block 7 (Oso excepted) than by Perenco itself.952\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 4. GSI ER I, paragraph 160: \"Of the 95 wells completed in the CPUF and Block 7 areas by 2009, 68 (71%) were drilled prior to 2002. Consequently, soil impacts related to drilling activities at those pre-2002 sites would be associated with prior operators, not the Consortium. Indeed, available information indicates that some wells drilled prior to 1990 were completed without use of mud/cuttings pits, resulting in discharge of excess drilling mud and cuttings to the surrounding area.\"\n\n796.\n\nIn Block 21, which does not have as long a history as Block 7953 (Perenco itself characterised Block 21 as a \"greenfield development project\" because there was \"no oil producing infrastructure\"954), Kerr-McGee preceded Perenco.955 Indeed, of the 77 wells listed in Schedule 3.9(b) to the Kerr-McGee Purchase and Sale Agreement, only nine were located in Block 21 and none of them were operating at the time of acquisition.956 Insofar as the wells at the Yuralpa field in Block 21 are concerned, Perenco drilled the lion's share of those wells957 until Petroamazonas began operations.958\n\nIt appears that Yuralpa 1 was drilled in 1972 by Texaco. See GSI ER I Appendix B.4. The next wells to be drilled were Yuralpa Centro 1 (October 1997), Dayuno 1 (September-October 1987), Sumino (an injection well) (May 1998), Yuralpa Centro 2 (April 1999), Nemoca (December 1999), and Waponi and Ocatoe (both in August 2000).\n\nIn its Revised Memorial dated 5 August 2011, Perenco asserted at paragraph 42: \"Block 21 is a 155,000 hectare plot several hundred kilometers east of Quito. LC WS \u00b6 4. At the time Perenco acquired its interest in Ecuador, Block 21 was literally a greenfield development project: there was no oil producing infrastructure.\"\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 3.\n\nCE-CC-432. The wells are Yuralpa-1, Dayuno-1, Yuralpa C-1, Chonta-1, Sumino-1, Yuralpa C-2, Nemoca-1, Waponi-1, and Ocatoe-1. The first two were 'plugged and abandoned' and all of the rest were 'temporarily abandoned'.\n\nSee GSI ER I Appendix B.4, pp. 4-5.\n\nPerenco noted, at paragraphs 45-47 of its Revised Memorial, dated 5 August 2011, that: Block 21 was essentially a \"greenfield development project\" because there was no there was \"no oil producing infrastructure.\" Perenco stated: \"by the end of the first quarter of 2004, the Consortium had brought production from zero to close to 22,000 barrels a day.\" However, due to a \"technical setback [which] caused a drop in the production of Block 21's most productive wells which, at the time, had been producing approximately 12,000 barrels per day\u2026 Perenco was forced to drill additional wells that were not originally contemplated and to commit additional capital to restore production.\" \"Consequently, by the end of the first quarter of 2006 \u2013 when Ecuador enacted Law 42 \u2013 the Consortium had invested $197 million in Block 21\u2026 It had drilled over 25 production wells, as opposed to the 12 originally contemplated, and was producing nearly 16,000 barrels per day.\"\n\n797.\n\nIt appears that some 84 spills and releases were reported to have occurred prior to September 2002, of which four were not specifically tied to a site but only to Block 7 or an oilfield (*e.g*., Coca, Mono-Jaguar, Payamino).959 GSI also used a somewhat lower number; it included with its first expert report in 2012 as Appendix B.3, which identified 55 \"pre-Perenco\" spills and releases.960 A brief description of the nature and quality of the release and any recovered product was included in the summary table. At 11 of these sites, the reported releases were more than 20 barrels, and some of these releases were reportedly significant (*i.e*., 150 barrels at Coca 8 and 110 barrels at Gacela 6). However, GSI did not provide details on, among other things, where the releases took place within a given site, what media was affected (*e.g*., soil, surface water), how the affected media were addressed (if at all), or provide the supporting documents used by it in order to create its summary table.\n\nSee Appendix B of GSI ER I and the 1998 Grizzle Report. See also summary table from Perenco Ecuador to DINAPA, Technical Report \u2013 Environmental Characterization of Platform Payamino 2-8 (\"Walsh Report\"), and Records of Petroamazonas' post-July 2009 spills (provided by Ecuador as Exhibit E-460 submitted with its comments on the Report by the Tribunal's Expert on February 22, 2019).\n\nGSI ER I, Appendix B.3.\n\n798.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal accepts the thrust of Perenco's position that there had to be pre-existing contamination because there is evidence to support the findings that: (i) the Ecuadorian legal framework governing the environmental aspects of oilfield operations was less rigorous than RAOHE and TULAS (the former promulgated in 1995 and then amended in 2001 and the latter promulgated in 2003961); and (ii) at least some operators' practices were conducted to that less rigorous standard in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, pp. iii-iv.\n\n799.\n\nFor example, an internal environmental assessment report on the Coca-Payamino field prepared for Oryx in 1994 by Patrick Grizzle and Nancy Sahr (when Oryx took over operations in that field), was troubling. In addition to identifying various practices which needed improvement, the report noted:\n\n\"There is presently no reporting or written procedures within *PetroProducci\u00f3n* [sic] for environmental pollution or spill incident reporting. An incident reporting system should be put in place as soon as possible.\"962 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 383, quoting Exhibit E-261, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Coca-Payamino Field dated May 1994, p. 6.\n\n800.\n\nThe 1994 report unfortunately contained no results of sampling and analysis. The authors thought from a visual inspection that the contamination was \"minimal\", but added that: \"as this study did not include sampling and analysis, no confirmation of contamination levels can be made.\"963 In the Tribunal's view, it is more likely than not that *Petroproducci\u00f3n* and other operators at the time caused damage, but there is little in the way of hard information as to the extent of the contamination that might have resulted from the laxity in environmental practices at that time. As the Tribunal previously noted when it discussed the issue in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, visual inspections are important, but in and of themselves are not sufficient to identify and determine the extent of contamination.964\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 382, quoting Exhibit E-261, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Coca-Payamino Field dated May 1994, p. 4.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 409: \"\u2026The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that the fact that rapid growth of vegetation might obscure a visual inspection of contaminants, does not mean that they disappear for remediation purposes. Hence, while as GSI emphasised, visual inspections are an important part of conducting a thorough assessment, they are hardly adequate to the task of ascertaining the extent of contamination and the Tribunal is not content to rely upon an expert's visual evaluation.\" Perenco itself pointed this out, at paragraph 266 of its Rejoinder on Counterclaims, when commenting on the various audits performed when Oryx was the operator, specifically in relation to the Jungal swamp/Payamino 2-8 contamination: \"Comments in later audits that the area affected by a subsequent 1991 spill by Petroproducci\u00f3n 'has been revegetated and is doing well' would not establish that this was due to remediation, whether of the 1991 spill or the 1987 incident. Today, the *Jungal* swamp is still heavily vegetated, appears to be doing well to the naked eye, and shows no obvious signs of contamination, yet both IEMS and GSI have confirmed TPH and barium exceedances in that location.\" There is also evidence of crude oil both on the slope leading to the swamp and within the swamp itself.\n\n801.\n\nThere is some evidence that some of the spills identified in 1994 at least were remediated. The March 1996 Internal Environmental Audit of Oryx Ecuador Operations, also performed by Mr. Grizzle and Ms. Sahr, which followed up on a 1995 audit, noted that:\n\n\"Several environmental issues were noted during the audit. Several of these were noted in the 1995 Audit and some have been corrected or partially corrected.\"965 [Emphasis added.]\n\nE-262, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Coca-Payamino Field, dated May 1994, p. 4. The 1998 report noted further improvement: \"Several general environmental issues were noted during the audit. Several of these were noted in the previous audits and most have been corrected or partially corrected. In general, better environmental practices were noted in the 1998 as compared with the 1997 audit.\" E-264, Environmental Assessment of Oryx Ecuador Energy Company, Coca-Payamino Field dated 22-23 June 1998, p. 1.\n\n802.\n\nThe 1998 Grizzle report, commissioned at a time when Oryx was negotiating to take over the operation of the Coca-Payamino field, followed the same format and general content of the previous years' reports. The report essentially provided a photographic snapshot of conditions at 27 sites. It generally shows that, other than a single spill at Coca 6, historical events can be described as small quantity spills or releases that seemed to result from poor operation and maintenance practices (*e.g*., leaky valves and flanges, damaged secondary containment systems, overflowing oil/water separators, overfilling of diesel tanks). The most significant and largest quantity of spills were observed within the CPFs (Coca CPF and Payamino CPF) and not the platforms.966 In the end, the 1998 Grizzle report did not seek to identify the specific releases, to estimate quantities, or to ascertain when the releases occurred.\n\nThe Tribunal itself noted in its Interim Decision on Counterclaim, at paragraph 405, that the record evidence indicated \"some problems with the Coca-Payamino Field and the Oso 1 platform\" which predated Perenco's operatorship.\n\n803.\n\nThe Interim Decision on Counterclaim noted that:\n\n\"\u2026 when Oryx was negotiating to resume the operatorship of the Coca-Payamino Field (it evidently had been operated by *Petroproducci\u00f3n* for some eighteen months), a Mr. Patrick Grizzle (who appears to have been an Oryx employee) conducted an inspection from 12 to 14 January 1998. Mr. Grizzle's view was that environmental conditions had deteriorated in the period during which the field was being operated by *Petroproducci\u00f3n* and he was critical of its operatorship. Oryx had operated the field from 1995 to 1997 and Mr. Grizzle recorded what he viewed as backsliding from many of Oryx's better practices. He appears to have reached this conclusion entirely on visual inspections (many photographs are attached to the report). Once again, according to the report, no sampling of soils, surface water or groundwater were taken.\"967 [Emphasis added.]\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 385 [footnote references omitted].\n\n804.\n\nIt is not in dispute between the Parties that in the period leading up to Perenco's suspension of operations in July 2009, most of the production wells in the Block 7 and the Coca-Payamino field (excluding Oso) were drilled before Perenco arrived in Ecuador. In its Closing Presentation, Perenco listed 57 wells that pre-dated its operatorship of Block 21. (In contrast, it listed 15 wells for which it appeared to take responsibility in that Block.968)\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 4.\n\n805.\n\nGiven the Grizzle-Sahr reports, in particular, the comments on *Petroproducci\u00f3n* 's backsliding (quoted in paragraph 385 of the Interim Decision on Counterclaim just noted) and various other pieces of evidence pertaining to wells that were drilled before Perenco's operatorship, the Tribunal is reluctant to rely upon the Purchase and Sale Agreement's schedules as constituting an exhaustive and definitive statement of the Blocks' environmental condition. The Tribunal cannot but note however that Perenco should have better inspected and documented the conditions of the Blocks before signing the SPA and its schedules. It is due to its neglect that the schedules do not provide an exhaustive and definitive statement of the Blocks' condition in 2002.\n\n806.\n\nThe 1998 Grizzle-Sahr report neatly illustrates the challenge facing the Tribunal in differentiating between contamination in the Blocks which is plainly legally irrelevant and that which *might* be legally relevant to the present exercise. The 1998 report observed that there had been a release at Coca 6. But that release occurred in an area that is some distance away from the area at Coca 6 that is included in Mr. MacDonald's conceptual remedial plan and hence no question of Perenco's liability arises.969 However, the Grizzle-Sahr report also identified three sites where reported releases might have contributed to contamination in areas which the Independent Expert identified as warranting remediation. Given the annual inspections and recommendation made therein, and Grizzle and Sahr's noting that some progress had been made in dealing with matters identified in previous reports, it is possible that Kerr-McGee took steps to remediate these incidents prior to its selling its interests in the Blocks to Perenco, but there is insufficient evidence on the record for the Tribunal to be satisfied on this point. The Tribunal therefore proceeds on the basis that some of the contamination at the following three sites predated Perenco's operatorship:\n\n\u2013 Coca 2/CPF - Oil releases from the API separator that discharged to the swampy area to the southeast of the facility.\n\n\u2013 Payamino 1/CPF - The presence of historical facility pits with several thousand barrels of crude to the west of the CPF, which could have potentially overflown to the north, towards the catchment area and the swampy area to the north/northwest of the facility.\n\n\u2013 Payamino 23 \u2013 Spills were observed behind the power oil system and at the north entrance and an open reserve pit was still in place to the south of the power oil facility.970\n\nCE-CC-21; Appendix K of GSI ER I; Ecuador's Closing Submissions, p. 2.\n\nIn respect of the first two of these sites, the Tribunal considers that the substantial majority of the contamination found by the Expert was caused by Perenco's predecessors.\n\n807.\n\nThis shows the potential for the layering of contamination by different operators. This situation militates in favour of allocating responsibility based on the length of tenure or based on some other weighting factor.\n\n808.\n\nIn the end, the Tribunal is satisfied that the contemporaneous documentary evidence indicates that there was contamination caused by operators in the Blocks in the decades preceding the period of Perenco's operatorship. The visual inspections recorded in the various reports just quoted identified a variety of different shortcomings and in some instances Grizzle and Sahr gave \"poor housekeeping\" marks for various wells.971 It is sufficient for the Tribunal to know that there were extensive drilling operations in the Coca-Payamino field and other parts of Block 7 and a few wells were drilled in Block 21 before Perenco arrived and that there is contemporaneous documentary evidence showing that at that time there was a relative laxity when it came to conducting drilling operations and other oilfield activities in an environmentally-protective manner.\n\nFollowing a May 1994 audit, Grizzle and Sahr concluded that the following sites suffered from poor housekeeping which \"infers inferior operating procedures reflected by obvious debris, minimal or no maintenance of equipment and buildings, numerous operational spills, and inadequate vegetation and erosion control\" (p. 12) (only those sites delineated by Mr. MacDonald are listed here): Payamino 4, Payamino 10, Payamino 13, Payamino 15, Payamino 16, Payamino and Coca CPF (but the report says that the level of contamination was minor, see p. 44), and Coca 8. See E-261.  \nFollowing a 11-14 March 1996 inspection, Grizzle and Sahr noted that the poor housekeeping at Payamino 10 had been corrected (p. 9) whereas this still persisted at Payamino 16 (p. 11). Their report also noted that Jaguar 7's sewage system was \"extremely poor\" and there were poor storage practices (p. 6). More generally, the report considered that the practice of discharging of sewage into a stream had to be reconsidered, not just for Mono 3, but as a whole, in order to protect the health of people on location and those living along the streams (p. 6). See E-262.  \nThe copy of Grizzle and Sahr's 6-9 June 1997 report provided to the Tribunal appears to have been truncated and does not discuss specific sites. See E-263.  \nAfter the 22-23 June 1998 internal environmental audit, Grizzle and Sahr did not refer to housekeeping conditions, but instead noted the various issues and steps required with respect to various sites. Generally, the following sites were noted as requiring or still requiring remediation (mostly affected soil): Lobo 1 facility, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 3, Jaguar 7, Mono 1, Mono 5, Gacela 1/8, Gacela 2, Gacela 4, Gacela 5, Gacela CPF (once again, only those sites delineated by Mr. MacDonald have been set out here).\n\n809.\n\nPerenco has also directed the Tribunal to other evidence of spills prior to its assumption of the operatorship of the two Blocks. The Tribunal accepts Perenco's contention that certain contaminants, in particular, barium (with or without other metals (*i.e.* cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel and/or vanadium)), should be taken to be associated with the installation of production wells. Given the documentary evidence showing substantial drilling of such wells prior to 2002, it follows that barium exceedances at those sites have been shown by Perenco, on a preponderance of evidence, to have resulted from the actions of its predecessors. Given the location of those wells, together with the mud pits constructed and used by Perenco's predecessors, and the Tribunal has been able to exclude liability, either wholly or partially, for different parts of the various sites investigated.\n\n810.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises that in attempting to \"unscramble the contamination egg\", it is dealing with knowns and unknowns.972 Notwithstanding the work conducted by the Parties' experts and supplemented by the Tribunal's Independent Expert, this exercise is not one of scientific certainty. But, as noted above at paragraph 69, the estimation of damages is not a science and a court or tribunal must work with the evidence before it.\n\nAs the Expert's Direct Presentation made clear, at Slide 18, data gaps can exist even after multiple sampling events and therefore inferences are typically applied to complement analytical results.\n\n811.\n\nTo be clear: before using a time-based weighting system in respect to a particular site, areas within the site that could be clearly designated as \"non-Perenco\" or \"Perenco\" were segregated and placed in the corresponding \"bucket\" of responsibility. In addition, where other criteria could be used, these were applied in lieu of the time-weighted approach. But sometimes it has been necessary to allocate responsibility between successive operators. So far as prior operators are concerned, the time of first well drilling at a specific site is used as the starting point and July 2009, when Perenco ceased operations in the Blocks, is used as the end date (with the exception of sites where the 'Petroamazonas temporal issue' applies).973 This tends to bias in favour of Perenco, and therefore is a conservative estimate of its responsibility, because it does not consider the possibility of later contaminant release dates and the fact that some fields were drilled but not heavily exploited until Perenco arrived (*i.e*., Oso and Yuralpa).974 As for any allocation as between Perenco and Petroamazonas, to the limited extent that it is used (for the reasons previously given), the time-weighted system uses July 2019 as the end date. This is relevant only for a few sites for groundwater (Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF) and therefore assumes much less importance than the system used for Perenco and prior operators.\n\nSee paragraph 785 above.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, pp. 24-25: \"The first petroleum exploration activities within Block 7 and the CPUF reportedly occurred in the early 1970s, when Texaco drilled exploratory oil wells at the Coca 1, C\u00f3ndor 1, and Zorro 1 platforms. British Petroleum (BP) also constructed an exploratory well at Oso 1 in 1970. Oil extraction activities do not appear to have occurred until approximately December 1985 when BP began developing the area under a service contract\u2026\" As for Block 21, \"Texaco began oil exploration activities in Block 21 during the early 1970s at the Yuralpa 1 platform. Further activities were not conducted within the Block until March 1995, when Oryx conducted further exploratory environmental impact and seismic studies. When Perenco began operating at Block 21 in 2002, it contained a small number of wells (approximately nine) and Central Processing Facilities (CPFs). Upon the July 2009 takeover of the operations, operations within Block 21 had increased substantially.\"\n\n**3. Did the Independent Expert act within his mandate?**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n812.\n\nTurning to the second set of issues, virtually all of them are bound up with the exercise of technical judgement and expertise. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the following questions pertaining to the Independent Expert's mandate should be addressed.\n\n813.\n\nSpecifically, did the Independent Expert:\n\nAdhere to the Tribunal's restrictions on site sampling?\n\nFollow the Tribunal's instructions on establishing the land-use criteria?\n\nExceed his mandate with respect to mud pits by resolving to apply RAOHE Table 7(a) to all mud pits?\n\nExceed his mandate with respect to groundwater monitoring by resolving to apply TULAS to groundwater samples taken from wells installed in sites where the clay content exceeded 25%?\n\nAdhere to the Tribunal's instruction that when estimating costs of any remediation for which Perenco is liable, the Expert shall be guided by Ecuadorian costs?975\n\nSuch issues as the interpretation of chromatograms, calculation of background values and 'order of magnitude' issues are considered to fall within his sphere of expertise and competence.\n\n*(a) The Independent Expert's sampling mandate*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n814.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Mr. MacDonald was instructed to review the work performed by the Parties' experts and to sample at those sites where either or both of the Parties' experts had found evidence of contamination. The Tribunal reasoned that:\n\n\"590. \u2026 IEMS and GSI had ample opportunity to take samples in whatever parts of the Blocks either considered necessary. The Tribunal's expert will therefore confine his/her work to the specific sites at which soil samples were taken and groundwater sampling wells were drilled. Although, due to the differences between IEMS and GSI's sampling practices, it will be necessary for the expert to re-sample at those sites where contamination was detected by one or the other party's experts and to delineate the extent of any such contamination, the Tribunal's expert will not sample other sites that the Parties' experts did not sample.976\n\n592. \u2026 the Tribunal wishes to make clear that this course of action is not intended to provide any opportunity for the Parties to provide new evidence (except that called for by the Tribunal in aid of its expert). They have had ample opportunity to present their cases. The purpose of the next phase is for the Tribunal's expert to validate one approach or the other in respect of the remaining technical issues.\"977\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 590.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 592.\n\n815.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal observed:\n\n\"596. It need hardly be said that every attempt must be made to base the determination of damages owed on the situation existing at the time of the Consortium's departure in July 2009.\"978\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 596.\n\n816.\n\nMr. MacDonald was thus instructed not to perform a *de novo* study of the environmental condition of the two Blocks. The Tribunal recognised that this instruction meant that there would almost certainly be contamination in the two Blocks which was not captured either by the Parties' experts or by the Tribunal's Independent Expert:\n\n\"595. The Tribunal is mindful that it is almost certain that the sampling performed by both experts did not adequately capture all of the contamination. Indeed, notwithstanding its initial declaration that its intention was to \"achieve a comprehensive assessment of current environmental conditions for each of the 74 oilfield facilities investigated by IEMS in the CPUF, Block 7, and Block 21 area\", this is not what GSI did. As Ecuador pointed out, GSI accepted that it confined its investigation to seeking to invalidate RECs identified by IEMS. Mr. Connor further confirmed that GSI did not attempt to comprehensively estimate the amount of contamination in the Blocks, separately from its review of IEMS' work, and acknowledged that both experts could have missed instances of contamination. Be this as it may, the present exercise is concerned with an accurate and impartial analysis of the work that was done by the experts \u2013 who had ample opportunity to examine the Blocks. Their work must now be evaluated by the expert in accordance with the Tribunal's findings.\"979 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Id.*\n\n817.\n\nTwo other points warrant mention. First, as noted above, Mr. MacDonald was instructed not to consider the allocation of responsibility to Perenco for its share of the contamination which he determined to exist in the relevant sites. Secondly, he was also instructed to perform his work without regard to the determinations made by the *Burlington* tribunal.980\n\nExpert's Direct Presentation, Slide 3.\n\n*(b) Did the Expert exceed his mandate in conducting sampling at sites that were not sampled by either of the Parties' experts?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n818.\n\nPerenco complained that certain sites which the Expert decided to sample had not been found to be contaminated by either of the Parties' experts. The Expert moreover assumed that certain mud pits contained exceedances without his having sampled them.981 Perenco therefore submitted that the Tribunal must exclude these sites (pits at Oso 9A, Oso 9 B, Oso 9, Pits 2, 4, Yuralpa SL pit, and Yuralpa G, pit 2982) from the total measured contamination in Blocks 7 and 21.983\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraphs 56-57.\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 21.\n\nBy \"total measurable contamination\" the Tribunal refers to the Expert's estimation of the total contamination in those areas of the Blocks which were previously identified by one or the other of the Parties' experts and then sampled and further delineated by the Expert. Due to the Expert's restricted mandate, this is not to be taken as a firm estimate of all of the potential contamination in the two Blocks.\n\n819.\n\nDuring his opening presentation to the Parties and the Tribunal on 11 March 2019, at which he reviewed his work and responded to the Parties' written comments, Mr. MacDonald began by summarising the \"mandates that guided the scope of work.\"984 The first two points on his slide stated:\n\n\"Investigation of soil and groundwater was restricted to areas already sampled by the Parties.\n\nInvestigation of mud pits was limited to those known to have been used by Perenco.\"985\n\nExpert's Direct Presentation, 11 March 2019, p. 1.\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 20.\n\n820.\n\nMr. MacDonald thus differentiated between sampling of soils and groundwater, on the one hand, and sampling of mud pits, on the other. Having regard to the Interim Decision on Counterclaim as a whole, the Tribunal considers that this was a not unreasonable interpretation of the Tribunal's directions. With respect to the first point on Mr. MacDonald's slide, at paragraph 590 of the Interim Decision, the Tribunal stated: \"The Tribunal's expert will therefore confine his/her work to the specific sites at which soil samples were taken and groundwater sampling wells were drilled\u2026.\"986\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 590.\n\n821.\n\nWith respect to mud pits, the Interim Decision on Counterclaim was clear in expressing the Tribunal's intention that Perenco would be liable for any exceedances found in mud pits that Perenco had used. When the general instructions were developed in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim (assuming an expert might have to be appointed), it appeared to the Tribunal that the principal difference between the Parties in respect of mud pits was not the *number* of mud pits that Perenco had used, but rather of that universe of pits, *how many were lined as opposed to unlined* ? This can be seen in the discussion in paragraph 502 of the Interim Decision on Counterclaim:\n\n\"502. The Schedule of Closed Mud Pits attached as Appendix A to the Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief on Counterclaims, which was prepared with both Parties' involvement and for which the Tribunal is grateful, regrettably shows that there are substantial disagreements as to whether many pits were lined or unlined. The 'Master List' records disagreement in at least 26 of 79 cases; the 'Pits Constructed by Perenco' list shows an even higher percentage of disagreement (14 of 18). The 'Pits Constructed by Prior Operators' shows 12 disagreements (of 63 entries) and many (36) unknowns.\"987 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 502.\n\n822.\n\nTo be clear, Perenco did *not* complain that the Independent Expert sampled mud pits that had been used by other operators.988 Perenco did not take issue with the Consolidated Independent Expert Report's statement that:\n\n\"Per the Tribunal, the condition of non-Perenco pits, either those constructed before September 2002 or after July 2009, were not relevant to the claim and were excluded from Ramboll's assessment.\"989\n\nThe Notes to Table 5.1 indicate instances where mud pits were identified as being associated with non-Perenco operations and therefore were not sampled. See notes 4 and 5.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, \"Mud pits\" p. 237, second bullet.\n\n823.\n\nThe Consolidated Independent Expert Report moreover explicitly notes that Mr. MacDonald limited his sampling to the pits that the Parties' representatives *agreed* had been used by Perenco.990 Perenco's grievance is that the Independent Expert either sampled mud pits admittedly used by Perenco but which had not been previously sampled by the Parties' experts991 or that he did not sample certain pits used by Perenco, but rather only inferred contamination of such pits.992\n\n*Ibid.,* Section 7.1. \"Mud Pits\", second paragraph: \"Per the Tribunal, the condition of non-Perenco pits, either those constructed before September 2002 or after July 2009, were not relevant to the claim and were excluded from Ramboll's assessment. The mud pits considered in our work were therefore limited to those that the Parties agreed were associated with prior Perenco operations. All of the Perenco mud pit areas were inspected, and almost all were sampled. \u2026\"\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 93: \"At Oso 9A and 9B, however, Ramboll designates for remediation 7 mud pits even though neither IEMS nor GSI found evidence of exceedances in these sites. Consequently, these areas were beyond the scope of Ramboll's investigation.\"\n\n*Ibid.,* pp. 93-94: \"\u2026Ramboll's own sampling disproves the assumption that adjacent pits have similar contents: Ramboll found that pit 8 in Oso 9 met the performance criteria even though the adjacent pit 9 did not.\"\n\n824.\n\nIt was not the Tribunal's intention that Perenco would be able to avoid liability for any exceedances determined by the Independent Expert for mud pits which Perenco had used. From the Tribunal's perspective, the key objectives insofar as mud pits were concerned were twofold: (i) to have Mr. MacDonald 'get to the bottom' of the lined/unlined pit dispute between the Parties; and (ii) to ensure that Perenco would *not* be held liable for pits constructed by prior operators which it did not use. This was made clear at 604 of the Interim Decision on Counterclaim:\n\n\"604. The same exercise must be performed in relation to the mud pits used by Perenco up to 16 July 2009. Perenco cannot be held liable for pits constructed by prior operators which it itself did not use, because by definition it would be able to show that any damage caused from leachates escaping from such pits cannot be attributed to it. It can only be held liable for damage resulting from the pits which it used or built. It is necessary to ascertain whether the drilling muds were disposed of in a properly constructed sealed pit or disposed of in an unsealed pit or one that was improperly constructed and which therefore may be more susceptible to leaching.\"993 [Emphasis added.]\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 604.\n\n825.\n\nAs part of his planning process, Mr. MacDonald provided a list of mud pits to the Parties for their comment.994 Included on that list were Oso 9A and Oso 9B.995 (Perenco's use of both of these sites had been noted in GSI's 2012 expert report.996) As for the Yuralpa sanitary landfill pit and Yuralpa G, pit 2, the history of Block 21's development is clear: As reflected in GSI's list of wells drilled in Yuralpa, with the exception of three wells drilled by Texaco (Yuralpa 1) and Oryx (Yuralpa Centro 1 and 2), the Yuralpa field was developed by Perenco.997 As for Oso 9, pits 2, 4, these pits were not sampled by Mr. MacDonald, but they were situated within a large mud pit area and the pits surrounding these two (pits 1, 3, and 6998) were sampled. All of those sampled pits showed regulatory exceedances. The estimation of contamination at these two pits resulted from Mr. MacDonald's drawing an inference from the regulatory exceedances which he had confirmed at the surrounding pits.999\n\nThis correspondence was supplemented by discussions with Party representatives. Mr. MacDonald commented: \"\u2026 I think the pit \u2013 I'll call it the \"Pit mandate\" \u2013 was through available information and attempts, very strong attempts, to affirm with the Parties that no one had an objection.\" Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 132:16-19.\n\nDuring the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald noted that he had sent an email or a letter regarding the sampling of Oso 9A and 9B. \"It was clear to us from representations made in the field that those areas received mud pit materials from Perenco.\" Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 130:15-17.\n\nGSI ER I, Appendix L.54 \"Compilation of Site-Specific Information for Oso 09, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 Well Platform, Block 7\", pp. 4 & 9.\n\nGSI took samples / see Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 132.\n\nGSI ER II Appendix B.4, Well List, p. 4.\n\nIndependent Expert Report, Table 5.1: \"Mud Pits 2 and 4 at Oso 9 are associated with Perenco but were not investigated by Ramboll or the Parties. The contents of these two mud pits are likely of similar quality as that found in neighbouring Mud Pit 1 and Mud Pits 3 and 5, respectively.\"\n\n826.\n\nThe Tribunal understood from its mandate discussions with the Independent Expert at the outset of his work that he considered sampling roughly half of Perenco's pits and inferring from the results of that sampling estimates of contamination in the balance of the pits. In the end, Mr. MacDonald did far more sampling than inferring:\n\n\"The mud pits considered in our work were therefore limited to those that the Parties agreed were associated with prior Perenco operations. All of the Perenco mud pit areas were inspected, and almost all were sampled.\"1000 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Id.*, Section 7.1.\n\n827.\n\nGiven what the Tribunal stipulated in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, specifically its stated intention to have all mud pits used by Perenco assessed, the Tribunal does not consider that Mr. MacDonald's reasons for deciding to sample or assign responsibility by means of the limited use of inference to the mud pits listed above at paragraph 818 to be unreasonable. It holds therefore that he did not step outside of his mandate.\n\n*(c) Did the Expert exceed his mandate in not conducting sampling at sites that were sampled by either of the Parties' experts?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n828.\n\nWhile Perenco raised many objections that would, if accepted, have significantly narrowed the scope of contamination found by the Expert, Ecuador raised a different set of issues focusing on Mr. MacDonald's inability or failure, as the case may be, to sample certain sites which were sampled by one or the other of the Parties' experts.\n\n829.\n\nEcuador pointed out that the Expert did not sample every site where contamination was found by one or the other of the Parties' experts. For example, IEMS investigated the groundwater situation at the Yuralpa landfill (\"Yuralpa LF\"), but Ramboll was not able to sample this site due to logistical difficulties.1001 Ecuador argued that since at least one well at every site has a detected exceedance of TPH and/or barium, it would be reasonable to assume that the groundwater at Yuralpa LF would be equally affected.1002 Ecuador noted further that Perenco also installed wells at Yuralpa B and used mud pits at that site. Due to an oversight, Ramboll did not investigate the Perenco mud pits at that site.1003 Given that Mr. MacDonald found that 87% of the mud pits constructed or used by Perenco did not conform to the performance criteria of RAOHE, Ecuador argued that it was reasonable to assume that the mud pits at this site would also not have met the standards prescribed by RAOHE.1004 Finally, during the Expert Hearing, Ecuador referred to evidence that Perenco had disposed of mud pit materials generated at other sites at Payamino 16.1005 Again, considering that 85% of the Perenco mud pits did not conform to RAOHE's performance criteria, Ecuador argued that it is reasonable to assume that the mud pits at this site would also not have conformed to RAOHE.1006\n\nIndependent Expert Report, Section 4.2.4.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, p. 239, paragraph 7.\n\nTr.

(2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 397:8-18.\n\n830.\n\nThe Tribunal has given due consideration to this concern and believes that it is fair, in view of the above circumstances, to adjust upward by US$7.7 million the damages estimated by Mr. MacDonald and found by the Tribunal to be allocable to Perenco.\n\n831.\n\nA related issue is Ecuador's attempt to have the Tribunal increase the damages because of the fact that Perenco performed certain workovers of production wells that had been drilled by its predecessors. Ecuador contended that just as the initial drilling of the production wells would have generated wastes, so too would the workovers. In the period leading up to the Expert Hearing, the Tribunal agreed with Ecuador's request that Perenco produce its workover reports.1007\n\nEcuador's request was set out in its letter of 22 January 2019, p. 2; this request was granted by the Tribunal in its letter dated 8 February 2019.\n\n832.\n\nThis issue was raised relatively late in the proceedings. Perenco objected to this on the grounds that even though seven years ago Perenco produced some evidence about workovers that it had performed, Ecuador was now seeking to expand the record on that historical point, while continuing to withhold the same kind of information about its own operations that actually was relevant to the Tribunal's decision at this stage, *i.e.* records of Petroamazonas' post-July 2009 records of workovers that it had been ordered to produce.1008 (The Tribunal has already expressed its disagreement with Perenco's characterisation of Ecuador's alleged failure to comply with Procedural Order No. 17.)\n\nPerenco's letter to the Tribunal dated 5 February 2019.\n\n833.\n\nIn the end, the Independent Expert agreed with Perenco that the issue had been raised relatively recently and that the workover reports that he had received early on in his work were relatively few in quantity. It was only in the last phase of the counterclaim proceeding that he was given more documentation relating to workovers.1009 From his review of the documentation, although Mr. MacDonald agreed with counsel for Ecuador that workovers typically would generate residues1010, based on the information before him (which indicated the use of drilling fluids, but not what chemical additives were used, nor whether barium sulphate was used), he was unable reasonably to estimate Perenco's potential contribution at sites where workovers were performed.\n\nTr.

(2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 310:15-315:14.\n\n834.\n\nThis is an exercise of technical judgement and the Tribunal declines to second-guess the Independent Expert on this determination. Ecuador's workover claim is therefore rejected.\n\n*(d) The land-use debate*\n-------------------------\n\n835.\n\nDuring his visits to the Blocks, Mr. MacDonald examined the Napo River Basin and the dominant features of the Blocks which he then briefly described in his Report:\n\n\"\u2026 I observed that local topographic conditions of the platforms varied significantly, with some located in hilly regions steep-sloped gullies, others within swampy lowlands, and still others within agricultural settings. Almost all sites, however, were surrounded by rainforest of varying ecological value (e.g., primary and secondary forests; forests with evidence of concurrent agricultural use). As described further\u2026 while some portions of this forest are designated as having special significance, this entire rainforest ecosystem is considered to be environmentally sensitive and to have intrinsic value, regardless of whether it is pristine.\"1011\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, p. 24.\n\n836.\n\nBoth Parties objected to certain land-use designations employed by the Independent Expert. Leaving aside a few other objections to his designations, the main issue of dispute between the Parties on this aspect of the Report was that Ecuador considered that certain sites that the Independent Expert designated as \"agricultural\" should have been designated as \"sensitive ecosystem\" and that that two water bodies should have been classified as sensitive ecosystem areas rather than agricultural.1012 Perenco considered that certain sites that the Independent Expert designated as \"sensitive ecosystem\" should have been considered \"agricultural.\" It is not necessary to repeat the objections in detail; they are set out above at paragraph 670 *et seq* above.\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 10. Ecuador also argued that the Expert failed to fully capture the extent of contamination in the tested areas.\n\n837.\n\nThe approach to be taken by the Independent Expert was set out in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim at paragraph 495, under the heading: \"Conclusion on land-use criteria\":\n\n\"491. \u2026 the Tribunal considers that the treatment of this issue should be guided by the Ecuadorian authorities' practice in relation to the Blocks. The evidence shows that the authorities accepted the application of industrial land-use criteria in certain parts of Blocks 7 and 21, in particular, in the January 2003 Remediation Plan relating to the Payamino Sanitary Landfill, Payamino 22, Payamino CPF, Coca CPF and Jaguar CPF as approved by the Ministry, the report of a clean-up of a spill at Payamino 19 in June 2009, the Consortium's EIS for the construction of the Oso A and Oso B platforms and the Yuralpa Norte platform in April and October 2006, and, most significantly, in the environmental impact studies commissioned by Ecuador in 2010.\n\n492. Ecuadorian authorities similarly accepted the application of agricultural land-use criteria in areas surrounding platforms in Blocks 7 and 21 such as in the Ministry-approved remediation plan for the May 2007 spill from the Oso 2 flow line, the January 2008 Ministry-approved remediation plan for a spill in the Gacela-Payamino flow line in October 2007, and in the environmental impact studies commissioned by Ecuador in 2010. In the present proceeding, IEMS itself accepted that the areas surrounding Coca 6, Coca 8, Lobo 3, Lobo 1, Oso 9, Mono CPF, and Payamino CPF were primarily used for agricultural purposes.\n\n493. This is not to say that, once selected, the land-use criteria are irrevocable and the decision cannot be changed. However, there is significant probative value to be derived from the authorities' acceptance of a particular land-use criterion with respect to the same area for the purpose of measuring soil remediation.\n\n494. It is also clear to the Tribunal that the sensitive ecosystem designation is not limited to designated protected zones. RAOHE makes clear that the designation applies in areas \"such as the National Heritage of Natural Areas *and others* identified in the corresponding Environmental Study.\" GSI's initial approach was to restrict the use of the sensitive ecosystem criterion to those areas alone. The Tribunal notes that GSI itself accepted that the \"sensitive ecosystems criteria\" might apply to a number of sites in the Blocks which intersected with State-designated sensitive ecosystem areas: Payamino CPF, Payamino 1, Payamino 2-8, Payamino 19, Waponi-Ocatoe and Nemoca\".\n\n**(3.1) Conclusion on land-use criteria**\n\n495. The Tribunal concludes that that in view of the 2008 Constitution's imperative in favour of the protection of the environment, in any case of doubt where a site could be considered to fall under either of two designations, the more stringent land-use designation should be applied. In the Tribunal's view, where a posterior land use has not been designated, Article 395.4 of the 2008 Constitution's focus on full restoration should guide in determining the appropriate land use and it should be in favour of the most environmentally-protective designation that is reasonable in the circumstances of the particular case. At the same time, the prior determinations of the Ecuadorian authorities have significant probative value.\" 1013 [Emphasis added.]\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraphs 491-495 [fn. references omitted.]\n\n838.\n\nThis was repeated in a summary form in the Tribunal's Interim Decision on Counterclaim at paragraph 611(15):\n\n\"In any case of doubt as to the applicable land-use criteria, subject to prior determinations of Ecuadorian authorities which have significant probative value, the more stringent land-use designation applies.\"1014\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 611(15).\n\n839.\n\nIn these instructions, the Tribunal wished to give the Independent Expert a degree of latitude to determine what was appropriate in the circumstances of a specific case. If the Ecuadorian authorities had previously made certain land-use determinations, those were to be given \"significant probative value\", but the Tribunal did not intend by this indication to hold that any such prior determinations would be dispositive of the question in specific cases and that the Independent Expert could not use his own judgement given the specific characteristics of a particular site. (Otherwise, the Tribunal would have used words to the effect that \"the Ecuadorian authorities' prior land-use determinations shall govern\".)\n\n840.\n\nIt is important to recall that having sampled the sites, the Independent Expert was then to delineate the extent of contamination (because IEMS' mapping methodology had been rejected and because the Tribunal had doubts about GSI's delineations). Thus, the issue of land-use criteria would arise only once Ramboll had identified the location and type of contamination and delineated its extent. Many of the determinations were not black and white; Mr. MacDonald noted, for example, that TULAS defined agricultural land as including lands that \"maintain a habitat for permanent and transient species, in addition to native flora.\"1015 Thus, reasonable people can differ as to when or whether a particular site that exhibited agricultural characteristics could also have a part thereof which could be considered to be sensitive ecosystem. In the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, the Tribunal recognised that there could be cases of doubt where a site could be considered to fall under either of two designations and directed that in such circumstances, the more stringent designation should be applied. The intention was that the Independent Expert should bear in mind how a particular site had been treated by the authorities in the past, but if for some reason he considered that a more stringent land-use designation should apply, he could so determine. At the same time, however, the Independent Expert was not obliged to default to the sensitive ecosystem designation as Ecuador's submissions seemed to imply. Thus, in some instances, Mr. MacDonald adopted a land-use classification which was favourable to Perenco's position (which Ecuador considered to be insufficiently stringent), and in other instances he adopted a classification which was favourable to Ecuador's position (and contested by Perenco as being unduly stringent).1016\n\nTULAS Book VI, Annex 2, \u00a72.50, cited at Expert's Direct Presentation, Slide 8.\n\nIn his presentation on Day 2 of the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald reacted to both Party's critiques of his designations (dealing with Ecuador's criticism at Slides 7-11 and Perenco's at Slides 39-46.)\n\n841.\n\nMr. MacDonald and his team surveyed the situation in the two Blocks, studied the record of this counterclaim, including prior filings with the Ecuadorian authorities, and consulted Ministry of Agriculture maps. After conducting the sampling activities, they plotted the delineated areas of contamination on some 51 sites (using aerial photographs). The Tribunal considers that it is not in a better position to make these site-by-site land-use determinations and therefore declines to interfere with them.\n\n*(e) Mud pits*\n--------------\n\n842.\n\nThe issue of mud pits is more of a technical issue than a mandate issue, but in view of the amount of time spent on the issue during the course of this counterclaim, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to discuss the Independent Expert's decision to apply RAOHE Table 7(a) to all of Perenco's mud pits.\n\n843.\n\nThe Tribunal has already adverted to the \"lined/unlined mud pit\" controversy. Perenco's historical practice with respect to mud pits was not well-documented. Earlier in this arbitration, after being ordered to produce documents pertaining to the design and construction of mud pits, Perenco stated that it: \"\u2026does not have a specific written policy for the construction, cleaning, monitoring, testing, and closing of pits.\"1017 Perenco relied primarily on Mr. Saltos' testimony and a note of interviews of former employees of Perenco prepared by IEMS as well as some photographic evidence to show that liners were used in some pits. However, the Tribunal was also mindful of a statement made by a former Perenco employee to the effect that even when such liners were laid down, the wastes were not deposited properly.1018 For this reason, the Tribunal found that the evidence \"was mixed and not fully supportive of Perenco's position because one former employee stated that undue care was taken in depositing drilling muds such that the liners cracked under the high temperatures.\"1019 This raised the possibility that even if Perenco lined some pits, the way in which it prepared the pits, mixed the muds, or deposited them in the pits could damage any liners that might have been laid down.\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 501, quoting Perenco's response to Request #12, 18 January 2013.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 501.\n\n*Id.*\n\n844.\n\nMoreover, earlier in the Counterclaim proceeding, Perenco's experts treated all of Perenco's mud pits as if they had been \"sealed\" (essentially equating mud pits with no impermeable liner laid down prior to depositing the mud, but which were said to be lined with clay, with pits with impermeable liners). The Tribunal disapproved of this approach:\n\nThere also appears to be a disagreement on whether a pit which might have been built in clay soil is to be considered to be \"sealed\"; GSI's Mr. Connor believed so, while IEMS did not. The Tribunal is not prepared to equate what have been assumed to be impermeable clay-based pits with those that have been lined within an impermeable synthetic barrier. This would first require the Tribunal to assume that the bottom of an unlined pit was in fact clay. IEMS adduced evidence that this was not necessarily the case; in some instances sandy soil is located near the pits. During cross-examination, Mr. Connor admitted that, for example, when looking at a Coca 8 pit, GSI did not do any geotechnical testing and assumed that the bottom of the pit was lined with clay.1020\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 503.\n\n845.\n\nThe existence of liners capable of acting as an impermeable barrier between the muds and the surrounding soil (and potentially groundwater) is of pivotal importance because RAOHE prescribes two different standards in its Table 7. A stricter standard for the treatment of the muds is applied to unlined pits than that applied to pits which have been lined with an impermeable barrier.\n\n846.\n\nThus, the Independent Expert was instructed to satisfy himself as to the state of the mud pits that Perenco used or constructed. The Tribunal advised that \"if a pit has an impermeable liner, Table 7(b) applies. If there is no impermeable liner, Table 7(a) applies. In any case of doubt, the more environmentally protective standard in Table 7(a) applies.\"1021\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 611 (16).\n\n847.\n\nMr. MacDonald and his team examined the mud pits that had been used by Perenco. Among other things, the mud pits were \"visually inspected to assess the physical integrity of the mud pits, identify the presence of any distinct soil cover layer, and determine whether there was evidence of any synthetic mud pit liner material.\"1022 At footnote 180 of his Report, the Independent Expert commented:\n\n\"The Parties have not provided any direct evidence as to whether liners are present for any specific mud pit. As part of Ramboll's investigation, borings were designed to terminate above the suspected bottom of the mud pit to avoid puncturing any potential liners (if present) and creating a vertical migration pathway for contamination. Photographs taken by Perenco at the time of closure of some mud pits show that an excavator was typically used to treat the mud pit material in place, which likely would have resulted in the tearing or ripping of any liner material that might have been present. Therefore, Ramboll has conservatively assumed that none of the pits are lined or that any liner is likely not intact.\"1023 [Emphasis added.]\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, Section 5.2.1.\n\n*Ibid.,* fn. 142.\n\n848.\n\nHe restated this finding in the comments following Table 5.1, the summary table on mud pits findings:\n\n\"No information was provided sufficient to confirm that synthetic or clay liners are present beneath any specific mud pit. It should be clarified that Ramboll did not drill through the bottom of the mud pits to determine the presence or absence of liner material, since this would have compromised the units if the liners were present. In some cases, Ramboll did observe torn liner material along some mud pit perimeters, but had no information regarding its condition or lateral extent in the rest of the mud pit. Therefore, without exception, the leachability testing data was conservatively compared to the standards for unlined mud pits presented in RAOHE Table 7a.\"1024 [Emphasis added.]\n\nIndependent Expert Report, first bullet after Table 5.1.\n\n849.\n\nThus, in the end, Mr. MacDonald was not persuaded that there was sufficient evidence of competent impermeable liners (*i.e*., liners that, if actually installed prior to disposing of muds, had maintained their integrity) such as to justify applying the less strict standard expressed in RAOHE Table 7(b).1025 In his Opening Direct Presentation at the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald stated that like GSI, Ramboll also observed portions of liner material on the ground surface around some mud pits, but such material \"was observed in only at 8 of the 38 inspected Perenco mud pits (21%), with geogrid observed near the surface of the pits in an additional three mud pits (likely as part of the cover material).\"1026 The closure reports and photographic evidence to which Perenco referred Mr. MacDonald during the Expert Hearing raised questions in his mind. He testified that in two of the three pit closure reports that he had been able to review, even though it appeared that plastic liners had been laid down, Perenco itself had tested the pit contents against the more stringent Table 7(a) of RAOHE rather than the standard applicable to lined pits.1027 He noted further that the photos showed that an excavator was operating within the pit (in order to mix the mud) and opined that this would imperil the integrity of any liner. He observed further that there were gouging markings on the side of the pits which indicated that the excavator was using a bucket with teeth which could cause damage to any liner that had been laid down.1028\n\nDuring the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald testified: \"We only had three mud pit closure reports; Coca 19, Jaguar 9, and Yuralpa landfill. That we looked at. They have pictures. They have some description, they are in Spanish, but I can read Spanish. Jos\u00e9 reads it better than I do. And \u2014but nonetheless, in no instance did the reports describe or show treatment of mud pit materials outside of the mud pits. They show the contrary. Two of the three sites, there is damage to the liners shown in the photos, and if two of the three sites the Contractor for Perenco compared the mud pit testing results, the performance criteria for unlined pits. Okay. So, there's no record and no evidence of competent liners that we've been provided with.\" Tr.

(1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 81:22-82:6.\n\n850.\n\nNotwithstanding Perenco's cross-examination of Mr. MacDonald on the point, given the absence of a written protocol and detailed pit closure reports, as well as the limited photographic evidence of closure practices, together with the Expert and his team's inspection of the sites, the Tribunal considers that Mr. MacDonald was entitled to determine that the more stringent standards should be applied. The Tribunal recalls in this regard its prior instruction that: \"In any case of doubt, the more environmentally protective standard in Table 7(a) applies.\"1029 Therefore, the Tribunal leaves the Expert's approach undisturbed.\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 611(16).\n\n*(f) Groundwater sampling*\n--------------------------\n\n851.\n\nThe Independent Expert was instructed as follows:\n\n\"On the matter of groundwater testing, the expert shall undertake groundwater sampling in accordance with the Tribunal's determination of the appropriate technical standard under Ecuadorian law and industry practice as set out in this Decision. Its sampling shall be confined to the sampling locations identified by IEMS and GSI. Given the effluxion of time, it might be necessary to allocate responsibility for remediation as between Perenco and Petroamazonas. The Tribunal will await the expert's report in this regard.\"1030\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 611(17).\n\n852.\n\nBetween 13 November and 14 December 2017, Ramboll collected samples from 34 permanent monitoring wells installed at 12 sites. The samples were analysed for TPH and metals. The results of the laboratory testing are set out in Table 5.2 of the Report. In summary terms, the Expert found:\n\n\"Based on Ramboll's sampling results, TPH contamination in groundwater above the TULAS standard is present in all 12 investigated sites, and in 74% of sampled monitoring wells. The maximum observed concentration of TPH was 1915 \u00b5g/L at Payamino 2/8, as compared to the TULAS criterion of 325 \u00b5g/L. Barium is found at 58% of the sites, and in 38% of the sampled wells. The maximum observed concentration of barium was 4700 \u00b5g/L at Gacela 1, as compared to the criterion of 338 \u00b5g/L. No other contaminants of concern were identified in the monitoring wells.\"1031\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, third bullet after Table 5.2.\n\n853.\n\nEcuador had no substantial criticisms of the Independent Expert's work in this regard.1032 There appears to be no suggestion by Perenco that Mr. MacDonald sampled at sites not sampled by IEMS or GSI (although he did acknowledge that due to technical considerations, two wells [PAY01-MW03 and JAG02-MW-3] were advanced within areas of high levels of soil contamination).1033\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 51: \"As MacDonald correctly points out at Section 3.2.3 (at p. 43), RAOHE does not specify numerical cleanup standards for groundwater. He thus appropriately proceeded to compare the groundwater Maximum Permissible Limits from TULAS Book VI, Annex 1, Table 5 to the groundwater concentrations determined for barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and TPH. This is precisely what IEMS and GSI did as part of their investigations.\"\n\nE-453.\n\n854.\n\nHowever, Perenco took issue with Mr. MacDonald's application of TULAS' Table 5 groundwater criteria to soils with a clay content greater than 25%, \"even though TULAS specifically excludes such soils from these criteria.\"1034 Perenco argued that if a soil contained a clay content of greater than 25%, the regulation simply did not apply. During the Expert Hearing, counsel for Perenco cross-examined Mr. MacDonald on the point and during the expert witness conferencing session he also elicited testimony from GSI's Mr. Bianchi to this effect.1035 Mr. MacDonald disagreed with Mr. Bianchi on this point.1036\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, p. 58.\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 269:3-12: \"one thing that is very clear in Ecuador, and it's not that different in other countries in the region, when the regulations state something, you stick to that regulation. And if it says 25 percent clay \u2014I don't know the word in English \u2014\" *fiscalizar* \"\u2014 you can't be regulated when you're not falling within the regulation. It just doesn't apply. So, in the case when clay is greater than 25 percent, the regulation doesn't apply, and it says that. It applies when it's less than 25 percent.\" See also Perenco's Closing Presentation, Tr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 433-434.\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 269:13-270:4: \"This is one we might just have to disagree about, which is okay. But, again, we were \u2014I was not precluded from reading the regulations, interpreting then, nor of having conversations with other consultants in Ecuador, including environmental counsel where I was pushing and probing. It's no different than the TPH issue. It's very clear, for example, in RAOHE, that there is absolute freedom to suggest alternative analysis under those regulations, and I interpret TULAS to be no different. So, again, I think we have a different view on this one.\"\n\n855.\n\nThe Tribunal sees both sides to this disputed point and the result is a closer call than for the preceding issues. It is odd that the table specifies a clay percentage at all and for that reason Perenco's argument is hardly implausible. But TULAS does not go on to state that if the clay content of the soil is greater than 25%, there is no need to investigate and/or remediate the groundwater for contaminants. In this sense, the Tribunal can see the logic of the position taken by the Independent Expert.\n\n856.\n\nIn the end, the Tribunal has decided to accept Mr. MacDonald's approach for the following two reasons.\n\n857.\n\nFirst, the Independent Expert's summary of groundwater investigation findings (Table 5.2) lists the lithology, in terms of percentage of clay, of each site and it shows variability in such percentages at a site. For example, Mono 1, CPF records a clay content of 34.1% to the north of the platform, 14.9% to the northeast of the platform, 38.8% to the east of the platform in the mud discharge area and 18.2% to the south of the platform.1037 The Tribunal sees force in the point made by Ecuador that the clay content of soils can vary, sometimes substantially, at a particular site and it makes little sense to exclude groundwater contamination manifesting itself in wells drilled in soils containing more than 25% clay content when there are neighbouring wells drilled in soil that contains less than 25% clay content that also manifest contamination.1038 The Tribunal shares Ecuador's concern that variability in clay content could lead to ineffective remediation if the 25% \"cutoff rule\" contended for were to be applied.\n\nConsolidated Expert Report, Table 5.2, p. 99.\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 403:7-19.\n\n858.\n\nSecond, and related to the point just made, Mr. MacDonald pointed out at the Expert Hearing that the permanent wells installed by Ramboll were able to capture groundwater irrespective of the clay content of the soil.1039 In his words:\n\n\"There's evidence of groundwater impairment at all wells. We meet the definition of groundwater. There is no narrative in TULAS that says there isn't some remedial obligation if you have more than 25 percent clay, for example. So, that's what we did.\"1040\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 70:14-18: \"water encountered by Ramboll at all sampling locations meets the definition of \"groundwater\" by TULAS, subsurface water that is located in the saturated zone where all pore space filled with water at or above the atmospheric pressure.\"\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 71:14-19. In response to Perenco's contention that the groundwater samples had been misinterpreted and the chromatograms really showed plant wax, the Expert noted: \"\u2026for those wells where it believed we weren't \u2014the findings weren't reflective of petroleum, in each and every well the groundwater had changed, it had odors, in some cases we had petroleum droplets, in some cases there was weathered crude in areas where we put the monitoring wells.\" Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 77:17-22.\n\n859.\n\nThe Tribunal takes from his testimony that TULAS sets standards for the protection of groundwater, not clay, and if the water extracted from a well (irrespective of the percentage of clay content of the soil from which the groundwater was drawn) is contaminated, the TULAS standards should apply.1041\n\nExpert's Direct Presentation, Slide 64; Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 70-71.\n\n860.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal leaves the Independent Expert's approach undisturbed.1042\n\nAs noted previously, it was contended that the Expert's groundwater samples were starkly different from the results obtained by IEMS and GSI, But Mr. MacDonald pointed out in his Direct Presentation, Slide 68, that: \"Neither IEMS nor GSI has made their data available, nor provided details; thus, cannot comment on what is described as remarkably different results.\"\n\n*(g) Did the Expert adhere to the Tribunal's instruction that when estimating costs of any remediation for which Perenco is liable, \"he shall be guided by Ecuadorian costs\"?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n861.\n\nPerenco asserted that, in contravention of the Tribunal's instructions, Ramboll's unit costs for remediation do not reflect local costs.1043 It complained that Ramboll never provided a copy of its quotes for the Parties' verification1044 but instead generated its soil remediation numbers through a database (the \"RACER\" database) developed in the United States.1045 These numbers, Perenco argued, substantially exceeded GSI's unit costs, which themselves had been based on the upper range of actual local costs.1046\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 65 and fn. 137; Perenco's Closing Presentatino, Slide 45.\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 66.\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 48 referring to Mr. MacDonald's testimony at Tr.

(2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 504:3-21; Perenco's Rebuttal Presentation, p. 2.\n\n862.\n\nPerenco also asserted that Ramboll's two quotes from two local contractors, Hidrogeocol Ecuador and Ecuambiente, were obtained belatedly in the process of the Expert's finalising his report and were not reliable guides. Hidrogeocol's unit cost for transportation and treatment of soil contaminated with TPH and heavy metals amounted to $260/m\u00b3, six times higher than Petroamazonas' actual unit cost of $39/m\u00b3 for comparable remediation work.1047 Similarly, Ecuambiente's unit cost for transportation and treatment of soils with just TPH was $56/m\u00b3, while Petroamazonas' actual unit cost was $46/m\u00b3 for comparable remediation work.1048 In Perenco's view, the Expert did not appear to have obtained a range of quotes from other contractors nor to have taken account of the fact that quotes provided to foreign companies \u2014especially in the context of litigation\u2014 are typically higher.1049\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 70, contrasting Independent Expert Report, Appendix 19.C with CE-CC-451.\n\n*Id.*\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 70.\n\n863.\n\nPerenco submitted, therefore, that the Tribunal should apply the actual costs recently incurred by Petroamazonas itself, which provide the \"best guide for estimating comparable remediation works.\"1050 These were available from Petroamazonas' own public documents and they showed, in Perenco's submission, that remediation works in Blocks 7 and 21 were substantially lower than Ramboll's estimates, *e.g.* $39/m\u00b3 for treatment and disposal of soil with TPH and metals, as compared to Ramboll's estimate of $160/m\u00b3.1051\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 72, referring to Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 579.\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 69, contrasting Independent Expert Report, Appendix 19.C and Appendix 19.B with CE-CC-451.\n\n864.\n\nIn sum, Perenco's criticism of the Independent Expert's approach to unit costs was that even though Ramboll claimed that RACER was used only as a reference,1052 it had actually relied on RACER estimates rather than the belatedly obtained local quotes from Hidrogeocol or Ecuambiente (which were also exaggerated, given the litigation context) or more appropriately, Petroamazonas' costs, as evidenced by publicly-available documents.1053\n\nPerenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 49.\n\n*Id.*\n\n865.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it useful to set out Mr. MacDonald's explanation of Ramboll's costs \"solicitation process.\"1054 The first part of his explanation referred to various criticisms made by Perenco and addressed them in turn:\n\nBelated solicitation of quotes1055: \"So, one here is that we appear to receive the quotes in late November and December [of 2018]. \u2026 but the actual quote \u2014what we'll call 'solicitation process,' began much earlier in the year.\n\nWhat was in the Expert Report was simply the most recent communication that we had. It was not to suggest that that was the date we got some information and in two weeks' time we put it all together. \u2026 So, our solicitation process began, really, in the first quarter of 2018 and, again, the December quotes are simply the latest versions after many revisions and clarifications between folks that we reached out to in Ecuador.\n\nToo few quotes : Ramboll does not appear to have obtained a range of quotes from other contractors. Actually, that's not true. That quote or cost information were solicited from seven contractors in Ecuador and actually total of 11. Four didn't have an interest. But there were communications with several and I'll explain in a minute how we did this, taking into account quotes provided to foreign companies are higher.\"1056\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 84:18.\n\nFor ease of reading, the Tribunal has inserted subject titles into this extract of the transcript.\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 84:14-15, 17-19-85:1, 4-18.\n\n866.\n\nMr. MacDonald then discussed the safeguards that Ramboll took in an attempt to ensure that higher quotes would not be provided either due to its being a foreign company or because the quotes were being used in the context of litigation and therefore might be inflated:\n\n\"\u2026 we solicited and utilized a consultant in Ecuador, Hidrogeocol. \u2026 they're consultants, and they oversee remedial work and believed that them asking for certain things would be faster , more effective than us because they are local.\n\nThey know each other, and we think generally that proved true.\n\nThe other thing is that these quotes, you know, in a litigation context, are typically higher. We required Hidrogeocol to sign a nondisclosure agreement, so details of the Project, identity of the, I mean \u2014sure, people know what's going on in eastern Amazon, sure, to some degree, but we addressed this by just this factor.\n\nSo, he was talking to them on a local level, not in the context of litigation, not in the context of a U.S. entity, you know, per se, to try to get as true as information as possible. And, well, we did\u2014it was an iterative process and we certainly, over time, incorporated them into our remedial cost estimation.\"1057 [Emphasis added.]\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 85:20-21, 86:2-21.\n\n867.\n\nMr. MacDonald then explained how RACER was used in Ramboll's cost estimation process:\n\n\"We used RACER. RACER is a database which contains information on many, many projects, 1500 or so from global locations.\n\nAnd the idea actually\u2014for full disclosure, the U.S. Air Force developed this database\u2026 And over time it became a global database, inputting information from other companies' similar projects. And we use RACER as a bit of a litmus test, confirmation resource, and particularly when there are variations between costs from local contractors, the only costs that had some component of\u2014I'll call it \"RACER thinking\" related to the treatment, transportation, disposal of soils. \u2026\n\nIn particular, and that was because we've seen a wide range of costs coming out of Ecuador, and we wanted to see how it felt, sort of looked within the context of RACER as a sort of a litmus test and a lot of folks think that the estimates within RACER often come within 10 percent of actual remediation costs.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that holds true in each and every case, but it is actual experiences companies have had in different places in the world; so why not look at it? It was a supplemental reference, but most all of our costs came from this iterative process of getting actual unit cost pricing from local contractors in Ecuador.\"1058 [Emphasis added.]\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 87:1-88:5.\n\n868.\n\nGiven the above explanations, the Tribunal accepts that what looked from a reading of the Independent Expert Report at first blush to be a last-minute push to find some remedial cost estimates, was in fact the culmination of a more deliberative process that had gone on for roughly eight months with the intermediation of a local Ecuadorian firm subject to non-disclosure obligations. It further accepts Mr. MacDonald's view that the \"use of RACER does not negate the fact that [Ramboll's] costs are very heavy Ecuador-oriented\"1059 and that RACER was used as a \"confirmatory tool.\"1060 The Tribunal notes that Perenco has argued that Ramboll's estimated costs were higher than the numbers provided in the Ecuambiente quote1061 but as Mr. MacDonald testified, the unit pricing Ramboll received \"came out of Ecuador\"1062, but was too low for the conceptual remediation plan that he and his team developed and therefore the estimates were adjusted upwards.1063 The Tribunal accepts that this as a proper exercise of Mr. MacDonald's professional judgement.\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 205:1-2.\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 204:16-17.\n\nSee Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 46.\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 202:10.\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 203:21-22; 209:21-210:2.\n\n869.\n\nFinally, with respect to its argument that the Tribunal should apply Petroamazonas' costs, Perenco relied on Petroamazonas' 2018 Incinerox waste management contract (and a statement in its 2017 bond offering from which Perenco calculated the cost of the remediation that Petroamazonas had performed), asserting that these are valid prices given that they were obtained through \"an open proposal and bid process\"1064 which is \"a good way to get low prices\"1065. In its closing submissions, Perenco highlighted the following text from these documents:\n\n2018 Petroamazonas Contract\n\n\"Clause Five: Scope of the Work.-\n\n5.3 - Treatment and/or final disposal of the removed waste, owing, for that purpose, to comply with the environmental legal requirements applicable to waste managers and all applicable environmental regulations.\"1066 Petroamazonas' 2017 Bond Offering\n\n\"On July 1, 2013, Petroamazonas' board established Project Amazonia Viva, which was later approved by the Ministry of the Environment on June 3, 2014. This project seeks to eliminate sources of pollution and remediate contaminated soils, which resulted from exploration and production activities predating Petroamazonas' own operations. Currently, the project encompasses elimination and remediation efforts in exploration blocks 11 (Bermejo), 56 (Lago Agrio), 57 (Shushufindi Libertador), 58 (Cuyabeno), 60 (Sacha), and 61 (Auca), which are carried out in accordance with the Public Policy on Comprehensive Reparation and existing environmental regulations, under the supervision and monitoring of the Ministry of the Environment. For the period ending December 31, 2016, approximately 364,240 cubic meters of soil were remediated and 191 sources of pollution were eliminated as part of Project Amazonia Viva. As a result, Petroamazonas was able to recover approximately 4,959 barrels of crude oil during the 2016 period. To date, Petroamazonas has remediated approximately 732,956 cubic meters of soil and eliminated 520 sources of pollution since the implementation of Project Amazonia Viva in 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Petroamazonas incurred expenses of approximately U.S.$23.1 million for the implementation of Project Amazonia Viva. For 2017, Petroamazonas has an annual budget of U.S.$26.6 million for such project. As of October 2017, Petroamazonas has invested approximately U.S.$19.4 million in this project.\"1067 [Perenco's emphasis]\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 504:20-21.\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 505:1-2.\n\nCE-CC-451, Section 5.3; see Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 53.\n\nCE-CC-446, p. 86; see Perenco's Closing Presentation, Slide 56.\n\n870.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the Incinerox contract issue, in particular, because it is related to Petroamazonas' own remediation efforts in the Blocks and therefore seems to be highly relevant.\n\n871.\n\nAt the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald pointed out that there was \"significant variability\" in the unit costs provided to Petroamazonas. For example, while Perenco pointed to a contractor who evidently provided soil remediation services for TPH and metals at a cost of US$39.06/m3, a different Petroamazonas contract carried a price of US$455.88/m3, *some 12 times higher*, for remediation services.1068 Mr. MacDonald noted further that the scope in the Incinerox contractual documents did not identify the specific remedial technologies that would be employed. Therefore, he was skeptical of the suggestion that there really was true comparability between the Incinerox contract's services and what he contemplated should be done:\n\n\"\u2026We've seen a couple of these RFPs. I cite two of them here, for soil remediation of petroleum and metals, $39 a cubic meter to $455 a cubic meter. Our unit pricing was 160, $150-160 a cubic meter. And \u2014but the scope in Petroamazonas' contract documents did not identify specific remedial technologies. So, you have to know more in order to determine whether there's a valid comparison.\n\nSo, and it doesn't mean that our unit cost pricing is unreasonable. We believe that it's not.\"1069 [Emphasis added.]\n\nAnd:\n\n\"it's not clear specifically whether if some treatments contemplated what is it and where is it embedded in these costs. So, I think we're very confident in the unit pricing that we've developed for treatment, transportation, and disposal. What's also clear in Ecuador is that the kinds of materials and the contamination at these sites do require treatment. It's not a direct excavate, transport, dispose. So, there's a treatment component and that has to be carefully understood and clear. And at least from my initial glance of this, it wasn't entirely clear whether treatment was contemplated or not.\"1070 [Emphasis added.]\n\nExpert's Direct Presentation, Slide 91.\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 90:3-13.\n\nIbid., 245:12-246:3; see also Ecuador's Closing Submissions, p. 23.\n\n872.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the Independent Expert's doubts that the services contemplated by the Incinerox-Petroamazonas contract are comparable in scope and sophistication to what is required to implement his remediation plan.\n\n873.\n\nThe Tribunal notes further Mr. MacDonald's concern that the reverse auction process employed by Petroamazonas serves to bring costs down but \"it's not guaranteeing that there isn't some effect \u2026 of work quality.\"1071 Perenco itself adverted to this in its closing submissions and it is an important point, in the Tribunal's view.1072\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 284:6-11.\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 505:1-4: The reverse auction process, \"Mr. MacDonald acknowledges, is a good way to get low prices, although he doesn't like that it could have negative consequences if vendors don't comply with their obligations.\"\n\n874.\n\nMr. MacDonald moreover did not believe that it could be assumed that Petroamazonas' costs are reflective of local costs in general. He testified in this regard at the hearing:\n\n\"Now, here's the thing with Petroamazonas, and, yes, they do some of their own remedial work; right? Whether it's spills, releases, other things, and they are doing it themselves; \u2026 so, they themselves might provide things like security, and community relations, and areas for equipment storage, and all the infrastructure, and borrowed materials and, I mean, various other things that might go into a remediation project, but that's different than a potentially then a third-party implementing remedial work on behalf of a responsible party.\n\nSo there is no basis for us to assume at this stage that if any remedial work is done that is done by Petroamazonas. I don't know that, as opposed to a third-party contractor. And I suspect that \u2014but, again, I don't know, but they would have to be very dedicated resources, so I didn't see here that it was our job to try to handicap our costs assuming that Petroamazonas would implement any remedial work at the end as opposed to a third party\u2026.1073 [Emphasis added.]\n\nTr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 89:2-90:1.\n\n875.\n\nIn the end, the Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. MacDonald's costs are usable, reasonable and consistent with the Tribunal's prior direction that local unit costs be employed.\n\n**4. The Tribunal's quantification of the damages payable by Perenco**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n876.\n\nHaving reflected on the evidence and the Parties' submissions, the Tribunal began by seeking to focus on the \"knowns\" of the contamination identified by the Independent Expert. Contamination associated with Perenco's mud pits and wells were first addressed. As for the other forms of contamination, the Tribunal focused on: (i) the type of contamination; (ii) where the contamination was located; (iii) whether the substances detected were associated with drilling or with ongoing oilfield operations; (iv) whether any of the wells where the contamination was found were drilled by Perenco; (v) how long a platform had been used before Perenco arrived on the scene; (vi) whether there was record evidence showing spills or other contamination at the site prior to, or during, Perenco's operatorship; and (vii) whether, in the case of groundwater contamination, the groundwater monitoring well at which the contamination was detected was proximate to contamination or a site feature (*e.g*., mud pit, formation water pit) which had already been attributed to either a predecessor or to Perenco.1074 The Tribunal also took note of instances where Perenco accepted partial or full responsibility for contamination at a particular site or area of a site.\n\nSome groundwater contamination was attributed to a likely source (say a mud pit). If it was non-Perenco, then all remedial responsibilities were assigned the predecessor(s) (*e.g*., Coca-2-MW1), and if Perenco's, then all remedial responsibilities were assigned to Perenco (*e.g*., Oso 9).\n\n877.\n\nIf a site was one which was contaminated by barium and the well had been drilled by a Perenco predecessor, the Tribunal decided that contamination should not be attributed to Perenco. For example, Lobo 01 was drilled in February 1989; 100% of the remediation costs ($1,361 m) was allocated to the 'Perenco predecessors' responsibility bucket'.\n\n878.\n\nConversely, if an incident of contamination was indubitably tied to Perenco's operations (Perenco-drilled wells and mud pits being the leading examples), or one for which Perenco accepted partial or full responsibility (*e.g*., Mono CPF, where Perenco accepted responsibility for \"some costs\" for an oil spill in 20081075), the estimated remediation costs associated therewith were included in 'Perenco's responsibility bucket'. For example, the Jaguar 9 production wells were drilled by Perenco in July 2004. The $541,000 for soil remediation found by the Independent Expert was allocated entirely to Perenco's responsibility bucket.\n\nAnnex 1 to Perenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, p. 15.\n\n879.\n\nLikewise, the mud pits at Oso 9, 10-12, 15-20 give rise to a $5,317 million remediation cost and a groundwater remediation cost of $3,415 million. Both were allocated to Perenco. The Tribunal reasoned in this regard that groundwater impairment areas adjacent to mud pits or former formation water pits were more likely than not to be associated with those structures and were therefore attributed to the entities that constructed or used them.1076 (The Tribunal also considered that in some cases it could not discount contributions by Petroamazonas to groundwater impairment (*e.g.* the API separator at Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF). Hence for groundwater impairment remediation costs, in those cases, the Tribunal not only allocated costs as between Perenco and its predecessors, but also included Petroamazonas in the time-weighted allocation.)\n\nAn example going in the opposite direction is Coca 2. The impairment north of the formation water pit and west of the mud pit was fully attributed to predecessors.\n\n880.\n\nAs noted above at paragraph 877, the Tribunal also considered the type of contaminant. Barium was associated with well drilling and allowed the Tribunal to allocate barium exceedances to the category of the drilling operator (*i.e*., Perenco or its predecessors). Where the environmental media were affected by TPH, the Tribunal considered that this was a result of an operational release of crude oil. Such operational releases could occur before, during, or after Perenco's operatorship.\n\n881.\n\nThus, for certain issues, particularly in the areas of soil and groundwater contamination, the time-based allocation method was also employed. Given that contamination can occur from ongoing operational mishaps and mix with contamination caused by previous operators, allocating responsibility based on time of operations is, in the Tribunal's view, an appropriate method to deal with the uncertainty.\n\n882.\n\nAs a result of this exercise, the Tribunal considered that responsibility could fall within five combinations of persons responsible therefor:\n\n(i) Instances where the contamination identified by the Independent Expert was attributable to Perenco's predecessors only (for example at sites where exceedances of barium alone or with other metals were associated with well drilling conducted by a prior operator);\n\n(ii) instances where the contamination was attributable to Perenco (for example where exceedances of barium alone or with other metals was associated with well drilling by Perenco or in the case of Perenco's mud pits);\n\n(iii) instances where the contamination was attributable to Perenco, its predecessors and its successor (for example, where each used a particular operational structure (*e.g*., an API separator) at a site where groundwater impairment was found);\n\n(iv) instances where the contamination was attributable to Perenco and its predecessors, but not to Petroamazonas (due to the limitations on the Independent Expert's sampling discussed above which lessened the chances of post-Perenco contamination being found); and\n\n(v) instances where the contamination was attributable to Perenco and Petroamazonas (due to the fact that the site was developed by Perenco and Petroamazonas continued operations there).\n\n883.\n\nIn the latter three combinations, in some instances, the Tribunal allocated the costs of remediation as between Perenco and another party or parties based on record evidence of timing of well drilling and/or mud pit construction and use, spills or other incidents, and taking into consideration Perenco's express assumption of responsibility (but not being bound by any limitations contained therein). In other cases, the time-weighted approach was employed when the record evidence could not be used to discern between Perenco's predecessors' activities and those of Perenco.\n\n884.\n\nFor example, with respect to Jaguar 01, which was drilled from November 1987 to January 1988 and operated by Perenco's predecessors before Perenco arrived on the scene, in Annex 1 to Perenco's comments on the Independent Expert's Report, Perenco assumed responsibility for \"some costs\" for soil and groundwater remediation.1077 The Tribunal has fixed responsibility on Perenco for the impact of TPH contamination around the valve station, which had resulted from an oil spill reported in 2005-06, as well as partial responsibility for the swampy area downslope of the valve station. In this case, the Tribunal has allocated US$1,997 million to Perenco's predecessors and US$1,107 million to Perenco. (The latter figure does not include US$438,000 for remediation of TPH detected in groundwater which the Tribunal attributes to a release in 2005/06, during Perenco's operatorship.)\n\nAnnex 1 to Perenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, pp. 2 & 5 (based on Ramboll's Estimated Costs).\n\n885.\n\nSimilarly, in Jaguar 02, drilled in January 1994 and taken out of service in 2000, and therefore only operated by Perenco's predecessors, there was a pre-existing non-Perenco mud pit which experienced a slope failure. This was not attributed to Perenco. Contamination in the barium and other metals-affected areas northeast of the platform, west of the mud pit, and along the northern stream was also attributed to Perenco's predecessors. For the areas with surficial crude resulting from the spill in 2006, Perenco was considered wholly responsible. In Annex 1 of Perenco's comments on the Report, Perenco assumed responsibility for \"some costs\" associated with soil remediation due to an oil spill \"of unknown date\" and \"some costs\" for groundwater remediation.1078 In the result, a small part of the responsibility was allocated to Perenco (US$196,000 for Perenco versus US$8,308 million to its predecessors).\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 2.\n\n886.\n\nIn cases of likely layering of contamination by successive operators, the Tribunal employed a time-based allocation of remedial costs based on Perenco's length of operatorship as a percentage of (i) its predecessors' operatorships, (ii) Petroamazonas' operatorship, or (iii) both. The timeframe selected to allocate responsibility as between Perenco and its predecessors assumed that releases to the environment began at the time of the first production well installation and continued through to July 2009. For affected areas that could be attributed to CPF operations, the initial release was assumed to have occurred when the CPF was constructed. In this respect, the allocation of responsibility to Perenco is conservative, because it does not consider the possibility of later contaminant release dates and the fact that not all of the oil fields were actively exploited by prior operators after the date of first production well installation.\n\n887.\n\nTime-weighted sharing was used for soil contamination (when the record evidence could not be used to allocate costs, as noted in paragraph 883 above), and groundwater impairment. For example, with respect to the Gacela 02/CPF, for the groundwater impairment downstream of the API separator, the Tribunal considered it appropriate to allocate some responsibility to Petroamazonas due to its continued use of the separator. For the groundwater impairment to the southeast of the facility, the soil samples were collected shortly after Perenco's tenure came to an end and responsibility therefor is allocated as between Perenco and its predecessors. As a result, Perenco was assigned US$452,530 in remedial costs, its predecessors were assigned US$458,990, and Petroamazonas was assigned US$485,480 in remediation costs.\n\n888.\n\nThe approach taken by the Tribunal, as just described, had been applied to each site and the results of this process are set out in Annex A to this Award which sets forth the Tribunal's findings in tabular form for: (i) sites where Perenco used mud pits and/installed crude oil production wells; (ii) sites where responsibility for soil remediation is allocated between prior operators and Perenco; (iii) groundwater sites where responsibility is allocated between prior operators, Perenco, and Perenco's successor; and (iv) certain other sites that the Tribunal has accepted give rise to responsibility on Perenco's part.\n\n889.\n\nApplying the foregoing approaches, the remedial responsibilities estimated by Mr. MacDonald in the Independent Expert Report were allocated as follows (prior to further adjustment):\n\n**A. Mud pits and Perenco-installed wells**\n\nThe total remedial estimate of **US$50,017,000** is associated with sites where Perenco used mud pits or installed production wells.\n\nOf this sum:\n\n**US$49,604,320** is attributed to Perenco,\n\n**US$114,080** is attributable to Perenco's predecessors, and\n\n**US$298,600** is attributable to Perenco's successor.\n\n**B. Other soil remediation**\n\nFor sites operated by Perenco where it did not use mud pits or install production wells, total remedial costs for soils amount to **US$88,538,000**.\n\nOf this sum:\n\nApplying the time-based allocation method, **US$27,522,810** is attributed to Perenco, and\n\n**US$61,015,190** is attributable to Perenco's predecessors.\n\n**C. Groundwater**\n\nTotal remedial costs for groundwater amount to **US$21,326,000**.\n\nOf this sum:\n\nApplying the time-based allocation method, **US$8,856,760** is attributed to Perenco:\n\n**US$11,250,680** is attributable to Perenco's predecessors, and\n\n**US$1,218,550** is attributable to Perenco's successor.\n\nThe total attributed to Perenco before adjustment is **US****$85,938,890**.\n\n**D. Adjustment**\n\nThe Tribunal has found that it must make an upward adjustment to this figure to account for certain sites identified by Ecuador which the Expert overlooked or was unable to sample. It has thus added the sum of US$7.7 million for remediation of mud pits at Payamino 16 and Yuralpa B, and the remediation of groundwater at the Yuralpa landfill.\n\nThis brings the total to **US****$93,638,890**.\n\n**5. Effect of the** ***Burlington*** **award**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n890.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the issue of how to deal with the *Burlington* award. It will be recalled that that tribunal left it to the present Tribunal to sort out the question of potential double-recovery of damages.1079\n\nThe Tribunal noted at paragraph 1086 of its Decision on Counterclaims: \"As of the date of the present Decision, the *Perenco* tribunal has issued no decision yet on the counterclaims before it. Therefore, this Tribunal lacks the necessary information or basis to adopt any specific measures \u2013 to fashion its decision, to borrow Ecuador's phrase \u2013 to prevent double recovery, a task that it must leave to the *Perenco* tribunal as the one deciding in second place. This being said, this Tribunal nonetheless states that, as a matter of principle, the present Decision cannot serve and may not be used to compensate Ecuador twice for the same damage.\"\n\n891.\n\nIn the latest phase of this proceeding Ecuador has not disputed that there is a substantial territorial overlap between the contamination to be remediated as estimated by Mr. MacDonald and that estimated by the *Burlington* tribunal.1080 It is evident, however, that Mr. MacDonald identified for remediation larger areas and additional volumes of soil contamination, additional mud pits and additional sites with groundwater contamination, and used higher in-country remediation costs than the *Burlington* tribunal estimated.1081 Ecuador argued that Mr. MacDonald thus did not find the same harm as the *Burlington* tribunal and Perenco remained liable for the additional and/or different remedial areas, volumes and costs.1082\n\nEcuador's Cover Submissions dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 80.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id.*\n\n892.\n\nEcuador therefore proposed a framework based on a site-by-site comparison of areas, depths, volumes and costs between identified by Mr. MacDonald and the *Burlington* tribunal.1083 In case of any uncertainty, Ecuador stated that it had assumed there was an overlap and gave credit to Perenco. Under the framework, on Ecuador's analysis, Perenco was liable for US$130,801,100:1084\n\n(a) **Soils**: Perenco was liable for the additional remedial volumes and costs for the following: (i) sites for which the *Burlington* tribunal did not award any remedial costs; (ii) sites where Mr. MacDonald delineated different areas; sites or areas where Mr. MacDonald's sampling concluded that contamination extended beyond or deeper than the *Burlington* tribunal's findings; (iii) sites or areas where the horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination estimated by Mr. MacDonald and the Burlington tribunal were similar, but in respect of which Mr. MacDonald estimated higher remediation costs.1085\n\n(b) **Mud pits**: Perenco was liable for the higher remediation costs at C\u00f3ndor Norte and the Payamino WTS as well as the full remediation costs estimated for non-compliant mud pits at 11 sites, for a total of US$ 28,304,000.1086\n\n(c) **Groundwater**: Perenco was liable for the nine additional sites identified by Mr. MacDonald as requiring groundwater remediation and the estimated higher costs for the remediation of Coca 2/CPF.1087\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 81 and Appendix A.\n\nAppendix A to Ecuador's Cover Submissions dated 22 February 2019.\n\nEcuador's Cover Submissions dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 82.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 83.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 84.\n\n893.\n\nIn addition, Ecuador argued that it was entitled to abandonment costs in addition to the US$929,722 granted by the *Burlington* tribunal for the seven sites listed in Perenco's November 2008 Well Site Abandonment Plan that was never carried out and which sites Petroamazonas never operated.1088\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 85.\n\n894.\n\nPerenco's argument on this point in essence was that the *Burlington* payment pursuant to the Settlement Agreement \"irrevocably, fully and finally paid and discharged, and satisfied\" all of the Consortium's obligations and liabilities related to Ecuador's counterclaims.1089 If that argument was not accepted, at the very least, in Perenco's submission, that amount paid must be set off from any remediation costs that this Tribunal might award to Ecuador in this proceeding.1090 Perenco argued that Ecuador did not dispute this.1091 Applying its proposed corrections to Mr. MacDonald's findings, which would result in damages lower than what Ecuador had already received in full satisfaction of its counterclaims, the Tribunal should enter an award of zero counterclaims damages.1092\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 74, and referring to CE-CC-431, Annex 3, p. 4, paragraph 2.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 74, and referring to CE-CC-431, Annex 3, p. 3, WHEREAS (5).\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 74.\n\n*Id.*\n\n895.\n\nThe Tribunal obviously has charted a different course from that proposed by either Party. It has not estimated damages of US$130,801,100 payable to Ecuador by Perenco, nor has it agreed with Perenco's 'zero counterclaims damages' contention.\n\n896.\n\nBy the time of the Expert Hearing, Ecuador was acknowledging that a substantial overlap environmental damages existed between the US$39,199,373 awarded by *Burlington* and what Mr. MacDonald has found. (At the Expert Hearing, Ecuador indicated that the maximum amount subject to double-recovery was US$29,078,900.)1093 Mindful of the *Burlington* tribunal's statement that \"as a matter of principle, the present Decision cannot serve and may not be used to compensate Ecuador twice for the same damage\"1094, the Tribunal has thought long and hard about how to protect against double recovery.\n\nSee Appendix A to Ecuador's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, \"Totals.\"\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 1086.\n\n897.\n\nThe two tribunals have addressed the issues in significantly different ways, both substantively, in terms of their findings on Ecuadorian law, and technically, in terms of evaluating the expert evidence of contamination in the Blocks. The *Burlington* tribunal relied upon IEMS' and GSI's sampling as augmented by the tribunal's site visit to the Blocks. The present Tribunal had doubts about the work of both side's experts and opted to make the main findings on Ecuadorian law that would allow the Parties the possibility to negotiate a settlement and if they were unable to do so, the Tribunal indicated its intention to appoint an independent expert.\n\n898.\n\nNo disrespect at all is intended to the distinguished members of the *Burlington* tribunal, each of whom the present Tribunal holds in high regard, by the present Tribunal's deciding that Mr. MacDonald was better situated than that tribunal to estimate the extent of contamination. The work performed by Mr. MacDonald and his team from Ramboll is more likely to have comprehensively and accurately analysed the work of IEMS/GSI (both their strengths and weaknesses) than the *Burlington* tribunal was able to do. After thoroughly reviewing that work and designing a further sampling campaign in consultation with the Parties, Mr. MacDonald was, in the present Tribunal's view, in a far better position to capture and delineate the extent of the contamination in the areas of the Blocks that he was permitted to measure. Hence, the Tribunal has decided to treat the US$39,199,373 awarded by the *Burlington* tribunal, and paid by Burlington in its settlement, as a down payment towards the total amount of damages that the present Tribunal has determined are payable by Perenco, the actual operator of the Consortium.\n\n899.\n\nThe grand total after adjustments of US$93,638,890 stated above at paragraph 889 is thus further adjusted by crediting to Perenco the prior payment of US$39,199,373 to arrive at a figure of US$54,439,517 which Perenco shall pay to Ecuador.\n\n**6. Direction on Ecuador's use of the proceeds**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n900.\n\nPerenco argued that any damages awarded to Ecuador should not be used to offset the damages owed to Perenco. The Tribunal should instead order that Ecuador deposit that amount into a remediation fund that Ecuador must use solely for the purpose of remediating the Blocks.1095 This, according to Perenco, was the only way to ensure that the Tribunal's objective of protecting the environment was truly achieved and that Ecuador fulfilled its promises to use the funds to remediate, and that the entire counterclaims process is not subverted for Ecuador's opportunistic monetary gain.1096 Perenco noted that Ecuador had no objection to such an order and all that a remediation fund would do would be to hold it to its word.1097\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 75.\n\nPerenco's Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 75; Tr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 468.\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 470.\n\n901.\n\nOn this point, Ecuador's Attorney-General confirmed at the Expert Hearing Ecuador's prior statement during the earlier counterclaims phase that \"any damages that will be granted to Ecuador for the counterclaims would be devoted to the restoration of the ecosystems and Ecuador wouldn't have any problem whatsoever if the Tribunal felt an order to this point should be made, an order saying that any damages that would be granted to Ecuador shall be devoted to the full restoration of the ecosystems as provided for in the Constitution of Ecuador.\"1098\n\nTr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 375:2-13.\n\n902.\n\nThe Tribunal has reflected on the Parties' submissions. Insofar as Perenco's request for two separate awards of damages being made, one in favour of each Party, with the counterclaims damages to be paid into a remediation fund, the Tribunal observes that making an order that would require continued monitoring of Ecuador's remediation activities would be inconsistent with the Tribunal's role under the ICSID Convention. Subject only to the limited procedures contemplated in Articles 49-51 of the Convention, upon issuing its Award, the Tribunal is *functus officio*.\n\n903.\n\nThe Tribunal moreover believes that it is in both Parties' interests to bring this lengthy proceeding to an end and thereby allow both to move forward. For that reason, the Tribunal has decided to issue a single Award which specifies the damages owed by each Party to the other, together with awards of costs associated therewith.\n\n904.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal expresses its firm expectation, based on solemn representations made by both counsel for Ecuador and the Attorney General himself, which the Tribunal has accepted, that the proceeds of the damages award made in favour of Ecuador in the environmental counterclaim will be devoted to remediation of the Blocks. The State has made plain its interest in remediating the contamination caused by oilfield operations in the *Oriente* region of Ecuador. The Tribunal therefore states its clear expectation that the monies payable to Ecuador will be devoted to this important task and will not remain in the State's general revenues.\n\n**IV. DAMAGES CLAIMED IN RELATION TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE COUNTERCLAIM**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n905.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to consider the infrastructure counterclaim. A number of points need to be made in respect of this counterclaim:\n\n(a) Ecuador raised exactly the same infrastructure counterclaim in the *Burlington* arbitration as it has in this case against Perenco.1099\n\n(b) Both counterclaims are based on the alleged breaches of the identical provisions in the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 211100, and of Ecuadorian law.1101\n\n(c) As can be seen in Annex B to this Award, the witnesses in respect of both infrastructure counterclaims appear to be almost identical.\n\n(d) The *Burlington* tribunal held a site visit which this Tribunal did not.1102\n\n(e) The amount claimed in both counterclaims was virtually identical.1103\n\n(f) Having visited the premises and heard from witnesses, the *Burlington* tribunal awarded Ecuador the sum of US$2,577,119 itemized as follows:1104\n\n(i) US$503,572.76 for the Gacela T-104 and Payamino-tanks, as well as minor repairs to the pipelines;\n\n(ii) US$1,462,553.43 for repairs related to pipelines and fluid lines; and\n\n(iii) US$561,900 for Block 7 engines and US$49,093.58 for new vehicles.\n\n(g) The *Burlington* case has now been completed with an award of 7 February 2017.1105\n\n(h) Ecuador, while initially seeking annulment of the damages awarded against it in favour of Burlington and also of the decision on its environmental counter-claim, did not seek annulment of the damages awarded to it in respect of the infrastructure counterclaim.1106\n\n(i) Ecuador and Burlington thereafter entered into the Settlement Agreement pursuant to which the application for annulment of the *Burlington* award was withdrawn.1107\n\n(j) This Tribunal has already ruled that it will not dismiss the infrastructure counterclaim or the environmental counterclaim on the grounds of *res judicata*.1108\n\nSee Resp. PHB CC, paragraphs 118 & 122: Declaring \"that Claimant is liable towards Ecuador for the costs required to remedy the poor state of the infrastructure of Blocks 7 and 21 left behind by Perenco, given Claimant's breach of [the Contract and Ecuadorian law]\" and Ordering \"Claimant to pay damages for its failure to return the Blocks' infrastructure in good condition to Ecuador, in an amount quantified at US$17,231,458.85.\" c.f. *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 53: Declaring \"(ii) That Burlington is liable towards Ecuador for the costs required to remedy the poor state of the infrastructure of Blocks 7 and 21 left behind by Burlington\" and Ordering \"(iv) Burlington to pay damages for its failure to return the Blocks' infrastructure in good condition to Ecuador in an amount quantified at US$17,417,765.42 with interest at an adequate commercial interest rate from the date of disbursement thereof until the date of the Award.\"\n\nSee paragraphs 892 & 908 of *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, where both Ecuador and Burlington refer to Clause 5.1.8 of the Block 7 PSC and to Clause 5.1.7 of the Block 21 PSC.\n\nSee Resp. PHB CC, paragraph 102: \"Perenco's low-cost operations breached Articles 5.1.7 and 5.1.8 of Block 7 and 21 [Participation Contracts] which required it to use equipment and technology in accordance with the best standards and practices of the international oil industry. Regardless of whether Perenco's no-investment policy was in breach of its contractual obligations, the Hearing confirmed that Perenco returned the Blocks' infrastructure to Ecuador in appalling condition exceeding normal wear and tear in breach of the 'obligation de r\u00e9sultat' in Articles 5.1.22 and 18.6 of Block 7 [Participation Contract] (Articles 5.1.21 and 18.6 of Block 21 [Participation Contract]) and Article 29 of the [Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law No. 2967] \u2026\" c.f. *Burlington*, Decision on Counterclaims, paragraphs 891-892: \"Ecuador argues that, under both the PSCs and Ecuadorian law, the Consortium was under a dual obligation (i) to construct, maintain and replace the infrastructure on Blocks 7 and 21 in accordance with industry standards and (ii) upon contract termination, to return the Blocks to the State in good working condition. According to Ecuador, the Consortium breached both obligations and Burlington is accordingly liable for the remedial costs\" and \"Ecuador contends that \u2026 Article 29 of the Hydrocarbons Law, incorporated by reference in the PSCs, also provides for an obligation to turn over the infrastructure to the State 'in good condition'.\"\n\nSee *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraphs 18-27.\n\nSee note 1099 above.\n\nSee *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 1074.\n\n*Burlington* award.\n\nEcuador's Application for Annulment dated 13 February 2017, E-426, paragraph 64, setting out the specific grounds for Ecuador's Annulment Application  \n\"*\u2026 with respect to Ecuador's claims, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state its reasons when it decided that the strict liability regime of the 2008 Constitution has no retroactive effect \u2026, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state its reasons when it decided that the relevant permissible limits are not those applicable to sensitive ecosystems\u2026, the Tribunal failed to state its reasons for failing to perform vertical delineation\u2026, and the Tribunal exceeded its powers and failed to state its reasons upon which its consecutive findings are made when it decided on the apportionment of liability between Burlington and others*.\"\n\nCA-CC-121, *Burlington* Order of the Secretary-General Taking Note of the Discontinuance of the Proceeding.\n\nDecision on Perenco's First Dismissal Application, paragraphs 47-51.\n\n906.\n\nAccordingly, this Tribunal will have to consider the infrastructure claim, but must take into account that another tribunal has already ruled on it and awarded damages in respect of it. That tribunal not only heard virtually the same evidence about the same breaches and considered the same allegations as to damage, but personally observed the climatic and other conditions when it conducted its site visit.1109\n\nSee paragraphs 905 1(b), 905 1(c), and 905 1(d) above.\n\n907.\n\nWhat is more, as noted above, Ecuador did not seek the annulment of the part of the *Burlington* award relating to infrastructure,1110 so it must be assumed for present purposes that it was content with such an award. Ecuador has rightly stated that it cannot benefit from double recovery, so in many respects this Tribunal's task is largely duplicative.1111\n\nSee paragraph 905 1(h) above.\n\nSee Response, paragraph 110: \"Ecuador has always agreed to avoid double recovery in relation to its counterclaims, as stated in numerous occasions throughout both this and the Burlington arbitration. Ecuador's latest undertaking was made in the context of the Burlington Settlement, whereby it accepted that '*Ecuador no tiene derecho a recibir y no procurar\u00e1 una doble compensaci\u00f3n en relaci\u00f3n con los mismos montos y da\u00f1os ambientales y de infraestructura, constantes en la Decisi\u00f3n sobre las Reconvenciones en contra de Burlington* '.\" See also fn. 158: \"Hearing on Counterclaims, Transcript (ENG), D8:P2426:L12-P2428:L8 (Arbitrator Kaplan, Silva Romero) (\"ARBITRATOR KAPLAN: So if [Ecuador] were to recover something in this one less than your full claim, then you would seek the balance in the other one; is that right? MR. SILVA ROMERO: I think we have the duty to inform the Burlington Tribunal about the damages we would obtain in the Perenco Tribunal, indeed. Yes, sir.\"); Burlington 2014 Hearing on Counterclaims, Transcript (ENG), D7:P2341:L13-1 (Opening, Silva Romero) (\"The second comment I am specifically instructed to make *today is that we don't want the Burlington Tribunal to have any concern regarding double recovery. This is not what Ecuador is looking for. Ecuador is simply looking for the restoration of the ecosystems in Blocks 7 and 21*\", **E-440**. See also, *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, \u00b6 70, **CA-CC-59**.\"\n\n908.\n\nIt is necessary at the outset to pay careful regard to what the *Burlington* tribunal said in paragraphs 1080 to 1086 of its Decision on Counterclaims which are set out below:1112\n\n\"1080. As a final matter, the Tribunal must address the issue of double recovery. As mentioned in paragraph 70 above, Burlington has called the Tribunal's attention to the potential risk of double recovery in respect to the Respondent's counterclaims since Ecuador \"made a full claim for the alleged environmental harm in each of the Burlington and Perenco cases.\" Burlington requests that the Tribunal address the \"potentially pernicious consequences\" deriving from that risk so that \"if the dispositive part of either of the Awards on counterclaims provides for any compensation, Ecuador would be prevented from enforcing the second award for the extent that it has already been compensated by the first\".\n\n1081. The Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties on the issue of double recovery. More specifically, first, there is no question that Ecuador claims compensation for the same damages in these and in the parallel *Perenco* proceedings. For Burlington, Ecuador is \"twice seeking 100% recovery of precisely the same alleged damages for precisely the same alleged injury on precisely the same legal and factual bases.\" Ecuador, for its part, does not deny that it seeks compensation for the same harm in both cases, although it distinguishes the two arbitrations in various ways, stating for instance that the arguments or the evidence in both cases are not \"exactly the same\". Ecuador actually relies on the joint and several liability of the Consortium partners to justify its claim against Burlington although only Perenco operated the blocks.\n\n1082. Second, it is also common ground that claiming compensation for the same damage in parallel proceedings creates a risk of double recovery. In this context, Ecuador submits that whichever Tribunal issues the later award on Ecuador's counterclaims can readily address the risk and thus Burlington's fear of \"pernicious consequences\" is misplaced:\n\n\"Ecuador \u2026 adds that its counterclaims will not result in '*pernicious consequences* '. If Claimant alludes to the issue of double recovery, the prohibition thereof exclusively applies when a party has already been indemnified by a third party. In addition, Claimant cannot pretend to ignore that any second award in the present cases against the Consortium members *'could be fashioned in such a way as to prevent double recovery'*. International law, Ecuadorian law and international decisions offer numerous mechanisms for preventing double recovery, including by taking into account the monetary relief granted by any prior award\".\n\n1083. Third, there is common ground between the Parties that a creditor can only be compensated once for a given harm, and rightly so, as a number of arbitral tribunals have acknowledged that the \"prohibition of double recovery for the same loss is a well-established principle.\"\n\n1084. Fourth, the Tribunal takes note that, prior to the end of the Hearing on counterclaims, counsel for Ecuador clearly stated that Ecuador does not seek double recovery in its claims against the Consortium members:\n\n\"The second comment I am specifically instructed to make today is that we don't want the Burlington tribunal to have any concern regarding double recovery. That is not what Ecuador is looking for.\"\n\n1085. The Tribunal takes due notice of Ecuador's representations, which are in line with the general principle prohibiting double recovery.\n\n1086. As of the date of the present Decision, the *Perenco* tribunal has issued no decision yet on the counterclaims before it. Therefore, this Tribunal lacks the necessary information or basis to adopt any specific measures \u2013 *to fashion its decision*, to borrow Ecuador's phrase \u2013 to prevent double recovery, a task that it must leave to the Perenco Tribunal as the one deciding in second place. This being said, this Tribunal nonetheless states that as a matter of principle, the present Decision cannot serve and may not be used to compensate Ecuador twice for the same damage.\" (Emphasis on the original)\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims [footnotes omitted].\n\n909.\n\nNevertheless, consistent with the Tribunal's independent duty to consider the case presented to it, the Tribunal will briefly explain its views.\n\n910.\n\nThe Tribunal bases its determination of the counterclaim on two major considerations.\n\n911.\n\nThe first is that it is satisfied that in the declining years of the Blocks Perenco would, on the balance of probabilities, have been less concerned about maintaining the facilities than hitherto.1113 Accordingly, it would not surprise the Tribunal that there were in fact some breaches of the obligations in the PSCs set out below.\n\nSee also paragraph 252 above: \"*In the Tribunal's view, it is a given that the Consortium's thinking would have been dominated by the looming contract expiry. The Tribunal believes that the sharply rising price of oil leading up to October 2007 would have induced Perenco to seek to drill as many wells as were economically possible in the Oso field in the time remaining in that Contract. According to Mr. Crick, in the absence of a contract extension, Perenco would have stopped drilling in Block 7 in August of 2009 in order to ensure an adequate payback on the new wells. Mr. Crick estimates that Perenco could have drilled 24 wells per year in Block 7. The Tribunal agrees and accepts Mr. Crick's production profiles.*\"\n\n912.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal is conscious of the challenging conditions of operating in the Amazon rainforest and the predisposition towards rust and corrosion in that climate.1114 The Tribunal is also conscious that the Blocks had been operated both before and after Perenco's tenure of the Blocks.1115\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 408.\n\nThe comments made with respect to Ecuador's claim for environmental damages are likewise applicable to the infrastructure claim. See Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraphs 490, 589, 591, 597 and 598.\n\nA. **Legal Position**\n---------------------\n\n913.\n\nIt is not disputed that certain clauses of the PSCs cover the Consortium's obligations with respect to the infrastructure of the Blocks not only during the operation of Blocks 7 and 21, but also upon the termination of the PSCs.1116\n\nSee Ecuador's Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims, paragraphs 916, 918-919, referring to Clauses 5.1.7 and 5.1.21 of the Block 21 Participation Contract and Clauses 5.1.8 and 5.1.22 of the Block 7 Participation Contract as well as Clauses 18.6 of the two Participation Contracts and Article 29 of the Hydrocarbons Law, incorporated by reference into the Participation Contracts. *C.f.* Perenco's Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims, paragraphs 516 and 524-525, referring to the same clauses and provision.\n\n914.\n\nClause 5.1.8 of the PSC for Block 7 and clause 5.1.7 of the PSC for Block 21 required the Consortium to use qualified personnel and suitable equipment and technology during the operation of the blocks.\n\n915.\n\nClause 5.1.8 reads as follows:1117\n\n\"5.1 Obligations of the Contractor:...\n\n\u2026\n\n5.1.8 Employ qualified personnel, as well as equipment, machinery, materials and technology, in accordance with the generally accepted norms and practices of the international petroleum industry.\"\n\nCE-CC-028.\n\n916.\n\nClause 5.1.7 similarly provides:1118\n\n\"5.1 Obligations of the Contractor: \u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n5.1.7 To use personnel, equipment, machinery, materials, and technology in accordance with the best standards and practices generally accepted in the international hydrocarbon industry.\"\n\nCE-CC-013.\n\n917.\n\nUpon termination of the PSCs, clauses 5.1.22 and 18.6 of the PSC for Block 7 and clauses 5.1.21 and 18.6 of the PSC for Block 21, provide that the Consortium shall return the wells together with all equipment, tools, machinery, installations (acquired for and during the term of the PSCs) to Petroecuador in good condition except for normal wear and tear, and at no cost. These provisions provide precisely as follows:\n\nBlock 7 PSC1119\n\n\"5.1.22 Upon termination of this Contract, deliver the wells, property, installations, equipment and infrastructure works related to this Contract to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good condition, in accordance with the provisions of Article twenty-nine (29) of the Hydrocarbons Law.\"\n\n\"**18.6** Upon the term of this Contract, either due to expiration of the Exploitation Period or for any other reason during the same Period, the Contractor shall deliver to PETROECUADOR, withouth cost and in good condition, the wells which were in production and, in good condition except for normal wear, all equipment, tools, machinery, installations and other items which were acquired for purposes of this Contract.\"\n\nBlock 21 PSC1120\n\n\"**5.1.21** Upon termination of the Contract, the Contractor shall deliver to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good condition, the wells, property, facilities, and equipment that were required for the purpose of the Contract in accordance with article 29 of the Law on Hydrocarbons.\"\n\n\"**18.6** Upon termination of this Contract at the end of the Exploitation Period or for any other cause occurring during the same Period, the Contractor shall deliver to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good production conditions, the wells that are active at such time as well as, in good condition except for normal wear and tear, all other equipment, tools, machinery, facilities, and other movable and immovable property acquired for the purposes of this Contract.\"\n\nCE-CC-028.\n\nCE-CC-013.\n\n918.\n\nIt is also necessary to refer to Article 29 of the Hydrocarbon Law noted above which states:\n\n\"[U]pon termination of an exploration and exploitation contract, due to expiration of its term or for any other reason arising during the exploitation period, the contractor or associate must turn over to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in a good state of production, the oil wells that are in activity at the time; as well as, in good condition, all equipment, tools, machinery, installations, and other real or personal property that were acquired to fulfil the contract's purposes [\u2026].\"1121\n\nEL-90 (Unofficial translation from the Spanish original).\n\n919.\n\nWith regard to the obligation to comply with the generally accepted international petroleum industry's practices, it is important to note that Article 10 of RAOHE provides that the contractor \"*shall apply, at least*\" the API standard \"*and any other rule or standard of the petroleum industry.*\"1122\n\n\"**Norms and Standards** :  \nIn hydrocarbon operations, PETROECUADOR and contractor shall apply, at least, the practices recommended by the American Petroleum Institute \"API\" particularly the following: \"Exploration and Production standards\" and \"Manual of Petroleum Measurement standards\" and any other rule or standard of the petroleum industry.\"\n\nEL-148.\n\n920.\n\nFurthermore, RAOHE does provide for specific standards in relation to infrastructure and contains several references to the API standards. It is not disputed between the Parties that the API standards combine preventative as well as predictive maintenance techniques.1123\n\nPerenco's Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims, paras 519-521 *c.f.* Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, paragraph 456.\n\n921.\n\nAs the *Burlington* tribunal noted, and as has occurred in the present case, both Parties challenge the credibility or relevance of each other's witnesses and experts. The Tribunal bears in mind that the witnesses gave evidence relating to matters occurring some years previously and in those circumstances, just like the *Burlington* tribunal,1124 the Tribunal places more reliance on contemporary documents which may assist regarding the determination of the state of the infrastructure as of the date of takeover.\n\nSee *e.g. Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraphs 933-936.\n\n922.\n\nAn important part of Perenco's defence to the infrastructure counterclaim was its reliance on two contemporaneous reports prepared by SGS in 2009 and 2010 (\"**SGS Reports**\").1125 Both of these reports assess the condition of the infrastructure, which included the equipment facilities and other assets of both Blocks 7 and 21 according to five categories ranging from very good to very bad. These reports concluded that the significant majority of the infrastructure is considered to be in good or very good condition. This report seems to tie up with Ecuador's claim for compensation in *Burlington* with respect to only 3 tanks (out of 89) and 3 pumps (out of 16).1126\n\nCE-CC-217; CE-CC-240.\n\nEcuador withdrew its claim for the purchase of 5 power oil pumps as those had not been acquired yet, see Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, para 519.  \nSee CE-CC-348 (total number of tanks). Regarding Ecuador's claim with respect to tanks in the present case, see Montenegro WSI, para 23, bullet point 6: only tank repaired was the Payamino T-102 tank; Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, paras 521, 529: T-104 tank of Gacela CPF has been repaired, and emergency repairs carried out Payamino T-102 tank and the Yuralpa T-400 tank.  \nThe Tribunal notes that Ecuador in its Resp. PHB CC, paragraph 112 seeks to explain that it is complaining that \"*at least 12 tanks were returned in poor condition* \u2026*, not 3 as wrongly alleged by Perenco*.\"   \nRegarding its claim with respect to pumps, see CE-CC-217, Amortizables B7 and Amortizables B21 (total number of pumps). Ecuador's claim is for (i) a new transfer and horizontal multistage pumps in the Oso and Gacela fields (Montenegro WSII, Annex 3, p. 4); (ii) repairs to two power oil pumps in the Coca field (Luna WS III, para 153; Luna WS III, Annexes 77-78; Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, paragraph 519).\n\n923.\n\nIt is true that Ecuador invites the Tribunal to place little reliance on the SGS Reports on the grounds that they are no more than inventories of assets.1127 The Tribunal disagrees as it places considerable reliance on the SGS Reports, especially where other evidence is lacking.\n\nSee Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, paragraphs 489, 491, 496. See also Luna WS III, paragraph 69.\n\n924.\n\nAnother important point to bear in mind as mentioned earlier, is that Petroamazonas expanded its operations and increased drilling and production on both Blocks from at least January 2010 onwards.1128 As the *Burlington* tribunal remarked, and with which this Tribunal agrees, \"*this expansion and increase in production would entail a need to improve the existing infrastructure.*\"1129 Ecuador has submitted before both tribunals that none of the amounts it is claiming is associated with the expansion of production in the Blocks. However, one thing is clear and that is that evidence of Petroamazonas' expansion activities do make it difficult to establish the facts as they were when the Consortium left the Blocks. The Tribunal needs to keep this in mind throughout.\n\nSee Perenco's Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims, *e.g.* paragraphs 31, 376, 512 describing costs being claimed that are allegedly associated with Ecuador/Petroamazonas' expansion of the Blocks *c.f.* Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, Section 4.4.3, denying that it has included the costs associated with Petroamazonas' expansion of Block 7 but not denying that there are current plans for expansion in Block 7.\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 937.\n\n925.\n\nAt the end of the hearing on the counterclaims and after closing submissions thereon, the Tribunal, after careful deliberation, formed the view that Ecuador's claims in relation to the infrastructure counterclaim were excessive in value. The Tribunal formed the view that there were some breaches of the obligations, which sounded in damages, but in the light of all the evidence presented, the Tribunal was of the view that the damages were in the region of approximately US$2 million.\n\n926.\n\nThe Tribunal has read the *Burlington* award and finds itself in general agreement with the items of breach found by that tribunal regarding the infrastructure counterclaim. The *Burlington* tribunal considered the various items of that counterclaim in great detail and as their conclusions to a great extent accord with this Tribunal's view of the matter, no useful purpose can be served by a detailed recitation of evidence (virtually identical in both cases) and of the arguments relating to each head of claim. However, the Tribunal will set out briefly its reasoning and conclusions with regard to the disputed items.\n\nB. **Tanks**\n------------\n\n927.\n\nEcuador contends that the Consortium's practices of purchasing storage tanks which were substandard and of recycled parts of old tanks from several fields to build \"*new*\" tanks was not in line with international standards and requirements.1130 Like the *Burlington* tribunal, this Tribunal is not satisfied that Ecuador has substantiated that the Consortium failed to construct or maintain tanks in accordance with industry standards and practices.\n\nEcuador's Reply on Counterclaims, paragraphs 500 and 501.\n\n928.\n\nThis Tribunal too relies upon the evidence of Dr. Egan that all the tanks were manufactured in accordance with API 650.1131 There is evidence that the tanks were regularly inspected and records kept,1132 that there was monitoring of corrosion of the tanks according to API 653, that there was an effective cathodic protection programme in place,1133 that plans had been devised to repair the large tanks in the blocks and that the Consortium kept Ecuador apprised of tank repairs.1134 This Tribunal also agrees that the fact that Ecuador limits its comments to a small percentage of the tanks and claims damages with respect to only 12 of them, is some indication that the Consortium's maintenance plan was, on the whole, adequate.\n\nIntertek I, paragraph 107.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 117.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 116.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 119, referring to CE-CC-087, pp. 3-5.\n\n929.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes Dr. Egan's point that inspections were carried out by Petroamazonas between one and three years after the takeover of the Blocks and that the type of corrosion identified by Petroamazonas was one that could occur quite quickly.1135 This conclusion leads to some doubt as to whether the corrosion found was in fact due to insufficient maintenance by the Consortium and the Tribunal bears in mind that the burden of proof is on Ecuador. The Tribunal cannot be satisfied that the damage to the tanks, the subject of complaint, was caused by the Consortium's operations. It seems to the Tribunal more likely than not, that the tanks' condition deteriorated since Petroamazonas took control of the Blocks and this negates any liability on the part of the consortium. Accordingly, the Tribunal too is satisfied that Ecuador has not established that the Consortium breached its obligations to construct and maintain tanks according to industry standards.\n\nIntertek II, paragraphs 79-81, referring to Luna WS III, paragraph 65, discussing \"*homogenous*\" and \"*localized*\" types of corrosion.\n\n930.\n\nFurther, in addition to constructing and maintaining the tanks Ecuador alleges that the Consortium returned certain tanks in a condition that is not consistent with normal wear and tear.1136 In its Post-Hearing Brief, Ecuador states that it seeks damages in relation to \"at least 12 tanks [that were] returned in poor condition \u2026, not 3 as wrongly alleged by Perenco.\"1137 The Tribunal has reviewed the record and while, as noted above, Ecuador did comment on the alleged poor condition of 12 tanks, it has only provided details about the repairs works and costs for three specific tanks and so the Tribunal will briefly consider these three.\n\nSee generally Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, Section 4.3.2.1.\n\nResp. PHB CC, paragraph 112.\n\n**1. Gacela T-104 Tank**\n------------------------\n\n931.\n\nThe documents provided show that this tank was inspected in 2010, 2011 and 2012.1138 An inspection in December 2010 discovered some problems with the roof and found a high level of oxidation.1139 The 2011 inspection showed that the corrosive processes had worsened and it was concluded that a \"*complete replacement*\" of the roof was \"*required*.\"1140\n\nLuna WS III, Annexes 55 to 57.\n\n*Ibid.*, Annex 55.\n\n*Ibid.,* Annex 56, pp. 6 and 7 (English translation).\n\n932.\n\nWhen it had been inspected in December 2008 and again in April 2009, just months before the Consortium suspended operations, the roof was still in sufficiently good condition.1141 Dr. Egan asserts that Ecuador failed to explain how the issues at the time of the inspections conducted between December 2010 and February 2012 were attributable to the Consortium. The issues complained of were only documented as \"*new situations*\" one and a half years later, in December 2010.1142 Dr. Egan also argued that it was entirely possible that the minimal corrosion identified in April 2009 rapidly progressed and became visible in December 2010; in fact, the December 2010 inspection indicated that the hole in the roof was \"*new*.\"1143\n\nCE-CC-164; CE-CC-341.\n\nIntertek II, paragraph 88, referring to Luna WS III, Annex 55.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 89.\n\n933.\n\nDr. Egan extrapolated from this that it was also in good condition in July 2009.1144\n\n*Ibid.*, paragraph 88.\n\n934.\n\nContrary to the *Burlington* tribunal's finding, this Tribunal was persuaded by Dr. Egan's analysis given the close timing of the April 2009 inspection. While there may have been some incipient corrosion, the bulk of it appears to have occurred after the Consortium left the Block. The Tribunal believes that it is far more likely than not that the cause of the corrosion found cannot be attributable to the Consortium's operations.\n\n935.\n\nThe Tribunal can see no reason why Ecuador should be reimbursed for the costs that it claims.\n\n**2. Payamino T-102 Tank**\n--------------------------\n\n936.\n\nEcuador contends that inspections of this tank took place between 2010 and 2011 and to establish this it has provided a contract signed between Petroamazonas and Conduto to perform the repairs on tank T102 \u2013 mainly involving cleaning and painting the tank, both internally and externally.1145 What is significant is that this document does not contain any description of the state of the tank at that time.\n\nMontenegro WS 3, Annex 5.\n\n937.\n\nThere is, however, documentary evidence prior to July 2009 which is contained in a document prepared by the Consortium in April 2008 in which it set out the basis for the bidding process to repair the Coca and Payamino tanks.1146 This document establishes that in March 2008 this tank required further inspection and repair, but was not in a critical condition at that time. The document stated that this tank should be cleaned and painted.1147 The Consortium did develop a project plan with a proposed start date in October 2009 with the duration of some two months to conduct the necessary repairs, but by that time the Consortium was no longer operating the Blocks.1148\n\nSol\u00eds WS 2, Annex 34.\n\nSol\u00eds WS2, Annex 34, pp. 15-17 in the English translation.\n\nIntertek ER II, paragraph 93, referring to CE-CC-343.\n\n938.\n\nHowever, the point remains that had the Consortium continued to operate the Blocks they would have incurred the expense for which it had planned and in those circumstances the Tribunal can see no reason why Perenco should not bear the cost of these repairs which it would have borne if events had taken a different course.\n\n939.\n\nEcuador has claimed US$322,960.42, which it has clarified to be on account of the emergency repairs carried out on several fluid lines and pipelines, the Payamino T-102 tank, the Yuralpa T-400 tank, the Jaguar and Yuralpa camps, *etc*.1149 The Tribunal agrees with the *Burlington* tribunal that Ecuador has not fully justified the claims for other repairs and improvements which are set out in Annex 3 to Mr. Montenegro's 2nd Witness Statement. The Tribunal further agrees with the *Burlington* tribunal that the amount recoverable under this head of claim should be reduced to US$210,130.76 which is the sum referable for the repairs made to this tank and pipelines.1150\n\nEcuador's Reply on Counterclaims, paragraph 529.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the *Burlington* tribunal subtracted all items that manifestly do not relate to repairs done to Payamino Tank T-102 or pipelines, such as, inter alia, improvements done to the Jaguar camp's dining room and kitchen, or replacement of floors in the Yuralpa offices. (see fn. 1982 of Counterclaims Decision). The Tribunal agrees with this approach.\n\n**3. Yuralpa T-400 Tank**\n-------------------------\n\n940.\n\nIn July 2009, the SGS Report described the condition of this tank as good or very good.1151\n\nCE-CC-217\n\n941.\n\nIn relation to this tank, two inspections were carried out in March 2011. The first inspection suggested substantial repairs to the interior of the tank and identified certain problems which did not pose an immediate risk to the mechanical construction and integrity of the tank.1152 The second report found that there was no evidence of any problems that might put the mechanical construction and integrity at risk.1153 It is also fair to point out that all references to this tank in the SGS Reports indicate that the tanks were in good or very good condition.1154\n\nLuna WS III, Annex 52.\n\n*Ibid.,* Annex 53.\n\nCE-CC-217, SGS inventories of Blocks 7 and 21, July 2009.\n\n942.\n\nHowever, the biggest problem is that the first inspection which identified a defective condition of this tank dates from March 2011 which is some two years after the Consortium had ceased operations. Bearing in mind that the SGS Report in June 2009 describes the condition of the components of this tank in favourable terms, the Tribunal considers that Ecuador has failed to establish that any damage to this equipment and costs incurred relating to the condition of this equipment were caused by the Consortium. Consequently, this claim is dismissed.\n\nC. **Claims relating to fluid lines and pipelines**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n943.\n\nThe *Burlington* tribunal addressed this matter in great detail between paragraphs 965 and 1006 of its Decision on Counterclaims. This Tribunal has considered these paragraphs carefully and has considered all the documents referred to therein, which were also submitted in this proceeding. This Tribunal agrees with the discussion and analysis conducted by the *Burlington* tribunal and can see no useful purpose in setting out this somewhat technical matter all over again.\n\n944.\n\nThe claim under this head is US$1,667,655.83. This is based on Mr. Luna's evidence, but the Tribunal notes, as did the *Burlington* tribunal, that in his last witness statement he assessed this claim at US$1,462,553.43 broken down in five component parts set out in paragraph 1005 of the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims.1155 Bearing in mind that Ecuador is not seeking the replacement of the pipeline system, but has limited its claims to the cost of two inspections and urgent and necessary repairs as set out in the paragraph just referred to, this Tribunal agrees that Ecuador should be compensated in the sum of US$1,462,553.43.\n\nSee Luna WS III, paragraphs 163-169.\n\nD. **Claims related to generator engines**\n------------------------------------------\n\n945.\n\nThis claim relates to various power generator engines in Blocks 7 and 21 which, it is alleged, were in a very bad state when the Consortium abandoned the blocks. Ecuador's claim focuses on Wartsila engines 2, 3 and 4 in Block 21 and on all 27 Caterpillar engines in Block 7. Ecuador's allegation is that the Consortium failed to conduct proper overhauls of these machines and further that it used harmful crude-diesel fuel mix in the Block 7 engines which caused damage to them. The claim here is based on the costs of overhauls, reduced engine life and the purchase of a new alternator for Wartsila engine 4. The total cost claimed hereunder is US$6,540,010.57 of which US$4,744,733.75 relates to Block 21 and US$1,795,276.18 relates to Block 7.\n\n946.\n\nAs to the claim in relation to overhauls it is not in dispute that engines require preventative maintenance which includes monitoring, testing and overhauls. However, having considered the evidence and in particular Mr. Luna's witness statements and Dr. Egan's expert report as well as the Consortium's maintenance records, this Tribunal agrees with the *Burlington* tribunal's reasoning - as set out between paragraphs 1021 and 1026 of the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims-, that Ecuador has failed to provide sufficient evidence of any alleged failure to perform timely overhauls to its generator engines or to prove that such failure increased the maintenance costs or reduced the useful life of the engines. Consequently, this claim is denied.\n\n947.\n\nEcuador also contends that damage was caused by the use of a crude-diesel fuel blend. This apparently was a cheaper diesel crude mix and Ecuador submits that the effect of this mix was disastrous on the engines. There is no dispute that the Consortium did use a crude-diesel fuel blend in Block 7, but Perenco contends that this was not an unreasonable choice and it was one which had government approval and, in any event, had no lasting impact on the engines.1156\n\nPerenco's Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims, paragraphs 567-572.\n\n948.\n\nIt is not contested that the Consortium decided to stop using this blend after approximately seven months. Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9 claimed that this was due to cost issues, but the Tribunal is not satisfied that cost was the sole reason and is entitled to infer that this was due, at least in part, because the blend was not properly working.\n\n949.\n\nIt is true that the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum knew of the practice of using this blend and that there was no opposition to it.1157 Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the responsibility for the good condition of the equipment still lay with the Consortium. The documents provided to the Tribunal show that the use of the blend could lead to higher maintenance costs and affect engine life. Further, as has been stated, the Consortium itself discontinued the use of this blend.\n\nd'Argentr\u00e9's WS III, paragraph 59, referring to Exh CE-CC-146.\n\n950.\n\nFor the above reasons and for those also stated in the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims on this issue, the Tribunal is satisfied that the use of the blend did affect the condition of the engines.\n\n951.\n\nEcuador claims a total of US$1,795,276.80 in connection with engines in Block 7 with US$1,123,8001158 for the reduction in the engines' useful life, which Ecuador estimates to be a reduction of 30% in useful life,1159 due to a lack of regular maintenance and the use of the crude diesel blend. However, as this Tribunal has already rejected Ecuador's contention that the Consortium's alleged lack of regular maintenance reduced engine life and as Ecuador has not satisfactorily established what proportion of the reduction in useful life can be attributed to the use of the blend, the Tribunal is left in somewhat of a quandary. The *Burlington* tribunal, in the exercise of its discretionary powers in matters of quantifying damages, thought it appropriate to grant Ecuador half of the amount claimed for reduction of the useful life of Block 7 engines and thus granted a sum of US$561,900.1160 This Tribunal is not bound to exercise its discretion in exactly the same way but considers it to be a reasonable sum and will grant US$561,900 under this head of claim.\n\nEcuador's Supplemental Memorial on Counterclaims, paragraph 411.\n\nEcuador's Reply on Counterclaims, paragraph 526.\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 1039.\n\nE. **Claims related to pumps, electrical systems, IT equipment, and road maintenance**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Pumps**\n------------\n\n952.\n\nEcuador alleges that the Consortium operated with too few pumps, and that those that were used were obsolete, did no preventative or predicted maintenance, had no or not sufficient back-up systems and lacked the necessary stock of spare parts.1161 It alleges that when Petroamazonas took over the Blocks it had to purchase new pumps to replace the ones currently in place. However, there is no evidence that it ever replaced the pumps and at that time it had performed overhaul on pumps 2 and 4 of Coco CPF which it claimed costs of US$33,662.45.1162\n\nLuna WS III, paragraphs 123-129.\n\nSee Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, paragraph 519, referring to Luna WS III, Annex 78.\n\n953.\n\nThis claim is unsustainable because for some time after taking over the Blocks Ecuador was still operating the pumps that it now claims are obsolete but for two pumps in Coca CPF. In relation to these two pumps Ecuador did perform overhauls at the cost set out above which is claimed here. As the *Burlington* tribunal remarked, the fact that 158 of 160 pumps were present in the Blocks when control passed to Petroamazonas in July 2009 and had not been overhauled or replaced after the takeover led that tribunal to infer that these pumps were not in the dire condition that Ecuador alleges.1163 Having considered the matter afresh, this Tribunal agrees with the *Burlington* tribunal.\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 1044.\n\n954.\n\nAs for the two pumps which were overhauled, the report upon which Ecuador relies is dated September 2012, which was three years after Petroamazonas took over.1164 This is of no assistance to the Tribunal in assessing the state of the pumps in July 2009.\n\nLuna WS III, Annex 79.\n\n955.\n\nThis claim is dismissed.\n\n**2. Electrical systems**\n-------------------------\n\n956.\n\nSimilarly as the *Burlington* tribunal,1165 the Tribunal dismisses the claim on the grounds of absence of proof that the expenses related to the purchase of the new variators were caused by the Consortium's improper maintenance or by bad condition beyond normal wear of the electrical system of the Blocks in July 2009.\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraphs 1049-1051.\n\n**3. IT equipment and software**\n--------------------------------\n\n957.\n\nThe claim under this head is that the Consortium did not have proper maintenance software in accordance with industry standards. Accordingly, when Petroamazonas took over, it incurred costs in order to upgrade the technology used in its offices and implemented \"Maximo\" which was a new computerised maintenance management system (CMMS). Mr. Luna quantified this claim at US$151,601.96 which included the purchase of computers, cameras and the cost of hiring personnel to implement the system.1166 If one excludes the purchase of computers, Ecuador quantifies this claim at US $81,384.96.1167\n\nEcuador's Supplemental Memorial on Counterclaims, paragraph 414.\n\n*Id.*\n\n958.\n\nThis claim for US$151,601.96 is not sustainable. The Consortium had another management software in place, the SAP system, which was characterized by Dr. Egan as an \"*internationally recognized management system*\"1168 which is \"*comprehensive*\"1169 and complying with industry standards.\n\nIntertek ER I, paragraph 48.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 51.\n\n959.\n\nEcuador does not dispute this, but contends that the Consortium did not give nor offer access to the SAP maintenance data when it left the Blocks and thus Petroamazonas had to purchase the Maximo system from scratch.1170 While the *Burlington* tribunal placed reliance on a letter written by the Consortium to Petroamazonas on 23 July 2009 to \"*propose a technical meeting to ensure an orderly post-takeover transition*\"*,* the letter was in fact referring to the transition of employees and contractors and not specifically the system. In all the circumstances, the Tribunal awards the sum of US$81,384.96.\n\nLuna WS III, paragraph 45, responding to Mr. d'Argentr\u00e9's WS III, paragraph 36: \"*Ecuador omits the fact that the Consortium was willing to transfer all of its maintenance records in an orderly fashion.*\"\n\nF. **Road maintenance and vehicles**\n------------------------------------\n\n960.\n\nEcuador seeks to recover the amounts which it spent on the purchase of new vehicles (US$98,107.16) and road maintenance (US$381,127.64).1171 The Tribunal notes that Ecuador has not put forward any documentary evidence showing the need to repair or replace specific vehicles. However, it notes that the SGS Reports do identify two vehicles, both Toyota Land Cruisers, that were either in \"*very bad*\" or \"*good*\" but damaged condition.1172 The *Burlington* tribunal took the view that as Ecuador was claiming the cost of purchasing four similar vehicles for US$98,187.16, that tribunal should grant Ecuador half this claim, namely US$49,093.58. In this Tribunal's opinion, the fact that Ecuador has not put forward any documentary evidence supporting the need to repair or replace specific vehicles is sufficient for this claim to be dismissed. Accordingly, this Tribunal will not follow the *Burlington* tribunal which granted half the claim, namely, US$49,093.58.\n\nE-211.\n\nCE-CC-217, CE-CC-240.\n\n961.\n\nThe claim in respect of roads and road maintenance is dismissed for lack of proof that these expenses were caused by the Consortium's negligence.\n\nG. **Other claims**\n-------------------\n\n962.\n\nEcuador also seeks compensation for other repairs and the upgrade of facilities, the purchase of back-up equipment, spare parts and materials to bring the Blocks' operation into line with industry standards. These works include the reconditioning of wells, the refurbishment of camps and a new communication tower in Gacela CPF.1173\n\nSee *e.g.* Montenegro WS III, paragraph 7; see also E-211.\n\n963.\n\nThe Tribunal finds these claims have not been sufficiently particularised or proven by Ecuador. The Tribunal is satisfied that the infrastructure of the Blocks was generally in proper condition and that Ecuador's expansion plan and increases in production were likely to require improvements to existing equipment and facilities in any event. Accordingly, these additional claims are rejected.\n\nH. **Conclusion on the Damages Regarding the Infrastructure Counterclaim**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n964.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that it will grant a total of US$2,315,969.15 in respect of Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaims itemised as follows:\n\n(a) US$210,130.76 for the Payamino T-102 tank;\n\n(b) US$1,462,553.43 for repairs related to pipelines and fluid lines;\n\n(c) US$ 561,900 for generator engines; and\n\n(d) US$81,384.96 for IT equipment and software.\n\n965.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the issue of double recovery. There is no dispute between the Parties that Ecuador can only recover this sum or receive the benefit of it once.1174\n\nSee paragraph 907 above. Further, see generally Perenco's First and Second Dismissal Applications.\n\n966.\n\nAs Burlington and Ecuador have settled their differences by the payment in full of the *Burlington* award which included US$2,577,119 for Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaim (in other words, a deduction was made from Burlington's damages) it cannot be right for this Tribunal to award the same or part of the same sum twice. Therefore, consistent with the agreement of Ecuador not to seek double recovery, this Tribunal concludes that because the *Burlington* infrastructure damages are higher than the sum awarded by this Tribunal, Ecuador has been made whole on the infrastructure counterclaim, and this sum shall not be included as part of Ecuador's counterclaim damages.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n967.\n\nAs the procedural history of this arbitration shows clearly, these proceedings have been lengthy, complex, multi-faceted, hard fought and very expensive. The Parties filed their Submissions on Costs on 19 April 2019 and their Reply Submissions on Costs on 10 May 2019.\n\n968.\n\nPerenco claims the total sum of US$57,923,3321175 in respect of its legal costs and other expenses in this arbitration as set out in the Claimant's updated Schedule of Costs and Fees annexed to its 10 May 2019 Reply Submission on Costs.1176\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Phase** | **Legal Fees** | **Expert****Fees** | **Costs** | **Total** |\n| Request for Arbitration, Provisional Measures, Jurisdiction | $4,922,728 | $225,986 | $1,045,017 | $6,193,731 |\n| Liability, Motion for Reconsideration | $6,619,023 | $1,736,450 | $1,551,189 | $9,906,662 |\n| Quantum | $7,029,649 | $5,115,861 | $1,161,750 | $13,307,260 |\n| **Principal Claims** | **$18,571,400** | **$7,078,297** | **$3,757,956** | **$29,407,653** |\n| **Counterclaims** | **$11,881,356** | **$9,178,588** | **$3,005,809** | **$24,065,753** |\n\nThis amount excludes ICSID advance payments totalling US$4,799,900.00.\n\nPerenco in its Submission on Costs, dated 19 April 2019, originally claimed its total costs and fees of US$57,920,021.\n\n969.\n\nEcuador claims the total sum of US$31,620,369.271177 in respect of its legal costs and other expenses in this arbitration, and a total sum of US$49,629.76 in respect of Petroecuador's legal costs and other expenses in this arbitration. The detailed breakdown is set out in Annex A to its 19 April 2019 Costs Submission.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **PHASE** | **LEGAL FEES (INCLUDING PGE)** | **EXPERT FEES****AND COSTS** | **COSTS** | **TOTAL** |\n| *Request for Arbitration, Provisional Measures, Jurisdiction* | US$ 2,787,393.80 | US$ 33,237.91 | US$ 232,697.14 | US$ 3,053,328.85 |\n| *Liability, Motion for Reconsideration* | US$ 4,212,798.50 | US$ 1,058,867.79 | US$ 480,065.83 | US$ 5,751,732.12 |\n| *Quantum* | US$ 3,911,825.68 | US$ 3,672,886.85 | US$ 589,201.20 | US$ 8,173,913.73 |\n| **Principal Claims** | **US$ 10,912,017.98** | **US$ 4,764,992.55** | **US$ 1,301,964.17** | **US$ 16,978,974.70** |\n| **Counterclaims** | **US$ 5,284,433.84** | **US$ 3,859,326.13** | **US$ 991,719.98** | **US$ 10,135,479.95** |\n\nThis amount includes ICSID advance payments of US$4,500,000.00 and a PCA filing fee of US$5,914.62. It excludes Ecuador's final advance payment to ICSID of US$300,000 which was received after the submissions on costs. Ecuador has made ICSID advance payments totalling US$4,800,000.00.\n\n970.\n\nBoth sides claimed their costs on the assumption they will be the prevailing party.\n\n971.\n\nThe starting point of any consideration for costs is Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention which empowers the Tribunal to \"except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\" The Tribunal has had to consider not only Perenco's Treaty claims but also claims of both Parties under the Participation Contracts, Ecuador's claims being in the form of counterclaims.\n\n972.\n\nThe Participation Contracts provide that each Party shall incur the fees of the Arbitrator which they appointed, share half of the fees of the Presiding Arbitrator, and pay all the expenses incurred in the arbitration as determined by the Tribunal.\n\n973.\n\nIn its submissions, Perenco states that: \"The Blocks 7 and 21 Participation Contracts provide a method of allocating costs that, with some exceptions, is generally consistent with the default rule under the ICSID Convention by giving the Tribunal discretion of allocating costs, except for arbitrator fees and costs of ICSID facilities.\"1178 It however states that \"[t]he contract claims... added few incremental costs to the Treaty claim\" and that \"[i]t is therefore not sensible to allocate the arbitrators' fees... according to the Participation Contracts.\"1179 Ecuador agrees.1180 In light of the Parties' agreement, the Tribunal will not apply the Participation Contracts' approach to the allocation of arbitrators' fees.\n\nPerenco's Submission on Costs, paragraph 6.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nEcuador's Reply Submission on Costs, paragraph 2.\n\n974.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that tribunals usually take into account three factors in determining issues of costs.\n\ni. First, the parties' success on their respective claims or counterclaims;\n\nii. Second, their procedural conduct throughout the arbitration; and\n\niii. Third, the reasonableness of the costs actually claimed by them.\n\n975.\n\nIt is well established that arbitrators in ICSID cases have a wide discretion and there is no rebuttable assumption as there is in other rules that costs should follow the event.\n\n976.\n\nThere are a number of features in this case which, it is argued by one Party or the other, have had an impact on the costs of these proceedings and which the Tribunal should take into account. The Tribunal will consider each in turn and give its decision as to whether each has any merit and if so, whether it has a bearing on the award of the costs of these proceedings.\n\nA. **Ecuador declined to abide by the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n977.\n\nPerenco submits that Ecuador's decision not to abide by the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 8 May 2009, vastly altered the face of this arbitration and added to its complexity, length and expense.1181\n\nPerenco's Submission on Costs, paragraphs 3, 21-25.\n\n978.\n\nIn paragraph 695 of its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal noted that:\n\n\"The Tribunal recommended what it considered to be a reasonable way to protect both Parties' rights pending a final determination of their dispute. Regrettably, this was not possible in the circumstances. Perenco is correct to point out that had the State stayed its hand in relation to the *coactivas*, the dispute would not have been aggravated in the way in which it was.\"1182\n\nDecision on Liability, paragraph 695.\n\n979.\n\nNow that the case is at its end, the Tribunal, having reviewed the history of this dispute in the course of the final deliberations conducted in relation to the making of this Award, can go further. At the time when, despite the provisional measures, the Respondent threatened to proceed with the *coactivas*, the Tribunal made clear to Ecuador that the Tribunal \"*must necessarily take a serious view of any failure to comply\"*1183 with its provisional measures determination. The Tribunal had given careful consideration to a means that would allow the Parties to continue with the arbitration without threatening the underpinnings of their contractual relationship and aggravating their dispute. The escrow account, which Perenco proposed and the Tribunal considered could reasonably do the job of protecting the Respondent's fiscal interests, would have had all contested Law 42 dues paid into an account and made payable to Ecuador if it prevailed on the merits. Regrettably, Ecuador did not see fit to agree the escrow arrangement and instead commenced the *coactivas*.1184 This led to a series of events culminating in the total breakdown in the Parties' relationship.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 158, quoting from the Tribunal's letter of 27 February 2009 communicating its regret concerning the stance adopted by Ecuador with regard to Provisional Measures (Exhibit CE-204).\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 170.\n\n980.\n\nIrrespective of Ecuador's reasons for not complying with the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures, the fact of the matter is that its refusal changed the nature of this arbitration to the detriment of Perenco. Had Ecuador complied, this arbitration would likely have been quite different;\n\n(a) Perenco would likely still be operating both Blocks;\n\n(b) With no *coactivas*, there likely would have been no suspension of operations, and hence no declaration of *caducidad* ;\n\n(c) The right to operate Block 7 would likely have been extended in a new contractual form on mutually acceptable terms;\n\n(d) The Law 42 damages claim would have been relatively straightforward;\n\n(e) The accounting evidence would have been far more straightforward;\n\n(f) Both the liability and quantum phases would have been shorter and less expensive;\n\n(g) There might well not have been a counterclaim as the post-termination provisions of the Participation Contracts would not have been engaged; as the continuing operator, Perenco would have had a commercial incentive to re-invest in infrastructure maintenance and environmental protection; had it not done so, Ecuador had sufficient contractual and statutory remedies to enforce the same;\n\n(h) This arbitration would not have lasted 11 years;\n\n(i) There would have been no need for over 50 submissions and seven hearings; and\n\n(j) The total cost to both Parties would have been greatly reduced.\n\n981.\n\nIn the light of all of the above, the Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to take into account Ecuador's conduct in this arbitration when considering the overall issue of who should pay how much to whom.\n\nB. **Ecuador's objections to jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The joining of Petroecuador to the proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n982.\n\nPerenco instituted these proceedings not only against Ecuador but also against Petroecuador. However, the Tribunal found that it had no competence over Petroecuador.1185 Petroecuador claims as the reimbursement of the costs of its legal representation and expenses incurred US$49,629.76 in respect of this arbitration, with simple interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date they were incurred until payment.1186\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 242(3).\n\nEcuador's and Petroecuador's Submission on Costs, paragraphs 8 and 41(a).\n\n983.\n\nThis sum is reasonable to the Tribunal and it will accordingly order Perenco to pay Petroecuador US$49,629.76, together with simple interest at an annual rate of 3% which shall accrue from 30 June 2011 (the date of dispatch of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction), until the date of full and final payment.\n\n**2. Objections to jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n984.\n\nEcuador also raised objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear the claims. The Tribunal found it necessary to deal with the jurisdictional issues in two steps (issuing the Decision on Jurisdiction and then, after further evidence and submissions, the Decision on Liability). The Tribunal does not consider the objections to be frivolous and Ecuador's interest in having the Tribunal determine whether the principal claim could proceed was fully understandable. Nevertheless, ultimately Perenco prevailed on almost all jurisdictional issues except for the one relating to Petroecuador and the one relating to the claim regarding the declaration of *caducidad* in respect of Block 7 Contract. This will be taken into account in the award of costs.\n\nC. **Perenco received less than claimed**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n985.\n\nEcuador suggests that the Tribunal can take into account the fact that Perenco's claim was \"grossly inflated.\"1187 It is true that Perenco claimed US$1,423 billion (as of 18 April 2016, following some downward adjustments from US$1,698 billion) and ultimately was awarded US$448,820,400. The Tribunal notes that it is not uncommon for an award to be for a sum less than that claimed. The issue for the Tribunal is whether Perenco's claim was unreasonably inflated.\n\nEcuador's Reply Submission on Costs, paragraph 5.\n\n986.\n\nThe principal reason for the lower award of damages is that the Tribunal could not agree with Perenco's contention that the damages should be calculated on the basis that that the Block 7 Participation Contract would have been extended. The decision to award damages only for the loss of opportunity of that possible extension led to a significant reduction in the amount payable to Perenco.\n\n987.\n\nAs for the calculation of the damages prior to the declaration of *caducidad*, in the end, the Tribunal took a different approach from that suggested by Professor Kalt, but it did not conclude that his approach and analysis were frivolous. The Tribunal decided to adopt the 'layering' approach which led to a lesser sum. Professor Kalt's views were not absurd nor fanciful. The Tribunal simply decided that a different approach led to a more appropriate but still substantial figure for damages.\n\n988.\n\nFor its part, Ecuador's quantum experts were instructed to base their assessment of damages on certain assumptions (not accepted by the Tribunal) that, with certain notable exceptions (such as the 'layering' approach to valuing damages resulting from different breaches occurring at different times, the 'true-up' and the Waterfall Chart), prevented their written reports prepared during the quantum phase of the proceeding from truly assisting the Tribunal. Based on these instructions, Professor Dow and his team came up with the surprising result that Perenco suffered no loss and in fact was indebted to Ecuador. No disrespect is intended to Brattle by the making of this observation. The problem was that during the initial part of the quantum phase, Brattle acted on instructions which did not comport with the essential facts as found by the Tribunal, with predictable results in terms of the persuasiveness of their initial estimates of damages. In the end though, the Tribunal's view is that both Parties' experts provided helpful assistance to it.\n\n989.\n\nEcuador submitted a motion for reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Liability which was dismissed by the Tribunal1188 and Ecuador should bear Perenco's costs relating thereto. Perenco has not specified them separately but they have been included as part of the \"Costs on Liability and Motion for Reconsideration.\" They are included in the sum awarded by the Tribunal to Perenco for its costs relating to the principal claim.\n\nSee Decision on Reconsideration.\n\n990.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal believes that Perenco is entitled to reimbursement of its costs in successfully pursuing its claims against Ecuador. However, the Tribunal is of the view that the reimbursement should be reduced to a reasonable level of these costs, taking into account in particular that not all expert evidence assisted the Tribunal in reaching its decision. Therefore, out of total costs of US$29,407,653 that Perenco incurred in relation to its \"Principal Claims\", the Tribunal decides that Ecuador shall reimburse Perenco US$23 million.\n\nD. **Ecuador's counterclaims against Burlington and Perenco**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n991.\n\nBurlington and Perenco were the joint and several contractors for both Blocks 7 and 21. They were referred to as \"the Consortium\" and Perenco managed the Blocks on behalf of the Consortium.\n\n992.\n\nBoth Burlington and Perenco commenced treaty claims against Ecuador (under different treaties) and contract claims under the same Participation Contracts. Burlington's Request for Arbitration was dated 21 April 2008 and Perenco's was dated 30 April 2008. Burlington, however, withdrew its contract claims on 6 November 2009.1189\n\n*Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 June 2010, paragraphs 76-80.\n\n993.\n\nIn each of the arbitrations, Ecuador filed counterclaims seeking substantial compensation for environmental damage to parts of the Amazon rainforest affected by the works of, in effect, Perenco, as well as damages for the alleged failure to return the Blocks' infrastructure in reasonable condition as required by the Participation Contracts. Ecuador raised its counterclaims against Burlington on 17 January 2011 and then on 5 December 2011 raised the same counterclaims against Perenco.\n\n994.\n\nThe counterclaims raise three issues: (i) the question of duplication of proceedings; (ii) the initial estimation of the extent of the environmental damage; and (iii) the proportionality of what has actually been awarded to that which was initially claimed.\n\n**1. Duplication of proceedings**\n---------------------------------\n\n995.\n\nOn 24 June 2011, counsel for Perenco wrote to the Respondent's counsel suggesting that considerable sums could be saved by Ecuador if it maintained counterclaims just in the *Burlington* proceedings, and went on to suggest ways in which this could be achieved.\n\n996.\n\nOn 29 June 2011, the Respondent rejected this suggestion, relying on the fact that both Burlington and Perenco had thought fit to institute their own proceedings and thus two counterclaims was the consequence. Perenco accepted this position; it did not see fit to oppose the Perenco counterclaim on admissibility1190 or jurisdictional grounds and for some six years the Burlington and Perenco counterclaims proceeded along separate paths.\n\nThat is, at least up to two applications, dated 18 April 2017 and 30 January 2018, respectively, to dismiss the counterclaim on grounds of *res judicata.*\n\n997.\n\nThe issue thus arises whether Ecuador has unreasonably complicated these proceedings and thereby exacerbated the costs and delay by claiming the same damage from both Burlington and Perenco in two distinct arbitration proceedings. The counterclaim brought by Ecuador could have been maintained against Burlington alone or against Perenco alone. If the former, Perenco would be liable to compensate Burlington for 50% of any damages so proved as a joint and several co-contractor. If the latter, Burlington would be liable to compensate Perenco for 50% of any damages so proved as a joint and several co-contractor.\n\n998.\n\nHas Ecuador attempted to have two bites of the same cherry?\n\n999.\n\nThe costs of the *Burlington* counterclaim hearing were substantial and led to an award in Ecuador's favour in the sum of almost US$42 million against a stated claim of US$2,797,007,091.42.1191 The same claims were made against Perenco and, as will be seen above, has led to an Award in favour of Ecuador in the sum of US$93,683,890 from which the amount of US$39,199,373 awarded in the *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims and paid by Burlington, has to be deducted, so as to avoid double recovery.1192\n\n*Burlington* award, in particular the Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 52(iii), which is an integral part of the *Burlington* award.\n\nThe remaining sum awarded by the *Burlington* tribunal has been treated as negativing any further award of damages for the infrastructure counterclaim.\n\n1000.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal needs to decide whether the counterclaims against Perenco has added to the costs because it could have only been dealt with in the *Burlington* proceedings.\n\n1001.\n\nThere is no doubt that the launching of two counterclaims based on the same subject-matter was calculated to increase Ecuador's overall chances of success. But as the Tribunal observed earlier, parallel investment treaty arbitral proceedings brought by claimants (sometimes in tandem with commercial claims concerning the same facts) have been found not to be abusive even if there might be an element seeking two bites of the same cherry.1193\n\nThe *CME* and *Lauder* cases being a leading example.\n\n1002.\n\nIndeed, to the extent that the counterclaims issues were the same in the two proceedings, the real question is why Ecuador would counterclaim against Burlington at all, given that Perenco was the operator, the party with first-hand knowledge of the operations, and therefore the actual (as opposed to the nominal) author of some of the contamination that the Tribunal's Independent Expert has found in the oilfields.\n\n1003.\n\nIf Ecuador had acted with a view to seeking relief in the most efficient way, Burlington would have been spared the costs of defending itself against the claims made against the actions of the Consortium's operator. But that ultimately plays no role in the assessment of costs in this proceeding. For the reasons just stated, Ecuador logically should have proceeded against Perenco, not Burlington, and any costs thrown away in the *Burlington* arbitration are not relevant to assigning responsibility for costs in the present proceeding.\n\n1004.\n\nThe Tribunal has already held, by a majority, that under Ecuadorian and international law, Ecuador had a right to make counterclaims against both members of the Consortium and in its view, the exercise of that right by Ecuador was not abusive. This view was evidently shared by the *Burlington* tribunal, because it made no attempt to hold that its award on damages in favour of Ecuador had the effect of putting all extant counterclaims to an end. To the contrary, as already discussed, that tribunal left it to this Tribunal, as the later-in-time tribunal, to sort out the issue of double recovery.\n\n1005.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that launching the counterclaims in two proceedings was not necessary because as shown above it would have been possible to have them pursued just in one proceeding. But Ecuador stood on its rights, as it was entitled to do, and resisted Perenco's attempts to have the counterclaims consolidated.\n\n1006.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the maintenance of two counterclaims was an attempt (successful as it turned out) to have two bites at the cherry. It was an inefficient, costly and time-consuming way of obtaining a decision. But Ecuador had the right to commence two proceedings and no objection was taken by Perenco until it was far too late in the process.\n\n**2. The estimation of environmental damage**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1007.\n\nAs has been seen, the counterclaims against Perenco had a lengthy history. At the end of the hearing on the counterclaims, the Tribunal found that it was not prepared to accept the findings of either side's principal environmental experts and ordered an independent report by the Tribunal's Independent Expert, Mr. MacDonald, which led to an Award eventually in favour of Ecuador. Based upon the evidence then before it, the Tribunal believed that there would be contamination for which Perenco would be held liable1194, and the amount of damages awarded has turned out to be substantial.\n\nInterim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 582.\n\n1008.\n\nThe Tribunal has not lost sight of the fact that Perenco initially argued that the environmental counterclaims should be rejected \"in its entirety and \u2026 costs [awarded] in its favour... [together with] such other and further relief as the Tribunal deemed just and proper.\"1195\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 43.\n\n1009.\n\nAt the same time, also as anticipated by the Tribunal1196, the sum awarded by the Tribunal is nowhere near what Ecuador originally claimed in the proceeding (quantified at US$2,279,544,559 for soil clean-up costs, US$265,601,700 for groundwater remediation costs and US$3,380,000 for further groundwater studies (subject to payment of compound interest from the date of the Award until the date of full payment).1197\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 593.\n\n*Ibid.,* paragraph 36.\n\n1010.\n\nGiven that Ecuador's counterclaims were for a sum well in excess of US$2.5 billion, Perenco had to take this very seriously indeed. The environmental counterclaim was heralded by exaggerated allegations of an environmental catastrophe. It was based on criteria that were divorced from the actual Ecuadorian legislative framework and using inflated *ex* -country remedial costs.\n\n1011.\n\nAt the same time, Perenco did itself no favours by seeking the dismissal of the counterclaim \"*in its entirety*\" and acknowledging only in the most grudging manner a minor environmental liability. While Ecuador's experts could be accused of \"gold-bricking\" the claim, Perenco's experts could be accused of \"lead-bricking\" it, finding at every turn an opportunity to ignore or reduce potential liability.\n\n1012.\n\nIn short, neither side's principal environmental expert gained the confidence of the Tribunal.1198 For that reason, the Tribunal will direct that each side will bear the costs of its own environmental experts.\n\nWith the exception of Dr. Rouhani whose expert testimony the Tribunal found useful.\n\n1013.\n\nAt the end of the first counterclaims hearing, while it was not able fully to rely on Ecuador's evidence, the Tribunal considered that there was almost certainly some contamination for which Perenco would be responsible. Moreover, certain evidence of Perenco's own making was a matter of concern to the Tribunal.1199 For this reason, the Tribunal encouraged the Parties to settle the environmental counterclaim based on the findings of fact and law that it had made in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, while holding out the prospect that if they were unable to agree a settlement, an independent expert would be appointed. In the end, Ecuador benefited from this decision by being able to rely upon the Independent Expert's subsequent findings.1200\n\nThe May 2010 \"Jungal Memorandum\": prepared by Perenco regarding the characterisation of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8, when Perenco and a landowner but not the Ecuadorian authorities, had knowledge of the condition of a contaminated swampy area, and company officials debated what to do, being the leading example. The Interim Decision on Counterclaim, at paragraph 438, recounted the options set out in the memorandum:  \n438. The memorandum then set out \"possible solutions\" to the problem including, \"conventional remediation\" of the location, \"confine the problem and justify leaving the area as it is\", \"dismiss the issue\" (which it was noted could lead to a lawsuit and \"multimillion dollars compensation\" as well as lead the State to \"force us to remedy the site under their conditions\" in a situation where \"the cost will reach amounts very difficult to estimate now\" and \"the reputational cost to Perenco will also be very high\").  \nThe memorandum added: \"The State will probably assume that we are hiding many more [environmental] damages and will scrutinize the operations area in search for more damages and it will probably find them.\" Quoted in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, at paragraph 439.\n\nEven then, Ecuador persisted in characterising the situation in the Blocks as an environmental catastrophe, a characterisation which Perenco took exception to, and rightly so, in the Tribunal's view.\n\n1014.\n\nGiven that Ecuador ultimately prevailed on the environmental counterclaim, albeit with a much smaller award of damages than originally sought, it will be awarded a portion of its costs. The Award does not include Ecuador's expert fees and costs as its environmental expert reports did not assist the Tribunal in its task and it had to appoint the Independent Expert.\n\n**3. Disproportionality between what was claimed and what was awarded**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1015.\n\nThe *Burlington* tribunal awarded Ecuador the sum of US$41,776,492.77 in respect of its counterclaims.1201 This Tribunal has awarded US$93,683,890 for the environmental counterclaim (and has held that the *Burlington* tribunal's award of infrastructure damages has already fully compensated Ecuador). There is accordingly a substantial mismatch between the amount claimed by Ecuador and the amount actually recovered. In the Tribunal's view, the counterclaims were overstated, in particular the environmental counterclaim, which was based upon a number of incorrect assumptions. The Tribunal is satisfied that the huge amount claimed by Ecuador in its counterclaims has added substantially to the costs of these proceedings. As has been noted above, the counterclaims would likely not have been raised had the Decision on Provisional Measures been honoured by Ecuador.\n\nSee *Burlington* Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 1099.B.\n\n1016.\n\nPerenco's two Applications for Dismissal of Ecuador's Counterclaims failed1202 and there is no reason why Perenco should not bear the costs relating thereto. They have not been specified by Ecuador separately but rather included in its costs relating to counterclaims. They are part of the costs which Perenco has to reimburse Ecuador in connection with the counterclaims.\n\nSee Decision on Perenco's First Dismissal Application and this Award, paragraph 514, above.\n\n1017.\n\nIn view of the above considerations relating to the counterclaims and taking into account the outcome on the counterclaims reached, the Tribunal decides that Perenco shall reimburse Ecuador for the latter's costs incurred in relation to the counterclaims the amount of US$6,276,153.\n\nE. **Comments on Ecuador's costs submissions**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1018.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal was somewhat surprised by the nature, tone and content of Ecuador's submissions on costs. Their analysis of these proceedings is in the opinion of the Tribunal not realistic.\n\n1019.\n\nTo state that Ecuador is in effect the prevailing party in this arbitration is simply untenable. Ecuador's submission that it is in fact the successful party and indeed the injured party in these proceedings is not accepted given the Tribunal's previous findings on the overall outcome of the proceeding.\n\nF. **Costs of the Proceeding**\n------------------------------\n\n1020.\n\nThe costs of these proceedings, which have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties, are as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| (a) Arbitrators fees and expenses | US$ 2,720,449.19 |\n| (b) Environmental expert's fees and expenses1203 | US$5,205,011.95 |\n| (c) ICSID's administrative fees | US$324,000.00 |\n| (d) Direct expenses (estimated)1204 | US$1,254,592.59 |\n| **TOTAL** : | US$9,504,053.73 |\n\nThis amount includes the estimated cost of US$10,000 for the removal of the investigation derived waste. The final waste disposal costs will be calculated once all the waste is weighed and disposed of pursuant to Ecuadorian law. The Tribunal has directed the Independent Expert to finalise arrangements with its local subcontractor to urgently dispose of such waste.\n\nICSID will provide a detailed final statement of the case account to the Parties. The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n1021.\n\nThe Tribunal, taking into account that Perenco prevailed on its principal claim, while Ecuador was successful with its counterclaims, and in the exercise of its discretion, decides that the costs of the proceedings, including those of the Tribunal's Independent Expert, shall be borne equally by the Parties.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n1022.\n\nThe Tribunal incorporates by reference into this Award the Decision on Jurisdiction dated 30 June 2011, the Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability dated 12 September 2014, the Decision on Ecuador's Reconsideration Motion dated 10 April 2015, the Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim dated 11 August 2015, and the decisions on Perenco's two requests for dismissal of the Respondent's counterclaims dated 18 August 2017 and 30 July 2018.\n\n1023.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(a) For the breaches of its obligations under the Participation Contracts and the Treaty, the Republic of Ecuador shall pay to Perenco Ecuador Limited the amount of US$448,820,400.00, comprising the net present values as of 2007 and 2010 plus prejudgment interest to 27 September 2019. To that amount, post-award interest will accrue at a rate of LIBOR for three-month borrowing plus two percent, compounded annually. Post-award interest will accrue from 1 December 2019 until the date of full and final payment;\n\n(b) Perenco Ecuador Limited shall pay to the Republic of Ecuador the costs of restoring the environment in areas within Blocks 7 and 21 and remedying the infrastructure in these two Blocks in the amount of US$54,439,517.00. To that amount, post-award interest will accrue at a rate of LIBOR for three-month borrowing plus two percent, compounded annually. Post-award interest will accrue from 1 December 2019, until the date of full and final payment;\n\n(c) The Republic of Ecuador shall pay to Perenco Ecuador Limited the amount of US$23,000,000.00 as contribution to Claimant's legal fees and costs related to the principal claim, together with simple interest at an annual rate of three percent, which shall accrue from 1 December 2019 until the date of full and final payment;\n\n(d) Perenco Ecuador Limited shall pay to the Republic of Ecuador the amount of US$6,276,153.00 as contribution to Ecuador's legal fees and costs related to the counterclaims, together with simple interest at an annual rate of three percent, which shall accrue from 1 December 2019 until the date of full and final payment;\n\n(e) Perenco Ecuador Limited shall pay to Petroecuador the amount of US$49,629.76 in respect of the latter's legal fees and costs, together with simple interest at an annual rate of three percent which shall accrue from 30 June 2011 (the date of dispatch of the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction) until the date of full and final payment;\n\n(f) The ICSID costs (including the Tribunal's fees and expenses) shall be borne equally by both Parties;\n\n(g) The costs of the Tribunal's Independent Expert shall be borne equally by both Parties; and\n\n(f) All other claims of the Parties and requests for relief are dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2020-02-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn October 2, 2019, Ecuador presented an Application for Annulment (the \"**Application****for Annulment**\") of the Award dated September 27, 2019, issued in ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6 between Perenco Ecuador Limited and the Republic of Ecuador (the \"**Award**\"). Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, Respondent requested the ICSID Secretary-General to notify the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award until the *ad hoc* Committee rules on such request, and that the stay be maintained until a decision on the Application for Annulment is rendered by the Committee.1\n\nRespondent's Application for Annulment, October 2, 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 250-252.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter dated October 4, 2019, the Acting ICSID Secretary-General registered the Application for Annulment and notified the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n5.\n\nOn November 8, 2019, Perenco submitted its Opposition to Ecuador's Request to Continue the Provisional Stay of Enforcement, dated November 7, 2019 (\"**Claimant's Opposition to the Stay**\"), accompanied by Annex A (Decisions on Stays of Enforcement since November 2014).\n\n6.\n\nIn its Opposition to the Stay, the Claimant requested that the Committee lift the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award pending its decision on the Application for Annulment, or in the alternative, that the *ad hoc* Committee order Ecuador to provide, within 30 days of its decision on the issue of the stay, a deposit for the net amount of the Award, including accrued interest, into an escrow account; or an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or letter of credit for the net amount of the Award, including accrued interest.2\n\nClaimant's Opposition to the Stay, \u00b6 40; Claimant's Rejoinder to Ecuador's Request to Continue the Provisional Stay of Enforcement, December 18, 2019 (\"Claimant's Rejoinder on the Stay\"), \u00b6 107.\n\n7.\n\nOn November 18, 2019, the *ad hoc* Committee was constituted in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 6, 52(2), and 53. Its Members are: Professor Eduardo Zuleta (President), a national of Colombia; Professor Rolf Knieper, a national of Germany; and Professor M\u00f3nica Pinto, a national of Argentina (the \"**Committee**\"). Ms. Veronica Lavista, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Committee.\n\n8.\n\nIn separate communications dated November 19, 2019 and November 21, 2019, Respondent and Claimant respectively presented their comments regarding the schedule of submissions on the issue of the stay.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated November 25, 2019, the Committee fixed the schedule of written submissions regarding the issue of the stay. The timetable was set as follows: on or before December 6, 2019 Ecuador would file its reply to Perenco's opposition to the request for continuation of the stay; on or before December 18, 2019 Perenco would file its rejoinder on the request for continuation of the stay; and an oral hearing on the continuation of the stay would take place in Washington, D.C., which would be conducted together with the First Session of the annulment proceeding. In the same letter, the Committee decided to maintain the stay of enforcement until it issued its decision on the continuation of the stay.\n\n10.\n\nThe Parties presented their written submissions in accordance with the schedule set by the Committee. The oral hearing on the continuation of the stay took place on January 13, 2020 in Washington, D.C. The following persons were present at the hearing\n\n*Committee* :  \nProfessor Eduardo Zuleta President  \nProfessor Rolf Knieper Member  \nProfessor M\u00f3nica Pinto Member\n\n*ICSID Secretariat* :   \nMs. Veronica Lavista - Secretary of the Committee\n\n*For Perenco Ecuador Limited* :  \nCounsel  \nMr. Mark W.

The fact that certain arguments, documents, or legal authorities are not mentioned in the following sections does not mean that the Committee has not considered them.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimant' s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n13.\n\nClaimant requests that the Committee lift the stay of enforcement of the Award or, in the alternative, that it order Respondent to post a financial security as a condition for the continued stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n14.\n\nClaimant argues that a stay of enforcement is an exception to the binding and final nature of ICSID awards and thus Ecuador has the burden to justify the continuation of the stay.3 The wording of Articles 52(5) and 53(1) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules confirms the exceptional nature of a stay of enforcement. Accordingly, the applicant in ICSID annulment proceedings has neither a right nor a presumption in favour of continuation of the provisional stay.4 Recent practice of annulment committees confirms this interpretation of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules.5\n\nClaimant's Opposition to the Stay, \u00b6 4; Claimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19-21.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to the Stay, \u00b6 8.\n\n15.\n\nIn view of the exceptional nature of a stay of enforcement, the burden of proving that the circumstances require continuation is high. Ecuador must demonstrate that the circumstances at issue must be beyond the inherent or normal effects of an adverse ICSID award.6 Namely, when the respondent State is ravaged by war, is suffering an acute foreign exchange crisis, or when there is a risk of non-recoupment of the amounts paid to claimant individuals or corporations controlled by a single individual in case of annulment. In sum, circumstances requiring a stay must be severe.7\n\nClaimant's Opposition to the Stay, \u00b6 10; Claimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 42.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to the Stay, \u00b6 9; Claimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 46.\n\n16.\n\nClaimant argues that Ecuador has failed to show sufficiently severe circumstances requiring the continuation of a stay in the case at hand.8 Respondent contends that two specific circumstances justify the stay: (i) Ecuador's budgetary priorities and situation of social unrest; and (ii) the alleged risk of non-recoupment of the amounts paid under the Award if the Application for Annulment were to succeed. However, none of these circumstances are sufficiently severe to justify the stay.9\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 50.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 49.\n\n17.\n\nAs to the first circumstance, Claimant alleges that \"budgetary reallocation\" is an ordinary effect of having to comply with an ICSID award, not a circumstance requiring a stay.10 Claimant also rebuts on two grounds Ecuador's contention that payment of the Award would \"most likely ignite similar mass protests and strikes\": first, because the Award has nothing to do with the civil unrest caused by Ecuador's Government decision to cut fuel subsidies;11 and second, because social protests and discontent cannot constitute *carte blanche* to disregard international obligations.12\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 51.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 59-61.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 62.\n\n18.\n\nAs to the alleged risk of non-recoupment, Claimant states that there is no particular heightened risk of non-recoupment in the present case because Claimant is part of the larger oil multinational Perenco S.A., which makes this case completely different from cases involving individual natural persons with unclear assets.13 Nonetheless, Perenco undertakes to return any sums collected from Ecuador if the Committee upholds the Application for Annulment,14 and, if necessary, to procure a parent company guarantee from Perenco S.A.15\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 69.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 67.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 70.\n\n19.\n\nOn the other hand, Claimant notes that Ecuador's alleged \"compliance\" with ICSID decisions is misplaced. Post-award negotiations and settlements, including cuts in the amount awarded, do not correspond to the ordinary meaning of \"comply with the terms of the Award\" under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.16 Ecuador's track record of non-compliance with ICSID decisions weighs heavily against the stay. Except for one award of US$5.6 million, Ecuador has not paid promptly and in full any major adverse award.17 Moreover, in the *Perenco* and *Burlington* cases, Ecuador did not comply with the tribunals' orders of provisional measures.18\n\nClaimant's Opposition to the Stay, \u00b6 5; Claimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 77-79.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 24; Claimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 79.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 81.\n\n20.\n\nIn the alternative, Claimant argues that even if severe circumstances requiring a stay were to exist, the stay should be conditioned upon the posting of a security. Claimant contends that, pursuant to Articles 44 and 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Rules 19 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the power to condition a stay is inherent in the Committee's power to decide questions of procedure and protect the integrity of the proceedings.19 The same understanding has been endorsed by several ICSID *ad hoc* committees.20\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 88.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 92.\n\n21.\n\nIn the case at hand, security is necessary because of the serious risk of Ecuador's non-compliance,21 and because an unconditioned stay would cause overriding prejudice to Perenco considering the relatively low rate of post-award interest on the amounts awarded to Perenco.22 Furthermore, Respondent has not provided evidence that it would be extremely burdensome for it to provide a bank guarantee.23\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 95, 96.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 101.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 102.\n\n22.\n\nIn sum, Claimant requests that the Committee deny Ecuador's request for a continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, or in the alternative, that it order the stay to be conditioned on Ecuador providing, within 30 days of the Committee's decision, (i) a deposit for the net amount of the Award, including accrued interest, into an escrow account with a reputable international bank based outside of Ecuador, pledged in favour of Perenco and under the sole control of an international escrow agent and direction of the Committee; or (ii) an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or letter of credit for the net amount of the Award, including accrued interest, from a reputable international bank based outside of Ecuador, pledged in favour of Perenco and to be released on the order of the Committee.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n23.\n\nRespondent requests that the Committee maintain the stay of enforcement of the Award and deny Perenco's request to condition such stay on the posting of a security for the net amount of the Award.\n\n24.\n\nEcuador argues that the stay must be continued unless Perenco demonstrates that Ecuador's annulment and stay applications are dilatory, frivolous or abusive.24 Perenco contends that Ecuador's Application for Annulment was presented for the sole purpose of obtaining a stay, delaying payment, forcing Perenco to settle in exchange for a discount, and hiding assets pending the annulment proceedings. Yet, this assertion is untenable and false.25 Once Ecuador identified serious flaws on the Award and Decisions preceding the Award, it decided to present the Application for Annulment together with the request to stay enforcement of the Award.26\n\nEcuador's Reply to Perenco's Opposition to the Request to Continue the Provisional Stay of Enforcement, dated December 6, 2019 (\"Respondent's Reply on the Stay\"), p. 4.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 41.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 50.\n\n25.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Committee has full discretion to decide on the stay of enforcement of the Award.27 In order to exercise its discretion, the Committee shall take into consideration all factual elements that were proven by the Parties.28 Respondent further contends that if there is any sort of presumption concerning the enforcement, it would be in favor of maintaining the stay of the enforcement of the Award, as an element inherent in the right of an award debtor to seek annulment.29 Moreover, contrary to Claimant's position, nothing in the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Arbitration Rules conditions the stay to extraordinary circumstances such as being \"ravaged by war\" or \"'suffering an acute foreign exchange crisis' as Perenco posits.\"30 Conversely, ICSID *ad hoc* committees have tended to grant the stay of enforcement \"absent unusual circumstances.\"31\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 17.\n\nTr. Hearing on Stay of Enforcement, 24:12-17.\n\nTr. Hearing on Stay of Enforcement, 25:16-20.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 65.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 32 (emphasis omitted).\n\n26.\n\nAlthough the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules do not provide for specific circumstances to be satisfied for continuing the stay, Ecuador contends that even if required, these circumstances are met in the present case. To decide on the continuation of the stay of enforcement, *ad hoc* committees have assessed: (i) whether lifting the stay causes particularly adverse economic consequences to the award debtor; (ii) whether continuing the stay has particularly adverse economic consequences to the award creditor, including the risk that the applicant fails to comply with the award if not annulled; and (iii) the risk of non-recovery of the sums paid under the award if the stay were lifted and the award were subsequently annulled.32\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 75.\n\n27.\n\nAs regards the first circumstance, Ecuador states that lifting the stay would cause significant and unavoidable economic and social hardship for Ecuador.33 In early 2019, Ecuador faced a difficult situation and was forced to seek the support of the IMF through the Extended Fund Facility.34 As a result, Ecuador has undertaken structural reforms and is undergoing serious budgetary restrictions which would lead it to the path of growth and sustainable development and facilitate the capacity to reimburse debt contracted under previous regimes. Furthermore, massive and violent protests broke out in Ecuador after the elimination of fuel subsidies (which were withdrawn afterwards). The increased violence led the government to declare the state of emergency and to impose curfews and transit restrictions.35 It is estimated that the 10-day strike caused losses close to US$2,000 million.36\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 104.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 91.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 92.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 95.\n\n28.\n\nIn the present context of civil unrest in Ecuador, the consequences of immediate enforcement of US$411 million are beyond the ordinary consequences of budgetary reallocation and would cause significant and unavoidable economic and social hardship for Ecuador. This risk of further social unrest and the ensuing economic impact are of sufficient gravity to justify the continuation of the stay.37\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 104.\n\n29.\n\nAs regards the second circumstance, Perenco would not be prejudiced if the stay of enforcement is continued. Ecuador states that it has an exemplary record of compliance with awards, which it intends to maintain. In relation to the decision on provisional measures by the tribunal in the original arbitration, under the ICSID system, these amount to recommendations only.38 Ecuador has complied voluntarily with all the awards issued against it since 2004 and it has never faced an enforcement procedure, and argues that settlement is also a form of voluntary compliance.39 Therefore, Claimant's assertion that there is an incremental risk of non-payment in the future if the stay of enforcement is maintained, is erroneous.40 Moreover, it is irrelevant whether Ecuador denounced the ICSID Convention to the effects of Ecuador's compliance with the Award. Pursuant to Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, Ecuador's obligation to comply with the Award is still binding on Ecuador.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 164.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 127-131.\n\nTr. Hearing Stay of Enforcement, pp. 39-42.\n\n30.\n\nYet, even if the continuation of the stay could cause Perenco harm, the delay in the enforcement will be properly and fully remedied by post-award interest.41 Ecuador refutes Claimant's position that the interest granted in the Award would be insufficient, and in any event, it is not up to the Committee to improve on the terms of the Award.42\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 166.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 169.\n\n31.\n\nAs regards the third circumstance, Respondent states that it would suffer immediate and irreversible harm if the stay is lifted because it would be unable to recover any amounts paid to Perenco once the Award is annulled.43 Ecuador notes that Perenco is a mere shell company based in the Bahamas, devoid of any assets to be attached in any recoupment action.44 Claimant is a dormant entity, whose sole purpose and value is enforcing the Award. It is highly likely therefore that if Ecuador pays the Award, those funds will be transferred to other entities and Perenco will be liquidated.45 Were Respondent to pay now, once the Award is annulled, it would be nearly impossible or very difficult for Ecuador to recover any of the sums paid to Perenco.46\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 110-120.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 118.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 119, 120.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 110-120.\n\n32.\n\nWith respect to Claimant's request that the continuation of the stay should be conditioned upon the posting of a financial security, Ecuador contends that the Committee has no power to grant such request because Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention does not provide for this possibility and the Committee cannot imply this power from the silence of the Convention,47 nor does it have the power to recommend provisional measures.48 In the alternative, Ecuador argues that ordering the posting of a security amounts to penalizing the applicant for annulment because it places the award creditor in a better position than it would have been in, should the application not have been presented.49 Furthermore, escrowing the funds would cause Ecuador the same immediate hardship as lifting the stay, as it would result in over US$411 million being frozen, and thus made unavailable for Ecuador's development efforts.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 180, 181.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 183-196.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 203, 205.\n\n33.\n\nBased on the foregoing, Ecuador states that the circumstances presented before the Committee demonstrate that, on balance, continuing the stay would be less harmful to the award creditor than to the award debtor and therefore the stay of enforcement of the Award should be maintained.\n\n**IV. THE COMMITTEE 'S CONSIDERATIONS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nIn order to determine whether to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award, and considering the specific facts of this case, the Committee will address: (i) the applicable legal standard regarding the stay of enforcement of an ICSID Award; and (ii) the application of such standard in the present case.\n\n**A. Applicable legal standard regarding the stay of enforcement of an ICSID Award**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe first point facing the Committee is what the standard of review is to determine whether the stay of enforcement of the Award shall be continued.50 To address this question, the Committee must refer to the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, p. 4.\n\n36.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, \"[e]ither party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General [\u2026].\" In turn, Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that \"the party applying for [\u2026] annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates.\" The party requesting the stay, \"shall specify the circumstances that require the stay.\"51\n\nRule 54(4), ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n37.\n\nAccording to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, \"[i]f an application for the [\u2026] annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the SecretaryGeneral shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\"\n\n38.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, \"[t]he Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\"52\n\nArticle 52(5), ICSID Convention.\n\n39.\n\nIn the light of the aforementioned provisions in the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules and following the General Rule of Interpretation incorporated in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Committee concludes that a party to an award issued in an ICSID investment arbitration under the ICSID Convention has both the right to apply for annulment and the right to request the continuation of the stay. However, there is neither a right to the stay of enforcement, nor a presumption in favour or against the stay.\n\n40.\n\nFirst, the Committee notes that the stay of enforcement of an ICSID award may be requested by the applicant together with its application for annulment.53 The applicant may decide not to request the stay at the time of the application. Absent this request, the Secretary-General of ICSID could not grant the provisional stay of the award. In addition, absent a request in the application, *ad* hoc committees would only have the authority to decide on a stay if either party so requests after the *ad hoc* committee is constituted.54 Accordingly, the presentation of an application for annulment does not entail the automatic stay of enforcement of an ICSID award.\n\nArticle 52(5), ICSID Convention; Rule 54(1) and (2), ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nRule 54 (1), ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n41.\n\nSecond, pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, \"[a]s soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall **,** if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\" The word \"automatically\" refers to the termination of the stay, not to the continuation thereof. Therefore, there has to be a request by either party for the Tribunal to rule on the stay. Absent such request, the stay granted by the Secretary-General of ICSID shall automatically terminate.\n\n42.\n\nThird, according to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, \"the Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\"55\n\nArticle 52(5), ICSID Convention.\n\n43.\n\nThe Committee notes that the ordinary meaning of the word \"may\" expresses a possibility and the ordinary meaning of the expression \"if it considers\" indicates discretionally to take something into account when making a judgment. Thus, it is optional \u2013 not mandatory \u2013 for the committee to stay the enforcement of the Award if the circumstances so require. The crux of the matter is therefore whether there are circumstances requiring the stay.\n\n44.\n\nEcuador contends that the fact that Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that the continuation of the stay should be granted where the circumstances *require* it, \"does not subject the granting of a stay to a high threshold test or a showing of extraordinary circumstances such as being 'ravaged by war' or 'suffering an acute foreign exchange crisis', as Perenco posits.\"56\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 35, 36.\n\n45.\n\nThe Committee sides with Applicant that Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention does not demand \"extraordinary circumstances\" for the stay to be granted. However, the Committee disagrees with Ecuador in that said provision \u2013 or other provisions in the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Arbitration Rules \u2013demand that the stay should be granted \"absent unusual circumstances.\" The Committee notes that the word \"circumstances\" incorporated in Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention or in Rule 54(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules is not preceded by any qualifying adjective. The Committee therefore has wide discretion to weigh the circumstances presented by the Applicant to determine if these circumstances require the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n46.\n\nIn sum, neither the Convention nor the Arbitration Rules support Ecuador's argument that the stay must be continued unless Perenco demonstrates that Ecuador's annulment and stay applications are dilatory or abusive, nor do they support Perenco's assertion that Ecuador carries the burden of proof in a technical sense beyond specification that the circumstances require a continuation of the stay.\n\n47.\n\nAs to the practice of *ad hoc* committees in deciding on a continuation of a stay of enforcement, the Committee observes that it is far from uniform.\n\n48.\n\nIt is true that, traditionally, the majority of committees has exercised its discretion by granting a stay. As documented by the ICSID Secretariat for a period running until April 15, 2016, 36 decisions out of 41 ruled in favour of a stay, of which 22 were conditioned upon the issuance of some sort of security (13 decisions) or written undertakings (9 decisions), with 14 decisions granting the stay unconditionally. In 11 out of the 22 conditioned decisions, the stay was later terminated because the condition had not been satisfied.57 Even if in recent years some committees have taken a more restrictive approach in the exercise of their discretion, the predominant view remains unchanged.\n\nICSID Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the ICSID Administrative Council, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 58, **CAA-028**.\n\n49.\n\nHowever, statistics by themselves are not sufficient to draw a conclusion on the matter given that the circumstances of each case are different. Moreover, the Committee does not discern a *jurisprudence constante* with respect to an interpretation of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. As a consequence, both Parties can correctly rely on decisions that support their opposing positions. That \"may be explained by [the] lack of guidance in the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and the particular circumstances of each request.\"58 In fact, the texts confer discretion to committees to stay the enforcement and the \"criteria for the exercise of this discretion are the circumstances that may require the stay of enforcement.\"59\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, May 7, 2012, \u00b6 41, **AALA-0026**.\n\nC.H. Schreuer et al., The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd edition 2009, Art. 52, \u00b6 594, **AALA-0022**.\n\n50.\n\nYet, several issues are treated controversially by different *ad hoc* committees. Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules do not qualify the circumstances or set criteria that committees should apply to assess their relevance and relative weight, nor do they specify whether the discretion encompasses the appraisal of different circumstances or can only be exercised once circumstances are identified that require a stay, nor is the relation between the application for annulment and the application for the continuation of the stay fully clarified. Certainly, the application for the stay depends on the application for annulment, and the Convention states clearly \"that a stay is [a] distinct step from an annulment application itself.\"60 However, this does not clarify whether the quality and seriousness of the annulment application reflects on to the stay application.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 13.\n\n51.\n\nA number of committees have referred to \"[t]he prevailing practice in prior annulment cases [that] has been to grant the stay of enforcement. Although this practice does not create a presumption for continuation, and a committee is entitled to deviate from it, 'if it considers that the circumstances so require', the Committee finds that in this case there is no reason to deviate from the standard practice.\"61\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, September 30, 2013, \u00b6 50, **AALA-0010**.\n\n52.\n\nIn this perspective, the *ad hoc* committee in *Pey Casado v. Chile* determined:\n\nTurning first to the Republic's Request that the stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued pending its decision on the Application, the Committee notes that, although Article 52(5) of the Convention uses the verb \"may\", thereby conveying an element of discretion to the Committee, a review of the many decisions by *ad hoc* annulment committees since the MINE decision in 1988 leads the Committee to the conclusion that, absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings has now become almost automatic.\n\nIn the present case, the Committee is satisfied that the Republic has discharged its burden of proving that there are no unusual circumstances and that all the factors which the Republic has referred to support the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award pending the Committee's decision and it so rules.62\n\n*Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on the Republic of Chile's Application for a Stay of Enforcement of the Award, May 5, 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26, **AALA-0006**. In a Decision of March 15, 2018, the second *ad hoc* committee accepted the first committee's argument, although based only on reasons of \"procedural fairness and equality\". *See* *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on the Request for the Stay of the Enforcement of the Award, March 15, 2018, \u00b6 71, **AALA-0004**.\n\n53.\n\nIn *CMS v. Argentina*, the *ad hoc* committee ruled that \"[a]s a general matter a respondent State seeking annulment should be entitled to a stay provided it gives reasonable assurances that the award, if not annulled, will be complied with.\" It further ruled that the written undertaking by the *Procurador del Tesoro* expressing the irrevocable commitment to fulfil the pecuniary obligations was a sufficient element of all the circumstances to allow a continuation of the stay.63\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, September 1, 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 38, 50, **AALA-0025**.\n\n54.\n\nOther *ad hoc* committees insisted more on an explicit reference to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, which led the committee in *OI v. Venezuela*\n\nto a fundamental conclusion, set forth at the outset, that the continuation of the stay of enforcement in the ICSID system is far from automatic. ICSID Convention Article 52(5) provides that the stay shall continue if an *ad hoc* committee considers that \"the circumstances so require.\" Said article does not use other less categorical verbs, such as \"recommend,\" \"deserve,\" \"justify\" or similar words, but resorts to the imperative verb \"require.\" And the expression \"if it considers\" leaves wide discretion to an *ad hoc* committee to evaluate, case by case, if those circumstances are present or not, in order to continue a stay of enforcement, notwithstanding the binding and final nature of the awards.64\n\nAfter having considered the following circumstances as part of its discretional exercise: the risk of non-compliance, the risk of non-recovery, the quality of the annulment application, the possibility of irreparable harm, and the obligation to pay interest as compensation for the time-value of money, the committee ruled to lift the stay.\n\n*OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, April 4, 2016, \u00b6 89, **CAA-027**.\n\n55.\n\nIn *Standard Chartered v. Tanzania*, the *ad hoc* committee had an approach on the standard similar to *OI v. Venezuela.* It reasoned:\n\nThe use of the phrase: \"if it [the committee] considers that the circumstances so require,\" rather than the formulation \"so permit,\" indicates the necessity for the committee to positively establish circumstances prone to justify the requested stay on enforcement. The use of the word \"may\" indicates that it is a matter within the discretion of the committee whether or not to stay enforcement of the award pending its decision on an application for annulment. [\u2026]\n\nIn consideration of the previous, it is the view of the Committee that it is empowered to exercise its discretion as to whether or not to continue the stay on the enforcement of the Award pending its decision on the Application.65\n\nIn exercising its discretion by continuing the stay, the committee referred to the legitimacy of the annulment application:\n\nTANESCO has exercised its right to apply for annulment contemplated under the ICSID Convention, and as such it has a legitimate right to request that the stay is continued, until the final decision is rendered by the Committee. There is no reason to consider that in this particular case the institution of the annulment proceedings was purely dilatory in nature.66\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/20, Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, April 12, 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 52, **CAA-030**.\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/20, Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, April 12, 2017, \u00b6 61, **CAA-030**.\n\n56.\n\nIn turn, the *OI v. Venezuela* committee referred to *Libananco v. Turkey*, where the *ad hoc* committee argued:\n\nThe exercise of the discretion of the Committee depends on the circumstances surrounding the Stay Request and, therefore, the granting of a stay of enforcement or its continuation should in no way be regarded as automatic. The Committee is aware that some *ad hoc* annulment committees have considered that, \"absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings has now become almost automatic.\" However, this does not follow from the ICSID Convention or the Arbitration Rules, and the Committee considers that its decision should be based on an assessment of all relevant circumstances.67\n\nThe committee accepted the respondent's argument that the claimant bore no risk of compliance in case of an annulment in light of the respondent's record of fulfilment of its international obligations, that, conversely, the claimant itself was bankrupt exposing a high risk of recovery in case of the maintenance of the award, and it rejected the argument of other committees that the delay in enforcement is compensated by the accrued post-award interest. After this exercise of weighing and weighting, it stated that \"[t]o conclude, on balance, the Committee is of the view that Applicant's interest in a continued stay of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceeding should be given more weight than Respondent's interest in immediate enforcement,\"68 and decided to continue the stay.\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, May 7, 2012, \u00b6 43, **AALA-0026**.\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, May 7, 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 50-52, 54, **AALA-0026.**\n\n57.\n\nA similar pattern, albeit with a different result, appears in *Karkey v. Pakistan*. The *ad hoc* committee concluded that the facts and considerations asserted by the applicant \u2013 the effect of immediate payment on the budget, the risk of recovery in case of a successful annulment, the merits of the annulment application, and a written undertaking which only reiterated the respondent's obligations under the ICSID Convention \u2013 were not \"sufficient proof that circumstances exist in the present case which require a continuation of the stay, as mandated by Rule 54(4).\"69 Once having so concluded, \"the Committee consider[ed] that it can use its discretion to continue the stay subject to conditions which the Parties might find feasible and a preferable solution,\" such as a bank guarantee, a capitalized escrow account or a written undertaking providing sufficient assurance of compliance.70 Thus, unavoidably, the condition became an integrated criterion, consideration and part of the \"circumstances\", which were weighed in the exercise of the committee's discretion. In this perspective, the committee held that its decision \"would provide Karkey security in the case that the Award is upheld. On the other hand, it would ensure that Pakistan would not be exposed to enforcement attempts during this proceeding and could recoup any amounts if the Award is annulled.\"71\n\n*Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/26, Decision on the Request to Maintain the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, March 24, 2017, \u00b6 77, **CAA-029**. Similar conclusions were drawn by the *ad hoc* committee in *Valores Mundiales, S.L. and Consorcio Andino, S.L. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/11, Decision on the Request for Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, September 6, 2018, **CAA-039**.\n\n*Tenaris SA & Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/26, Decision on the Request to Maintain the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, March 24, 2017, \u00b6 90, **CAA-029**.\n\n60.\n\nIn *Tenaris II*, the *ad hoc* committee came to identical conclusions,75 despite a different emphasis on the applicable legal standards. After having found on the \"intimate link between an application for annulment and a request for stay\" despite the distinct steps to be followed,76 the committee argued:\n\nThe terms of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention must be interpreted in the context of the annulment mechanism. The Committee has no doubt that the provision does not intend to empower *ad hoc* committees to reject the request for a stay when the applicant pursues its legitimate right to have the award examined for fundamental institutional and procedural propriety in good faith and absent dilatory intentions. Therefore, the Committee subscribes to the mainstream jurisdiction of committees that exercise their discretion and grant stays when annulment of an award has been requested in good faith and neither with the abusive intention to escape the obligation to abide by its terms nor as a demonstration of its refusal to accept the obligation under the ICSID Convention to comply with the award. The Committee does not share the view that a context-free interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the term \"require\" in Article 54(5) [*sic*] of the ICSID Convention, should lead to a restriction of this general practice.77\n\n*Tenaris SA & Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/23, Decision on Venezuela's Request for the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, February 23, 2018, \u00b6 105, **CAA-036**.\n\n*Tenaris SA & Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/23, Decision on Venezuela's Request for the Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, February 23, 2018, \u00b6 103, **CAA-036**.\n\n*Tenaris SA & Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v.

Ecuador*. The *ad hoc* committee introduced the method of determination by insisting on two steps:\n\nAccording to Article 52(5), the Committee has to appreciate first whether circumstances are present that make it necessary to stay enforcement or continue the provisional stay of enforcement. Once the Committee has concluded that such circumstances exist, then it *may* decide in favor or against the continuation of the stay. The Committee emphasizes the term \"may\" because even when the required circumstances are present, a committee may decide against the continuation of the stay of enforcement. This wide discretion of the Committee in making its decision is compounded by the unspecified nature of the circumstances that may lead an annulment committee to conclude that they require that enforcement be stayed.78\n\nBy this argument, the committee limited its power of exercising discretion doubly. First, the power of exercising discretion only sets in after circumstances are established that require a continuation of the stay; second, the discretion can only be exercised in the sense to deny a stay although circumstances requiring a stay exist. The committee found that budgetary allocations are inherent in international pecuniary obligations, that the periodicity of budgetary planning cannot be a relevant circumstance except for extreme and exceptional situations, \"that Ecuador has failed to prove that the termination of the stay would lead to severe consequences for its ability to conduct its affairs.\" Since budgetary hardship had been the only circumstance asserted by the applicant, and this assertion had not been proven, \"this should be the end of the matter\", and the stay was lifted without necessitating the exercise of discretion.79\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, August 31, 2017, \u00b6 70, **CAA-033** (emphasis in original).\n\n*Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, August 31, 2017, \u00b6 85, **CAA-033**.\n\n62.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in *Infrastructure Services v. Spain* \"consider[ed] that the need to respect the finality of the award calls for greater restraint in deciding whether a stay of enforcement should be granted,\" and proposed \"that the circumstances which should exist for a stay to be required must, at the very least, rise above those which are common to most stay applications.\"80\n\n*Infrastructure Services and Energiy Termosolar v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31, Decision on the Continuation of the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award, October 21, 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 60, 66, **CAA-044**.\n\n63.\n\nThis Committee has carefully studied Articles 52(5), and also 51(4) and 50(2) of the ICSID Convention, as well as the rich case law. It sees a variety of solutions. Most of the distinctions are unavoidable and understandable to the extent that they relate to a variety of factual circumstances. Others are due to divergent legal positions.\n\n64.\n\nThis does not exclude that, with respect to a certain number of issues, a wide consensus exists as a result of the clear provisions of the Convention. This seems to be the case for the principled views that a continuation of the stay during period of annulment proceedings is not automatic but that the determination on the application for annulment and the application for a stay are based on distinct criteria, despite the close links between both applications. Further, the provisions of the Convention exclude a presumption in favour or against a continued stay of enforcement. Rather, committees have to exercise their discretion to determine each time whether the stay is warranted in light of the given circumstances.\n\n65.\n\nArticle 52(5) is, together with Articles 50(2) and 51(4), one of the provisions in the ICSID Convention empowering a tribunal or *ad hoc* committee to suspend the obligation of voluntary compliance or enforcement of an award although it has not (yet) lost its binding force as established under Article 53 of the Convention. The reason is that requests for interpretation, revision or annulment do not set aside the validity and the finality of an award as rendered but open such risk and thereby a period of uncertainty as to its final enforceability. The drafters of the Convention have tried to reconcile such transitional uncertainty and the highly valued finality. The efforts concentrated on enforcement, apparently in recognition of the fact that it is difficult to expect that a good faith applicant for any of the three remedies would voluntarily comply with an award, which it considers not final. Three alternatives were discussed for the three scenarios: an automatic stay of enforcement, the granting of discretion to domestic courts to refuse enforcement, and the granting of discretion to the tribunal/ *ad hoc* committee within the ICSID system to stay the enforcement.81 For all three constellations, the latter solution was preferred.\n\nFor a detailed analysis cf. C.H. Schreuer et al., The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd edition 2009, Art. 50, \u00b6\u00b6 42 ss, Art. 51, \u00b6\u00b6 34 ss., Art. 52, \u00b6\u00b6 574 ss, **AALA-0022**.\n\n66.\n\nArticles 50, 51 and 52 of the ICSID Convention empower the tribunal/ *ad hoc* committee which is asked to decide the merits of the request to exercise its discretion and stay the enforcement of the award. This Committee is convinced, in appreciating the drafting context and the ordinary meaning of the terms, that the aforementioned articles do not limit the tribunals'/ *ad hoc* committees' discretionary power to the question whether to reject an application for stay of enforcement although the circumstances require one.\n\n67.\n\nThey do also not limit the power by establishing a binding threshold for the question of what circumstances the tribunal/ *ad hoc* committee may take into consideration. It is uncontested that the application for annulment and with it the application for a stay of enforcement is an exceptional remedy. However, there is no indication that the exceptional character of the application requires that the circumstances requiring the stay must also be exceptional. The Committee agrees with the *Standard Chartered* committee in \"that establishing the existence of such circumstances is part of the Committee's discretionary power, and that Article 54(4) of the Arbitration Rules require the applicant to specify the circumstances requiring the stay.\"82\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/20, Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, April 12, 2017, \u00b6 53, **CAA-030**.\n\n68.\n\nEvidently, the exercise of discretion must be based on retraceable rationality and not be arbitrary. As provided by the ICSID Convention, circumstances requiring a stay are guiding criteria. There are no pre-defined criteria nor can the possible criteria be examined in isolation. They are interrelated and may have higher or lower pertinence in light of the specific factual circumstances of the case. In the practice of *ad hoc* committees since 1985, a number of such recurrent criteria have emerged. In his commentary, Schreuer summarizes them as follows:\n\n- the strength of the case for or against annulment,\n\n- whether the party seeking the stay also furnishes security for the award,\n\n- the risk that there would be problems in recovering payment made in compliance with the award should it be annulled,\n\n- whether there is a dilatory motive underlying the application for annulment,\n\n- the prospect of prompt enforcement of the award if it is upheld, including enforcement that is unimpeded by problems arising from immunity from execution,\n\n- hardship to either party in the event that the stay is continued, or lifted,\n\n- possible irreparable injury to the award debtor in the case of immediate enforcement.83\n\nC.H. Schreuer et al., The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 2nd edition 2009, Art. 52, \u00b6 609, **AALA-0022**.\n\n69.\n\nUnsurprisingly, these criteria appear, in one way or the other, also in the present case. The Committee will not examine them in isolation but in relation to each other, and in appreciation of their relative strength and weakness. In that perspective, the strength and merits of the annulment application are not *per se* a decisive circumstance in the sense of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention. However, its seriousness and absence of dilatory intentions contribute to an understanding of the interests that the applicant pursues and of its lack of preparedness to comply immediately voluntarily with the award. Further, the risks of compliance and of potential recovery have to be weighed. The Committee considers that, amongst the circumstances to be considered, is the risk of payment or nonpayment of the award after the conclusion of the annulment proceedings. A low risk for the creditor because the debtor will live up to its obligation to comply with the award if and to the extent that the annulment application is rejected, would be a circumstance that militates in favour of a deferred payment and thus a stay of enforcement. In this context, both the posting of a security or a written undertaking have to be taken into consideration to measure the risk, as much so as the payment obligation of post-award interest, which may reduce the inconvenience of a suspended payment. Likewise, a high risk for the debtor in the recovery of amounts already paid under the award, when and if the award is annulled, would militate in favour of a stay. Conversely, if there is a high risk of the creditor not to collect the amounts due under the award if the award is not annulled, or a low risk of the debtor not to recover paid or enforced amounts under the award if the award is annulled, those circumstances militate in favour of an immediate enforcement. In this context, proof of solvency of the creditor and a written undertaking promising prompt reimbursement of principal and interest have to be taken into consideration. In a certain way, securities and written undertakings are not 'conditions' for the decision on a stay but elements that influence the analysis of circumstances and assist committees in their rational exercise of discretion.\n\n70.\n\nIn sum, the Committee will exercise its discretion in view of balancing the interests of both Parties by appreciating the circumstances as specified by them.\n\n**B. Analysis of the specific circumstances in the present case**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Committee must take into consideration all the relevant circumstances to decide whether the stay is required.\n\n72.\n\nWhether or not the application for annulment is frivolous or dilatory is not the first circumstance that the Committee must address, much less the only circumstance that the Committee must consider. The least that can be expected is that the application is serious and not a mere attempt to delay payment.\n\n73.\n\nThe Committee considers that there are three circumstances that must be analysed cumulatively in the case at hand: (i) the risk of non-payment of the Award if the Application for Annulment is rejected; (ii) the risk of non-recovery if the stay is lifted and the Award is annulled; and (iii) the balance of hardship between the Parties.\n\n74.\n\nAs to the first circumstance, the Committee concludes that the evidence provided by Claimant is not sufficient to conclude that Ecuador will not honour its obligations under the ICSID Convention to pay the Award should the Committee reject the Application for Annulment. Nonetheless, based on the evidence on the record, the Committee shares Claimant's concern that the absence of a clear commitment on the part of Ecuador to pay the Award voluntarily, promptly, and in full in case it is not annulled is a circumstance that the Committee has to consider in its decision.84\n\nTr. Hearing Stay of Enforcement, 93:1-18.\n\n75.\n\nAs to the second circumstance, the Committee is of the view that Applicant has raised a valid concern that Perenco is a shell company with no assets to be attached in a recoupment action and that it may be very difficult for Ecuador to recover any of the sums paid to Perenco if the Award were to be annulled.85 This circumstance of Claimant being a shell company is not denied by Claimant. Moreover, Perenco not only offered an undertaking to return any sums collected from Ecuador if the Committee upholds the Application for Annulment but offered to provide a parent company letter or guarantee from Perenco S.A.86\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 110-120.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 67, 70.\n\n76.\n\nAs to the third circumstance, the Committee concludes that, on the one hand, Respondent has not demonstrated that it will suffer particular harm beyond the inherent or normal effects of an adverse ICSID award, and has not proven that the budgetary reallocations that would result if the stay is lifted are different or more onerous than the ones Ecuador would have to make if the stay is maintained, the Award is not annulled, and Ecuador has to pay after the Committee's decision. In respect to the social protests alleged by Respondent, the Committee sides with Claimant in that they were caused by actions or omissions of the State and there is no link whatsoever between the protests and the case at hand. On the other hand, Claimant has not demonstrated that it would suffer any prejudice that could not be compensated by the payment of interests accrued upon the delay. Although Claimant argues that the interest rate fixed in the Award is relatively low,87 the Committee considers that due to the nature of annulment proceedings, it is not in the position of second-guessing the Tribunal's decision on the applicable rate on post-Award interests accrued.\n\nClaimant's Opposition to the Stay, \u00b6 33.\n\n77.\n\nIn sum, the balance of hardship as submitted by the Parties leads the Committee to conclude that there is a dual risk that the Parties perceive and acknowledge. On the one hand, Claimant has manifested its concern that to date Ecuador has not committed to voluntarily, promptly, and in full, pay the Award. Ecuador, acknowledging said risk, has issued a letter that the Committee considers insufficient as it does not contain a clear and specific undertaking related to the Award.88 On the other hand, Respondent has expressed a concern as to the fact that Claimant is a shell company and Claimant has acknowledged such risk and has offered to provide a parent company letter or guarantee from Perenco S.A.\n\nTr. Hearing Stay of Enforcement, 93:2-9; *See* Respondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 126, where the Applicant states that: \"Ecuador has an exemplary track record of complying with international arbitral awards and shows predisposition to comply with its international obligations.\" *See also*, Respondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6 139, where the Applicant quotes the statement made by the Attorney General of Ecuador on September 30, 2019, regarding Ecuador's compliance with the Award as follows: \"In the end, what Ecuador will have to pay, if we do not succeed in annulling the award, will be 411 million, so I have summoned the Ministers of [...] Energy and Natural Resources and Economy and Finance to explore the real possibilities of complying with the award.\" (emphasis omitted)\n\n78.\n\nIn this context, the Committee considers that securing voluntary compliance by Ecuador if the stay is maintained and the Award is not annulled, and securing reimbursement by Perenco if the award is annulled, are elements that have a serious bearing on the circumstances it must weigh to determine if the stay shall be maintained.\n\n79.\n\nRespondent argues that the Committee has no power to condition the stay of the enforcement of the Award because the ICSID Convention does not expressly grant *ad hoc* committees with this power or with the power to order or recommend provisional measures.89 In this regard, the Committee considers, first, that *ad hoc* committees have the authority to order the granting of securities or written undertakings in connection with the stay of enforcement of an ICSID award. Such authority follows from the inherent powers of *ad hoc* committees to conduct the proceedings. To date, no committee has considered the opposite. Second, that, as already stated by the Committee, securities and written undertakings, in a certain way, are not 'conditions' for the decision on a stay but elements that influence the analysis of circumstances and assist *ad hoc* committees in their rational exercise of discretion. Third and last, that the Committee has the authority and discretion to determine, under the specific circumstances of the case, whether to order measures such as the ones requested by Claimant90 or to be satisfied with written undertakings such as the ones referred to in this decision. In any event the Committee remains with the authority to amend its decision on the stay, of course after hearing the Parties and considering the specific circumstances at the time.\n\nRespondent's Reply on the Stay, \u00b6\u00b6 179-193.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder on the Stay, \u00b6 107.\n\n80.\n\nThus, the Committee decides to provisionally continue the stay of enforcement of the Award subject to the following:\n\na. Respondent is ordered to provide the *ad hoc* Committee, within 60 days following this decision, with a letter signed by Ecuador's Minister of Finance or the official having full authority to bind Ecuador, committing to pay the Award unconditionally, voluntarily and in full, within 60 days after the Committee decides on the Application for Annulment, if the Application for Annulment were not to be upheld in full or in part, and attesting that such payment shall not be subject to any enforcement proceedings or to the intervention of Ecuador's courts.\n\nb. If Ecuador were not to provide the letter under \u00b6 80(a) with a text in form and substance satisfactory to the Committee within 60 days following the issuance of this decision, the stay shall be lifted if by such date, or at any time thereafter, Claimant has provided or provides the Committee with a letter signed by an officer having full authority to bind Perenco S.A. committing to unconditionally, voluntarily and in full reimburse Ecuador for any payments received under the Award, within 60 days after the Committee decides on the Application for Annulment, if the Application for Annulment were to be upheld in full or in part and attesting that such payment shall not be subject to any enforcement proceedings or court intervention.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n81.\n\nThe decision on costs for the phase related to the stay of enforcement of the Award will be made together with the final decision on the Application for Annulment.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Committee, based on the above considerations, decides to provisionally continue the stay of enforcement of the Award subject to the following:\n\na. Respondent is ordered to provide the *ad hoc* Committee, within 60 days following this decision, with a letter signed by Ecuador's Minister of Finance or the official having full authority to bind Ecuador, committing to pay the Award unconditionally, voluntarily and in full, within 60 days after the Committee decides on the Application for Annulment, if the Application for Annulment were not to be upheld in full or in part, and attesting that such payment shall not be subject to any enforcement proceedings or to the intervention of Ecuador's courts.\n\nb. If Ecuador were not to provide the letter under \u00b6 82(a) with a text in form and substance satisfactory to the Committee within 60 days following the issuance of this decision, the stay shall be lifted if by such date or at any time thereafter Claimant has provided or provides the *ad hoc* Committee with a letter signed by an officer having full authority to bind Perenco S.A. committing to unconditionally, voluntarily and in full reimburse Ecuador for any payments received under the Award, within 60 days after the Committee decides on the Application for Annulment, if the Application for Annulment were to be upheld in full or in part and attesting that such payment shall not be subject to any enforcement proceedings or court intervention.\n\n83.\n\nThe decision on the allocation of costs arising from the request for a continuation of the stay is reserved.\n\n84.\n\nAll other requests are rejected."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 2 (Annulment Proceeding)", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2020-04-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 2 (Annulment Proceeding)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn October 2, 2019, Ecuador presented an Application for Annulment of the Award dated September 27, 2019 (the \u201c**Application for Annulment**\u201d), issued in the Underlying Arbitration. Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, the Applicant requested the ICSID Secretary-General to notify the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award until the *ad hoc* Committee rules on such request, and that the stay be maintained until a decision on the Application for Annulment is rendered by the Committee.1 On that same day the Application for Annulment was transmitted to Perenco.\n\nRespondent's Application for Annulment, October 2, 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 250-252.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated October 4, 2019, the Acting ICSID Secretary-General registered the Application for Annulment and notified the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n9.\n\nOn October 15, 2019, the Secretary-General informed the Parties the intention of ICSID to propose to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council the appointment to the *ad hoc* committee of Professor Eduardo Zuleta Jaramillo, a national of Colombia, as President, Professor Dr. Rolf Knieper, a national of Germany, and Professor M\u00f3nica Pinto, a national of Argentina, as committee members (the \u201c**Committee**\u201d).\n\n10.\n\nOn November 6, 2019, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Centre had taken note of the correspondence of the Parties and Professors Zuleta and Knieper, and that it would inform the Parties once the appointments had been made. On that same day the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Professor Eduardo Zuleta, Professor Dr. Rolf Knieper and Professor M\u00f3nica Pinto to the *ad hoc* Committee, and ICSID proceeded to seek their acceptance of the appointments.\n\n11.\n\nOn November 8, 2019, Perenco submitted its Opposition to Ecuador's Request to Continue the Provisional Stay of Enforcement, dated November 7, 2019, accompanied by Annex A (Decisions on Stays of Enforcement since November 2014), as well as Exhibits CEA-001 to CEA-039 and Legal Authorities CAA-001 to CAA-044. In its Opposition to the Stay, Perenco requested that the Committee lift the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award pending its decision on the Application for Annulment, or in the alternative, that the *ad hoc* Committee order Ecuador to provide, within 30 days of its decision on the issue of the stay, a deposit for the net amount of the Award, including accrued interest, into an escrow account; or an unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or letter of credit for the net amount of the Award, including accrued interest.2\n\nClaimant's Opposition to the Stay, \u00b6 40; Claimant's Rejoinder to Ecuador's Request to Continue the Provisional Stay of Enforcement, December 18, 2019, \u00b6 107.\n\n12.\n\nOn November 18, 2019, the Committee was constituted in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 6, 52(2), and 53. Ms. Veronica Lavista, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Committee.\n\n13.\n\nIn separate communications dated November 19, 2019 and November 21, 2019, Applicant and Perenco, respectively, presented their comments regarding the schedule of submissions and the hearing on the issue of the stay.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated November 25, 2019, the Committee fixed the schedule of written submissions regarding the issue of the stay. The timetable was set as follows: on or before December 6, 2019 Ecuador would file its reply to Perenco's opposition to the request for continuation of the stay; on or before December 18, 2019 Perenco would file its rejoinder on the request for continuation of the stay; and an oral hearing on the continuation of the stay would take place in Washington, D.C., which would be conducted together with the First Session of the annulment proceeding. In the same letter, the Committee decided to maintain the stay of enforcement until it issued its decision on the continuation of the stay.\n\n15.\n\nOn December 6, 2019, Ecuador filed its Reply to Perenco's Opposition to the Request to Continue the Provisional Stay of Enforcement, along with Exhibits AAE-0001 to AAE-0029 and Legal Authorities AALA-0001 to AALA-0038.\n\n16.\n\nOn December 18, 2019, Perenco filed its Rejoinder to Ecuador's Request to Continue the Provisional Stay of Enforcement, along with Exhibits CEA-040 to CEA-064 and Legal Authorities CAA-039, CAA 041, CAA-042, CAA-045 to CAA-054.\n\n17.\n\nThe first session and oral hearing on the continuation of the stay took place in person on January 13, 2020 in Washington, D.C.

The Committee further stated that it may revisit its decision to maintain the stay at any time during the proceedings if the circumstances so merit and unless otherwise indicated by the Committee, any lifting of the stay will require compliance by Perenco with paragraph 82(b) of the Decision on the Stay.\n\n25.\n\nOn July 16, 2020, in accordance with the procedural calendar set out in Procedural Order No. 1, Perenco filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment (\u201c**Counter-Memorial on Annulment**\u201d), accompanied by a Consolidated Index of Exhibits and Legal Authorities, Exhibits CEA-065 to CEA-146, and Legal Authorities CAA-055 to CAA-092.\n\n26.\n\nOn September 16, 2020, in accordance with the procedural calendar set out in Procedural Order No. 1, Ecuador filed its Reply on Annulment (\u201c**Reply on Annulment**\u201d), accompanied by a Consolidated Index of Exhibits and Legal Authorities, Exhibits AAE-0210 to AAE-0221, and Legal Authorities AALA-0110 to AALA-0126.\n\n27.\n\nIn the light of the restrictions on travel and movement resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, on October 16, 2020, the Committee invited the Parties to submit by October 30, 2020 their views on the possibility to organize the hearing on annulment remotely.\n\n28.\n\nOn October 28, 2020, the Parties informed the Committee of their agreement to hold a 2-day hearing remotely via Zoom on January 12 and 13, 2021. The Parties also agreed on the duration of opening statements and rebuttals, which was submitted to the Committee's consideration. The Parties requested that, in order for the hearing to best serve the Committee's needs, they would be grateful to receive any questions that the Committee may have for the Parties in advance.\n\n29.\n\nOn November 16, 2020, in accordance with the procedural calendar set out in Procedural Order No. 1, Perenco filed its Rejoinder on Annulment (\u201c**Rejoinder on Annulment**\u201d), accompanied by a Consolidated Index of Exhibits and Legal Authorities, Exhibits CEA-147 to CEA-163, and Legal Authorities CAA-056 (resubmitted) and CAA-093 to CAA-107.\n\n30.\n\nOn December 8, 2020, the Committee and the Parties were notified that Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein, ICSID Legal Counsel, would serve as Acting Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee during the absence of Ms. Lavista.\n\n31.\n\nOn December 21, 2020, the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by videoconference pursuant to Section 16 of Procedural Order No. 1. The Committee and the Parties discussed logistical questions, procedures and administrative items in relation to the preparation of the virtual hearing.\n\n32.\n\nOn December 21, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 3 on the organization of the hearing.\n\n33.\n\nOn January 7, 2021, the Committee sent the Parties a list of issues it invited them to address at the hearing.\n\n34.\n\nThe Hearing on Annulment was held virtually on January 12 and 13, 2021 via Zoom and administered by Sparq (the \u201c**Hearing on Annulment**\u201d).

The fact that certain arguments, documents, or legal authorities are not mentioned in the following sections does not mean that the Committee has not considered them.\n\n40.\n\nIn Section III of the present decision, the Committee addresses the applicable legal framework to annulment proceedings under the ICSID Convention, including the grounds raised by Ecuador provided for in Article 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention. In Section IV, the Committee addresses each of the specific grounds raised by the Applicant. These grounds are classified in matters of jurisdiction, merits, damages, and counterclaims. In Section V, the Committee addresses the costs of the annulment proceeding. And, in Section VI, the Committee sets out its decision.\n\n**III. THE APPLICABLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**A. A****nnulment under the** **ICSID C****onvention**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n**a. Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n41.\n\nFor the Applicant, Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention should not be interpreted in a restrictive manner. Article 52(1) already limits the annulment of an award to five specific grounds. Accordingly, the purview of *ad hoc* committees should not be restricted further than what Article 52(1) provides,3 or any part thereof if appropriate. Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention should be interpreted neither narrowly nor broadly.4\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 180-181.\n\nApplication for Annulment, \u00b6 25; Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 181.\n\n42.\n\nThe ICSID Convention must be interpreted in light of its object and purpose, which in the context of annulment, is to secure the fundamental integrity of the ICSID system. Thus, in the presence of one of the limited grounds for annulment set forth in Article 52, a committee should annul the award.5 Ecuador states that \u201cwithout this safeguard some States parties might not have accepted the ICSID Convention.\u201d6\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 182.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 15.\n\n43.\n\nEcuador further claims that Perenco mischaracterizes the nature of ICSID annulment.\n\n44.\n\nFirst, Perenco purports to establish a \u201chigh threshold\u201d and a \u201chigh bar for annulment in general\u201d that is absent from the text of the ICSID Convention. For Ecuador, there is no presumption in favor of the validity of the award in the Convention, nor is it required that *ad hoc* committees preserve the finality of ICSID awards favoring validity over annulment. The committee in *Soufraki* rejected such presumption. Likewise, the committees in *MINE*, *Amco II*, and *Kl\u00f6ckner II* rejected any alleged privilege to finality.7 Ecuador claims that Perenco encourages the Committee to adopt a \u201crestrictive\u201d interpretation of the grounds for annulment. Yet, as expressed by the committee in *Total*, \u201cArticle 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither narrowly nor broadly.\u201d8 In any event, for Ecuador it is unclear what legal consequences Perenco seeks to derive from the high threshold it proposes given that there is no special burden or standard of proof applicable to ICSID annulment proceedings.9\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 14.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 16.\n\n45.\n\nSecond, Perenco appears to suggest that because annulment is not an appeal, the Committee should reject Ecuador's arguments that would involve \u201c\u2018extensive' or \u2018detailed' analysis\u201d10 of the Award. However, no such limitation exists in the Convention. The questions presented to an *ad hoc* committee require varying degrees of inquiry depending on the specific circumstances of the case.11 As such, when an award reflects a complex legal and factual background, a review of that background is required.12\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 183.\n\n46.\n\nThird, Perenco contends that even if a ground for annulment is established, *ad hoc* committees should exercise their discretion to decline annulment. Nonetheless, Perenco fails to mention that, as expressed by the committee in *CEAC v. Montenegro*, such \u201cdiscretion is by no means unlimited [\u2026].\u201d And, in any event, no *ad hoc* committee has ever declined to annul an award after having found one of the grounds provided in Article 52(1) to be engaged.13\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.\n\n**b. Perenco's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n47.\n\nPerenco argues that Ecuador mischaracterizes and ignores the explicit terms of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention and its context and purpose.\n\n48.\n\nUnder Article 52, annulment is an \u201cexhaustive, exceptional and narrowly circumscribed\u201d derogation from the principle of finality of awards. Thus, the threshold for annulment is high. Annulment is a remedy reserved for \u201cegregious violations of certain basic principles,\u201d14 and \u201cfor unusual and important cases involving situations that are grossly illegitimate.\u201d15 The narrow purpose of the annulment remedy is to \u201cprevent flagrant cases of excess of jurisdiction and injustice.\u201d16 Thus, annulment exists to safeguard the arbitral process, not to second-guess its substance.17\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 6.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 66.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 66.\n\n49.\n\nPerenco observes that, according to the ICSID Secretariat's Updated Background Paper on Annulment, \u201c\u2018*ad hoc* committees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision, and an *ad hoc* committee cannot substitute the Tribunal's determination on the merits for its own[\u2026]' Committees must \u2018take as their premise the record before the Tribunal.' A committee cannot replace an annulled award by \u2018its own decision on the merits,' nor can annulment be a forum to \u2018make new arguments on the merits that were not made in the original proceedings.' Otherwise, \u2018the annulment mechanism of Article 52 would slide into an appeal.'\u201d18\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 67.\n\n50.\n\nPerenco contends that annulment is not automatic. Even if a tribunal committed an error contemplated in Article 52(1), an *ad hoc* committee has the discretion to annul or to confirm the award. This discretion follows from the language of Article 52(3), which provides that the Committee \u201cshall have the authority to annul an award or any part thereof on any grounds set forth in paragraph (1)\u201d\u2014not that the Committee \u201cshall\u201d annul the award. In exercising this discretion, committees \u201cmust take account of all relevant circumstances, including the gravity of the circumstances which constitute the ground for annulment and whether they had\u2014or could have had\u2014a material effect upon the outcome of the case, as well as the importance of the finality of the award and the overall question of fairness to both Parties.\u201d19\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 70-72; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 3.\n\n51.\n\nAccording to Perenco, several *ad hoc* committees have recognized that they should not exercise their discretion to annul an award \u201cif and when annulment is clearly not needed to remedy procedural injustice and annulment would unwarrantably erode the binding force and finality of ICSID Awards.\u201d20 As noted by the *Vivendi II* committee, there is an \u201coverriding principle that all litigation must come to an end unless there are strong reasons for it to continue.\u201d21\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 70.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 70.\n\n52.\n\nPerenco further contends that an annullable error does not necessarily entail annulment of the entire award. Under Article 52(3), an *ad hoc* committee has the authority to annul an award or any part thereof.22\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 71.\n\n53.\n\nAs regards the question of whether or not a presumption of validity exists, Perenco asserts that it is an irrelevant and unhelpful distinction given that the Convention establishes an award's presumed validity because it provides that an ICSID award is \u201cbinding on the parties.\u201d Thus, the Award's validity is presumed unless and until Ecuador carries its burden to demonstrate that it should be annulled.23\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 8.\n\n54.\n\nAs described below, Perenco refutes Ecuador's characterization of the grounds provided in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, under which it requests the annulment of the Award.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that ICSID awards are binding on the disputing parties, may not be appealed, and are not subject to any remedies except those provided for in the Convention.24\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 11.\n\n56.\n\nUnder Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n57.\n\nAlbeit the Claimant states that Article 52 must be restrictively interpreted, the Committee observes that nothing in the ICSID Convention provides for a restrictive or a broad interpretation of Article 52 or any other provision applicable to annulment proceedings. Accordingly, Article 52 and the other relevant rules on annulment, shall be interpreted in the light of Articles 31 and 32 of the of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \u201c**VCLT**\u201d), which are customary international law.\n\n58.\n\nIn light of \u201cthe ordinary meaning of the terms of [Article 52 of the ICSID Convention] in their context and in the light of its object and purpose,\u201d the Committee finds that the grounds set out in Article 52(1) are exhaustive, and therefore *ad hoc* committees have no power to annul an award under any other grounds.\n\n59.\n\nThe Committee stresses that finality of awards is one of the cornerstones of the ICSID system. As an exception to such rule, annulment is a limited remedy designed to safeguard the fundamental fairness and integrity of the underlying arbitration.25 Consequently, an *ad hoc* committee shall not act as an appellate court to review the substance of the Award and it is not entitled to substitute its views for those of the tribunal because it disagrees with the substantive outcome of the award. This analysis is confirmed by Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, which stresses that the \u201caward [\u2026] shall not be subject to any appeal.\u201d\n\n*Alapli Elektrik B.V. v. Republic of Turke*y, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/13, Decision on Annulment, July 10, 2014, \u00b6 32 (CAA-023); *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki, June 5, 2007, \u00b6 20 (AALA-039).\n\n60.\n\nThe *travaux pr\u00e9paratories* of the ICSID Convention\u2014a supplementary means of interpretation according to Article 32 of the VCLT\u2014further shed light on the scope of Article 52, confirming the interpretation of said provision under Article 31 of the VCLT. As noted in the Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID,\n\n[T]he drafting history of the ICSID Convention also demonstrates that annulment \u2018is not a procedure by way of appeal requiring consideration of the merits of the case, but one that merely calls for an affirmative or negative ruling based upon one [of the grounds for annulment.]' It does not provide a mechanism to appeal alleged misapplication of law or mistake in fact [\u2026].26\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 72.\n\n61.\n\nFollowing the general principle *onus probandi incumbit ei qui agit non qui negat*, the Applicant has the burden of demonstrating that the Award or any part thereof should be annulled under one or more of the grounds provided in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.27\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/20, Decision on Annulment, August 22, 2018, \u00b6 461 (CAA-083); *Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Annulment, December 27, 2016, \u00b6 160 (AALA-062).\n\n62.\n\nThe degree of inquiry and analysis that an *ad hoc* committee must undertake to determine if one or more of the annulment grounds have been engaged is not merely a superficial or formal one. Although Perenco claims that no extensive analysis is required, the Committee finds no reference in the ICSID Convention suggesting that there is a limitation to the extension or detail of a committee's analysis, provided, of course, that it remains within the limits of its powers. To the contrary, by conducting a superficial or narrow review of an award, a committee may omit critical premises to understand the tribunal's decision. Moreover, some premises must be read in context so that their scope and meaning is properly understood.\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention confers discretion to *ad hoc* committees not to annul an award even if a tribunal committed an annullable error. For Perenco, if annulment is not necessary to preserve the fundamental integrity of the ICSID system, an award should not be annulled. The Committee is of the view that while it is true that Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention states that an *ad hoc* committee \u201cshall have the authority\u201d to annul the award or any part thereof [\u2026],\u201d the discretion resulting from such provision should not be interpreted to defeat the object and purpose of the annulment remedy\u2014\u201c[the] safeguard against \u2018violations of the fundamental principles of law governing the Tribunal's proceedings'\u201d28\u2014or to erode the binding force and finality of awards. To the Committee's knowledge, even though Article 53 provides discretion to *ad hoc* committees, no *ad hoc* committee has ever found an annullable error under one or more of the grounds set out in Article 52(1) but has refused to annul the Award or any part thereof on such grounds.\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 71.\n\n64.\n\nIn sum, as explained in ICSID's Updated Background Paper on Annulment, \u201c(1) the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only grounds on which an award may be annulled; (2) annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of an *ad hoc* [c]ommittee is limited; (3) *ad hoc* [c]ommittees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision, and an *ad hoc* [c]ommittee cannot substitute the Tribunal's determination on the merits for its own; (4) *ad hoc* [c]ommittees should exercise their discretion not to defeat the object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and finality of awards; (5) Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither narrowly nor broadly; and (6) an *ad hoc* [c]ommittee's authority to annul is circumscribed by the Article 52 grounds specified in the application for annulment, but an *ad hoc* [c]ommittee has discretion with respect to the extent of an annulment, i.e., either partial or full.\u201d29\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 74.\n\n**B.

Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n65.\n\nEcuador states Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention provides for the annulment of an award when \u201cthe Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers.\u201d Said ground is engaged if two requirements are met: that the tribunal exceeded the scope of its powers and the excess of powers was manifest.30\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 189.\n\n66.\n\nAs to the excess of powers, the scope of a tribunal's powers is defined by reference to the parties' consent to arbitration, the applicable law, and the issues submitted by the parties for the tribunal's decision. A tribunal exceeds its powers when it purports to exercise jurisdiction that it does not have, fails to apply the applicable law, or makes egregious errors of fact or weighs the evidence irrationally.31\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 191-192.\n\n67.\n\nFirst, a tribunal exceeds its powers when it exercises its jurisdiction over a person or entity which is not an investor over which the tribunal has jurisdiction under the applicable treaty, or over a subject matter that does not constitute a protected investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention or the applicable treaty.32\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 193-194.\n\n68.\n\nSecond, a tribunal exceeds its powers when it fails to apply the proper applicable law to the dispute, or when it fails to apply any law at all.33 A distinction must be drawn between a failure to apply the law and a mere error in its application. \u201cWhere the tribunal's analysis is a gross misapplication or misinterpretation of the law amounting to effective disregard or non-application of the law, it constitutes a failure to apply the law,\u201d as recognized by the *ad hoc* committees in *Sempra*, *Soufraki*, *Caratube*, and *Pey Casado*.34 A committee's review of a tribunal's application of the law must be objective rather than subjective.35\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 195-196.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 198.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 199-200.\n\n69.\n\nThird, a tribunal exceeds its powers when it commits egregious errors of fact or provides an irrational assessment of the evidence before it.36\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 201-202.\n\n70.\n\nAs to the requirement that a tribunal's excess of power be manifest, *ad hoc* committees agree that such requirement \u201crefers to how readily apparent the excess is, rather than to its gravity.\u201d From the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cmanifest\u201d, the excess of power must be plain, clear, obvious, or evident.37\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 203-204.\n\n71.\n\nEcuador observes that both Parties agree that Article 52(1)(b) imposes a two-part test requiring that the Committee determine (i) whether an excess of powers has occurred, and if so, (ii) whether it was manifest. The Parties also agree that a tribunal manifestly exceeds its powers whenever it assumes jurisdiction it does not have, or rules *ex aequo et bono* without the Parties' consent.38 Yet, Ecuador contends that Perenco mischaracterizes the legal standard for manifest excess of power in three ways:\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 26.\n\n72.\n\nFirst, Perenco misrepresents the Applicant's position. Ecuador's position is not that a misapplication or misinterpretation of the law is an excess of powers, its position is that \u201c[w]here the tribunal's analysis is a gross misapplication or misinterpretation of the law amounting to effective disregard or non-application of the law, it constitutes a failure to apply the law.\u201d39 The essential inquiry therefore is not just whether the tribunal erred in the application of the law, but whether that error is \u201cso gross or egregious as substantially to amount to failure to apply the proper law.\u201d40\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 28.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 30.\n\n73.\n\nPerenco encourages the application of a \u201csubjective\u201d approach to determine whether the Tribunal has applied the proper law, i.e. that \u201cso long as \u2018the Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and endeavoured to apply it,' it cannot have exceeded its powers.\u201d41 Ecuador argues that the prevailing approach in ICSID annulment is the \u201cobjective\u201d one; namely that \u201cit is necessary for the Committee to review what the Tribunal actually analyzed and held, rather than what the Tribunal declared having done,\u201d as expressed by the committee in *Iberdrola*. Therefore, as observed by the committee in *Amco II*, \u201c[\u2026] an *ad hoc* committee may find that the misapplication, etc. of national law is of such nature or degree as to constitute objectively (regardless of the Tribunal's actual or presumed intentions) its effective nonapplication.\u201d This objective approach has been endorsed also by the *Total* committee.42\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 30, referring to Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 76.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n\n74.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, Perenco appears to consider that a minor and innocuous misapplication of the law is the equivalent of a misapplication that is so egregious as to render the legal framework unrecognizable to an objective observer. Yet, \u201cthe line between non-application of the proper law and its misapplication may be difficult to draw but it exists.\u201d To draw such line, the Committee must determine whether the Tribunal \u201cstayed within the limits of th[e] applicable law,\u201d43 as expressed by the committee in *SAUR*.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\n75.\n\nAlthough Perenco claims that an excess of powers arises only when the tribunal \u201ccommitted a complete failure to apply the correct body of law,\u201d it is widely accepted that it is \u201can excess of power for a tribunal to fail to apply the law applicable to the case or to the particular issue in the case.\u201d44\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 40.\n\n76.\n\nSecond, Article 52(1)(b) refers in general to \u201cpowers.\u201d It is not restricted to jurisdiction or failure to apply the law. Therefore, it is possible that a tribunal exceeds its power to assess the evidence. Ecuador advances that \u201cwhen a tribunal reaches a conclusion \u2013whether factual or otherwise\u2013 that \u2018shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety,' that tribunal has exceeded its adjudicatory powers under the Convention.\u201d45 As recognized by arbitral tribunals and annulment committees, ICSID tribunals enjoy no unfettered discretion. Any discretion enjoyed by a tribunal is limited by the applicable law.46\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 46.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47.\n\n77.\n\nThird, Perenco attempts to add non-existent requirements into the word \u201cmanifest.\u201d In the first place, it tries to discredit the position that determining whether a manifest excess of powers has occurred may require \u201cextensive argumentation and analysis.\u201d For Perenco, that is \u201cirreconcilable with the ordinary meaning of the term \u2018manifest,' in light of its object and purpose.\u201d Yet, the word \u201cmanifest\u201d must also be interpreted in the context of investor-State arbitration, where complex legal and technical issues are discussed.47 Then, Perenco tries to discredit Ecuador's position that an excess of powers need not be grave to be manifest. Nonetheless, the prevailing view among committees is that \u201c\u2018manifest' refers to how readily apparent the excess is, rather than to its gravity.\u201d This has been also recognized by Prof. Schreuer. Albeit Perenco claims that an excess of power must be both textually obvious and substantively serious, as expressed by the committee in *Soufraki*, Ecuador remarks that the *Soufraki* committee was simply underscoring that a \u201cmanifest excess of powers\u201d will not only be obvious, but also inherently serious, given that it implicates a transgression of the tribunal's mandate.48\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.\n\n**b. Perenco's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n78.\n\nPerenco submits that Ecuador is wrong that a \u201cmisapplication or misinterpretation of the law\u201d is an excess of powers. As its name implies, an \u201cexcess of powers\u201d arises in the case of an award *ultra*, *extra*, or *citra petita*: one that goes beyond the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement by deciding points that had not been submitted for decision or fails to carry out its mandate by completely disregarding the applicable law and deciding the dispute on some other basis.49\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 74.\n\n79.\n\nAs confirmed by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention, mistakes are not an excess of powers. In fact, the drafters of the ICSID Convention rejected a \u201cserious misapplication of the law\u201d as a ground for annulment. Accordingly, an excess of powers arises only when the tribunal committed a \u201ccomplete failure to apply the correct body of law.\u201d So long as \u201cthe Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and endeavoured to apply it,\u201d it cannot have exceeded its powers.50\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.\n\n80.\n\nPerenco notes that Ecuador's position that \u201cgross\u201d or \u201cegregious\u201d errors of law are annullable is mistaken. Conceptually, there is no difference between one incorrect interpretation of the law and another one regardless of the adjectival qualification given. Both entail a qualification of how the tribunal applied the correct body of law, not whether it endeavored to apply it. Thus, when the tribunal in fact applies the proper law, but does so incorrectly\u2014no matter how \u201cgross\u201d or \u201cegregious\u201d that error\u2014there is no excess of powers. Furthermore, Perenco notes that none of the decisions Ecuador invokes found that the tribunal committed a gross or egregious error of law warranting annulment.51\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.\n\n81.\n\nEcuador is wrong that a tribunal exceeds its powers when it makes egregious errors of fact or weighs the evidence irrationally. As noted in the annulment decision in *Dogan*, \u201cit is not within the *ad hoc* committee's remit to re-examine the facts of the case to determine whether a tribunal erred in appreciating or evaluating the available evidence.\u201d Furthermore, the decisions referred to by Ecuador do not support its position.52\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 79-80; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 7.\n\n82.\n\nAs to the qualification of \u201cmanifest\u201d set out in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, Perenco observes that while Ecuador accepts that \u201cmanifest\u201d means that the excess of powers must be \u201cobvious,\u201d \u201cclear,\u201d or \u201cevident,\u201d it asserts that an excess of powers may be manifest even if an \u201cextensive argumentation and analysis may be required to prove\u201d it. Such approach is irreconcilable with the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cmanifest,\u201d in light of its object and purpose. Perenco further objects Ecuador's contention that \u201ccommittees agree\u201d that an excess of powers need not be grave in order to be \u201cmanifest.\u201d \u201c[I]t is well established that an excess of powers must be both \u2018textually obvious and substantively serious' to qualify as \u2018manifest.'\u201d53\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 81-83.\n\n83.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Annulment, Perenco remarks that the specific grounds Ecuador \u201clabels as \u2018manifest excess of power' are not that the Tribunal exceeded its mandate by, for example, deciding a dispute not submitted to it, or arrogating to itself some extraordinary power it did not have. Rather, Ecuador alleges that the Tribunal made legal or factual errors in the way it decided the issues that were within its mandate to decide.\u201d54\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 11.\n\n84.\n\nFirst, Ecuador failed to find a single decision in which an award was annulled for an error of law, even a gross or egregious one. Ecuador also misquotes the ICSID Background Paper and the *CEAC* decision.55 Contrary to Ecuador's claim that the *travaux* of the ICSID Convention \u201cstand for the uncontroversial proposition that a simple error of law is not ground for annulment, whereas failure to apply the applicable law is,\u201d the *travaux* unequivocally confirm that the drafters rejected the proposition that \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cerroneous\u201d errors of law warrant annulment. As to the *CEAC* decision, the committee rejected CEAC's argument that the tribunal had committed an \u201cegregious mistake.\u201d56\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 14.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 14.\n\n85.\n\nEcuador advocates for an \u201cobjective\u201d approach to a tribunal's analysis. However, the alleged distinction between \u201cobjective\u201d and \u201csubjective\u201d review is too facile to be meaningful, and dangerous in its implications. Because a tribunal's role is to decide disputed matters, a tribunal will necessarily decide a dispute with some degree of subjectivity. Furthermore, Ecuador's proposed approach would make subjectivity worse. \u201cFor if this Committee examined how the Tribunal ought to have decided legal issues, as Ecuador suggests it should, it would be substituting its own necessarily subjective interpretation of the law for the Tribunal's findings\u2014and doing so without the benefit of the entire record, oral evidence or detailed argument on the substance of the issues.\u201d57 Perenco further claims that even the cases Ecuador cites for this subjective/objective distinction do not support the approach it urges.58\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 16.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 18.\n\n86.\n\nSecond, Ecuador has completely failed to address the proposition that alleged errors in assessing factual evidence cannot comprise a manifest excess of powers because assessing and weighing evidence lies at the core of a tribunal's mandate, not outside it. Perenco states that there is committee consensus on this position.59\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 20.\n\n87.\n\nThird, in its Reply on Annulment, Ecuador presented the novel argument that committees should review jurisdictional decisions *de novo*. This argument contradicts its own position in the Memorial, i.e., that \u201ca lack of jurisdiction *ratione personae* will constitute a manifest excess of powers if the excess of jurisdiction is obvious or evident,\u201d and is wrong. As explained by Prof. Schreuer, the stability of the system could be threatened \u201cif an *ad hoc* committee could simply substitute its view on jurisdiction for that of the tribunal.\u201d60 Also, \u201cEcuador's argument that \u2018[t]he questions presented to an *ad hoc* committee will require varying degree of inquiry depending on the specific ground involved' is similarly unavailing.\u201d61\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 21-24.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 24.\n\n88.\n\nFourth, Ecuador's argument that \u201cextensive argumentation\u201d can be used to show an obvious error fails to recognize that the drafters of the ICSID Convention made a conscious decision to limit annullable errors to only those that were \u201cmanifest\u201d to alleviate concerns that, without it, there would be a risk of frustration of awards. Ecuador does not dispute that the ordinary meaning of \u201cmanifest\u201d is \u201cobvious\u201d or \u201c[c]learly revealed to the eye, mind, or judgement.\u201d If a legal point requires extensive argumentation and analysis, then is not an obvious one.62\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 26.\n\n89.\n\nEcuador's argument that an error need not be serious to be manifest is also unavailing. Minor or inconsequential errors do not undermine the ICSID system's integrity so should not be annullable. Ecuador also ignores committee consensus that a \u201cmanifest\u201d excess of powers is one that is both \u201ctextually obvious and substantively serious.\u201d Although Ecuador states that the *Soufraki* committee did not take a position on whether \u2018manifest' means \u2018serious' in addition to \u2018obvious', said committee clearly stated that the excess of powers \u201cshould at once be textually obvious and substantively serious.\u201d63\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 28.\n\n90.\n\nFinally, Perenco does not agree with Ecuador that the \u201cmanifest\u201d requirement must be determined only after first assessing whether there has been an excess of powers. The reverse approach is more efficient and more consistent with the proposition that an excess of powers must be obvious to satisfy annulment.64\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 29.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nBoth Parties agree that two requirements must be fulfilled to meet the threshold of Article 52(1)(b): (i) that the tribunal exceeded the scope of its powers and (ii) that such excess of powers was manifest.65\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 189.\n\n92.\n\nAn excess of powers occurs when, for instance, a tribunal goes beyond the scope of the Parties' arbitration agreement, decides points which had not been submitted to it, or fails to apply the law agreed to by the Parties.66 In the case at hand, the Parties focus the debate on the Tribunal's alleged \u201cexcess of jurisdiction\u201d and its alleged failure to apply the proper law.67\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 81.\n\nIn the Introduction to its Memorial on Annulment (\u00b6 12), Ecuador manifests that: \u201cthe Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers when it made various *ultra petita* decisions. A telling illustration is the Tribunal's decision to apply a post-award interest rate even higher than the risk-free rate claimed by Perenco and its economic expert.\u201d The Committee observes, however, that Ecuador did not elaborate on why and how an *ultra* or *extra petita* decision is an excess of powers.\n\n93.\n\nAs regards the scope of the arbitration agreement, *ad hoc* committees have held that there may be an excess of powers if a tribunal incorrectly concludes that it has jurisdiction when it lacks thereof, or when the Tribunal exceeds the scope of its jurisdiction. Likewise, a Tribunal's rejection of jurisdiction when jurisdiction exists also amounts to an excess of powers.68\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 87.\n\n94.\n\nUnder the principle of *comp\u00e9tence de la comp\u00e9tence*, a tribunal is the judge of its own competence and has the power to determine whether it has jurisdiction under the parties' arbitration agreement. ICSID annulment proceedings do not avail for a *de novo* review of jurisdiction. That would be tantamount to an appeal. As explained by Prof. Schreuer, \u201cthe stability of the system could be threatened if an *ad hoc* committee could simply substitute its view on jurisdiction for that of the tribunal.\u201d69\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention \u2013 A Commentary (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, \u00b6 148 (CAA-067).\n\n95.\n\nAs regards the failure to apply the law agreed to by the Parties, the Parties differ on whether a gross misapplication or misinterpretation of the law amounts to a non-application of the law. On the one hand, the Applicant advances its case in favor of said position. On the other hand, the Claimant contends that as long as the Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and endeavored to apply it, it cannot have exceeded its powers.70\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.\n\n96.\n\nThe Committee considers that under the limited scope of Article 52(1)(b), it cannot annul an award based on the fact that it has a different understanding of the facts, interpretation of the law, or appreciation of the evidence from that of the Tribunal.71 By so doing, a committee would be acting as a court of appeals; it would be reviewing the substance of the Tribunal's decision. In this regard, the Legal Committee of the ICSID Convention confirmed that even a \u201c\u2018manifestly incorrect application of the law' is not a ground for annulment.\u201d72 Accordingly, the Committee is of the view that the applicable standard of review is whether the Tribunal correctly identified and endeavored to apply the law agreed to by the Parties.73 It is not for an *ad hoc* committee to determine whether there was a misapplication or misinterpretation of the law agreed to by the parties or whether such misapplication or misinterpretation was gross or minor. This would imply an unacceptable intromission on the merits of the Tribunal's decision, not permitted by the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Award, November 27, 2013, \u00b6 175 (CAA-097).\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 72.\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 21.\n\n97.\n\nThe Parties further dispute whether the Committee's review of the Tribunal's application of the law must be \u201cobjective\u201d rather than \u201csubjective.\u201d Regardless of the academic debate between the Parties on the contours of the terms \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201csubjective,\u201d the Committee considers that its duty is to analyze whether *in fact* the Tribunal properly identified the body of law as agreed by the Parties and endeavored to apply that law. For such purpose, the Committee must undertake an assessment of the Award, the Treaty, and the relevant documents in the Underlying Arbitration.\n\n98.\n\nAs to the requirement that a tribunal's excess of power be manifest, the Applicant contends that such requirement refers to how apparent the excess is, rather than to its gravity. The Claimant argues, in turn, that an excess of powers must be both textually obvious and substantively serious to qualify as manifest. The Committee considers that, in principle, the word \u201cmanifest\u201d is to be interpreted under its ordinary meaning: something that is clear, patent, or apparent to the eye. However, the analysis does not stop there. In the light of the object and purpose of the annulment remedy, that is to safeguard the integrity of ICSID proceedings, the Committee considers that \u201cmanifest\u201d also encompasses a substantive element. Thus, on the one hand, minor or inconsequential errors that do not undermine the integrity of the ICSID system should not be annullable; on the other hand, and as stated above, a superficial analysis or reading of the award is not sufficient to determine whether the excess is manifest.\n\n99.\n\nThe Committee further notes that the excess of powers has to be \u201cmanifest\u201d for the members of an *ad hoc* committee that ought to be constituted by qualified persons with \u201c[\u2026] competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry, or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment,\u201d74 not to anyone that may read the Award. Therefore, an *ad hoc* committee may need to review complex facts and legal issues to determine whether an error is tantamount to a manifest excess of powers. The extent and complexity of such review depends on the circumstances of each case.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 14.\n\n**C. S****erious** **D****eparture from a** **F****undamental rule of** **P****rocedure**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n**a. Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n100.\n\nEcuador refers to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. It provides for the annulment of an award when \u201cthere has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\u201d Ecuador presents the following analysis:\n\n101.\n\nTo analyze whether there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, a three-prong test applies: (i) the procedural rule must be fundamental, (ii) the Tribunal must have departed from it, and (iii) the departure must have been serious.\n\n102.\n\nAs to the fundamental rules of procedure, the Applicant contends that these are \u201cprocedural rules that are essential to the integrity of the arbitral process.\u201d Such rules form a \u201cset of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law.\u201d75 In its Background Paper on Annulment, the ICSID Secretariat refers to a set of examples of these rules identified by *ad hoc* committees, such as: equal treatment of the Parties, the right to be heard, an independent and impartial Tribunal, treatment of evidence and burden of proof, and the deliberations among members of the Tribunal.76\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 208.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 208-213.\n\n103.\n\nAs to the departure, Ecuador advances that a tribunal departs from a fundamental procedural rule when, in the exercise of its discretion, it overlooks due process and procedural fairness. Such departure occurs when, for example, a tribunal awards damages resulting from a treaty breach despite the parties never pleaded such damages, or when a tribunal admits new evidence submitted by one party after the closure of the proceedings without giving the other party an opportunity to rebut it, as recognized by the *ad hoc* committees in *Pey Casado* and *Fraport*.77\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 214-215.\n\n104.\n\nAs to the seriousness of the departure, the Applicant claims that \u201cto constitute a serious departure, the fundamental rule must have been flouted in a significant way that deprived the rule of its intended effect.\u201d In the same vein, Ecuador notes that *ad hoc* committees \u201chave considered that a \u2018serious' departure is one which causes the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from that which it would have reached had such a rule been observed.\u201d78\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 216.\n\n105.\n\nFinally, the Applicant argues that a serious departure from a fundamental procedural rule need not be manifest, nor it has to be outcome determinative for it to be serious. Such analysis would be a highly speculative exercise for an *ad hoc* committee to undertake. \u201cRather than assessing whether the outcome of the proceeding would have been different, the *ad hoc* committee's task is to determine \u2018whether the tribunal's compliance with a rule of procedure could potentially have affected the award.'\u201d79\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 217-221.\n\n106.\n\nEcuador further claims that Perenco makes at least three errors in its presentation of the standard of \u201cserious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\u201d\n\n107.\n\nFirst, as regards the \u201cright to be heard,\u201d Perenco quotes Prof. Schreuer for the proposition that a tribunal is not \u201cprecluded from adopting legal reasoning that was not put forward by one of the parties without first seeking the parties' opinion.\u201d Perenco, however, fails to mention that this proposition is not without exceptions. As noted by the committee in *TECO*, \u201c[o]ne such exception is when a tribunal effectively surprises the parties with an issue that neither party has invoked, argued or reasonably could have anticipated during the proceedings.\u201d80 Therefore, \u201cwhen a tribunal relies on a concept that is in fact \u2018surprising' and has not \u2018been discussed by the parties' it could infringe the parties' right to be heard.\u201d81\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 76.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 78.\n\n108.\n\nSecond, Perenco claims that a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure must have been \u201coutcome-determinative.\u201d This approach, however, has been rejected by committees for being highly speculative and impractical. As noted by the committee in *Pey Casado I* it is sufficient to ascertain that had the tribunal observed the fundamental procedural rule, \u201cthere is a distinct possibility (a \u2018chance') that it may have made a difference on a critical issue,\u201d or, as expressed by the committee in *TECO*, that compliance with the rule \u201ccould potentially have affected the award.\u201d82 This position has also been recently adopted by the *Eiser* committee.83\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 80.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 81.\n\n109.\n\nThird, Perenco asserts that \u201ca party cannot seek annulment on the grounds of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure if it failed to promptly raise that alleged departure before the tribunal.\u201d Perenco, however, neglects to mention a key condition for the application of this rule: that the \u201cobjecting party must know of the conduct of the tribunal and have a reasonable opportunity to raise its objection.\u201d As expressed by the committee in *Fraport*, \u201c[\u2026] a party cannot be treated as having waived an objection to a course of action of which it was unaware.\u201d84\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 82.\n\n**b. Perenco's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n110.\n\nAccording to Perenco, Ecuador fails to acknowledge key limitations on annulment on the basis of a \u201cserious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\u201d under Article 52(1)(d).85\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 94.\n\n111.\n\nFirst, it is uncontroversial that the right to be heard and the right to equal treatment are fundamental procedural rules. Yet, \u201cthe right to be heard entails a reasonable and fair opportunity to present one's case, not an absolute and unlimited one.\u201d Tribunals are not required to give express consideration to every argument advanced by the Parties; moreover, when they decline to consider an issue that they deemed irrelevant.86\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 95.\n\n112.\n\nSecond, \u201ccontrary to Ecuador's position, the right to be heard does not constrain the tribunal to adopt wholesale either one party's arguments or the other's, without conducting its own analysis.\u201d Perenco refers to Prof. Schreuer's observations on this matter to support87 its position.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 96.\n\n113.\n\nThird, a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure must be \u201cserious.\u201d Therefore, overlooking due process and procedural fairness is not enough to satisfy Article 52(1)(b). Furthermore, Ecuador's position that the Tribunal's position need not be outcome determinative counters its own admission that in order to qualify as \u201cserious,\u201d \u201cthe departure must have \u2018deprived the rule of its intended effect' and \u2018cause[d] the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from that which it would have reached' had it observed the rule.\u201d88\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 97.\n\n114.\n\nPerenco claims that a party cannot seek annulment on the grounds of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure if it failed to promptly raise the alleged departure before the tribunal. It is not enough for a Party to simply state that it is reserving its rights without actually bringing the alleged procedural defect to the Tribunal's attention only to attack the award later in annulment proceedings.89\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 98-99.\n\n115.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Annulment, Perenco asserts that Ecuador's position that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure does not identify a breach of due process. Instead, seven out of eight of Ecuador's alleged instances of a serious departure from a fundamental rule seek to fault the Tribunal for not having engaged in an additional process that the Tribunal had no obligation to provide and would have paralyzed proceedings if adopted, namely giving Ecuador advance notice of the Tribunal's findings.90\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 44.\n\n116.\n\nEcuador's complaints are simply that it disagrees with the Tribunal's analysis and thinks it should have had a chance to say so and change the Tribunal's mind. That amounts, in essence, to a complaint that the Tribunal did not expressly tell the Parties what its Award would say before issuing it. But even Ecuador concedes that the Tribunal could adopt its own reasoning on the points submitted for decision and was not limited to accepting either one or the other Party's view. Ecuador therefore resorts to claiming that the Tribunal could not adopt its own legal reasoning when to do so would \u201ceffectively surprise the parties,\u201d91\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 45.\n\n117.\n\nPerenco adds that \u201c[a]dopting Ecuador's formulation\u2014that all it has to show is that there is a \u2018distinct possibility' that the departure affected the outcome of the Award\u2014would mean diluting the express terms of the ICSID Convention that the departure from the fundamental rule of procedure must be \u2018serious.'\u201d127 \u201cThe only reason Ecuador provides for its disregard of the language of the ICSID Convention\u2014that some committees have found the \u2018outcome-determinative' test \u2018impractical to apply'\u2014cannot justify departing from the express terms of Article 52(1)(d), more so when many *ad hoc* committees have applied that test.\u201d In *OI European Group*, for example, the committee refused to find a serious departure. Even the decisions on which Ecuador relies do not support its case.92\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 48.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Parties agree that to determine whether there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure two requirements must be met: (i) the procedural rule must be fundamental, and (ii) the departure from the fundamental rule of procedure must be serious.\n\n119.\n\nIn relation to the fundamental character of the procedural rules, the drafters of the ICSID Convention understood that such rules are principles concerned with the integrity and fairness of the arbitral process,93 not ordinary arbitration rules. Article 52(1)(d) refers to procedural rules which may constitute \u201cgeneral principles of law\u201d, insofar as these rules involve international arbitration procedure.94\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 98.\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 186-187 (AALA-079).\n\n120.\n\n*Ad hoc* committees have identified examples of fundamental procedural rules, including: (i) the equal treatment of the Parties; (ii) the right to be heard; (iii) an independent and impartial Tribunal; (iv) the treatment of evidence and burden of proof; and (v) the deliberations among members of the Tribunal.95\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, \u00b6 99.\n\n121.\n\nThe Parties discussed at length the scope and contours of the \u201cright to be heard\u201d.\n\n122.\n\nAs regards the right to be heard, the *Fraport* committee noted that said right is the right to present one's case, including the right to reply or comment on new evidence, the alteration of the legal basis of a claim, or the amendment of an original submission. This procedural rule also includes the right to a fair hearing.96\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 195-199 (AALA-079).\n\n123.\n\nSimilarly, the *Wena* committee concluded that the \u201cright to be heard\u201d includes the right to state its claims or its defence and to produce all the arguments and evidence to support its position. This \u201cfundamental right has to be ensured on an equal level, in a way that allows each party to respond adequately to the argument and evidence presented by the other.\u201d97\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Annulment Proceeding, February 5, 2002, \u00b6 57 (AALA-046); *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007, \u00b6 50 (AALA-076).\n\n124.\n\nThe Parties focus their discussion on the right to be heard on two main points: (i) whether tribunals are required to give express consideration to every argument advanced by the parties;98 and (ii) whether the right to be heard constrains a tribunal to base its analysis on arguments forwarded by one or the other party.\n\nThe Committee observes that in its assessment on the standards of annulment, Ecuador raises this issue solely with respect to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. However, in the specific grounds on annulment, Ecuador raises this issue also under Article 52(1)(e). The Committee considers that its analysis of whether tribunals are required to give express consideration to every argument advanced by the Parties is applicable indistinctly if the issue is raised under Article 52(1)(d) or under Article 52(1)(e). Thus, it must be understood that the analysis conducted by the Committee as of paragraph 121 is also part of its analysis of the \u201cfailure to state reasons\u201d ground for annulment.\n\n125.\n\nAs to the first point, the Committee observes that Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention states that \u201c[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\u201d This provision does not envisage that the Award shall address every argument, piece of evidence, or fact presented by the Parties. A Tribunal is therefore not obliged to give express consideration to every argument or issue raised by the Parties to guarantee their right to be heard. As concluded by the *Azurix* committee, \u201cit is not a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure for a tribunal to decline to consider an issue that it considers to be irrelevant, merely because one of the parties considers it to be important.\u201d99 Nonetheless, the Committee considers that a failure to consider a question or a point raised by a Party that is critical to the Tribunal's decision may, in certain cases, amount to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.100\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. the Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Annulment, September 1, 2009, \u00b6 244 (CAA-068).\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Decision on the Application for Partial Annulment of Continental Casualty Company and the Application for Partial Annulment of the Argentine Republic, September 16, 2011, \u00b6 97 (AALA-089).\n\n126.\n\nAs to the second point, the Committee observes that a tribunal does not necessarily depart from the right to be heard by not adopting either of the positions raised by the Parties. A tribunal may conduct its own analysis based on the documents, evidence, pleadings, and legal authorities presented by the Parties and reach a conclusion different from the positions submitted by the Parties. In its Commentary to the ICSID Convention, Prof. Schreuer states that:\n\n[The right to be heard] principle does not mean that it is the tribunal's task to draw the parties' attention to an aspect of a legal question that they may have failed to address. Nor is the tribunal precluded from adopting legal reasoning that was not put forward by one of the parties without first seeking the parties' opinion.101\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention \u2013 A Commentary (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, \u00b6 317 (CAA-067).\n\n127.\n\nA similar position has been adopted by the *Kl\u00f6ckner I* and *Caratube I* committees, concluding that a tribunal does not violate the parties' right to be heard if they ground their decision on legal reasoning not specifically argued by the parties, insofar as the tribunal's reasoning can be fitted within the legal framework argued during the procedure.102 In case that the tribunal prefers to use a distinct legal framework, or to bring attention to other issues not raised by the parties, the tribunal shall give an opportunity to the parties to comment on such new legal framework. Likewise, a decision may be considered *ultra petita* when a tribunal decides on issues that were not pleaded by the parties.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner v. Republic of Cameroon*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment submitted by Kl\u00f6ckner, May 3, 1985, \u00b6 91 (AALA-049); *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision on the Annulment Application of Caratube International Oil Company LLP, February 21, 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 92-93 (AALA-059).\n\n128.\n\nTo the Committee's knowledge, in only two cases an award has been annulled under Article 52(1)(d) as a result of a breach to the \u201cright to be heard\u201d: *Fraport* and *Amco II*.\n\n129.\n\nIn *Fraport*, the committee decided to annul the tribunal's finding that the investment was not made in accordance with the applicable Philippine law and therefore that it lacked jurisdiction under the treaty. The committee found (i) that the tribunal's decision was largely based on documents submitted by the respondent after the procedure was officially closed\u2014and not re-opened\u2014, and (ii) that the parties were not allowed to comment on such documents. The committee held that the tribunal's conduct was incompatible with its fundamental obligation to allow both parties to present their case in relation to the new material. The tribunal should not have considered the said documents in its deliberations \u201cwithout having afforded the parties the opportunity to make submissions on it, and availed itself of the benefit of those submissions.\u201d103\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 230-231 (AALA-079).\n\n130.\n\nIn *Amco II*, the committee annulled the tribunal's supplemental decision to the award because the tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. The committee concluded that the tribunal neither fixed a time limit for Indonesia's submission on Amco's request for a supplementary decision, nor did it give reasons in the supplementary award for not doing so. The committee considered that by so doing, the tribunal disregarded Rule 49(3) of the Arbitration Rules, providing that \u201c[t]he Tribunal shall fix a time limit for the parties to file their observations on the request and shall determine the procedure for its consideration.\u201d The committee concluded that such rule was fundamental because it provided an opportunity for both parties to present its case equally. The committee further determined that the departure from said fundamental rule was serious because the tribunal simply ignored it without even acknowledging its existence in the supplementary decision. Accordingly, the committee concluded that Indonesia was deprived of the benefit of the protection the rule is intended to provide, and therefore, it annulled the supplementary award.104\n\n*Amco Asia Corp. and Others v. Republic of Indonesia* (\u201cAmco II\u201d), ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Annulment of Award of June 5, 1990 and of Supplemental Award of October 17, 1990, December 3, 1992, \u00b6\u00b6 9.05-9.10 (AALA-074).\n\n131.\n\nIn relation to the \u201cseriousness\u201d of the departure, the Parties debate on whether the departure from the fundamental procedural rule must have a material impact on the outcome of the case to be considered \u201cserious\u201d.\n\n132.\n\nFor Ecuador, an *ad hoc* committee's task is to determine whether the tribunal's compliance with a rule of procedure could potentially have affected the award. To the contrary, Perenco considers that the departure must have caused the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from that which it would have reached had it observed the rule.105\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 97.\n\n133.\n\nThe Committee considers that for a departure from a procedural rule to be serious, it must have deprived the rule of its intended effect.106 Yet, to conclude that the departure is serious, the Committee need not determine if the outcome of the decision would have been different. Such analysis would be highly speculative. Thus, in the Committee's view, a breach is serious if the Tribunal's decision would have been *potentially* different had the breach not been committed.107\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v.

Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23, Decision on Annulment, September 5, 2016, \u00b6 85 (AALA-085).\n\n135.\n\nIn this regard, the *Occidental* committee noted\u2014and the Committee shares its view\u2014that:\n\nTo require an applicant to prove that the award would have been different had the rule of procedure been observed, may impose an unrealistically high burden of proof. Where a complex decision depends on a number of factors, it is almost impossible to prove with certainty whether the change of one parameter would have altered the outcome.114\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment, November 2, 2015, \u00b6 62 (AALA-061).\n\n136.\n\nLikewise, the Committee is persuaded by the *ad hoc* committee's reasoning in *CEAC v. Montenegro* that:\n\nRequiring an applicant to show that it would have won the case or that the result of the case would have been different if the rule of procedure had been respected is a highly speculative exercise. An annulment committee cannot determine with any degree of certainty whether any of these results would have occurred without placing itself in the shoes of a tribunal, something which it is not within its powers to do. What a committee can determine however is whether the tribunal's compliance with a rule of procedure could potentially have affected the award.115\n\n*CEAC Holdings Limited v. Montenegro*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/8, Decision on Annulment, May 1, 2018, \u00b6 93 (AALA-077).\n\n137.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee considers that for a departure to be serious it need not be outcome determinative in the sense that the Applicant has to demonstrate that the Tribunal's decision would have been different had the fundamental procedural rule been observed. The Applicant, however, has the burden to demonstrate that there is a distinct possibility that the departure may have made a difference on a critical issue of the Tribunal's decision.\n\n138.\n\nFinally, the Parties dispute whether a Party can seek annulment on the grounds of Article 52(1)(d) if it failed to promptly raise the alleged departure before the Tribunal. Perenco argues that a simple \u201creservation of rights\u201d is not enough, as opposition must be express. Ecuador contends, in turn, that \u201c[\u2026] a party cannot be treated as having waived an objection to a course of action of which it was unaware.\u201d116\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 82.\n\n139.\n\nThe Committee remarks that pursuant to Arbitration Rule 27, if a party is aware of a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and does not positively oppose such violation, it waives its right to object it, and thereby to request the annulment on such basis.117 However, some violations of procedural rules may become visible only after the tribunal has rendered the award, and therefore, the concerned party is not estopped from requesting annulment on that basis. As explained by Prof. Schreuer:\n\nSome violations of procedural principles will be evident to the affected party in the proceeding before the tribunal. Others may become visible only after the award has become available. A party that is aware of a violation of proper procedure must react immediately by stating its objection and by demanding compliance.118\n\nSee Rules 27 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention \u2013 A Commentary (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, \u00b6 334 (CAA-067).\n\n140.\n\nIn like manner, the *ad hoc* committee in *Fraport* concluded that:\n\n[A] party forfeits its right to seek annulment under Article 52(1)(d) if it has failed promptly to raise its objection to the tribunal's procedure, upon becoming aware of it. [\u2026] However, if such a principle is to be invoked so as to preclude a party from its right to seek annulment for an otherwise serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure by the tribunal, the objecting party must know of the conduct of the tribunal and have a reasonable opportunity to raise its objection. This point is, in the view of the Committee, an elementary one, since a party cannot be treated as having waived an objection to a course of action of which it was unaware.119\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v.

F****ailure to** **S****tate** **R****easons**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n**a. Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n142.\n\nEcuador submits that Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention provides for the annulment of an award in the event that it \u201chas failed to state the reasons on which it is based\u201d and presents the following arguments:\n\n143.\n\nIt is a tribunal's duty to state the reasons leading to its decision. An award is deemed to have failed to state the reasons on which it is based when the reasons stated do not allow the reader to follow the reasoning of the tribunal, that is, when the sequence of arguments within an award does not put forth \u201ca logical chain of reasoning that is apt to lead to the conclusion that was reached by the tribunal.\u201d According to the Applicant, there are three main ways in which an award fails to state the reasons on which is based.\n\n144.\n\nFirst, an award does not enable the reader to follow a tribunal's reasoning if it provides no reasons altogether or if it fails to provide reasons for one particular aspect of the award.122\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 228.\n\n145.\n\nSecond, an award does not enable the reader to follow a tribunal's reasoning if the stated reasons are so contradictory as to cancel each other out, thereby resulting in no reasoning. This is so, for instance, \u201cwhere the basis for a tribunal's decision on one question is the existence of fact A, when the basis for its decision on another question is the non-existence of fact A.\u201d123\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 230.\n\n146.\n\nThird, an award does not enable the reader to follow a tribunal's reasoning if the reasons that are provided are \u201cfrivolous,\u201d that is when they are \u201cmanifestly irrelevant and knowingly so to the tribunal,\u201d or \u201ccannot logically explain the decision they are purportedly supporting.\u201d Insufficient and inadequate reasons may also be frivolous.124\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 231.\n\n147.\n\nEcuador contends that Perenco misconstrues the ground on failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based in five ways:\n\n148.\n\nFirst, Perenco insists that the reasoning requirement is \u201ca minimum standard\u201d that must be subject to \u201cstrict\u201d review and the \u201cthreshold for annulment is high.\u201d Yet, these assertions have no basis in the text of Article 52(1)(e), and they obscure the provision's object and purpose. Ecuador remarks that such \u201crestrictive\u201d approach was rejected by the committee in *Tenaris II* by refusing to deprive the provision of its *effet utile*.125\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 58.\n\n149.\n\nSecond, Perenco states that any assessment of quality of the Award. \u201cshades easily into an appeal.\u201d Yet, this position ignores that *ad hoc* committees have established criteria for objectively determining whether a tribunal's purported statement of reasons amounts to a failure to state reasons. For instance, when reasoning is \u201cfrivolous\u201d, i.e. \u201cmanifestly irrelevant and knowingly so to the tribunal,\u201d and \u201cso flawed that it amounts to no reasons at all;\u201d or when reasoning is inadequate, that is to say that it \u201ccannot logically explain the decision [it is] purportedly supporting.\u201d126 Perenco quotes the annulment decisions in *Tidewater* and *Tenaris II* out of context; read as a whole, none of these decisions support its position.127 Accordingly, assessing the quality of a tribunal's reasoning is required to ensure that such reasoning is not so flawed that it amounts to no reasons at all.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 61.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.\n\n150.\n\nThird, Perenco claims that the Committee should \u201cseek to understand the motivation of the Award in the light of the record before the Tribunal,\u201d \u201cprefer an interpretation that confirms an award's consistency,\u201d and even \u201cinfer or reconstruct implicit reasons for a decision from the terms of the award and the record before the tribunal.\u201d This is impermissible under Article 52(1)(e) for at least three reasons: (i) no presumption in favor of the validity of the Award exists; (ii) the exercise of reconstructing the Award defeats the object and purpose of Article 52(1)(e); and (iii) there is a tension between the arguments advanced by Perenco: on the one hand it advocates for a proactive role of the Committee for reconstructing the reasoning in the Award, and on the other hand, it endorses a hands-off approach to annulment.128\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 67-70.\n\n151.\n\nFourth, Perenco attempts to minimize the extent of the reasoning requirement by stating that the failure to state reasons must affect an issue necessary to the Tribunal's decision or essential to the outcome of the case. Yet, to give a fully reasoned award, a tribunal is required to answer every \u201cquestion\u201d put to it. While a tribunal need not deal explicitly with every detail of every argument advanced by the parties or refer to every authority which they invoke, it must deal with every relevant argument; in particular, arguments that might affect the outcome of the case, as well as those in which a Party \u2018has a major interest' in seeing them resolved.129\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 72.\n\n152.\n\nFinally, Perenco appears to confuse the reasoning requirement with the right to be heard within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d). \u201cWhether or not a failure to address every question submitted to it is also a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure does not change\n\nthe fact that it is unequivocally a failure to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e).\u201d130\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 73.\n\n**b. Perenco's Position**\n-------------------------\n\n153.\n\nAccording to Perenco, Ecuador \u201cimproperly attempts to turn an award that \u2018has failed to state the reasons on which it is based' into an award that *has* stated reasons, but one party finds them \u2018insufficient and inadequate.'\u201d131\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 84.\n\n154.\n\nFirst, Ecuador acknowledges that Article 52(1)(e) is concerned with the existence of reasons, rather with the quality of such reasons. This is confirmed by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention. *Ad hoc* committees have held that Article 52(1)(e) is a minimum standard intended to ensure that a reasonable reader may understand the award, and that the scope of review under Article 52(1)(e) is strict and the threshold for annulment is high. Two conditions must be fulfilled for an annulment to be warranted under this ground: \u201cfirst, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision.\u201d132\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 85-87.\n\n155.\n\nPerenco observes that Ecuador's objections are not premised on the minimum standard provided by Article 52(1)(e) \u201cto ensure that a reasonable reader may understand the award.\u201d \u201cThrough its repeated assertions that \u201cfrivolous\u201d and \u201cinadequate\u201d reasons are annullable, Ecuador is trying to force this Committee to second-guess the Tribunal by reviewing not whether the Tribunal provided reasons, but rather the quality of the reasons it provided.\u201d133 There is no dispute that the Tribunal must state reasons, but it need not meet the high gauntlet Ecuador tries to raise.134 Perenco further remarks that Ecuador's attacks to the decisions Perenco relies on as regards this matter (*Tidewater* and *Tenaris II*) are misguided.135\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 33.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 34.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 36.\n\n156.\n\nSecond, Ecuador is wrong that stating reasons that are \u201cinsufficient and inadequate\u201d amount to a failure to state reasons. Ecuador supports its position almost exclusively on the 35-year-old *Kl\u00f6ckner I* annulment decision, which has been criticized for improperly drawing *ad hoc* committees into a review of the substance of arbitral decisions. Although Ecuador recognizes that committees must \u201cavoid an approach which would result in the qualification of a tribunal's reasoning as deficient, superficial, sub-standard, wrong, bad or otherwise faulty,\u201d it qualifies the Tribunal's reasoning as \u201cfrivolous,\u201d \u201carbitrary,\u201d \u201cgross,\u201d etc. Conceptually, there is no distinction between assessing whether reasons are \u201cfrivolous\u201d or whether they are \u201cinadequate.\u201d Both are quality assessments. Contrary to Ecuador's position, Article 52(1)(e) concerns the \u201cabsence\u201d or \u201cessential lack\u201d of any reasons. Such reasons may be implicit and inferred from the decision.136 Accordingly, \u201can award is not subject to annulment if the Committee can infer implicit reasons for a decision from the terms of the Award and the record before the Tribunal\u201d.137\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 88-90.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 42.\n\n157.\n\nEven if the Committee were to apply Ecuador's standard of review and assess whether the Tribunal's reasoning was \u201cfrivolous,\u201d \u201cthe few [c]ommittees that have\u2014incorrectly\u2014 endorsed a \u2018frivolous' standard emphasize that the threshold under Article 52(1)(e) is \u2018very high' and that \u2018frivolous' reasons are not \u2018incorrect or unconvincing reasons.'\u201d138 In fact, \u201cnone of the decisions Ecuador cites as endorsing the \u2018frivolous' test annulled the award because the reasoning was \u2018frivolous' or \u2018inadequate.'\u201d139\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 37.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 37.\n\n158.\n\nThird, Perenco notes that only \u201cgenuinely contradictory\u201d reasons that are \u201cincapable of standing together on any reasonable reading\u201d give rise to an annullable error. Yet, such circumstances are extremely rare. Reasoning that reflects conflicting considerations or a compromise is not genuinely contradictory. Moreover, as recognized by *ad hoc* committees, \u201cin reviewing the apparent contradictions, the *ad hoc* committee should, to the extent possible and considering each case, prefer an interpretation which confirms an award's consistency as opposed to its alleged inner contradictions.\u201d140\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 91.\n\n159.\n\nFinally, Ecuador fails to mention that, as recognized by *ad hoc* committees, the failure to state reasons must affect an issue \u201cnecessary to the tribunal's decision\u201d or \u201cessential to the outcome of the case.\u201d Perenco refers to the annulment decision in *Venezuela Holdings* and *Adem Dogan*, which addressed decisions on jurisdiction.141\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 92.\n\n160.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Annulment, Perenco objects Ecuador's argument \u201cthat the Tribunal must have provided reasons for each and every point the parties disputed\u201d. Perenco claims that annulment cases have overwhelmingly confirmed that \u201ca tribunal need only provide reasons for its decisions, and not reasons for its reasons.\u201d142 In fact, \u201ceven the cases on which Ecuador relies agree with this principle\u201d.143 Perenco further opposes Ecuador's proposition that a tribunal should state its reasons for issues \u201cin which a party \u2018has a major interest' in seeing resolved,\u201d as it ignores that Article 52(1)(e) requires only that an award be reasoned, not that an award be satisfactory to all parties.144\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 38.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 40.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 41.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that a statement of reasons for a judicial or an arbitral decision is fundamental for adjudication of justice, particularly in ICSID arbitration. \u201cThe purpose of a statement of reasons is to explain to the reader of the award, especially to the parties, how and why the tribunal reached its decision in the light of the facts and the applicable law.\u201d145 Arbitral tribunals have thereby the duty to identify and let the parties know the factual and legal premises leading to their decision.146 Under the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal's duty to state reasons for its decision is provided in Article 48(3). A violation to this requirement is embodied as a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention \u2013 A Commentary (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, \u00b6 363 (CAA-067).\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Application for Annulment, January 28, 2002, \u00b6 79 (AALA-046).\n\n162.\n\nThe drafting history of the ICSID Convention shows that \u201cthe tribunal's obligation to state reasons is mandatory and not subject to the parties' disposition.\u201d147 Therefore, an agreement contrary to the Tribunal's duty to provide reasons would be invalid and would not preclude a subsequent application for annulment on this ground.148\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention \u2013 A Commentary (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 339-340 (CAA-067).\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention \u2013 A Commentary (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, \u00b6 340 (CAA-067).\n\n163.\n\nThe Committee observes that the core of the dispute between the Parties is whether a failure to state reasons takes place when there are no reasons at all supporting a tribunal's reasoning, or whether \u201cfrivolous\u201d or \u201ccontradictory\u201d reasons may be tantamount to a failure to state reasons. The Parties also dispute whether implicit reasons are considered \u201creasons\u201d within the scope of Article 52(1)(e).\n\n164.\n\nIn the first place, the Committee stresses that Article 52(1)(e) does not concern the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. As correctly noted by the *CDC v. Seychelles* committee \u201cthe more recent practice among *ad hoc* Committees is to apply Article 52(1)(e) in such a manner that the Committee does not intrude into the legal and factual decision-making of the Tribunal.\u201d149 It is not on an *ad hoc* committee to assess the quality, extension, or correctness of the reasons provided by a tribunal, much less to annul an award on that basis. If a tribunal provides reasons on how and why it reached its decision, there is no room for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n*CDC Group plc v. The Republic of Seychelles*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, June 29, 2005, \u00b6 70 (AALA-081).\n\n165.\n\nFurthermore, as recognized in the *Amco II* annulment, \u201cnot every gap or ambiguity in a judgment constitutes a failure to state reasons.\u201d150 \u201cStatements have to be read in context. The \u2018reasons' for a position or a statement may be found in the developments that follow.\u201d151 This observation is of particular relevance in the case at hand given that the Award is constituted by five Decisions, plus a Decision on Provisional Measures. To determine whether the Tribunal failed to state the reasons that led to its decisions, the Committee must read the Award in context.\n\n*Amco Asia Corp. and Others v. Republic of Indonesia* (\u201cAmco II\u201d), ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Annulment of Award of June 5, 1990 and of Supplemental Award of October 17, 1990, December 3, 1992, \u00b6 7.56 (AALA-074).\n\n*Amco Asia Corp. and Others v. Republic of Indonesia* (\u201cAmco II\u201d), ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Annulment of Award of June 5, 1990 and of Supplemental Award of October 17, 1990, December 3, 1992, \u00b6 7.57 (AALA-074).\n\n166.\n\nAs regards the issue of implicit reasons, the Committee observes that the premises leading to a decision may be either implicit or explicit. What is paramount is that the Tribunal's conclusions follow from a set of premises. Furthermore, as noted by the committee in *Wena*:\n\nNeither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal's reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the Parties will be able to understand the Tribunal's reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The Tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.152\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Annulment Proceeding, February 5, 2002, \u00b6 81 (AALA-046).\n\n167.\n\nAs regards the issue of \u201cfrivolous\u201d reasons, the Committee is of the view that irrelevant or absurd arguments apparently supporting a conclusion do not amount to reasons.153 The determination on whether an argument is \u201cfrivolous\u201d depends on the circumstances of each case.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention \u2013 A Commentary (2nd ed.), Cambridge University Press 2009, \u00b6 344 (CAA-067).\n\n168.\n\nAs regards the issue of \u201cnon-contradictory reasons,\u201d *ad hoc* committees have considered that contradictory reasons might result in annulment under Article 52(1)(e).154 Some committees have concluded that for there to be a \u201cfailure to state reasons\u201d, the reasons must be so contradictory that they \u201ccancel each other out.\u201d155\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki, June 5, 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 122-126 (AALA-039).\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner v. Republic of Cameroon*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment submitted by Kl\u00f6ckner, May 3, 1985, \u00b6 116 (AALA-049). *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, March 25, 2010, \u00b6 82 (AALA-086); *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for Annulment of the Award rendered on August 20, 2007, August 10, 2010, \u00b6 65 (CAA-070).\n\n169.\n\nThe Committee considers that although contradictory reasons could amount to a failure to state reasons, such assessment should not be one of coherence of the Tribunal's reasoning. That approach could easily derive in an assessment of the quality of the Tribunal's reasons. For the Committee, a failure to state reasons may take place when two (or more) contradictory premises supporting a conclusion cannot stand together and cannot both be true. Furthermore, such failure must be critical to the Tribunal's decision. The fact that a tribunal fails to state reasons on a minor and inconsequential issue is not enough to annul an award or a part thereof under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n170.\n\nIn sum, a decision is reasoned when the Tribunal's conclusions clearly follow from a set of either express or implicit premises. If there are no reasons supporting a conclusion, or a conclusion is based on contradictory premises, an award or any part thereof is annullable under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**IV. THE SPECIFIC GROUNDS ON ANNULMENT**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nIn the Annulment Application, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Award or parts of it under twenty-one (21) \u201cspecific grounds on annulment\u201d. Ecuador claims that twenty-one of the Tribunal's findings in the Award or the Decisions should be annulled under one or more grounds provided in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n172.\n\nBoth in the Memorial on Annulment and the Reply on Annulment, the Applicant raised twenty (20) specific grounds on annulment; it did not include the specific ground raised in the Annulment Application titled: \u201cThe Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it decided that the notion of environmental harm is defined by reference to permissible limits.\u201d156 Likewise, at the Hearing, Ecuador expressly stated that it raised \u201c20 grounds for annulment.\u201d157 Accordingly, the Committee understands that Ecuador declined to pursue said specific ground and therefore the Committee does not address such ground in the present decision.\n\nApplication on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 195-201.\n\nTr. Day 1 January 12, 2021, 16:7.\n\n173.\n\nFor the purpose of clarity and consistency, the Committee has classified the specific grounds on matters related to (a) jurisdiction, (b) merits, (c) damages, and (d) counterclaim.\n\n174.\n\nFor the sake of efficiency, the Committee classifies Ecuador's claims on the Tribunal's findings that \u201cDecree 662 breached the Participation Contracts\u201d, and that \u201cDecree 662 and ensuing measures breached Article 4 of the Treaty\u201d under the same category.158\n\nSee Section IV.B.3.\n\n**A. G****rounds** **R****elated to the** **T****ribunal****'****s findings on jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that the Treaty extends jurisdiction to a** **company only indirectly controlled by French nationals**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n175.\n\nEcuador contends that, notwithstanding the text of Article 9(2) of the Treaty, the Tribunal asserted its jurisdiction on the basis of Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty. By so doing, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based.\n\n176.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador argues that the Tribunal founded its jurisdiction on an incorrect and incoherent interpretation of the Treaty's provisions. The Tribunal asserted its jurisdiction on the basis of Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty, despite Article 9(2) of the Treaty which requires that the shares of a company incorporated in the host State be held in majority by a national or a juridical person of the other Contracting Party. With this finding, the Tribunal failed to abide by its duty to read the Treaty as a whole and to ensure its effectiveness. Therefore, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.159\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 233-235.\n\n177.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador states that the Tribunal's reasoning is limited to ambiguous and unsupported assertions and provides no explanation as to why it discarded Ecuador's key argument, i.e., that Perenco's proposed interpretation of the Treaty results in a manifest inconsistency of the Treaty \u201cwhereby indirectly-controlled foreign companies benefit from rights under the Treaty pursuant to Article 1(3)(ii), but are unable to invoke the jurisdiction of the Centre to protect these rights pursuant to Article 9(2)\u201d.160\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 247.\n\n178.\n\nEcuador thereby requests the annulment of \u201cthe decision that the Treaty extends jurisdiction to a company only indirectly controlled by French nationals,\u201d \u201calong with the entirety of the Award itself, as the entirety of the Award is premised on the Tribunal's supposed jurisdiction over Perenco.\u201d161\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 250.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n179.\n\nPerenco contends that Ecuador's claim that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons in finding that the Treaty extends jurisdiction to companies indirectly controlled by French nationals has no merit. The Tribunal had the power to interpret the Treaty and it provided clear reasons explaining why the unqualified term \u201ccontrolled\u201d in Article 1(3) covered both direct and indirect control.162\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 102.\n\n180.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Perenco stresses that Ecuador's contention that the Tribunal found its jurisdiction on an \u201cincorrect and incoherent interpretation of the Treaty\u201d and therefore exceeded its powers, is flawed and concedes that the Tribunal applied, or endeavored to apply, the applicable body of law, i.e., the Treaty.163 Errors of law are not a manifest excess of powers, including when it comes to jurisdiction. The contrary would allow the Committee to consider the Tribunal's jurisdiction *de novo* and assume the role of an appellate body.164\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 103.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 104.\n\n181.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal's interpretation of the Treaty was tenable and was correct. The Tribunal founded its jurisdiction based on the ordinary meaning of the terms in Articles 3 and 1(3) of the Treaty and in light of the Treaty's object and purpose. It also considered the Treaty's *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* and the Parties' submissions.165 \u201cArticle 1(3)(ii) in conjunction with Article 9(2)\u201d does not change the analysis. As found by the Tribunal, Article 9(2) is \u201ca special rule that, consistent with Article 25(2)(b) *in fine* of the ICSID Convention, is intended to extend ICSID jurisdiction to instances where a national of the State party to the dispute would otherwise have no standing to bring a claim against its own State.\u201d166 Article 9(2) does not provide for the meaning of the general definitions in Article 1(3). Moreover, Ecuador does not demonstrate how any such excess of powers would be \u2018manifest'.167\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 107-109.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 110.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 111-113.\n\n182.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Perenco contends that the Tribunal provided reasons for rejecting Ecuador's objection that reading Article 1(3) to encompass indirect control results in a manifest inconsistency of the Treaty.168 Even under the *Kl\u00f6ckner I* standard, it is possible to \u201cdiscern how and why the Tribunal could reach its decision on this point,\u201d as it explained: (i) why the ordinary meaning of the unqualified word \u201ccontrolled\u201d encompasses indirect control, (ii) why Article 9(2) expands ICSID jurisdiction in the specific factual setting of a legal entity of the host State seeking to claim against its own State, and (iii) why it makes more sense to apply the general Article 1 definitions throughout the Treaty and the specific test of control under Article 9(2) in the specific situation envisaged therein.169\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 114.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 116.\n\n183.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers in finding that the Treaty extends jurisdiction to companies indirectly controlled by French nationals, nor failed to state its reasons for doing so.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Applicant claims that by deciding that the Treaty extends to a company only indirectly controlled by French nationals, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons for its decision.\n\n185.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador's argument is based on the premise that the Tribunal incorrectly applied the law, not that the Tribunal did not apply the proper law.170 As analyzed in Section III.B.2, the Committee considers that to determine whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers it must examine whether the Tribunal properly identified the applicable law and endeavored to apply such law.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 236-245.\n\n186.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that the Treaty is the applicable law to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. It is also undisputed that to decide on its jurisdiction, the Tribunal identified and applied the Treaty. Based on its interpretation of the Treaty, the Tribunal concluded that:171\n\nHaving regard to the fact that the text of the applicable provision of the Treaty refers simply to \u2018controlled', the Tribunal is persuaded by the fact that the formal transfer of the shares of the late Mr. Hubert Perrodo to his heirs was an administrative or ministerial act. It is true that it occurred after the consent to ICSID arbitration was given, but it is also true that it could have occurred at any time after the heirs became the owners of the estate under French law, and that occurred at the time of death, namely, 29 December 2006, over 10 months prior to the giving of consent.\n\nMoreover, the evidence of French control is so substantial, so compelling and un-contradicted that it is the Tribunal's view that in the circumstances of this case, it is most consonant with the approach taken by international law to give weight to the fact of Bahamian law's recognition that the heirs owned the shares as a matter of French law and as a result they had beneficial ownership of the shares as a matter of Bahamian law prior to their formal re-registration in the names.172\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 69-73 (AAE-033); Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 509-530 (AAE-163).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 528-529 (AAE-163).\n\n187.\n\nIt is not on the Committee to examine whether the Tribunal's interpretation of the Treaty was correct or incorrect. That assessment would be equivalent to an appeal and to a *de novo* review of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, which is beyond the Committee's powers under the ICSID Convention. Thus, the Committee finds no ground to conclude that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n188.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador argues that the Tribunal provided no explanation on why it discarded its key argument on the matter, namely that Article 9(2) of the Treaty expressly excludes from ICSID jurisdiction entities that are incorporated under the laws of the Contracting Party and that are not directly owned in majority by national or legal entities of the other Contracting Party. For Ecuador, when reading Article 1(3) in conjunction with Article 9(2), the \u201conly plausible interpretation is that Article 1(3) requires direct ownership, as opposed to indirect interest in the company.\u201d173 Ecuador further claims that the Tribunal failed to engage with Ecuador's proposition that Perenco's reading of the Treaty results in a manifest internal inconsistency of the Treaty \u201cwhereby indirectly-controlled foreign companies benefit from rights under the Treaty pursuant to Article 1(3)(ii), but are unable to invoke the jurisdiction of the Centre to protect these rights pursuant to Article 9(2).\u201d174\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 239-240.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 247.\n\n189.\n\nThe Committee is not persuaded by Ecuador's position and finds that the Tribunal expressly addressed Ecuador's alleged \u201ckey argument\u201d and explained the reasons for rejecting it.\n\n190.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal upheld Claimant's characterization of Article 9(2) by concluding that it is \u201cas special rule that, consistent with Article 25(2)(b) *in fine* of the ICSID Convention, is intended to extend ICSID jurisdiction to instances where a national of the State party to the dispute would otherwise have no standing to bring a claim against its own State.\u201d175 The Tribunal then rejected Ecuador's interpretation of the Treaty by concluding that:\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the Respondents that the Article 9, second paragraph, test of control must be read back into and dictate the meaning of the general definitions of Article 1. While the Respondents disavowed any intent to extrapolate the rules applicable to Article 25(2)(b) *in fine* to the more general definitions contained in Article 1, in the Tribunal's view, this is what the objection does. It seems more plausible to apply the Article 1 definitions throughout the Treaty and, when it comes to Article 9 and the special situation envisaged there, to apply that article's specific test of control to a juridical person that is a national of the host State that seeks to claim against its own State. The Tribunal sees no absurdity in this interpretation, nor does it see, to use the Respondents' words, an \u201cinternal inconsistency\u201d in the Treaty resulting from such an interpretation.\n\nGiven Article 9's purpose, it is reasonable for the Contracting Parties to require that foreign control be established in a particular way, in this case choosing to do so by requiring that a majority of the shares of the local company belong to nationals or a juridical person of a Contracting Party other than the respondent party. But it does not follow inexorably that the requirements of Article 9 must dictate the interpretation of Article 1. Accordingly, the first limb of the Respondents' objection is dismissed.\u201d176\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 71 (AAE-033).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 72-73 (AAE-033).\n\n191.\n\nThe Committee observes that the Tribunal clearly explained the reasons for its decision to interpret the Treaty in the sense proposed by the Claimant and to reject Ecuador's interpretation of the Treaty. The fact that the Applicant disagrees with the Tribunal's reasoning or considers that more reasons should have been given is not a ground to annul the Award under Article 52(1)(e) (See Section III.D.2).\n\n192.\n\nConsequently, the Committee finds that the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers nor failed to state reasons for its decision that the Treaty extends jurisdiction to a company only indirectly controlled by French nationals.\n\n**(2) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that Perenco was controlled by French nationals**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n193.\n\nEcuador contends that the Tribunal seriously departed from fundamental rule of procedure\u2013 its right to equal treatment\u2013by providing Perenco with a further opportunity to attempt to establish that the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione personae*.177\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 254, 258-259\n\n194.\n\nEcuador argues that by the end of the jurisdictional phase, Perenco had not been able to establish that it was an investor under the Treaty.178 However, instead of denying jurisdiction, the Tribunal provided Perenco with a further opportunity to attempt to establish that the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione personae* even though Perenco had had more than three years to do so.179 What is more, the Tribunal advised Perenco of the issues it needed to prove and the evidence it needed to adduce in order for the Tribunal to find jurisdiction.180 It was only on the basis of the evidence subsequently adduced by Perenco \u201cthat the Tribunal was able to find in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that the evidence of French control was so \u2018substantial, so compelling and un-contradicted' that is compelled the dismissal of Ecuador's objection to jurisdiction *ratione personae*.\u201d181\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 251.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 252.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 253.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 254.\n\n195.\n\nEcuador does not contest that it was given the opportunity to discuss the new arguments and evidence adduced by Perenco. Instead, it submits that it was manifestly unfair to grant Perenco an additional opportunity to correct its case\u2013a treatment that was not accorded to Ecuador.182\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 258.\n\n196.\n\nAccordingly, Ecuador requests the annulment of \u201cthe decision that Perenco was controlled by French nationals [\u2026], along with the entirety of the Award itself, as the entirety of the Award is premised on the Tribunal's supposed jurisdiction over Perenco.\u201d183\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 260.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n197.\n\nPerenco objects Ecuador's claim that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by providing \u201cPerenco with a further opportunity to establish that the Tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione personae* during the merits phase.\u201d184 As Ecuador acknowledges, it had \u201cthe opportunity to discuss the new arguments and evidence adduced by Perenco.\u201d185\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 118.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 118.\n\n198.\n\nIt was within the Tribunal's powers to call on both Parties to produce additional evidence and Ecuador admits that it had the opportunity to be heard about that evidence. There are no rules of procedure in ICSID preventing the Tribunal from ordering Perenco to produce further evidence of French control and joining jurisdictional issues to the merit. Conversely, Articles 42(2) and 43 of the ICSID Convention, and Arbitration Rule 19 confer broad powers to the Tribunal to, at any stage of the proceedings, consider jurisdictional issues or call upon the parties to produce documents or other evidence.186\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 119.\n\n199.\n\nPerenco counters Ecuador's proposition that the Tribunal's conduct was \u201cunfair\u201d. Perenco provided additional evidence of French control four months prior to Ecuador's Counter- Memorial, so as to allow Ecuador sufficient time to address such evidence in its pleading. Ecuador addressed that additional evidence in its Counter-Memorial on Liability, in its Rejoinder on Liability, through two expert reports on Bahamian law, and through cross-examination of Perenco's witnesses and experts at the hearing. In its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal carefully considered and rejected Ecuador's arguments and evidence.187 Likewise, in the Decision on Reconsideration, the Tribunal rejected Ecuador's complaints by noting, among other, that both Parties were given the opportunity over two rounds of written pleadings to adduce further factual and expert evidence and to make submissions.188\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 119, 124.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 125.\n\n200.\n\nEcuador conveniently omits that the Tribunal also deferred certain issues and called for more evidence with respect to Ecuador's own counterclaim. If requesting additional information is an annullable error, then the counterclaim phase should never have taken place and the record should rest on the Tribunal's finding that Ecuador's counterclaims failed.189\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 126.\n\n201.\n\nFinally, even if the Committee were to find an annullable error, the Committee cannot annul the entirety of the Award. The Award is not just premised on the Tribunal's Treaty jurisdiction over Perenco. It is also premised on the Tribunal's jurisdiction pursuant to the participation contracts for Blocks 7 and 21 (the \u201c**Participation Contracts**\u201d).190\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 127.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nEcuador contends that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by according unequal treatment to the Parties by requesting Perenco to present evidence to demonstrate \u201c(i) that the shares of what is now called Perenco International Limited in fact form part of the estate under French law and are being or will be distributed to the heirs of Mr. Perrodo in accordance with that law; and (ii) the means and instrument(s) through which the heirs have exercised control over the Claimant.\u201d191 According to the Applicant, it was manifestly unfair that, after a full jurisdictional phase, the Tribunal allowed Perenco to correct its jurisdictional case, by indicating specifically the points that needed to be evidenced further.192 What is more, the Tribunal did not accord the same opportunity to Ecuador.193\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 106 (AAE-033).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 255.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 256.\n\n203.\n\nIn relation to the treatment accorded to the Parties, the Committee will analyze: (i) the Tribunal's powers under the ICSID Convention to request evidence from the Parties' *sua sponte* and the Tribunal's opportunity to do so; (ii) whether the Tribunal accorded Ecuador an opportunity to comment on the evidence presented by the Claimant in relation to the indirect control of Mr. Perrodo's heirs over Perenco; and (iii) whether the Tribunal unfairly gave Perenco an opportunity that it did not afford Ecuador in similar circumstances.\n\n204.\n\nAs to the first issue, the Committee remarks that under Rule 34(2) of the Arbitration Rules, \u201c[t]he Tribunal may, if it deems it necessary at any stage of the proceeding: (a) call upon the parties to produce documents, witnesses and experts [\u2026].\u201d This rule clearly states that the Tribunal is empowered to request evidence from the Parties *sua sponte* and that it can do so \u201cat any stage of the proceeding\u201d, as long as it deems it necessary.\n\n205.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal expressly stated that:\n\nIt has not yet arrived at a conclusion on whether the deletion of the words \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d could have the effect ascribed to it by the Respondents or whether it is necessary to consult supplementary materials in order to determine the meaning of Article 1(3)(ii). It has decided that it requires further evidence and submissions before it determines the Claimant's standing to invoke the Treaty.194\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 86 (AAE-033).\n\n206.\n\nFollowing that statement, the Tribunal invited both Parties to produce evidence on the Treaty's negotiating history in France's possession. Likewise, the Tribunal requested the Claimant to produce certain evidence on the alleged indirect control of Mr. Perrodo's heirs over the Claimant.195\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 94, 105-106 (AAE-033).\n\n207.\n\nThe Committee considers that although the jurisdictional phase had already concluded, nothing precluded the Tribunal from leaving certain jurisdictional matters to a subsequent phase in the proceeding and from requesting evidence to the Parties at that point of the proceeding. That is all the more since the Tribunal had explicitly decided to join certain jurisdictional issues to the merits.196 In this perspective, Rule 34(2) expressly provides that a Tribunal may request evidence to the Parties \u201cat any stage of the proceeding.\u201d The Committee is of the view that the Tribunal has wide discretion to request to the Parties the evidence that it considers necessary, and therefore, depending on the circumstances of each case, it may request evidence to one party or both Parties. As explained by the Tribunal in its Decision on Reconsideration:\n\nIt is not unusual for tribunals to defer consideration of jurisdictional objections pending a further development of the evidentiary record and tribunals commonly join jurisdictional issues to the merits, as indeed the Tribunal did in the instant case. Thus, the Decision on Jurisdiction did not signal the end of the jurisdictional phase. Having reflected on the parties' submissions and the evidence, the Tribunal decided it was appropriate to provide both parties with a further opportunity to address certain issues in respect of which the Tribunal was not yet prepared to rule.197\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 86 (AAE-033).\n\nDecision on Reconsideration, \u00b6 91 (AAE-139).\n\n208.\n\nAs to the second issue, the Committee observes that Ecuador had ample opportunity to rebut the evidence and arguments submitted by the Claimant following the Tribunal's request. In fact, Ecuador acknowledges \u201cthat it was given the opportunity to discuss the new arguments and evidence adduced by Perenco in support of its jurisdictional case.\u201d198 As noted by the Tribunal in its Decision on Reconsideration:\n\nBoth parties were [\u2026] given the opportunity over two rounds of written pleadings to adduce further factual and expert evidence and to make submissions. With respect to questions of Bahamian law, both sides adduced expert evidence on questions such as the status of shares owned by an individual who died intestate and the steps required under Bahamian law to effect the transfer of title to the shares. Both parties also addressed the Treaty's negotiating history, with Ecuador urging the Tribunal to pay particularly close attention to the evolution of the relevant provisions (as recorded in paragraphs 492 to 499 of the Decision), while Perenco's main argument was that the plain meaning of the text prevailed, and further that the negotiating history was too fragmentary and incomplete to be reliable.199\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 258.\n\nDecision on Reconsideration, \u00b6 92 (AAE-139).\n\n209.\n\nThirdly, Ecuador's case is mainly based on the allegation that the Tribunal did not accord the same opportunity to Ecuador. The Committee observes that the Applicant's allegation is made in the abstract; namely, that the Tribunal did not accord to Ecuador the opportunity to present its case with evidence specifically requested by the Tribunal, as it did with Perenco. Equal opportunity is not \u201csame number of opportunities.\u201d In any event, for the sake of discussion, the opportunity that the Tribunal granted to the Claimant as regards Perenco's French control is similar to the opportunity granted to Ecuador as regards the environmental counterclaim, as explained below.\n\n210.\n\nAkin to the Decision on Jurisdiction, in the Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, the Tribunal concluded that it was not yet prepared to rule given the significant gaps between the Parties' experts and therefore informed the Parties of its intention \u201cto appoint its own independent environmental expert.\u201d200 The Tribunal explained that: although it had \u201carrived at the point where it narrowed the counterclaim on the principal issues of law and fact,\u201d \u201cwith regard to many of the IEMS/GSI differences, the Tribunal does not feel able to prefer one above the other.\u201d201 \u201cAccordingly, the Tribunal has concluded that it must require an additional phase of fact-finding in order to arrive at a proper and just conclusion. It is not content to issue a final determination on the extent of Perenco's liability on the basis of the current expert reports.\u201d202\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 587 (AAE-106).\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 581(AAE-106).\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 586 (AAE-106).\n\n211.\n\nThe Committee remarks that the Tribunal decided to take this choice after acknowledging that:\n\nThe Tribunal well understands that the onus of proof is on a party who makes an allegation and it could be said that because of the doubt in which the Tribunal finds itself Ecuador could be said to have failed in tipping the burden in its favour. However, as the Tribunal is satisfied that there has been some damage for which it seems likely that Perenco is liable, the Tribunal is not disposed to dismiss the counterclaim *in limine.*203\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 585 (AAE-106).\n\n212.\n\nBased on the foregoing reasons, the Committee concludes that there are no reasons to believe that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**(3) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that it had jurisdiction over Perenco's claims that** ***caducidad*** **breached the Block 21 Participation Contract**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n213.\n\nEcuador contends that the Tribunal's decision to assert its jurisdiction over Perenco's claim that Ecuador breached the Block 21 Participation Contract when it declared *caducidad* is a manifest excess of powers, a failure to state reasons, and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n214.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador argues that the dispute regarding the *caducidad* declaration was a legal one and therefore fell outside the scope of the arbitration agreement contained in Annex XVI of the Block 21 Participation Contract, which was limited to the resolution of technical and/or economic disputes.204 The Tribunal not only found that it was sufficient for there to be \u201ceconomic consequences,\u201d but also omitted to apply the requirement set out in the arbitration agreement that the dispute must be one \u201carising out of the application of the Participation Contract.\u201d Thus, it is clear that the Tribunal failed to apply the arbitration agreement between the Parties and therefore, in asserting its jurisdiction, the Tribunal acted in a manifest excess of powers.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 261.\n\n215.\n\nAs to the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Ecuador states that the Tribunal denied its right to be heard, considering that the Tribunal upheld jurisdiction over Perenco's contractual *caducidad* claim on the basis of the \u201ceconomic consequences\u201d test, not previously advanced or discussed by either of the Parties.205\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 280-282.\n\n216.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador claims that, with its holding in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal contradicted previous findings in its Decision on Jurisdiction. First, the Tribunal contradicted its holding that it did not have jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over Perenco's allegation that Ecuador violated the Ecuadorian Constitution\u2014and thereby its obligations under the Participation Contracts\u2014by the enactment of Law 42 because such allegation concerned \u201cessentially legal matters.\u201d206 Second, it contradicted its previous finding that the arbitration agreement is conditional on two requirements: (i) the dispute being of a technical or economic nature, and (ii) the dispute arising out of the application of the Block 21 Participation Contract. Ecuador claims that the contradiction is such that the Tribunal's reasons cancel each other out, amounting to a failure to state reasons.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 274-279.\n\n217.\n\nFor the above reasons, Ecuador requests the annulment of the decision to assert jurisdiction over Perenco's claim that Ecuador breached the Block 21 Participation Contract when it declared *caducidad*. \u201cAccordingly, the Tribunal's ensuing decisions to (i) uphold the claim of breach of the Block 21 Contract as a result of the declaration of *caducidad*, and (ii) order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco, insofar as it includes Perenco's contract claims under the Block 21 Participation Contract, should also be annulled.\u201d207\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 283.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n218.\n\nPerenco counters Ecuador's claim that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons, and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure \u201cby finding that Ecuador's declaration of *caducidad* fell within the scope of the arbitration agreement in the Block 21 Participation Contract.\u201d208 Perenco submits the following argumentation:\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 129.\n\n219.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, although Ecuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by committing \u201cgross errors of law\u201d in finding that *caducidad* fell within the Contract's arbitration agreement, errors of law\u2014even if labelled as \u201cgross\u201d\u2014 are not annullable under the ICSID Convention. Ecuador neither argues that the Tribunal incorrectly identified the applicable law, i.e., Clause 20.2 and Annex XVI of the Block 21 Participation Contracts and Ecuadorian law, nor that the Tribunal failed to endeavor to apply that law.209\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 132-133.\n\n220.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal's findings were not erroneous, they were based on the language of the Participation Contract as interpreted under Ecuadorian law. The Tribunal explained that Clause 20.2 of Block 21 Participation Contract expressly provided that *caducidad* disputes fell within the scope of its arbitration provisions. The Tribunal also explained that pursuant to Annex XVI, \u201ccontractual claims advanced by Perenco that concerned a \u2018technical' or \u2018economic' dispute relating to the Block 21 Participation Contract fell within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\u201d210 Having considered these provisions and the Parties' submissions, the Tribunal determined that the Parties' dispute, including the declaration of *caducidad*, fell within the scope of the Block 21 Participation Contract's arbitration agreement because it was an \u201ceconomic\u201d dispute within the meaning of Annex XVI. In paragraphs 138, 140, 141, 142, 146, 235, 306, 315 and 316 of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal set out in detail the reasons why it found that the dispute was \u201ceconomic.\u201d211\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 133-134.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 135.\n\n221.\n\nAs to the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Ecuador's complaint that the Tribunal violated its right to be heard by determining that *caducidad* had \u201ceconomic consequences\u201d is nonsensical. Ecuador had the opportunity to be heard and exercised it, but the Tribunal appropriately rejected its arguments as meritless. Ecuador seems to be objecting that neither party used the precise words \u201ceconomic consequences\u201d in its submissions. Yet, both parties made extensive submissions on the impact of *caducidad* and the economic consequences of the participation formula, on the economic equilibrium of the contracts, and on the economic effects of Ecuador's actions on Perenco's overall share. Also, a tribunal is not \u201cprecluded from adopting legal reasoning that was not put forward by one of the parties without first seeking the parties' opinion.\u201d212 In any event, even if the Committee were to upheld Ecuador's argument, there would be no demonstrable difference in the outcome of the case given that the Tribunal found that *caducidad* breached both the Block 21 Contract and the Treaty.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 146.\n\n222.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador is wrong that the Tribunal \u201ccontradicted its previous holding in its Decision on Jurisdiction\u201d and thereby failed to state reasons for why it had jurisdiction over *caducidad*. Perenco contends that the Tribunal did state reasons for its decision and there was no contradiction on its reasoning, much less contradictions genuinely amounting to a complete failure of reasoning.213\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 139-141.\n\n223.\n\nEcuador's first alleged contradiction\u2014that the Tribunal acknowledged that \u201cessentially legal matters\u201d were excluded from the scope of the arbitration agreement but then failed to exclude *caducidad*\u2014ignores the Tribunal's finding that *caducidad* was both legal and economic in nature.214\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 141.\n\n224.\n\nEcuador's second alleged contradiction\u2014that the Tribunal disregarded the requirement that the dispute arise out of the application of the Block 21 Participation Contract\u2014ignores that the Tribunal interpreted Clause 20.2 of the Contract in conjunction with Annex XVI. On the one hand, Annex XVI provides that \u201ctechnical and/or economic disputes arising out of the application of the Participation Contract\u201d shall be resolved through ICSID arbitration. On the other hand, Clause 20.2 contains a special rule which \u201ccontemplates that a dispute regarding a declaration of caducity which is related to technical or economic aspects may be submitted to arbitration.\u201d In the light of these provisions, the Tribunal explained that \u201cAnnex XVI does not single out caducity, placing upon the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal the sole limitation that the claim should concern a \u2018technical' or \u2018economic' dispute.\u201d215 Therefore, there are no contradictions in the Tribunal's reasoning.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 144.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nEcuador contends that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons, manifestly exceeded its powers, and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure when it declared having jurisdiction over Perenco's claim that Ecuador breached the Block 21 Participation Contract by declaring *caducidad*.\n\n226.\n\nAs regards the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador claims that in deciding that \u201cthe declaration of *caducidad* has economic consequences and therefore falls within its subject-matter jurisdiction,\u201d216 the Tribunal failed to apply the arbitration agreement. Yet, the Committee is not convinced by Ecuador's position.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 316 (AAE-163).\n\n227.\n\nIn the first place, the Committee notes that when deciding whether it had jurisdiction over Perenco's contractual claim that Ecuador breached the Block 21 Participation Contract by declaring *caducidad*, the Tribunal identified the proper law applicable to its jurisdiction, that is Clause 20.2 and Annex XVI of Block 21 Participation Contract.\n\n228.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal explained that \u201c[w]hen the Block 21 Participation Contract was executed in 1995, Ecuador was not a Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention. This explains the language used in Clause 20.2.12 providing for the arbitration to be governed by different rules depending on whether Ecuador was or was not a Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention at the moment of the institution of the arbitral proceedings.\u201d217\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 127 (AAE-033).\n\n229.\n\nAnnex XVI provides in its relevant parts that:\n\nOnce the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes Relating to Investments, ICSID, has been approved by the National Congress of the Republic of Ecuador, and, therefore, is fully in force, the Parties agree that any technical and/or economic dispute arising out of the application of the Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 \u2026, which is the object of the present Contract, shall be resolved according to the provisions of the aforementioned Convention, leaving, accordingly, without effect the arbitration procedure in clause twenty of the Contract.\n\nFor the application of the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes Relating to Investments, ICSID, the following procedural rules shall also apply:\n\n1. The Parties agree to submit to the INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES any technical and/or economic dispute relating to this Participation Contract\u2026through the [system] of arbitration, which for all effects is hereafter referred to as \u201cTHE CENTRE.\u201d\n\n2. The Parties acknowledge that the object of the Participation Contract implies the making of investments, so that the ICSID Arbitration procedure is applicable to the Contract.\n\n3. The Parties acknowledge that the Contractor's right to submit any technical and/or economic dispute to the CENTRE shall not affect the Contractor's ability to receive total or partial compensation from any third party in relation to any damage or loss of the object in dispute.\n\n230.\n\nConsidering that Ecuador was already a Contracting Party to the ICSID Convention when the Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration on April 30, 2008, the Tribunal concluded that the Underlying Arbitration is precisely the scenario in which the aforementioned contractual provision is applicable,218 and \u201chas to be looked at when determining the Tribunal's competence over contractual claims.\u201d219\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 128 (AAE-033).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 130 (AAE-033).\n\n231.\n\nThe Tribunal then interpreted Annex XVI as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that this interpretation based on the opposition of \u2018legal' versus \u2018technical and/or economic' cannot be accepted as it would result in depriving Annex XVI of its applicability in general. The ICSID Convention requires the dispute to be a legal one. [\u2026]\n\nThe Parties to the Block 21 Participation Contract agreed, in its Annex XVI, \u2018to submit to the INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES any technical and/or economic dispute relating to this Participation Contract.' It is thus the task of the Tribunal to ascertain whether the contractual claims advanced by Perenco in this arbitration concern a \u2018technical' or \u2018economic' dispute relating to the Block 21 Participation Contract. The language \u2018and/or' suggests that the dispute does not need to be of a cumulative nature, i.e., \u2018technical and economic'.220\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 134-135 (AAE-033).\n\n232.\n\nIn turn, in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal concluded that:\n\n[\u2026] Clause 20.2 of the Block 21 Contract contemplates that a dispute regarding a declaration of caducity which is related to technical or economic aspects may be submitted to arbitration. Annex XVI does not single out caducity, placing upon the subject-matter jurisdicton [sic.] of the Tribunal the sole limitation that the claim should concern a \u2018technical' or \u2018economic' dispute.\n\nHaving regard to the Tribunal's findings in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers that the declaration of *caducidad* has economic consequences and therefore falls within its subject-matter jurisdiction. The Tribunal accordingly finds that it has jurisdiction to entertain Perenco's claim that Ecuador breached the Block 21 Contract when it declared *caducidad*.221\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 315-316 (AAE-163).\n\n233.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's decision, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal allegedly failed to apply the proper law for two main reasons. First, because under the arbitration agreement, jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is conditioned upon a dispute being of a \u201ctechnical\u201d or \u201ceconomic\u201d nature and, therefore, it is insufficient for a dispute to have mere \u201ceconomic consequences\u201d to be covered by the arbitration agreement. And second, because the Tribunal omitted to apply the requirement that the dispute must be one \u201carising out of the application of the Participation Contracts,\u201d given that the *caducidad* declaration does not arise out of the application of the Block 21 Participation Contract.222\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 268.\n\n234.\n\nThe Committee observes that although Ecuador argues that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law, the Applicant's contention is in fact an allegation of misapplication of the proper law, not a claim of non-application of the proper law.\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal identified the applicable law\u2014Clause 20.2 and Annex XVI of the Block 21 Participation Contracts\u2014to define its jurisdiction and endeavored to apply such law. The Committee may or may not agree with the Tribunal's interpretation that \u201ctechnical\u201d or \u201ceconomic\u201d nature is equivalent to \u201ceconomic consequences\u201d; however, it is beyond its competence to adjudge the Tribunal's interpretation of the arbitration agreement. By so doing, the Committee would be acting as a court of appeals. Therefore, the Committee finds no grounds to conclude that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n236.\n\nAs regards the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Ecuador contends that by *sua* s*ponte* espousing and applying the \u201ceconomic consequences\u201d test, the Tribunal denied Ecuador the right to address and reject such test. To resolve Ecuador's contention, the Committee will examine whether the Tribunal's finding on the \u201ceconomic consequences\u201d fits the legal framework discussed by the Parties, so as to determine whether the Tribunal had to give an opportunity to the Parties to comment on such conclusion or not (see Section III.C.2).\n\n237.\n\nThe Committee observes that although the Parties did not incorporate in their submissions the specific words \u201ceconomic consequences,\u201d the Parties disputed at length the scope of the terms \u201ctechnical and/or economic\u201d dispute. This is clearly noted in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n238.\n\nOn the one hand, Ecuador claimed, *inter alia*, that:\n\nUnder Clause 20.2 of the Contract, entitled \u2018technical and/or economic arbitration,' only \u2018technical matters involving economic aspects,' or \u2018economic matters involving technical aspects' arising out of the Block 21 Participation Contract may be submitted to ICSID arbitration. Annex XVI, which also addresses arbitration of any \u2018technical and/or economic disputes,' must be interpreted in light of Clause 20.2.223\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 110 (AAE-033).\n\n239.\n\nOn the other hand, Perenco contended, *inter alia*, that:\n\nAnnex XVI of the Block 21 Contract permits arbitration of \u2018any [\u2026] economic dispute related to' that Contract. [\u2026] The language of Annex XVI, which covers \u2018any' dispute, that is either technical \u2018and/or' economic, is expansive.224 [\u2026]\n\nEcuador is wrong to rely on the narrow language of Clause 20.2 for its assertion that only \u2018technical matters involving economic aspects and vice versa' can be arbitrated under the Contract, because this language is not included in Annex XVI. First, Annex XVI expressly displaced Clause 20.2, by providing after ratification of Convention, technical and/or economic disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, \u2018thus leaving without effect the arbitration procedure set out in clause twenty of the Contract.' [\u2026] Second, the Parties intended that Annex XVI would replace the prior dispute resolution clause in its entirety. [\u2026] Third, Ecuador is wrong to assert that Clause 20.2 and Annex XVI are to be read together, such that \u2018technical matters involving economic aspects and vice versa' language of Clause 20.2 defines the \u2018technical and/or economic' language of Annex XVI. According to Perenco, \u2018Clause 20.2 was self-evidently meant to apply before congressional approval of the ICSID Convention, while Annex XVI was meant to apply after congressional approval of the ICSID Convention.'225\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 117 (AAE-033).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 118-120 (AAE-033).\n\n240.\n\nFurthermore, it is undisputed that both Parties presented submissions \u201con the impact of *caducidad* and the economic consequences of the participation formula, on the economic equilibrium of the contracts, and on the economic effects of Ecuador's actions on Perenco's overall share.\u201d226\n\nCounter Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 146.\n\n241.\n\nThus, the Committee finds that the Tribunal's conclusion fits within the legal framework discussed by the Parties regarding the interpretation on the scope and contours of Annex XVI. The fact that the Tribunal did not adopt the exact same position or terminology advanced by the Parties does not mean that the Tribunal created a new and unexpected legal framework that ought to be commented by the Parties. Consequently, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not seriously depart from Ecuador's right to be heard.\n\n242.\n\nAs regards the failure to state reasons, Ecuador claims that by contradicting its previous findings, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its finding that it had jurisdiction over Perenco's contractual claim regarding Ecuador's breach of Block 21 Participation Contract by the *caducidad* declaration.\n\n243.\n\nAs regards the first alleged contradiction, Ecuador claims that in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that \u201cessentially legal matters\u201d were excluded from the scope of the arbitration agreement; however, in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal failed to exclude *caducidad*. Nonetheless, the Committee finds no contradiction in the Tribunal's Decisions, much less a contradiction tantamount to a failure to state reasons that gives rise to annulment as explained in Section III.D.2.\n\n244.\n\nThe Committee observes that even though the Tribunal indeed reasoned that \u201cessentially legal matters\u201d were excluded from the scope of the arbitration agreement, neither in its Decision on Jurisdiction nor in any other decision, the Tribunal concluded that *caducidad* was \u201cessentially a legal matter\u201d so as to clearly contradict its subsequent decision not to exclude the *caducidad* declaration from the scope of the arbitration agreement. To the contrary, as explained above, the Tribunal found that the dispute related to the *caducidad* declaration was both legal and economic.\n\n245.\n\nAs regards the second alleged contradiction, Ecuador submits that in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that the arbitration agreement was conditional on \u201c(i) being of a technical or economic nature, and (ii) arising out of the application of the Block 21 Participation Contract.\u201d227 Yet, in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal concluded that the sole condition for its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* was that a claim concerns a \u201ctechnical\u201d or \u201ceconomic\u201d dispute. For Ecuador, these contradictory reasons amount to failure to state reasons.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 276-278.\n\n246.\n\nThe Committee is not persuaded by Ecuador's argument. In its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal explained that Clause 20.2 of Block 21 Participation Contract expressly \u201cstates that if a caducity proceeding has been initiated, and the cause is related to technical or economic aspects, and the parties \u2018have differing views', either party may submit the matter to arbitration.\u201d228 Annex XVI provides that \u201ctechnical and/or economic disputes arising out of the application of the Participation Contract\u201d shall be resolved according to the provisions of the ICSID Convention.229 Following this conclusion, the Tribunal then recalled that \u201c[in its Decision on Jurisdiction] the Tribunal found that Annex XVI had to be considered when determining the scope of its *ratione materiae* competence over contractual claims.\u201d230 The Tribunal then emphasized that Annex XVI did not single out *caducidad* from the scope of the arbitration agreement\u2014contrary to Clause 21.3 of the Block 7 Participation Contract231\u2014, \u201cplacing upon the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal the sole limitation that the claim should concern a \u2018technical' or \u2018economic' dispute.\u201d232\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 314 (AAE-163).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 314 (AAE-163).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 315 (AAE-163).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 312 (AAE-163).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 315 (AAE-163).\n\n247.\n\nThe Committee stresses that the Tribunal's decision must be read as whole and in context. Read in isolation, the last sentence in paragraph 315 might indicate that the Tribunal disregarded the requirement that the dispute be one \u201carising out of the application of the Participation Contract.\u201d Yet, it is enough to read the previous paragraph (para. 314), quoting Annex XVI, to understand that the Tribunal acknowledges that the dispute must be technical and/or economical, and be one arising out of the application of the Participation Contract. Furthermore, the Tribunal did not expressly reject the latter criterion so as to conclude that there is a clear contradiction between the Tribunal's decisions.\n\n248.\n\nTherefore, the Committee finds no contradictions in the Tribunal's reasoning and therefore it finds no ground to conclude that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its finding on jurisdiction.\n\n**B. G****rounds on the** **T****ribunal****'****s findings on the merits**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that Ecuador's non-compliance with the Provisional Measures amounted to a breach of contract**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n249.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal failed to state reasons when, in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, it concluded that Ecuador had breached the Participation Contracts by not complying with the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures.\n\n250.\n\nPursuant to Clause 22.2.2 of the Participation Contracts, the Parties \u201cagreed that they would comply not only with a final award (i.e., in Spanish, the \u2018*laudo*' issued by a tribunal), but in addition, they would observe and comply with the decisions (i.e., in Spanish, the \u2018*decisiones*') of the tribunal.\u201d233 Yet, nowhere in its reasoning, did the Tribunal address Ecuador's key argument: that the Tribunal's recommendation in the Decision on Provisional Measures did not amount to \u201cdecisions\u201d for the purposes of Clause 22.2 of the Participation Contracts. Furthermore, the Tribunal's decision contradicts its previous Decision on Provisional Measures, in which it expressly stated that the provisional measures were \u201crecommendations.\u201d234\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 285.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 295.\n\n251.\n\nBased on the above reasons, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Tribunal's decision to uphold Perenco's claim of breach of Contract in respect of Law 42 at 99%, and \u201cthe Tribunal's ensuing decision to order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco, insofar as it includes Perenco's breach of Contract claim.\u201d235\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 299.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n252.\n\nPerenco contends that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons when finding that Ecuador's violations of the Decision on Provisional Measures breached its obligation under the Participation Contracts to comply with the Tribunal's decisions.236\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 151.\n\n253.\n\nContrary to Ecuador's assertion that the Tribunal did not explain how its Decision on Provisional Measures amounted to a decision covered under Clause 22.2 of the Participation Contract, the Tribunal did provide reasons for finding that the Decision on Provisional Measures was a \u201cdecision.\u201d In fact, the Tribunal rejected Ecuador's argument that \u201cdecisions\u201d only included awards. In any event, Ecuador's complaint does not meet the high threshold to establish a failure to state reasons.237\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 151, 153-155.\n\n254.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal's finding that the non-compliance with the Provisional Measures breached the Participation Contracts directly contradicts its Decision on Provisional Measures in which it expressly stated that provisional measures were \u201crecommendations\u201d. Yet, the Tribunal made clear that the decisions of provisional measures under Article 47(1) of the ICSID Convention are binding. Therefore, there is no contradiction.238\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 156-159.\n\n255.\n\nFinally, Ecuador's request to annul the Tribunal's decision to uphold Perenco's claim of breach of Contract in respect of Law 42 at 99% is nonsensical. The Tribunal's finding that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts was not based on Ecuador's breach of the Provisional Measures, but on the Tribunal's finding \u201cthat Decree 662 sought to coerce Perenco to \u2018unilaterally conver[t] the Participation Contracts into *de facto* service contracts.'\u201d239\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 161.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its finding that Ecuador breached the Participation Contracts by not complying with the Decision on Provisional Measures. According to Ecuador, the Tribunal failed to address its key argument, namely that the Tribunal's recommendations in the Decision on Provisional Measures did not amount to decisions (\u201c*decisiones*\u201d) under Clause 22.2.2 of the Participation Contracts. The Applicant further claims that the Tribunal's finding in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that the recommendations made in the Decision on Provisional Measures were binding, contradicts the Decision on Provisional Measures itself.240\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 284-299; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 221-236.\n\n257.\n\nFor the reasons explained below, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did provide reasons for its decision that Ecuador's non-compliance with the Decision on Provisional Measures amounted to a breach of the Participation Contracts.\n\n258.\n\nBetween paragraphs 413 and 417 of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal addresses the question on whether Ecuador was contractually obliged to comply with the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures. The Tribunal begins its analysis by referring to Clause 22.2.2 of the Participation Contracts. Then, it refers to the Parties' positions on the matter, expressly mentioning Ecuador's \u201ckey argument\u201d, as follows:\n\nEcuador's position is that while the parties undertook in the Contracts to submit to ICSID arbitration specified disputes and to abide by the Tribunal's \u2018final award', they did not undertake to, and these obligations could not inferentially amount to, an undertaking to comply with a tribunal's recommendation of provisional measures. It submitted that clause 22.2.2 was generally worded and, according to principles of contract interpretation in Ecuadorian law, must be \u2018read in accordance with the other clauses of the Participation Contracts which specifically refer to these topics' and which in its view establish \u2018only that the Parties agree to abide by the final award rendered by an ICSID tribunal.' Where it was intended to give a tribunal the power to provide for binding and enforceable provisional measures, the Contracts did so expressly (as was done elsewhere in the Contracts with respect to the power of a domestic arbitral tribunal to order provisional measures).241\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 415 (AAE-163).\n\n259.\n\nAfter referring to the Parties' positions, the Tribunal concluded that:\n\n[A] plain reading of clauses 22.2.2 indicates that the contracting parties agreed that they would comply not only with a final award (i.e., in Spanish, the \u2018*laudo*' issued by a tribunal), but in addition, they would observe and comply with the decisions (i.e., in Spanish, the \u2018*decisiones*') of the tribunal. The latter term constitutes a more capacious category of tribunal decisions of which the final award forms a part. Thus, under the Participation Contracts, Ecuador was bound to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures and its failure to do so constituted a breach of contract.242\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 417 (AAE-163).\n\n260.\n\nThe Committee observes that the Tribunal not only interpreted Clause 22.2.2, but also explained that its interpretation was based on the fact that the word \u201cdecisions\u201d (*decisiones*) is a more \u201ccapacious\u201d category of tribunal decisions of which the final award (*laudo*) is part.\n\n261.\n\nThe Committee cannot conclude that the Tribunal did not analyze and decide Ecuador's \u201ckey argument\u201d solely because there is no wording in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability expressly rejecting Ecuador's position. It is clear in the aforementioned decision that the Tribunal did not uphold Ecuador's interpretation of the clause because it considered that the word \u201cdecisions\u201d was a general category of arbitral decisions that encompassed the final award and other decisions. Likewise, although the Tribunal does not expressly indicate that the Decision on Provisional Measures is also part of the more general category of \u201cdecisions\u201d, such conclusion follows from the Tribunal's finding that \u201cEcuador was bound to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures [\u2026].\u201d243\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 417 (AAE-163).\n\n262.\n\nThe Committee finds therefore that the Tribunal did answer the question on whether the Decision on Provisional Measures was a \u201cdecision of the competent [\u2026] arbitrators\u201d under Clause 22.2.2 of the Participation Contracts. Consequently, the Tribunal satisfied the requirement set out in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention that \u201c[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\u201d\n\n263.\n\nFurthermore, the Committee finds no contradiction between the Tribunal's Decision on Provisional Measures and the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability as regards the binding character of the \u201crecommendations\u201d made by the Tribunal as provisional measures.\n\n264.\n\nIn its Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal expressly manifested that \u201c[i]t is now generally accepted that provisional measures are tantamount to orders, and are binding on the party on which they are directed [\u2026].\u201d244 Thereafter, in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal concluded that Ecuador was bound to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures. Accordingly, there is no contradiction between these decisions given that in both the Tribunal considered that its \u201crecommendations\u201d under the Decision on Provisional Measures were binding. The Tribunal's conclusion should come as no surprise, as it is widely accepted among ICSID arbitral tribunals and *ad hoc* committees that recommendations under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention are binding to the Parties.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 74 (CAA-013).\n\n265.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee finds no ground to annul the Tribunal's decision that Ecuador breached the Participation Contracts by not complying with the Decision on Provisional Measures.\n\n**(2) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that Perenco was entitled to suspend** **operations under the** ***exceptio non adimpleti contractus*** **principle**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n266.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, manifestly exceeded its powers, and failed to state its reasons when it decided *sua sponte* on the interpretation of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* theory.\n\n267.\n\nThe Applicant refers to the Tribunal's decision that Ecuador's non-compliance with the Decision on Provisional Measures breached the Participation Contracts and that such non-compliance justified Perenco's invocation of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* defense to suspend its operations in the Blocks. The Tribunal concluded erroneously that the *exceptio* defense was valid because Article 1568 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code is worded in general terms so that it covers administrative contracts.245\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 301-302.\n\n268.\n\nEcuador contends that the Tribunal's decision to apply the *exceptio* rule must be annulled *in limine*, as it is based on the Tribunal's finding that Ecuador's non-compliance with the Provisional Measures amounted to a breach of the Participation Contracts. Yet, even if the Committee were to uphold such finding, the Tribunal in any event (i) committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; (ii) manifestly exceeded its powers; and (iii) failed to state the reasons for deciding *sua sponte* on the interpretation of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* theory.246\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 303-304.\n\n269.\n\nAs to the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal violated its right to be heard for two reasons: first, the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 1568 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code was not advanced by either of the Parties; and second, the Tribunal did not afford either Party the opportunity to comment upon its novel theory.247\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 305-308.\n\n270.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador states that the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 1568 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code amounts to at least two gross errors under Ecuadorian law. First, the Tribunal grossly erred when concluding that the provisions of the Ecuadorian Civil Code apply with equal force and in all circumstances to private and administrative law contracts. Second, the Tribunal grossly erred when applying the *exceptio* rule, as it failed to recognize that the Ecuadorian Constitution equates hydrocarbons production with a public service and subjects it to the constitutional principle of continuity, thereby prohibiting its interruption.248 When a tribunal's analysis is a gross misapplication or misinterpretation of the law amounting to effective disregard or non-application of the law, it must be deemed a failure to apply the law. In this sense, given that the Tribunal \u201cgrossly disregarded Ecuadorian constitutional principles and failed to apply Ecuadorian administrative law,\u201d it exceeded its powers.249\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 309-313.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 313.\n\n271.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, the Applicant alleges that the Tribunal's reasoning on its decision that Ecuadorian law permits the party not in breach to suspend performance of its contractual obligations is limited to a two-line sentence in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. Such reasoning simply declares that Ecuadorian law permits the said performance suspension without demonstrating where this permission can be found in the law or without any analysis of the theories advanced by the legal experts.250\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 316-317.\n\n272.\n\nAccordingly, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Tribunal's decision to uphold Perenco's claim of breach of contract in respect of Law 42 at 99%, insofar as such decision is in part based on the Tribunal's finding that the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* defense could be invoked in relation to the Participation Contracts. Likewise, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Tribunal's ensuing decision to order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco, to the extent that it includes Perenco's breach of contract claim.251\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 319.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n273.\n\nPerenco objects Ecuador's position that the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, manifestly exceeded its powers, and failed to state reasons in reaching the decision that the principle of *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* in Article 1568 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code entitled Perenco to suspend operations when Ecuador's violations of provisional measures made its operations commercially impossible.252\n\nCounter Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 162.\n\n274.\n\nAs to the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Perenco remarks that the Tribunal reached its decision based on the plain language of the applicable provisions of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, after the Parties and their experts addressed that language in their submissions, arguments, and even on cross-examination.253\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 162-166; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 104-109.\n\n275.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador is also wrong to contend that the Tribunal's reliance on the text of the applicable Ecuadorian Civil Code provision was a \u201cgross error under Ecuadorian law\u201d.254 The Tribunal acted within its powers as it endeavored to apply Ecuadorian law, in particular Article 1568 of the Civil Code. Accordingly, even if mistaken, the Tribunal's conclusion that \u201cArticle 1568 of the Civil Code is worded in general terms and does not support the position that it may only be invoked by the public contracting entity that is party to the contract\u201d cannot amount to a manifest error as Ecuador asserts.255\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 167.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 169.\n\n276.\n\nEcuador further complains that the Tribunal failed to recognize that the Ecuadorian Constitution equates hydrocarbons production with a public service and subjects it to the constitutional principle of continuity, thereby prohibiting its interruption. However, as the Tribunal explained in accordance with its mandate, Article 1568 of the Civil Code could apply to a private party to an administrative contract. Moreover, the Tribunal analyzed and accepted that \u201c\u2018Participation Contracts, are aimed at exploiting a natural resource and target the provision of financial income to the national treasury' and are thus unrelated to public services that are subject to the principle of continuity.\u201d256 Hence, the Tribunal's rejection of Ecuador's argument was correct, and even if it had been incorrect it could not have amounted to a manifest excess of power.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 171.\n\n277.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Perenco states that Ecuador's mischaracterization of the Tribunal's decisions or the alleged brevity of the Tribunal's reasoning cannot establish any failure to state reasons, much less a complete failure to do so. The standard for a failure to state reasons is not whether the reasons given are sufficient, but whether reasons exist at all. In any event, Ecuador is wrong that the Tribunal's analysis on Perenco's right to suspend its performance under the Participation Contracts is contained in just two sentences. Ecuador omits to mention that the Tribunal took careful account of the different theories the Parties and their respective legal experts provided, and then found Perenco's permission to suspend operations in the express language of Article 1568 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code.257 Furthermore, Ecuador failed to establish why the Tribunal's finding is essential to the outcome of the case, as it must in order to establish an annullable error.258\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 175.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 174.\n\n278.\n\nEcuador's arguments do not justify its requested relief that the Committee annul the Tribunal's decision finding that Law 42 at 99% breached the Participation Contracts and awarding US$448.8 million in damages to Perenco. Ecuador failed to explain how the Tribunal's finding regarding the permission to suspend operations affects that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts, and how the entirety of the Tribunal's quantum determination should be annulled.259\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 176.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, manifestly exceeded its powers, and failed to state the reasons when deciding that Perenco was entitled to suspend operations under the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* principle.\n\n280.\n\nAs regards the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal breached the Applicant's right to be heard by upholding a novel interpretation of Article 1568 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code that was not advanced by either Party, and by not affording the Parties the opportunity to comment upon its novel interpretation.\n\n281.\n\nEcuador's claim is based on the Tribunal's decision that:\n\n[T]he [*exceptio non adimpleti contractus*] defence may be invoked by a private party to an administrative contract. Article 1568 of the Civil Code is worded in general terms and does not support the position that it may only be invoked by the public contracting entity that is party to the contract.\n\n282.\n\nThe Committee observes that contrary to Ecuador's claim, the Parties had the opportunity to present their positions on whether the *exceptio* provided in Article 1568 applied to administrative contracts.\n\n283.\n\nFirst, in his Fourth Expert Report260 and at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability,261 Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose, Perenco's legal expert, explained that, in his view, the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* applied to public contracts in Ecuador. For instance, at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, following a question from Ecuador on whether the *exceptio* is to be applied to public contracts, Dr. Perez Loose answered that \u201cthe first source is the Civil Code, clearly. This is something that you can find in the Civil Code, and as you read it, the Civil Code provisions doesn't make any difference between private or administrative contracts. It just refers to contracts.\u201d262\n\nFourth Expert Report of Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose, August 5, 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 36-57 (CEA-077).\n\n*Perenco v. Republic of Ecuador*, Transcript, Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, Day 6, 1507:6-21 (CEA-091).\n\n*Perenco v. Republic of Ecuador*, Transcript, Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, Day 6, 1507:6-21 (CEA-091); Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 106.\n\n284.\n\nSecond, in its Reply to Ecuador's Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims, Perenco expressly referred to Dr. Per\u00e9z Loose conclusions by noting that Perenco's conduct was not illegal under Ecuadorian law. As explained by Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose, Perenco's suspension was legitimate under the principle of *exceptio non adimpleti contractus*, which applies to bilateral contracts such as the Participation Contracts under Ecuadorian law.263\n\nPerenco's Reply to Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims, \u00b6 421 (CEA-081).\n\n285.\n\nThird, in its Third Expert Report, Dr. Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, Ecuador's legal expert, addressed the question on whether the *exceptio* incorporated in Article 1568 of the Civil Code is applicable to administrative contracts:\n\nThe possibility of opposing the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* to administrative contracts is an issue that clearly reflects the difference between the general law of contracts as regulated by the Civil Code, and that which applies to contracts entered into by the State and its institutions.\n\nThe Civil Code adopts this *exceptio* in Article 1568, pursuant to which \u2018in bilateral contracts, none of the parties will be in default for non-performance, insofar as the other party does not perform his or her obligations, or agrees to perform them in due time and form.'\n\nThis rule, of mandatory application in the field of Private Law, loses its general character and is only applicable in extraordinary circumstances in the field of Administrative Law, where collective interests have priority. Again, this is not a specificity of Ecuadorian law, but rather, as in other matters of Administrative Law, is the application of the leading opinions of authors, legislation and case law.264\n\nThird Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, November 5, 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 80-82 (CEA-078).\n\n286.\n\nThereafter, Dr. Aguilar referred to French, Spanish and Argentinean doctrine on the application of the *exceptio* to public contracts.\n\n287.\n\nIt is worth noting that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal expressly referred to (i) Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose's Fourth Expert Report and to his intervention at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, and (ii) Dr. Aguilar's Third Expert Report before concluding that \u201cArticle 1568 of the Civil Code is worded in general terms and does not support the position that it may only be invoked by the public contracting entity that is party to the contract.\u201d265\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 431 (AAE-163).\n\n288.\n\nIn view of the documents, legal expert reports, pleadings and transcripts available on the record, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not exceed the legal framework argued during the Underlying Arbitration when interpreting that the *exceptio* provided in Article 1568 may be invoked by a private party to an administrative contract.\n\n289.\n\nLikewise, the Committee finds that each Party had ample opportunity to present its case and to rebut the other Party's position regarding the application of the *exceptio* rule to administrative contracts.\n\n290.\n\nConsequently, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not depart from Ecuador's right to be heard when concluding that the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* rule provided in Article 1568 of the Civil Code was applicable to administrative contracts and thereby Perenco was entitled to suspend operations under such principle.\n\n291.\n\nAs regards the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal committed a gross error when concluding that the *exceptio* principle set forth in Article 1568 of the Civil Code applied to administrative contracts. Ecuador further argues that the Tribunal failed to recognize that interruption of hydrocarbons production is prohibited in Ecuadorian Law given that it is considered a public service under the Constitution, and thereby, it is subject to the continuity principle.\n\n292.\n\nThe Committee stresses that it cannot act as a court of appeals and judge whether the Tribunal correctly or incorrectly interpreted or applied the Ecuadorian Law. The Committee may even disagree with the Tribunal's interpretation of the law; however, the fact is that the Tribunal did identify the proper body of law and endeavored to apply it. This can be observed in the Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability between paragraphs 418 and 435. It is not for the Committee to assess whether the interpretation of the Tribunal is merely incorrect or \u201cgrossly incorrect\u201d. The Committee cannot review the substance of the case. Therefore, the Commitee concludes that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers when deciding that the *exceptio* rule applied to administrative contracts and therefore Perenco was entitled to suspend operations under said principle.\n\n293.\n\nAs regards the failure to state reasons, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal's reasoning on its conclusion that Ecuadorian law permits the Party not in breach to suspend performance of its contractual obligations is limited to a two-line sentence in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\n294.\n\nAs a preliminary remark, the Committee notes that Ecuador's claim is based on the argument that the Tribunal's reasoning is insufficient. Yet, as explained in Section III.D.2 above, it is not on the Committee to assess the quality or extension of the reasons provided by the Tribunal. To determine whether the Tribunal complied with the requirement that the Award shall state reasons for its decision, the Committee must analyze whether the Tribunal's conclusions follow from a set of premises, either implicit or explicit.\n\n295.\n\nBetween paragraphs 418 to 425 of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability the Tribunal presented its analysis to resolve the following question: \u201c[c]an Perenco invoke the defence of *exceptio non adempleti contractus* for its decision to suspend operations?\u201d\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis by noting that, having found that Ecuador breached the Participation Contracts by not complying with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the question was whether as a matter of Ecuadorian law Perenco was entitled to suspend performance of its contractual obligations.266 Thereafter, the Tribunal devoted twelve paragraphs to present the opinions of the Parties' legal experts.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 418 (AAE-163).\n\n297.\n\nThe Committee finds that there are two particular references that are paramount to the subsequent Tribunal's conclusion.\n\n298.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal referred to Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose's view on the interpretation of Article 1568 of the Civil Code, as follows:\n\nArticle 1568 of Ecuador's Civil Code provides more generally that \u2018[i]n bilateral contracts no party shall be considered to be in default by failing to comply with the agreed terms, while the other party has not complied with its obligations or refuses to comply in due manner and time.' During cross-examination, Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose asserted that in his view Article 1568 must apply to administrative contracts since it makes no distinction in terms between private and administrative contracts, referring only to the generally worded \u2018contracts.' He referred to the defence as a \u2018transitory' or \u2018transient' right intended to exert pressure on the other contracting party to comply with its contractual obligations. In order to invoke this defence, the invoking party must demonstrate: (i) a reciprocal connection between the obligation breached and the obligation it purports to breach; (ii) that the original breach was material in nature (it cannot relate to ancillary, secondary, or obligations relatively insignificant in the larger context of the legal relationship between the parties); and (iii) that it was or is ready to perform its obligations.267\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 421 (AAE-163).\n\n299.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal referred to certain views presented by Professor Aguilar, as follows:\n\nProfessor Aguilar asserted further that the writers supported his view that the *exceptio* can only apply to administrative contracts in circumstances where the State's conduct has made it \u2018reasonably impossible' for the private contracting entity to fulfill its obligations. [\u2026]\n\nProfessor Aguilar accepted that his view was derived from the views of foreign legal theorists, but asserted that this was necessarily the case as \u2018[t]here has been no explicit development in Ecuador by authors on the subject, nor has a concrete case presented itself that resulted in applicable jurisprudence.' He rejected Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose's reliance on two judicial decisions of the First Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, stating they demonstrated instead that a claim invoking the *exceptio* will not be entertained when the private contractor is itself in default of its contractual obligations. He similarly asserted that contrary to Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose's submission, the two opinions of the Attorney-General in Ecuador demonstrate that the *exceptio* may be invoked by the private contracting entity to an administrative contract, there was in one case a specific contractual provision providing that no fine would be imposed on the contractor for non-performance if the public contracting entity was in default, and the other case supports his view that the *exceptio* did not apply as the \u2018Attorney General argues that a delay in payment by a public institution does not authorize an extension of the contractual term' in favour of the contractor (i.e., permitting non-performance for a time until payment is received).268\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 425-426 (AAE-163).\n\n300.\n\nBased on the foregoing premises, the Tribunal concluded that:\n\nHaving considered the parties' submissions, although it accepts Professor Aguilar's view that the law is not well developed in this point in Ecuador, the Tribunal finds that the defence may be invoked by a private party to an administrative contract. Article 1568 of the Civil Code is worded in general terms and does not support the position that it may only be invoked by the public contracting entity that is party to the contract.269\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 431 (AAE-163).\n\n301.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee observes that, read as a whole and in context, the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability provides reasons supporting the Tribunal's conclusion that Ecuadorian law permits the Party not in breach to suspend performance of its contractual obligations. Thus, the Committee finds no ground to annul under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(3) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that Decree 662 breached the Participation** **Contracts and that the enactment of Decree 662 and the ensuing measures breached Article 4 of the Treaty**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n302.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based, when it decided that the enactment of Decree 662\u2014 increasing to 99% the levy on extraordinary revenue above the reference prices underlying the Participation Contracts\u2014, breached said Contracts.270\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 321.\n\n303.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador notes that the Tribunal failed to apply Ecuadorian administrative law when finding that Decree 662 was not a lawful exercise of the *jus variandi* power under Ecuadorian law. Ecuador stresses that, under Ecuadorian law, the *jus variandi* power is only relevant when the terms of an administrative contract have been modified. Nonetheless, the *jus variandi* power had no bearing in the present case, as the Tribunal itself had found that neither Law 42 nor Decree 662 modified the terms and conditions of the Participation Contracts.271 Ecuador further claims that the Tribunal assessed whether Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts pursuant to a mandate akin to that of an *amiable compositeur* or *ex aequo et bono*. Ecuador thereby contends that the Tribunal's misapplication of Ecuadorian law is so egregious that it amounts to a non-application.272\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 325.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 327-328.\n\n304.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador observes that in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal held both that Law 42 did not amount to a breach of the Participation Contracts, and that Decree 662 was \u201centirely different\u201d and amounted to such a breach. Ecuador remarks that \u201cwhere it is not possible to follow a tribunal's reasoning because the stated reasons are so contradictory as to cancel each other out, this amounts to a failure to state reasons. Likewise, *ad hoc* committees have consistently held that \u2018frivolous' or arbitrary reasoning amounts to a failure to state reasons warranting annulment. In the present case, the Tribunal's reasoning is replete with contradictory findings that cannot be reconciled. It is also based on arbitrary statements that cannot form the basis of a reasoned decision.\u201d273\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 341.\n\n305.\n\nLikewise, Ecuador argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based when it decided that moving beyond 50% to 99% with the application of Decree 662 breached Article 4 of the Treaty.\n\n306.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador contends that the Tribunal's holding that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts was based on a gross misapplication of Ecuadorian law. The Tribunal \u201cerroneously invoked, and limited its assessment of the alleged contractual breach to, the *jus variandi* power under Ecuadorian law even though such principle was plainly inapplicable in the circumstances, thereby assessing whether Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts pursuant to a mandate akin to that of an *amiable compositeur* or *ex aequo et bono*. In so doing, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\u201d274\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 347.\n\n307.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal's holding that \u201cthe application of Decree 662 to Perenco as well as the ensuing measures\u201d breached Article 4 of the Treaty is based on contradictory and arbitrary reasoning, which amounts to failure to state reasons. To support its position, Ecuador advances similar arguments to the ones presented in regard to the finding that Ecuador breached the Participation Contracts by enacting Decree 662.275\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 375; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 213-218.\n\n308.\n\nAccordingly, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Tribunal's findings that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts and that Decree 662 and the ensuing measures breached Article 4 of the Treaty. Likewise, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Tribunal's ensuing decision to order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco.276\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 342.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n309.\n\nPerenco objects Ecuador's position that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state its reasons when concluding that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts and that Decree 662 and the ensuing measures breached Article 4 of the Treaty.277\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 177.\n\n310.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Perenco notes that Ecuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers because it misapplied Ecuadorian law when finding that the *jus variandi* doctrine applied to Decree 662, and that such an error of law cannot constitute a ground for annulment. The Tribunal did apply the Ecuadorian law. Ecuador's argument that the \u201cTribunal erroneously invoked the *jus variandi* power under Ecuadorian law\u201d cannot amount to a manifest excess of power since a mere substantive error cannot qualify as such manifest excess. Furthermore, Ecuador mischaracterizes the Tribunal's reasoning. The Applicant claims that the Tribunal \u201cerroneously invoked the *jus variandi* power under Ecuadorian law\u201d \u201cin circumstances where the *jus variandi* principle is plainly inapplicable\u201d because Law 42 did not unilaterally amend the Participation Contracts. This assertion is false because the Tribunal *did* find that Decree 662 effectively amended the Participation Contracts.278\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 180-181; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 121-129.\n\n311.\n\nEcuador's proposition that the Tribunal also manifestly exceeded its powers when finding that Decree 662 and ensuing measures violated the FET standard in Article 4 of the Treaty is doomed to fail because it is based on the false argument that the Tribunal's holding on the contract claim is incorrect. In any event, even if the Tribunal's finding were incorrect, the Tribunal endeavored to apply the applicable law\u2014the Treaty\u2014when assessing the Treaty claim, therefore, it could not have manifestly exceeded its powers.279\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 183-184.\n\n312.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Perenco notes that the Tribunal's holding that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts and the Treaty is consistent with its finding that Law 42 at 50% did not similarly violate Ecuador's obligations. Among other contentions, Perenco further stresses that Ecuador's challenge to the Tribunal's finding that Decree 662 was a coercive act that was fundamentally different from Law 42 at 50% is no basis for annulment.280\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 187-192.\n\n313.\n\nAccordingly, Perenco contends that Ecuador failed to establish that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers or failed to state reasons when finding that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts and Decree 662, along with ensuing measures, violated Article 4 of the Treaty.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons for deciding that Ecuador's enactment of Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts and that the enactment of Decree 662 and the ensuing measures breached the Treaty.\n\n315.\n\nThe Committee will first address Ecuador's claim regarding the Tribunal's finding that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts.\n\n316.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal erroneously applied the *jus variandi* power under Ecuadorian Law considering that the terms of the Participation Contracts were not modified and therefore said principle was not applicable. Also, the Tribunal assessed whether Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts pursuant to a mandate akin to that of an *amiable compositeur*.281\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 324-327.\n\n317.\n\nThe Committee notes that Ecuador does not claim that the Tribunal failed to apply Ecuadorian law but that it misapplied Ecuadorian law. Yet, the Committee's task is limited to review whether the Tribunal identified the proper body of law and endeavored to apply it.\n\n318.\n\nIn this regard, the Committee observes that in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal expressly identified Ecuadorian law as the applicable body of law:\n\nBoth Contracts were negotiated within the broader context of Ecuadorian law. Clause 22.1 (in both Contracts) stated that the Contract was governed exclusively by Ecuadorian legislation, and the laws in force at the time of its execution were understood to be incorporated in it. The \u2018Legal Framework' then set out a non-exhaustive list of \u2018legal standards' applicable to the Contract (including the Hydrocarbons Law, the Law amending the Hydrocarbons Law and various regulations pertaining thereto, as well as certain other general Ecuadorian laws).282\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 356 (AAE-163).\n\n319.\n\nThereafter, to determine whether Ecuador lawfully exercised its *jus variandi* power when enacting Decree 662, the Tribunal applied the *jus variandi* principle, recognized in Ecuadorian law, and the four-prong test on *jus variandi* referred to by Ecuador's Constitutional Court in its Decision on Law 42.283\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 404-406 (AAE-163).\n\n320.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee finds that the Tribunal identified the proper law and endeavored to apply it. Ecuador disagrees with the Tribunal's interpretation, but the Committee cannot not substitute itself for the Tribunal and assess whether it correctly or incorrectly applied the *jus variandi* principle when examining the lawfulness of Law 42 at 50%.284 Thus, it finds that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers when concluding that the enactment of Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 404-406 (AAE-163).\n\n321.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador contends that the Tribunal's reasoning is so contradictory, and that some of the reasons provided are so \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cfrivolous\u201d that the reasoning amounts to a failure to state reasons.\n\n322.\n\nThe Committee will begin by addressing the alleged \u201ccontradictions\u201d in the Tribunal's reasoning. Ecuador refers to four alleged contradictions.\n\n323.\n\nFirst, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal found, on the one hand, that the Participation Contracts did not preclude Ecuador from introducing new taxes and that Law 42 was a tax modification, and on the other hand, it concluded that Law 42 at 99% was a \u201cconceptual modification of the Participation Contracts.\u201d285 The Committee, however, finds no contradiction on the Tribunal's reasoning.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 331; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 182-184.\n\n324.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal clearly indicated that Law 42 at 50% did not breach the Participation Contracts:\n\n(i) Law 42 fell within the taxation modification clauses of both Contracts; (ii) as the party claiming that the law had an impact on the Contracts' economy, it was incumbent upon Perenco to pursue negotiations with the new administration at least until they were shown to be futile; and (iii) Perenco did not do so, preferring instead to adopt a \u2018wait and see' approach with the new Correa Administration. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not find a breach of clauses 11.12 and 11.7 of the two Contracts.286\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 400 (AAE-163).\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal then analyzed whether Law 42 at 99% was also lawful. The Tribunal, observed that \u201c[t]he situation in relation to the application of Decree 662 to Perenco is entirely different because of the magnitude of the \u2018extraordinary revenues' claimed by the State and the demands made around the time of the decree's promulgation and thereafter that Perenco migrate to a service contract.\u201d287 The Tribunal then applied the four-prong test analyzed by Ecuador's Constitutional Court in its Decision on Law 42, finding that Decree 662 did not comply with limbs (i) and (ii):\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Law 42 at 99% constituted a breach of contract. Having regard to limb (i), in the Tribunal's view, there was no possible reasonable justification for the State to claim 99% of \u2018extraordinary revenues' above the reference price. While the nature of a \u2018deviation of power' is not precisely defined, the writings of the civil law theorists cited by Dr. P\u00e9rez Loose indicate that it concerns the misuse of power. In the Tribunal's view, Decree 662 constituted an act of coercion when viewed within the context of the parties' contractual relations and therefore it can be regarded to be a deviation of power. [\u2026]\u201d\n\nLimb (ii) was also violated. In the Tribunal's view, as of 4 October 2007, Perenco's Contracts were participation contracts in name only; Decree 662 completely modified the Contracts' objective as it was understood under Ecuadorian law. It follows that Decree 662 cannot be justified as a lawful exercise of the *jus variandi* power under Ecuadorian law.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 402 (AAE-163).\n\n326.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal concluded that:\n\n[I]n moving beyond 50% up to 99% the Respondent breached the Participation Contracts. Whatever might have transpired in clause 11 negotiations on the impact of Law 42 at 50% on the Contracts' economy (had they occurred), moving from 50% to 99%, in the Tribunal's view, was no longer an attempt to claim an equitable distribution of the windfall revenues generated by an unexpected and significant increase in oil prices, and could not be justified under the applicable Ecuadorian legal standards for the exercise of the *jus variandi* power.288\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 411 (AAE-163).\n\n327.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that there is no contradiction between the Tribunal's finding that Ecuador did not breach the Participation Contracts by enacting Law 42 at 50%, and its finding that Decree 662 did violate the Participation Contracts. For the Tribunal, the former lawfully fitted within the taxation modification clauses, while the latter constituted an act of coercion and completely modified the Contracts' objective. Since the Tribunal drew a clear distinction between Law 42 at 50% and Law 42 at 99%, no contradiction arises between the Tribunal's propositions.\n\n328.\n\nSecond, Ecuador contends that, in respect of Law 42, the Tribunal found, on the one hand, that Perenco failed to resort to the taxation modification mechanisms in Clauses 11.12 and 11.7 of the Participation Contracts, and on the other hand, it found that Perenco's failure to resort to the aforementioned taxation modification mechanism was irrelevant to assessing whether or not Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts.289\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 332; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 185-187.\n\n329.\n\nThe Committee finds no contradiction between the Tribunal's findings given that, as explained above, the Tribunal clearly distinguished Law 42 at 50% and at 99%. As noted by the Tribunal in relation to the enactment of Decree 662,\n\n[T]his was no longer a question of the State seeking an adjustment of an otherwise acceptable contractual relationship which, in its view, had been disrupted by price increases of an unanticipated magnitude. Rather, Law 42 at 99% unilaterally converted the Participation Contracts into *de facto* service contracts while the State developed a new model of such contracts which it demanded the contractor to sign.290\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 409 (AAE-163).\n\n330.\n\nTherefore, for the Tribunal given that Law 42 at 99% was no longer an attempt to claim an equitable distribution of the windfall revenues and, on the contrary, was an act of coercion, it would have been futile to pursue a negotiation after the enactment of Decree 662. Accordingly, the Tribunal considered that to analyze whether Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts, it was irrelevant whether Perenco had pursued the taxation modification process for Law 42 at 50%.291\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 402-411 (AAE-163).\n\n331.\n\nThird, Ecuador argues that the Tribunal found, on the one hand, that Decree 662 did not impair Perenco's rights of ownership and control over its investment, and on the other hand, held that Decree 662 modified the terms of the Participation Contracts.292\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 333; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 188-189.\n\n332.\n\nThe Committee does not see how the Tribunal's finding that Decree 662 was not an impairment to Perenco's ownership and control over its investment contradicts the conclusion that Decree 662 modified the terms of the Participation Contracts. The Committee does not find that both propositions cannot stand together, much less that they cannot be both true. Therefore, the Committee finds no contradiction amounting to a failure to state reasons.\n\n333.\n\nFourth, Ecuador states that the Tribunal concluded that \u201cDecree 662 did not amount to a \u2018complete or very substantial deprivation of the [\u2026] rights in the totality of the investment,' which were derived from the Participation Contracts,\u201d293 and on the other hand, held that Decree 662 converted the Participation Contracts into *de facto* service contracts.294\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 334.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 334; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 190-191.\n\n334.\n\nAkin to the preceding reasoning, the Committee does not find that the Tribunal's propositions cannot stand together or that both cannot be true. The Committee does not see any contradiction between both premises, much less a contradiction amounting to a failure to state reasons.\n\n335.\n\nIn sum, the Committee considers that there are no contradictions in the Tribunal's reasoning that amount to a failure to state reasons, and thereby rejects Ecuador's contentions on the matter.\n\n336.\n\nNow, the Committee will address the Tribunal's alleged \u201cfrivolous\u201d or \u201carbitrary\u201d reasoning. Ecuador claims that the Tribunal's statements (i) that Decree 662 \u201cwas no longer an attempt to claim an equitable distribution of the windfall revenues,\u201d295 and (ii) that \u201cthe invocation by Perenco of the tax modification clauses in the Participation Contracts would have been futile,\u201d296 are arbitrary. The Committee observes, however, that Ecuador is actually contesting the quality and sufficiency of the Tribunal's reasoning. As explained, in Section III.D.2 above, the Committee is not competent to assess the quality, consistency or extension of the Tribunal's reasoning. The Committee already established that the Tribunal stated its reasons when concluding that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts; therefore, it finds no failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 336.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 339.\n\n337.\n\nThe Committee will turn to address Ecuador's claim that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state its reasons when deciding that Decree 662 and the ensuing measures breached the Treaty.\n\n338.\n\nAs regards the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador alleges that the Tribunal \u201c(i) erroneously invoked, and limited its assessment of the alleged contractual breach to, the *jus variandi* power under Ecuadorian law even though such principle was plainly inapplicable in the circumstances, thereby (ii) assessing whether Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts pursuant to a mandate akin to that of an *amiable compositeur* or *ex aequo et bono*.\u201d297\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 347.\n\n339.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers when deciding that Decree 662 breached the Treaty. The Tribunal identified the proper law\u2014the Treaty\u2014 and endeavored to apply such law.\n\n340.\n\nBetween paragraphs 556 and 564, the Tribunal analyzed the scope and contours of the standard of fair and equitable treatment provided in Article 4 of the Treaty. Thereafter, the Tribunal proceeded to analyze the facts of the case, including the enactment of Decree 662, in the light of such standard. After conducting its analysis, the Tribunal concluded that \u201c(i) Law 42's enactment did not breach Article 4; (ii) moving beyond 50% to 99% with the application of Decree 662 to Perenco as well as the ensuing measures [\u2026] breached Article 4.\u201d298 Accordingly, to assess whether the Tribunal correctly or incorrectly interpreted or applied Article 4 of the Treaty is not on the Committee. Thus, it concludes that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers when finding that Decree 662 and the ensuing measures breached Article 4 of the Treaty.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 627 (AAE-163).\n\n341.\n\nAs regards the failure to state reasons, Ecuador argues that \u201cthe Tribunal's holding that \u2018the application of Decree 662 to Perenco as well as the ensuing measures' breached Article 4 of the Treaty is based on contradictory and arbitrary reasoning.\u201d299\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 350.\n\n342.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal's reasoning is based on a contradiction because it concluded, on the one hand, that Perenco had failed to resort to the tax modification clauses under the Participation Contracts in respect of Law 42, and, on the other hand, it failed to apply this finding to its assessment of whether Decree 662 breached the Treaty.300 For the same reasons explained in paragraphs 327, 328 and 329 *supra*, the Committee finds no contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning, much less a contradiction that amounts to a failure to state reasons.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 351.\n\n343.\n\nEcuador further argues that the Tribunal's conclusion that the invocation by Perenco of the tax modification clauses would have been futile is unsupported and thereby the Tribunal's finding that Decree 662 breached the Treaty is arbitrary. The Committee observes, however, that Ecuador's claim is one of substance: it is based on the quality of the Tribunal's reasoning. The fact that Ecuador does not agree with the Tribunal's finding does not mean that the Tribunal did not state the reasons for concluding that invoking the tax modification clauses would have been futile after Decree 662. In fact, the Tribunal explained that the enactment of Decree 662 was an act of coercion, not an attempt to claim an equitable distribution of the windfall revenues, and therefore invoking the tax modification clauses would have been futile. Thus, the Committee finds that the ground set out in Article 52(1)(e) is not met.\n\n344.\n\nBased on the foregoing the Committee concludes that the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers nor failed to state its reasons when deciding that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts and that the enactment of Decree 662 and the ensuing measures breached Article 4 of the Treaty.\n\n**(4) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that Ecuador's declaration of** ***caducidad*** **breached the Block 21 Participation Contract and expropriated Perenco's contractual rights**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n345.\n\nEcuador argues that the Tribunal's decision that the declaration of *caducidad* effected an expropriation and breached the Block 21 Contract constitutes a manifest excess of powers and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.301\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 358.\n\n346.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador contends that the Tribunal's holding that Ecuador's declaration of *caducidad* breached both the Block 21 Participation Contract and the Treaty is based on a flagrant misapplication of Ecuadorian law. According to Ecuador, \u201cit was not for the Tribunal to place itself in the shoes of the Ministry and, with the benefit of hindsight, hypothesize that, if it had been the Ministry, it could, and would have, waited before declaring *caducidad*. Rather, having found that the Ministry (i) was lawfully entitled to declare *caducidad* and (ii) acted within the bounds of that discretion, the Tribunal was neither required nor permitted, under Ecuadorian law, to review the Ministry's exercise of its lawful discretion.\u201d302 The error committed by the Tribunal in interpreting Ecuadorian law violates the basic distinction between private and public law. Such grave error amounts to a non-application of Ecuadorian law.303\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 366.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 368.\n\n347.\n\nAs to the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Ecuador observes that the Tribunal found that Ecuador's declaration of *caducidad* breached both the Treaty and the Participation Contracts without having heard either Party on this topic and without ever giving the Parties the opportunity to address the Tribunal on the scope or exercise of the Ministry's discretion to declare *caducidad* under Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law. In so doing, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.304\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 359-363.\n\n348.\n\nEcuador requests that the Committee annul the Tribunal's decisions to (i) uphold Perenco's claim of breach of the Block 21 Contract as a result of the declaration of *caducidad*, and (ii) uphold Perenco's claim that the declaration of *caducidad* constituted a breach of Article 6 of the Treaty. Likewise, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Tribunal's ensuing decision to order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco, insofar as it includes Perenco's breach of the Block 21 Contract claim and Perenco's breach of Article 6 of the Treaty claim.305\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 369.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n349.\n\nPerenco claims that the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers, nor seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, when it found that Ecuador's unilateral termination of Perenco's contractual rights by declaring *caducidad* breached the Block 21 Participation Contract and expropriated Perenco in violation of the Treaty.306\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 193.\n\n350.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Perenco stresses that the Tribunal evidently endeavored to apply the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law to conclude that Ecuador had the discretion, but not the obligation, to declare *caducidad*. Likewise, the Tribunal endeavored to apply the Treaty when holding that Ecuador had expropriated Perenco's rights. Ecuador's disagreement with the substance of the conclusion is no basis to find an annullable error.307\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 195-196; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 145-151.\n\n351.\n\nAs to the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Perenco notes that although Ecuador asserts that it did not have an opportunity to address the Tribunal's holding that the Ministry's power to declare *caducidad* under Ecuadorian law was discretionary, the Tribunal's decision was based on Ecuador's own interpretation of the applicable law and both Parties argued this issue throughout the arbitration. Also, Perenco states that the Tribunal may conduct its own analysis and \u201cis not limited by the arguments made by the parties when its interpretation, unlikely to be surprising to either party, is drawn from the terms of the provision which have been discussed by the parties.\u201d308 Thus, Ecuador's claim is factually incorrect and legally insufficient to establish a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.309\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 157.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 152-158.\n\n352.\n\nAccordingly, Ecuador failed to establish that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and seriously violated a fundamental rule of procedure when it found that *caducidad* breached the Block 21 Participation Contract and expropriated Perenco's rights in violation of Article 4 of the Treaty.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure when finding that that Ecuador's unilateral termination of Perenco's contractual rights by declaring *caducidad* breached the Block 21 Participation Contract and expropriated Perenco in violation of the Treaty.\n\n354.\n\nAs regards the manifest excess of powers, the Committee observes that Ecuador does not contest that the Tribunal properly identified the applicable law but considers that the Tribunal misapplied such law. As explained in Section III.B.2 above, a misapplication of the proper law, regardless of how \u201cerroneous\u201d it could be, is not a basis for annulment under Article 52(1)(b).\n\n355.\n\nThe Committee observes from the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that the Tribunal identified the proper law, that is the Hydrocarbons Law and the Treaty, and endeavored to apply it. In paragraph 706 of said decision, the Tribunal expressly referred to the Hydrocarbons Law and presents its interpretation thereof:\n\nWhile it accepts that the State had the right to intervene and operate the blocks, the Tribunal does not accept that the State was bound to bring the Claimant's contracts to an end by means of a caducidad declaration. The Tribunal notes in this regard that under Chapter IX of the Hydrocarbons Law, Article 74, the Ministry \u2018may declare the caducidad of contracts, if the contractor' engages in any of thirteen different types of acts including suspending operations \u2018without cause justifying it, as determined by PETROECUADOR.' The Tribunal attaches particular importance to the fact that the opening phrase of Article 74 is expressed in permissive rather than mandatory terms. That is, the Ministry is empowered to declare the caducity of contracts in any of the specified circumstances, but it is not obliged to do so.310\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability,\u00b6 706 (AAE-163).\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal then explains why, under its interpretation of the Hydrocarbons Law, the *caducidad* declaration breached Article 6 of the Treaty and the Block 21 Contract:\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Ecuador's submission that this was not done without fair warning to the Consortium. The Ministry and Petroecuador wrote to the Consortium on four occasions requesting it to resume operations and warned that a failure to do so could lead to the termination of their Contracts.\n\nBut in all the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal considers that the Ministry should have stayed its hand and awaited the outcome of this arbitration. It was not contrary to Article 6 for Ecuador to have continued to operate the oilfields in the face of the Claimant's refusal to return until the *coactiva* matter had been addressed to its satisfaction. But the decision to initiate caducity proceedings and thereby bring Perenco's contractual rights to an end during the midst of this arbitration leads the Tribunal to find a breach of Article 6.[\u2026]\n\n[T]he Ministry had the discretion not to commence *caducidad* proceedings and it is the Tribunal's judgment that this discretion should have been exercised in favour of not pursuing caducidad while the Parties' respective rights and obligations were being determined in this proceeding. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that as of the date of *caducidad* having been declared and the Consortium's interests were finally brought to an end, the Respondent effected an expropriation of Perenco's contractual rights contrary to Article 6 of the Treaty. This is the date of the expropriation; for the reasons given above, the Tribunal rejects the creeping expropriation argument advanced by Perenco.\n\nThis declaration of caducity was for the same reason equally a breach of the Block 21 Contract because, having occupied the blocks in order to safeguard the oilfields, it was unnecessary for the Ministry to then bring the Contract to an end.311\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 707-708, 710 (AAE-163).\n\n357.\n\nConsidering that the Tribunal properly identified the applicable law and endeavored to apply it, and that what Ecuador really pleads is a disagreement with the interpretation of the Tribunal, the Committee finds no manifest excess of the powers of the Tribunal.\n\n358.\n\nAs regards the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Ecuador argues that the Tribunal breached the Applicant's right to be heard by holding that the *caducidad* declaration breached the Block 21 Participation Contract and the Treaty on the basis of a proposition that \u201cneither Party had advanced or had the opportunity to comment upon.\u201d312 Yet, the Committee considers that the Tribunal did not depart from the Parties' right to be heard.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 359.\n\n359.\n\nAs a starter, the Committee observes that Ecuador does not contest that both Parties had the opportunity to present their case on the interpretation and application of the Hydrocarbons Law, particularly on Article 74 thereof. Ecuador's claim is based on the allegation that the Tribunal departed from the Parties' submissions and adopted its own interpretation of the law. In this regard, the Committee finds that, although the Tribunal's interpretation of the Hydrocarbons Law was not expressly advanced by either Party, the discretion of the Ministry to declare *caducidad* was referred to by the Legal Expert presented by Ecuador, Mr. Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade,313 the Tribunal did not depart from the legal framework argued during the arbitration.\n\nFourth Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, July 26, 2012, \u00b6 20 (CEA-084).\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion was not based on a novel legal framework, it was based on the interpretation and application of the Hydrocarbons Law, amply debated by the Parties. As noted in Section III.C.2 above, as long as the Tribunal's analysis is framed within the legal framework argued during the arbitration, the Tribunal may conduct its own analysis of the evidence available in the record and reach a different conclusion if it is not satisfied with the Parties' interpretation of the applicable law. Accordingly, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not breach Ecuador's right to be heard when deciding that the declaration of *caducidad* breached the Treaty and Block 21 Contract.\n\n361.\n\nIn sum, the Committee concludes that by finding that the *caducidad* declaration breached both the Treaty and Block 21 Contract, the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers, nor seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**C. G****rounds on the** **T****ribunal****'****s findings on damages**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nBefore assessing each of the specific grounds advanced by Ecuador on the Tribunal's findings on damages, the Committee considers necessary to briefly refer to an issue debated by the Parties in their written and oral pleadings: the scope and contours of the arbitral Tribunal's discretion when calculating damages in an ICSID arbitration.\n\n363.\n\n*Ad hoc* committees have consistently recognized that tribunals have a considerable measure of discretion in deciding issues of quantum.314\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment, November 2, 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 412, 417 (AALA-061); *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, \u00b6 91 (AALA-046); *UAB E ENERGIJA (LITHUANIA) v. Republic of Latvia*, ICISD Case No. ARB/12/33, Decision on Annulment, April 8, 2020 (AALA-110).\n\n364.\n\nAs noted by the *Rumeli ad hoc* committee:\n\n[T]he tribunal must be satisfied that the claimant has suffered some damage under the relevant head as a result of the respondent's breach. But once it is satisfied of this, the determination of the precise amount of this damage is a matter for the tribunal's informed estimation in the light of all the evidence available to it.315\n\n*Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16 (Annulment), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, March 25, 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 144-145, and 147 (AALA-086).\n\n365.\n\nAs to the mathematical calculations undertaken by a tribunal, the *Rumeli ad hoc* committee further stated that:\n\nThe Committee well understands the grounds for the Applicant on Annulment's objection in this regard. It is highly desirable that tribunals should minimise to the greatest extent possible the element of estimation in their quantification of damages and maximise the specifics of the ratiocination explaining how the ultimate figure was arrived at. But, nevertheless, the Committee does not consider that the award of damages is one which it ought to annul, since the Tribunal did not fail to give reasons for its award of damages. On the contrary, the Tribunal examined the position as to damages with considerable care and set out the reasons for its award in terms appropriate to the circumstances of the case and the evidence available to it.316\n\n*Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16 (Annulment), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, March 25, 2010, \u00b6 178 (AALA-086).\n\n366.\n\nLikewise, in regard to the allocation of interests, the *Vivendi v. Argentina ad hoc* committee stressed that \u201cthe allocation of interest, like the evaluation of damages, falls within the discretionary power of the Tribunal in the light of all relevant circumstances of the case.\u201d317\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3 (formerly *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. and Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux v. Argentine Republic*), Decision on Annulment, August 10, 2010, \u00b6 256 (AALA-070).\n\n367.\n\nThe Committee shares the point of view of the above mentioned *ad hoc* committees. Arbitral tribunals have a margin of discretion to estimate the quantification of the damages, including the allocation of interest. To meet the duty of stating the reasons for its decisions, an arbitral tribunal need not reveal or explain each mathematical calculation that supports its conclusions. However, tribunals must show the premises leading to their conclusion.\n\n**(1) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that the Parties would have agreed to** **Law 42 being stabilized at 33% as of October 5, 2008**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n368.\n\nEcuador notes that in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal dismissed Perenco's claims regarding Law 42, but upheld its claims regarding Decree 662. The Tribunal concluded that Law 42 fell within the scope of the Participation Contracts' clauses for the negotiation of an adjustment factor if new taxation measures affected the economy of the contracts (the \u201c**Renegotiation Clauses**\u201d). The Tribunal concluded that if Perenco believed that a modification to the tax system had an impact on the economy of the Participation Contracts, it should have raised the issue and pursued negotiation with Ecuador to agree on a correction factor for absorbing that impact\u2014not any general increase in Perenco's tax burden.318 Perenco, however, did not pursue the negotiation process under the Renegotiation Clauses and therefore the Tribunal found no breach of the Participation Contracts. Further, the Tribunal held that increasing the windfall tax rate to 99% by enacting Decree 662 constituted a breach of the Participation Contracts as it \u201cwas no longer an attempt to claim an equitable distribution of the windfall revenues generated by an unexpected and significant increase in oil prices, and could not be justified under the applicable Ecuadorian legal standards for the exercise of the *jus variandi* power.\u201d319 Likewise, it found that Decree 662 constituted a breach to Article 4 of the Treaty.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 372-373.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 375.\n\n369.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal calculated the quantum of the damages to Perenco resulting from Decree 662 under the premise that \u201cafter Decree 662 entered into effect, Perenco would have been prompted to trigger negotiations and the Parties would have agreed to Law 42 being stabilised at 33% starting 5 October 2008, to be applied prospectively, for both contracts.\u201d320 In so doing, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state the reasons upon which its findings were based, and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.321\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 377.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 377.\n\n370.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador claims that in deciding that Law 42's 50% rate would have been stabilized at 33%, the Tribunal awarded Perenco damages for what the Tribunal itself had previously held to be a lawful measure\u2014the enactment of Law 42\u2014 which complied with the Participation Contracts and the Treaty.322 Ecuador further argues that in concluding that the Parties would have agreed to stabilize Law 42 at 33%\u2014below Law 42's 50%\u2014, the Tribunal carried out an irrational assessment of the evidence. The Tribunal also substituted itself for the Parties and proceeded to divine what the outcome of their negotiations would have been and acted *ex aequo et bono*.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 379.\n\n371.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador claims that in deciding that the Parties would have agreed to stabilize Law 42 at 33% as of October 5, 2008, the Tribunal: i) contradicted its own reasoning in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability in such a way that it failed to state any reasons, and ii) failed to state the reasons for such finding.323\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 395.\n\n372.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal's finding that \u201cthe Parties would have agreed to Law 42 being stabilized at 33% starting 5 October 2008, to be applied prospectively, for both contracts\u201d contradicts three of the Tribunal's findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability now vested with *res judicata* effect:324 (1) that \u201cno damages can flow for Law 42 dues at 50%;\u201d325 2) that it was incumbent upon Perenco to pursue negotiations with Ecuador at least until they were shown to be futile and Perenco did not do so;\u201d326 and 3) that it refused to substitute itself to the Parties and divine the outcome of the negotiations, as \u201cit would be wholly speculative for the Tribunal to try to estimate what the parties would have done[;]\u201d moreover, when it lacked Perenco's analysis demonstrating Law 42's impact on the Contracts, and the Parties' determination that the new or modified tax have had an impact on the economy of the Contracts.327\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 396.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 397.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 398.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 399-404.\n\n373.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal did not explain why it concluded that the Parties would have agreed to the stabilization of Law 42 at 33%. Also, by deciding that the Parties would have stabilized the effects of Law 42 at 33%, the Tribunal implicitly decided that Law 42 affected the economy of the Contracts, but it gave no reasons for this finding. Also, the Tribunal gave no explanation as to why Ecuador would accept a windfall tax rate below 50%,328 considering that in the new contracts they were negotiating, the Parties had agreed to increase the rate of the windfall tax from 50% to 70% under the *Ley de Equidad Tributaria*. Finally, there is nothing in the Award explaining why the 33% stabilized windfall tax rate would apply starting on October 5, 2008 as opposed to any other date.329\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 405-412.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 413-416.\n\n374.\n\nAs to the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Ecuador states that by concluding \u201c*sua sponte* to adopt a stabilized rate of 33% for the windfall tax enacted by Law 42, the Tribunal did not afford the Parties an opportunity to comment upon such rate. In so doing, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\u201d330\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 413.\n\n375.\n\nAccordingly, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Tribunal's decision to order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco, insofar as the calculation of such amount is based on the application of Law 42 at 33% as of October 5, 2008.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n376.\n\nPerenco objects Ecuador's position that the Tribunal's holding that by deciding that the Parties would have agreed to stabilize Law 42 at 33%, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state the reasons for its decision, and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.331\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 203.\n\n377.\n\nAs regards the manifest excess of powers, Perenco argues that, in quantifying damages, the Tribunal clearly had the power to determine what would have occurred in the \u2018but for' world had Ecuador not breached the Treaty and Contracts.332 Even under Ecuador's diluted annulment standard, \u201cby determining that the Parties would have agreed to Law 42 at 33%, the Tribunal simply made a factual finding about what would have occurred, on the balance of probabilities, if Ecuador had complied with its obligations under the Treaty and Contracts to \u2018absorb the increase [\u2026] in the tax burden.'\u201d333 In so doing, the Tribunal endeavored to apply international law to fully compensate Perenco.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 205; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 160.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 161.\n\n378.\n\nPerenco further states that the Tribunal did not reopen its previous finding that Perenco did not sufficiently press its rights under the Contracts' absorption clauses to offset Law 42 at 50%.334 Far from re-opening its Liability Decision or granting Perenco \u201cdamages for a lawful measure,\u201d the Tribunal's findings reflected the fact that Perenco had valuable absorption rights under the Contracts and that Perenco would have exercised those rights but for Decree 662.335\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 162.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 209.\n\n379.\n\nWhile Ecuador claims that the Tribunal's factual findings are annullable because it carried out an irrational assessment of the evidence or acted *ex aequo et bono*,336 Perenco recalls that while the Tribunal found that Perenco initially did not \u201ctest\u201d the clauses, it also found that the clauses were not adequately pursued such as to be shown to have been futile until the application of Decree 662 in 2007.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 305-312.\n\n380.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal did not \u201crewrite the facts\u201d by allegedly disregarding that the Parties \u201chad agreed to increase the rate of the windfall tax from 50% (under Law 42) to 70% (under the *Ley de Equidad Tributaria*).\u201d For Perenco, this is a misleading comparison because the 70% rate, expressed in an unconsummated agreement, was based on a much higher reference price of US$42.50/barrel. As Perenco demonstrated with respect to the Block 7 extension damages it sought, \u201cit was roughly equivalent economically (at least under certain price assumptions) to Law 42 with its original reference price at 37.50%.\u201d337 Furthermore, the Tribunal held that this agreement was negotiated under unlawful conditions of duress.338\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 211.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 211.\n\n381.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal's conclusion that in the \u2018but for' world the Parties would have offset Law 42 to 33% was a tenable one, and it certainly was not so \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d that it amounted to a manifest excess of powers.339 It is not for the Committee to second-guess whether the Tribunal correctly ascertained the facts or whether it correctly appreciated the evidence, in particular given that a tribunal has an especially wide margin of discretion in fact-finding when considering damages.340\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 167.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 212.\n\n382.\n\nAs regards the failure to state reasons, Perenco objects to Ecuador's contention that the Tribunal's findings regarding Law 42 at 33% \u201cdirectly contradict\u201d and \u201ccancel out\u201d three of the Tribunal's prior findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability. According to Perenco, the Tribunal's reasons would have to be so genuinely contradictory that they amount to a total absence of reasons, which is an extremely high bar that occurs in extremely rare cases and cannot be lightly assumed.341 Ecuador did not meet this extremely high bar.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 214.\n\n383.\n\nFirst, there is no contradiction between the Tribunal's liability findings on Law 42 at 50% and its decision to grant damages to Perenco under Decree 662. While the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability \u201cprecludes awarding damages for Law 42's effect prior to Decree 662,\u201d beyond Decree 662 \u201cthe Tribunal did *not* pass on what might be considered in the damages phase with respect to the possible exercise of the tax modification clauses.\u201d342 According to Perenco, that was a question for the Tribunal to answer based on the Parties' evidence and submissions on quantum, as it did.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 215; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 169.\n\n384.\n\nSecond, there is no contradiction between the finding that Perenco did not sufficiently test the absorption clauses prior to the enactment of Decree 662, and the finding that it would have relied on the rights it had under those clauses after Decree 662.343\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 216; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 169.\n\n385.\n\nThird, there is no contradiction between the Tribunal declining to determine what absorption rate the Parties would have agreed to under Law 42 at 50%, and the Tribunal finding that Perenco did prove futility after Decree 662 and that \u201cthe evidence as whole\u201d showed that \u2018but for' that futility, the Parties would have agreed to a 33% rate. Perenco notes that \u201cthe \u2018evidence as whole' at the damages phase encompassed multiple additional written briefs, witness statements, expert reports, and two oral hearings discussing precisely what would have occurred but for Ecuador's unlawful conduct.\u201d344\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 217; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 169.\n\n386.\n\nFurthermore, Ecuador's position that the Tribunal failed to state any reasons for its finding that the stabilized rate would have been 33% as of October 2008 ignores the Award. Perenco contends that the Tribunal provided its reasons in paragraphs 366-387, 394-411, 592, 603-627, 686 of the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, and 127-146, 215, 385 of the Award.345\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 218; Tr., Day 1 January 12, 2021, Perenco's Opening Statement, p. 47.\n\n387.\n\nAs regards the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Perenco claims that Ecuador is wrong that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure because it adopted a specific absorption rate that neither Party advanced: Law 42 at 33%. Perenco observes that ICSID arbitration is not \u201cbaseball\u201d arbitration and the right to be heard does not constrain tribunals to adopt the arguments of either one party or another. Perenco further argues that the right to be heard requires that Ecuador have a reasonable opportunity to present its case and Ecuador admits that it had such an opportunity.346\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 219; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 170.\n\n388.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers, fail to state reasons, or seriously depart from a fundamental rule of procedure in finding that the Parties would have agreed to Law 42 at 33%.347\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 220; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 173.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n389.\n\nEcuador claims that in deciding that Law 42's 50% rate would have been stabilized at 33%, the Tribunal awarded Perenco damages for what the Tribunal itself had previously held to be a lawful measure\u2014the enactment of Law 42\u2014which complied with the Participation Contracts and the Treaty, therefore manifestly exceeding its powers. Ecuador further argues that in concluding that the Parties would have agreed to stabilize Law 42 at 33%\u2014 below Law 42's 50%\u2014, the Tribunal carried out an irrational assessment of the evidence and substituted itself for the Parties by proceeding to divine what the outcome of their negotiations would have been and acted *ex aequo et bono*.\n\n390.\n\nEcuador also considers that in deciding that the Parties would have agreed to stabilize Law 42 at 33% as of October 5, 2008, the Tribunal not only contradicted its own reasoning in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability in such a way that it failed to state any reasons, but also failed to state the reasons for such finding.\n\n391.\n\nFinally, according to Ecuador, the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by concluding *sua sponte* to adopt a stabilized rate of 33% for the windfall tax enacted by Law 42 without affording the Parties an opportunity to comment on such rate.\n\n392.\n\nThe Committee stresses that the Award cannot be read in isolation. A review in context with other Decisions of the Tribunal incorporated in the Award\u2014including the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability\u2014is required to determine whether the grounds for annulment invoked by Ecuador should stand. Such review in context requires a review of the timing, elements, and scenarios analyzed by the Tribunal in each instance.\n\n393.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal arrives, *inter alia*, at the following conclusions in relation to the Participation Contracts' stabilization clauses and Law 42:\n\n394.\n\nClauses 11.7 and 11.12 of the Participation Contracts did not preclude the State from introducing new taxes or modifying existing ones, but in the event that measures were introduced that had \u201cconsequences for the economy of\u201d the Contract, the obligation arose to negotiate a \u201ccorrection factor\u201d that would absorb the increase or decrease in the tax burden.348 \u201c[T]he predicate for the introduction of any correction factor was the demonstration (and subsequent agreement of the parties) that the new or modified tax had \u2018consequences for the economy' of the contract; a new or modified tax that did not have such consequences would not require a correction factor.\u201d349 According to the Tribunal, Clause 11 did not stipulate how the correction factor would be calculated; however, it did stipulate the ultimate result, namely, \u201ca change in the parties' respective participations \u2018which absorbs the increase or decrease in the tax burden.' The process envisaged was one of the negotiation in good faith of a mutually agreeable offset that would result in an amended contract.\u201d350\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 362 (AAE-163).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 365 (AAE-163).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 365 (AAE-163).\n\n395.\n\nAs a taxation measure, Law 42 modified the tax regime governing the Participation Contracts with the result that Perenco was entitled to require Petroecuador to engage in negotiations to determine the effects of Law 42 on the economy of the Participation Contracts and to arrive at a consequent correction factor (in the event the Parties agreed that the tax affected the economy of the Contract).351\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 378 (AAE-163).\n\n396.\n\nIt was incumbent upon Perenco to pursue negotiations with the new administration until they were shown to be futile. Yet, Perenco did not do so although it was the Party claiming that Law 42 had an impact on the Participation Contracts' economy.352 The Tribunal acknowledged that any such negotiations would have been challenging given that: (i) Ecuador would have advanced that Law 42 did not have an impact on the economy of the contracts; (ii) the Parties would have debated the meaning of \u201ceconomy of the contract\u201d; (iii) had Perenco submitted its study on its financial performance prior to and after Law 42\u2014which it did not submit at the time\u2014, Petroecuador would have found that Perenco had performed well; and (iv) all the evidence that has been presented by both Parties in the Underlying Arbitration (pricing and profitability expectations at the time of the Contracts' making, general industry expectations of returns on investment, etc.) would have been discussed. Nonetheless, the complexity of such negotiation does not support a finding of futility.353\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 400 (AAE-163).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 393 (AAE-163).\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal did not consider it necessary or appropriate in the circumstances354 to pursue the issue of whether or not Law 42 at 50% affected the economy of the Participation Contracts. If that was the case, the Tribunal was of the view that it was incumbent to Perenco to pursue the procedure set out in Clauses 11.12 of the Block 7 Contract and 11.7 of Block 21.\n\nThe circumstances at the time period being evaluated in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability did not include Decree 662 (which had not been issued) and did not include *caducidad* and the breach resulting from the abrupt termination of the negotiations.\n\n398.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability the Tribunal stated three additional reasons for declining to divine what would have happened in the negotiation should Perenco had invoked Clause 11 under Law 42 at 50%:\n\n399.\n\nFirst, the clause required the Parties to determine whether Law 42 had an impact on the contract's economy, and if so, to calculate an adjustment to absorb that impact. However, the precise means of correction could only be determined through negotiations that arrived at a mutually agreeable outcome (or, if such negotiations foundered, thereafter by a tribunal armed with all of the relevant documentation produced by both Parties during the negotiations).355\n\nIn the view of the Committee this understanding in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability is crucial for the Tribunal's decision in the Award.\n\n400.\n\nSecond, with the passage of time and the absence of critical contemporaneous data, it would be wholly speculative for the Tribunal to try to estimate what the Parties would have done.\n\n401.\n\nThird, Perenco did not produce to the Tribunal the contemporaneous analysis that Perenco prepared to demonstrate the impact of Law 42 on the Participation Contracts.\n\n402.\n\nAs regards Decree 662, the Tribunal decided that in moving beyond 50% up to 99% the Respondent breached the Participation Contracts. In the Tribunal's view, whatever might have transpired in Clause 11 negotiations on the impact of Law 42 at 50% on the economy of the Participation Contract (had they occurred), moving from 50% to 99% was no longer an attempt to claim an equitable distribution of the windfall revenues generated by an unexpected and significant increase in oil prices, and could not be justified under the applicable Ecuadorian legal standards for the exercise of the *jus variandi* power. The Tribunal also concluded that Decree 662 was intended to prompt negotiations with oil companies, and unilaterally converted the Participation Contracts into *de facto* service contracts while the State developed a new model for such contracts.356\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 409-411. (AAE-163).\n\n403.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal proceeded to value the damages caused by Ecuador's breaches. For that purpose, the Tribunal decided to take different valuation dates for Decree 662 and *caducidad*.357 For the first breach (Decree 662), the Tribunal built a \u201cbut for\u201d scenario between October 4, 2007 to July 20, 2010.358 For the second breach (*caducidad*), the Tribunal took an *ex-ante* approach.\n\nAward, \u00b6 77 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 111 (AAE-031).\n\n404.\n\nAs regards a \u201chypothetical tax threshold\u201d between 50% and 99%, the Tribunal considered that Brattle did not explain why such threshold was appropriate when the Tribunal's task was to eliminate Decree 662 in its entirety.359 By rejecting the aforementioned threshold and taking 50% as a departing point of the negotiation envisaged in the \u201cbut for\u201d scenario, the Tribunal eliminated Decree 662.\n\nAward, \u00b6 93 (AAE-031).\n\n405.\n\nWith respect to the question on whether Law 42 would have been completely absorbed, the Tribunal concluded that, consistent with its finding in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, no damages can flow prior to the issuance of Decree 662, that is, before October 4, 2007.360\n\nAward, \u00b6 140 (AAE-031).\n\n406.\n\nOn the above point the Tribunal stated in the Award that in its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability it \u201cdid not pass on what might be considered in the damages phase with respect to the possible exercise of the tax modification clauses (except to note how the contract's provisions were expected to operate).\u201d361 Therefore, at the time of its Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal decided not to engage in determining a \u201cbut for\u201d scenario for a damage quantification and reserved that decision for the damages phase of the arbitration.\n\nAward, \u00b6 140 (AAE-031).\n\n407.\n\nIn the \u201cbut for scenario\u201d for the damages phase in the Award, the Tribunal concluded that if Perenco exercised its contractual rights in the \u2018but for' scenario, Ecuador would have responded in good faith by negotiating an absorption of the additional tax burden. After considering the evidence, the Tribunal found that in the \u2018but for' scenario for the period after Decree 662 came into effect, Perenco would have sought an offset. But having regard to the evidence as whole, the Tribunal was not convinced that Perenco would have sought the complete elimination of Law 42 (which would result in a 0% rate). Rather, it would have sought to undo the effect of Decree 662 and, to the extent reasonably possible, Law 42.\n\n408.\n\nAt paragraph 143 of the Award, the Tribunal explains the reasons why it considers that in the \u2018but for' world, Perenco would have most likely sought a negotiation under the tax modification clauses that would have reduced the State's take of the extraordinary revenues, whilst maximizing the company's chances of its obtaining an extension of its operatorship of Block 7. Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that Perenco's interests in the two Contracts would have been adjusted to Law 42 at 33% as of October 5, 2008 through the expiration of the Participation Contracts (August 2010).\n\n409.\n\nFinally, to arrive at the NPV of the DCF that would have been derived from Blocks 7 and 21, the Tribunal devised the \u201charmonised model,\u201d i.e., the \u201cModel\u201d in the present annulment proceedings. As such, the Tribunal forecasted the production in both Blocks in the two periods already mentioned: 1) between October 4, 2007 and July 20, 2010 (for the first breach under the \u201cbut for\u201d scenario, i.e. with Law 42 at 33% after October 5, 2008362); and (ii) after *caducidad* (on an *ex ante* basis).\n\nFrom the Award it may be inferred that the Tribunal's decision to fix October 5, 2008 as the date after which Law 42 applied at 33% is related to the fact that the last negotiations conducted by the Parties (in which they were apparently negotiating in good faith until before the abrupt termination of the negotiations, which termination the Tribunal considers as a breach) date to October 2008.\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that it used Perenco's contemporaneous NPV calculations of the impact of Law 42 at 50% and 99% as a check of its assessment. These calculations were made after Decree 662 was issued. For the Tribunal, it was good evidence of the Block's estimated value with Law 42 at 50% and 99% at the time of the first breach.363\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 119, 123 (AAE-031).\n\n411.\n\nThe above review of the analysis of the Tribunal in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and the Award leads the Committee to conclude that, for the reasons below, the grounds for annulment invoked by Ecuador in connection with the stabilization of Law 42 and 33% do not stand.\n\n412.\n\nIn relation to the manifest excess of powers ground, it was invoked by Ecuador in two instances, first, arguing that in deciding that Law 42's 50% rate would have been stabilized at 33%, the Tribunal awarded Perenco damages for what the Tribunal itself had previously held to be a lawful measure. Second, that in concluding that the Parties would have agreed to stabilize Law 42 at 33%\u2014below Law 42's 50%\u2014, the Tribunal carried out an irrational assessment of the evidence and substituted itself for the Parties by proceeding to divine what the outcome of their negotiations would have been and acted *ex aequo et bono*.\n\n413.\n\nAs explained above, regarding the first issue, the scenarios that the Tribunal analyzed in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and the Award were different and what the Tribunal \u201cdeclined to divine\u201d in each scenario as regards the negotiations between the Parties are also different. What the Tribunal did in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability was to indicate that it would not make an assessment for purposes of liability in the abstract, which it did not, but did not indicate or suggest that it would not make such assessment during the damages phase for purposes of calculating the damages.\n\n414.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and for purposes of liability before Decree 662 (which had not been issued at the time), the Tribunal only declined to guess what would have happened had Perenco triggered Clause 11 under Law 42 at 50%. In the Award, in turn, the Tribunal determined what would have happened in the \u201cbut for world\u201d, i.e., in a scenario where Decree 662 had been issued, where there was a change in the policies of Ecuador as regards participation contracts, where the negotiations had commenced and were abruptly terminated and where *caducidad* had been declared. Therefore, the Committee sees no contradiction between the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and the Award, as claimed by Ecuador, and no manifest excess of power.\n\n415.\n\nIn relation to the second issue, in the view of the Committee, the finding by the Tribunal in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability that Law 42 at 50% was lawful and did not constitute a breach to the Participation Contracts or the Treaty, did not prevent the Tribunal from analyzing, as it did, what would be the quantum of the damages emerging from the issuance of Decree 662. In other words, under the Tribunal's reasoning read in context, the fact that Law 42 at 50% was declared lawful by the Tribunal under the Treaty or the Participation Contracts did not prevent the Tribunal from considering that in a negotiation in good faith under the \u201cbut for scenario\u201d, excluding Decree 662 and assuming the Parties would have negotiated in good faith on a rate that was acceptable to both and that was not necessarily 50%.\n\n416.\n\nIn sum, the \u201cbut for world\u201d of the Tribunal is one in which: it eliminated the disputed measure Decree 662 and the frustrated negotiation from the equation; assumed therefore that the departing point was a negotiation where Ecuador would have sought no offset despite the 50% provided for in Law 42 (i.e., charge the 50% and not to absorb any impact), and Perenco would have sought an offset (i.e., for Ecuador to assume all the impact as if the 50% did not exist); assumed that the Parties would have interest in maintaining the Blocks (not the same contract but the operation of the Blocks) and thus in reaching an agreement (evidence of the will of the Parties to negotiate is cited elsewhere in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability and the Award) they would have reached an agreement at 33%.\n\n417.\n\nAs regards the claim by Ecuador that the Tribunal carried out an irrational assessment of the evidence and acted *ex aequo et bono*, on the one hand, it is not for *ad hoc* committees to second guess the valuation of the evidence by the arbitral tribunals, and on the other, the exercise of the discretion of a tribunal, as in this case, does not mean that the Tribunal acted *ex aequo et bono*. The Tribunal did not decide *ex aequo et bono*, it applied the law that it had already considered applicable, i.e. the Participation Contracts which, in the absence of Decree 662, would have led to a successful negotiation between the Parties. Again, there is no manifest excess of power in this instance.\n\n418.\n\nNow, Ecuador additionally claims that the Tribunal did not provide reasons for its conclusion that the Parties would have agreed to 33% and as to why the Tribunal picked October 5, 2008.\n\n419.\n\nThe Committee considers that, in addition to the standards that have already been explained in Section III.D.2, which include the possibility of finding implied reasons in the analysis of the Tribunal, three additional points must be considered:\n\n420.\n\nThe Parties in the Underlying Arbitration agreed that their experts would provide the Tribunal with a joint model for calculation of the damages and that reference to such agreement and the joint model would not be included in the Award. The Parties debate whether or not the Tribunal was under the obligation to disclose the joint model to the Parties, but it is not for this Committee to decide such difference. The Award, therefore, does not include, by agreement of the Parties, references to the calculations made on the basis of the joint model. The Tribunal cannot, therefore, be blamed for not being able to refer to such joint model if the numbers in the Award were based on such model.\n\n421.\n\nA \u201cbut for\u201d scenario is a hypothetical scenario, it does not refer to what has occurred but to what may have occurred in the absence of certain measures or conducts. Therefore, a \u201cbut for\u201d scenario requires a certain degree of speculation as it would not be possible to determine with absolute certainty what would have likely occurred absent the measures or the conduct.\n\n422.\n\nAs noted above,364 ICSID tribunals and *ad hoc* committees have consistently held that in determining damages tribunals enjoy a margin of discretion.365\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 362-367 of the present Decision.\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v.

Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16 (Annulment), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, March 25, 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 144-145, and 147 (AALA-086).\n\n423.\n\nIn the instant case, the Committee considers that the reasons for the Tribunal to have picked October 5, 2008 (and not any other date) are implied in the Award. October 2008 corresponds to the period where the \u201c*Actas de Acuerdo Parcial*\u201d were signed and the negotiations terminated (October 3 and 17) and in the \u201cbut for\u201d scenario explained in the Award, the negotiations would have been made in good faith and would have concluded with an agreement.366 The selection of October 5 is within the margin of discretion of the Tribunal to determine the date on which the negotiations would likely have not been terminated if the assumption in the \u201cbut for\u201d scenario of the Award is that the negotiations would have been made in good faith.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 136-137.\n\n424.\n\nWith respect to the selection of 33%, the Committee has already found that in the \u201cbut for\u201d scenario the Tribunal eliminated Decree 662 and assumed that negotiations would be conducted in good faith. The Committee further finds that the Tribunal's decision that Law 42 was legal neither contradicts the Tribunal's findings on the \u201cbut for\u201d scenario nor resulted in an obligation for the Tribunal to consider that a negotiation would necessarily result in a rate of 50%.\n\n425.\n\nThe Award, based on the available evidence, concludes that the Parties would have negotiated and explains that, in the \u201cbut for\u201d scenario, Perenco would have sought an offset, but the Tribunal was not convinced that Perenco would have sought the complete elimination of Law 42 (which would result in a 0% rate), rather it would have sought to undo the effect of Decree 662 and, to the extent reasonably possible, Law 42. In sum, the negotiation in good faith, according to the Award, in a \u201cbut for\u201d scenario, would have resulted in a rate higher than 0% (which could have been the rate should an offset under the Participation Contracts had applied) but lower than 50%.367 The rate of 33% is within the range explained by the Tribunal for the \u201cbut for\u201d scenario and is a tenable figure considering the facts explained in the Award and a reasonable exercise of the discretion of the Tribunal as regards the determination of damages. The Committee finds that there is no failure to state reasons in this regard in the Award.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 141-143 (CAA-043).\n\n426.\n\nTherefore, for the reasons above, the grounds claimed by Ecuador regarding manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons fail.\n\n427.\n\nWith respect to the alleged departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Committee has already found (See Section III.C.2) that a tribunal does not necessarily depart from the right to be heard by not adopting either of the positions raised by the Parties. Tribunals may conduct their own analysis based on the documents, evidence, pleadings, and legal authorities presented by the Parties and reach a conclusion different from the positions submitted by the Parties. The Committee further found that the Tribunal has reached the 33% based on its analysis of the \u201cbut for\u201d world, which implies a degree of reasoned speculation, and in the degree of discretion tribunals have as regards damages. The Committee, therefore, finds that there was no violation of a fundamental rule of procedure for the Tribunal not having requested the opinion of the Parties about the 33% rate.\n\n428.\n\nThe ground related to departure from a fundamental rule of procedure thus fails.\n\n**(2) Grounds on the Tribunal's decision to award value to Perenco's loss of** **opportunity to extend the Block 7 Participation Contract**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n429.\n\nEcuador states that the Tribunal's decision to award US$25 million to Perenco to compensate its loss of opportunity on the extension of its operation of Block 7 constitutes a manifest excess of powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and a failure to state reasons.368\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 417-420.\n\n430.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador contends that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law for two reasons. First, the Tribunal failed to apply the proper method for calculating the value of a lost opportunity, which consists in determining the value of loss or benefit and multiplying it by the probability of such loss or benefit. The Tribunal simply came up with a value, exceeding mere discretion.369 Second, although Perenco neither quantified its alternative loss of opportunity claim, nor estimated the probability of its chance to secure an extension of the term of the Block 7 Participation Contract, the Tribunal awarded it US$25 million to compensate for its lost opportunity. In so doing, the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable evidentiary law, and manifestly exceeded its powers.370\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 422-426.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 429.\n\n431.\n\nAs to the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Ecuador states that because Perenco neither quantified its loss of opportunity claim nor estimated the probability of its chance to secure an extension of the term of the Block 7 Participation Contract, Ecuador never had the opportunity to debate either issue and therefore the Tribunal violated its right to be heard.371\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 431-432.\n\n432.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, the Tribunal did not provide a single line of reasoning as to its calculation of the hypothetical loss or benefit, and the probability of such loss of benefit occurring.\n\n433.\n\nEcuador thereby requests that the Committee annul the Tribunal's decision to order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco, to the extent that the calculation of such amount includes the value of Perenco's lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 Participation Contract.372\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 438.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n434.\n\nPerenco objects Ecuador's position that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons, and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by granting Perenco US$25 million for the lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 Contract. According to Perenco, the Tribunal had discretion to determine the appropriate measure of damages to compensate Perenco, without having to apply a specific-mathematical formula, for a proven valuable asset that Perenco would likely have obtained \u2018but for' Ecuador's wrongful acts.373\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 221; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 174.\n\n435.\n\nAs regards the manifest excess of powers, Perenco contends that Ecuador failed to demonstrate that under the applicable law the Tribunal lacked discretion and had to apply a specific-mathematical formula to calculate the damages emerging from Perenco's loss of opportunity.374 In the Award, the Tribunal carefully analyzed the law on loss of chance, including the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, investment treaty decisions such as *Gemplus* and *Murphy*, and damages commentators such as Ripinsky & Williams. According to Perenco, these sources confirm that the standard of full reparation does not determine the valuation methodology and thereby the Tribunal enjoyed a large margin of appreciation to assess Perenco's loss of chance damages, including through an \u201cequitable quantification of the harm sustained.\u201d375\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 223-226; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 176-177.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 176.\n\n436.\n\nAlthough Ecuador claims that the law on the calculation of loss of opportunity requires (i) determining the value of the loss or benefit, and (ii) multiplying it by the probability of such loss or benefit occurring, it has not identified a single authority supporting its contention that tribunals must apply this formula.376 In any event, if the Tribunal had applied Ecuador's proposed mathematical formula, it should have granted Perenco damages that were at least 51% of US$626 million, that is US$319 million at a minimum.377\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 177.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 181.\n\n437.\n\nIn relation to the existence of Perenco's loss, the Tribunal found that \u201c\u2018but for the breaches, the parties more likely than not' would have extended the Block 7 Participation Contract, including because (i) Block 7 was a proven field with valuable oil reserves; (ii) there is no question Perenco wanted to stay in Ecuador; and Perenco submitted \u2018substantial' and \u2018considerable' evidence showing that the State itself would have preferred Perenco to stay in Ecuador.\u201d378\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 228.\n\n438.\n\nAs regards the failure to state reasons, Perenco argues that Ecuador's claims are misplaced because the Tribunal did not have to develop a mathematical calculation to determine the damages Perenco is entitled to for its proven loss of opportunity to extend its operatorship in Block 7. Ecuador's claims are also false because the Tribunal explained that the probability of Perenco's loss occurring was greater than 50% and confirmed that there was \u201ca substantial body of evidence on the record\u201d supporting Perenco's contention that it would have obtained an extension in Block 7 \u2018but for' Ecuador's wrongful acts. According to Perenco, the Tribunal's reasons are provided in paragraphs 206-222, 312 -326 of the Award.379\n\nTr., Day 1 January 12, 2021, Perenco's Opening Statement, p. 47.\n\n439.\n\nAs regards the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Perenco contends that Ecuador's position is flawed because Ecuador had ample opportunity to debate both the probability of Perenco's chance to secure an extension and the quantification of such lost opportunity. Yet, Ecuador chose not to rebut either point.380 Although Ecuador states that it was not permitted to address the Tribunal on its \u201cnovel\u201d findings regarding the probability of the extension and the US$25 million, Ecuador had a reasonable and fair opportunity to present its case on Perenco's claim for loss of opportunity.381 Perenco further contends that, contrary to Ecuador's suggestion, the Tribunal was not limited to adopting a figure previously submitted by one of the Parties, nor did it have to give the Parties a draft of the Award for comments.382\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 235.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 188.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 189.\n\n440.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers, fail to state reasons, or seriously depart from a fundamental rule of procedure in finding that Perenco is entitled to damages for its lost opportunity to extend the valuable Block 7 Contract. If, however, the Committee were to apply Ecuador's proposed formula, it would have to multiply the maximum possible damages (US$626 million) by the probability of such loss or benefit occurring (at least 51%), thereby granting Perenco at least US$319 million in loss of chance damages.383\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 191.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal's decision to award US$25 million to Perenco to compensate its loss of opportunity on the extension of its operation of Block 7 constitutes a manifest excess of powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and a failure to state reasons.\n\n442.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, there is an excess of powers because the Tribunal failed to apply the proper method for calculating the value of a lost opportunity\u2014which consists in determining the value of loss or benefit and multiplying it by the probability of such loss or benefit\u2014and because the Tribunal awarded it US$25 million to compensate for its lost opportunity despite the fact that Perenco neither quantified its loss of opportunity claim or estimated the probability of its chance to secure an extension of the Participation Contract.\n\n443.\n\nNowhere in the applicable law is there a mathematical formula to quantify loss of opportunity. As mentioned before, tribunals enjoy a degree of discretion to assess damages and it is not for *ad hoc* committees to question the methodology used by a tribunal to reach its conclusions on damages or to impose a certain method for calculation of the damages. This ground therefore fails.\n\n444.\n\nEcuador claims a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, because Perenco neither quantified its loss of opportunity claim nor estimated the probability of its chance to secure an extension of the term of the Block 7 Participation Contract, and Ecuador never had the opportunity to debate either issue and, therefore, the Tribunal violated its right to be heard.\n\n445.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal was under no obligation to apply a specific end exclusive methodology to calculate the loss of opportunity. It is true that in the Award it did not estimate the probability of Perenco's chance to obtain an extension, but the consequence thereof, as will be analyzed below, is that the decision on this point lacks reasoning not that the Tribunal violated a fundamental rule of procedure. As already stated in Section III.C.2, the Tribunal is not under the obligation to discuss with the Parties every step of its decision making process and can make its own assessment of the evidence, legal authorities, documents, pleadings, expert reports and witness statement presented by the Parties, so long as the Tribunal's decision remains within the legal and factual framework of the debate in the arbitration. The Committee finds no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n446.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal did not provide a single line of reasoning as to its calculation of the hypothetical loss or benefit, and the probability of such loss of benefit occurring. The Committee finds that the premises referred to by the Tribunal in its Award do not lead to the conclusion that the value of the loss of opportunity should be a nominal one and that the nominal value should be US$25 million and therefore agrees that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for such conclusion.\n\n447.\n\nIn the Award the Tribunal accepted that Ecuador had a substantial measure of discretion when it came to deciding whether to grant an extension of the Participation Contract and indicated that in the \u201cbut for\u201d world, an extension would at its best not have entailed an extension of the existing Participation Contract, but rather the Parties would have agreed on a new model.384 The Tribunal remarked that \u201cit is not possible, on the evidence before it, [\u2026] to know what contractual terms might have been arrived at in a successful negotiation but for the unlawful acts.\u201d385\n\nThis is consistent with the Tribunal's reasoning on the Law 42 at 33%.\n\nAward, \u00b6 212 (AAE-031).\n\n448.\n\nThe Tribunal explained that there is an inherent difficulty of choosing a proxy for the Block 7 extension scenario based on the October 2008 *Acta de Acuerdo Parcial* and referred to Perenco's characterization of the *Acta* as a \u201cvague, incomplete and risky substitute contract.\u201d386 The Tribunal further considered that \u201cemploying a services contract like the Block 10 AGIP Contracts as a proxy for what might or might not have been agreed for Block 7 [as proposed by Perenco], is in the end a bridge too far for the Tribunal.\u201d387\n\nAward, \u00b6 215 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 216-217 (AAE-031).\n\n449.\n\nThe Tribunal disregarded Perenco's analysis indicating that \u201cmuch of Perenco's damages analysis is based on what Petroamazonas has done since it assumed operations of the Blocks.\u201d Yet, the Tribunal stated that it \u201cis not convinced that the economics of the operations of Petroamazonas, a State\u2013owned entity, provides an appropriate \u2018apples to apples' comparator of what Perenco would have done in the \u2018but for' scenario.\u201d The Tribunal remarked that the adjudicator must seek to avoid speculative damages.388\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 218-219 (AAE-031).\n\n450.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal rejected Perenco's extension argument as \u201ctoo remote, uncertain and ultimately too speculative, particularly when Perenco itself accepted that it is necessary to use other contractual models as a proxy for what might have been agreed between the Parties.\u201d389 The Tribunal then acknowledged that the Parties might have been unable to reach an agreement or that the State might have decided not to extend the Block 7 Contract. Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that in the present case there is an \u201cinsufficient degree of confidence as to the terms of the contract that might have been concluded such that there could be an estimate of lost cash flows.\u201d390\n\nAward, \u00b6 220 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 220 (AAE-031).\n\n451.\n\nThe Tribunal then turned to the valuation of the loss of opportunity to negotiate an agreement to continue to operate Block 7 until August 2018 and stressed that this exercise differed from valuing the loss of profits expected under an executed contract.391\n\nAward, \u00b6 312 (AAE-031).\n\n452.\n\nThe Tribunal discussed the relevance of the *Gemplus* award and concluded that although it was facing dramatically different factual circumstances than the present case \u201cthe *Gemplus* tribunal highlighted two points on \u2018loss of opportunity' that resonate with the present Tribunal.\u201d First, there was \u201cno certainty or realistic expectation of this project's profitability as originally envisaged, but there was nonetheless a reasonable opportunity\u201d and that \u201copportunity, however small, has a monetary value\u201d at international law. Second, \u201cit would be wrong in principle to deprive or diminish the Claimants of the monetary value of that lost opportunity on lack of evidential grounds when that lack of evidence is directly attributable to the Respondent's own wrongs.\u201d392\n\nAward, \u00b6 316 (AAE-031).\n\n453.\n\nThe Tribunal, after summarizing the facts of the case, concluded that \u2018but for' the breaches the Parties more likely than not would have arrived at a solution whereby Perenco would be operating Block 7 under a different contractual regime. But the Tribunal has also found that it \u201ccannot engage in the kind of speculation about a specific contractual model which would then be married with Mr. Crick's projections in order to arrive at an amount of damages.\u201d393\n\nAward, \u00b6 317 (AAE-031).\n\n454.\n\nQuoting from Perenco's submissions, the Tribunal referred to Ripinsky and Williams's Damages in International Investment Law, where the authors observed:\n\nLoss of chance can thus be used as a tool allowing the injured party to receive some form of compensation for the loss of chance to make profit. In theory, the loss of chance is assessed by reference to the degree of probability of the chance turning out in the plaintiff's favour, although in practice the amount awarded on this account is often discretionary. [\u2026] In some other cases, arbitral tribunals have determined the amount of lost profits in a discretionary manner. Where this lack of numerical support was due to the fact that a tribunal could not estimate the loss of profits with satisfactory precision, such awards may be classified as compensation for the loss of business opportunity. Amounts awarded under this head of damage are likely to be conservative and reflect a tribunal's view of an equitable, reasonable and balanced outcome rather than being a result of a mathematical calculation.394\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 318-319 (AAE-031). Footnotes omitted.\n\n455.\n\nThereafter, the Tribunal stressed that a claim for loss of opportunity is not to be equated to a lost profits claim based upon a final, executed contract, because in the former there is an element of uncertainty that must be taken into consideration.395\n\nAward, \u00b6 320 (AAE-031).\n\n456.\n\nThe Tribunal proceeded then to mention that in arriving at its decision, it considered the ILC Articles, particularly Article 36, and the commentaries (specifically (27) and (32) thereto) to conclude that financial damage must not only be proximately caused by the unlawful act(s), but that it also be \u201cassessable\u201d, that is, capable of being assessed and seek to avoid granting \u201cinherently speculative\u201d claims or to put it the other way, seek to determine whether there are \u201csufficient attributes to be considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable.\u201d396\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 321-322 (AAE-031).\n\n457.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal, the circumstances of the case are unusual. \u201cThe parties arrived at an \u2018in principle' negotiated change to their contractual relationship which contemplated the extension of Block 7's term. However, it was Ecuador, and not Perenco, which, due to Burlington's recalcitrance, balked at its implementation. The Tribunal found this refusal was a breach of the Treaty by Ecuador which deprived Perenco of the chance to reach an agreement on extension. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that Perenco is entitled to compensation for the loss of that opportunity.\u201d397\n\nAward, \u00b6 323 (AAE-031).\n\n458.\n\nThe Tribunal thereafter \u201cfrankly acknowledges that any estimation of the value of the loss of opportunity is an exercise of discretion and therefore it has decided to award a nominal value\u201d.398\n\nAward. \u00b6 324 (AAE-031).\n\n459.\n\nThe Tribunal repeated that since a loss of opportunity to have the contract is different from the loss of a fully crystallised legal right to an extension of a contract, \u201cthe expected cash flows of which could be modelled on a DCF basis, such value must necessarily be significantly lower than the amount claimed by Perenco based on the AGIP contract model applied by Mr. Crick's drilling forecasts for Block 7 through to 2018.\u201d399\n\nAward, \u00b6 325 (AAE-031).\n\n460.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal concluded that \u201c[i]n all of the circumstances, the Tribunal holds that an award of US$25 million is appropriate. It cannot but note that the equities tend strongly in favour of the granting of this relief. This however is not a decision *ex aequo et bono*. It is one grounded in law.\u201d400\n\nAward, \u00b6 326 (AAE-031).\n\n461.\n\nIn the view of the Committee the Tribunal reached a decision that does not follow from its analysis and therefore fails to state reasons for its conclusion on loss of opportunity.\n\n462.\n\nThroughout paragraphs 323-326 of the Award, the Tribunal disregarded all possible comparative scenarios proposed by Perenco to support its quantum claim on the loss of opportunity: the *Acta de Acuerdo Parcial*, the economics of Petroamazonas, the Block 10 AGIP Contracts, and acknowledged not only that the Parties might have been unable to reach an agreement, but that Ecuador might have decided not to extend the Block 7 Contract.\n\n463.\n\nThen, it stressed several times that a loss of opportunity is not the same as a contract extension or a loss of profit claim based on a final executed contract and that it is not possible to apply a DCF model to determine a loss of opportunity and therefore the value must necessarily be significantly lower than the amount claimed by Perenco based on the AGIP contract model applied by Mr. Crick's drilling forecasts for Block 7 through to 2018.\n\n464.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal indicated that it cannot engage in the kind of speculation about a specific contractual model and apply Mr. Crick's projections in order to arrive at an amount of damages.\n\n465.\n\nThe quote from Ripinsky and Williams referred to by the Tribunal in the Award indicates that the loss of opportunity can be used as a tool to determine the compensation for the loss of chance to make profit and that, at least in theory, the loss of chance is assessed by reference to the degree of probability of the chance turning out in favour of a claimant, although in practice the amount awarded on this account is often discretionary. In the same quote, the authors add that this type of damages awarded is likely to be conservative and reflect a tribunal's view of an equitable, reasonable and balanced outcome rather than being a result of a mathematical calculation.\n\n466.\n\nHowever, rather than explaining whether it disregarded the degree of probability as a tool and the reasons therefore, or what, in the Tribunal's view, an equitable, reasonable and balanced outcome is, or what could have been the impact of the degree of discretion that Ecuador had not to extend the Participation Contract or, generally, refer to a conclusion from the premises contained in paragraphs 312 to 326, the Tribunal simply \u201cacknowledged\u201d that it has discretion and decided to award \u201ca nominal value.\u201d No explanation whatsoever is given as to what is the concept of a nominal value or the reason to award a nominal value as opposed to any other value.\n\n467.\n\nThere is no doubt that tribunals have discretion in the awarding of damages, however the Committee fails to see, because the Tribunal does not explain, how merely acknowledging that the Tribunal has discretion is the consequence of the analysis proposed by the Tribunal as regards loss of opportunity. The acknowledgement that a tribunal has discretion is merely a general affirmation of one of the powers of a tribunal, but such general affirmation, in the context of the Award, cannot be the sole reason to award a nominal value of damages. The acknowledgement by the Tribunal of its discretion is a stand-alone affirmation that has no clear connection with the preceding paragraphs so that the reasoning of the Tribunal from the premises to the conclusion can be followed.\n\n468.\n\nThe Tribunal seems to be aware of the lack of sufficient reasoning for its conclusion when it considers necessary to stress that the decision on loss of opportunity is not a decision *ex aequo et bono* but rather grounded in law.\n\n469.\n\nBased on the standard referred to in Section III.D.2, the Committee considers that the Tribunal failed to state reasons to conclude that loss of profit should be awarded and the amount therefor.\n\n470.\n\nHowever, the Committee finds no basis, and Ecuador has not even invoked the basis, to annul the entirety of the Award as a result of the absence of reasons in a specific point that can be clearly isolated from the remaining of the Award. The fact that one part of the Tribunal's decision that can be isolated from the remainder of the Award is not reasoned is not enough to annul the whole process of calculation of damages performed by the Tribunal, much less the entirety of the Award. The Committee therefore concludes that the US$25 million awarded as damages for loss of opportunity must be deducted from the US$416.5 million awarded to Perenco, prior to the adjustment factor.\n\n**(3) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that Perenco would have drilled 23 new** **wells on Block 7**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n471.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal held that \u201c23 additional wells would have been drilled during the life of the Block 7 Participation Contract [i.e., even more than the 21 claimed by Perenco],\u201d assuming the contract term would not have been extended. Specifically, the Tribunal held that \u201cthe Consortium would have drilled four wells by January 2008 and 19 wells from February 2008 to August 2009.\u201d Ecuador submits that in so deciding, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure and failed to state the reasons for this decision.401\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 441-442.\n\n472.\n\nAs to the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, prior to deciding *sua sponte* that 23 new wells would have been drilled on Block 7 (i.e., 2 more than what Perenco asserted that it would have drilled), the Tribunal never invited the Parties to comment on a drilling program even more ambitious than that put forward by Perenco. In so doing, the Tribunal also seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, insofar as it infringed Perenco's right to state its claim, and Ecuador's correlative right to state its defense, and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it.402\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 443.\n\n473.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, the Tribunal has not provided any reasons regarding the number of wells that would have been drilled on Block 7 absent Decree 662, nor the period of time across which such drilling by Perenco would have taken place.403\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 444.\n\n474.\n\nAccordingly, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Tribunal's decision to order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco, insofar as the calculation of such amount is based on the volume of oil that Perenco's 23 new Block 7 wells would have produced.404\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 447.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n475.\n\nAccording to Perenco, Ecuador's complaints about the Tribunal's finding that Perenco would have drilled 23 new wells on Block 7 \u2018but for' Ecuador's unlawful conduct are based on a mischaracterization of the Award.405\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 241.\n\n476.\n\nThe Tribunal granted Perenco damages based on 23 \u2018but for' wells that represent two wells Perenco actually drilled right after Ecuador imposed Decree 662 plus 21 new wells that Perenco would have drilled \u2018but for' Decree 662. For the sake of coherence, the Tribunal uniformly labelled these 23 wells as \u2018but for' wells. That was exactly the same number of wells that Perenco requested when it claimed future production from the two actual wells that it drilled right after Decree 662 plus 21 new wells, that is a total of 23 wells after Decree 662.406\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 242-247.\n\n477.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal neither failed to state reasons, nor seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by deciding that Perenco would have drilled 23 new wells on Block 7.407\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 255; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 193.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n478.\n\nEcuador argues that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure and failed to state reasons when deciding that Perenco would have drilled 23 new wells on Block 7.\n\n479.\n\nAs to the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, Ecuador states that the Tribunal breached the Parties' right to be heard by deciding *sua sponte* that Perenco would have drilled 23 new wells on Block 7 in a \u2018but for' scenario (two more wells than the ones claimed by Perenco) and by not allowing the Parties to comment on this thesis. The Committee, however, does not find that the Tribunal breached the Parties' right to be heard.\n\n480.\n\nIn the first place, the Committee observes that both Parties had ample opportunity to present their case as regards the damages caused by Decree 662 and the impact on Perenco's drilling plans on Block 7. In fact, Ecuador does not dispute that the Parties had several procedural opportunities to debate the number of wells that Perenco would have drilled in a \u2018but for' scenario, absent Decree 662. As stressed by Perenco, these opportunities include four rounds of written pleadings on quantum, witness statements, expert reports and oral submissions at the Quantum Hearing and the Closing Arguments Hearing.408 Ecuador's case is thus mainly based on the allegation that the Tribunal departed from the exact pleadings advanced by the Parties and decided *sua sponte* that Perenco would have drilled 23 wells.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 241; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 199.\n\n481.\n\nYet, as repeatedly stated throughout this decision, the Committee is of the view that the Tribunal was not obliged to adopt either of the positions exactly as advanced by each Party. As long as the Tribunal's decision fits the legal framework argued during the arbitration, the Tribunal can make its own assessment of the evidence, legal authorities, documents, pleadings, expert reports and witness statement presented by the Parties. The fact that, based on the evidence in the record, the Tribunal arrived at a number of 23 wells\u2014instead of 21 or 24 wells\u2014does not amount to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Tribunal's conclusion is based on the Parties' submission on whether in a \u2018but for' scenario Perenco would have drilled the Oso fields and/or the Lobo and Coca-Payamino fields, the number of wells it could have drilled, and the time extension of the drilling. The Committee does not see that the Tribunal based its decision on external or novel arguments, documents, or legal authorities not pleaded by the Parties. To the contrary, the Committee observes that the Tribunal paid due consideration to the opinion of the quantum experts, particularly to Mr. Crick's production profiles.409 Thus, Ecuador's argument that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure fails.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 206-255 (AAE-031).\n\n482.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador contends that the Tribunal did not provide \u201creasons for its conclusion regarding the number of wells that would have been drilled on Block 7 absent Decree 662, nor the period of time across which such drilling by Perenco would have taken place.\u201d410 The Committee is not persuaded by Ecuador's argument given that the Tribunal did state the reasons leading to its decision.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 444.\n\n483.\n\nThe Committee finds that five premises referred to by the Tribunal in its Award are critical to the conclusion that in a \u2018but for' scenario Perenco would have drilled 23 new wells: (i) no damages can flow at least until October 4, 2007 when Ecuador committed the unlawful act of enacting Decree 662;411 (ii) it cannot be assumed that the \u201cthe extension of Block 7 would have been based on the AGIP contract or some other proxy\u201d, thus drilling plans for Block 7 for the period after the date of the Block 7 Contract's expiry on 16 August 2010 cannot be taken into consideration;\u201d412 (iii) \u201cin absence of a contract extension, Perenco would have stopped drilling in Block 7 in August 2009 in order to ensure an adequate payback on the new wells;\u201d413 (iv) Perenco would have concentrated in the less challenging Oso field than in the riskier and more expensive waterflooding Lobo and Coca-Payamino fields;414 and (v) \u201cthe sharply rising price of oil leading up to October 2007 would have induced Perenco to seek to drill as many wells as were economically possible in the Oso field in the time remaining in that Contract.\u201d415\n\nAward, \u00b6 127 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 223 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 252 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 253-254 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 252 (AAE-031).\n\n484.\n\nFrom the said premises it follows that, contrary to Ecuador's assertion, the Tribunal did identify the period in which the drilling would have taken place in a \u2018but for' scenario: between October 2007 and August 2009. As regards the number of wells, the Committee observes that although the Tribunal does not expressly mention how it arrives to the number of 23 wells, it can be inferred that the Tribunal derived its conclusion from Perenco's assertion that:\n\nBut for Decree 662, Perenco argued, it would have continued to drill one well per month in Oso, just as it was doing at the time that Decree 662 came into effect and it would have continued this drilling programme for as long as it remained profitable to do so. Perenco asserted that this ought not to be controversial: further Oso wells would undeniably produce new reserves and Perenco indisputably had previously achieved a one-well-per-month drilling schedule in Oso.416\n\nAward, \u00b6 229 (AAE-031).\n\n485.\n\nThe number of 23 new wells is correlated to the number of months in which the drilling would have taken place: one-well-per-month.\n\n486.\n\nThis conclusion finds further support on the fact that the Tribunal expressly indicated that \u201cthe Consortium would have drilled four wells by January 2008 and 19 wells from February 2008 to August 2009.\u201d\n\n487.\n\nThus, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not fail to state the reasons for its decision that absent Decree 662, Perenco would have drilled 23 new wells.\n\n488.\n\nIn sum, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal neither seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure nor failed to state the reasons for its decision.\n\n**(4) Grounds on the Tribunal's decision to award Perenco damages amounting to US$448,820,400**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n489.\n\nEcuador states that to reach the amount of US$448,820,400 of damages awarded to Perenco, the Tribunal relied on an adjusted discounted cash flow model (the \u201c**Model**\u201d) which it neither disclosed nor explained, although the Parties had agreed on such disclosure. Thus, neither Party is in a position to know how the various components of its calculations led to the final amount of compensation indicated in the Award. In awarding said damages to Perenco, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its decision and also manifestly exceeded its powers.417\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 449.\n\n490.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador refers to the agreement reached by the Parties and the Tribunal that the quantum experts be made the Tribunal's experts. Ecuador notes that it accepted the Tribunal's proposal on the understanding that \u201cin its award, the Tribunal may use the figures provided by the economic experts, but will not mention this agreement nor the process resulting therefrom.\u201d418 Perenco, in turn, acceded to the proposal, including Ecuador's condition, but sought to add other conditions.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 451.\n\n491.\n\nThe Tribunal decided to follow the Parties' agreement without expressing any further concerns. One year later, on May 30, 2017, the Tribunal confirmed to the Parties that it would disclose the joint calculations provided by the quantum experts in the Model, simultaneously with the dispatch of the Award.419 In the Award, however, the issues related to the quantification of Perenco's damages are dealt with in less than 13 pages, and the Model is neither enclosed nor explained.420\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 455.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 457.\n\n492.\n\nOn October 2, 2019, five days after the Award was rendered, Ecuador requested that the Tribunal disclose to the Parties the \u201charmonised model\u201d on which it relied to calculate Perenco's compensation. However, on October 9, ICSID informed Ecuador that the Tribunal was *functus officio* and therefore the Parties would not receive the Model*.*421 Accordingly, it was impossible for Ecuador to discern how and why the Tribunal had reached its decision on this point.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 458.\n\n493.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal did not provide any reasons for the adjustments made to the Parties' calculations. The Tribunal failed to include a description of the precise inputs of the Model and the adjustments the Tribunal applied to the Parties' models to come up with its own Model. Whilst the Tribunal indicated some numerical values in certain paragraphs of the Award, these values are insufficient for Ecuador to follow the reasoning through which the Tribunal derived said values. In contrast, in the counterclaims stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal conveyed to the Parties the report issued by the environmental expert appointed by it, and the Parties had the opportunity to question the expert at the hearing convened at The Hague.422\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 463-465.\n\n494.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal failed to state its reasons when it decided that a \u201cfair amount\u201d for the \u2018true-up' should be US$36.4 million, as it did not provide any reasoning regarding the third component of the \u2018true-up', i.e., \u201cthe confluence of events and the Parties' various actions surrounding the *coactivas*;\u201d it did not indicate the values of the first three components of the \u2018true-up' nor the process through which it allegedly determined such values; and given that it did not indicate the numerical values of the first three components, it is impossible for Ecuador to determine how the Tribunal concluded that their balance was of US$-5.9 million.423\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 467-479.\n\n495.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, in the Award, the Tribunal concluded \u201cthat a fair amount for the \u2018true-up' should be US$36.4 million.\u201d Instead of ascribing value to each component of the \u2018true-up', the Tribunal came up with what it subjectively deemed to be a \u201cfair\u201d amount. In so doing, the Tribunal acted as an *amiable compositeur*, exercising a power which the Parties had not vested in it and thus manifestly exceeded its powers.424\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 480.\n\n496.\n\nFor the above reasons, Ecuador requests that the Committee annul the Tribunal's decision to order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco, insofar as (i) the Tribunal's determination on compensation is also based on the Tribunal's decisions that the Parties would have agreed to stabilize Law 42 at 33% and that Perenco is entitled to US$25 million for the lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 Participation Contract,425 and (ii) the calculation of such amount is based on the application of a \u2018true-up' of US$36.4 million.426\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 466.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 481.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n497.\n\nPerenco states that although Ecuador challenges the Tribunal's damages assessment claiming that it is a \u201cblack box\u201d because the Tribunal allegedly did not \u201cdisclose\u201d or \u201cexplain\u201d the adjusted discounted cash flow model on which it relied, the Award is fully reasoned and explains the adjusted calculations that the Tribunal relied on, as agreed by the Parties. Therefore, the fact that the \u201cModel\u201d was not rendered with the Award is neither a failure to state reasons nor a manifest excess of powers.427\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 256.\n\n498.\n\nPerenco argues that \u201cthe Tribunal explained \u2018the methodology that was used to estimate the damages to be awarded for each individual claim in light of the factual and legal findings' and the \u2018harmonised model' [that] could be produced through the adjustments of the models [provided by the Parties' economic experts] to implement the Tribunal's findings.\u201d428 The Tribunal then described in detail each of the steps taken in relation to the harmonised model, including production forecasts, its reasoning on oil prices, CAPEX costs for the Block 7 wells, and the 1.0776 adjustment factor to account for pre-award interest rates.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 259.\n\n499.\n\nPerenco stresses that the Tribunal worked confidentially with both Parties' quantum experts as joint tribunal experts. Yet, for political reasons, Ecuador insisted that in the Award, \u201cthe Tribunal may use the figures provided by the economic experts but will not mention this agreement nor the process resulting therefrom\u201d and that \u201cEcuador cannot agree with the Tribunal stating in the award that it followed a process agreed by the parties to determine the amount of compensation.\u201d Ironically, Ecuador is now alleging that the Tribunal was not sufficiently transparent, and the Award must be annulled. Such position, however, cannot succeed. More than 100 pages in the Award contain reasons for the Tribunal's damages assessments. Furthermore, both Ecuador's agreement with Perenco and the Tribunal about the post-hearing process and fundamental fairness prevent Ecuador from now trying to take advantage of its politically motivated efforts to hamper the Tribunal's ability to freely write the Award.429\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 265.\n\n500.\n\nAlthough Ecuador contends that the \u201cParties allegedly agreed that the quantum experts' discounted cash flow model \u2018would be communicated to the Parties together with the Award' and that the Tribunal \u2018failed to disclose the Model,' it does not support its claim with the actual record in the arbitration. Perenco notes that in the May 2017 letter, the Tribunal stated to the Parties that \u2018[i]f the Parties so wish, the Tribunal [\u2026] will disclose to the Parties [\u2026] the joint calculations provided by the economic experts,' subject to the \u2018redaction of any and all instructions from the Tribunal to the experts which describe or otherwise disclose the Tribunal's consideration of the Parties' submissions and its internal thinking.'\u201d430 Nonetheless, none of the Parties responded to the Tribunal that they \u201cwished\u201d to receive the experts' joint calculations subject to the redactions described by the Tribunal. Accordingly, the Tribunal did not disclose the Model, as it was not obliged to do it in accordance with the Parties' agreement.431 In any event, if Ecuador considered that the Tribunal committed an annullable error in not disclosing any calculations or model, it could have petitioned the Tribunal to rectify or supplement its Award pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. It did not.432\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 204.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 266; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 204.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 270.\n\n501.\n\nAccording to Perenco, Ecuador wrongly claims that the Tribunal failed to state reasons and manifestly exceeded its powers when it deducted US$36.4 million from Perenco's compensation to account for amounts owed by Perenco to Ecuador, i.e., the \u2018true-up'. The Tribunal explained its reasoning on the true-up, including the *coactivas* issue and the values of the other three components. In the same line, the Tribunal did not act as an *amiable compositeur* merely because it used the word \u201cfair\u201d, its findings regarding the true-up were based on the Parties' fact and expert evidence.433\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 271-274; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 213-216.\n\n502.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal neither failed to state reasons nor manifestly exceeded its powers in finding that Perenco is entitled to US$448.8 million in damages.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nThe Committee notes that Ecuador's claims are focused on two main points: (i) the Tribunal's alleged failure to disclose the Model with the Award and its alleged failure to state the reasons for its decision to award damages to Perenco amounting to US$448,820,400; and (ii) the Tribunal's alleged failure to state reasons and manifest excess of powers when deciding that the \u201ctrue-up\u201d amounted to US$36.4 million.\n\n504.\n\nThe Committee will address the first issue. For the purpose of illustrating the scope of the agreement between the Tribunal and the Parties on the joint expert calculations, and the Tribunal's alleged obligation to disclose the Model with the Award, the Committee will recount the facts related to the Parties' agreement, as submitted and alleged by the Parties in this annulment proceeding.\n\n505.\n\nAt the Hearing on Quantum, the Tribunal proposed to the Parties that the quantum experts be made the Tribunal's experts. On April 26, 2016, the Tribunal communicated the following message to the Parties:\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the parties are still discussing the Tribunal's proposal that the quantum experts be made the Tribunal's experts. The Tribunal understands that this matter is still under discussion and that the Tribunal will be informed shortly.\n\nThe Tribunal strongly recommends to the parties that they adopt the Tribunal's proposal. If they do not, the Tribunal will be obliged to appoint another financial expert to assist it in arriving to at the appropriate figure for quantum. This will lead to additional costs and delay and in any event such expert will need access to the computer programs, schedules, etcetera that have been used by the parties' experts to date.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore looks forward to hearing from the Parties at their earliest convenience that the Tribunal's proposal is acceptable.434\n\nTribunal Email to the Parties, April 26, 2016 (CEA-043).\n\n506.\n\nOn May 3, 2016, Ecuador confirmed its agreement with the Tribunal's proposal as follows:\n\n[\u2026] Ecuador agrees to proceed as per the Tribunal's proposal with the understanding that, in its award, the Tribunal may use the figures provided by the economic experts, but will not mention this agreement nor the process resulting therefrom [\u2026].435\n\nEcuador Email to the Tribunal, May 3, 2016, p. 1 (CEA-044).\n\n507.\n\nOn May 6, 2016, Perenco presented its comments on Ecuador's proposal:\n\nPerenco writes at the Tribunal's 3 May 2016 invitation to comment on Ecuador's proposal that the Tribunal's award \u201cnot mention\u201d the Tribunal's proposed process to determine the damages due to Perenco or the parties' agreement to that process. As Perenco has previously stated, it accepts the Tribunal's proposal to have the parties' respective valuation experts conduct joint analyses at the Tribunal's direction, to do so confidentially without conferring with the parties, at the parties' expense. Ecuador now appears also to accept that proposal, but provided that the Tribunal not disclose that it used such a process.\n\nWhile Perenco wishes to be flexible and constructive, it has serious reservations about Ecuador's condition. Ecuador's condition is objectionable in principle, in that it seeks to constrain the Tribunal in how it explains its award. Moreover, it is potentially dangerous. The parties mutually expect the Tribunal to provide reasons for its decision. If the Tribunal simply presents certain figures with no explanation as to how it arrived at them, it could leave a potentially serious gap in the reasoning. This gap might undermine the purpose of providing reasons, and might provide an argument for annulment of the Tribunal's award.\n\nPerenco would therefore strongly prefer transparency about the process the Tribunal will use to determine the particular amount due to Perenco. To be transparent, the Tribunal should describe the process that it used, as well as the calculations the experts have jointly made.\n\nDespite these reservations, Perenco wishes to be as accommodating and pragmatic as possible without prejudicing its rights. Accordingly, Perenco would be prepared to accept Ecuador's condition, provided that (1) it is acceptable to the Tribunal; (2) in the award the Tribunal states that it has followed a process agreed by the parties to determine the amount of compensation owed to Perenco (without describing that process in detail); (3) the Tribunal discloses to the parties, and is free to describe in the award, the joint calculations (although without disclosing in the award that they reflect the joint work of the experts); and (4) that Ecuador provides an iron clad representation and undertaking that it will in no way use the absence of additional detail about the Tribunal's assessment of the compensation amount as any kind of basis for seeking annulment.\n\nShould the Tribunal reject Ecuador's condition, then Perenco continues to believe that the most fair and efficient process would for the Tribunal simply to issue an interim decision and direct the parties' experts to provide, jointly or singly, analyses of the ensuing valuation consequences within a short and defined time frame.436\n\nEcuador Email to the Tribunal, May 13, 2016, pp. 2-3 (CEA-045).\n\n508.\n\nOn May 13, 2016, Ecuador sent the following message to the Tribunal:\n\nTo avoid protracted discussions and since Ecuador has already stated its position in its communication of 3 May 2016, Ecuador will only address the four conditions Perenco seeks to impose on Ecuador and the Tribunal in its email of 6 May 2016.\n\nEcuador has no objection to conditions 1 and 3 as they mirror Ecuador's position.\n\nHowever, Ecuador cannot agree to conditions 2 and 4. In particular:\n\nOn condition 2, Ecuador cannot agree with the Tribunal stating in the award that it followed a process agreed by the parties to determine the amount of compensation; and\n\nCondition 4 proceeds on a false premise. Indeed, the process proposed by Ecuador in no way limits the Tribunal's ability to give reasons for its decision in the award, as tribunals most often do when deciding quantum issues. Ecuador's proposal allows the Tribunal to explain how it arrived at a certain amount, if any. While Ecuador is willing to make its experts available to the Tribunal\u2014to limit the time and costs involved in the Tribunal appointing its own expert\u2014it cannot accept that any agreement or agreed process be referred to in the award. Should Perenco maintain its position, Ecuador understands that the Tribunal will appoint its own expert to assist it in the decision of the quantum phase of these proceedings.437\n\nEcuador Email to the Tribunal, May 13, 2016, p. 1 (CEA-045).\n\n509.\n\nOn May 31 and June 1, 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached an agreement (the \u201c**Parties' Agreement**\u201d), and communicated the agreed conditions as follows:\n\nFirst, the Award will not mention the joint expert process nor the parties' agreement to that process.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal will disclose to the parties, and is free to describe and use in the Award, the joint calculations provided by the economic experts (although without disclosing in the Award that they reflect the joint work of the experts).\n\nThird, Ecuador specifically acknowledges, for the avoidance of doubt, that Perenco may submit to an annulment committee, should one be constituted, the parties' exchanges showing Ecuador's consent to the process regarding the quantum experts.\n\nFourth, the parties' experts should respect the relevant confidentiality rules in their invoices to the parties, and each expert should send its invoices to the party that had initially hired the expert, copying the Tribunal secretary and counsel for the other party.\n\nAdditionally, this agreement by the parties is of course subject to the approval of the Tribunal, for it is the Tribunal that ultimately must write the Award and provide its reasons. Nothing in this agreement is intended to interfere with the Tribunal's ability to do so. The parties would be happy to answer any questions the Tribunal may have about the foregoing agreement. If the Tribunal finds it acceptable, we would be grateful for confirmation that the Tribunal will proceed along the lines that the parties have proposed.438\n\nCorrespondence between the Parties and the Tribunal, May 31, 2016 (AAE-171).\n\n510.\n\nOn June 10, 2016, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties taking note of the Parties' Agreement and informing them that \u201cit has decided to follow the [\u2026] agreement.\u201d439\n\nTribunal Letter to the Parties, June 10, 2016, p. 2 (CEA-046).\n\n511.\n\nOn May 30, 2017, the Tribunal sent a letter to the Parties communicating \u201cits decisions on various pending requests of the Parties,\u201d including that:\n\nThe Tribunal will not seek the comments of the Parties on the joint calculations performed for it by the quantum experts. If the Parties so wish, the Tribunal, in accordance with the Parties' agreement as reflected in the Tribunal's letter of 10 June 2016, \u201cwill disclose to the Parties [\u2026] the joint calculations provided by the economic experts.\u201d This will be done simultaneously with the dispatch of the Award in which the Tribunal, in accordance with the above-mentioned agreement of the Parties, cannot \u201cdisclos[e] [\u2026] that [the calculations] reflect the joint work of the experts.\u201d Since the Tribunal cannot make such a disclosure in the publicly available version of its Award, subject to the redaction of any and all instructions from the Tribunal to the experts which describe or otherwise disclose the Tribunal's consideration of the Parties' submissions and its internal thinking, the Tribunal sees no impediment to the experts' joint calculations being disclosed with the Award after the deliberations are concluded. The Tribunal directs the Parties' attention in this regard to Rule 15(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which provides that: \u2018The deliberations of the Tribunal shall take place in private and remain secret.'440\n\nTribunal Letter to the Parties, May 30, 2017, pp. 3-4 (CEA-048).\n\n512.\n\nNone of the Parties manifested that it wished that the Tribunal disclose the joint expert calculations provided by the economic experts with the dispatch of the Award.\n\n513.\n\nOn September 27, 2019, the Tribunal issued the Award. It did not enclose with the Award the \u201cModel\u201d with the joint calculations performed by the quantum experts.\n\n514.\n\nOn October 2, 2019, Ecuador requested that the Tribunal disclose to the Parties the \u201charmonised model\u201d on which it had relied to calculate Perenco's compensation.441\n\nEcuador's letter to the Tribunal, October 2, 2019 (AAE-174).\n\n515.\n\nOn October 9, 2019, ICSID sent a letter to Ecuador with the following message:\n\n[\u2026] [W]e remind the parties that the above case concluded on September 27, 2019, when the Acting Secretary-General dispatched certified copies of the Tribunal's Award in accordance with Article 49(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nWe also note that on October 4, 2019, the Acting Secretary-General registered Ecuador's Application for Annulment dated October 2, 2019, in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 50.442\n\nLetter from ICSID to the Parties, dated October 9, 2019 (AAE-175).\n\n516.\n\nIn the light of the above mentioned documents, the Committee finds: (1) that it was the Applicant who required the special agreement on the joint expert report and that the Parties' Agreement was freely and jointly entered into by the Parties; (2) that the Tribunal accepted to follow the Parties' Agreement; (3) that the Tribunal could not mention in the Award the joint expert process nor the Parties' Agreement; (4) that the Parties' Agreement provides that the \u201cTribunal will disclose to the parties, and is free to describe and use in the Award, the joint calculations provided by the economic experts,\u201d not that the Tribunal must disclose the spreadsheet with the experts' joint calculations (5) that the Tribunal could not disclose in the Award that the calculations reflected the joint work of the quantum experts; (6) that the Parties' Agreement is not intended to interfere in the Tribunal's ability to provide reasons for its decisions in the Award; and (7) that despite being asked by the Tribunal, the Parties did not indicate that they wished that the Tribunal disclose the joint expert calculations with the dispatch of the Award.\n\n517.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee concludes that although the Tribunal was not obliged to enclose to the Award a spreadsheet with the joint experts' calculation\u2014such as the \u201cModel\u201d\u2014, the Tribunal was obliged to state the reasons for its decision. As noted in Section III.D.2, the Parties to an ICSID arbitration cannot validly waive the obligation of the Tribunal to \u201cstate reasons\u201d. Therefore, the Parties' Agreement cannot be understood in the sense that it relieves the Tribunal's duty to state the reasons for its decision. In fact, the Parties' Agreement expressly states that \u201c[n]othing in this agreement is intended to interfere with the Tribunal's ability to [state its reasons].\u201d443\n\nCorrespondence between the Parties and the Tribunal, May 31, 2016 (AAE-171).\n\n518.\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the Committee is of the view that the Parties' Agreement made the Tribunal's duty to state reasons more complex given that it could not refer to such agreement or the joint expert process, and it could not disclose that the calculations reflected the joint work of the experts in the Award. What is more, the Parties did not manifest that they wished that the Tribunal disclose the joint experts' calculations provided by the economic experts with the dispatch of the Award. These circumstances made the Tribunal's task a challenging one.\n\n519.\n\nThe Committee stresses that ICSID arbitral tribunals have a margin of discretion to determine the amount of the damages awarded to a party.444 Furthermore, the duty to state reasons does not oblige arbitral tribunals to disclose each mathematical calculation supporting its estimation of the damages. Thus, the Committee considers that the Tribunal did not breach its duty to state reasons merely because it did not enclose the \u201cModel\u201d to the Award. In the Committee's view, what is paramount is that the Tribunal's conclusions are supported by a set of implicit or explicit premises.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 362-367 of the present Decision.\n\n520.\n\nIn view of the aforesaid, the Committee will now turn to examine whether the Tribunal provided reasons for its decision to award damages to Perenco amounting to US$448,820,400.\n\n521.\n\nThe Committee observes that the Tribunal developed its analysis on damages in approximately 268 pages. The Tribunal began its analysis by referring to the Parties' positions in the damages phase.445 Then, it identified the four main issues that separated the Parties: (i) restitution, i.e., whether Perenco's damages should be calculated at the date of the Award or at the date of the breach; (ii) production, i.e., whether the calculation of the number of wells that Perenco would have drilled and the volumes of oil should be based on Mr. Crick's or RPS's forecast; (iii) absorption, i.e., whether Perenco's right to absorption of all Law 42 should be valued or not; (iv) extension, i.e., whether Perenco should be accorded value for the extension of the Block 7 Contract that would have been agreed absent Ecuador's breaches.446\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 55-65 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 68 (AAE-031).\n\n522.\n\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to explain how it \u201cintends to deal with the principal issues identified by the Parties,\u201d and indicated that certain issues are addressed at the outset, including: (i) the dates of valuation of damages, (ii) the Tribunal's decision to employ two valuation dates; and (iii) the use of contemporaneous evidence in the valuation.\n\n523.\n\nAs to the valuation date, after referring to Article 36(1) of the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, and analyzing and contrasting the Parties' positions and the experts' opinions, the Tribunal concluded that \u201cDecree 662 and *caducidad* [\u2026] cannot be lumped together so as to land on a single date that is then used to value the breaches' collective impact.\u201d447 Thus, the Tribunal \u201cdecided that it is appropriate to seek to value the damages caused by different breaches occurring at different times.\u201d448 The Tribunal further analyzed whether the FET breaches that took place after Decree 662 and before the *caducidad* declaration \u201chave been shown to result in a recognisable harm.\u201d449 In this regard, the Tribunal concluded that \u201cthe financial impact of the non-Decree 662 breaches has either been accounted for in the \u2018but for' analysis of Decree 662 as of 4 October 2007 or was not quantified by the expert reports submitted with the Claimant's pleadings on quantum.\u201d450\n\nAward, \u00b6 77 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 100 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 102 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 107 (AAE-031).\n\n524.\n\nAs to the Tribunal's decision to employ two valuation dates, the Tribunal explained why it decided to account for an initial valuation of the damages caused by Decree 662 and then a second valuation (a \u201cclean sheet\u201d) of the damage caused by the *caducidad* declaration.451 The Tribunal further explained that, \u201c[t]he result is an initial award of damages for Decree 662's impact during the roughly 33-month period between the first completed breach and the last breach. Then, because of the effect of the expropriation, a new valuation is performed, based on pricing and market information available as of the date of the expropriation. The initial award of damages attributable to Decree 662 is capped at that point; this then requires the Tribunal to make certain determinations as to the nature of the contractual rights that were terminated. These are included in the calculation and the value of the one-month interest in Block 7 as well as the approximately 10-year period left on Block 21 will be estimated.\u201d452 The Tribunal also decided to calculate the *caducidad* damages primarily under an *ex ante* approach and explained the reasons for doing so.453\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 108-117 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 114 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 115-117 (AAE-031).\n\n525.\n\nAs to the use of contemporary evidence of value, the Tribunal referred to the availability of Perenco's net present value (NPV) of the impact of Law 42 at 50% and 99% on both Blocks, which were performed immediately after Decree 662's announcement.454 For the Tribunal, \u201cthese documents of the Claimant's own making are, in the Tribunal's view, good evidence of the Blocks' estimated value with Law 42 at 50% and 99% in light of the existing and expected market circumstances at the time of the first breach,\u201d455 and therefore \u201cit is a good way to check the results that the Tribunal arrives at.\u201d456\n\nAward, \u00b6 118 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 119 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 124 (AAE-031).\n\n526.\n\nThereafter, before estimating the quantum of damages awarded to Perenco under the \u201charmonised model\u201d,457 the Tribunal proceeded to address the following issues: (i) the financial impact of Decree 662 on Perenco's interests in the Blocks as of October 4, 2007;458 (iii) the impact of Decree 662 on Perenco's drilling plans for Blocks 7 and 21;459 (iii) the impact of *caducidad* declaration of the balance of Perenco's contractual rights in Blocks 7 and 21;460 (iii) whether, in the \u2018but for' world, Perenco would have enjoyed an extension of its operatorship in Block 7 after August 2010 (Perenco's loss of opportunity to operate Block 7),461 (iv) Perenco's alleged contributory negligence;462 and (v) the \u2018true-up' issue.463\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 125-127 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 127-149 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 150-304 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 305-311 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 312-326 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 327-363 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 364-380 (AAE-031).\n\n527.\n\nThe Tribunal then continued to estimate the financial consequences on Blocks 7 and 21 of Ecuador's breaches. The Tribunal explained that as methodology used to award damages for each individual claim a \u201c'harmonised model' was devised through which the Tribunal has calculated the damages to be awarded.\u201d464 The Tribunal further noted that the \u201charmonised model\u201d could be produced through the adjustments of Professor Kalt's and Brattle's models to implement the Tribunal's findings described above.465 The Tribunal proceeded to describe the changes implemented to the models of the quantum experts and also described the \u201charmonised model.\u201d\n\nAward, \u00b6 382 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 383 (AAE-031).\n\n528.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal noted that \u201c[t]he \u2018harmonised model' assumes away the effect of Decree 662 and *caducidad* in order to arrive at the net present value of the discounted cash flows that would have been derived from Blocks 7 and 21.\u201d466\n\nAward, \u00b6 384 (AAE-031).\n\n529.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal, such calculations were based on the following premises incorporated in the \u2018harmonised model':\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe production decisions that the Tribunal has found Perenco would have made but for the unlawful measures.\u201d467\n\n\u2022 The Model was employed to make \u201can initial valuation of the damage caused by Decree 662 and then a second valuation of the damage caused by the declaration of *caducidad*.\u201d468\n\n\u2022 \u201c[I]n the \u2018but for' world, Law 42 at 50% would have continued to apply from October 2007 until 5 October 2008 at which point, by party agreement, the rate would have been 33%, which rate would have applied from that date through to the respective expiry dates of the two Participation Contracts.\u201d469\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal forecasts the production in both Blocks in the \u2018but for' world for the first period and for Block 21 for the second period on an *ex ante* basis.470\n\n\u2022 \u201cAfter estimating the production levels, the production is then priced on the basis of *ex ante* expectations at the relevant times.\u201d471\n\n\u2022 The estimation of the amount of CAPEX and OPEX, and other costs, associated with the assumed levels of production.472\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe cash flows are then discounted to the relevant date of valuation, and then brought forward to the date of the Award at pre-award interest rates.\u201d473\n\n\u2022 \u201cFinally, the true-up is applied to reflect the acts discussed previously that affect the quantum calculation.\u201d474\n\nAward, \u00b6 384 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 384 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 385 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 386 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 386 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 386 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 386 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 387 (AAE-031).\n\n530.\n\nThereafter, between paragraphs 389 and 419, the Tribunal explains \u201ceach of these steps taken in relation to the \u2018harmonised model.'\u201d475\n\nAward, \u00b6 388 (AAE-031).\n\n531.\n\nThe Committee observes that besides the aforesaid \u201csteps\u201d, in paragraphs 420 and 421 of the Award, the Tribunal accounted for the \u201cOCP deductibility\u201d and the \u201cvalue of loss of opportunity.\u201d Finally, at paragraph 422 the Tribunal concluded that:\n\nThe sum of US$416.5 million arrived at above is then brought forward to the date of this Award by means of multiplying that sum by an adjustment factor of 1.0776 to arrive at a final figure of US$448,820,400.00. This sum is the damages that are awarded to Perenco and shall be paid by the Respondent, the Republic of Ecuador.\n\n532.\n\nAfter having analyzed the Tribunal's reasoning, the Committee concludes that contrary to Ecuador's contention, the Tribunal did state the reasons for the adjustments made to the quantum experts' models to arrive to a \u201charmonised model,\u201d and it did state the premises leading to its decision to award US$448,820,400 to Perenco. Notwithstanding the previous finding, the Committee will address four specific elements of the Tribunal's reasoning that Ecuador particularly emphasizes:\n\n533.\n\nFirst, the oil production. For Ecuador, the Tribunal \u201cslightly adjusted Perenco's forecasts, but failed to identify either the specific adjustments or the manner in which they were implemented in such forecasts.\u201d476 According to Ecuador \u201cwithout the Model, it is impossible to understand how the Tribunal altered Perenco's production profiles to arrive at the total oil production figures stated in paragraphs 394 and 397 of the Award.\u201d477\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 384.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 384.\n\n534.\n\nThe Committee observes that Ecuador acknowledges that in the Award, the Tribunal \u201c(i) indicated the number of new wells that would have been drilled on the Blocks absent Decree 662, (iii) provided the aggregate production figures for the \u2018*base*' and \u2018*incremental*' productions, and (iii) disclosed the risk adjustment factors it had applied.\u201d478 The fact that Ecuador considers that the Tribunal's reasoning is incomplete or insufficient does not amount to a failure to state reasons. Furthermore, the duty to state reasons does not require that the Tribunal explain every single argument or mathematical calculation supporting its estimation of damages.479 Therefore Ecuador's argument fails.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 384.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 362-367 of the present Decision.\n\n535.\n\nSecond, the oil prices. Ecuador claims that the \u201cAward does not contain a single line of reasoning as to how the Tribunal calculated \u2018the *ex ante* prices for oil production from each Block and over different time periods.'\u201d480 Ecuador further alleges that \u201c[a]bsent the Model, Ecuador cannot know what such prices actually were. Nor did the Tribunal indicate the \u2018periods of time' over which it calculated such prices.\u201d481\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 387.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 388.\n\n536.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Tribunal did provide reasons regarding its assessment of the oil prices. This is evidenced between paragraphs 398 and 401 of the Award, where the Tribunal explained that the oil quality of each Block differed and therefore the *ex ante* prices for oil production from each Block and over different time periods had to be calculated. The Tribunal further explained (i) that WTI prices (NYMEX future prices) were used at the two key dates of valuation: October 2007 and July 2010, (ii) that these prices were adjusted to reflect the differences in the quality of the oil referenced in WTI crude oil and that produced in Ecuador, (iii) that these prices were adjusted to reflect the specific quality of the oil produced in Blocks 7 and 21, and (iv) that the field-specific adjustment factors were applied to the benchmark oil prices in Ecuador to generate field-specific prices. Albeit Ecuador might consider these reasons insufficient, that is not tantamount to a failure to state reasons. Thus, Ecuador's argument fails.\n\n537.\n\nThird, the CAPEX. Ecuador contends that it is not sufficient that the Tribunal state that it relied on Professor Kalt's calculations, adjusted to reflect the schedule pursuant to which the new wells would have been drilled. For the Applicant, \u201cthe particulars of such adjustment are nowhere to be found in the Award.\u201d482\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 390.\n\n538.\n\nThe Committee observes that Ecuador's contention is based on the allegation that the Tribunal's reasons are insufficient. As previously explained, the fact that a Party considers the reasoning insufficient does not amount to a failure to state reasons. In any event, the Committee finds that the Tribunal provided reasons for its conclusions regarding the CAPEX in Blocks 7 and 21.\n\n539.\n\nAs to Block 7, the Tribunal explained that (i) the Oso capital expenditure is based on Mr. Crick's evidence which was utilised by Professor Kalt in his financial model, (ii) all assumed capital expenditures reflect the same essential build-up of individual per-well and facilities costs reflected in Professor Kalt's first Quantum calculations, (iii) said calculations were adjusted to reflect the Tribunal's conclusions that 4 wells would have been drilled by January 2008 and 19 wells drilled between February 2008 to August 2009, and (iv) that the starting point for calculations should be on an *ex ante* basis.\n\n540.\n\nAs to Block 21, the Tribunal explained that (i) CAPEX was estimated following cost information contained in Mr. Crick's Yuralpa development plan, and (ii) said CAPEX was adjusted to reflect the Tribunal's findings on the 16-well programme and the water483 sensitivities.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 403-405 (AAE-031).\n\n541.\n\nTherefore, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons for its conclusion regarding CAPEX.\n\n542.\n\nFourth, the adjustment factor of 1.0776. Ecuador states that \u201cnowhere in the Award is there any statement to the effect that the 1.0776 adjustment factor accounts for pre-award interest.\u201d484 The Committee, however, finds that at paragraph 386 of the Award, after explaining the steps for estimating damages, the Tribunal concluded that \u201c[t]he cash flows are then discounted to the relevant date of valuation, and then brought forward to the date of the Award at pre-interest rates.\u201d Then, at paragraph 410 of the Award, the Tribunal explained the process for determining the applicable pre-award interests. Although it is true that in paragraph 422 the Tribunal did not explicitly state that the 1.0776 adjustment factor accounts for pre-award interest, such premise is implicit and can be found at paragraphs 386 and 410 of the Award.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 393.\n\n543.\n\nIn sum, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons by not disclosing the Model and that it did provide reasons for its decision to award Perenco damages amounting to US$448,820,400.\n\n544.\n\nThe Committee will now turn to Ecuador's contention that the Tribunal failed to state reasons and manifestly exceeded its powers when deciding that the \u201ctrue-up\u201d amounted to US$36.4 million.\n\n545.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador argues (i) that the Tribunal failed to provide as much as a single line of reasoning regarding the third component of the \u2018true-up'; (ii) that the Tribunal failed to indicate the values of any of the first three components of the \u2018true-up', nor did it explain the process through which it allegedly determined such values;485 and (iii) that the reasoning provided by the Tribunal in the Award is insufficient to replicate the calculations that led the Tribunal to the total value of the \u2018true-up'.486\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 474.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 475.\n\n546.\n\nThe Committee observes that between paragraphs 364 and 380 of the Award, the Tribunal addressed Ecuador's \u2018true-up' case. After presenting the Parties' positions,487 the Tribunal explained its views on the \u2018true-up': (i) to the extent that a \u2018true-up' is appropriate with respect to unpaid Law 42 levies, after the Consortium suspended payment in April 2008, the true-up must adhere to the *ex ante* assumptions of future oil prices; (ii) the applicable level of taxation is that of Law 42 at 50% up to October 2008 and an assumed agreement at 33% thereafter; (iii) the \u2018true-up', as originally calculated by Brattle, was adjusted to take out Brattle's initial use of *ex post* pricing data; (iv) when calculating the \u2018true-up', the Tribunal took into consideration that the Consortium paid Law 42 dues at 99% from October 4, 2007 until April 30, 2008 in the off-shore bank account, but it did not actually remit the Law 42 fees to Ecuador; (v) the \u2018true-up' was adjusted to reflect the Tribunal's findings that Law 42 at 50% was lawful, that Law 42 at 99% was unlawful, and that as of October 2008 the Parties would have agreed to stabilization of Law 42 at 33%; (vi) the \u2018true-up' was adjusted to address Perenco's share of termination costs related to the implementation of Decree 662; (vii) the \u2018true-up' was adjusted to address Ecuador's claimed expenses during the time of Perenco's operatorship; and (viii) the \u2018true-up' was adjusted to address the *coactivas* issue in line with the Tribunal's finding that Law 42 at 50% was lawful, while Law 42 at 99% was unlawful.488\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 364-371 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 372-380 (AAE-031).\n\n547.\n\nThereafter, in paragraphs 412-419 of the Award, the Tribunal describes the steps it took to determine the amount of the true-up, expressly referring to certain calculations provided by the quantum experts.\n\n548.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal did not provide the mathematical model supporting its reasoning and calculations, as explained in Section III.D.2 above, it is enough that the Tribunal explains the premises leading to its conclusion and that the conclusion follows from the premises. The Committee observes that the Tribunal did explain the elements that it took into consideration when calculating the damages.489 Therefore, the Committee concludes that Ecuador's claim under Article 52(1)(e) fails.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 414-418 (AAE-031).\n\n549.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador seems to take issue with the fact that the Tribunal refers to a \u201cfair amount\u201d when concluding that the \u2018true-up' should be US$36.4 million. However, as explained in the previous paragraphs, the Tribunal explained that it based its calculations on the Parties' positions and on the opinions of the quantum experts, and applied the pertinent adjustments to reflect its findings on various matters. The Committee therefore concludes that the Tribunal did not act as an *amiable compositeur*, as Ecuador claims. Thus, Ecuador's case regarding the Tribunal's manifest excess of powers fails.\n\n550.\n\nIn conclusion, by deciding to award Perenco damages amounting to US$448,820,400 the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers, nor failed to state reasons for its decision. The only amounts to be deducted from the amount of damages of US$448,820,400 are the ones resulting from the Committee's findings at paragraphs 470 and 574 of the present decision.\n\n**(5) Grounds on the Tribunal's decision to apply a post-award interest rate equivalent to LIBOR for three-month borrowings plus two percent, compounded annually, until the date of payment**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n551.\n\nEcuador contends that by deciding to apply a post-award interest \u201cat a rate of LIBOR for three-month borrowing plus two percent, compounded annually,\u201d the Tribunal (i) manifestly exceeded its powers, and (ii) failed to state the reasons for its decision.490\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 483.\n\n552.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador observes that the Tribunal granted Perenco an interest rate which that Party had not requested, and which, in December 2019, when post-award interest started to accrue, was twice as high as the rate Perenco actually requested: the equivalent to the historical yield of the 10-year of U.S Treasury note (on December 1, 2019, the rate was of 1.86%). In so deciding, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.491\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 488.\n\n553.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador contends that the Tribunal did not devote even a single sentence in the Award to explain the reasoning underpinning its decision to grant post-award interest at the higher LIBOR 3-month borrowing rate plus 2%, instead of the yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note requested by Perenco.\n\n554.\n\nFor these reasons, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Tribunal's decision to grant Perenco post-award interest at the LIBOR 3-month borrowing rate plus 2%, compounded annually.492\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 491.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n555.\n\nPerenco states that the Tribunal neither exceeded its powers nor failed to state reasons in finding that Perenco was entitled to post-award interest accruing at a rate of LIBOR for three-month borrowing plus two percent, compounded annually.493\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 276.\n\n556.\n\nAs regards the manifest excess of powers, Perenco notes that Ecuador is wrong that the Tribunal exceeded its powers by allegedly granting Perenco \u201chigher-than-claimed post-award interest,\u201d considering that Perenco requested post-award interest at \u201ccommercial, annually compounding rates.\u201d494 Furthermore, the Tribunal had wide discretion to assess the post-award interest rate. Albeit Ecuador claims that Ecuadorian law allegedly prohibits compound interest, it does not explain why domestic law prohibitions on payment of interest would apply to claims under an investment treaty that are also governed by international law. Moreover, Ecuador itself requested in the counterclaim that the Committee order Perenco to pay compound interest at an adequate commercial interest rate.495\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 277.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 225.\n\n557.\n\nAs regards the failure to state reasons, Perenco contends that the Tribunal need not justify its decision to fully compensate Perenco by ordering Ecuador to pay post-award interest at a commercial, annually compounding rate. International tribunals usually dispose of a large margin of discretion when fixing interest. Also, \u201creasons \u2018may be implicit and inferred' from the decision or record and not every \u2018gap' constitutes a failure to state reasons.\u201d496\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 280; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 226.\n\n558.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal neither exceeded its powers nor failed to state reasons in finding that Perenco was entitled to post-award interest accruing at a rate of LIBOR for three-month borrowing plus two percent, compounded annually.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, and failed to state the reasons for its decision to apply a post-award interest \u201cat a rate of LIBOR for three-month borrowing plus two percent, compounded annually.\u201d497\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 483.\n\n560.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador contends that the Tribunal awarded an interest rate that was not pleaded by the Parties. The Committee, however, finds that Perenco requested a compound interest at a commercial rate,498 and so did Ecuador.499 It is undisputed by the Parties that the rate of LIBOR for three months borrowing is a commercial rate of interest. Thus, the Committee finds that the Tribunal's decision is circumscribed to the Parties' requests.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 282, 286(g) (AAE-163); Award, \u00b6 61 (AAE-031).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 284, 287(g) (AAE-163); Award, \u00b6 1009 (AAE-031).\n\n561.\n\nEcuador also manifests that the rate of interest awarded by the Tribunal does not comply with Ecuadorian law. Nonetheless, on the one hand, it is not for this Committee to determine whether or not a given rate complies or not with Ecuadorian law. That determination exceeds the limited powers of *ad hoc* committees. But in addition, even if the Committee had the power to second guess the law applicable to interest, which it does not, it cannot ignore that Ecuador also requested a compound interest at a commercial rate and that it is not challenging the Tribunal's decision to grant interests to Ecuador at exactly the same rate as the one awarded to Perenco. Ecuador's claim regarding the Tribunal's manifest excess of powers fails.\n\n562.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal did not explain why it decided to grant post-award interest at the higher LIBOR 3-month borrowing rate plus 2%, instead of the yield of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note requested by Perenco. Yet, as explained above, the Tribunal granted a \u201ccommercial rate\u201d, as requested by both Parties.\n\n563.\n\nFurthermore, the Committee stresses that the Tribunal was not obliged to follow the rate proposed by the experts, and to the contrary, it had discretion to determine the rate of interest. The Tribunal did explain that the amount of damages had to account for full reparation under international law in order to \u201cwipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\u201d500 Given that interest is part of the full reparation standard, the Tribunal was not obliged to provide further reasons on this point. The Committee therefore finds that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons for its decision to apply a post-award interest \u201cat a rate of LIBOR for three-month borrowing plus two percent, compounded annually.\u201d\n\nAward, \u00b6 324 (AAE-031), referring to *Murphy v. Ecuador*, Partial Final Award, May 6, 2016, \u00b6 481.\n\n**(6) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that the OCP ship-or-pay costs were fully** **tax-deductible**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n564.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, only the portion of the shipping costs corresponding to amounts actually transported through the OCP pipeline was tax deductible. With the exception of three months in 2004, Perenco was never able to produce enough crude from Block 21 to meet its 20,000 barrels per day ship-or-pay commitment with the OCP consortium. Nonetheless, the Tribunal decided that \u201cthere should be full tax deductibility in relation to Block 21's OCP ship-or-pay costs\u201d and that \u201cthis adds US$9 million to the quantum to be awarded to Perenco.\u201d By so deciding, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons for its decision.\n\n565.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador contends that the Tribunal failed to apply Ecuadorian law (specifically the Accounting Rules applicable to the Participation Contracts) to the question of the tax deductibility of Perenco's full ship-or-pay commitment.501\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 511-512.\n\n566.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador states that the Tribunal failed to provide a single line of reasoning to reach its conclusion that the OCP ship-or-pay costs were fully deductible in Ecuador, disregarding mandatory provisions of the Accountability Rules applicable to Participation Contracts. Likewise, the Tribunal failed to provide any explanation for its decision that the costs were worth an additional US$9 million to Perenco, despite the fact that Perenco's expert quantified the value of such deduction at US$10.6 million.502\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 505-509.\n\n567.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal's decision to order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco, insofar as the calculation of such amount includes the value of the deduction to which Perenco was entitled as a result of the full deductibility of its OCP ship-or-pay obligation, must be annulled.503\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 513.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n568.\n\nPerenco states that the Tribunal neither failed to state reasons nor manifestly exceeded its powers by finding that the OCP ship-or-pay costs were fully tax deductible.504\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 282.\n\n569.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Perenco contends that deciding a contested issue that was submitted by the Parties for adjudication, namely the tax treatment for the OCP ship-or-pay costs is within the Tribunal's powers. The Parties debated whether or not Ecuadorian law and practice allowed for full tax deductibility, presented arguments and evidence supporting their positions, and the Tribunal sided with Perenco.505 Although Ecuador claims that the Tribunal did not apply Ecuadorian law and therefore manifestly exceeded its powers, there is no indication that the Tribunal decided to apply a different body of law.506 Furthermore, Perenco alleges that, on the value of the OCP ship-or-pay costs, Ecuador has also failed to demonstrate any prejudice or material effect upon the outcome of the case. To the contrary, Ecuador's damages expert itself expressly agreed that the value of such costs was US$10.6 million. Thus, if anything, the Tribunal gave Ecuador a discount of US$1.6 million in tax-deductible costs.507\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 234.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 290.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 291.\n\n570.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador ignores both the Tribunal's overall damages analysis and that reasons may be inferred from the Award or record. According to Perenco, an award is not subject to annulment if the committee can infer or reconstruct implicit reasons for a decision from the terms of the award and the record before the tribunal.508\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 283; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 232-233.\n\n571.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers nor it failed to state the reasons for its decision that that the OCP ship-or-pay costs were fully tax-deductible.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n572.\n\nThe Committee has been unable to find one single reason in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, in the Award, or in any of the other decisions that form part of the Award, that supports the Tribunal's conclusion stated in paragraph 420 of the Award.\n\n573.\n\nAlbeit in footnote 13 of the Award the Tribunal stated that the quantum experts disagreed on the tax treatment of tariffs applicable to the OCP Pipeline, the Tribunal did not explain what the position of the Parties was in this regard, or whether it agreed with the position of one of the Parties, as claimed by Perenco at the Hearing on Annulment.\n\n574.\n\nThe Committee therefore finds that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its decision that that the OCP ship-or-pay costs were fully tax-deductible. This decision, however, is without prejudice to the Committee's previous finding that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons or manifestly exceeded its powers when deciding to Award Perenco damages amounting to US$448,820,400. As already mentioned in Section III.D.2, the fact that one part of the Tribunal's decision is not reasoned is not enough to annul the whole process of calculation of damages performed by the Tribunal. The Committee therefore concludes that the US$9 million awarded in paragraph 420 of the Award must be deducted from the US$416.5 million awarded to Perenco, prior to the adjustment factor.\n\n575.\n\nIn view of the aforesaid conclusion and for the sake of efficiency, the Committee does not consider necessary to address Ecuador's claim regarding the Tribunal's alleged manifest excess of powers.\n\n**(7) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that Perenco's decision to suspend operations did not contribute to its own losses**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n576.\n\nEcuador claims that by deciding that \u201cPerenco's decision to suspend operation of the two Blocks in July 2009 [\u2026] cannot be viewed as a wilful or negligent act which contributed to the harm that it ultimately suffered,\u201d the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, manifestly exceeded its powers, and failed to state the reasons for its decision. This, considering that the Tribunal \u201cbased its decision on the fact that, as it decided in the Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, Perenco's suspension of operations was justified under Ecuadorian law pursuant to the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* defense.\u201d509\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 515.\n\n577.\n\nEcuador observes that the Tribunal's conclusion that Perenco did not contribute to its losses by suspending operations is based on the Tribunal's decision that Ecuador's non-compliance with the provisional measures amounted to a breach of contract and that Ecuador breached the Participation Contracts by issuing Decree 662. Such decisions, in turn, led the Tribunal to its decision to order Ecuador to pay US$448,820,400 to Perenco. Therefore, the Tribunal's decision on Perenco's compensation must also be annulled.510\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 522.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n578.\n\nPerenco contends that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers, seriously depart from a fundamental rule of procedure, or fail to state reasons when deciding that Perenco did not contribute to its own losses by suspending operations.511\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 293.\n\n579.\n\nEcuador \u201ccannot appeal the Tribunal's finding that \u2018the various claims of contributory negligence are unavailing' and that \u2018Perenco's decision to suspend operation of the two Blocks in July 2009, which the Tribunal has already found in its Decision could be justified under Ecuadorian law, cannot be viewed as a willful or negligent act which contributed to the harm that it ultimately suffered.'\u201d512\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 294.\n\n580.\n\nAccordingly, there are no grounds to annul the Tribunal's finding that Perenco did not contribute to its own losses.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, when deciding that Perenco's decision to suspend operations in the two Blocks did not contribute to its own losses, (i) \u201cthe Tribunal relied on a textual interpretation of Article 1568 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code which neither Party had advanced,\u201d513 and therefore seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure; (ii) \u201cthe Tribunal assumed that the provisions of the Ecuadorian Civil Code apply in all circumstances to private and administrative law contracts,\u201d514 and by so doing, the Tribunal grossly misapplied the law, which amounts to a manifest excess of powers; and (iii) \u201cthe Tribunal failed to state the reasons upon which it based its decision that Ecuadorian law permitted Perenco to suspend performance of its contractual obligations.\u201d515\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 517.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 519.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 521.\n\n582.\n\nThe Committee observes that Ecuador bases its claim on the same arguments advanced in regard to the Tribunal's decision that Perenco was entitled to suspend operations under the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* principle, already addressed in Section IV.B.2.b of the present Decision. The Committee therefore does not consider necessary to repeat its assessment on the same issues, as the same reasoning applies.\n\n583.\n\nGiven that the Committee already dismissed Ecuador's arguments regarding the Tribunal's interpretation and application of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus*, Ecuador's claims regarding Perenco's contributory negligence are dismissed too. The Committee therefore finds no ground to annul the Tribunal's finding that Perenco's decision to suspend operations did not contribute to its own losses.\n\n**D. G****rounds on the** **T****ribunal****'****s findings on counterclaims**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that the strict liability regime of the 2008** **Constitution does not have retroactive effect**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n584.\n\nEcuador notes that in its Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, the Tribunal concluded that the strict liability regime for environmental harm provided for in Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution does not have retroactive effects, and therefore, the fault-based liability regime applied to Perenco from the date it acquired its interests in the Blocks until October 20, 2008, when the amended Constitution entered into force.516 In so deciding, the Tribunal disregarded the public policy exception to the Constitution's prohibition against the retroactive application of law, failed to apply Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution to all the environmental harm identified in Blocks 7 and 21, and reduced Perenco's liability in the amount of US$73,897,100. In so doing, the Tribunal so grossly misapplied Ecuadorian law that it should be considered that it did not apply Ecuadorian law at all and, thereby, manifestly exceeded its powers.517\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 528.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 523-525.\n\n585.\n\nFor these reasons, Ecuador requests the annulment of Tribunal's decision to apply the fault-based regime between September 4, 2002 (when Perenco first acquired its interests in the Blocks) and October 19, 2008.518\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 543.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n586.\n\nPerenco objects Ecuador's position that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power because it wrongly dismissed Ecuador's arguments that the strict liability regime should also apply before October 2008. Perenco states that Ecuador's argument that the Tribunal made an error of law in the way it applied the correct body of law is not a basis for annulment. Ecuador is also wrong that the Tribunal applied Ecuadorian law incorrectly. In fact, the Tribunal addressed and rejected the same arguments that Ecuador presents before the Committee, explaining in detail why the record did not support Ecuador's unprecedented and unprincipled argument that the strict liability regime of the 2008 Constitution should apply retroactively. Finally, even if the Tribunal had exceeded its power in so interpreting Ecuadorian law, it would make no difference to the outcome of the Award, because the difference between the fault-based regime and the strict liability regime was negligible.519\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 298-303.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nThe Committee observes that Ecuador's claim is based on the allegation that the Tribunal \u201cgrossly\u201d misapplied Ecuadorian law when concluding that Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution does not have retroactive effects, and therefore manifestly exceeded its powers. As explained in Section III.B.2, \u201cmisapplication\u201d of the law is not a manifest excess of powers annullable under the ICSID Convention. The Committee in turn must determine whether the Tribunal identified the proper law and endeavored to apply it, which it deems to be the applicable standard.\n\n588.\n\nThe Committee notes that in its Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, the Tribunal properly identified the applicable law, namely, Ecuadorian law. In fact, as recognized by Ecuador:\n\nIn this case it was not disputed that Ecuadorian law was the applicable law to Ecuador's environmental counterclaim. Accordingly, the Tribunal's discussion of \u201cThe Framework of the Applicable Law\u201d in section III.B of its Interim Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim was entirely devoted to discussing Ecuadorian law (i.e., the 2008 Constitution, the Environmental Management Law, the Reglamento Ambiental para las Operaciones Hidrocarbur\u00edferas en el Ecuador (\u201cRAOHE\u201d), and the Texto Unificado de Legislaci\u00f3n Ambiental Secundaria (\u201cTULAS\u201d)) as well as the contracts governed by Ecuadorian law (i.e., the Participation Contracts).520 (Emphasis of the Tribunal)\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 527.\n\n589.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal endeavored to apply such law:\n\nWith respect to Ecuador's contention that the entirety of Perenco's operatorship is to be adjudged under the 2008 Constitution's strict liability regime, the Tribunal does not read the \u201cimmediate application\u201d text of the Constitution to have retroactive effect. The general rule under Ecuadorian law is that laws may not in principle be given retroactive effect and that rule has been continued in the 2008 Constitution. The Tribunal is aware of the \u201cpublic order\u201d exception to the Constitution's prohibition against the retroactive application of law, but it has not been satisfactorily shown that this has occurred in Ecuadorian legal practice. The Tribunal therefore does not agree with Ecuador's arguments in favour of giving the Constitution's regime of strict liability an application which to the Tribunal appears to be retroactive. Based on its understanding of the Ecuadorian case law that the Parties put before the Tribunal in their pleadings and reviewed with the legal experts at the hearing, a distinction must be drawn between the pre-and post-2008 constitutional regimes.521\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 356 (AAE-106).\n\n590.\n\nThe fact that the Tribunal did not uphold Ecuador's interpretation of the Ecuadorian law that Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution applied retroactively, and conversely concluded that the strict liability environmental regime set out in Article 396 could not be applied retroactively is not a ground for annulment. Even if the Committee were to find that Ecuador's interpretation is correct, a difference of interpretation on the applicable law is not a ground for annulment.\n\n591.\n\nThe Committee thus finds that Ecuador's claim fails as the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers by deciding that Article 396 of Ecuador's Constitution did not apply retroactively.\n\n**(2) Grounds on the Tribunal's finding that Perenco is only liable for the mud** **pits it built or used**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n592.\n\nEcuador objects the Tribunal's decision that Perenco can only be held liable for the period commencing on September 4, 2002 and, therefore, \u201cPerenco cannot be held liable for pits constructed by prior operators which it itself did not use, because by definition it would be able to show that any damage caused from leachates escaping from such pits cannot be attributed to it.\u201d As a result, the Tribunal's Environmental Expert did not evaluate all mud pits in the Blocks, and, in the Award, the Tribunal held Perenco liable only for mud pits it built or used.522\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 553.\n\n593.\n\nUnder Ecuadorian law, Perenco had an obligation to monitor, maintain and remediate mud pits built by prior operators, thus, it should be held liable for all mud pits that\u2014although built by prior operators\u2014ruptured or leached (for example, due to lack of maintenance or monitoring by Perenco) under Perenco's watch. In deciding otherwise, the Tribunal failed to apply Ecuadorian law, thereby manifestly exceeding its powers.523\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 554-559.\n\n594.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal failed totally to discuss Perenco's failure to monitor, maintain and remediate all mud pits, including those that had been built by prior operators. This complete lack of reasoning clearly amounts to a failure to state its reasons and an annullable error.524\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 560-572.\n\n595.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal's decision to limit Perenco's liability to mud pits it built or used after September 2002 must be annulled. Accordingly, the Tribunal's ensuing decision to exclude Perenco's liability for mud pits built by prior operators (which has an impact of US$35.3 million, as quantified by the Independent Expert) should also be annulled.525\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 573.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n596.\n\nPerenco contends that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers. When insisting on causation as a necessary element of liability, it applied Ecuadorian law to conclude that Perenco was not liable for contamination that it did not cause. It correctly limited its investigation of mud pits to the ones that Perenco built or used.526\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 305-309.\n\n597.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons on this issue. Although Ecuador alleges that the Tribunal \u201csimply limited itself to stating\u201d its reasoning in one sentence, \u201cit ignores the Tribunal's extensive analysis in no fewer than *233 paragraphs*, in which it set out the applicable legal framework and its reasoning in detail and in a manner that the Parties can understand.\u201d527\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 304, 310-314.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n598.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons when deciding that Perenco was only liable for the mud pits it built or used.\n\n599.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador alleges that the Tribunal's reasoning is limited to a single sentence stating that Perenco could not be held liable for contamination in mud pits that it did not build or use. The Committee is not persuaded by Ecuador's position.\n\n600.\n\nThe Committee observes that between paragraphs 319 and 448 of its Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, the Tribunal conducted an extensive analysis on the legal framework governing the dispute.528 Among other findings, the Tribunal concluded that:\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6\u00b6 319-448 (AAE-106).\n\n601.\n\nFirst, the 2008 Constitution does not establish *per se* the applicable legal standards governing the environmental conditions on the Blocks and therefore the Tribunal must look at the Ecuadorian technical standards as promulgated by relevant authorities and as applied before and after the promulgation of the 2008 Constitution.529\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 352 (AAE-106).\n\n602.\n\nSecond, Article 396 of Ecuador's Constitution had no retroactive effects and thus the strict liability regime\u2014instead of the fault-based regime\u2014applies to post-October 20, 2008 damages resulting from regulatory exceedances.530\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6\u00b6 353-359 (AAE-106).\n\n603.\n\nThird, despite the previous conclusion, the Tribunal \u201cdoes not see major differences between the two regimes given that: (i) it appears that ultimately all of the experts agreed that even under the strict liability regime there are still questions of causation; and (ii) Ecuadorian law prior to 2008 presumed that the party engaged in a harmful activity was responsible for any environmental damage and the burden shifted to that party to demonstrate that some other party was responsible.\u201d531\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 358 (AAE-106).\n\n604.\n\nFourth, Perenco is only liable for the regulatory exceedances that predate Petroamazonas' operatorship of the Blocks and which have not been overtaken by Petroamazonas' works.532\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6\u00b6 365-370 (AAE-106).\n\n605.\n\nFifth, as regards the fault-based regime, \u201cif a regulatory exceedance occurred, Perenco is to be taken to have fallen below the requisite duty of care and will be held liable unless it can prove on a preponderance of evidence: (i) an occurrence of a *force majeure* event; (ii) that it did not fall below the standard of care in respect of that specific instance of contamination; or (iii) that some other person caused the harm.\u201d533\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 379 (AAE-106).\n\n606.\n\nSixth, the evidence in the record shows that there were environmental problems predating Perenco's operatorship at the Coca-Payamino Field and the Oso 1 platform. Yet, evidence does not suggest major environmental problems.534\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6\u00b6 380-405 (AAE-106).\n\n607.\n\nSeventh, the evidence in the record shows that Perenco was not a responsible environmental manager.535\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6\u00b6 406-447 (AAE-106).\n\n608.\n\nThereafter, between paragraphs 750 and 811 of the Award, the Tribunal specifically addressed the issue of causation and attribution, departing from two fundamental principles: (i) that Perenco cannot be held responsible for any contamination caused by Petroamazonas after it took over the Blocks in July 2009; and (ii) that although Perenco was *prima facie* liable for the contamination in the Blocks, it cannot be held responsible for any contamination that the evidence shows was caused by other operators prior to its assumption of operations in 2002.536\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 764-765 (AAE-031).\n\n609.\n\nAfter analyzing the evidence in the record as regards the state of contamination of the Blocks before Perenco assumed operations, the Tribunal explained that there was a potential of layering of contamination by different operators, which \u201cmilitates in favour of allocating responsibility based on the length of tenure or based on some other weighting factor.\u201d537 According to the Tribunal:\n\nGiven the documentary evidence showing substantial drilling of such wells prior to 2002, it follows that barium exceedances at those sites have been shown by Perenco, on a preponderance of evidence, to have resulted from the actions of its predecessors. Given the location of those wells, together with the mud pits constructed and used by Perenco's predecessors, and the Tribunal has been able to exclude liability, either wholly or partially, for different parts of the various sites investigated.538\n\nAward, \u00b6 807 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 809 (AAE-031).\n\n610.\n\nFinally, in view of its previous findings, the Tribunal explained the methodology it employed for allocating liability between Perenco and previous or succeeding operators:\n\nTo be clear: before using a time-based weighting system in respect to a particular site, areas within the site that could be clearly designated as \u201cnon-Perenco\u201d or \u201cPerenco\u201d were segregated and placed in the corresponding \u201cbucket\u201d of responsibility. In addition, where other criteria could be used, these were applied in lieu of the time-weighted approach. But sometimes it has been necessary to allocate responsibility between successive operators. So far as prior operators are concerned, the time of first well drilling at a specific site is used as the starting point and July 2009, when Perenco ceased operations in the Blocks, is used as the end date (with the exception of sites where the \u2018Petroamazonas temporal issue' applies). This tends to bias in favour of Perenco, and therefore is a conservative estimate of its responsibility, because it does not consider the possibility of later contaminant release dates and the fact that some fields were drilled but not heavily exploited until Perenco arrived (i.e., Oso and Yuralpa). As for any allocation as between Perenco and Petroamazonas, to the limited extent that it is used (for the reasons previously given), the time-weighted system uses July 2019 as the end date. This is relevant only for a few sites for groundwater (Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF) and therefore assumes much less importance than the system used for Perenco and prior operators.539\n\nAward, \u00b6 811 (AAE-031).\n\n611.\n\nThe Committee thus observes that the Tribunal did provide reasons for its decision that Perenco is only liable for the mud pits it built or used.\n\n612.\n\nThe Committee will now delve into the specific issues raised by the Applicant as regards the Tribunal's alleged failure to state reasons.\n\n613.\n\nEcuador stresses that without reason the Tribunal excluded three mud pits at Coca 8 and the mud pit contamination at Jaguar 2. The Committee however finds that the Tribunal did provide reasons for so doing.\n\n614.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal stated that Perenco was only liable for the damage caused by the mud pits it built or used. This issue has already been discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this Decision. Second the Tribunal remarked, specifically referring to the Coca-Payamino field, that \u201cin [its] view, it is more likely than not that *Petroproducci\u00f3n* and other operators at the time caused damage.\u201d540 Therefore, it can be inferred from the above reasoning that the three mud pits at Coca 8 were not included because the Tribunal considered that the contamination at the sites had been caused by *Petroproducci\u00f3n* and not by Perenco. The Committee stresses that the Award must be read as a whole and therefore the overall analysis of causation and liability made by the Tribunal must be considered.\n\nAward, \u00b6 800 (AAE-031).\n\n615.\n\nAs to the Jaguar 02 field, the Tribunal explained that \u201cin Jaguar 02, drilled in January 1994 and taken out of service in 2000, and therefore only operated by Perenco's predecessors, there was a pre-existing non-Perenco mud pit which experienced a slope failure. This was not attributed to Perenco.\u201d541 The Committee finds that such proposition is consistent with the Tribunal's decision that Perenco could not be held liable for damage caused by other operators.\n\nAward, \u00b6 885 (AAE-031).\n\n616.\n\nThe Committee thus finds that the Tribunal stated either implicit or explicit reasons for excluding the contamination from the three mud pits at Coca 8 and the mud pit at Jaguar 02 from the allocation of responsibility to Perenco.\n\n617.\n\nEcuador further stresses that the Tribunal did not provide reasons to explain \u201cwhy the fact that mud pits were built by prior operators would excuse Perenco of its obligation in Articles 12 and 59 of the RAOHE to regularly monitor, maintain and remediate the environmental conditions around mud pits.\u201d542\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 502.\n\n618.\n\nThe Committee notes that although the Tribunal did not expressly refute Ecuador's interpretation of Articles 12 and 59 of the RAOHE, in its Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, the Tribunal did explain its \u201cfindings on the regulatory standards that should be applied.\u201d543 Particularly, the Tribunal addressed the following issues:\n\n(i) whether RAOHE Annex 2, Table 6 represents the comprehensive list of contaminants when testing for environmental damage as a result of hydrocarbon operations or whether TULAS Tables 2 or 3 provide additional remediation criteria that should be applied; (ii) whether the regulatory criteria in Ecuador requires the use of \u201cindicator parameters\u201d when testing for contamination of the environment by hydrocarbon activities; (iii) which land-use classification should be applied under Ecuador's regulatory criteria; (iv) whether Table 7(a) or Table 7(b) of RAOHE applies to the testing of the mud pits in the two Blocks; and (v) in relation to groundwater testing, whether Ecuadorian regulatory criteria for groundwater testing admit of filtration in collecting samples.544\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6\u00b6 457-569 (AAE-106).\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 458 (AAE-106).\n\n619.\n\nMoreover, when explaining \u201cthe approach to the testing and evaluation of mud pits,\u201d the Tribunal indicated that:\n\nAlthough it recognises that Ecuador's primary case was premised principally on the full restoration objective, the Tribunal considers that drilling muds and cuttings are properly disposed of under the current regime if: (i) they are placed in properly constructed and graded pits as required by law; (ii) the operator properly treated the contents of the pits so as to ensure that it did not deposit muds and cuttings that contained analytes in quantities in excess of the applicable regulations; (iii) the pits have been properly covered and closed; and (iv) soil sampling at places around the pits shows no sign of leaching.\n\n620.\n\nAfter presenting its assessment of the evidence and the applicable standards,545 the Tribunal presented its conclusions on the mud pits issue, as follows:\n\n(a) Table 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE provides the applicable technical standard.\n\n(b) Perenco has no obligation to dig up and remediate properly constructed and confined mud pits whose contents do not exceed the applicable regulatory standard.\n\n(c) At the same time, it was not improper for IEMS to sample the contents of closed mud pits to determine whether or not they exceeded the permissible tolerances contained in Table 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE or contained substances that should not have been deposited in the first place.\n\n(d) Drilling muds and cuttings are properly disposed of under the current regime if: (i) they are placed in proper pits as required by law; (ii) the operator properly treated the contents of the pits so as to ensure that it did not deposit muds and cuttings that contained analytes in quantities in excess of the applicable regulations or other substances that should not have been deposited therein; (iii) the pits have been properly covered and closed; (iv) such pits are constructed with proper berms and at grade; and (v) that soil sampling at places around the pits shows no sign of leaching.\n\n(e) As to whether regard should be had to Table 7(a) or 7(b), if a pit has an impermeable liner, Table 7(b) applies. Conversely, if there is no impermeable liner, Table 7(a) applies. The Appendix A to Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief on Counterclaims, Schedule of Closed Pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, shows that the Parties continue to have substantial disagreements as to whether or not certain pits have been closed with impermeable liners. This will be the subject of further investigation (as to which see below). In any case of doubt, the more environmentally protective standard set out in Table 7(a) shall be applied.\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6\u00b6 501-525 (AAE-106). Footnotes omitted.\n\n621.\n\nThus, the fact that the Tribunal did not explicitly reason the Award by expressly refuting Ecuador's interpretation of the law\u2014but rather by explaining how, in the view of the Tribunal, the law should be interpreted\u2014, does not mean that the Tribunal did not explain its views on whether Perenco could be held liable for the pits built and used prior to its operatorship. It is not on the Committee to second-guess what the Tribunal's approach should have been and how the Tribunal should have answered the question posed by the Parties. That is part of the Tribunal's choice of methodology.\n\n622.\n\nAs explained in Section III.C.2,546 pursuant to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal had the obligation to address every question submitted to it. The question submitted by the Parties was whether Perenco was responsible for the contamination caused by its predecessors. The Tribunal answered the question and provided reasons for its conclusion. The Committee thus finds that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSee footnote No. 98.\n\n623.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal failed to apply Ecuadorian law by ignoring that \u201coilfield operators are bound to regularly monitor, maintain and remediate the environmental conditions of and around existing mud pits, including historical mud pits (i.e., built by prior operators) in the areas where they operate.\u201d547\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 556.\n\n624.\n\nThe Committee stresses that while Ecuador may disagree with the Tribunal's interpretation and application of the law, as explained above, the Tribunal properly identified the applicable law\u2014which is undisputed by the Applicant\u2014and endeavored to apply such law. The Committee therefore has no basis to conclude that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(3) Grounds on the Tribunal's decision to allocate liability between Perenco and other operators of Blocks 7 and 21**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n625.\n\nThe Applicant contends that by reducing Perenco's liability for the environmental harm found in Blocks 7 and 21 on account of the purported liability of other prior and successive operators of such Blocks, the Tribunal asserted jurisdiction over entities beyond its limited jurisdiction and failed to apply Ecuadorian law on joint liability. Thereby, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.548\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 576.\n\n626.\n\nIn relation to the excess of jurisdiction over third parties, the Applicant notes that despite the Tribunal having acknowledged that \u201cit lacks jurisdiction to assess damages payable by non-parties to the arbitration,\u201d549 it did assess damages payable by non-parties to the arbitration when it reduced Perenco's liability by US$73,897,100 on account of the liability attributed by the Tribunal to prior operators and to Petroamazonas, over whom it did not have jurisdiction. In so doing the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.550\n\nAward, footnote 886 (AAE-031). See also, Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 166 (AAE-106).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 586.\n\n627.\n\nIn relation to the applicable law, Ecuador argues that in accordance with Ecuadorian law (Article 2217 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code), where the environmental harm has been caused by several polluters (i.e., responsible for the same tort), each one of them is jointly liable to compensate the full amount of the relevant harm. Yet, despite being aware of Ecuadorian law on joint liability, the Tribunal disregarded it, manifestly exceeding its powers.551\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 577-582.\n\n628.\n\nBased on the above reasons, Ecuador requests the annulment of the Tribunal's decision to limit Perenco's liability to environmental harm occurring in the Blocks between September 4, 2002 and July 16, 2009, and the ensuing decision to reduce the damages Perenco owes to Ecuador by US$73,897,100.552\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 590.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n629.\n\nPerenco argues that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers in apportioning liability between Perenco and other operators.553 The Tribunal not only endeavored to apply the proper law, but also applied it correctly. The Tribunal based its decision on principles of causation and joint and several liability under Ecuadorian law. The fact that the Tribunal did not uphold Ecuador's mistaken interpretation of Article 2217 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code is no ground for annulment.554\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 316; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 267-268.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 269.\n\n630.\n\nAlso, the Tribunal did not exercise jurisdiction over non-party operators in finding Perenco liable for only part of the damages.555 Upon obtaining the Tribunal Expert's quantification of the total extent of the remediation required in the Blocks, the Tribunal allocated the relevant part of that total to Perenco.556\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 274-276.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 276.\n\n631.\n\nHence, Ecuador failed to establish that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when deciding to apply the principles of joint and several liability and causation under Ecuadorian law in order to apportion liability between Perenco and other operators.557\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 277.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n632.\n\nEcuador contends that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the proper law and by exercising jurisdiction over third parties.\n\n633.\n\nAs to the failure to apply the law, Ecuador states that the Tribunal failed to apply Article 2217 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, providing for joint and several liability for environmental harm. The Committee however is not convinced by Ecuador's position.\n\n634.\n\nThe Applicant does not contest that the Tribunal properly identified the applicable law, but that it failed to apply Article 2217 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, as interpreted by Ecuador. Even though the provision invoked by Ecuador does provide for a rule on joint and several liability, as explained in Section IV.D.2.b above, pursuant to its interpretation of Ecuadorian law\u2014mainly as regards the fault-based regime\u2014, the Tribunal concluded that causation was paramount when determining the allocation of responsibility and therefore Perenco could not be held liable for environmental damages it did not cause. The Tribunal did not uphold Ecuador's interpretation that Article 2217 was the applicable rule of Ecuadorian law to allocate responsibility and thereby Perenco and prior operators were jointly and severally liable. The Tribunal opted for a theory of causation under Ecuadorian law to allocate liability based on who may have caused the damage. One may disagree with such interpretation, but a mere disagreement on the interpretation is not a ground for annulment. The Tribunal identified the proper law\u2014Ecuadorian law\u2014and endeavored to apply it. Whether the interpretation of Ecuadorian law is or not correct is not for this Committee to review.\n\n635.\n\nAs to the \u201cexcess of jurisdiction\u201d, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not exercise jurisdiction over third parties. Under its interpretation of Ecuadorian law as regards causation, the Tribunal decided what should be the starting point in time to allocate liability to Perenco and then proceeded to allocate the quantum of remediation corresponding to Perenco.\n\n636.\n\nIn deciding the amount attributable to Perenco, the Tribunal did not exercise jurisdiction over other operators nor allocated liability to other operators for three main reasons:\n\n637.\n\nFirst, the decision of the Tribunal as regards its jurisdiction and the merits is only binding on Perenco, not on the operators that were not a party to the arbitration. This is undisputed between the Parties.\n\n638.\n\nSecond, neither the Award nor any of the other decisions of the Tribunal determined the total extent and amount of the liability of each of the operators of the Blocks, other than Perenco and Burlington, or whether their liability is joint and several or not.\n\n639.\n\nLast but not least, in the Award, the Tribunal calculated the remediation costs attributed to Perenco by deducting from the total quantum of remediation the damages that were found to be caused by other operators. That does not mean, as suggested by Ecuador, that the Tribunal exercised jurisdiction over the other operators of the Blocks. The only amount that is final and binding is the one allocated to Perenco.\n\n640.\n\nIn sum, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers when deciding to allocate liability between Perenco and other operators of Blocks 7 and 21.\n\n**(4) Grounds on the Tribunal's decision to apportion liability for environmental remediation between Perenco, Petroamazonas, and prior operators**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n641.\n\nEcuador observes that in the Award the Tribunal decided that for ground water remediation costs, the Tribunal not only allocated costs as between Perenco and its predecessors, but also included Petroamazonas in the time-weighted allocation, using July 2019 as the end date. In so doing, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, and failed to state the reasons for its decision.558\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 592.\n\n642.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to state any reasons (i) for its decision to apportion liability between Perenco and Petroamazonas for ground water contamination at Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF, as well as (ii) for its calculation of the groundwater remedial costs attributed to Petroamazonas.559\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 593-618.\n\n643.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador contends that in deciding to attribute liability for groundwater contamination at Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF between Perenco, Petroamazonas and prior operators, the Tribunal resorted to its own notion of equity and adopted a \u201ctime-based weighing system\u201d, disregarding the application of Article 2217 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code. Furthermore, the Tribunal asserted jurisdiction it did not have over Petroamazonas and prior operators. In so doing, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.560\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 619-624.\n\n644.\n\nFor the above reasons, Ecuador requests that the Committee annul the Tribunal's decision to limit Perenco's liability to groundwater contamination occurring in the Blocks between September 4, 2002 and July 16, 2009. Accordingly, the Tribunal's ensuing decision to allocate liability for groundwater contamination between Perenco, Petroamazonas and prior operators using a time-weighing system\u2014exonerating Perenco from payment of US$4,717,790 in remediation costs for groundwater at Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF641\u2014should also be annulled.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n645.\n\nPerenco argues that the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers nor failed to state reasons when deciding to allocate groundwater liability between Perenco and other operators.561\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 278.\n\n646.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Perenco asserts that the Tribunal applied Ecuadorian law and it did so correctly because Perenco cannot be jointly and severally liable with prior or successor operators. Also, the Tribunal did not assert jurisdiction over Petroamazonas and prior operators when determining that those other operators would be liable for environmental harm.562\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 327.\n\n647.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Perenco contends that while Ecuador may disagree with the substance of the Tribunal's findings, the Tribunal gave reasons for its decision to rely on a time-based weighing method to allocate groundwater costs at Gacela 1/CPF, Coca 2, and Payamino 1/CPF.563 Likewise, the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons when quantifying damages owed for groundwater liability; \u201cthe standard for a failure to state reasons does not require that Ecuador be able to reverse engineer the Tribunal's calculations on quantum, but solely that \u2018reasons\u2014albeit \u201cvery limited\u201d\u2014must be given.'564\u201d Finally, the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons when relying on July 2019 as the end date for allocating groundwater liability on a time basis. In its Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, the Tribunal \u201cexplained that \u2018[s]ince Perenco ran the Blocks from late 2002 until mid-July 2009 (roughly six and a half years) and Petroamazonas has operated them from mid-July 2009 *to the present day* (roughly five and a half years) the allocation will be based on the amount of time in which the Blocks have been under the stewardship of the two operators (e.g., 55/45%).'\u201d565\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 328-334; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 280; Tr., Day 1 January 12, 2021, Perenco's Opening Statement, p. 47.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 286.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 290.\n\n648.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers nor failed to state reasons when holding that, under Ecuadorian law, Perenco was only liable for the groundwater contamination that the Consortium\u2014and not the prior or successor operators\u2014caused.566\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 295.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n649.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons when deciding to apportion liability for groundwater remediation between Perenco, Petroamazonas and prior operators on the basis of the time-period each had operated the Blocks until July 2019.567\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 530-561.\n\n650.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, the Committee notes that the arguments advanced by Ecuador to support its position regarding the Tribunal's alleged failure to apply the law are very similar to those presented to request the annulment of the Tribunal's decision to allocate liability between Perenco and the other operators of Blocks 7 and 21, analyzed in Sections IV.D.2.b and IV.D.3.b above. The Committee thereby refers the Parties to the analysis conducted in those sections for the substantiation of its decision that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers when deciding to apportion liability for environmental remediation between Perenco, Petroamazonas, and prior operators.\n\n651.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador claims that the Tribunal failed to state reasons (i) for its decision to allocate liability between Perenco and Petroamazonas for ground water contamination at Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF, (ii) for its calculation of liability pursuant to the \u201ctime-based weighting system\u201d; and (iii) for its decision to rely on July 2019 as the end date for allocating groundwater liability on a time basis.568\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 533-554.\n\n652.\n\nIn relation to allocation of liability, the Committee observes that the Tribunal did state reasons for its decision to allocate liability between Perenco and Petroamazonas for ground water contamination at the three sites.\n\n653.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal explained its application of the \u201ctime-weighted sharing\u201d approach to allocate remedial costs for groundwater, indicating that:\n\nTime-weighted sharing was used for soil contamination (when the record evidence could not be used to allocate costs, as noted in paragraph 883 above), and groundwater impairment. For example, with respect to the Gacela 02/CPF, for the groundwater impairment downstream of the API separator, the Tribunal considered it appropriate to allocate some responsibility to Petroamazonas due to its continued use of the separator. For the groundwater impairment to the southeast of the facility, the soil samples were collected shortly after Perenco's tenure came to an end and responsibility therefor is allocated as between Perenco and its predecessors. As a result, Perenco was assigned US$452,530 in remedial costs, its predecessors were assigned US$458,990, and Petroamazonas was assigned US$485,480 in remediation costs.569\n\nAward, \u00b6 887 (AAE-031).\n\n654.\n\nThen, the Tribunal explained that the results of such application are set out in Annex A to the Award:\n\nThe approach taken by the Tribunal, as just described, had been applied to each site and the results of this process are set out in Annex A to this Award which sets forth the Tribunal's findings in tabular form for: (i) sites where Perenco used mud pits and/installed crude oil production wells; (ii) sites where responsibility for soil remediation is allocated between prior operators and Perenco; (iii) groundwater sites where responsibility is allocated between prior operators, Perenco, and Perenco's successor; and (iv) certain other sites that the Tribunal has accepted give rise to responsibility on Perenco's part.570\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 887-888 (AAE-031).\n\n655.\n\nAt Table 3 of Annex A to the Award \u201cAllocation of Remedial Responsibilities \u2013 Sites Affected with Groundwater)\u201d571, the Tribunal indicated the time-based allocation of remedial costs for groundwater, and presented its analysis on, among other, Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF sites.\n\nAward, Annex A, Table 3, p. 4 (AAE-031).\n\n656.\n\nIn respect to Coca 02/CPF, the Tribunal explained that:\n\nThe affected areas of groundwater next to the non\u2010Perenco mud pit and the pre\u2010Perenco formation water pit are attributed to Perenco's predecessors. In the swampy area to the southeast of the CPF, potential contributions by Petroamazonas to groundwater from continued use of the API separator cannot be discounted.572\n\nAward, Annex A, Table 3, p. 4 (AAE-031).\n\n657.\n\nAs regards Gacela 1/CPF, the Tribunal observed that:\n\nIn the affected area of groundwater downstream of the API separator at Gacela 1/CPF, potential contributions by Petroamazonas to groundwater from continued use of the API separator cannot be discounted. For the groundwater to the southeast of the facility, the soil samples were collected shortly after Perenco's tenure and limit responsibility to Perenco and its predecessors.573\n\nAward, Annex A, Table 3, p. 4 (AAE-031).\n\n658.\n\nAs to Payamino 01, CPF, the Tribunal stated that:\n\nIn the affected area of groundwater impairment adjacent to the stream to the northwest of the Payamino 1/CPF, potential contributions by Petroamazonas to groundwater resulting from its continued use of the CPF cannot be discounted. For the affected area of groundwater in the catchment area to the west of the CPF, the soil samples were collected shortly after Perenco's tenure and limit responsibility to Perenco and its predecessors.574\n\nAward, Annex A, Table 3, p. 4 (AAE-031).\n\n659.\n\nThe Committee finds that the reasons provided by the Tribunal are not frivolous, absurd or irrelevant. The record of the Underlying Arbitration shows that the Tribunal based its decision on the findings of the Tribunal's Independent Expert and are pertinent to resolve the question posed by the Parties.575 Albeit Ecuador may consider said reasons to be \u201cinsufficient\u201d or \u201cinadequate\u201d,576 as noted in Section III.D.2 above, \u201cinsufficient reasons\u201d is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e). Ecuador's argument thus fails.\n\nReport of the Tribunal's Environmental Expert with Parties' Consolidated Comments, pp. 149, 219 (AAE-100); Tribunal's Expert Report, Attachment 1-2, Site Dossier, Coca 2-CPF, p. 19 (CEA-161).\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 539.\n\n660.\n\nEcuador also claims that the Tribunal contradicted itself on three main points, thereby failing to state reasons.\n\n661.\n\nThe first alleged contradiction is that, in the Section \u201cthe Tribunal's Findings\u201d, the Tribunal concluded on the \u201c\u2018*Petroamazonas issue*' that the use of a generally applicable discounting factor based exclusively upon a split between the length of time that Perenco and Petroamazonas' operated in the Blocks, would, by itself, be too crude a method for allocating responsibility and insufficiently connected to the record evidence.\u201d577 Yet, in the section \u201cThe Tribunal's quantification of the damages payable by Perenco,\u201d the Tribunal stated in respect to groundwater contamination that \u201callocating responsibility based on time of operation is, in the Tribunal's view, an appropriate method to deal with the uncertainty.\u201d578\n\nAward, \u00b6 785 (AAE-031).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 596\n\n662.\n\nThe Committee does not find a contradiction between the Tribunal's statements. When read as a whole, the Tribunal's reasoning regarding how to allocate responsibility between Perenco and the other operators of the Blocks, including Petroamazonas, shows no contradiction.\n\n663.\n\nThe Committee observes that after explaining its assessment of the evidence in relation to the possible contamination caused by Petroamazonas,579 the Tribunal concluded that:\n\nIn sum, in relation to what might be called the \u2018Petroamazonas temporal issue', given the totality of the circumstances (including the Independent Expert's restricted mandate, his and his team's consultations with the Parties' experts and counsel throughout his sampling activities, and the spill reports and other documents produced by Ecuador), the Tribunal has concluded that the use of a generally applicable discounting factor based exclusively upon a split between the length of time that Perenco and Petroamazonas' operated in the Blocks would, by itself, be too crude a method of allocating responsibility and insufficiently connected to the record evidence. The Tribunal concluded that a closer look at the sites where contamination was found was required before using any discounting factor based on, for example, the respective length of the two operators' tenures.580\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 767-784 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 785 (AAE-031).\n\n664.\n\nThereafter, when presenting its conclusions regarding contamination caused by prior operators at paragraph 811, the Tribunal explained the methodology it implemented to allocate responsibility between Perenco and the other operators of the Blocks, including Petroamazonas:\n\nTo be clear: before using a time-based weighting system in respect to a particular site, areas within the site that could be clearly designated as \u201cnon-Perenco\u201d or \u201cPerenco\u201d were segregated and placed in the corresponding \u201cbucket\u201d of responsibility. In addition, where other criteria could be used, these were applied in lieu of the time-weighted approach. But sometimes it has been necessary to allocate responsibility between successive operators. [\u2026] As for any allocation as between Perenco and Petroamazonas, to the limited extent that it is used (for the reasons previously given), the time-weighted system uses July 2019 as the end date. This is relevant only for a few sites for groundwater (Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF) and therefore assumes much less importance than the system used for Perenco and prior operators.581 (emphasis by the Committee).\n\nAward, \u00b6 811 (AAE-031).\n\n665.\n\nThe analysis in both paragraphs reflects that given its concerns, the Tribunal did not automatically use \u201ca generally applicable discounting factor based exclusively upon a split between the length of time that Perenco and Petroamazonas operated the Blocks.\u201d Instead, if required, the Tribunal \u201ctook a closer look at each site.\u201d This is consistent with the Tribunal's statements at paragraph 811 noting that (i) \u201cwhere other criteria could be used, these were applied in lieu of the time-weighted approach\u201d, and (ii) as regards the allocation between Perenco and Petroamazonas, that the time-weighted system is used to a \u201climited extent,\u201d for the reasons previously explained by the Tribunal in the Award. Therefore, the Committee finds no contradiction, much less a contradiction that amounts to a failure to state reasons.\n\n666.\n\nThe second alleged contradiction is that the Tribunal employed the time-based weighting method, although it considered said method to be \u201cinsufficiently connected to the record evidence,\u201d582 namely because of the lack of evidence of contamination caused by Petroamazonas. Ecuador develops its argument under two main contentions:\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 599.\n\n667.\n\nFirst, that the Tribunal's statement at paragraph 771 of the Award,583 indicates that \u201chad the Parties' experts identified fresh traces of contamination attributable to Petroamazonas in the months it had been operating since July 2009, they would have noted so.\u201d584\n\nAward, \u00b6 771 (AAE-031): \u201cAlthough it cannot be completely ruled out that some contamination was caused by Petroamazonas prior to IEMS commencing its work (or during the time that it took IEMS and GSI to complete their studies), the Tribunal is satisfied that it is unlikely that one or the other of the Parties' experts, particularly Perenco's experts, would have identified any new contamination that they thought occurred after Perenco's operatorship and included it as being caused by Perenco.\u201d\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 601.\n\n668.\n\nSecond, that the contamination confirmed by the Tribunal's Independent Expert relates to the same locations and contaminants that had been identified by the Parties' experts. Yet, none of the Parties' representatives, Ecuador's environmental expert (IEMS), Perenco's environmental expert (GSI), Walsh, the Parties, their counsel, or Burlington observed environmental incidents after July 2009 in the areas analyzed by the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Independent Expert.585 As noted by the Tribunal in the Award, that \u201cthere was no mention in the Independent Expert Report of any recent spills witnessed at sites where Ramboll [i.e., the Tribunal's Environmental Expert] tested.\u201d586 In sum, Perenco did not satisfy the burden of proving that the contamination identified at the Blocks was caused by Petroamazonas.587 The Tribunal therefore concluded that \u201cthe use of a generally applicable discounting factor based exclusively upon a split between the length of time that Perenco and Petroamazonas operated in the Blocks would, by itself, be too crude a method of allocating responsibility and insufficiently connected to the record evidence.\u201d588 Despite all the above, the Tribunal reduced Perenco's liability by US$1,218,5550, corresponding to the groundwater remediation costs identified at Cica 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF, and Payamino 2/CPF. Ecuador argues that this alleged contradiction between the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence and its other findings amounts to a failure to state reasons.589\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 603.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 603, citing Award, \u00b6 784 (AAE-031).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 603-605.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 605, citing Award, \u00b6 785 (AAE-031).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 606.\n\n669.\n\nThe Committee does not see a contradiction between the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence and its other findings. After presenting its assessment of the evidence in the record on whether Petroamazonas also had caused contamination at the Blocks, the Tribunal concluded that \u201cgiven the totality of the circumstances,\u201d \u201cthe use of a generally applicable discounting factor based exclusively upon a split between the length of time that Perenco and Petroamazonas' operated in the Blocks would, by itself, be too crude a method of allocating responsibility and insufficiently connected to the record evidence.\u201d The Tribunal therefore decided \u201cthat a closer look at the sites where contamination was found was required before using any discounting factor [\u2026].\u201d590\n\nAward, \u00b6 785 (CAA-043).\n\n670.\n\nThen, when presenting a site-by-site analysis in Table 3 of Annex A to the Award, the Tribunal explained the reasons to allocate responsibility between Perenco, its predecessors, and Petroamazonas for the contamination caused at the Blocks. For the Tribunal, there could be \u201cpotential\u201d contributions by Petroamazonas to groundwater at Coca 02/CPF, Gacela 01/CPF, and Payamino 01/CPF, and therefore it partially allocated responsibility to Petroamazonas for the \u201cpotential\u201d contamination caused at those sites.591\n\nAward, Annex A, Table 3, p. 4 (CAA-043).\n\n671.\n\nEcuador is not satisfied with the fact that the Tribunal decided to allocate remedial costs for groundwater to Petroamazonas at the three sites based on a \u201cpotential\u201d contribution. While the Committee considers that there is room for more clarity in the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence and the conclusions presented at Table 3 of Annex A to the Award, the Tribunal did not contradict itself. At paragraph 785 of the Award, the Tribunal recognized that it could not merely apply a time-based weighting method, but that it had to take a closer look at the sites. When conducting its site-by-site analysis, the Tribunal found that Petroamazonas could have potentially contributed to groundwater contamination at Coca 02/CPF, Gacela 01/CPF, and Payamino 01/CPF, and thereby partially allocated responsibility to Petroamazonas.\n\n672.\n\nAlthough Ecuador may disagree with the Tribunal's decision to allocate responsibility on the basis of a \u201cpotentiality\u201d, such allegation goes to the merits of the case, particularly to the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence. While the Committee may not entirely agree with the Tribunal, annulment under the ICSID Convention has no room for second-guessing the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence. If the Tribunal considered that the burden of proof to allocate responsibility for environmental contamination was satisfied with a \u201cpotential contribution\u201d, the Committee must not intervene in the Tribunal's decision.\n\n673.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee finds no contradiction and thus no failure to state reasons.\n\n674.\n\nThe third alleged contradiction is that although the Tribunal manifested that it purported to have \u201ca closer look\u201d at the three sites, in Annex A to the Award, the Tribunal merely stated that \u201cthe potential contributions by Petroamazonas to groundwater contamination cannot be discounted.\u201d592 Ecuador further alleges that the Tribunal's weighing of the evidence was \u201cirrational.\u201d593\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 607.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 543\n\n675.\n\nThe Committee observes that Ecuador's contention is based on the sufficiency of the reasons stated by the Tribunal. As noted in Section III.D.2, the Committee shall not adjudge whether the reasons given by the Tribunal are \u201csufficient\u201d or \u201cadequate\u201d. As regards Ecuador's contention on the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence, the Committee notes that such allegation referring to the \u201cirrational\u201d assessment of the evidence goes into the correctness of such assessment. This is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e), nor under any other ground. The Committee is not competent to determine whether the Tribunal correctly or incorrectly assessed the evidence. By doing so, it would be acting as a court of appeal, which is clearly outside its competence. Ecuador's claim in this regard thus fails.\n\n676.\n\nTurning to the issue of the Tribunal's calculation of the groundwater remedial costs, as already noted at Section IV.D.2.b above, the Tribunal did explain the reasons for applying a time-based weighting approach. For efficiency, the Committee does not consider necessary to address this point again and refers the Parties to the pertinent section.\n\n677.\n\nFinally, the Committee will address Ecuador's contention that \u201cthe Tribunal did not provide reasons for adopting July 2019 as the end date for its time-weighted system of attributing liability for groundwater contamination between Perenco, Petroamazonas and other operators.\u201d594\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 608.\n\n678.\n\nPerenco claims that July 2019 is a \u201cproxy for the date of issuance of the Award\u201d595 and, as explained below, Ecuador does not entirely disagree with such a view.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 340.\n\n679.\n\nThe Committee notes that in the Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, the Tribunal indicated that:\n\nThis issue is complicated by the effluxion of time. The Tribunal considers that the only equitable solution is for a new, proper groundwater campaign to be conducted under its expert's supervision and then an allocation of any remediation costs (if remediation is required) to be made as between Perenco and Petroamazonas. Such sampling shall be taken at the same sites at which the experts took samples. Since Perenco ran the Blocks from late 2002 until mid-July 2009 (roughly six and a half years) and Petroamazonas has operated them from mid-July 2009 to the present day (roughly five and a half years) the allocation will be based on the amount of time in which the Blocks have been under the stewardship of the two operators (e.g. 55/45%).596 (emphasis of the Tribunal)\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 608 (AAE-106).\n\n680.\n\nThe Committee observes that the Blocks remained under the stewardship of Petroamazonas beyond the issuance of the Award and therefore it is apparent that the end date fixed by the Tribunal for allocating liability would be the date of the Award. The issue is, however, that July 2019 is not the actual date on which the Tribunal issued the Award (September 27, 2019).\n\n681.\n\nPerenco provides an explanation for such difference between the dates. On November 21, 2018, the Tribunal stated that it expected to issue the Award by the end of June 2019. Thereafter, the Tribunal held its final deliberation on June 3, 2019, completed the English text of the Award by June 19, 2019, and closed the proceedings as of August 30, 2019. However, the issuance of the Award was delayed because the Independent Expert requested that the Parties agree on and sign a waste manifest for the removal of waste derived from the Tribunal's investigation.597\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 340.\n\n682.\n\nEcuador recognizes that such explanation is \u201cplausible\u201d. Yet, \u201cimplicit reasons are not enough.\u201d598\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 545, 547.\n\n683.\n\nThe Committee considers that the above explanation is in fact plausible. The Tribunal did explain that the allocation of liability based on the time-weighting system it implemented would be based on the amount of time in which the Blocks have been under the stewardship of the two operators. Given that Petroamazonas continued operating through the date of issuance of the Award, it is apparent that the end date would be the date of issuance of the Award. When concluding the Award's drafting on June 2019, the Tribunal estimated that the date of issuance would be July 2019, however, the Tribunal did not release the Award until September 2019.\n\n684.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal might have committed an error by not updating the July 2019 date at paragraph 811 of the Award, the remedy of annulment as provided by the ICSID Convention is not envisaged for correcting errors, another remedy is available for that purpose. The Committee notes that under Article 49 of the ICSID Convention, the Parties could have requested that the Tribunal rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the Award within 45 days after the Award was rendered. However, none of the Parties requested that the Tribunal correct the July 2019 date. Annulment is not the opportunity to make such correction.\n\n685.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers nor failed to state reasons when it decided to apportion liability for environmental remediation between Perenco, Petroamazonas, and prior operators\n\n**(5) Grounds on the Tribunal's decision to treat the amount paid by Burlington to Ecuador as a down payment on the counterclaims**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Parties' Position**\n----------------------------\n\n**(i) Applicant's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n686.\n\nEcuador states that the Tribunal assumed without any basis or reasoning that 100% of the damages awarded by the *Burlington* tribunal corresponded exactly to the same damages it ascertained in its Award. The Tribunal treated, without any analysis, the full amount awarded by the *Burlington* tribunal as a down payment by Perenco both with respect to the environmental and infrastructure counterclaims, as if there was a perfect overlap between the harm identified by each tribunal. However, this was not the case. In so doing, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, and failed to state the reasons upon which its assumption is based.599\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 629-630.\n\n687.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, the Tribunal failed to assess whether the \u201csame damage\u201d had been compensated by the *Burlington* tribunal both for environmental and infrastructural damages. Instead, the Tribunal simply assumed, without any basis or reasoning that 100% of the environmental harm for which the *Burlington* tribunal had ordered remediation was already part of the same harm identified by the Tribunal's Independent Expert. Likewise, the Tribunal treated the amounts awarded by the *Burlington* tribunal as a lump sum, instead of comparing the harm to be compensated. As a result, the Tribunal deprived Ecuador of damages amounting to US$81,384.96 for the infrastructure in Blocks 7 and 21.600 In so deciding, the Tribunal resorted to its own subjective notions of fairness and equity, and substituted itself to Perenco, who did not demonstrate the existence of double recovery. Thereby, the Tribunal acted as an *amiable compositeur*, manifestly exceeding its powers.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 632-654.\n\n688.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Ecuador submits that the Tribunal did not provide reasons for deducting over US$39 million from the Tribunal's Award of remediation costs, nor did the Tribunal provide reasons for not asking its Independent Expert to perform the analysis of double recovery proposed by Ecuador to identify any true overlaps in the environmental and infrastructure damages.601 Furthermore the Tribunal contradicted itself by, on the one hand, holding that \u201cit cannot be right for the Tribunal to award the same or part of the same sum twice,\u201d and on the other hand, not verifying whether it was awarding the same sum twice. In so deciding, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 655-660.\n\n**(ii) Perenco's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n689.\n\nPerenco argues that contrary to Ecuador's argument, the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its power nor failed to state reasons when it rejected Ecuador's argument that the *Perenco* and *Burlington* tribunals did not determine the \u201csame loss\u201d or \u2018same harm' caused by the Consortium's operations. \u201cEcuador's mere disagreement with the Tribunal's application of the prohibition against double recovery, which Ecuador agreed should apply in this case, cannot amount to a manifest excess of power. Nor can its mischaracterization of the Tribunal's reasoning establish any failure to state reasons, when the Tribunal amply explained and determined that because both the *Burlington* and *Perenco* tribunals were adjudicating the \u2018same liability,' Burlington's payment of US$42.8 million to satisfy the full infrastructure and environmental liability of the Consortium (*i.e.* both Burlington and Perenco) had to be offset from the damages that Perenco owed Ecuador.\u201d602\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 343.\n\n690.\n\nAs to the manifest excess of powers, Perenco objects Ecuador's position that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law on double recovery because it failed to assess whether the same damage had been compensated by the *Burlington* tribunal. According to Perenco, the Tribunal endeavored to and did apply the principle of double recovery in its decision. Ecuador's disagreement with the Tribunal's decision or an alleged error in interpreting the applicable law cannot establish an excess of power.603 Furthermore, the *Perenco* and *Burlington* tribunals assessed the same liability since \u201cthe underlying claim for which Ecuador has sought compensation in the two arbitrations is exactly the same\u2014*i.e.*, infrastructure and environmental counterclaims arising under the Participation Contracts as a result of Perenco's operations in the Blocks on behalf of the Consortium\u2014and Perenco's and Burlington's underlying joint and several liability is exactly the same.\u201d604\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 345-347.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 347; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 298.\n\n691.\n\nAs to the failure to state reasons, Perenco asserts that the Tribunal did expressly provide reasons for its approach. In fact, the Tribunal rejected Ecuador's approach to assess double recovery on a site-by-site basis, and instead adopted Perenco's approach of offsetting the *Burlington* Settlement from the counterclaim liability. Also, the Tribunal did not contradict itself when it deducted the *Burlington* Settlement from the counterclaim liability.605 \u201cContrary to Ecuador's assertion, the Tribunal rejected Ecuador's argument that the \u2018harm' assessed in *Burlington* and *Perenco* was not the same, and therefore did not have to \u2018verify whether it was awarding the same sum twice' by comparing the damages in both arbitrations on a site-by-site basis. There is thus no ground to annul the Tribunal's conclusion that the *Burlington* Settlement compensated Ecuador for the same infrastructure and environmental liability that the *Perenco* tribunal had to assess.\u201d606\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 347-350.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 350.\n\n**b. The Committee's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n692.\n\nEcuador claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons for its decision to offset the amounts paid by Burlington to Ecuador as a down payment on the counterclaim.\n\n693.\n\nAs regards the manifest excess of powers, Ecuador contends that the Tribunal did not apply the proper law. Although the Tribunal acknowledged that it had to apply the law on double recovery and avoid compensation of the same or part of the same sum twice, it failed to assess whether the same damage was compensated by the *Burlington* tribunal.607\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 632, 636.\n\n694.\n\nThe Committee must in turn examine whether the Tribunal identified the proper law and endeavored to apply it. It is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal properly identified the existence of the law on double recovery. In this regard, the Tribunal emphasized in the Award that:\n\nMindful of the *Burlington* tribunal's statement that \u2018as a matter of principle, the present Decision cannot serve and may not be used to compensate Ecuador twice for the same damage' the Tribunal has thought long and hard about how to protect against double recovery.608\n\nAward, \u00b6 896 (AAE-031).\n\n695.\n\nThe Tribunal also endeavored to apply such law. In paragraphs 890 to 899 of the Award, the Tribunal explained its approach to assess the issue of double recovery on the environmental claim. While Ecuador may disagree with the reasoning or approach of the Tribunal, a mere disagreement is not a ground to annul an award for manifest excess of powers. Therefore, the Committee finds no ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n696.\n\nAs regards the failure to state reasons, Ecuador argues that the Tribunal treated the amount paid by Burlington as a down payment without engaging in the specific assessment of whether there was any double recovery.\n\n697.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the submissions and evidence presented by the Parties in this annulment proceeding, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons for its decision to offset the amounts paid by Burlington to Ecuador as a down payment on the counterclaim.\n\n698.\n\nThe Tribunal's approach to resolve the double recovery issue can be recapped as follows: (i) the Tribunal decided to appoint an Independent Expert to calculate the environmental damage caused by Perenco in the Blocks; (ii) the Independent Expert found that the extent of the contamination caused by Perenco was subject to a larger compensation than the one awarded by the *Burlington* tribunal; (iii) the Tribunal departed from the findings of the *Burlington* tribunal because it considered that the independent expert appointed by the Tribunal calculated and quantified the environmental damage caused by Perenco\u2014i.e. by the Consortium\u2014in the Blocks more accurately than the *Burlington* tribunal; (iv) the Tribunal considered that Perenco and Burlington were jointly and severally liable as members of the Consortium for the environmental damage caused in the Blocks;609 and (vi) given that Burlington had already paid US$39,199,373 for the contamination caused by the Consortium, the Tribunal deducted such payment from the compensation of US$93,638,890 awarded to Ecuador under the Award.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 511, 997 (AAE-031).\n\n699.\n\nThe Tribunal decided in sum that the environmental contamination caused by the Consortium in the Blocks had been partially remediated by Burlington\u2014one of the members of the Consortium\u2014and therefore decided to set off such payment from the total amount awarded to Ecuador to avoid double recovery.\n\n700.\n\nThe Committee is mindful that the site-by-site methodology proposed by Ecuador could be more precise and probably could have been more accurate than the overall approach taken by the Tribunal. However, the Committee cannot go into question the Tribunal's methodology. This would be adjudging the merits of the case, which is not the purpose of the annulment remedy, much less of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n701.\n\nGiven that the whole spectrum of the Tribunal's reasoning on the double recovery issue is to be found in the Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim and in the Award, the Committee will refer to the relevant sections of both decisions to address in more detail the Tribunal's reasoning.\n\n702.\n\nIn paragraphs 890 and 899 of the Award, the Tribunal presented its reasoning regarding the \u201cEffect of the *Burlington* award\u201d. To reach its conclusion that Perenco shall pay US$54,439,517 to Ecuador under the environmental counterclaim the Tribunal based its decision on the following premises:\n\n\u2022 The *Burlington* tribunal left to the Tribunal the question of potential double recovery of damages.610\n\n\u2022 Although there is a substantial territorial overlap between the contamination to be remediated as estimated by the Independent Expert and that estimated by the *Burlington* tribunal, the Independent Expert estimated larger areas and additional contamination, and used higher in-country remediation costs than the *Burlington* tribunal.611\n\n\u2022 Ecuador proposed a site-by-site comparison of areas. Under such methodology it estimated that Perenco was liable for US$130,801,100, plus abandonment costs in addition to the US$929,722 granted by the *Burlington* tribunal for the seven sites listed in Perenco's November 2008 Well Site Abandonment Plan.612\n\n\u2022 Perenco, in turn, argued that the payment made by Burlington under the Settlement Agreement, \u201c\u2018irrevocably, fully and finally paid and discharged, and satisfied' all of the Consortium's obligations and liabilities related to Ecuador's counterclaims.\u201d In the alternative, Perenco claimed that the amount paid by Burlington must be set off from any remediation costs granted to Ecuador, which in any event should result on zero counterclaims damages.613\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal did not adopt either of the positions advanced by the Parties. Moreover, the Tribunal partially departed from the findings of the *Burlington* tribunal considering that: (i) the Tribunal had doubts on the work of the Party appointed experts (IEMS and GSI)\u2014the same experts of the *Burlington* case\u2014and therefore appointed an independent expert; and (ii) in the Tribunal's view, it was more likely that the work performed by the Independent Expert and his team comprehensively and accurately analyzed the work of IEMS/GSI than the *Burlington* tribunal.614\n\n\u2022 For these reasons, the Tribunal arrived to a sum on remediation costs different from the ones awarded by the *Burlington* tribunal. As noted in paragraph 889 of the Award, the remedial responsibilities estimated by Mr. MacDonald amounted to US$85,938,890, the Tribunal then adjusted this sum to add up US$7.7 million to account for certain sites identified by Ecuador.615 The total sum is US$93,638,890. This amount is not only different but greater than the US$39,199,373 paid by Burlington under the Settlement Agreement.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal thereby decided to treat the US$39,199,373 paid by Burlington as a down payment for the total amount of damages, which results in a figure of US$54,439,517.\n\nAward, \u00b6 890 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 891 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 892-893 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 894 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 896-898 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 889 (AAE-031).\n\n703.\n\nThe Committee will now turn to Tribunal's methodology to quantify the damage caused by Perenco, which is the inherent reason explaining the Tribunal's departure from the findings of the *Burlington* tribunal.\n\n704.\n\nIn its Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, the Tribunal set out the environmental standard and the legal basis of the Consortium's liability and presented the Parties' experts' contradictory methods of assessing the environmental harm. It found that both Party-appointed experts were not reliable and therefore chose an independent expert (the \u201c**Independent Expert**\u201d), whose major task was to quantify the totality of the environmental damage by sampling and analysing soil, mud pits, etc. Between paragraphs 568 and 608 of the Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, the Tribunal explained the steps and methodology to be followed by the Parties and the Independent Expert, so that the latter could determine the extent of contamination of the Blocks for which compensation is owed.616\n\nDecision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6\u00b6 568-608 (AAE-106).\n\n705.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal concluded that \u201cMr. MacDonald and Ramboll conducted the sampling exercise transparently and considered suggestions made by the Parties' experts and representatives.\u201d In this regard, the Tribunal referred to the Consolidated Independent Expert Report, where the Independent Expert indicated that:\n\nIt is important to note that the Parties have had the opportunity to pose questions and comment on my work throughout this engagement including before and during the performance of the field campaign. In addition, representatives of the Parties were present during all onsite activities, including the initial exploratory visit to the Blocks as well as during the performance of sample mark-outs and collection of samples from all investigated media. The field program was implemented over a four-month period and issues raised by the Parties during that time were always considered; in certain cases, my approach was adjusted to incorporate expanded information or to address concerns (when these were reasonable and technically valid). It was not always possible to reach full agreement with both Parties, as their commitments to their clients and strategic approaches differed from my own. However, in all cases, a respectful dialogue was established with both Parties, and to my knowledge neither expressed concerns regarding bias for or against either Party in this matter. Relevant correspondence, emails, and other documentation of this dialogue between the Parties and myself or field personnel is included in Appendix B.617\n\nAward, \u00b6 743 (AAE-031).\n\n706.\n\nThe Tribunal further clarified that the Parties were given an opportunity to make submissions and insert comments into the Independent Expert Report, were given the opportunity to cross-examine Mr. MacDonald on both days of the Expert Hearing, and were able to conduct their own laboratory analysis to check the results of the Independent Expert.618\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 745-746 (AAE-031).\n\n707.\n\nAfter having reviewed the Consolidated Independent Expert Report, the Parties' separate written submissions, and the testimony and closing submissions given at the Expert Hearing, the Tribunal observed that:\n\nMost of the questions and objections that the Parties have raised concern technical matters that fall within the Expert's expertise and judgement and the Tribunal considers that it is not appropriate to second-guess his technical determinations. That is why he was appointed in the first place: to provide, in an objective and neutral fashion, the expertise and judgement which the Tribunal considered the Parties' experts had failed to provide.619\n\nAward, \u00b6 748 (AAE-031).\n\n708.\n\nThereafter, the Tribunal analyzed two sets of issues: (i) the allocation of responsibility between Perenco, its predecessors and successor, and (ii) the scope of the Expert's mandate and whether he acted consistently with it.620 The first issue has been extensively analyzed in the present Decision.\n\nAward, \u00b6 749 (AAE-031).\n\n709.\n\nAs to the mandate of the Independent Expert, some of the Tribunal's propositions and conclusions relevant to the Tribunal's methodology to define the double recovery are noted below:\n\n\u2022 Mr. MacDonald was instructed not to perform a *de novo* study of the environmental condition of the two Blocks. This meant that there could be contamination that was not captured by the Parties' experts or the Independent Expert.621 The Tribunal recalled that \u201cthe present exercise is concerned with the accurate and impartial analysis of the work that was done by the experts\u2014who had ample opportunity to examine the Blocks.\u201d622\n\n\u2022 Mr. MacDonald was also instructed not to consider the allocation of responsibility between the Blocks' operators, and to perform its work without regard to the determinations made by the *Burlington* tribunal.623\n\n\u2022 Mr. MacDonald stated that his \u201cinvestigation of soil and groundwater was restricted to areas already sampled by the Parties.\u201d And, his \u201cinvestigation of mud pits was limited to those known to have been used by Perenco.\u201d624 The Tribunal considered that this interpretation of the instructions provided by the Tribunal was not unreasonable and was consistent with the Tribunal's intention to have all mud pits used by Perenco assessed, and not to hold Perenco liable for the damage caused by other operators.625 Thus, the Tribunal considered that Mr. MacDonald acted within the Tribunal's mandate.\n\n\u2022 Ecuador claimed that the Independent Expert did not sample every site where contamination was found by the either of the Parties' experts. The Tribunal agreed with Ecuador and therefore decided to adjust upward by US$7.7 million the damages estimated by Mr. MacDonald.626\n\n\u2022 In regard to the land use, the Tribunal found that Mr. MacDonald and his team surveyed the situation in the two Blocks, studied the record of the counterclaim, and consulted Ministry of Agriculture maps. After conducting the sampling activities, they plotted the delineated areas of contamination on some 51 sites (using aerial photographs). The Tribunal considers that it is not in position to second-guess Mr. MacDonald's determinations and declines to interfere with them.627\n\n\u2022 Albeit Perenco contested the fact that Mr. MacDonald chose the most stringent standard on mud pits, the Tribunal concluded that in the light of the evidence available, Mr. MacDonald was entitled to choose that standard.628\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal decided to leave the Independent Expert approach regarding groundwater contamination undisturbed.629\n\nAward, \u00b6 816 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 816 (AAE-031), citing: Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim, \u00b6 596 (AAE-106).\n\nAward, \u00b6 817 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 819 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 824, 827 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 830 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 841 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 842-850 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 860 (AAE-031).\n\n710.\n\nIt follows from the Tribunal's reasoning that its intention was that the Independent Expert make an impartial calculation of the damages, independent from the positions of the Parties' experts and the findings of the *Burlington* tribunal.\n\n711.\n\nThen, based on the calculations and quantifications made by the Independent Expert, and after some adjustments, the Tribunal proceeded to quantify the damages payable by Perenco, which amounted to US$93,638,890.630\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 876-889 (AAE-031).\n\n712.\n\nAfter reviewing the Tribunal's decisions as a whole and read in context, the Committee also finds that the Tribunal concluded that the contamination caused by Perenco in the Blocks was the same contamination caused by Burlington \u201cgiven that Perenco was the operator, the party with first-hand knowledge of the operations, and therefore the actual (as opposed to the nominal [i.e., Burlington]) author of some of the contamination that the Tribunal's Independent Expert has found in the oilfields.\u201d631 As members of the Consortium, both companies were jointly and severally liable for the damage caused in the Blocks, and therefore the US$39,199,373 paid by Burlington partially covered the remediation costs awarded by the Tribunal to Ecuador. For these reasons, the Tribunal deducted Burlington's payment from the US$93,638,890 compensation.\n\nAward, \u00b6 1002 (AAE-031).\n\n713.\n\nThe Committee sees no failure to state reasons herein, and therefore finds no ground to annul the Tribunal's Decision on the Environmental Counterclaim under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n714.\n\nFinally, in regard to the infrastructure counterclaim, the Tribunal finds no manifest excess of powers and no failure to state reasons either.\n\n715.\n\nIn regard to the manifest excess of powers, it is uncontested that the Tribunal identified the proper body of law on double recovery. Likewise, in paragraphs 905-963 of the Award, the Tribunal endeavored to apply such law. While Ecuador may not agree with the Tribunal's application of the law, that is not a manifest excess of powers.\n\n716.\n\nLikewise, in regard to the failure to state reasons, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did state reasons for deciding that Ecuador has been made whole on the infrastructure counterclaim by Burlington's payment under the Settlement Agreement.\n\n717.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal departed its analysis from the facts that the *Burlington* tribunal had already ruled on and awarded damages in respect of the infrastructure counterclaim. What is more, both tribunals \u201cheard virtually the same evidence about the same breaches and considered the same allegations as to damage, but personally observed the climatic and other conditions when it conducted its site visit.\u201d632\n\nAward, \u00b6 906 (AAE-031).\n\n718.\n\nNotwithstanding, the Tribunal noted that \u201cconsistent with [its] independent duty to consider the case presented to it, the Tribunal will briefly express its views.\u201d633 The Tribunal further stressed that it based its determination of the counterclaim on the following considerations: (i) that \u201cin the declining years of the Blocks Perenco would, on the balance of probabilities, have been less concerned about maintaining the facilities than hitherto;\u201d634 (ii) that there were challenging conditions of operating in the Amazon rainforest and a predisposition towards rust and corrosion in that climate; and (iii) that the Blocks had been operated before and after Perenco's tenure.635\n\nAward, \u00b6 909 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 911 (AAE-031).\n\nAward, \u00b6 912 (AAE-031).\n\n719.\n\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to conduct its own analysis of the infrastructure counterclaim. It analyzed specific issues and presented its own conclusions in relation to the tanks, fluid lines and pipelines, generator engines, pumps, electrical systems, IT equipment and road maintenance, and other claims such as the purchase of back-up equipment, spare parts and materials to bring the operations into line with industry standards.636 From such analysis, the Tribunal decided to grant US$2,315,969.15 to Ecuador under its infrastructure counterclaim.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 927-963 (AAE-031).\n\n720.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal noted that under the Settlement Agreement, Burlington had already paid US$2,577,119 for Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaim. Therefore, to avoid double recovery, the Tribunal concluded that \u201cEcuador has been made whole on the infrastructure counterclaim\u201d by Burlington's payment.637\n\nAward, \u00b6 966 (AAE-031).\n\n721.\n\nThe Committee observes that, in an analysis similar to the one performed on the environmental counterclaim, the Tribunal conducted its own assessment of the submissions and evidence in the record and reached its own conclusion on the calculation and quantification of the infrastructure counterclaim. The Tribunal thereby reached a sum different from the one awarded by the *Burlington* tribunal. However, given that the amount awarded by the *Burlington* tribunal was higher, the Tribunal considered that Ecuador's damage had been totally remediated and therefore decided not to include the US$2,315,969.15 as part of Ecuador's counterclaim damages to avoid double recovery.\n\n722.\n\nIn this sense, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in regard to its decision on Ecuador's infrastructure counterclaim.\n\n723.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the Tribunal neither manifestly exceeded its powers nor failed to state reasons when deciding to treat the amount paid by Burlington to Ecuador as a down payment on the environmental and infrastructure counterclaims.\n\n**E. C****ommittee****'****s** **C****onclusions**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n724.\n\nThe Committee rejects all but two of the twenty specific grounds raised by Ecuador to request the annulment of the Award.\n\n725.\n\nThe Committee decides to annul the Tribunal's decision to award US$25 million to Perenco's loss of opportunity to extend the Block 7 Participation Contract,638 and the Tribunal's finding that the OCP ship-or-pay costs were fully tax-deductible.639\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 469-470 of the present Decision.\n\nSee \u00b6 574 of the present Decision.\n\n726.\n\nIn paragraphs 381 to 422 of the Award, the Tribunal explained how it summed-up the different components to reach the final amount of compensation of US$448,820,400; thereby, at paragraph 411 of the Award, the Tribunal concluded that \u201cthe initial amount of damages estimated to be awarded for Block 7 is calculated to be US$145.2 million and the amount of damages to be awarded for Block 21 is calculated to be US$273.7 million, totalling US$418.9 million (as of September 2016).\u201d The Tribunal then decided to make further adjustments: the \u2018true-up', the OCP Deductibility, and the value of loss of opportunity.\n\n727.\n\nAs regards the \u2018true-up', the Tribunal concluded that \u201ca fair amount for the \u2018true-up' should be US$36.4 million (after discounting and bringing forward the relevant cash flows). Thus, the total compensation for Blocks 7 and 21 is reduced by that sum to US$382.5 million.\u201d640\n\nAward, \u00b6 419 (AAE-031).\n\n728.\n\nAs to the \u201cOCP Deductibility\u201d, the Tribunal concluded \u201cthat there should be full tax deductibility in relation to Block 21's OCP ship-or-pay costs. Accordingly, this adds US$9 million to the quantum to be awarded to Perenco. The amount of US$382.5 million is therefore increased by US$ 9 million to amount to US$391.5 million.\u201d641\n\nAward, \u00b6 420 (AAE-031).\n\n729.\n\nIn relation to the \u201cValue of Loss of Opportunity\u201d, the Tribunal concluded that \u201c[loss of opportunity] should be valued at US$25 million. This sum is added to the amount of US$391.5 million to arrive at a total of US$416.5 million as of September 2016.\u201d642\n\nAward, \u00b6 421 (AAE-031).\n\n730.\n\nThereafter the Tribunal multiplied the US$416.5 million by an adjustment factor of 1.0776 to bring this sum forward to the date of the Award to arrive to a final figure of US$448,820,400.643\n\nAward, \u00b6 422 (AAE-031).\n\n731.\n\nGiven that the Committee decides to annul the Tribunal's decision to add US$25 million corresponding to the loss of opportunity, and US$9 million corresponding to the \u2018OCP Deductibility' to the amount of damages awarded to Perenco, the total compensation should be reduced as follows:\n\n732.\n\nThe US$34 million resulting from the sum of the aforementioned amounts, the only amounts affected by the partial annulment of the Award, should be deducted from the US$416.5 million before applying the 1.0776 adjustment factor. This amounts to US$382.5 million, i.e. the sum reached by the Tribunal after the \u2018true-up' adjustment but before the \u201cOCP-Deductibility\u201d and the loss of opportunity. This sum US$382.5 is then multiplied by the 1.0776 adjustment factor to arrive to a final sum of US$412,182,000.\n\n733.\n\nIn conclusion, the total compensation owed to Claimant at paragraph 1023(a) of the Award should be reduced from US$448,820,400 to US$412,182,000. The rest of the Award remains unaffected.\n\n734.\n\nFinally, the Committee recalls the commitment made by the Applicant in the Minister's Letter on April 20, 2020 as a condition requested by the Committee to grant the stay of enforcement of the Award pending the annulment decision.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A. A****pplicant****'****s** **C****osts** **S****chedule**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n735.\n\nThe Applicant submitted the following schedule of costs:\n\nProfessional fees: US$1,049,543.95\n\nAdministrative costs: US$512,238.37\n\n**B. P****erenco****'****s** **C****osts** **S****chedule**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n736.\n\nPerenco submitted the following schedule of costs:\n\nProfessional fees: US$3,037,668.50 Administrative costs: US$100,615.75\n\n**C. T****he** **C****ommittee****'****s** **D****ecision on** **C****osts**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n737.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n738.\n\nUnder this provision, applicable to this Annulment Proceeding by virtue of Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee has broad discretion in allocating the costs of the proceeding and the Parties' legal costs and expenses.\n\n739.\n\nEcuador alleged twenty (20) grounds for annulment seeking either the total or a partial annulment of the Award. Three (3) of such grounds related to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal which, if successful, would have resulted in the total annulment of the Award. The Committee rejected all of these grounds. Five (5) grounds referred to findings of the Award on the merits,644 which the Committee also rejected. Seven (7) grounds were related to decisions in the Award concerning damages, all of which, but two, were rejected by the Committee. Finally, Ecuador submitted five (5) grounds related to sections of the Award dealing with counterclaims by Ecuador. All of them were rejected by the Committee.\n\nIn its submissions Ecuador invokes five specific grounds on the merits, but the Committee classified them under four headings, given that the Committee classified Ecuador's claims on the Tribunal's findings that \u201cDecree 662 breached the Participation Contracts\u201d, and that \u201cDecree 662 and ensuing measures breached Article 4 of the Treaty\u201d under the same category.\n\n740.\n\nTwo (2) of the petitions on annulment presented by Ecuador have succeeded. The Committee found that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in its decisions on loss of opportunity,645 and tax deductibility of OCP ship-or-pay costs,646 with the result that the total compensation owed to Claimants is reduced from US$448,820,400 to US$412,182,000. The rest of the Award remains unaffected.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 469-470 of the present Decision.\n\nSee \u00b6 574 of the present Decision.\n\n741.\n\nConsidering, on the one hand, the partial success of Ecuador's application and on the other, the fact that a number of the grounds submitted by Ecuador were rejected because they were considered by the Committee as mere appeals of the Award, the Committee has decided that Applicant shall bear 90% and Claimant 10% of the arbitration costs in relation to these proceedings, and that each side shall bear its own litigation costs and other expenses.\n\n742.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Committee's fees and expenses |  |\n| Prof. Zuleta | US$166,199.37 |\n| Prof. Dr. Knieper | US$78,394.23 |\n| Prof. Pinto | US$70,567.00 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | US$84,000 |\n| Direct expenses (estimated) | US$36,299.33 |\n| **Total** | **US$435,459.93** |\n\n743.\n\nClaimant shall therefore reimburse Applicant the amount of US$43,545.99 corresponding to 10% of the arbitration costs in relation to these annulment proceedings. The Committee finds no grounds to award interest on the aforementioned amount.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n744.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the *ad hoc* Committee decides, unanimously, as follows:\n\na. To partially annul the Award rendered on September 27, 2019 by the Arbitral Tribunal in the arbitration proceedings between Perenco Ecuador Limited and the Republic of Ecuador, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, solely and exclusively as regards the Tribunal's decision to award US$25 million to Perenco's loss of opportunity to extend the Block 7 Participation Contract,647 and the Tribunal's finding that the OCP ship-or-pay costs were fully tax-deductible.648\n\nb. The rest of the Award remains unaffected, but as a result of the partial annulment the amount awarded to Perenco Ecuador Limited at paragraph 1023(a) of the Award is US$412,182,000.\n\nc. Applicant shall bear 90% and Claimant 10% of the arbitration costs in relation to these proceedings, and each side shall bear its own litigation costs and other expenses. Claimant shall therefore reimburse Applicant the amount of US$43,545.99 corresponding to 10% of the arbitration costs in relation to these annulment proceedings.\n\nd. The stay of enforcement of the Award is lifted.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 469-470 of the present Decision.\n\nSee \u00b6 574 of the present Decision."}]}
