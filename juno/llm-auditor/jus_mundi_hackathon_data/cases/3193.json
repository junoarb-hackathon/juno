INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. Request for Arbitration and Constitution of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 1 February 2019, Canepa Green Energy Opportunities I, S.\u00e1 r.l. and Canepa Green Energy Opportunities II, S.\u00e1 r.l. (\"**Claimants**\") submitted a Request for Arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") against the Kingdom of Spain (\"**Spain**\" or \"**Respondent**\"). The Claimants and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n2.\n\nOn 25 February 2019, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 8 May 2019, Mr. Peter Rees QC, a national of the United Kingdom, accepted his appointment by the Claimants as arbitrator in this case.\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 May 2019, Professor Silvina S. Gonz\u00e1lez Napolitano, a national of Argentina, accepted her appointment by the Respondent as arbitrator in this case.\n\n5.\n\nOn 11 September 2019, Professor Sean Murphy, a national of the United States of America, accepted his appointment by agreement of the Parties as presiding arbitrator. On the same date, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted on 11 September 2019, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n**B. Mr. Rees\u2019 Disclosures**\n----------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 8 May 2019, Mr. Rees provided a signed declaration and an accompanying statement pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2), copies of which were transmitted by the ICSID Secretariat to the Parties on the same date. In his statement, Mr. Rees disclosed that: *(1)* he was co-arbitrator in the arbitration *Hydro Energy 1 S.\u00e1 r.l. and Hydroxana Sweden AB v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/42, where he was appointed upon the nomination of the investor; ***(2)*** he was co-arbitrator in a pending ICC arbitration, where he was appointed upon the nomination of clients of Allen & Overy LLP (the \"**Firm**\") and counsel were from the Australian office of the Firm; and ***(3)*** he was until recently co-arbitrator in another ICC arbitration, where he was appointed upon the nomination of clients of the Firm and counsel were from the Dutch and UK offices of the Firm. Mr. Rees further stated that neither arbitration referred to in *(2)* or *(3)* above had any connection with the present case and, to the best of his knowledge, none of the individuals involved from the Firm had any involvement in this case.\n\n7.\n\nOn 14 May 2019, the Respondent requested disclosures from Mr. Rees, including with respect to the following:\n\ni. The arbitrations where Mr. Rees was proposed as arbitrator by the Claimants or any of its affiliates, including the date of the appointment, the name of the parties, the amount of the dispute and if the final award was favourable to the Claimants or its affiliates.\n\nii. The arbitrations where Mr. Rees was proposed as arbitrator by the Claimants\u2019 attorneys, including cases managed by attorneys formerly working for other law firms and currently working for the Firm.\n\niii. Information related to Mr. Rees\u2019 remuneration as a member of the Investment Committee of the company Harbour Litigation Funding Limited (\"**HLF**\" or the \"**Company**\") and concerning the disputes funded by HLF.\n\n8.\n\nOn the same date, the ICSID Secretariat transmitted a copy of the Respondent\u2019s request to Mr. Rees.\n\n9.\n\nOn 21 May 2019, at the request of Mr. Rees, ICSID transmitted to the Parties a \"Disclosure by the Arbitrator Appointed by the Claimants, Peter Rees QC\", dated 20 May 2019. Mr. Rees stated in his disclosure, *inter alia,* that:\n\ni. He had never been proposed as arbitrator by Claimants or any of its affiliates.\n\nii. He was previously proposed as arbitrator by clients of the Firm on two occasions. In the first case (handled by the Firm\u2019s Dutch and English offices), he was appointed in March 2016, the case settled, and no award was made. In the second case (handled by the Firm's Hong Kong and Australian offices), he was appointed in September 2018 and the case remained pending. Neither case involved any of the attorneys representing the Claimants in this arbitration.\n\niii. He had been a member of HLF's Investment Committee since February 2015 and his total remuneration since then had been GBP 271,169.20. With regard to disputes funded by the Company, Mr. Rees noted ***(1)*** one case between an investor from a European Union (\"**EU**\") Member State and another EU Member State *(Rockhopper Italia S.p.A., Rockhopper Mediterranean Ltd, and Rockhopper Exploration Plc v. Italian Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/17/14 (\"***Rockhopper**\")),* and ***(2)*** one case before the English High Court where the claimant is represented by the Firm.\n\n10.\n\nOn 30 May 2019, the Respondent requested further disclosures from Mr. Rees concerning, *inter alia,* HLF's documentation related to the *Rockhopper* case, and all investment arbitration proceedings in which Mr. Rees had served as arbitrator. On the same date, the ICSID Secretariat transmitted a copy of the Respondent's request to Mr. Rees.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 June 2019, at the request of Mr. Rees, ICSID transmitted to the Parties a \"Further Disclosure by the Arbitrator Appointed by the Claimants, Peter Rees QC\". In his disclosure, Mr. Rees stated, *inter alia,* that: ***(1)*** the documents related to the *Rockhopper* case requested by the Respondent were confidential to HLF and he did not have access to them; ***(2)*** when funding that case, there had been no discussion at the Company's Investment Committee in relation to the issue of an investor from an EU country making an arbitral claim against an EU State (\"**intra-EU investment arbitration**\"); and ***(3)*** he had been appointed as arbitrator in three other investment arbitrations, the information of which was publicly available at the ICSID website.\n\n**C. Respondent\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Mr. Rees**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 11 October 2019, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Peter Rees, in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (the \"**Proposal**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn the same date, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceeding had been suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Parties were also informed that the Proposal would be decided by the other Members of the Tribunal, Professor Murphy and Professor Gonz\u00e1lez Napolitano (the \"**Unchallenged Arbitrators**\"), in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4).\n\n14.\n\nOn 11 October 2019, the Centre transmitted to the Parties and Mr. Rees the procedural calendar for the submission of written observations on the Proposal, which had been fixed by the Unchallenged Arbitrators.\n\n15.\n\nOn 18 October 2019, in compliance with the procedural calendar, the Claimants submitted their Comments on Respondent\u2019s Disqualification Proposal of Mr. Peter Rees QC (\"**Claimants\u2019 Observations**\").\n\n16.\n\nOn 21 October 2019, Mr. Rees furnished his explanations on the Proposal, as envisaged by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3) (\"**Explanations**\").\n\n17.\n\nBoth Parties were allowed to submit simultaneously additional observations on the Proposal by 30 October 2019. Respondent\u2019s Further Comments Regarding the Disqualification of Mr. Rees (\"**Respondent\u2019s Further Comments**\") were received on 30 October 2019. No additional observations were received from the Claimants.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent\u2019s Submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s arguments on the proposal to disqualify Mr. Rees were set forth in its submissions of 11 and 30 October 2019. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n**1. Applicable Legal Standards**\n---------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent considers as applicable law the sources mentioned in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice: international conventions, international custom, and general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.1\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 6-8.\n\n20.\n\nFirst, the Respondent refers to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention, which must be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\").2 Respondent contends that ***(1)*** in light of the three authentic language versions of the ICSID Convention, Article 14 requires arbitrators \"to be both independent and impartial;\"3 and ***(2)*** these provisions do not require proof of actual dependence or bias, rather, as held in the *Blue Bank* case, it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.4 The Respondent further argues that, as held in the *Burlington* and *Repsol* cases, the applicable legal standard is an \"objective standard based on the reasonable analysis of evidence by a third party.\"5 Moreover, an inference of manifest bias suffices as a basis for disqualification as long as it is anchored to facts.6 The Respondent also refers to Article 47 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.7\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 20 (referring to Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties, 23 May 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331).\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 16.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 70 (referring to *Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20, Decision on the Proposal to Challenge the Majority of the Tribunal Submitted by the Parties dated 12 November 2013 (Respondent's Annex 13) (\"***Blue Bank***\"), \u00b6\u00b6 37 and 58).\n\nProposal, \u00b6 71 (referring to *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on the Proposal to Challenge Mr. Francisco Orrego Vicu\u00f1a dated 13 December 2013 (Respondent's Annex 14) (\"***Burlington Resources***\"), \u00b6\u00b6 65 and 77; and *Repsol S.A. and Repsol Butano S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/38, Decision on the Proposed Challenge of the Majority of the Tribunal dated 13 December 2013 (Respondent's Annex 15) (\"***Repsol***\"), \u00b6\u00b6 71-72).\n\nProposal, \u00b6 73.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 21.\n\n21.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the international custom regarding arbitration demands \"(1) impartiality and independence on the arbitrators; and (2) that they can be disqualified when there is any reasonable doubt about the lack of those qualities.\"8 In Respondent\u2019s view, the use of the term \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention cannot be interpreted inconsistently with international custom that protects the nature of the arbitration.9\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 28. *See also ibid*., \u00b6 79.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 29.\n\n22.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that it is a general principle of international law that adjudicators must be independent and impartial and that they may be disqualified if \"there is any slight doubt that they are biased.\" Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the general principles of law do not require strict evidence nor require the challenging party to prove actual bias; rather, bias can be inferred from the facts of the case.10\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 33-35.\n\n**2. Grounds for Disqualification**\n-----------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent seeks the disqualification of Mr. Rees on four main grounds: ***(1)*** repeated appointments and lack of proper disclosure; ***(2)*** past and present relationship with Claimants\u2019 counsel; ***(3)*** relationship with a litigation fund; and ***(4)*** pre-judgment of a key issue in this case concerning the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over intra-EU disputes. The Respondent stresses that these grounds \"work together and they should be addressed as a unity.\"11\n\nRespondent's Further Comments, \u00b6 4.\n\n24.\n\nFirst, the Respondent proposes that Mr. Rees be disqualified because he has been appointed on three occasions (including this case) by the Firm in the past three years for proceedings where the total quantum exceeds 2 billion Euros, which Mr. Rees failed to disclose in his initial declaration and in his *curriculum vitae.* The Respondent argues that this situation falls within Section 3.3.8 of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration (the \"**IBA Guidelines**\"). The Respondent considers as an aggravating circumstance the silence of Mr. Rees regarding the quantum of the arbitrations where he was appointed by the Firm, and it refers to prior decisions finding that multiple appointments of an arbitrator is an issue relevant to impartiality and independence.12\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 37-48; Respondent's Further Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 8-14.\n\n25.\n\nSecond, the Respondent considers that Mr. Rees ought to be disqualified since he has a longstanding history of working closely with the Firm. The Respondent claims that, while Mr. Rees was the Legal Director of Royal Dutch Shell (\"**Shell**\") from November 2010 to April 2014, the Firm was retained by Shell as its main legal service provider to manage Shell's largest transactions. The Respondent provides a list of examples of such transactions which, in its view, show an old and strong mutual trust relationship between Mr. Rees and the Firm, as it would be highly unusual for the Legal Director not to be involved in the company's largest transactions.13\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 49-58; Respondent's Further Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 15-21.\n\n26.\n\nThird, the Respondent bases its Proposal on the fact that Mr. Rees was a member of the Investment Committee of HLF and that a former associate at the Firm, Mr. Dominic Afzali, is an associate director at HLF. As a preliminary matter, the Respondent submits that the positions of arbitrator and advisor in a litigation fund ought to be considered incompatible due to the serious risks of bias they raise. In this case, Mr. Rees failed initially to disclose his position at HLF and only did so after a disclosure request from the Respondent. The Respondent considers that such silence must have meant that Mr. Rees was aware of the incompatibility of advising on which disputes should be funded and then being appointed as an arbitrator in similar or identical disputes. The Respondent adds that the current position of Mr. Afzali - who was formerly an attorney at the Firm - as an associate director at HLF shows, once again, the relationship and interconnection \"beyond any reasonable line\" between the Firm and Mr. Rees.14\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 59-64; Respondent's Further Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 22-26.\n\n27.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that Mr. Rees should be disqualified because he disclosed that, in the context of HLF considering whether to provide funding in the *Rockhopper* case, there was no discussion at the Company's Investment Committee in relation to the issue of intra-EU investment arbitration. According to the Respondent, this lack of discussion shows that Mr. Rees has prejudged a jurisdictional issue that is critical in this case. In other words, Mr. Rees must have recommended that the Investment Committee finance the *Rockhopper* case, which is an intra-EU investment arbitration, and in doing so must have had a clear idea that a jurisdictional objection to such arbitration was meritless, such that it did not even deserve to be discussed. Therefore, Mr. Rees cannot be regarded in this case as a neutral party with no bias or preconceived ideas on any of the issues in dispute. The Respondent also adds that discussions related to the permissibility of intra-EU investment arbitration predate the March 2018 decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in *Slowakische Republik v Achmea B.V. (Achmea).*15\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 65-69, 82; Respondent's Further Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 27-36.\n\n28.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, the above grounds are obvious, clear and show a manifest lack of impartiality and independence.\n\n**B. Claimants\u2019 Submissions**\n-----------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 arguments on the proposal to disqualify Mr. Rees were set forth in their submission of 18 October 2019. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n**1. Applicable Legal Standards**\n---------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimants refer to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and argue that ***(1)*** these provisions contain the legal standard applicable to the disqualification of an arbitrator (which the Respondent does not dispute); and ***(2)*** the term \"manifest\" contained in Article 57 is significant as it requires the challenging party to show \"evident\" or \"obvious\" bias (i.e. capable of being discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis).16\n\nClaimants' Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, 11.\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the burden of proof for disqualifying an arbitrator is a heavy one as Article 57 imposes an objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party, as opposed to the subjective perceptions or beliefs of the challenging party.17 The Claimants refer, *inter alia,* to the *Vivendi* case, in which it was held that the challenging party must rely on established facts and not on mere speculation or inference.18\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, 14.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 9 (referring to *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Committee dated 3 October 2001 (Claimants' Annex 6), \u00b6 25).\n\n32.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants oppose what they consider to be an attempt from the Respondent to deviate from the proper interpretation of Article 57 in order to apply a different legal standard to that contained in the ICSID Convention. For the Claimants, \"the term *'manifest'* is not an *'additional requirement'* but rather the applicable standard\".19 Furthermore, in view of the clear and unambiguous ordinary meaning of Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, the Claimants consider that there is no basis for the Respondent to refer to other rules of international law.20 Finally, while supplementary means of interpretation may be used to confirm the ordinary meaning of Article 57 of the Convention (as permitted by Article 32 of the VCLT), they may not be used to change the otherwise clear meaning of Article 57 of the Convention.21\n\nClaimants' Observations, \u00b6 9 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 8-13.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 15.\n\n33.\n\nBased on the above, the Claimants request the Unchallenged Arbitrators to apply the standard for disqualification contained in Article 57 of the Convention and disregard the Respondent\u2019s submissions requesting that a different standard be applied.\n\n**2. Grounds for Disqualification**\n-----------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent\u2019s Proposal is devoid of merit and should be dismissed.\n\n35.\n\nFirst, concerning Mr. Rees\u2019 previous appointments by the Firm, the Claimants argue, *inter alia,* that: ***(1)*** Mr. Rees disclosed the two prior cases in which he had been appointed by the Firm in his initial declaration; ***(2)*** Mr. Rees did not initially disclose matters of quantum as this is not required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2); and ***(3)*** upon the Respondent\u2019s request, Mr. Rees disclosed promptly the amount in dispute in the cases where he was appointed by clients of the Firm. As recognized in previous ICSID cases such as *Caratube, Opic* and *Universal Compression,* which applied Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention, the mere fact of holding previous arbitral appointments does not, in itself, indicate a manifest lack of independence or impartiality on the part of an arbitrator. The Claimants further argue that there are no valid grounds for disqualification since none of the cases in which Mr. Rees was appointed by the Firm has any relation to the present dispute and there is no relationship of dependence or influence between the Firm and Mr. Rees. In addition, the Claimants submit that the IBA Guidelines are not binding upon the Unchallenged Arbitrators and, even if they were applied, the case at hand does not fall within the Orange list. Section 3.3.8 of the IBA Guidelines refers to situations involving *more* than three repeated appointments within three years, whereas this case only constitutes Mr. Rees' third appointment, and that appointment took place more than three years after his first appointment on March 2016 by the Firm.22\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 17-29 (referring, *inter alia*, to *Caratube International Oil Company LLP & Mr. Devincci Salah Hourani v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13, Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of Mr. Bruno Boesch (Claimants' Annex 1) (\"***Caratube***\"), \u00b6 108; *OPIC Karimum Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/14, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Prof. Philippe Sands (Claimants' Annex 17) (\"***Opic***\"), \u00b6 53; and *Universal Compression International Holdings, S.L.U. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/9, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Prof. Brigitte Stern and Prof. Guido Santiago Tawil (Claimants' Annex 18) (\"***Universal Compression***\"), \u00b6 77).\n\n36.\n\nSecond, in Claimants' view, the arguments regarding the alleged relationship between the Firm and Shell put forward by the Respondent are speculative assertions that fail to satisfy the Article 57 requirement of a fact indicating a manifest lack of independence or impartiality. The Claimants further dispute Respondent's assertion that the Firm was Shell's main legal advisor, given that the Respondent has failed to offer any evidence in support of such assertion and that there were 11 firms on the panel of legal firms retained by Shell to provide advice during Mr. Rees' tenure at Shell. Furthermore, the Claimants submit that no evidence has been offered by the Respondent that Mr. Rees was personally involved in any Shell transaction in which the Firm was retained, and confirm that none of the Firm's team in this case was involved in any of the Shell transactions cited by the Respondent.23\n\nClaimants' Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.\n\n37.\n\nThird, with respect to Mr. Rees' role on the Investment Committee of HLF, the Claimants first note that the Respondent has failed to substantiate its claim that providing advice to an entity which funds arbitral disputes disqualifies an arbitrator in an unrelated dispute involving different parties. In addition, the Claimants submit that Mr. Rees was not required to disclose his relation to HLF in his declaration and statement since ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) contains no requirement for an arbitrator to disclose a professional or business relationship that has no overlap with or connection to the parties to the dispute. In any event, the Claimants consider that even if Mr. Rees' connection to HLF was relevant in this case, non-disclosure would not be sufficient for disqualification. Moreover, as to Respondent's allegations concerning Mr. Afzali, the Claimants confirm that he has never been involved in this case and consider that the Respondent has failed to show why a move by one employee from a large firm to another company means that those two companies would be closely intertwined, as the Respondent claims.24\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 33-37.\n\n38.\n\nFinally, concerning Mr. Rees' alleged pre-judgement of the issue of intra-EU investment arbitration, the Claimants argue that \"[t]he only fact that Mr Rees' declaration makes clear is that the 'intra-EU' issue was not discussed by the Investment Committee in relation to the *Rockhopper v Italy* case. Any speculation relating to the committee's lack of discussion on the matter cannot manifestly demonstrate that Mr Rees has prejudged the issue. Spain has not proved or even asserted that Mr Rees has expressed any opinion on the issue.\"25 The Claimants add that it would be no surprise that there was no discussion of the issue as all investment tribunals to date that have considered the \"intra-EU\" jurisdictional objection have rejected it. Furthermore, the Claimants point out that the Respondent itself has appointed an arbitrator in another case who had previously issued a decision on the \"intra-EU\" jurisdictional objection and, hence, the Respondent must not have considered this to constitute a manifest lack of independence or pre-judgement by the arbitrator.26\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 40.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 43.\n\n**III. MR. REES\u2019 EXPLANATIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nMr. Rees provided his explanations on 21 October 2019, together with copies of his disclosures of 20 May and 12 June 2019.\n\n40.\n\nWith respect to the first ground for disqualification, Mr. Rees noted that his disclosure of 20 May 2019 set out his previous appointments by clients of the Firm and the amounts involved in the arbitrations in question.\n\n41.\n\nConcerning the second ground for disqualification, Mr. Rees noted that: ***(1)*** he took over as Legal Director of Shell on January 2011 at which time Shell had a panel of five law firms that had been established by the former Legal Director (and included the Firm for transactional work); ***(2)*** at the time he joined, Shell had approximately 720 in-house lawyers in 40 different jurisdictions who were required to use the panel firms for the work for which those firms had been appointed on the panel; ***(3)*** he conducted a new panel selection procedure, which was completed in May 2013, that broadened the number of firms on the panel from five to more than 150 (11 firms, including the Firm, were selected as panel members for particular work in more than three jurisdictions); and ***(4)*** the Legal Director was not involved in law firm selection for particular transactions, nor was it practical for the Legal Director to do so given the high volume of contracts and pieces of legislation and arbitration in which Shell was involved.\n\n42.\n\nWith regard to the third ground for disqualification, Mr. Rees referenced his prior disclosures of 20 May and 12 June 2019 in which he had provided details of his involvement with the Company. In addition, Mr. Rees noted that he was no longer a member of HLF's Investment Committee since July 2019. Mr. Rees also confirmed that he had never met, nor had any communications with, Mr. Afzali.\n\n43.\n\nFinally, regarding the fourth ground for disqualification, Mr. Rees referenced his prior disclosure that there was no discussion at the Investment Committee in relation to the issue of an investor from an EU country making a claim against any EU State. Moreover, the decision to fund the *Rockhopper* case was taken by the Investment Committee in September 2016, while the *Achmea* decision on the issue of intra-EU investment arbitration was issued on March 2018, so it could not have been a subject of debate.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS OF THE UNCHALLENGED ARBITRATORS**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n**1. Applicable Legal Standards**\n---------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe relevant treaty for deciding on the Proposal is the ICSID Convention, and in particular Articles 57 and 14.27 The Unchallenged Arbitrators acknowledge as well the relevance of Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT when interpreting a treaty,28 which includes taking into account any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties to that treaty.29 In the context of the Proposal, however, the salient rules are to be found in the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nBoth Parties cite to the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules. *See* Proposal, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12; Claimants' Observations, \u00b6 5.\n\nSpain acceded to the VCLT on 16 May 1972. Luxembourg acceded to the VCLT on 23 May 2003. Although the VCLT applies only to treaties that are concluded by States after the entry into force of the VCLT as between those States (VCLT, Article 4), the rules set forth in Articles 31 and 32 are widely accepted as reflecting customary international law, and have been used as such repeatedly by the International Court of Justice, other international courts and tribunals, and States since the adoption of the VCLT in 1969.\n\nVCLT, Article 31(3)(c).\n\n45.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads as follows:\n\nA party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\n\n46.\n\nThe disqualification proposed in this case alleges that Mr. Rees manifestly lacks the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address disqualification \"on the ground that [an arbitrator] was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.\"30\n\nFurther, it is noted that the Claimants have not contended that the Respondent's Proposal was untimely under ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n47.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the ICSID Convention in English provides:\n\nPersons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\n\n48.\n\nFor its part, Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention in Spanish provides:\n\n*Las personas designadas para figurar en las Listas deber\u00e1n gozar de amplia consideraci\u00f3n moral, tener reconocida competencia en el campo del Derecho, del comercio, de la industria o de las finanzas e inspirar plena confianza en su imparcialidad de juicio. La competencia en el campo del Derecho ser\u00e1 circunstancia particularmente relevante para las personas designadas en la Lista de \u00c1rbitros*.\n\n49.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"independent judgment\" (and the French version to *\"toute garantie d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions\"),* the Spanish version requires \"*imparcialidad de juicio\"\"* (impartiality of judgment). Given that all three versions are equally authentic, the Unchallenged Arbitrators agree with earlier decisions that arbitrators must be both independent and impartial.31\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA. v.

As such, there is a burden to establish facts showing that the arbitrator is a person who may not be relied upon to exercise independent and impartial judgment. As for who bears that burden, \"the party challenging an arbitrator must establish facts, of a kind or character as reasonably to give rise to the inference that the person challenged clearly may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment in the particular case where the challenge is made.\"35 In this instance, that Party is the Respondent.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 25 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 27, 34.\n\n*See Suez*, \u00b6 34; *Alpha*, \u00b6 37; *Universal Compression*, \u00b6 71; *Blue Bank*, \u00b6 47; *Burlington*, \u00b6 68; *Abaclat*, \u00b6 71; *Repsol*, \u00b6 73.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

Christopher Thomas dated 19 December 2002 (Claimants' Annex 9), \u00b6 20.\n\n51.\n\nAs for what is meant by the allied concepts of \"independence\" and of \"impartiality,\" the former concept speaks principally to the absence of external control, while the latter concept relates to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a party. Both concepts seek to protect the parties from having arbitrators who are influenced by factors unrelated to the merits of the case.\n\n**2. Relationship between Disclosure and Independence/Impartiality**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) sets out the form of the declaration currently required of arbitrators who accept to serve on an ICSID tribunal. That declaration provides as follows:\n\nTo the best of my knowledge there is no reason why I should not serve on the Arbitral Tribunal constituted by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes with respect to a dispute between \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_and\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\n\nI shall keep confidential all information coming to my knowledge as a result of my participation in this proceeding, as well as the contents of any award made by the Tribunal.\n\nI shall judge fairly as between the parties, according to the applicable law, and shall not accept any instruction or compensation with regard to the proceeding from any source except as provided in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States and in the Regulations and Rules made pursuant thereto.\n\nAttached is a statement of (a) my past and present professional, business and other relationships (if any) with the parties and (b) any other circumstance that might cause my reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party. I acknowledge that by signing this declaration, I assume a continuing obligation promptly to notify the Secretary-General of the Centre of any such relationship or circumstance that subsequently arises during this proceeding.\n\n53.\n\nAs has been noted by other tribunals, there is a clear distinction between the disclosure standards of Arbitration Rule 6(2) and the disqualification standard set forth in Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention. A failure to disclose a fact that should have been disclosed is not, of itself, a sufficient reason to find a manifest lack of independence or impartiality. Rather, non-disclosure would indicate a manifest lack of such qualities \"only if the facts or circumstances surrounding such non-disclosure are of such gravity (whether alone or in combination with other factors) as to call into question the ability of the arbitrator to exercise independent and impartial judgment.\"36\n\n*Tidewater*, \u00b6 40.\n\n**3. Relevance of the IBA Guidelines**\n--------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nIn the course of their pleadings, the Parties have referred to the IBA Guidelines. While these guidelines may serve as a reference, the Unchallenged Arbitrators are bound by the standards set forth in the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, this decision is made based upon the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules.37\n\n*See Blue Bank*, \u00b6 62.\n\n**B. Nature of the Challenge Concerning Mr. Rees**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nAs indicated above, the ICSID Convention\u2019s standard for a challenge, which is found in Article 57, embodies an objective criterion that imposes the stringent requirement of a \"manifest\" lack of the three types of qualities set forth in Article 14(1) - namely the qualities of \"high moral character,\" \"recognized competence,\" and reliability to exercise independent and impartial judgment.\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent does not seek to impugn Mr. Rees\u2019 character, nor does it raise any doubt as to his legal competence. Instead, the Respondent focuses its attention on the last of the three qualifications: reliability to exercise independent or impartial judgment.\n\n**C. Ground 1: Repeated Appointments and Lack of Proper Disclosure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe first ground for disqualification asserts that Mr. Rees lacks independence or impartiality because he: (*1*) failed to disclose that he had been previously appointed by the Firm in two, multi-million-dollar cases, which the Respondent asserts are the \"most relevant Arbitration cases the Firm is running\";38 and *(**2**)* has now been appointed in three cases by the Firm.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 46; *see also ibid*., \u00b6 48 (\"economically most relevant cases\").\n\n58.\n\nAt the outset of his appointment, Mr. Rees disclosed in his Declaration and Statement dated 8 May 2019 that he had previously been appointed by clients of the Firm in two arbitral cases held under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce.39 The Respondent is correct that the 8 May 2019 disclosure did not specify the quantum in dispute for the two cases, but Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules does not require such disclosure. Rather, Arbitration Rule 6(2) provides the form of the declaration that each arbitrator must sign, which states that an arbitrator shall provide a statement of \"(a) [his/her] past and present professional, business and other relationships (if any) with the parties and (b) any other circumstance that might cause [his/her] reliability for independent judgment to be questioned by a party.\"40 Mr. Rees disclosed on 8 May 2019 the fact of his two prior appointments relating to the Firm, thereby alerting the Respondent to those two cases.\n\nMr. Peter Rees Declaration and Statement dated 8 May 2019, p. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 52.\n\n59.\n\nFurther, when the Respondent shortly thereafter queried Mr. Rees about the quantum at issue in those two cases, Mr. Rees promptly disclosed the amounts in a further Disclosure dated 20 May 2019.41 Although the Respondent asserts that these two cases are the most relevant arbitration cases that the Firm is running, the Respondent has not presented evidence to that effect,42 nor explained how the quantum at issue in those cases bears upon Mr. Rees' reliability to exercise independent or impartial judgment in this case. It is noted that Mr. Rees' 20 May 2019 disclosure indicates that one of those two cases has settled and no award was made, while the other remains ongoing.43\n\nDisclosure by the Arbitrator Appointed by the Claimants, Peter Rees, dated 20 May 2019, p. 1 (\"**Rees 20 May Disclosure\")**.\n\nAt times, the Respondent appears to seek to impose the burden in this proceeding on the Claimants. *See* Respondent's Further Comments, \u00b6 17. As indicated *supra* at \u00b6 50, however, the burden of demonstrating that there exist facts indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1) rests in this instance with the Respondent, as the proponent of the Proposal, and not with the Claimants.\n\nRees 20 May Disclosure, p. 1.\n\n60.\n\nIt is the view of the Unchallenged Arbitrators that Mr. Rees' non-disclosure in his 8 May 2019 declaration of the quantum at issue in his two previous appointments relating to the Firm does not evidence a manifest lack on his part of independence or impartiality in this case.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent's first ground for disqualification is also based on the fact that the Firm has now been involved in appointing Mr. Rees to three cases. Those appointments occurred on the following dates:\n\n- 11 March 2016 (involving the Firm's Netherlands and U.K. offices)\n\n- 12 September 2018 (involving its Australian and Hong Kong offices)\n\n- 8 May 2019 (involving its Madrid office)44\n\nFor the first two appointments, *see ibid*., pp. 1-2; for the appointment in this case, *see* Letter of 8 May 2019 from ICSID to the Parties.\n\n62.\n\nThe Unchallenged Arbitrators agree with the Respondent that multiple appointments of an arbitrator by a party or its counsel are a factor that must be carefully considered in the context of a challenge. As the unchallenged arbitrators stated in *OPIC:*\n\nIn an environment where parties have the capacity to choose arbitrators, damage to the confidence that investors and States have in the institution of investor-State dispute resolution may be adversely affected by a perception that multiple appointments of the same arbitrator by a party or its counsel arise from a relationship of familiarity and confidence inimical to the requirement of independence established by the Convention.45\n\n*OPIC*, \u00b6 47.\n\n63.\n\nAt the same time, the mere fact that an arbitrator has been appointed twice previously by a law firm in arbitral cases is not, standing alone, a basis for finding either an actual or an appearance of a manifest lack of independence or impartiality when appointed in a third case.46 No objective fact has been presented demonstrating that Mr. Rees' independence or impartiality is impacted in this case by the three appointments involving the Firm. For example, it has not been shown that Mr. Rees is in a relationship of financial dependence to the Firm based on these three appointments, nor that these cases are related in some way that would affect Mr. Rees' decision in this case.47 A relationship of familiarity and confidence between Mr. Rees and the Firm is not obvious from the fact of the three appointments, particularly given that the three cases involve different counsel from different offices of the Firm. Nor do three appointments on this time frame, standing alone, create an appearance of a manifest lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, *Caratube*, \u00b6 107 (\"Absent any other objective circumstances demonstrating that these prior appointments manifestly influence his ability to exercise independent judgment in the present arbitration, they do not on their own justify Mr. Boesch's disqualification\"); *OPIC*, \u00b6 53 (noting two prior appointments involving the same law firm, but noting that \"these two appointments by Respondent's counsel do not in our view reach the level of multiple appointments that would by themselves demonstrate the manifest lack of independence required to be established for a successful proposal to disqualify under the Convention\").\n\n*See Tidewater*, \u00b6 62.\n\n64.\n\nAlthough the IBA Guidelines are not applicable in this proceeding, it is noted that Section 3.3.8 of the IBA Guidelines' Orange List is not implicated on these facts. The Orange List \"is a non-exhaustive list of specific situations that, depending on the facts of a given case, may, in the eyes of the parties, give rise to doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence.\"48 Section 3.3.8 envisages a situation where \"[t]he arbitrator has, within the past three years, been appointed on more than three occasions by the same counsel, or the same law firm.\"49 Mr. Rees has not received more than three appointments by the Firm within the past three years; rather, as of the date of Mr. Rees' appointment in this case, there had been two such appointments (12 September 2018 and 8 May 2019).\n\nIBA Guidelines, Part II, \u00b6 3.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00a7 3.3.8.\n\n65.\n\nIn conclusion, the Unchallenged Arbitrators find that Mr. Rees properly disclosed his appointment on two prior occasions by the Firm and further disclosed the quantum at issue in those cases upon being requested. Further, the Unchallenged Arbitrators find that such appointments in conjunction with his appointment in this case do not demonstrate a manifest lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n**D. Ground 2: Past and Present Relationship with the Claimants\u2019 Counsel**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe second ground for disqualification asserts that Mr. Rees lacks independence or impartiality because of a past and present relationship with the Claimants' counsel. The principal focus of this ground concerns Mr. Rees's prior service as the Legal Director of Shell. This service appears to have been from an initial transition period that began in November 2010 (he formally became Shell's Legal Director in January 2011) and continued until April 2014.50\n\nExplanations, \u00b6 5.\n\n67.\n\nDuring that time, the Respondent identifies six times that Shell used the Firm for advice regarding mergers and acquisitions or antitrust litigation.51 While the Respondent asserts that these constituted \"the largest transactions conducted under the Challenged Arbitrator's tenure,\"52 it does not produce any evidence supporting that proposition.\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 51-56.\n\nRespondent's Further Comments, \u00b6 21.\n\n68.\n\nAt the same time, Shell apparently used multiple law firms throughout this period. According to Mr. Rees, when he arrived at Shell, there was a panel of five firms that could be used by Shell employees for particular transactions, which already included the Firm for transactional work.53 By the time Mr. Rees departed Shell, a panel of more than 150 firms could be used, which continued to include the Firm.54 Further, Shell itself employed more than 700 lawyers who were directly involved in selecting which law firms would be used for particular transactions.55 According to Mr. Rees, he was not involved in the selection of law firms for particular transactions throughout this period; it was not practical to do so, as \"Shell entered into approximately one million contracts each year involving annual capital expenditure of approximately USD 30 billion each year\" and had \"over 10,000 pieces of litigation and arbitration [at] any one time.\"56 Though the Respondent has expressed doubts in this regard,57 the Respondent has not shown that Mr. Rees was directly involved in any of the six instances that Shell used the Firm for advice during Mr. Rees' time as Shell's Legal Director.58\n\nExplanations, \u00b6 6.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 9.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 7.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 8.\n\nRespondent's Further Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\nRespondent points to a document produced by the Claimants in which Mr. Rees is quoted in relation to Shell's expansion in 2013 of its panel of firms. *Ibid.*, \u00b6 19. That document, however, does not indicate that Mr. Rees personally was involved in the selection of any firm for a particular transaction; references to \"we\" appear to refer to Shell as an entity (Claimants' Annex 20).\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Claimants' Observations of 18 October 2019 in opposition to the Proposal constitutes such a \"passionate defense\" by the Firm that it raises serious doubt about the impartiality and independence of Mr. Rees.59 The Unchallenged Arbitrators do not regard the Claimants' Observations as outside the bounds of normal advocacy on behalf of a client, in this instance engaging on the Respondent's grounds for disqualification by raising relevant points of fact and law. Nor do the Unchallenged Arbitrators view Mr. Rees' Explanations of 21 October 2019 as making any inappropriate reference to those Observations.60\n\nRespondent's Further Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\n*See ibid*., \u00b6 7.\n\n70.\n\nIn light of the above, the Unchallenged Arbitrators do not find it has been proved that Mr. Rees' position as Legal Director at Shell created an intertwined relationship between him and the Firm that now manifestly calls into question Mr. Rees' ability to act independently or impartially in this case.\n\n**E. Ground 3: Relationship with a Third-Party Litigation Fund**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe third ground for disqualification asserts that Mr. Rees lacks independence or impartiality because at the time of his appointment in this case: ***(1)*** Mr. Rees was serving on the investment committee of a third-party litigation fund, HLF;61***(2)*** he failed to disclose that role in his Declaration and Statement at the outset of this case;62***(3)*** HLF had funded a claimant that was represented by the Firm;63 and ***(4)*** HLF had hired an individual from the Hong Kong office of the Firm.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 63; Respondent's Further Comments, \u00b6 23.\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62; Respondent's Further Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\nRespondent's Further Comments, \u00b6 13.\n\n72.\n\nTaking the issue of disclosure first, the Respondent is correct that Mr. Rees did not disclose in his Declaration and Statement dated 8 May 2019 that he had been serving since February 2015 on HLF's Investment Committee. When the Respondent shortly thereafter queried Mr. Rees about his role with HLF, Mr. Rees disclosed the specifics of that role in his Disclosure dated 20 May 2019.64 Further, Mr. Rees stepped down as a member of HLF's Investment Committee in July 2019 and no longer has any involvement with that company.65\n\nRees 20 May Disclosure, p. 2.\n\nExplanations, \u00b6 12.\n\n73.\n\nIt is the view of the Unchallenged Arbitrators that Mr. Rees should have disclosed his connection with HLF as a part of his Declaration and Statement dated 8 May 2019. This third-party litigation fund appears to be actively involved in funding investor-State disputes, which is a circumstance that might cause Mr. Rees' reliability for independent judgment or impartiality to be questioned by a party. If Mr. Rees had advised for or against the pursuit of one or more investor-State claims, such advice might well be pertinent as to his views as an arbitrator in a dispute that involves similar or identical issues of law or fact. Rather than learn of Mr. Rees' connection to HLF through disclosure, the Respondent on its own had to discover such information, leading it to pursue further, valid questions as to the nature of the cases for which Mr. Rees provided advice.\n\n74.\n\nA failure to disclose a relevant fact, however, does not by itself demonstrate a manifest lack of impartiality or independence.66 Rather, the purpose of disclosure is to inform the parties of a situation that they may wish to explore further in order to determine whether there are justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator\u2019s independence or impartiality.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 53.\n\n75.\n\nIn this instance, the initial failure to disclose such information is not of sufficient gravity to merit disqualification. Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules does not expressly require disclosure of an arbitrator\u2019s connection with a third-party litigation fund, such that it is difficult to conclude that Mr. Rees affirmatively sought to conceal such information from either Party. Further, the Respondent identified the relevant information within a matter of days after Mr. Rees\u2019 8 May 2019 Declaration and Statement, allowing it to pursue the matter through further appropriate queries. Mr. Rees then confirmed and explained his connection with HLF in his Declaration dated 20 May 2019. As such, the failure of Mr. Rees to disclose this information in his initial Declaration and Statement does not, standing alone, indicate a manifest lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the simple fact that Mr. Rees was a member of HLF\u2019s Investment Committee at the time of his appointment is *per se* a basis for finding a manifest lack of independence or impartiality. According to the Respondent, an \"impartial and independent arbitrator cannot, under one hat, [advise] and encourage litigation on disputes, and, under another hat, adjudicate on those same disputes.\"67 The Unchallenged Arbitrators agree that such \"dual hatting\" is problematic if, in context, there is a specific connection of some kind between the person\u2019s role as an adviser and the person\u2019s role as an arbitrator. For example, providing advice on the merits of a specific claim and then sitting as an arbitrator concerning that same claim (or a similar claim) would be a basis for finding a manifest lack of independence or impartiality. The Respondent\u2019s Ground 4, which is discussed below, advances such an argument. But a person\u2019s involvement in a third-party litigation fund, standing alone and in light of the current rules, does not demonstrate a manifest lack of independence or impartiality of that person as an arbitrator for all ICSID cases. Moreover, it is recalled that, as of July 2019, Mr. Rees no longer has any involvement with HLF.\n\nRespondent's Further Comments, \u00b6 23.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that, because HLF has funded a claim where the claimant is represented by the Firm, this too shows that there is a close connection between Mr. Rees and the Firm, thereby demonstrating that Mr. Rees lacks independence and impartiality. In his Declaration of 20 May 2019, Mr. Rees stated that HLF funded a claim for fraud in U.K. courts, and that the Firm represented the claimant in the U.K. case. According to Mr. Rees, the U.K. case commenced in 2013 and the decision by HLF to fund the case was taken before Mr. Rees joined HLF's Investment Committee.68 Under these circumstances, the Unchallenged Arbitrators do not see any significant connection between HLF's funding of such a claim and Mr. Rees, so as to demonstrate any manifest lack of independence or impartiality on the part of Mr. Rees in this case.\n\nRees 20 May Disclosure, pp. 2-3.\n\n78.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the hiring by HLF of Mr. Afzali from the Firm (its Hong Kong office), further demonstrates a disqualifying connection between Mr. Rees and the Firm. In its Proposal, the Respondent asserts that Mr. Afzali \"maintains contacts with the Firm and with the Challenged Arbitrator...\",69 but does not identify any specifics in that regard. Mr. Rees, however, indicates that he has \"never met Mr Afzali nor, to the best of [his] recollection, had any communications with him.\"70 The Firm indicated that \"Mr Afzali has never been involved in this case.\"71 After considering these facts, the Unchallenged Arbitrators do not see the hiring of Mr. Afzali by HLF as demonstrating any manifest lack of independence or impartiality on the part of Mr. Rees in this case.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 64.\n\nExplanations, \u00b6 13.\n\nClaimants' Observations, \u00b6 37.\n\n**F. Ground 4: Pre-judgment of a Matter at Issue in this Case**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe fourth ground for disqualification asserts that Mr. Rees lacks independence or impartiality because in September 2016, during the time that he served on the Investment Committee of HLF, he was part of a decision to fund the *Rockhopper* case.72 According to the Respondent, the decision to invest in that claim necessarily meant that Mr. Rees considered and rejected the possibility that there could be a jurisdictional objection to intra-EU investment arbitration. As such, the Respondent argues that Mr. Rees \"had a clear idea that the intra-EU objection was meritless,\"73 and thus has prejudged an issue that will arise in this case.74\n\n*Rockhopper Italia S.P.A., Rockhopper Mediterranean Ltd, and Rockhopper Exploration Plc v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/17/14, Decision on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection dated 26 June 2019 (Claimants' Annex 21).\n\nProposal, \u00b6 68.\n\nRespondent's Further Comments, \u00b6 35.\n\n80.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent\u2019s position rests on mere speculation as to Mr. Rees\u2019 state of mind in 2016. Further, the Claimants question the inference that the Respondent seeks to make by noting that the Respondent itself has acted in a manner that appears inconsistent with the logic it now invokes.75\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 38.\n\n81.\n\nIn a Further Disclosure of 12 June 2019, Mr. Rees stated \"that there was no discussion at the Investment Committee in relation to the issue of an investor from an EU country making a claim against an EU state.\"76 Moreover, in his Explanations of 21 October 2019, he reiterates that when HLF\u2019s Investment Committee decided to invest in the *Rockhopper* claim in September 2016, \"there was no discussion at the Investment Committee in relation to the issue of an investor from an EU country making a claim against an EU state. The *Achmea* decision was not given by the ECJ until March 2018, so it could not have been a subject of debate.\"77 The Respondent, however, maintains that the potential impermissibility of intra-EU investment arbitration had been raised by the European Commission and debated in academic circles in 2015-2016, such that the validity of a jurisdictional objection to intra-EU investment arbitration must have been a factor in the Investment Committee\u2019s decision, even before issuance of the *Achmea* decision.\n\nFurther Disclosure by the Arbitrator Appointed by the Claimants, Peter Rees QC, dated 12 June 2019, p. 1.\n\nExplanations, \u00b6 14.\n\n82.\n\nThe Respondent has not identified any specific, clear opinion rendered by Mr. Rees as to the validity or invalidity of a jurisdictional objection to intra-EU investment arbitration.78 Rather, this ground for disqualification is based on a conjecture as to what Mr. Rees\u2019 must have believed as of September 2016. The Unchallenged Arbitrators acknowledge the Respondent\u2019s general point that, in the period before the issuance of the *Achmea* decision, there was some debate about the permissibility of intra-EU investment arbitration.79 Yet there is always debate of one kind or another, at least in academic circles, about many possible decisions that courts or tribunals might reach in the future. It is not obvious, however, that such *pre-Achmea* debate would inescapably lead to an analysis in September 2016 of the issue by the Investment Committee upon which Mr. Rees served. As such, it is too speculative to assume that Mr. Rees must have previously considered and rejected the validity of a jurisdictional objection to intra-EU investment arbitration.\n\n*See Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Decision on Claimants' Proposal to Disqualify Professor Campbell McLachlan, Arbitrator (Claimants' Annex 22), \u00b6 44 (\"What matters is whether the opinions expressed by [the arbitrator]... are specific and clear enough that a reasonable and informed third party would find that the arbitrator will rely on such opinions without giving proper consideration to the facts, circumstances, and arguments presented by the Parties in this proceeding.\").\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes the European Commission's view in 2015 with respect to the *Micula* case. Respondent's Further Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32. Yet, that view may not be directly on point. In 2015, the European Commission decided that Romania's payment of the \u20ac178 million *Micula* award, which was rendered by an ICSID tribunal in 2013, would constitute illegal State aid within the meaning of Article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Specifically, the issue was whether the reinstating of privileges that had been abolished by Romania in the course of its accession to the European Union (or compensating the investors for the loss of these privileges) would lead to the granting of new aid incompatible with EU State aid rules. Such a view might not be regarded as pertinent in the context of the *Rockhopper* claim (it is noted that on 18 June 2019, the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union overturned the European Commission's 2015 decision, finding that (1) the *Micula* award recognized a right to compensation for the investors existing before Romania's accession to the EU; and (2) the Commission was precluded from applying EU State aid rules to this situation, at least with respect to the pre-accession period.).\n\n83.\n\nBased on these facts, the Unchallenged Arbitrators do not find that Mr. Rees' involvement in the decision to fund the *Rockhopper* case in September 2016 demonstrates his manifest inability to act independently or impartially in this case.\n\n**G. Viewing the Disqualification Grounds Collectively**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent has asked that the Unchallenged Arbitrators view the various grounds for disqualification \"as a unity,\" rather than as just individual components.80 According to the Respondent, Mr. Rees maintains \"a very close relationship\" with the Firm, a relationship that has \"strong and old roots,\" to include his repeated appointment as an arbitrator and the links between the Firm and the litigation fund for which Mr. Rees worked.81\n\n*See* Proposal, \u00b6\u00b6 44, 75; Respondent's Further Comments, \u00b6 4.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 5.\n\n85.\n\nThe Unchallenged Arbitrators have considered the totality of the points raised by the Respondent, so as to consider whether, collectively, they demonstrate a manifest lack of independence or impartiality on the part of Mr. Rees in this case. After careful consideration, the Unchallenged Arbitrators do not view such points as establishing a particular relationship of Mr. Rees to the Firm that demonstrates a manifest lack of independence, nor as establishing that Mr. Rees has a particular bias or predisposition, so as to merit disqualification. Nor do such points considered collectively establish an appearance of a manifest lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n86.\n\nHaving considered all the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the Parties, and for the reasons stated above, the Unchallenged Arbitrators reject the Respondent\u2019s Proposal to disqualify Mr. Rees.\n\n87.\n\nThe costs of this challenge proceeding are reserved."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2020-08-28T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on Bifurcation)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

THE PARTIES' POSITIONS ON BIFURCATION**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nIn its Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent raises seven preliminary objections. The Tribunal's allegedly lacks jurisdiction: **(a)** because the Claimants did not invest in Spain within the meaning of the Energy Charter Treaty (\"**ECT**\"); **(b)** because the true Claimants are of Spanish nationality and thus not protected under the ECT; **(c)** due to the Claimants' abuse of process; **(d)** due to the Respondent's denial of benefits to the Claimants under Article 17 of the ECT; **(e)** due to the \"intra-EU\" nature of the dispute; **(f)** due to the failure to fulfil the pre-requisites for arbitration set forth in Article 26 of the ECT; and **(g)** due to the lack of consent to arbitration of tax measures, including the Tax on the Value of Production of Electrical Energy (\"**TVPEE**\") established by Act 15/2012 of 27 December 2012 on Tax Measures for Energy Sustainability (\"**Act 15/2012**\"). These objections are summarized in section 1 below.\n\n8.\n\nIn putting forward its arguments, and as summarized in section 2 below, the Respondent proceeds on the basis that its objections are not frivolous, are not intertwined with the merits, and, if successful, would dispose of the claims or an essential part of the claims.1\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 528-541.\n\n**1. The Respondent's Objections**\n----------------------------------\n\n**a. Lack of Jurisdiction because the Claimants Did Not Invest in Spain**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the dispute because the Claimants have failed to prove that they made an \"investment\" protected under Article 1(6) of the ECT.2 The Respondent's arguments in this regard are three-fold.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 12-15, 142-211.\n\n10.\n\n*First*, the Respondent states that the Claimants allege to have invested through a share purchase agreement signed on 4 August 2011 (\"**SPA**\"). However, Canepa Green Energy Opportunities I, S.\u00e1 r.l. (\"**Canepa I**\") and Canepa Green Energy Opportunities II, S.\u00e1 r.l. (\"**Canepa II**\") were not constituted until November and December 2011, respectively. Accordingly, the Claimants did not exist at the time when they claim to have made their investment and, therefore, they could not have made it.3\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 13, 36, 41, 47-48, 56, 153-158, 207.\n\n11.\n\n*Second*, the Respondent claims that the limited evidence provided by the Claimants shows that they did not make any contribution to the amount alleged as investment; rather, the funds at issue originated from the Claimants' shareholders. As a result, Canepa I and Canepa II did not undertake any risk. Therefore, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have not made any investments in an objective sense.4\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 14, 159-188, 208-209.\n\n12.\n\n*Finally*, based on the expert report attached to its Request for Bifurcation concerning the Claimants' shareholding structure, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants do not directly or indirectly control the assets related to this arbitration. Therefore, the assets at issue do not qualify as \"investments\" under Article 1(6) of the ECT.5\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 15, 36, 189-205, 210-211.\n\n**b. Lack of Jurisdiction because the True Claimants Are of Spanish Nationality**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent claims that piercing the corporate veil of the Claimants shows that it is actually a group of Spanish companies formed by Azora Capital, S.L. and other entities (\"**Azora**\") that has made the relevant investment in this case. Therefore, the Claimants do not meet the jurisdictional requirement set out in Article 26(1) of the ECT, which requires investors to be nationals \"of another Contracting Party\" (i.e., other than Spain).6\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 16-17, 212-237.\n\n14.\n\nBased on the documentation provided by the Claimants with their Memorial, the Respondent provides a chronological account of the investment process in this case which, in its view, proves that \"the investment was negotiated, agreed, executed and controlled from Spain, by people and entities linked to the Spanish group Azora.\"7\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 60 *; see also ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 61-141, 215, 234.\n\n15.\n\nFor instance, according to the Respondent, the public deed of Canepa Green Energy Espa\u00f1a S.L. (\"**Canepa Espa\u00f1a**\"), a party to the SPA entered into to acquire the Spanish entities that own the wind power-generation installations at issue in this arbitration (\"**wind parks**\"), shows that Canepa Espa\u00f1a's registered office is that of Azora and Canepa Espa\u00f1a's chairman of the board of directors is also Azora's administrator. The Respondent argues that this evidences Azora's control over Canepa Espa\u00f1a.8\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 44-46, 216.\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is a technique that has been applied by international tribunals on many occasions. It is justified in this case to prevent a Spanish company from filing a claim against Spain under the dispute resolution mechanism that is exclusively provided for foreign investors under the ECT.9\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 222-226, 236.\n\n**c. Lack of Jurisdiction Due to Claimants' Abuse of Process**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent claims that Canepa I and Canepa II were established in Luxembourg with the sole purpose of resorting to arbitration against Spain under the ECT, which is tantamount to an abuse of process and contrary to the principle of good faith.10\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 18-19, 238-355.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants are \"two shell companies lacking any business activity\"11 that were created through subscription to capital increases in Spanish companies \"when the investment had already been agreed (in August 2011), without personnel or resources, and once the dispute was absolutely foreseeable.\"12 The Claimants' incorporation for the mere purpose of filing an arbitration claim under Article 26 of the ECT against Spain therefore represents \"a typical case of abuse of process and prohibited Forum Shopping.\"13 Such an abuse of process, which is in violation of international law,14 should lead the Tribunal to declare a lack of jurisdiction.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 234 *; see ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 272-314.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 239; *see ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 315-350.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 264.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 246-263.\n\n**d. Lack of Jurisdiction Due to ECT Article 17**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent claims that, pursuant to Article 17 of the ECT, it is entitled to deny the benefits of the ECT to the Claimants and did, in fact, properly deny such benefits on 10 July 2020, in its Request for Bifurcation. This denial of benefits was made on the basis that the Claimants are purportedly owned and controlled by investors of a non-Party to the ECT (i.e.*,* not by Luxembourg nationals), and do not have substantial business activities in Luxembourg.15\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 20, 356-405.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that it has exercised its right to deny the advantages of Part III of the ECT to the Claimants in a timely and appropriate manner based on the following: **(a)** the ECT does not establish a time limit concerning the exercise of this right; and **(b)** it was only upon the review of the documentation provided by the Claimants with their Memorial that the Respondent was able to realize that they are shell companies owned by entities that are constituted in countries that are not Contracting Parties to the ECT.16\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 20, 363, 391.\n\n**e. Lack of Jurisdiction over an Intra-European Union Dispute**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ECT over disputes between a national of the European Union (\"**EU**\") and an EU member State.17\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 21, 406-459.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the EU is a Contracting Party to the ECT and, if the Claimants are nationals of an EU member State, then (vis-\u00e0-vis Spain) they do not originate from \"another Contracting Party\" as required under Article 26 of the ECT.18 Further, the Respondent submits that the autonomy and the primacy of EU law, which require that intra-EU investment disputes be resolved solely within the EU legal system, are applicable as a matter of customary international law,19 treaty law,20 and general principles of law.21 Among other things, the Respondent argues that the express wording, purpose and context of the ECT leads to the conclusion that EU Member States did not consent to the arbitration of intra-EU disputes under Article 26 of the ECT.22 Further, to the extent that there exists any conflict between the ECT and EU law, the latter should still prevail according to the proper application of Articles 30 and 59 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, thereby leading to a dismissal of this case.23 The Respondent sees as pertinent the March 2018 judgment of the Court of the European Union in the *Achmea* case,24 as well as the declaration adopted by certain EU Member States in January 2019 on the interpretation to be given to Article 26 of the ECT.25\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 21.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 420-434.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 435-454.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 455-459.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 436.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 437-452.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 445-446.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 447-448.\n\n**f. Lack of Jurisdiction Due to Failure to Fulfil Arbitration Pre-requisites**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants failed to comply with two of the conditions precedent set out in Article 26 of the ECT, which are necessary to submit the dispute to arbitration. The Respondent claims that **(a)** the Claimants did not properly notify Spain of a dispute (ECT Article 26(1)); and **(b)** the Claimants did not comply with the mandatory three-month cooling-off period to engage in a good-faith attempt to seek an amicable settlement with respect to their claims (ECT Article 26(2)).26\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 22, 460-473.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants' notice of dispute is invalid and should be considered as legally non-existent because it was submitted in English, not in Spanish, which is the only official language recognised in Spain.27 Because the Claimants did not properly submit their notification of dispute to the Respondent, they failed to attempt to settle the dispute amicably as required by Article 26(2) of the ECT.28\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 465-467, 470.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 472-473.\n\n**g. Lack of Jurisdiction over Tax Measures**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nFinally, the Respondent claims that, pursuant to the exception for tax measures contained in Article 21 of the ECT, it has not consented to the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear alleged breaches of ECT Article 10(1) related to the TVPEE, a 7% tax on the value of energy production that was imposed in Act 15/2012.29\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 23-24, 474-519.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent argues that: **(a)** Article 21 of the ECT establishes that the ECT does not generate obligations or rights with respect to taxation measures of the Contracting Parties, with certain exceptions not applicable here; **(b)** Article 10(1) of the ECT, on which the Claimants attempt to base their claims, does not create obligations for the Contracting Parties relating to taxation measures; **(c)** the TVPEE is a taxation measure; and, accordingly, **(d)** the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear alleged breaches of Article 10(1) of the ECT related to the TVPEE.30\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 479, 518.\n\n**2. Appropriateness of Bifurcation in this Case**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Tribunal's power to analyse jurisdictional issues as preliminary questions is derived from Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.31 Moreover, bifurcation is a standard procedure in the context of ICSID arbitration.32\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 520-521.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 522.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent identifies a so-called \"triple test\" that has been applied by previous arbitral tribunals when examining if a proceeding should be bifurcated and alleges that such test is met in this case, as indicated below.33 In this regard, the Respondent points to *Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States of America*, which considered: **(a)** \"whether the objection is substantial in as much as the preliminary consideration of a frivolous objection to jurisdiction is very unlikely to reduce the costs of, or time required for, the proceeding\"; **(b)** whether the objection if granted \"results in a material reduction of the proceedings at the next phase\"; and **(c)** whether the objection is \"so intertwined with the merits that it is very unlikely that there will be any savings in time or cost.\"34\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 524-527.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 525.\n\n29.\n\n*First*, the Respondent states that none of its objections are frivolous. On the contrary, they are based on the provisions of the ECT, other applicable provisions of international law, and a review of documentation from the record of the case.35\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 528-536.\n\n30.\n\n*Second*, in view of the complexity of this case, bifurcation would be consistent with the principles of procedural economy and efficiency. Bifurcating the jurisdictional and the merits phases would save considerable time, costs and human resources. It may put an end to the arbitration proceedings or substantially reduce their material scope. Should the Tribunal uphold the Respondent's jurisdictional objections without bifurcation, this would render the merits phase futile and would prove highly inefficient for the Tribunal and the Parties.36\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 537-540.\n\n31.\n\n*Finally*, the Respondent submits that its objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction are not linked to the merits of the case \"since their validity is assessed by reading the Memorial on the Merits and the documents substantiating the Claimants' alleged investment.\"37\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 541.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants request the Tribunal to dismiss the Request for Bifurcation. The Claimants emphasize that the Respondent has not met its burden of proof and that the application of the relevant standard requires that the objections be joined to the merits.38\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 44.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants' observations with respect to each of the Respondent's objections are summarized in section 1 below. The Claimants' position on the applicable legal standard and a brief summary of the reasons why they consider that bifurcation is not appropriate in this case are included in section 2 below.\n\n**1. The Claimants' Observations on the Respondent's Objections**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Lack of Jurisdiction because the Claimants Did Not Invest in Spain**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the Respondent's assertions that Canepa I and Canepa II: **(a)** were not constituted at the time the investment vehicles entered into the SPA to acquire the wind parks; **(b)** have not made an investment within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT because they purchased shares in the investment vehicles through an increase of capital and with money derived from a loan; and **(c)** have no control or possession over the investment because they are not the ultimate owners of the wind parks.\n\n35.\n\n*First*, the Claimants allege that their ownership of the wind parks at issue is not disputed; the two Claimants each own a majority of shares in two Spanish entities, which in turn own the wind parks.39 Moreover, the fact that the SPA was entered into on 4 August 2011 does not mean that the Claimants did not make an \"investment\" under Article 1(6) of the ECT. The SPA simply contemplated that various steps would occur before the acquisition was completed, including the incorporation of the Claimants in November/December 2011, after which they acquired their shares in the two Spanish entities.40\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 53.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 54-55.\n\n36.\n\n*Second*, the Claimants assert that they have made substantial investments in the wind power-generation sector in Spain within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT, in the form of shareholding and debt interests in investment vehicles (that in turn own the wind parks), claims to money, returns, and rights conferred by law. The Claimants' investments involved a contribution of economic resources (i.e., a EUR 26 million payment for shares in investment vehicles) that were intended to be a long-term investment. Moreover, there is no requirement in the ECT that an investor assume risk, nor with respect to the origin of the capital used to make an investment.41\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 49, 56-65.\n\n37.\n\n*Third*, the Claimants argue that whether the Claimants are the ultimate owners of the wind parks is irrelevant for determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction, given that the ECT does not require that an investor be the ultimate or beneficial owner of an investment.42\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 66-72.\n\n38.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that this objection does not warrant bifurcation since it is frivolous and includes allegations by the Respondent which are intertwined with the merits of the dispute, such as facts concerning how and when the investment was concluded.43\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 46, 73-74.\n\n**b. Lack of Jurisdiction because the True Claimants Are of Spanish Nationality**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's objection that lifting the corporate veil would show that the actual investor in this dispute is Azora, a Spanish entity, and not the Claimants.44\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 75-85.\n\n40.\n\n*First*, among the reasons to consider this objection as frivolous, the Claimants mention that neither Article 1(7) of the ECT nor Article 25(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention require or allow the Tribunal to pierce a company's corporate veil when ruling on jurisdiction, and previous tribunals have held that the corporate veil should not be pierced except in exceptional circumstances such as fraud, which is inapposite in this case.45\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 77-83.\n\n41.\n\n*Second*, in any event, a determination as to the nature of Azora's activities in relation to the Claimants' investments would require an analysis inextricably linked to the merits of the case. Thus, it would be inappropriate to deal with this issue by way of bifurcation.46\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 84-85.\n\n**c. Lack of Jurisdiction Due to Claimants' Abuse of Process**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's allegation that Canepa I and Canepa II were incorporated for the sole purpose of gaining access to international arbitration.\n\n43.\n\n*First*, the Claimants submit that the intention for the investment to be made by means of Luxembourg investors was envisaged from the outset of the planning in mid-2011, \"and there can be no serious suggestion that this was carried out in bad faith as a form of abusive forum shopping (nor is there any evidence of this).\"47\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 43, 89-93.\n\n44.\n\n*Second*, the Claimants argue that the disputed measures were not foreseeable at the time of their investment, as several prior arbitral tribunals have confirmed.48\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 94-97.\n\n45.\n\n*Finally*, the Claimants argue that this objection does not warrant bifurcation because it is intertwined with the merits of the case. In particular, the Respondent's allegations overlap with the assessment of the Claimants' legitimate expectations when making the investment, which requires an understanding of the merits of the Claimants' case.49\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 98-102.\n\n**d. Lack of Jurisdiction Due to ECT Article 17**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's allegation that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because, pursuant to Article 17(1) of the ECT, Spain has denied the Claimants the advantages of Part III of the ECT. The Claimants submit that this objection is insufficient to warrant bifurcation for two main reasons.50\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 103-120.\n\n47.\n\n*First*, the denial of benefits clause has no relevance to the Tribunal's jurisdiction: it only applies to the substantive provisions under Part III of the ECT and not to the Contracting State's offer to submit disputes to arbitration.51\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 106-109.\n\n48.\n\n*Second*, in any event, the denial of benefits clause **(a)** does not operate automatically and the host State (i.e., Spain) must affirmatively exercise its right to deny those benefits to the Claimants; and **(b)** must be invoked before the institution of an arbitral proceeding in order to apply to the Claimants. In addition, the Claimants mention that no ECT tribunal has ever found there to be a valid denial of benefits clause with retroactive effect.52\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 110-120.\n\n**e. Lack of Jurisdiction over an Intra-European Union Dispute**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's \"intra-EU\" objection is frivolous and does not warrant bifurcation.53\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 43, 121-132.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimants submit that there is no \"disconnection clause\" in the ECT that could have the effect of limiting either the EU's or its Member States' consent to arbitration under ECT Article 26. In the absence of such a clause, there is no doubt that the ECT applies to intra-EU disputes.54\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 123-125.\n\n51.\n\nFurther, the Claimants assert that in \"total, 35 separate ECT tribunals have faced the Intra-EU Objection and each of those tribunals has rejected it.\"55 The Claimants indicate a series of reasons why other tribunals have rejected this objection, explain that the *Achmea* judgment is not relevant to disputes arising under the ECT, and regard the declaration by the certain EU Member States in January 2019 as likewise irrelevant, for several reasons.56\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 122.\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 126-132.\n\n**f. Lack of Jurisdiction Due to Failure to Fulfil Arbitration Pre-requisites**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimants refute the Respondent's assertions that they failed to properly notify Spain of the dispute, and, consequently, failed to attempt amicable settlement of the dispute, as required by Article 26 of the ECT prior to commencing arbitration. In the Claimants' view, this objection is frivolous and does not warrant bifurcation.\n\n53.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants submit that: **(a)** there is no requirement in the ECT that a letter notifying of a dispute be sent in the official language of the host State; **(b)** Spain itself responded in English to the Claimants' letter, and subsequently met with the Claimants' representatives in the period between the notice letter and the Request for Arbitration; and, in any event **(c)** such objection goes to the admissibility of the claims and not to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.57\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 6, 133-151.\n\n**g. Lack of Jurisdiction over Tax Measures**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nFinally, the Claimants address Spain's objection that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear the Claimants' claims relating to the TVPEE because it constitutes a \"taxation measure\" within the meaning of Article 21(7) of the ECT.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal should not bifurcate based on this objection for two main reasons: **(a)** the TVPEE constitutes only one of eight disputed measures in this case and, therefore, a ruling concerning this measure would not be dispositive of all or a large portion of the case; and **(b)** this objection is closely tied to the merits of the dispute, as it will require an assessment of the regulatory measures giving rise to the Claimants' claims.58\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 42, 152-161.\n\n**2. Inappropriateness of Bifurcation in this Case**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nIn addressing why the standard has not been met for bifurcation, the Claimants initially submit that, in the ICSID context, there is no presumption in favour of bifurcation and, further, that Spain bears the burden of demonstrating that granting its request would be procedurally efficient and in the interest of fairness.59\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 13-16.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that the Tribunal has broad discretion with respect to procedure for deciding jurisdictional objections, and that the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules are silent on the test to be applied to a request for bifurcation. In addition, the Claimants agree on the \"triple test\" proposed by the Respondent, albeit the Claimants put forward that the overriding principle is that bifurcation should only proceed if it would improve the procedural efficiency of the arbitration. Moreover, the Claimants submit that the three factors applicable to determine whether bifurcation is appropriate are cumulative (i.e., the objections must be substantial in the sense of being non-frivolous; must result in a material reduction of the disputed issues or the termination of the case if upheld; *and* must not be inextricably intertwined with the merits).60\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, 17-18, 20-23.\n\n58.\n\n*First*, whether or not the objection is substantial (or non-frivolous) relates to the objection's prospect of success and is of primary importance in weighing up procedural efficiency. In this case, Spain must show both that its objections have a real prospect of success and that bifurcation will result in procedural efficiency.61\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 24-29.\n\n59.\n\n*Second*, the Tribunal must consider whether the objections, if successful, will result in a material reduction in the length or costs of the proceeding, including at the merits phase of the dispute.62\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n\n60.\n\n*Third*, the jurisdictional objections must not be inextricably linked to the merits. Therefore, bifurcation should be declined when doing so would prejudge any subsequent decision or would lead the parties to repeat material submissions in the various stages of the proceedings.63\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6\u00b6* 32-35.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Spain, for each objection, has failed to explain why, if successful, bifurcation would be conducive to procedural economy. Also, some of the objections (regarding denial of benefits and cooling-off period) are outside the scope of the Tribunal's power to bifurcate as they do not relate to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.64\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 38.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimants submit that bifurcation is not justified in this case given that all of the Respondent's objections are frivolous, would not materially reduce the scope of the merits phase, are intertwined with the merits, and/or are non-jurisdictional in nature. In addition, if bifurcation is granted and a subsequent decision on jurisdiction were not to dispose of the entirety of the case, the Claimants' case on the merits would likely not be heard until, at least, the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022. This would result in \"a vast delay that will bring with it unnecessary costs to the Claimants.\"65\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6* 9.\n\n63.\n\nBased on the above, the Claimants request the Tribunal to dismiss the Request for Bifurcation.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nWhile the following does not reference all aspects of the arguments advanced by the Parties, the Tribunal has fully considered those arguments in reaching its decision. Further, at this stage in the proceedings, this decision is necessarily based on a preliminary review of the claims and the objections to jurisdiction. Consequently, this decision does not reflect the Tribunal's views on the merits of those objections, nor on the merits of the underlying dispute, but only on whether the proceedings in this case should be bifurcated.\n\n65.\n\nThe decision to bifurcate the proceedings is a matter for the Tribunal's discretion under the ICSID Convention and the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules. Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nAny objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\n\n66.\n\nIn addition, ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4) stipulates that the Tribunal \"may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute.\" Notably, unlike some other tribunals such as the International Court of Justice, where proceedings on the merits are suspended upon receipt of preliminary objections,66 no such action is mandated by the ICSID Convention or the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The ICSID Arbitration Rules prior to 2004 did provide for such suspension,67 but that provision was dropped in the amendments adopted in 2004. As such, there is no presumption in favour of bifurcation in ICSID proceedings. Further, the Respondent, as the requesting Party on this issue, bears the burden of demonstrating that the facts currently in the record merit a conclusion by the Tribunal that bifurcation is merited.\n\nInternational Court of Justice, Rules of Court, Article 79 *bis* (3).\n\nICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (1984), Rule 41(3) (\"Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the proceeding on the merits shall be suspended.\").\n\n67.\n\nThe Parties are essentially in agreement on the relevant factors that should be considered in determining whether to bifurcate proceedings, with both Parties citing to *Glamis Gold v. United States* and other decisions.68 While the Respondent correctly notes that *Glamis Gold* was decided in the context of an UNCITRAL arbitration, the Tribunal finds (and both Parties agree69) that the three factors identified in that decision essentially have been imported into the ICSID context by many ICSID tribunals. Those factors are: **(a)** whether the objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial; **(b)** whether the objection is not intertwined with the merits; and **(c)** whether the objection is capable, if successful, of disposing of the claims or an essential part of the claims.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 523-26; Observations on Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 17-35.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 526; Observations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 21.\n\n68.\n\nThe analysis of a bifurcation request is rarely blessed with absolute certainty as to whether bifurcation would be procedurally fair and efficient. The Tribunal is principally weighing the fairness to the Claimants in not unnecessarily prolonging the proceedings (with the attendant costs) as against the efficiencies that might be gained by disposing of all or large parts of the case at a preliminary stage. Having carefully considered the submissions of the Parties, the majority of the Tribunal concludes that the three factors indicated above weigh in favour of not addressing the Respondent's jurisdictional objections at a preliminary stage.\n\n**A. Lack of Jurisdiction because the Claimants Did Not Invest in Spain**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the manner in which the investments were structured \u2013 the conclusion of the SPA on 4 August 2011, the economic contribution of the Claimants, and the degree of risk assumed by the Claimants \u2013 preclude regarding the Claimants as having \"invested\" in Spain within the meaning of the ECT and the ICSID Convention. Further, the Respondent maintains that the Claimants do not have indirect control or possession of any such investments because the Claimants are not the ultimate owners of those investments. As such, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims.\n\n70.\n\nRespondent has advanced its position while, at the same time, indicating that \"the determination of who the investor is, how the investment is prepared and negotiated, and how the investment is undertaken, is riddled with vague and imprecise statements.\"70 The Tribunal majority regards that position as somewhat diminishing the force of the Respondent's position, in that the Respondent bears the burden of demonstrating that its objections are *prima facie* serious and substantial, a burden carried not by indicating that the facts are unclear, but by showing that the facts are unlikely to support the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, *\u00b6* 35.\n\n71.\n\nOn the facts before it, the Tribunal majority does not see the conclusion of the SPA in August 2011 as calling into question the existence of an \"investment\" in this case. It appears that the Spanish entities Los Valles de Retuerta (which later changed its name to Canepa Espa\u00f1a) and Herome Inversiones 2011 (\"**Herome**\") entered into the August 2011 SPA to acquire the Spanish entities that own the wind parks at issue in this case.71 This agreement appears to constitute one of a sequence of steps, notably including: the incorporation of the Claimants on 11 November 2011 (Canepa I) and 8 December 2011 (Canepa II); the acquisition on 12 December 2011 by Canepa I of 90% of the share capital of Canepa Espa\u00f1a; the acquisition on 26 December 2011 by Canepa II of 90% of the share capital of Herome;72 the acquisition by Canepa Espa\u00f1a and Herome on 28 December 2011 of certain wind parks;73 and the acquisition by Canepa Espa\u00f1a and Herome on 2 March 2012 of certain other wind parks,74 for a total of five wind parks.75 The Claimants' case appears to be that, after this time (commencing in December 2012), the Respondent engaged in conduct that violated the Claimants' investment rights under the ECT. The Claimants' case does not appear to be that the investments occurred on some date prior to the incorporation of the Claimants.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 53.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 53.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 53, n. 60; Memorial, \u00a7 3.1; Claimants' Exhibit C-24.\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 53, n. 60; Memorial, \u00a7 3.1; Claimants' Exhibit C-25.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 51.\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal majority acknowledges that various statements found in the Claimants' pleadings refer to the \"Claimants\" taking action of one kind or another prior to December 2011. The Tribunal interprets such statements as a short-hand way of referring to steps that were taken leading up to the formal incorporation of the Claimants as legal persons, by those interested in pursuing these investments. For purposes of whether there is an \"investment\" falling within the scope of the ECT, however, the salient issue is whether the Claimants, first, were incorporated in Luxembourg and, second, thereafter made an investment in Spain. From the record as it currently stands, this appears to be the case.\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there was no \"investment\" because the Claimants did not make an economic contribution nor assumed any risk when acquiring the investment. The Tribunal majority regards factors such as whether there was \"a contribution,\" \"an element of risk,\" or \"a certain duration\" as helpful when analysing whether an unusual transaction falls within the scope of a particular treaty's definition of \"investment.\" In this instance, however, ECT Article 1(6) contains a rather broad definition of \"investment,\" as Respondent itself recognizes.76 That definition encompasses \"every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor,\" to include \"any property rights\" and \"a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock or other forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise.\" Further, the definition does not include any express requirement that there be an economic contribution or an element of risk for there to be an \"investment,\" as has been noted by other tribunals.77\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 162.\n\nSee, e.g., *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.\u00e0 r.l v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 June 2016 (CL-0136), \u00b6 158 (\"[T]here is no requirement for any assumption of risk contained in the ECT or the ICSID Convention, just as there is no requirement for funds to be brought into a State from overseas in order for a national of one State to have an investment in another State.\"); *Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energ\u00eda Solar Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36, Award, 4 May 2017 (CL-0082), \u00b6 228 (\"the origins of capital invested by an Investor in an Investment are not relevant for purposes of jurisdiction.\").\n\n74.\n\nOn the facts currently before the Tribunal, the Claimants in December 2011 acquired shares in Canepa Espa\u00f1a and Herome, apparently by means of increasing their capital. Regardless of the details of how the acquisition occurred, including whether the capital originated from a loan made to the Claimants, it appears that, as of December 2011, the Claimants owned directly or indirectly assets in Spain, through equity participation in Spanish enterprises. Such facts do not suggest an unusual or doubtful transaction, such as a sale of goods, that would or might fall outside the scope of an ECT \"investment.\" Rather, the acquisition of shares in a foreign company is a common vehicle for making an investment. As such, at this time, it appears that the Claimants economic activity falls within the scope of the definition of \"investment.\"\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that the Claimants are not the ultimate owners or beneficial owners of the wind parks, and therefore do not have indirect control over them, such that there is no \"investment\" by the Claimants. Here, too, there is no provision within the ECT that requires an investor to be the beneficial owner of the investment, either in ECT Article 1(6) or in ECT Article 1(7). The latter defines an \"investor\" with respect to a Contracting Party as being either: \"(i) a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law; [or] (ii) a company or other organisation organised in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party.\" In short, neither the definition of \"investment\" nor of \"investor\" contains a beneficial ownership requirement, as has been noted by other tribunals.78\n\nSee, e.g., *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. v Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31, Award, 15 June 2018 (CL-0085), \u00b6 262 (\"Article [1(6)] refers to direct or indirect control or ownership, but nowhere in its text or in the context of the ECT is there a requirement that only the real and ultimate owner or beneficiary may submit claims to arbitration.\").\n\n76.\n\nThe observations above cast doubt on whether the Respondent's first objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial. Moreover, detailed exploration of these issues would require careful analysis of the facts relating to the acquisition of the wind parks, including the corporate structures involved in the acquisition and the exact financial arrangements by which the asserted investment occurred, matters that are central to the merits of the case.\n\n77.\n\nAs noted at the outset of the Tribunal's analysis, the observations above are without prejudice to the possibility that, upon full briefing, there may be merit to the Respondent's objection. At this stage, however, the Tribunal majority does not see this objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction as most efficiently addressed in a bifurcated proceeding.\n\n**B. Lack of Jurisdiction because the True Claimants are of Spanish Nationality**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nOn the facts pled by the Claimants, both of the Claimants are private limited liability companies incorporated in accordance with the laws of Luxembourg. The Respondent maintains, however, that \"it is clear that the investment was negotiated, agreed, executed and controlled from Spain, by people and entities linked to the Spanish group Azora.\"79 Given that the ECT does not envisage dispute settlement between a Spanish investor and the Spanish government, the Respondent objects that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over this case.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 60.\n\n79.\n\nAs with the prior objection, the Respondent indicates that the information provided by the Claimants is \"insufficient and fragmented.\"80 At the same time, the Respondent has presented the BDO Expert Report, for the purpose of analysing the shareholder structure of the Claimants and their relationship to Azora. That report, however, also appears cautious in its characterization of the facts. Among other things, it finds that \"there are several relationships between Azora and Canepa that *could suggest* that the same people who control the Claimants *may also control* Azora.\"81 The uncertainties expressed by both the Respondent and that BDO Expert Report about the facts as currently understood, again somewhat diminish the force of the Respondent's position, in that the Respondent bears the burden of demonstrating that its objections are *prima facie* serious and substantial, a burden carried not by indicating that the facts are unclear, but by showing that the facts are unlikely to support the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 60.\n\n*Ibid*., BDO Expert Report, \u00b6 86 (emphasis added).\n\n80.\n\nOne thrust of this objection appears to follow portions of the first objection, by raising questions about steps that occurred prior to the date of the investment in December 2011, and by calling into question whether the Claimants are the ultimate owners or beneficial owners of the wind parks. In that regard, the Tribunal majority again recalls that the Claimants' case does not appear to be that the investments occurred on some date prior to the incorporation of the Claimants, and that there is no provision within the ECT that requires an investor to be the beneficial owner of the investment.\n\n81.\n\nAnother thrust of this objection is that the Claimants are effectively controlled by Spanish nationals, such that the nationality of the Claimants cannot be regarded as that of Luxembourg. The Respondent, however, has not advanced any support for the proposition that, under the ECT Article 1(7) or under the \"first limb\" of ICSID Convention Article 25(2)(b), the nationality of a juridical person turns on anything other than the place of incorporation.82 In other words, the Respondent has not demonstrated the existence of an \"effective control test\" for purposes of determining a claimant corporation's State of incorporation under the relevant provisions of the ECT or the ICSID Convention.83\n\nIf the Claimants were seeking protection not based on their nationality but, rather, based on being subject to \"foreign control\" under the \"second limb\" of ICSID Convention Article 25(2)(b), then issues of control would be relevant. That second limb, however, does not appear to be pertinent to the facts of this case.\n\nSee, e.g., *Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands, B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Arbitration SCC V 2013/153, Award, 12 July 2016 (CL-0137), \u00b6 670 (\"the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the ECT does not contain, like other Treaties, a derogation clause excluding the application of the criterion of constitution [a legal entity] under the laws of the country of another Contracting State where a legal entity is controlled by nationals of the other Contracting State.\"); and *TSA Spectrum de Argentina, S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/5, Award, 19 December 2008 (RL-0015), \u00b6 144 (\"The first clause of [ICSID Convention] Article 25(2)(b) mentions only the 'nationality' of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute. In other words, it uses as a criterion the formal legal concept of nationality, which for legal persons is determined by one of the two generally accepted criteria of the place of incorporation or the seat (*si\u00e8ge social*) of the corporation. There is no reference here to 'control', whether foreign or other, nor any mention of 'piercing' or looking beyond this nationality.\").\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal majority regards the observations above as casting doubt on whether the Respondent's second objection is *prima facie* serious and substantial. Moreover, as was the case for the first objection, detailed exploration of these issues would require careful analysis of the facts relating to the acquisition of the wind parks, including the corporate structures involved in the acquisition and the exact financial arrangements by which the asserted investment occurred, matters that are central to the merits of the case.\n\n83.\n\nAs noted at the outset of the Tribunal's analysis, the observations above are without prejudice to the possibility that, upon full briefing, there may be merit to the Respondent's objection. At this stage, however, the Tribunal majority does not see this objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction as most efficiently addressed in a bifurcated proceeding.\n\n**C. Lack of Jurisdiction Due to Claimants' Abuse of Process**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that their incorporation in Luxembourg occurred and was justified for reasons independent of any issues of dispute settlement under the ECT. Indeed, the Claimants assert that the dispute that has arisen was not foreseeable in December 2011, when such incorporation occurred and the investment was made.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent, however, argues that the incorporation of the Claimants in Luxembourg in late 2011 was solely for the purpose of changing the domicile of investments that were materially undertaken by Spanish entities, thereby allowing access to investor-State arbitration under the ECT. For the Respondent, such steps constitute an abuse of process, essentially in the form of forum shopping, which should lead this Tribunal to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction in this case.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the incorporation of an investor in a particular State prior to the making of an investment, for the purpose of taking advantage of a bilateral or multilateral investment treaty in case a dispute arises, standing alone, is not generally regarded as an abuse of process. Rather, issues of abuse of process typically are advanced in circumstances where, *after* a dispute has arisen, a transfer of nationality occurs to take advantage of investor-State arbitration84 or, at a minimum, the transfer of nationality occurs when there is foreseen a specific future dispute as a very high probability.85 The Tribunal majority is of the view that determining whether there has been such an abuse of process by the Claimants would require a much more developed factual record spanning the entire period of the asserted investment, including not just the various elements concerning the incorporation of the Claimants and the acquisition of the investments, but also the extent to which a dispute was foreseeable at the time of the incorporation, as opposed to the events giving rise to the dispute occurring only after the incorporation. As the Respondent itself notes, the examination of the circumstances that might warrant a finding of abuse of process \"requires analysis of *all of the facts of the case*, individually and as a whole.\"86 For the Tribunal majority, this includes not just facts leading up to December 2011, which the Respondent carefully recounts in detail in its request,87 but also the facts that unfolded thereafter specific to the Claimants' investment.\n\nSee, e.g., *Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009 (RL-0006), \u00b6 135 (\"Phoenix bought an 'investment' that was already burdened with the civil litigation as well as the problems with the tax and customs authorities. \u2026 In other words, all the damages claimed by Phoenix had already occurred and were inflicted on the two Czech companies, when the alleged investment was made.\").\n\nSee, e.g., *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012 (RL-0005), \u00b6 2.99 (\"In the Tribunal's view, the dividing-line occurs when the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a possible controversy. In the Tribunal's view, before that dividing-line is reached, there will be ordinarily no abuse of process\u2026.\"); and *Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People's Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 February 2014 (RL-0049), \u00b6 79 (\"The Tribunal considers that it is clearly an abuse for an investor to manipulate the nationality of a company subsidiary to gain jurisdiction under an international treaty at a time when the investor is aware that events have occurred that negatively affect its investment and may lead to arbitration. In particular, abuse of process must preclude unacceptable manipulations by a claimant acting in bad faith who is fully aware prior to the change in nationality of the 'legal dispute,'\u2026.\").\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 267 (emphasis added); *see ibid*., \u00b6 265 (\"All of the circumstances of the specific case must be analysed in detail to confirm the existence of abuse of process.\").\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 307-50.\n\n87.\n\nAlthough a finding on this third objection in favour of the Respondent would have the effect of ending the case, the Tribunal majority regards the steps needed to address the objection as most efficiently undertaken in the context of a full briefing by the Parties on the merits, rather than an analysis conducted only in a jurisdictional proceeding. As such, the Tribunal majority does not see this objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction as most efficiently addressed in a bifurcated proceeding.\n\n**D. Lack of Jurisdiction Due to ECT Article 17**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimants have brought their claims against the Respondent pursuant to the dispute settlement procedure available under the ECT. The Respondent, however, maintains that the Claimants are not protected under the ECT pursuant to ECT Article 17, because the \"Claimants are mere instrumental masks whose possession corresponds to companies located in tax havens that are not part of the ECT\"88 and the \"activity and structure of the Claimant's shareholders constitutes transactions prohibited by the Kingdom of Spain.\"89 As such, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in this case.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 361.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 405.\n\n89.\n\nArticle 17 of the ECT, which is entitled \"Non-Application of Part III in Certain Circumstances,\" provides as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part to:\n\n(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organised; or\n\n(2) an Investment, if the denying Contracting Party establishes that such Investment is an Investment of an Investor of a third state with or as to which the denying Contracting Party:\n\n(a) does not maintain a diplomatic relationship; or\n\n(b) adopts or maintains measures that:\n\n(i) prohibit transactions with Investors of that state; or\n\n(ii) would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Part were accorded to Investors of that state or to their Investments.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Article 17 addresses the scope of the substantive provisions of ECT Part III, and does not address whether this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute that has arisen in this case. In other words, assuming that the conditions set forth in ECT Article 26 are met, then that article establishes the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to decide a dispute concerning an alleged breach of an obligation set forth in Part III. When exercising that jurisdiction, the Tribunal may find on the merits that an obligation set forth in Part III was or was not violated, or may find that Article 17 operates so as to deny the advantages of the Part III protections. In either event, the Tribunal majority is of the view that it would be passing judgment upon the merits of the claims, not on its jurisdiction to decide the claims. Indeed, the location of Article 17 within Part III, rather than appearing as a component of Article 26, is suggestive of a desire by the Contracting Parties that jurisdiction exists to resolve a dispute relating to whether the conditions of Article 17 have been met.90 As such, the Tribunal majority regards the Respondent's fourth objection as not falling within the scope Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, and is not properly addressed through a bifurcation proceeding.\n\nSee, e.g, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005 (RL-0019), \u00b6 148 (\"the object and purpose of the ECT, in the Tribunal's view, clearly requires Article 26 to be unaffected by the operation of Article 17(1)\").\n\n**E. Lack of Jurisdiction over an Intra-European Union Dispute**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants in this case are incorporated in Luxembourg, which is a Member State of the EU. Further, the Claimants have brought a claim against the Kingdom of Spain, another Member State of the EU.\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent objects that Article 26 of the ECT does not apply to such an intra-EU dispute. In its view, allowing such a dispute to be decided by arbitration would contravene the rules of the EU internal market, notably the autonomy and primacy of EU law. In this regard, the Respondent views as relevant the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the *Achmea* case, as well as the January 2019 declaration by certain EU Member States. The Respondent's position is supported by the statement made by the European Commission in its request to intervene in this case, which is a part of the record before the Tribunal. By contrast, the Claimants maintain that the objection is \"plainly frivolous,\"91 viewing the *Achmea* judgment as not relevant to the ECT and the January 2019 declaration as not pertinent to this case. As previously noted, the Claimants assert that \"35 separate ECT tribunals have faced the Intra-EU Objection and each of those tribunals has rejected it.\"92\n\nObservations on Bifurcation, \u00b6 132.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 122.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal is not prepared at this stage in the proceedings to view the objection as not serious and substantial. Among other things, the Tribunal is not bound by the decisions of other tribunals, and there are some developments, such as the January 2019 declaration, which were not before some of those other tribunals.\n\n94.\n\nEven so, the Tribunal is cognizant that this issue has arisen in numerous intra-EU investor-State arbitrations under the ECT and that, in virtually all cases, the issue was not addressed through bifurcation. The Tribunal is inclined not to do so as well, finding that it would benefit from a better understanding of the provisions at issue under the ECT, their application in the context of this particular case, and their relation to EU law. For example, such relationships might concern analysing whether the particular benefits granted to the Claimants in this case were inconsistent with EU law and whether the particular Spanish measures contested by the Claimants in this case were taken in implementation of EU law. That better understanding will best be reached by means of a thorough airing of the facts and law of this case, approximating what would be necessary at a merits stage.\n\n95.\n\nAs such, the Tribunal regards the steps needed to address the fifth objection as most efficiently undertaken in the context of a full briefing by the Parties on the merits. Therefore, the Tribunal does not see this objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction as most efficiently addressed in a bifurcated proceeding.\n\n**F. Lack of Jurisdiction Due to Failure to Fulfil Arbitration Pre-requisites**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nBased on the facts currently before the Tribunal, it appears that the Claimants notified the Respondent of the existence of a dispute and requested negotiations pursuant to ECT Article 26 by letter of June 2015, and then followed up again by letter in June 2017. The Respondent, however, argues that it was not validly notified of the dispute in accordance with Article 26 prior to the commencement of the arbitral proceedings in February 2019, because Claimants' correspondence was in English and not in Spanish.\n\n97.\n\nOn the present record, it appears that this sixth objection *prima facie* is not serious and substantial. While further development of the factual record may prove otherwise, it appears that the Respondent reacted in writing to the Claimants' request in August 2017, and did so in English,93 after which the two sides met in person in September 2017. The proceedings in this case were then commenced in February 2019. Under these circumstances, it appears that the Respondent was on notice as to the existence of a dispute and of a request for an amiable settlement, both in writing and through an in-person meeting. In such circumstances, the Tribunal does not view it as appropriate for this objection to serve as a basis for bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 148.\n\n**G. Lack of Jurisdiction over Tax Measures**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nAmong the Claimants' claims is a claim arising out of a 7% tax levy that was imposed by the Respondent in 2015. While the Claimants maintain that the levy was not a *bona fide* tax measure, the Respondent argues that it was, and further that the ECT Article 21 precludes application of the ECT to taxation measures, except in limited circumstances not at issue in this case.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal regards this seventh objection *prima facie* as serious and substantial. At the same time, this claim appears to represent just a portion of the Claimants' overall claims, such that disposition of this issue through bifurcation would not, standing alone, materially reduce the scope of the merits stage, and thus would not promote efficiency in the disposition of this case. In such circumstances, the Tribunal does not view it as appropriate for this objection to serve as a basis for bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n100.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal, by majority, determines and orders as follows:\n\na. The Respondent's Request for Bifurcation is denied; and\n\nb. The procedural calendar set forth in Option 2.2 of Procedural Order No. 2 is now in effect, and therefore the Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction is due on 6 November 2020."}]}
