Mart\u00ednez de Hoz\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI agree with the description of facts, reasoning and conclusions stated by the Tribunal in the Award (the **Award**) in relation to its jurisdiction over the Claim and Claimants' claims regarding an alleged breach of Articles 10.5 and 10.7 of the Treaty and quantum. I also agree with the reasoning and conclusions of the Tribunal in relation to Respondent's Counterclaim and on the allocation of costs.\n\n2.\n\nNevertheless, I believe it is appropriate to make some additional considerations in relation to the alleged breach by Nicaragua of Article 10.5 of the Treaty which, in my view, provide broader context to the dispute between the Parties.\n\n3.\n\nExcept as otherwise stated herein, all capitalized terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Award.\n\n4.\n\nAs explained by the Tribunal, Nicaragua is not responsible for lON's failure to establish a discovery of commercial reserves and to perform the Evaluation Program, nor for its inability to assemble the financial and technical resources for such purpose, let alone for carrying out a commercial exploitation of the Concession Area. Nevertheless, as explained below, Nicaragua's conduct seems to have contributed to the dispute between the Parties, and though as concluded by the Tribunal, such behavior does not rise to a breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty, it caused uncertainty as to the status of the Contract, thereby prolonging unnecessarily its continuity and the incurrence of expenses by ION and Claimants, even if these were incurred at their own risk.1\n\nConcession Contract, Article 3, **Exhibit C-3.**\n\n5.\n\nOn October 22, 2013, upon the expiration of the 180-day period to carry out the Evaluation Program, Vice Minister Lanza sent a letter to ION communicating that the MEM was terminating the Contract according to Article 70(b) of Law 286. **(First Termination)**.2\n\nLetter from the MEM to ION dated October 22, 2013, **Exhibit C-25.**\n\n6.\n\nOn November 6, 2013, ION requested a review of MEM's First Termination arguing factual and legal errors. On November 20, 2013, Ms. Lanza on behalf of MEM, rejected lON's request on grounds that the exploration phase had finalized on November 13, 2012, and that ION had been granted an opportunity to carry out an Evaluation Program to determine whether its hydrocarbons discovery was commercial, but that ION had lost this opportunity because it failed to comply with the 180-day deadline established by MEM. The MEM also argued that its decision to terminate was based on Article 70(b) of Law 286 (failure to declare commerciality upon the expiration of the exploration phase) and Article 70(e) thereof (for causes established in the Contract).3\n\nMEM letter to ION dated November 20, 2014, **Exhibit C 131.**\n\n7.\n\nIn response to an administrative appeal filed by ION, on December 19, 2013, Minister Rappaccioli, acting on behalf of the MEM, upheld lON's appeal and reinstated the Contract by formal resolution No. 22 (the **December 19, 2013 Resolution**).4\n\nLetter from the MEM to ION dated December 19, 2013, **Exhibit C-26.**\n\n8.\n\nThe MEM's decision to revoke the First Termination and reinstate the Contract was based on different considerations. The December 19, 2013 Resolution expressly acknowledged that the exploration phase had finalized on November 13, 2012 and that it was now *outside the exploration phase.5* The resolution also stated that the Contract was in an *evaluation phase* considered to be an *intermediate phase between exploration and exploitation that* could *take place once finalized the exploration phase (six years plus a one year extension) as occurs in the present case.6*\n\n*Ibid,* p. 3. (Spanish original version: *...por Io anterior nos encontramos fuera de la etapa de exploraci\u00f3n...).*\n\n*Ibid,* pp. 3-4. The existence of an intermediate phase was also advocated by Nicaragua's witnesses Ms. Lanza (RWS-Lanza I, \u00b6 28 and RWS- Lanza II, \u00b6 30) and Ms. Artiles (RWS-Artiles I \u00b6 46 and RWS- Artiles II, \u00b6 26).\n\n9.\n\nAccording to Respondent, this decision was driven by policy reasons, because *determining whether there was commercial potential in the Concession area was a matter of high national priority* since Nicaragua *had no other onshore prospects for hydrocarbon exploration, and no other investors interested in developing this area.7*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 160.\n\n10.\n\nThe so called intermediate phase is not expressly regulated by Law 286 or the Contract, and Nicaragua's witnesses and legal expert confirmed at the Hearing that the Contract only included two phases: exploration and exploitation.8 Nicaragua's legal expert Ms. Rizo and Respondent's witness Ms. Artiles that monitored the Contract, stated that, under normal circumstances, the Evaluation Program should have been completed during the exploration phase.9 Moreover, Ms. Artiles and Vice Minister Lanza were not able to identify at the Hearing the legal basis supporting the intermediate phase of the Contract invoked to support the reinstatement of the Contract.10\n\nLegal expert Ms. Rizo's cross examination (Tr. ENG, Day 3, p. 775:12 and 20; Tr. SPA, Day 3, p. 783:14-21; p. 784: 1; p. 785: 10-17); and Ms. Artiles' cross examination, Tr. ENG, Day 3, p. 687: 12-19.\n\nMs. Rizo cross examination, Tr. SPA, Day 3, p. 785: 10-21; and p. 786: 1-2; and Ms. Artiles' cross examination, Tr. ENG, Day 3, p. 690: 2-9.\n\nNicaragua's witness Ms. Artiles that monitored the Contract as director of Oil Development of MEM between 2007 and 2017, admitted in her cross examination that she did not have a legal answer to that question *(I don't have a legal answer that I can give you).* Tr. ENG, Day 3, p. 776: 5-16; p. 728: 16-22 and p. 729: 1-6. Ms. Lanza, Vice Minister of MEM and General Director of Hydrocarbons between 2007 and 2015 also stated in her cross examination that she did not know the legal basis for the reinstatement of the Contract. Tr. ENG, Day 2, p. 520: 2-11, p. 587: 12-22 and p. 588: 1.\n\n11.\n\nThe discussion between the Parties on this point arises largely because the situation that presented itself with the performance of the Contract was not foreseen by Law 286 nor the Contract. In fact, the law seems to assume that the discovery would be made sufficiently in advance of the end of the exploration phase to leave time for the 180-day evaluation process provided for in Article 42(d) of Law 286 so that, in case of successful completion of said process, contractors could make a declaration of a commercial discovery and transition directly to the exploitation phase at the end of the exploration phase. In the case at hand, however, since ION only announced its purported *descubrimiento\"* at the very last moment of the exploration phase, there was no time left for the evaluation to take place before the end of that phase.\n\n12.\n\nLaw 286 and the Contract do not contemplate specifically the situation described above. From this, however, it does not follow that simply by declaring *\"un descubrimiento significante que puede convertirse en comercial*11 at the end of the exploration phase (the six-year duration of which had been extended several times to approximately ten years),12 ION could without more enter the exploitation phase. Moreover, the aforementioned lack of specification does not provide a legal basis for continuing with the exploitation of the Concession Area in the absence of a commercial discovery, particularly in light of Article 70(b) of Law 286 which before listing the causes of automatic termination of the Contract (including absence of a commercial discovery upon the termination of the exploration phase), clarifies that [the contracts] *terminar\u00e1n sin requisito previo.* Sound international practice consistent with the system of Law 286 and the Contract would have suggested that Nicaragua could have evaluated the commerciality of the discovery on the basis of the information reported by ION as of such time and could have conditioned the continuity of the Contract to the outcome of that analysis. Instead, Nicaragua allowed the Contract to continue for more than two years on the basis of policy reasons.\n\nION Declaration of Discovery, November 6, 2012, **Exhibit C-16.** See \u00b6 160 *supra.*\n\nThe Contract was first extended for one year in early 2009, upon request by Norwood (see \u00b6 135 *supra).* ION was then granted a one-year extension under Article 36 of Law 286 on November 14, 2011 (see \u00b6 143 *supra).* Afterwards, ION was granted two 180-day extensions to undergo the evaluation procedure under Article 42(c) of Law 286: the first one on November 19, 2012, after lON's purported declaration of discovery (see \u00b6 164 *supra),* and the second one on December 19, 2013, when the First Termination was reversed (see \u00b6 168 *supra).*\n\n13.\n\nStarting in 2014, the record shows that MEM changed its view towards ION and the continuity of the Contract. On December 3, 2014, Minister Rappaccioli, on behalf of MEM, sent the Termination Letter terminating the Contract on grounds that ION had failed to carry out the activities undertaken in the Evaluation Program and had not declared the commerciality of the discovery.13 The decision was based on Article 70(b) of Law 286, that was made part of the Contract by Article 32.1 thereof. lON's continuing delay in performing the Evaluation Program and its inability to find economic and technical resources for such purpose was one of the main reasons for MEM's decision to terminate the Contract. The record also shows that other factors could have also been relevant, such as the conversations maintained by MEM and Nicaragua's national oil company, Petronic, with potential investors, some of which were interested in lON's Block.\n\nTermination letter of MEM dated December 3, 2014, **Exhibit C-34.**\n\n14.\n\nHowever, as concluded by the Tribunal, Claimants have been unable to prove that the conversations and negotiations between MEM, Petronic and certain potential investors were a decisive factor for lON's failure to find funders or investors interested in acquiring an interest in lON's Block nor a decisive cause of Nicaragua's decision to terminate the Contract, and, in any event, based on the available evidence, these conversations do not seem to have materialized in any concrete investment.\n\n15.\n\nIn any case, pursuant to the available evidence, Nicaragua was not responsible for lON's shortcomings and particularly its lack of economic and technical resources. The record indicates that the lack of interest of investors in lON's Block was due to a number of factors, including the fact that Nicaragua was an oil frontier territory with no developed reserves of hydrocarbons,14 the absence in lON's Block of recoverable, let alone commercial reserves,15 the disappointing results of the tests carried out by ION and the reduced prospects of an up-grade of the prospective and contingent resources of lON's Block,16 all this compounded by the drop of the crude oil prices commencing in mid-2014 after the cycle of high prices between 2011 and 2014.17 Ryder Scott's18 and Quadrant's19 examinations were persuasive on these points.\n\nExamination of Dr. Flores, Tr.

Day 6, p. 1268: 17-22).\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1285: *\"Now, at that stage, November 2012, the 6-year-plus-1 of the exploration period had expired, and the MEM then had two options. Option 1 was to terminate lON's Concession under Article 70(b) precisely for not declaring commerciality under Article 42(b).*\n\n17.\n\nIn these circumstances, and particularly in light of the clear requirement that contractors complete the procedure envisaged in Article 42 of Law 286 to prove a commercial discovery before moving to the exploitation phase, ION was not entitled to continue directly with the exploitation of the Concession Area without completing the Evaluation Program and proving the existence of a commercial discovery. The fact that Law 286 did not provide a legal basis for the intermediate phase invoked by Nicaragua to predicate the continuity of the Contract after the expiration of the exploration phase in spite of the absence of a commercial discovery, and Nicaragua's policy to grant extensions, cannot be interpreted as a waiver by Nicaragua for ultimately terminating the Contract on the basis of Article 70(b) thereof, particularly in light of lON's repeated failure to perform the Evaluation Program and establish the existence of commercial reserves.\n\n18.\n\nMEM's approach in relation to the extension of the Contract beyond the expiration of the exploration phase could have created confusion as to its status. Moreover, Nicaragua's subsequent conduct when terminating the Contract raises issues as to its administrative propriety as described below. Nevertheless, none of these circumstances, including certain inconsistencies incurred by the MEM, that are described below, are sufficient to alter the fundamental fact that - in spite of Nicaragua having allowed the Contract to continue for more than two years after its scheduled expiration - ION was unable to assemble the technical and economic resources to drill a new well and perform the Evaluation Program. In the absence of a successful outcome of such drilling and Evaluation Program, ION was unable to evidence the existence of a commercial discovery, as required to continue with the Contract.\n\n19.\n\nWhen Nicaragua decided to terminate the Contract, it did so through a lengthy 18-month process between December 2014 and May 2015, characterized by several inconsistencies and administrative irregularities.\n\n20.\n\nOn December 3, 2014, Minister Rappaccioli sent the Termination Letter terminating the Contract on grounds that ION had failed to carry out the activities undertaken in the Evaluation Program and had not declared the commerciality of the discovery.23 There is no evidence of any preceding administrative termination proceeding. Nicaragua did not produce during the document production phase any evidence in this regard24 and through a letter dated March 25, 2015, MEM recognized the absence of such administrative proceeding taking place. Although it can be interpreted that Article 70(b) of Law 286 dispensed with this requirement because it provided for the automatic termination of the Contract *(\"terminar\u00e1n sin requisito previo),* due process and administrative propriety would have suggested a prior proceeding in which ION could defend its position. It is nevertheless equally true, that even in the absence of a formal administrative proceeding, ION had the opportunity to defend its position in the context of the numerous correspondence exchanged with the MEM.\n\nTermination Letter of MEM dated December 3, 2014, **Exhibit C-34.**\n\nReply, \u00b6 186 and footnote 420.\n\n21.\n\nIt is also unclear whether the MEM had the authority to terminate the Contract itself rather than through a Presidential Decree. This was suggested by Minister Mansell's March 25, 2015 letter stating that the Termination Letter was not an administrative resolution or act, and that it only intended to notify ION of MEM's intention to terminate the Contract due to lON's failure to perform the Evaluation Program, and thus would be followed by *[una] resoluci\u00f3n administrativo que en su momento deber\u00e1n emitir* ***los funcionarios competentes de este Ministerio,*** *con el fin de* ***cumplir con el sumario administrativo y el debido proceso.****25* Moreover, on October 27, 2015, the Attorney General of Nicaragua sent a letter to President Ortega's secretary requesting authorization from the President to initiate and execute the termination process of the Contract.26 This letter indicates that Nicaragua's Attorney General was also skeptical about MEM's authority to terminate the Contract.\n\nMEM letter dated March 25, 2015, **Exhibit C-40.** Emphasis added.\n\nLetter from the Attorney General to Mr. Oquist dated October 27, 2015, **Exhibit C-243.**\n\n22.\n\nSecond, the invocation of Article 70(b) of Law 286 as a legal basis for terminating the Contract could be deemed to contradict MEM's former position that the exploration phase had finalized in November 2012.27 Although the Tribunal has concluded that Nicaragua was entitled to terminate the Contract due to lON's failure to make a commercial discovery, its reliance on the intermediate phase theory had no legal support. Nicaragua also incurred in these inconsistencies when in October 2014, the MEM informed ION that it could not avail itself of the lengthier periods established by Law 879.28 ION wrote to MEM requesting that Law 879 be applied to the Concession.29 But Minister Rappaccioli informed ION that it was excluded from the new law because the Contract was no longer in the exploration phase that had finalized in November 2012.30 The issue at stake is not whether Law 879 modified Law 286 or the Contract in relation to the completion of the Evaluation Program (which it did not), but rather Nicaragua's inconsistency in respect of the grounds for denying the application of Law 879 and those invoked for terminating the Contract.\n\nArticle 70 of Law 286 **(Exhibit C-1):** Los *contratos terminar\u00e1n sin requisito previo en los siguientes casos: ... b) Al t\u00e9rmino de la fase de exploraci\u00f3n, sin que el contratista haya hecho declaraci\u00f3n de descubrimiento comercial y no est\u00e9 vigente un per\u00edodo de retenci\u00f3n.*\n\nLaw 879 of September 17, 2014, **Exhibit C-27.** The new law extended the exploration periods up to six years and the exploitation period for up to ten years.\n\nLetter from ION to MEM dated September 30, 2014, **Exhibit C-29.**\n\nLetter from MEM to ION dated October 7, 2014, **Exhibit C-30.**\n\n23.\n\nThe Attorney General's Termination Decision of May 24, 2016 added confusion. Minister Mansell's letter of March 25, 2015 had stated that the December 3, 2014 Termination Letter and MEM's letter of February 16, 2015 were not administrative acts and, on that basis, rejected lON's administrative appeal and ION'S referral to arbitration under the Contract. However, the Termination Decision specifically referred to these two letters as valid and relevant background for its decision to terminate the Contract without providing any explanation to reconcile both positions.\n\n24.\n\nAlthough the above referred matters lost relevance in the light of Decree 191 and the Termination Decision that overcame the issue of MEM's role in the Contract termination process, they are indicative of the procedural and transparency-related flaws in the termination process.\n\n25.\n\nThe inconsistencies described above could have caused confusion to the detriment of transparency and procedural propriety, and contributed to prolong the continuity of a situation *(i.e.* maintaining the life of the Contract in the absence of a commercial discovery and low prospects of new drilling efforts) that had been tolerated by Nicaragua on the basis of policy reasons. The Tribunal has explained the reasons why these improprieties did not raise the level of a breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty. Additionally, those circumstances did not change the outcome of the termination of the Contract by Decree 191 and the Termination Decision, nor were relevant factors in ION's inability to perform the Evaluation Program and find monetary and technical resources for such purpose.\n\nFebruary 22, 2023"}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**A****bbreviations and** **D****efinitions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \u20ac [#] | Euros |\n| Agarwal | Consolidated Agarwal Resources Ltd. |\n| Amended Sub-Contractor Agreement | The Sub-Contractor Agreement as amended on August 10, 2004 |\n| AR- [#] | Exhibits attached to the expert reports prepared by Dra.

I****ntroduction**\n-----------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis award resolves a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**ICSID** or **Centre**) on the basis of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (\"**CAFTA-DR**\" or \"**Treaty**\") signed on August 5, 2004 and entered into force on August 2, 2005 for the United States and on April 1, 2006 for Nicaragua, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThese proceedings are conducted in accordance with the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings in force as of April 10, 2006 (\"**Arbitration Rules**\"), except to the extent modified and/or supplemented by the CAFTA-DR.\n\n3.\n\nClaimants are the individuals with nationality of the United States of America and the enterprises constituted or organized under the laws of the United States of America identified in \u00b6 9 below (\"**Claimants**\") who claim to hold shares in Industria Oklahoma Nicaragua S.A. (\"**ION**\"), a Nicaraguan company.\n\n4.\n\nRespondent is the Republic of Nicaragua (\"**Nicaragua**\" or \"**Respondent**\").\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute arises from the termination by Nicaragua of a concession contract with ION dated April 23, 2004 (the \"**Concession Contract**\" or \"**Contract**\") for oil exploration and exploitation in a block in Nicaragua's onshore Pacific region (the \"**ION Block**\" or \"**Concession Area**\").\n\n6.\n\nClaimants contend that Nicaragua's conduct with respect to the Concession Contract constitutes an unlawful expropriation and a failure to accord fair and equitable treatment, in breach respectively of Articles 10.7 and 10.5 of the CAFTA-DR (the \"**Claim**\"). Accordingly, Claimants seek compensation for the damage they allege to have suffered as a consequence of Nicaragua's actions in an amount between a minimum of US$ 35.8 million and a maximum of US$ 198 million.\n\n7.\n\nNicaragua objects to the *ratione materiae* jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, on the grounds that Claimants did not make an investment in Nicaragua within the meaning of Article 25.1 of the ICSID Convention and of Article 10.28 of the CAFTA-DR. It also alleges that, under the Treaty provision invoked by them (Article 10.16.1(a)), Claimants are not entitled to bring on their own behalf a claim for indirect injuries as they seek to do in these proceedings. On the merits, Respondent contends that termination of the Concession Contract was \"*a lawful, bona fide termination of a contract according to the contract's governing framework*\" which cannot be considered an expropriation or a violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment.1\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 290, 296; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 256, 286.\n\n8.\n\nNicaragua also submits a counterclaim pursuant to Article 10 of the CAFTA-DR and Articles 25 and 46 of the ICSID Convention seeking compensation for damages caused by ION's alleged breaches of applicable environmental obligations (the \"**Counterclaim**\"). Claimants question the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the Counterclaim and argue that any breach of ION's environmental obligations would not be attributable to Claimants,2 and, in any event, would be minimal3 and related to \"*Nicaragua's arbitrary termination of the Concession Contract*\".4\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 529 \u2013 535.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 538.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 540 (\"*Nicaragua's arbitrary termination of the Concession Contract made it difficult for ION to complete the remaining remediation activity*\").\n\n**II.

ION is a company incorporated under the laws of Nicaragua on May 5, 1999 with the purpose of conducting hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation activities and marketing, importing and exporting oil and oil products.7 Claimants' status as shareholders of ION is contested by Respondent.8\n\nCertificate of Incorporation of ION, May 5, 1999, **Exhibit C-2**, Clauses 4(a), (c) and (f).\n\nSee Section IX.B.1.a below.\n\n91.\n\nRespondent is the Republic of Nicaragua.\n\n**VI.B The background of Claimants' involvement in oil exploration in Nicaragua**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nIn 1993, a group of US investors, including Mr. Harold Witcher, Mr. David Michael Goyne, Ms. Esther Goyne, Mr. Harold Shattuck, Mr. James Bochnowski, Mr. David Barish and Hills Exploration Corp., incorporated High Hills Petroleum Inc. (\"**High Hills**\") in Oklahoma, USA9 through which they aimed to carry out studies and search for oil onshore the Pacific coast of Nicaragua.10 This project was to be led by Mr. Harold Witcher, who had considerable experience in the oil and gas industry and had already conducted geological studies in that country.11\n\n\"Solicitud para la explotaci\u00f3n y producci\u00f3n de hidrocarburos y movimientos de tierras\", High Hills Petroleum, Inc., March 31, 1995, **Exhibit C-65**, p. 6.\n\nCWS-Goyne I, \u00b6 9.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 17.\n\n93.\n\nAfter gathering technical and geological information, analyzing satellite imagery, performing groundwork to ascertain surface structures and collecting samples of oil seeps for analysis and testing, on March 31, 1995 High Hills submitted to Nicaragua a formal request for permission to conduct a six-year exploration program.12 The request was not granted by the Nicaraguan authorities.13 However, one of the areas identified by High Hills in its proposal was one of those subsequently awarded for exploration to ION,14 as discussed below.15\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19; \"Solicitud para la explotaci\u00f3n y producci\u00f3n de hidrocarburos y movimientos de tierras\", High Hills Petroleum, Inc., March 31, 1995, **Exhibit C-65**, pp. 23, 24, 27, 53, 54.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 20; Reply, \u00b6 13.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 31; Reply, \u00b6 17.\n\nSee \u00b6 110 below.\n\n**VI.C The enactment of Law 286**\n---------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nIn an effort to modernize its hydrocarbon legislation, on March 18, 1998, Nicaragua enacted the Special Law on Hydrocarbon Exploration and Exploitation, Law No. 286 (\"**Law 286**\"), which allowed private companies to bid for concessions to explore and exploit hydrocarbons in Nicaragua.16 Law 286 was implemented by Decree No. 43-98 of June 17, 1998 (\"**Decree 43\"**).17\n\nLaw 286, March 18, 1998, **Exhibit C-1**, Articles 5 and 13.\n\nDecree 43, 17 June 1998, **Exhibit C-67**.\n\n95.\n\nThe object of Law 286 is described as follows in its Article 1:\n\nLa presente Ley tiene por objeto fomentar, regular y establecer las condiciones b\u00e1sicas que regir\u00e1n las actividades de reconocimiento superficial, exploraci\u00f3n y explotaci\u00f3n de los hidrocarburos producidos en el pa\u00eds, as\u00ed como su transporte, almacenamiento y comercializaci\u00f3n.\n\n96.\n\nArticle 13 of Law 286 confers on the *Instituto Nicaraguense de Energia* (\"**INE**\") the power to negotiate and conclude contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons, subject to the approval of the President of the Republic. Contracts with foreign companies can be concluded only with local subsidiaries or local branches set up in Nicaragua by the foreign investor.18\n\nLaw 286, **Exhibit C-1**, Article 11, which reads as follows: \"*Las empresas extranjeras para celebrar contratos al amparo de la presente Ley, deber\u00e1n establecer una sucursal o constituir una sociedad conforme a las leyes de Nicaragua; adem\u00e1s deber\u00e1n nombrar y mantener durante la vigencia del contrato, un apoderado legal con facultades suficientes para obligar a la empresa y domiciliado en el pa\u00eds*\".\n\n97.\n\nArticle 22 of Law 286, which sets out the scope of concession contracts, states:\n\nLas modalidades contractuales otorgan a los contratistas el derecho exclusivo de explorar, explotar, almacenar, transportar, vender localmente o exportar libremente los hidrocarburos que fueren de su propiedad conforme a las especificaciones del respectivo contrato.\n\n98.\n\nAccording to Article 25 of Law 286, the contractor bears all risks, costs and responsibilities for the activities conducted under the concession contract. Article 28 of Law 286 allows the concessionaire to resort to the services of subcontractors in the following terms:\n\nEl contratista podr\u00e1 utilizar los servicios de sub-contratistas especializados, conservando el control y la responsabilidad total sobre las mismas frente al Estado. En caso que el sub-contratista no cumpla con sus obligaciones de pago de impuestos, salarios y prestaciones sociales del personal local, multas y otros tributos de los servicios del sub-contrato respectivo, el contratista deber\u00e1 garantizar dicho pago.\n\n99.\n\nLaw 286 foresees two phases for concession contracts: exploration (governed by Chapter V) and exploitation (governed by Chapter VI).\n\n100.\n\nAs to the exploration phase, Article 33 of Law 286 provides that\n\nEl contrato deber\u00e1 especificar el programa de trabajo m\u00ednimo obligatorio, el cronograma de ejecuci\u00f3n y presupuestos de gastos e inversiones que el contratista acuerde llevar a cabo durante cada sub-per\u00edodo de la fase de exploraci\u00f3n, presentando las garant\u00edas requeridas para cada uno de los sub-per\u00edodos de la fase de exploraci\u00f3n. Estos programas de trabajo tienen que ser llevados a cabo conforme a las pr\u00e1cticas y t\u00e9cnicas actualizadas e internacionalmente aceptadas por la industria petrolera, seg\u00fan los procedimientos establecidos en el Reglamento de la presente Ley.\n\n101.\n\nThe duration of the exploration phase is 6 years. This period could originally be extended up to one year \"*para completar las perforaciones de pozos exploratorios en proceso o por necesitarse pruebas de evaluaci\u00f3n y valoraci\u00f3n*\"19 but, as discussed below, the maximum duration of the possible extension was increased to 6 years by Law 879.20\n\nLaw 286, **Exhibit C-1**, Article 36.\n\nSee below, \u00b6 200.\n\n102.\n\nThe obligations of the concessionaire in the event of discovery of hydrocarbons are governed as follows by Article 42 of Law 286:\n\nCuando se haya hecho un descubrimiento de petr\u00f3leo el contratista deber\u00e1:\n\na) Notificar de inmediato al INE del descubrimiento;\n\nb) Dentro del plazo de treinta (30) d\u00edas desde la fecha del descubrimiento, proporcionar por escrito al INE detalles del mismo y su opini\u00f3n sobre si tiene o no potencial comercial;\n\nc) Si el contratista considera que tiene potencial comercial, en un plazo m\u00e1ximo de noventa (90) d\u00edas a partir de la fecha del descubrimiento, deber\u00e1 presentar al INE para su aprobaci\u00f3n, un programa de trabajo de evaluaci\u00f3n y presupuesto de gastos, para determinar sin demora si dicho descubrimiento es comercial;\n\nd)Una vez realizado el programa de evaluaci\u00f3n y dentro de un plazo m\u00e1ximo de ciento ochenta (180) d\u00edas, deber\u00e1 presentar al INE declaraci\u00f3n escrita de que el descubrimiento es o no comercial.\n\n103.\n\nAs to the exploitation phase, the duration of which is 30 years but may be extended by five years,21 Article 44 of Law 286 provides as follows:\n\nSi el contratista en el ejercicio de sus derechos, declara la comercialidad del descubrimiento deber\u00e1 someter a aprobaci\u00f3n del INE, dentro de ciento ochenta (180) d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de cada descubrimiento comercial, un programa detallado por el primer quinquenio para el desarrollo y operaci\u00f3n del yacimiento.

According to the procedure in place, offers were to be submitted by January 31, 2003. They would be reviewed by INE's Hydrocarbons Directorate, which would decide whether to recommend their approval to INE's Director. INE's Director would then award and negotiate concession contracts (see INE Resolution No. 08-2003, April 11, 2003, published in the Nicaraguan Official Gazette No. 100 of May 30, 2003, **Exhibit C-71**).\n\n108.\n\nIn late 2002, ION concluded a sub-contractor agreement with Consolidated Agarwal Resources Ltd. (\"**Agarwal\"**), which according to Claimants was \"*a publicly listed Canadian oil and gas exploration company*\",29 and according to Respondent's witness was a company privately held by Messrs. James and Alan Charuk.30 Under that agreement, which is not on the record, it seems that Agarwal would receive a 70% interest in the concession that ION hoped to obtain, in exchange for financing and operating activities on behalf of ION.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 30; CWS-Goyne I, \u00b6 20.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 28; RWS-Charuk I, \u00b6 5.\n\n109.\n\nOn that basis, ION submitted a bid in the International Tender for a concession area covering the ION Block. INE declared the bid compliant with the tender requirements and accordingly recommended that ION be awarded a concession over the ION Block.31\n\nINE Resolution No. 08-2003, April 11, 2003, published in the Nicaraguan Official Gazette No. 100 of May 30, 2003, **Exhibit C-71**, section III.1; Memorial, \u00b6 30; Counter-Memorial, \u00b627. As *per* the procedure mentioned above (see fn. 28), INE's decision followed a recommendation of INE's Hydrocarbons Directorate, which was approved by INE's Director (see \"Estad\u00edsticas del Suministro de los Hidrocarburos 2002\"), INE, August 2003, **Exhibit C-72**, \u00b6 26; INE Resolution No. 08-2003, April 11, 2003, published in the Nicaraguan Official Gazette No. 100 of May 30, 2003, **Exhibit C-71**).\n\n110.\n\nOn December 18, 2003, INE awarded ION the International Tender, subject to the successful conclusion of a concession contract.32 The Concession Contract was executed on April 23, 2004 and granted ION the exclusive right to explore and exploit hydrocarbons in the ION Block (the \"**Concession**\").33\n\nINE Resolution No. 58-2003, December 18, 2003, transcribed in Article 4 of the Concession Contract, **Exhibit C-3**.\n\nConcession Contract, April 23, 2004, **Exhibit C-3.**\n\n111.\n\nDuring the course of the negotiations between INE and ION on the Concession Contract, Agarwal entered into an agreement with a publicly listed Canadian oil and gas exploration company, Norwood Resources Ltd. (\"**Norwood Resources**\"), for the sale of its rights under its sub-contractor agreement with ION.34 James Charuk became Executive Vice-President for Exploration of Norwood Resources and Alan Charuk became President of the Nicaraguan subsidiary of the company (Norwood Nicaragua S.A., \"**Norwood Nicaragua**\").35\n\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005\", Norwood, April 21, 2006, **Exhibit C-79**, p. 4.\n\nRWS-Charuk I, \u00b6 8.\n\n112.\n\nArticle 9 of the Concession Contract set forth ION's obligations, of which the following are relevant for the present dispute:\n\n3.

According to the Minister, the latter letter was a \"*reiteraci\u00f3n*\" of the Termination Letter which constituted \"*un aviso, previo a la resoluci\u00f3n administrativa que en su momento deber\u00e1n emitir los funcionarios competentes de este Ministerio, con el fin de cumplir con el sumario administrativo y el debido proceso*\".215 On April 21, 2015, ION filed an administrative appeal against this decision as well,216 which was rejected by the MEM on May 20, 2015.217\n\nLetter from the MEM (Mr. Salvador Mansell) to ION, March 25, 2015, **Exhibit C-40.**\n\nION Appeal, April 21, 2015, **Exhibit C-41.**\n\nMEM Resolution No. 45, May 20, 2015, **Exhibit C-42.**\n\n218.\n\nOn June 16, 2015, ION again wrote to the MEM complaining of a contradiction between the Termination Letter and its characterization by Minister Mansell as a mere \"aviso\" and requesting a meeting to attempt to settle the dispute amicably pursuant to Article 29 of the Concession Contract.218 Claimants' witness says that, at that point, ION suspended its activities in the Concession Area \"*until the MEM clarified the status of our Concession\"*.219\n\nLetter from ION (Mr. Michael Goyne) to the MEM, June 16, 2015, **Exhibit C-43.** See also Memorial, \u00b6 186.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 188; CWS-Goyne I, \u00b6 143.\n\n219.\n\nOn October 28, 2015, President Ortega issued a Presidential Decree (the \"**Decree 191**\") authorizing Nicaragua's Attorney General (the \"**Attorney General**\") to \"*inici[ar] y ejecut[ar] el proceso de Terminaci\u00f3n*\" of the Concession Contract pursuant to Article 70(b) and (e) of Law 286220 and indicating that the Termination Letter was an \"*Acto Administrativo Firme*\".221\n\nDecree 191, **Exhibit C-45.**\n\n*Ibid*., Section II.\n\n220.\n\nOn November 10, 2015, the Attorney General informed ION that he would proceed with the formal termination of the Concession Contract and invited it to the signing of the termination of the Contract on November 13, 2015.222\n\nLetter from the Attorney General (Mr. Hern\u00e1n Estrada Santamar\u00eda) to ION, November 10, 2015, **Exhibit C-47.**\n\n221.\n\nOn November 12, 2015, ION replied rejecting the termination and alleging \"*diversas nulidades, violaciones consuetudinarias e interpretaciones desviadas del contrato de concesi\u00f3n y la ley de la materia, que se derivan de una mala pr\u00e1ctica del debido proceso administrativo por parte del MEM en perjuicio del Estado de Nicaragua*\".

O****verview of the dispute**\n------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nAs mentioned, the dispute submitted to the Tribunal concerns Claimants' claim that Nicaragua breached several of its obligations under the CAFTA-DR by a series of actions which led to the termination of the Concession Contract and the loss of Claimants' investment in Nicaragua. The Tribunal is also called upon to decide on the Counterclaim, relating to ION's alleged failure to comply with its environmental obligations under the Concession Contract, Environmental Permit and Nicaraguan law.\n\n252.\n\nThis section outlines the main elements of the Parties' positions, which will be analyzed in detail in the reasoning on each of the issues to be decided by the Tribunal.\n\n**VII.A Claimants' position**\n-----------------------------\n\n253.\n\nClaimants argue that Nicaragua's termination \u2013 which they refer to as \"repudiation\" \u2013 of the Concession Contract caused them direct and substantial harm. According to Claimants, the termination gave rise to a two-fold breach of the Treaty by Respondent.\n\n\u2022 The first alleged breach concerns the obligation to accord the minimum standard of treatment (\"**MST**\") set forth in Article 10.5 of the Treaty. Claimants assert that this provision embodies a standard of treatment of aliens that is equal to the fair and equitable standard (\"**FET**\"). This would follow both from the text of the provision itself, which states that the FET is a component of the MST, and from the investor-State case-law that considers that over time the MST and the FET have converged. According to Claimants, in terminating the Concession Contract, Respondent breached the MST/FET by (*i*) violating Claimants' legitimate expectations based on the Contract, (*ii*) failing to act in a consistent, transparent and predictable manner, (*iii*) imposing on Claimants a measure (*i.e.* the termination of the Contract) not proportional to the breach at stake, (*iv*) acting in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner in choosing to terminate the Contract, and (*v*) failing to respect procedural propriety and to provide due process in the termination procedure.\n\n\u2022 The second alleged breach concerns Article 10.7 of the Treaty on the prohibition of expropriation. Claimants contend that the termination of the Contract also constituted an impermissible expropriation of Claimants' investments (both their shares in ION and the Concession they indirectly held through the Company). According to Claimants, that provision is not only applicable when a State exercises its sovereign powers (which is in any case what Nicaragua did), but also when a State acts in the exercise of its contractual rights. Claimants argue that the termination breached Article 10.7 because it was wrongful, fraught with procedural errors, driven by hidden purposes and unlawful, as it failed to comply with the conditions set in Article 10.7 itself.\n\n254.\n\nClaimants contend that those Treaty violations caused them to lose the contractual rights to exploit the Concession they held through ION, as well as the economic value of their shares in that company. According to Claimants, the corresponding damages should be quantified based on the FMV of the Concession as of December 2, 2014 (\"**Date of Valuation**\"). Claimants claim 58.02% of such amount, corresponding to their collective share of ownership of ION.\n\n255.\n\nClaimants contest all of Respondent's jurisdictional objections. In particular, they maintain that they have proven their status as shareholders of ION and that they qualify as investors under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention. Further, they argue that, contrary to Respondent's allegation, the Claim can proceed under the legal basis invoked by them, *i.e*. Article 10.16.1(a) of the Treaty.\n\n256.\n\nOn the other hand, Claimants argue that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Counterclaim, which they maintain falls outside the scope of the Parties' consent to arbitration. According to them, the Treaty cannot be interpreted so as to permit counterclaims. Even if it could be so interpreted, jurisdiction over the Counterclaim should still be denied, as the Counterclaim concerns purported breaches of contracts and of Nicaraguan laws, not Treaty breaches. In any case, Claimants assert that the Counterclaim is unfounded on the merits.\n\n**VII.B Respondent's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nRespondent objects to the Claim, both on jurisdictional grounds and on the merits.\n\n258.\n\nOn jurisdiction, Respondent raises two main objections:\n\n(i) *First*, it submits that Claimants have not made an investment in Nicaragua, and therefore do not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and of Article 10.28 of the Treaty, according to which only disputes relating to investments can be brought to arbitration under these instruments. Respondent contends that, because the Claim \u2013 which is for the damages suffered by them as shareholders of the Company that supposedly made an investment \u2013 was brought by Claimants on their own behalf, rather than on behalf of ION itself, jurisdiction can only exist if Claimants, as well as ION, qualify as investors. According to Respondent this two-tier test is not satisfied because neither Claimants nor ION have proven that they qualify as investors under the ICSID Convention and the Treaty. Further, according to Respondent, Claimants have not even proven that they own shares in ION.\n\n(ii) *Second*, Respondent argues that the Claim is not admissible, because it was brought under an incorrect Treaty basis. Specifically, Respondent contends that the Claim is for reflective losses (losses suffered by the Company of which Claimants assert they are shareholders) and should accordingly have been brought under\u00a0Treaty\u00a0Article 10.16.1(b) of the Treaty\u00a0rather than under Article 10.16.1(a), which is the basis invoked by Claimants.\n\n259.\n\nOn the merits, Respondent denies it violated Articles 10.5 and 10.7 of the Treaty, objecting to Claimants' arguments on both the characterization of the standards imposed by the two provisions and the application of those provisions to the case at hand.\n\n260.\n\nAs for the alleged violation of Article 10.5, Respondent contests the standard applied by Claimants, alleging that, by referring to the MST, the parties to the Treaty opted for a standard of treatment which is different from FET and entails a higher threshold for liability. But even if the FET applied, Respondent's behavior would be consistent with it. In fact, according to Respondent, the termination of the Contract was a lawful exercise of its contractual rights under the Concession and was respectful of the procedural rules of Nicaraguan law.\n\n261.\n\nAs for the alleged violation of Article 10.7, Respondent argues that termination of a contract by a State can only be considered an expropriation when the State acts on the basis of superior sovereign authority, outside the legal framework of the contract. As the termination of the Concession Contract was a legitimate measure adopted in accordance with Nicaragua's contractual rights under Article 32.1 of the Contract, rather than an exercise of sovereign authority, it cannot qualify as an expropriation.\n\n262.\n\nFinally, Respondent brings the Counterclaim pursuant to Article 10 of the CAFTA-DR and Articles 25 and 46 of the ICSID Convention. Respondent thereby seeks compensation for environmental damages caused by critical violations by ION of environmental closure and remediation activities required under the Concession Contract, the Environmental Permit and ION's Environmental Impact Assessment, as well as under Nicaraguan law, which \u2013 by virtue of Articles 10.9.3.c and 10.11 of the Treaty \u2013 also amount to violations of the Treaty. According to Respondent, Claimants, as ION's majority shareholders, are jointly and severally liable for the resulting damages.\n\n263.\n\nFor Respondent, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Counterclaim, as this satisfies the jurisdictional requirements for counterclaims under the ICSID Convention and the Treaty. Indeed, Respondent alleges that the Counterclaim:\n\n(i) falls within the scope of the Parties' consent to arbitration, which is established in the Treaty, and\n\n(ii) is sufficiently connected to the principal claim, as it arises from a Treaty violation incurred by ION in the performance of the Contract the termination of which is the basis of the Claim.\n\n264.\n\nION's violations of the closure and remediation activities assertedly caused substantial environmental harm requiring Respondent to incur remediation and restoration costs estimated at between US$ 4.920 million and US$ 5.561 million. Therefore, Respondent requests that Claimants be ordered to cover the costs of closure and restoration measures required to remedy the harm caused by them.\n\n**VIII. T****he relief sought**\n-------------------------------\n\n**VIII.A Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n265.\n\nClaimants request from the Tribunal the following relief:272\n\n(i) Declare that Nicaragua has breached articles 10.5 and 10.7 of the Treaty;\n\n(ii) Order Nicaragua to compensate the Claimants for their losses resulting from Nicaragua's breaches of the Treaty and international law for an amount of (*a*) US$ 35.8 million, as per the Claimants' DCF valuation, or (*b*) US$ 198 million, or US$ 139.2 million, or US$ 61.6 million, as per the different scenarios in the Claimants' loss of opportunity valuation, or in subsidy (*c*) US$ 44.1 million, as per the Claimants' sunk costs valuation, in all cases, as of the Date of Valuation;\n\n(iii) Order Nicaragua to pay pre- and post-award interest on the amounts set out in item (*ii*) above at a rate of 12.1 percent, or at any other rate that ensures full reparation, compounded annually from the Date of Valuation until full payment has been made;\n\n(iv) Declare that: (*a*) the award of damages and interest in items (*ii*) and (*iii*) be made net of all Nicaraguan taxes; and (*b*) Nicaragua may not tax or attempt to tax the award of damages and interest and/or order Nicaragua to indemnify the Claimants with respect to any Nicaraguan taxes imposed on such amounts;\n\n(v) Declare that it lacks jurisdiction over Nicaragua's Counterclaim;\n\n(vi) In case the Tribunal found it had jurisdiction over Nicaragua's Counterclaim, dismiss the claims brought by Nicaragua in their entirety;\n\n(vii) In every case, order Nicaragua to pay all the costs and expenses incurred in these arbitration proceedings, including the Claimants' legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and ICSID's costs, plus interest at a rate of 12.1 percent, or at any other rate that ensures full reparation, compounded annually until full payment has been made; and\n\n(viii) Award such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.\n\nReply, Section VII.\n\n**VIII.B Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n266.\n\nRespondent requests that the Tribunal issue an Award:273\n\n(i) Finding that it lacks jurisdiction over all claims brought by Claimants and dismissing the claims in their entirety and with prejudice;\n\n(ii) With respect to any claim not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, finding that Nicaragua has not breached any obligation under the CAFTA-DR, and dismissing the claims in their entirety and with prejudice;\n\n(iii) In the event and to the extent that Nicaragua is found to have breached any obligation under the CAFTA-DR, (1) finding that Claimants have suffered no compensable loss, (2) denying the compensation requested by Claimants, and (3) denying all interest claims made by Claimants;\n\n(iv) Denying an order that any award granted to Claimants would not be subject to taxation within Nicaragua;\n\n(v) With regard to Nicaragua's Counterclaim, in the event that the Tribunal determines it has jurisdiction, (1) finding and declaring that Claimants are responsible for failing to complete environmental closure and restoration activities at all affected areas within the Concession area, and that Claimants' failure to timely and properly perform its environmental closure and restoration obligations has caused environmental damage there, and (2) rendering a damages award in Nicaragua's favor to cover the costs of implementing appropriate closure and restoration measures at the sites and remedying the environmental harm caused by Claimants;\n\n(vi) In all events, ordering Claimants to pay all costs and expenses related to this arbitration, including but not limited to the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the administrative fees and expenses of ICSID, and all costs of Nicaragua's legal representation and expert assistance; and\n\n(vii) Granting any other or additional relief as may be appropriate under the circumstances or as may otherwise be just and proper.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nRejoinder, Section X.\n\n267.\n\nConsidering the above prayers for relief, the Tribunal will analyze in succession Respondent's objections to jurisdiction over the Claim (**Section IX**), Respondent's alleged liability for the breach of Articles 10.5 and 10.7 (**Section X**), quantum (**Section XI**) and the Counterclaim (**Section XII**).\n\n**IX. J****urisdiction over the** **C****laim**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**IX.A Respondent's objections to jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nAs mentioned above, Respondent first challenges the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Claim arguing that Claimants have not made a protected investment in Nicaragua either under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention or under Article 10.28 of the CAFTA-DR,274 according to both of which only disputes relating to investments can be brought to arbitration under the Convention and the Treaty. This first objection is discussed in **Section IX.B** below.\n\nCounter-Memorial, Section V; Rejoinder, Section V.\n\n269.\n\nRespondent also submits that Claimants' claims are barred because they were brought under an incorrect Treaty basis, *i.e.* Article 10.16.1(a) of the CAFTA-DR. In Respondent's view, the Claim is for reflective losses, *i.e.* losses suffered by the company of which Claimants are shareholders, and should therefore have been brought under Article 10.16.1(b) of the Treaty. This second objection is addressed in **Section IX.C** below.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that pursuant to Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention it \"*shall be the judge of its own competence*\" and that none of the Parties has raised any objection on this point.\n\n**IX.B Whether Claimants have made a protected investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n***IX.B.1 The Parties' position***\n----------------------------------\n\n***IX.B.1.a Respondent's position***\n------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nRespondent submits that, since Claimants brought the Claim on their own behalf, for the damages suffered by themselves, as shareholders of the Company that supposedly made an investment (ION), rather than on behalf of ION, a two-tiered test is required in order to establish whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction. That test requires demonstrating that each Claimant made an investment in ION and as well as that ION made an investment in the exploration for hydrocarbons in Nicaragua.275\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 222; Rejoinder, \u00b6 165.\n\n272.\n\nIn support of this two-tiered test, Respondent relies on *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Civile v. Guinea*, in which the tribunal noted that \"*the Arbitral Tribunal cannot take jurisdiction over the Claimant on the basis of a contribution that is not its own, even if the transaction in question could itself be qualified as an investment under the applicable law*\"276 and that \"*it is necessary that the expenses in connection with the relevant transaction are incurred by the person availing himself of the protection granted by the ICSID Convention or is in some way responsible for them*\".277 Respondent also highlights that the *Caratube* tribunal held that \"*there [\u2026] needs to be some economic link between that capital [used to make an investment] and the purported investor that enables the Tribunal to find that a given investment is an investment of that particular investor*\".278\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Civile Immobili\u00e8re de Ga\u00ebta v. Republic of Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/36, Award, December 17, 2015, **Exhibit RLA-89*****bis***, \u00b6 223. See RD-6, slide 22.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 231.

See RD-6, slide 23.\n\n273.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the test to determine whether an investment has been made is the same at both levels, that of ION and that of Claimants, and in both cases must be performed under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention as well as under Article 10.28 of the CAFTA-DR, as the \"*jurisdictional requirement of an investment under Article 25(1) is independent of a requirement in an investment treaty that an investor make an investment*\".279 For Respondent such a two-pronged test is required for two reasons. First, because the concept of \"investment\" has a different focus \u2013 and thus a different meaning \u2013 in investment treaties compared to the ICSID Convention.280 Second, because that test ensures that only disputes that State parties to the ICSID Convention consented to submit to arbitration are actually adjudicated by ICSID tribunals.281\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 229. See also Rejoinder, \u00b6 175, quoting *Global Trading Resource Corp. and Globex International, Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/11, Award, December 1, 2010, **Exhibit RLA-0050**, \u00b6 43.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 230, citing *Abaclat and Others v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, August 4, 2011, **Exhibit RLA-54**, \u00b6 347, and noting that \"*the concept of \"investment\" in investment treaties focuses 'on the rights and the value that potential contributions from investors may generate,' while 'the concept of investment as contemplated by the ICSID Convention relates more to the contribution itself'*.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 231.\n\n274.\n\nThe relevant test under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is the so-called *Salini* test according to which the elements of an investment are (*i*) contribution of money or other resources; (*ii*) participation in the risks of the transaction; (*iii*) a duration of performance; and (*iv*) contribution to the economic development of the host State.282\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.P.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, July 23, 2001, **Exhibit RLA-10,** \u00b6 52. See Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 233.\n\n275.\n\nAccording to Respondent, these elements are \"*the accepted starting point to determine whether there is an 'investment' within the meaning of Article 25(1)*\".283 Respondent observes that Claimants' denial of the crucial role of the *Salini* test in international investment law284 is contradicted by the very authorities quoted by them and that the case-law is settled on the point. In fact, for Nicaragua the only disagreement is on the indispensability of the fourth factor of the *Salini* test, the contribution to the host State's economic development, so that even if the Tribunal were unconvinced of the need to apply that factor, each Claimant would still have to satisfy the first three.285\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 233 and fn. 418, referring to a number of disputes in which tribunals took into account the *Salini* test to ascertain whether the investors had made a protected investment under the ICSID Convention. See also Rejoinder, \u00b6 178.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 240 ff.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 179-181.\n\n276.\n\nAs for the meaning of \"investment\" under the CAFTA-DR, Respondent argues that for an investment to qualify as such, it is insufficient that it takes a form listed by Article 10.28. In fact, it must also \"*have* 'the characteristics of an investment,' *which expressly include, but are not limited to,* 'the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk'\".286 Respondent maintains that, contrary to Claimants' position, these characteristics are not alternative, but that the point is in any case immaterial, as investment treaty tribunals have found that an asset has the characteristics of an investment if the investor \"*at minimum, make*[s] *an active contribution over a period of time that requires a degree of risk*\".287\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 184, quoting Article 10.28 of the CAFTA-DR.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 185 and fn. 365.\n\n277.\n\nFinally, according to Nicaragua, the characteristics listed in Article 10.28 of the Treaty \"*are virtually identical to the first three Salini factors*\", so that \"*regardless of whether the Tribunal determines that Claimants must satisfy the investment requirements of both Article 25 and DR-CAFTA (as Nicaragua contends), or only the requirements of DR-CAFTA (as Claimants argue), it must still decide whether each Claimant has satisfied the first three Salini criteria*\".288\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 186.\n\n278.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants have not shown that either they or ION made an investment that satisfies that test.289\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 222-223; Rejoinder, \u00b6 165.\n\n279.\n\nAs to ION, Respondent alleges that it does not qualify as an investor because:\n\n(i) Contribution: ION made no contribution to the purported investment. In fact, the responsibility for financing and performing exploration activities in the Concession Area was transferred to Norwood on the day of the signing of the Concession Contract.290 Thus, while Norwood would certainly qualify as an investor under the ICSID Convention and the Treaty, Respondent argues that the same is not true of ION.291 Respondent disagrees that resources contributed by Norwood can be imputed to ION, since ION and Norwood were separate entities and the latter operated according to its own interests, so much so that the Amended Sub-Contractor Agreement stated that Norwood was \"*acting independently of* [ION] *and not as a partner in any capacity, whether in oil and gas exploration and/or development or otherwise*\".292 As a matter of principle, according to the text of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and case-law, a claimant cannot \"*piggyback off*\" the investment made by another entity, but instead must offer its own contributions in order to satisfy the contribution criterion. Further, even if in principle it were possible to ascribe contributions of one entity to a different entity, ION's behavior does not allow this conclusion.293 Indeed, according to Respondent's account, ION made no contribution to exploration activities and did not even support Norwood.294 Further, Respondent notes that ION did not make any contribution even after Norwood exited the Concession, but merely requested extensions of the Concession while it looked for another company to provide resources and technical capacity.295 On this point, Respondent alleges that none of the activities listed by Claimants in their Reply296 satisfies the contribution criterion of an investment, apart from one check from ION to the MEM for US$ 2,385 dated March 11, 2014 on which Claimants, however, do not offer any information.297 Indeed:\n\n\u2022 the performance bond posted by ION on November 17, 2011 was paid by Claimant LG Hawaii Oil & Gas Co. and was collected for ION's failure to invest in exploration activities;298\n\n\u2022 ION's planned remediation activities were never executed (or at least properly executed), but in any case, would qualify as mitigation of damages activities and not as contributions to exploration activities;299\n\n\u2022 activities related to the LOC4 well cannot amount to contributions, as ION never conducted exploration work at the site;300\n\n\u2022 the Sproule and Davis Reports and a proposal for services by IRM were not paid for by ION (but by Claimant LG Hawaii Oil & Gas Co.) and anyway do not amount to exploration contributions;301\n\n\u2022 Claimants have submitted no information about the office ION opened in Nicaragua and how its activities amount to a contribution.302\n\n(ii) Risk: ION did not assume the risks associated with the alleged investment. In fact, ION's strategy in Nicaragua was always to insulate itself from risks associated with exploration activities*.*303 Norwood initially assumed the risk associated with the Concession, as demonstrated by the operating agreement between Norwood and ION,304 the Sub-Contractor Agreement and Amended Sub-Contractor Agreement.305 That ION did not bear any risk of the sort is evidenced by the fact that \"*ION did not similarly impair the value of its property or suffer financially as Norwood did*\".306 After Norwood's bankruptcy, consistent with its strategy to insulate itself from risk, \"*ION searched for another company to bear the investment risk*\" rather than bearing such risk itself.307\n\n(iii) Contribution to the economic development of the host State: ION failed to satisfy the fourth requirement of the *Salini* test.308 Any such contribution should be imputed to Norwood and Claimants' argument that those contributions were made on ION's account is unavailing.309 After Norwood exited the Concession, ION not only failed to contribute to Nicaragua's development,310 but even hampered it.311\n\nSubcontractor Agreements between ION and Norwood Resources Ltd. and ION and Norwood Nicaragua S.A., April 23, 2004, **Exhibit C-4**, p. 3; Operating Agreement between Norwood and ION, August 22, 2005, **Exhibit R-7**, Arts. 4.1, 5.1, quoted in Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 240.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 226.\n\nSee Amended ION-Norwood Sub-Contractor Agreement, August 10, 2004, **Exhibit R-3**, p. 3, as quoted in Rejoinder, \u00b6 226.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 230.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 227, 229.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 241-246.\n\nReply, \u00b6 263.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 214, 217.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 247; Rejoinder, \u00b6 211.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 212.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 213.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 215.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 216.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 256.\n\nOperating Agreement between Norwood and ION, August 22, 2005, **Exhibit R-7**, Arts. 4.1, 5.1, quoted in Rejoinder, \u00b6 220.\n\nAmended ION-Norwood Sub-Contractor Agreement, August 10, 2004, **Exhibit R-3**, p. 3; Subcontractor Agreements between ION and Norwood Resources Ltd. and ION and Norwood Nicaragua S.A., April 23, 2004, **Exhibit C-4**, p. 3, quoted in Rejoinder, \u00b6 241.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 254.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 255.

Additionally, Respondent claims that the terms of the Trust provided that it should have dissolved before the ION stock split and the ION shares distributed amongst the beneficiaries. Finally, Respondent argues that \"*if the shares were and still somehow are Trust property, Claimant Radu cannot bring a claim on behalf of the Trust without the other Co-Trustee, or without the other Co-Trustee's executed special power in favor of Radu allowing her to bring the claim*\" (Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 196-197).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 198.\n\n282.\n\nOn a second level, Respondent submits that even if Claimants' ownership of shares in ION were proven, this would not be sufficient to prove that they made a protected investment. By contrast, in order to satisfy the contribution criterion, Claimants should have proven that they committed resources to ION.319 In support of this theory, Respondent cites decisions in *Quiborax S.A. v. Bolivia*320 and *KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v. Kazakhstan*,321 which according to it \u2013 contrary to Claimants' assertion \u2013 are \"*directly analogous to this case*\",322 as well as *Caratube v.

Even if Claimants had proven their status as ION's shareholders, the mere ownership of shares would not be evidence of a contribution. In fact, the Respondent argues, Claimants should have proven that they committed resources to ION.326 Respondent argues that the evidence of contributions of resources relates only to some of the Claimants and thus cannot be imputed to all of them. The contribution criterion requires a personal contribution of resources directly related to the investment.327 A different interpretation would not only entail an excessively broad interpretation of Article 25 that would allow an investor to \"*piggyback off another individual's or entity's investment*\",328 but would also be at odds with case-law, as \"[t]*ribunals have consistently found that a claimant must satisfy the contribution criterion through their* [sic] *own contributions, not through the contributions of others*\".329 In this case, even if \"*one Claimant's investment could impute to another Claimant, no Claimant would satisfy the contribution requirement because no Claimant contributed directly to the exploration for hydrocarbons in the Concession area*\".330 In particular,\n\n\u2022 some of the individuals who allegedly made contributions are not shareholders of ION, but rather bring the Claim against Nicaragua as trustees. Any personal contributions of these individuals cannot satisfy the contribution element for shareholding trusts;331\n\n\u2022 some of the alleged contributions relate to exploration activities conducted in the 1990s332 Not only is there no evidence that those contributions were made by Claimants, but, in any case, those contributions would also not amount to contributions to the investment at issue;333\n\n\u2022 the US$ 900,000 allegedly spent by LG Hawaii Oil & Gas and LG Hawaii Development Corp. were not spent on exploration, but rather to obtain the issuance of the performance bond and \"*for unidentified purposes*\".334\n\n(ii) Risk: Claimants did not participate in the risks of the alleged investment. According to Nicaragua, that requirement is satisfied if *(i)* the investor \"*stands to either lose or win its commitment of resources towards* [its] *investment*\", *(ii)* the risk is related to the investment, and *(iii)* the investor does not use methods to shield itself from risk.335 None of these requisites is met. In fact, Nicaragua maintains that \"*because Claimants here have not shown that they contributed money or other resources to ION, they have not shown that they assumed any risk of losing money or resources*\".336 Nicaragua further notes that even if a contribution in ION had been established, Claimants still would not have assumed the risks associated with the alleged investment (*i.e.* the Concession), as \"*ION's strategy in Nicaragua was always to ensure that another company bore all the risk associated with exploration activities in the Concession area*\".337\n\n(iii) Duration: Claimants' alleged investment does not satisfy the duration requirement, pursuant to which the investment must last for at least two to five years.338 Even if Claimants had proven a contribution in ION, a number of them would have become ION's shareholders in March or April 2014, at best nine months before the termination of the Concession Contract,339 while others in February 2013.340 Respondent disagrees that the relevant timeframe to assess the duration of an investment is \"*the duration foreseen at the time an asset or property is acquired*\"341 and notes that even if that were the case, in February 2013 \"*Claimants could not reasonably foresee that ION's Concession Contract would last the two-to-five years needed to satisfy the duration requirement*\".342\n\n(iv) Contribution to the economic development of the host State: Claimants did not contribute to the economic development of Nicaragua, as no such contribution was made through ION.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 238-239.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 231.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 220.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 221 ff.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 231.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 233, 236.

Argentina*, Claimants argue that \"*the term* 'investment' *had been deliberately left undefined in the ICSID Convention*\" so that \"*the critical criterion adopted was the consent of the parties*\" under the relevant treaty.343 Accordingly, Claimants allege that, under the prevailing view in both doctrine and case-law, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention should not be saddled with requirements, such as the ones of the *Salini* test, which are additional to those listed by the applicable treaty.344 Rather, in considering whether an investment falls under the purview of the ICSID Convention, tribunals would generally defer to the notion of \"investment\" in the relevant treaty, which crystallizes the intention of the signatory States on the point.345\n\nReply, \u00b6 245, quoting *Malaysian Historical Salvors Sdn Bhd v.

Bischoff and R. Happ, \"*The Notion of Investment*\", in M. Bungenberg *et al*. (eds), *International Investment Law: A Handbook* (2015), **Exhibit CLA-144**, p. 3. See also Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 44 and \u00b6 50, where Claimants recognize that some tribunals have applied the *Salini* test as mandatory, but state that \"*the existing divergence confirms that, at the very least, the test is far from being an accepted standard*\".\n\nReply, \u00b6 246; Article 10.28 of the CAFTA-DR.\n\n288.\n\nClaimants add that even when tribunals have taken into account the factors of the *Salini* test, they have not considered them as \"*mandatory legal requirements that an investor must satisfy*\",348 but rather \"*as* 'typical features of investments*' that may be of assistance* 'in extreme cases', *provided that they are not invoked to defeat the definition of investment in the relevant treaty*\".349 The one at stake is not such an extreme case. Claimants deny that their position is contradicted by the case-law they rely on.350 They accuse Nicaragua of selectively quoting *Abaclat v. Argentina*, *Deutsche Bank AG v. Sri Lanka*, *Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina* and *Hassan Awdi v. Romania*, all of which rejected the notion that the *Salini* factors are mandatory requirements for an investment to be protected.351\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 240-243 and case-law quoted therein.\n\nReply, \u00b6 244, quoting *Philip Morris Brand S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v.

Morocco* was issued years before the negotiations of the CAFTA-DR even began, the Contracting States would have included the *Salini* factors in the definition of \"investment\" under Article 10.28 had they intended them to be a condition for bringing claims under the CAFTA-DR.352\n\nReply, \u00b6 246. See also Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 53.\n\n291.\n\nClaimants submit that the \"*characteristics of an investment*\" listed in Article 10.28 of the Treaty are not cumulative and mandatory, but rather, indicative examples expressed as alternatives, as evidenced by the use of \"*or*\" and by the expression \"*including such characteristics as*\".353 Thus, Claimants assert that, as underscored by case-law cited by Nicaragua itself,354 Article 10.28 simply requires an assessment of whether their assets have any of the characteristics of an investment, which are not limited to the three identified in its text.355 On this point, Claimants note that in any event the ownership of shares in an oil company presents the \"*quintessential characteristics of an investment*\", *i.e.* the expectation of profit and the related assumption of risk.356\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 18.\n\n*Ibid*., with reference to *Jin Hae Seo v.

See also Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 73.\n\n294.\n\nIn any case, even under the *Salini* test and Respondent's two-pronged test, the Tribunal would have jurisdiction over the Claim, as both ION and Claimants qualify as investors.\n\n295.\n\nAs for ION, it contributed to the investment. First, Norwood's contributions can be attributed to ION, as Norwood acted on ION's account and behalf, as established by the Sub-Contractor Agreement.359 Contrary to Respondent's assertion,360 the lack of a direct relation between Nicaragua and Norwood and the fact that Article 28 of Law 286 established that \"[e]*l contratista podr\u00e1 utilizar los servicios de sub- contratistas especializados, conservando el control y la responsabilidad total sobre las mismas frente al Estado*\"361 is relevant for this point, as it confirms that Norwood acted on ION's behalf in connection to the Concession.362 ION also made direct contributions both before363 and after364 Norwood's involvement in the Concession. On this point, Claimants object to Respondent's argument that only \"direct\" contributions satisfy the contribution criterion for an investment. In any case, all the activities mentioned in the Reply can be considered \"*exploration-related*\",365 also considering that \"*ION's sole business activity was the exploration and development of hydrocarbons under the Concession Contract. It follows that all of ION's actions and expenses were inevitably related to that activity*\".366\n\nSub-Contractor Agreement between Norwood and ION, April 23, 2004, **Exhibit C-4**, p. 2, quoted in Reply, \u00b6 260: \"*The duties of the Sub-Contractor are to conduct, at its own expense, specific work relative to Operations as defined in the Contract under the supervision and for the account of the Contractor*\".

See Reply, \u00b6 262; CWS-Goyne I, \u00b6 17.\n\nAfter Norwood's bankruptcy and subsequent exit from the Concession, ION maintained an office with full-time employees in Nicaragua, paid the performance bond that Nicaragua later collected, commissioned cleaning activities in San Bartolo, prepared and filed an environmental planning document for LOC4, performed a topographic survey on the LOC4 well and carried out road construction work, commissioned the Sproule and the Davis Reports as well as the IRM Program, prepared and filed a closure plan for San Bartolo and an environmental characterization of San Bartolo II and paid area rights and fees to the MEM. See Reply, \u00b6 263. In response to Respondent's argument that the payment for the performance bond, the Sproule and Davis Reports and the IRM Program cannot be qualified as contributions by ION as payments were made by some of the Claimants and not directly by ION, Claimants observe that \"[e]*ach of these payments was evidently made for the benefit of ION irrespective of the party wiring the funds*\", thus \"*Nicaragua cannot artificially discard them and pretend that they were not made*\" (Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 74).\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 78.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 78.\n\n296.\n\nION also satisfies the risk requirement. Claimants reject Respondent's assertion that ION shielded itself from the risks of operating the Concession and transferred them to Norwood,367 noting that \"*ION remained liable to Nicaragua for performance of the Concession Contract*\"368 in accordance with Article 3 of the Concession Contract.369 Moreover, the operating agreement between Norwood and ION assigned liability to both ION and Norwood in proportion to their respective working interests370 and limited Norwood's liability as an operator to losses sustained or liabilities incurred resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct.371 Further, any payment made by Norwood in relation to the Concession was made for the account of ION, which therefore remained liable.372 Finally, Claimants argue that \"*even if Norwood had shielded ION from all the risks while the Subcontractor Agreements remained in place (which it did not), this could no longer be the case after those agreements were terminated*\".373\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 253-254.\n\nReply, \u00b6 267.\n\nReply, \u00b6 266.

The transfer resulted from the share split of February 2013, but the new shareholdings could only apply after the Nicaraguan authorities approved the amendment of ION's governing laws (February 2014). The Trust was created in March 2014 and the new shares resulting from the split were registered as belonging to it (Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 38).  \nWith respect to the Nancy Cederwall Trust and Diane Elizabeth Radu, Claimants note that \"*Claimants brought a claim for 10,000 of the 20,000 shares owned by the Nancy Cederwall Trust, which \u2013 contrary to Nicaragua's claims \u2013 has not been dissolved (as no provision in the trust documents provides for its dissolution).

Nicaragua's contrary position was rejected by numerous investment treaty tribunals and Nicaragua misconstrues the cases on which it relies which dealt with specific and extreme circumstances \"*clearly distinguishable*\" from the instant case.385 By contrast, the case-law shows that there is no principled basis for excluding an investor from treaty protection because it has acquired shares gratuitously or for low amounts,386 as confirmed by the text of Article 10.28 of the CAFTA-DR387 and, according to Claimants, recognized by Respondent in its Rejoinder.388 In any case, Claimants argue that none of them acquired shares in ION gratuitously.389 As a matter of fact, it would \"*def*[y] *credulity that shareholders of an oil company holding a 30-year Concession Contract would simply give away their shares for free.

On the one hand, none of them acquired shares in ION gratuitously.391 On the other hand, Claimants made disbursements to finance administrative and operating costs ION incurred in connection to the Concession Contract.392 On this point, Claimants submit that Respondent misrepresents their position when it asserts that they are attempting to piggyback off investments made by others when they impute the \"contributions\" of some Claimants to the whole group. Indeed, Claimants' position is that even if Claimants were required to contribute resources beyond the ownership of shares, they have met this burden as they \"*evidently made significant contributions*\".393 Notably,\n\n\u2022 some Claimants \"*raised capital and invested their time and money to gather technical and geological information*\" in the context of the early 1990s exploration activities in Nicaragua;394\n\n\u2022 representatives of ION negotiated the Concession Contract;395\n\n\u2022 through ION, ION's shareholders sought and found partners to develop the Concession.

Claimants add that Respondent's argument is \"*particularly untenable*\" given that such trustees are also settlors of their respective trusts (and therefore hold in trust assets of their own), with the consequence that \"*the contributions made by those Claimants are necessarily reflected in the shares they hold in trust*\".403\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 235.

For ease of reference these instruments are reproduced here.\n\n307.\n\nArticle 25.1 of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n308.\n\nUnder Articles 10.15415 and 10.16416 of the Treaty, \"*investment dispute*(s)\" may be submitted to the dispute settlement mechanisms (including arbitration) foreseen by the Treaty. The provision of the Treaty that establishes the meaning of the expression \"*investment dispute*\" is Article 10.28, which contains the definition of the terms \"*investor*\" and \"*investment*\". Article 10.28 reads as follows:\n\n**investment** means every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk. Forms that an investment may take include:\n\n(a) an enterprise;\n\n(b) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise;\n\n(c) bonds, debentures, other debt instruments, and loans;\n\n(d) futures, options, and other derivatives;\n\n(e) turnkey, construction, management, production, concession, revenue-sharing, and other similar contracts;\n\n(f) intellectual property rights;\n\n(g) licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar rights conferred pursuant to domestic law; and\n\n(h) other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable property, and related property rights, such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges; [\u2026]\n\n**investor of a Party** means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party; provided, however, that a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality [\u2026].\n\n\"*In the event of an investment dispute, the claimant and the respondent should initially seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third-party procedures such as conciliation and mediation*\".\n\n\"1*. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation: (a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim (i) that the respondent has breached (A) an obligation under Section A. (B) an investment authorization, or (C) an investment agreement; and (ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out, that breach; and (b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this section a claim (i) that the respondent has breached (A) an obligation under Section A, (B) an investment authorization, or (C) an investment agreement; and (ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach* [\u2026]\".\n\n309.\n\nIt follows from these provisions that an ICSID tribunal has jurisdiction over a dispute under the Treaty if: (*i*) there exists an investment, (*ii*) the dispute submitted to arbitration is a legal dispute arising directly out of the investment, (*iii*) the investor is a national of a Contracting State other than the host State and (*iv*) the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit the dispute to the Centre.\n\n310.\n\nIn this case, the last three requirements are not controversial. The objection raised by Respondent only relates to the first requirement: the existence of a protected investment. Specifically, the Tribunal must establish whether there exists an investment pursuant to the ICSID Convention and the Treaty, and whether such investment is attributable to Claimants as investors.\n\n311.\n\nThe Treaty claims against Nicaragua are brought by Claimants acting on their own behalf, for damages they claim to have suffered as shareholders of ION, which is the direct owner of the alleged investment. For this reason, and in light of Respondent's objections, the questions for analysis are the following:\n\n(i) whether to qualify as investors it is sufficient that Claimants are shareholders of ION (**Section IX.B.2.a**),\n\n(ii) whether Claimants have proven their ownership of their shares in ION (**Section IX.B.2.b**),\n\n(iii) Whether ION made an investment under the ICSID Convention and the Treaty (**Section IX.B.2.c**).\n\n***IX.B.2.a Whether to qualify as investors it is sufficient that Claimants are shareholders of ION***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nGiven how Respondent has framed its objection to jurisdiction, the first question is whether the fact that the Claim is brought under Article 10.16.1(a) of the Treaty implies that, in order to qualify as an investor, each Claimant must prove that it contributed resources to ION or whether, instead, it is sufficient to establish that they are shareholders of ION, the owner of the supposed investment, as argued respectively by Respondent and Claimants.\n\n313.\n\nRespondent's position is that, because the claims against Nicaragua were brought by Claimants on their own behalf, rather than on behalf of ION, the *Salini* test must be satisfied not only in respect of ION, which is the direct investor, but also in respect of each one of Claimants, in their capacity as shareholders of ION.\n\n314.\n\nThis reasoning implies that, if shareholders bring a claim for indirect damages under Article 10.16.1(b) of the Treaty acting on behalf of the enterprise they own or control, they would only need to prove that the enterprise made a protected investment. Conversely, if for whatever reason (including because they do not control the enterprise or the enterprise no longer exists) they choose to bring a claim on their own behalf for the direct damages suffered by them, as they are permitted to do under Article 10.16.1(a), they would need to prove not only that the enterprise made an investment and is therefore an investor, but also that they too made an investment, beyond the acquisition of their shareholding.\n\n315.\n\nThis position seems difficult to accept. First, such an additional burden on the shareholder who elects to bring a claim under Article 10.16.1(a) \u2013 as opposed to Article 10.16.1(b) \u2013 does not result from the Treaty. This would seem to be conclusive since, whenever the Contracting States wished to impose different procedural or substantive requirements for the two pathways, they did so expressly.\n\n316.\n\nMoreover, a differentiation such as the one proposed by Respondent would lack any justification. Although there are authorities which could be held to support Respondent's position,417 the more convincing view is that \u2013 save possibly in specific circumstances where there may be a risk of abuse or circumvention of the jurisdictional requirements418 \u2013 there is no need to investigate how a shareholder acquired its interest in the entity holding the investment or whether it satisfies additional conditions to the ownership of shares.

Dolzer, U. Kriebaum and C. Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law*, 3rd ed. 2022, p. 79.\n\n318.\n\nAdditionally, it would potentially require complex and time-consuming factual investigations to ascertain how each investor acquired ownership of the interest in the company, and entail differences between one shareholder and the other, in many cases without objective justification.\n\n319.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal is not convinced of the relevance of the cases relied upon by Respondent to argue that the mere ownership of shares is insufficient to grant an investor protection under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.425 As a matter of fact, ownership of shares generally is considered sufficient, save in special circumstances.\n\nSee Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 201-205.\n\n320.\n\nFor example, *Quiborax* and *KT Asia* invoked by the Respondent deals precisely with peculiar circumstances distinguishable from the ones of this case. In *Quiborax*, a decisive ground for the tribunal's denial of jurisdiction over one of the claimants was that it had received one share gratuitously and solely in order to comply with a formality under the host State's corporate law.426 In *KT Asia*, the claimant was a foreign company that held a minority shareholding in a bank from the host State, designed to conceal the identity of the economic beneficiary of the shareholding. The company had never held any assets except for the shares in the bank, for which it had not paid anything, and had never made a contribution of any kind to the alleged investment.427\n\n*Quiborax S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, September 27, 2012, **Exhibit RLA-62**, \u00b6\u00b6 232-233.\n\n*KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v.

First, Claimants allege, credibly in the Tribunal's view, that they acquired shares in ION at a price, but are unable to reconstruct the paper-trail due to the passage of time.428 Second, as noted below, some of the Claimants made substantial disbursements and personal non-monetary contributions related to ION. Since ION's only asset is the Concession, such disbursements and contributions may be presumed to be related to the Concession.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 63.\n\n322.\n\nTo conclude, in the Tribunal's judgment, it is not necessary to verify that Claimants directly made an investment. All that has to be proven in order for them to be considered investors entitled to protection under the Treaty and to bring their claims is that they hold title to their respective shares in ION and that ION itself qualifies as an investor.\n\n***IX.B.2.b Whether Claimants have proven their shareholding in ION***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nMoving to the question of whether Claimants are shareholders of ION, the Tribunal accepts that the documents on the record429 confirm that such was the case for all of them at least as of April 10, 2014 and also confirm that the date on which each one of them acquired its shares is the one indicated in Claimants' Closing Statement.430 Further, the shareholders' ledger shows the number of shares each Claimant held in ION as of March 28, 2014 and the data contained therein matches the share certificates on the record.431 For this reason, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's argument on the alleged contradictions between the photographs of the ledger and certain additional documents submitted by Claimants (*i.e.* shareholder-meeting records), as well as the objection that \"*none of the Trust Claimants submitted with its trust documents a Schedule of trust property showing that it actually owns shares of ION*\".432\n\nIn particular, **Exhibit C-62** and **Exhibit C-198**.\n\nSee CD-5, slide 10. Tr. Day 6, pp. 1242:17-1243:4.\n\nSee **Exhibit C-198**, dated April 10, 2014. The certificates further show that Claimants hold registered shares, the transfer of requires a note on the security as well as an entry in the shareholders' ledger.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 198.\n\n324.\n\nAs for the objection concerning the Lopez-Goyne Family Trust's ownership of 110,000 shares,433 the ledger and the share certificates confirm that Michael David Goyne and Emily Lopez Goyne \u2013 in their capacities as trustees of the Lopez-Goyne Family Trust \u2013 hold 110,000 shares in ION.434 As demonstrated by Claimants,435 this equity interest can be traced to the 11 shares held by various trusts under the trusteeship of Michael David Goyne and Emily Lopez Goyne and is the result of a stock split (at a 1:10,000 ratio) approved by ION's shareholders' meeting on February 22, 2013,436 effective as of 17 February 2014 upon confirmation by the competent Nicaraguan authority.437\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the trust was created in 2014 and that its shares can be traced back to the combined holdings of shares of other trusts under the trusteeship of Michael David Goyne and Emily Lopez-Goyne (see **Exhibit C-198.M** and **Exhibit C-62**).\n\nSee **Exhibit C-198.M** and **Exhibit C-62**, p. 58. As noted above (\u00b6 323), the data contained in the ledger and in the shares certificates cannot be rebutted by shareholder-meeting records.\n\n**Exhibit C-62**, pp. 35, 45, 58.\n\n**Exhibit C-194**.\n\n**Exhibit C-296**.\n\n325.\n\nAs for the objections in relation to the Nancy Cederwall Trust, it appears that:\n\n(i) the ledger confirms that, as Claimants submit, the Nancy Cederwall Trust and the Nancy Cederwall Living Trust are the same trust, which has held shares in ION since April 20, 2004.438 Indeed, when recording the number of shares held by Ms. Diane Elizabeth Radu in her capacity as trustee of the Nancy Cederwall Trust as of March 28, 2014, the ledger refers to the entry at page 22 which notes the Nancy Cederwall Living Trust's acquisition of shares dated April 20, 2004;439\n\n(ii) the Claim is brought in respect of 10,000 of the 20,000 ION shares owned by the Nancy Cederwall Trust, corresponding to the portion to be allocated \u2013 upon distribution of the trust's assets \u2013 to the co-trustee Ms. Radu, the other trustee being Ms. Susan Mueller;440\n\n(iii) Respondent's objection to Ms. Radu's standing to bring the Claim without the authorization of the other co-trustee of the Nancy Cederwall Trust441 is moot as Claimants have submitted a special power of attorney executed by Ms. Susan Mueller ratifying any action undertaken by Ms. Radu.442\n\nSee **Exhibit C-62**, p. 73, p. 22.\n\nSee **Exhibit C-62**, p. 73, referring to p. 22.\n\nSee **Exhibit C-198.D** and **Exhibit C-62**, p. 73. See Memorial, fn. 491: \"*Diane Elizabeth Radu confirms that she is bringing this claim in her capacity as trustee of the Nancy Cederwall Trust, which holds 10,000 shares in ION. The Nancy Cederwall Trust (of which Ms Radu is also a beneficiary) is therefore also listed in this Memorial as one of the Claimants in this arbitration*.\"\n\nSee \u00b6 281, fn. 317 *supra*.\n\nExhibit C-303.\n\n326.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal concludes that all the Claimants were shareholders of ION at least from April 10, 2014, and collectively represent 58.02% of ION's shareholding. Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on Claimants' alleged lack of status as shareholders of ION is thus dismissed.\n\n***IX.B.2.c Whether ION made an investment under the ICSID Convention and the Treaty***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nHaving concluded that it is unnecessary to establish that Claimants are investors independently of their status as shareholders of ION and that they hold title to their shares in ION, the next question is whether ION itself can be considered a protected investor that has made an investment.\n\n328.\n\nIt is common ground that this must be verified under both the ICSID Convention and the Treaty. The Parties disagree on whether, in particular with respect to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, this analysis must be conducted on the basis of the *Salini* test which, as recalled above,443 postulates that an investment requires (*i*) contribution of money or other resources, (*ii*) participation in the risks of the transaction, (*iii*) a duration of performance, and (*iv*) contribution to the economic development of the host State.\n\nSee \u00b6 274 *supra*.\n\n329.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to engage in the debate on the applicability of the *Salini* test. This is because in the chapeau of Article 10.28 of the Treaty an investment is defined a \"*every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain and profit, or the assumption of risk*\".\n\n330.\n\nThis definition in essence embodies the first three criteria of the *Salini* test. As discussed below, in the present case all three of these criteria are satisfied. This renders moot the Parties' debate both as to whether the criteria of Article 10.28 are cumulative (as Respondent contends) or merely alternative (as Claimants say) and as to whether the *Salini* test is mandatory for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n331.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal can turn to consider whether ION is the holder of an investment.\n\n332.\n\nThe starting point is that ION is undisputedly the holder of the Concession, which is the asset affected by Nicaragua's actions purportedly in breach of the Treaty. The Concession is one of the forms of investment listed in the definition of Article 10.28 of the Treaty, which specifically mentions \"concessions\" in lit. (e), and also has the features of an investment listed in the chapeau of the definition. Indeed, the Concession required a \"*commitment of capital [and] other resources*\" in order to obtain and operate it; carried the \"*expectation of gain or profit*\" arising out of the exploitation of hydrocarbons in the Concession Area; and necessarily implied the \"*assumption of risk*\" associated with concessions in general and with the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in particular.\n\n333.\n\nRespondent does not seem to contest that the Concession in itself can be an investment. The point of contention between the Parties is whether the Concession can be considered an investment in accordance with Article 10.28 of the Treaty which is attributable to ION. In fact, according to Respondent, none of the requirements (contribution, risk and duration) is satisfied.\n\n334.\n\nAs to contribution, Respondent submits that whatever contribution was made, it was made by Norwood, and as such cannot be attributed to ION.\n\n335.\n\nIt is true and undisputed that the most substantial disbursements for the exploration of the Concession (approximately US$ 74 million) were made by Norwood,444 which performed exploration activities in the ION Block, including construction at the drilling locations, drilling and testing from 2004 to 2011. However, it is noteworthy that Norwood was not acting as assignee of the Concession Contract, but was acting on ION's behalf as a subcontractor, as permitted by the Concession Contract and Article 28 of Law 286, subject to ION maintaining \"*el control y la responsabilidad total sobre las mismas frente al Estado*\". Furthermore, pursuant to Article 25 of Law 286, ION bore all risks, costs and responsibilities for the activities conducted under the Concession Contract, including therefore those conducted by Norwood. ION's control of the investment is also demonstrated by the fact that it was entitled to terminate the Sub-Contractor Agreement in the event that Norwood failed to conduct its operations diligently and in accordance with applicable laws and the Concession Contract.**445** Nicaragua never objected to such arrangement.\n\nReply, \u00b6 45; Counter-memorial, \u00b6 5.\n\nSubcontractor Agreement, **Exhibit C-4**, pp. 3-4 and 7-8 of the pdf; Amended ION-Norwood Sub-Contractor Agreement, **Exhibit R-3**, p. 4.\n\n336.\n\nMoreover, ION undertook to compensate Norwood for the works performed on its behalf. The Sub-Contractor Agreement between ION and Norwood**446** granted the latter a 70% working interest in the Concession Area in exchange for funding and conducting the operations required under that Contract.**447** In the Tribunal's view, it is irrelevant that the consideration for the works performed by Norwood consisted of a percentage of any future profits generated by the Concession instead of payments from ION.\n\nSubcontractor Agreement, April 23, 2004, **Exhibit C-4**; Amended ION-Norwood Sub-Contractor Agreement, August 10, 2004, **Exhibit R-3**.\n\n*Ibid.*, pp. 2, 6.\n\n337.\n\nIn any event, following Norwood's bankruptcy in 2011, ION (or more precisely Claimants on its behalf) covered certain expenses and until the termination of the Concession its shareholders provided funding to ION and substantial non-monetary contributions.448 Claimants allege that between 2012 and 2014 they directly or indirectly financed ION's expenses for approximately US$ 1 million.**449** The most significant disbursement made in that period was for the US$ 300,000 performance bond posted by ION on November 17, 2011 and paid for by one Claimant, LG Hawaii Oil & Gas Co,**450** which also paid for other relevant expenses, such as the Sproule and the Davis Reports and the IRM Program.**451** Finally, it is uncontested that Claimants Michael Goyne (secretary of ION's board since November 2011 and president of ION since July 2012) and Emily Lopez-Goyne (in charge of ION's financial aspects) moved to Managua, Nicaragua, to work for ION.**452**\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 72 ff.\n\nReply, \u00b6 258; Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 72; Summary of Alleged Exploration-Related Expenses, **Exhibit C-283**, and documents referred to therein.\n\nSummary of Alleged Exploration-Related Expenses, **Exhibit C-283.**\n\n*Id.*\n\nCWS Goyne I, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 61, 70.\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Respondent's suggestion that these disbursements do not amount to contributions under the Treaty as they do not directly relate to exploration.453 Preliminarily, the Tribunal notes that the relevant test is not whether contributions are \"*exploration-related*\", as argued by Respondent, but rather whether they are related to the Concession. The performance bond, the expenses related to the Sproule Report, the Davis Reports and IRM Program, and the personal contributions of Michael Goyne and Emily Lopez-Goyne undoubtedly satisfy that test since ION had no business other than the Concession Contract.\n\nSee \u00b6 279(i) *supra*.\n\n339.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that ION contributed to the Concession, thus satisfying the first requirement under Article 10.28 of the Treaty.\n\n340.\n\nAs for the requirement of \"assumption of risk\", the Tribunal is persuaded that, contrary to Respondent's position, ION bore the risk of a failure of the project even during the time Norwood was acting as contractor. Considering that the Concession was ION's sole asset, its loss or any diminution of its value (in particular due to poor testing results) would certainly have negatively affected ION's value. This constitutes a significant operational risk.\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Respondent's suggestion that Norwood alone bore that risk, as would be demonstrated by the fact that only it, and not ION, impaired the Concession's value in its financial statements.454 The way the risk was treated by Norwood for accounting purposes does not detract from the fact that ION did run the risks of the Concession. Since, as mentioned above, Norwood was publicly listed, it was subject to reporting requirements which did not apply to ION as a closed company. Neither Norwood's involvement nor the *inter partes* risk sharing agreements between it and ION shielded ION completely from the risks arising from losses incurred in the exploration and development of the Concession, because ION remained responsible for those losses vis-\u00e0-vis Nicaragua through the entire lifespan of the Concession Contract.455 This is confirmed by the fact that Nicaragua holds ION liable for the breach of its environmental obligations, which confirms the sharing of the risk between Norwood and ION.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 254.\n\nNot only ION remained liable vis-\u00e0-vis Nicaragua, but it could not even expect to be kept indemnified by Norwood for any claim by Nicaragua for two main reasons. First, the 2005 operating agreement between ION and Norwood allocates liabilities between ION and Norwood in the proportion of their respective working interests (See Operating Agreement between Norwood and ION, August 22, 2005, **Exhibit R-7**, Article 3.1) so that ION would have been solely liable for claims falling within its scope of work. Second, ION could not expect to recoup from Norwood any losses arising from claims made by Nicaragua should Norwood go bankrupt, as it eventually did.\n\n342.\n\nMoreover, from 2011 onwards, after Norwood's bankruptcy, the relevant risk was entirely borne by ION itself. Respondent appears to implicitly acknowledge this by arguing that after Norwood's departure \"*ION searched for another company to bear the investment risk*\".**456** Given ION's lack of success in identifying a suitable or willing business partner, from 2011 until the termination of the Concession Contract ION was the only one that faced the risk of the investment.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 255. See also Rejoinder, \u00b6 242.\n\n343.\n\nFinally, there can be no discussion that the requirement of duration is satisfied, in light of the fact that a project for petroleum exploration is by definition a long-term venture.457\n\nConcession Contract, **Exhibit C-3**, Article 5.\n\n344.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that ION made an investment in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Treaty. Accordingly, considering that the Tribunal has concluded above that Claimants are shareholders of ION, Respondent's first jurisdictional objection is rejected.\n\n**IX.C Whether 10.16.1(a) of the Treaty is the proper basis for the Claim**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nRespondent's second objection to jurisdiction is predicated on the assumption that the Claim cannot be brought under the legal basis invoked by Claimants, which is Article 10.16.1(a) of the Treaty, but should instead have been brought under Article 10.16.1(b).\n\n346.\n\nThis objection was raised by Respondent only at the very last minute, in its Closing Statements at the Hearing, and only after the question of the legal basis for direct and indirect claims had been addressed in the Non-Disputing Party Submission and the Tribunal had directed the Parties to address it in their Closing Statements with the following questions:458\n\n\u2022 Question no. 1: \"*the Tribunal understands that Claimants' claim is brought under Article 10.16.1(a) of the CAFTA-DR. What kind of damages can Claimants claim thereunder? Do they include damages suffered by ION*?\"\n\n\u2022 Question no. 2: \"*the Tribunal understands that Claimants' damages calculation focuses on the damages alleged to have been suffered by ION. What is the correlation between these damages and those claimed by Claimants?*\"\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 368 ff. below.\n\n***IX.C.1 Non-Disputing Party Submission***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nThe Tribunal first wishes to refer to the Non-Disputing Party Submission, which addresses the question of the jurisdictional bases under which claims against a Treaty Party can be brought under the CAFTA-DR that is the subject of Respondent's second jurisdictional objection.\n\n348.\n\nThe United States take the position that there are two such bases, Articles 10.16.1(a) and 10.16.1(b), \"*which serve to address discrete and non-overlapping types of injury*\". Specifically, the United States argues that:\n\n[w]here the investor seeks to recover loss or damage that it incurred directly, it may bring a claim under Articles 10.16.1(a). However, where the alleged loss or damage is to '*an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly*', the investor's injury is only indirect. Such derivative claims must be brought, if at all, under Article 10.16.1(b).459\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 29.\n\n349.\n\nAccording to the United States, this follows from the structure of Article 10.16.1 of the Treaty which provides for two distinct avenues for bringing claims \u2013 lit. (a) and lit. (b) \u2013 and was purposefully drafted in that way taking into account two principles of customary international law:460 first, the principle \"*that no claim by or on behalf of a shareholder may be asserted for loss or damage suffered directly by a corporation in which that shareholder holds shares*\",461 second, the principle that \"*no international claim may be asserted against a State on behalf of the State's own nationals*\".462\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 30, referring to *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*), Judgment, November 30, 2010, I.C.J. 639, \u00b6\u00b6 155-156 and *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Ltd. (Belgium v. Spain)*, Judgment, February 5, 1970, I.C.J. 3, 35, \u00b6\u00b6 44-47.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 33.\n\n350.\n\nWhile Article 10.16.1(a) fully reflects the first principle, Article 10.16.1(b) introduces a \"*narrow and limited derogation*\" from the second of those principles of customary international law, by allowing \"*an investor of a Party that owns or controls that enterprise to submit a claim on behalf of the enterprise for loss or damage incurred by that enterprise*\". In this context, the United States conclude that, if shareholders could bring a claim on their own behalf for indirect injury under Article 10.16.1(a), the narrow exception provided for by Article 10.16.1(b) would be superfluous.463\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\n351.\n\nFinally, the United States note that it cannot be inferred from the text of Article 10.16.1(a) of the Treaty that the contracting States intended to derogate from customary international law restrictions on the assertion of shareholder claims.464\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 35.\n\n352.\n\nAs provided by CAFTA-DR Article 10.20.2, the United States' submission concerns the interpretation of the Treaty and makes no reference to the facts of the case.\n\n***IX.C.2 The Parties' positions***\n-----------------------------------\n\n***IX.C.2.a Respondent's position***\n------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's questions, Respondent only briefly addressed the issue of the legal basis of the Claim in its Closing Statements. It asserted that it is for Claimants to state \"*whether their claim is for damages allegedly suffered by ION*\" and, referring to their statement at the Hearing discussed below, argued that the Claim is brought by Claimants \"*on their own behalf, which has clear implications for jurisdiction and damages*\".465 Referring to the Non-Disputing Party Submission, Respondent states that the Claim is not permitted under the Treaty since Article 10.16.1(a) thereof only allows a shareholder to bring a claim on its own behalf for direct losses466 and does not afford an avenue for redress against indirect injuries such as the ones Claimants allege to have suffered.467.\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1374.\n\nTr. Day 6, pp. 1375-1376.\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1374. Respondent submits that \"*[i]f a shareholder seeks to claim any loss of value to their share, that claim would need to be brought under 10.16.1(b)*\" (*id.*, p. 1378).\n\n354.\n\nRespondent \"*acknowledges*\" that the tribunal in *Kappes v. Guatemala*468 found \"*that reflective losses could be brought under DR-CAFTA*\", but notes that there was a dissent on the point. Moreover, it highlights that in the present arbitration \"*we have the benefit of the submission of a Contracting State telling us precisely what the meaning and intention of Article 10.16.1 is*\".469\n\n*Daniel W. Kappes and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/43, Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, March 13, 2020, **Exhibit CLA-167**.\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1376.\n\n355.\n\nAs to the Tribunal's second question, Respondent argued that \"*any damages suffered by ION cannot be presumed to flow automatically to the Claimants*\" and alleged that the damages claim is unsupported, as Claimants have not established (*i*)\"*the existence and quantitative impact of the alleged harm to their shareholding*\", and (*ii*) *\"any value for their shares in ION prior to the termination of ION's concession*\".**470**\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1377.\n\n***IX.C.2.b Claimants' position***\n----------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nIn their Closing Statements, Claimants submitted that in the Rejoinder, Nicaragua expressly stated that it did not challenge Claimants' right to bring a claim for reflective loss.471\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1240, referring to Rejoinder, fn. 344.\n\n357.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's first question, Claimants submitted that they \"*are claiming damages suffered by them as a result of Nicaragua's measures against ION. So, it is a reflective loss claim*\".**472** They added that, in any case, the \"*plain text*\" of Article 10.16.1(a) of the Treaty makes it clear that the Treaty does not impose \"*any limitation whatsoever*\" on an investor's ability to bring reflective loss claims thereunder.473 For this interpretation, they rely on the majority's finding in *Kappes v. Guatemala* that \"*there is nothing in the Treaty that prevents you from claiming reflective loss, and the opposite is true*\".474\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1239: 18-21.\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1240.\n\nTr.- Day 6, pp. 1240-1241, summarizing *Daniel W. Kappes and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates v. Republic of Guatemala*, **Exhibit CLA-167**, \u00b6\u00b6 119, 144, 157.\n\n358.\n\nAs to the Tribunal's second question, Claimants noted that the termination of the Contract \"*caused harm to ION and, in doing so, it reduced the value of the aggregate shares of ION in the same amount of the harm. As Claimants collectively owned 58.02 percent of the shares in ION, the damages sought in this Arbitration are consistent with that percentage of ownership*\".475\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1371.\n\n***IX.C.3 The Tribunal's analysis and decision***\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nWith respect to Respondent's second objection, the Tribunal will first consider certain preliminary issues relating to whether such objection can be considered, having regard to the moment when it was raised, and then will discuss the merits of the objection.\n\n***IX.C.3.a Preliminary issues***\n---------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nGiven the timing of Respondent's second jurisdictional objection and the way it arose and was addressed, three preliminary issues ought to be considered:\n\n(i) whether the objection is belated; and\n\n(ii) whether Respondent waived its right to raise this objection, as argued by Claimants.\n\n361.\n\nAs to timeliness, Respondent raised this objection at the end of the Hearing.476 Neither the Arbitration Rules nor the ICSID Convention seem to preclude objections raised at a late stage of the proceedings. Rule 41(1) provides that any jurisdictional objection\n\nshall be made **as early as possible**. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General **no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial** [\u2026] **unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time** (emphasis added).\n\nTr. Day 6, pp. 1373:9-1376:9.\n\n362.\n\nOn the other hand, Rule 41(2) provides that:\n\nThe Tribunal **may** on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence (emphasis added).\n\n363.\n\nSimilarly, Article 41 of the ICSID Convention states that:\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence. (2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\n\n364.\n\nBy reference to these provisions, case-law and academic literature largely endorse the view that, save for fringe cases,477 pursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, tribunals must address jurisdictional objections irrespective of when they were raised.478 On this basis, considering its duty to verify that it has jurisdiction over the case presented to it, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent's objection is not time-barred.\n\n*Waguih Elie George Siag & Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 11, 2007.\n\n*AIG v. Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/6, Award, October 7, 2003. In *Vestey Group v. Venezuela* and *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*, the tribunals found the objections to be inadmissible, but considered them nonetheless (see *Vestey Group Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, April 15, 2016, \u00b6 150; *Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award, September 16, 2003, \u00b6 16.1). See also Schreuer, Malintoppi *et al*., *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 528, \u00b6 42.\n\n365.\n\nAs to the alleged waiver of the objection, Claimants suggest that, in its written submissions, Respondent asserted that it did not challenge Claimants' right to bring a reflective loss claim.479 They base this assertion on the following language in a footnote of the Rejoinder: \"*In RREEF Infrastructure, the respondent argued that shareholders could not bring a claim for the investments of companies or partnerships in which they held shares, which is not an argument Nicaragua makes in this arbitration*\".480 The Tribunal does not find this language sufficiently precise and clear to constitute a waiver of Respondent's right to raise this objection. Moreover, it is contained in a section of the Rejoinder that is concerned not with the admissibility of the Claim, but rather with the requirements of a protected investment.\n\nTr. Day 6, pp. 1239-1240.\n\nRejoinder, fn. 344.\n\n366.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal holds that it is not precluded from considering Respondent's second jurisdictional objection.\n\n***IX.C.3.b Can the Claim be brought under Article 10.16.1(a) of the Treaty?***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nAs mentioned, Respondent's objection is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claim because, in its view, it is a claim for losses suffered not directly by Claimants, but by ION, and is therefore a claim for indirect, or reflective, losses. As such, says Respondent, the Claim should not have been brought under lit. (a) of Article 10.16.1, which is the Treaty provision invoked by Claimants, but rather under lit. (b) of that Article.\n\n368.\n\nTo decide this objection, the Tribunal must address two discrete questions:\n\n\u2022 does Article 10.16.1 of the Treaty bar prospective claimants from bringing reflective loss claims under lit (a)?\n\n\u2022 is the Claim a claim for reflective or for direct losses?\n\n369.\n\nAs to the first question, Claimants maintain that indirect claims can be brought under lit. (a) because that provision does not exclude them from its ambit, while Respondent contests this. Claimants rely on the majority's decision in *Kappes v. Guatemala*, whereas Respondent relies on Prof. Zachary Douglas' Partial Dissenting Opinion in the same case (\"**Douglas Dissent**\"),481 as well as on the Non-Disputing Party Submission.\n\n*Daniel W. Kappes and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/43, Partial Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Zachary Douglas QC, March 13, 2020.\n\n370.\n\nAs to the second question, as recalled above, at the Hearing Claimants alleged that the Claim was \"*a reflective loss claim*\" and Respondent accepted that characterization.\n\n371.\n\nNeither Party engaged with the elaborate reasoning of the majority and the Douglas Dissent in *Kappes v. Guatemala* and the Non-Disputing Party Submission on the construction of Article 10.16.1, or substantiated its position on the direct or indirect nature of the Claim.\n\n372.\n\nArticle 10.16.1, lit. (a) and (b), of the Treaty provide respectively that a foreign investor can bring claims for breaches of the Treaty by the host State on its own behalf, as well as on behalf of an enterprise directly or indirectly owned or controlled by it. Article 10.16.1 reads as follows:\n\n1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:\n\n(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A.\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement;\n\nand\n\n(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out, that breach; and\n\n(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached [\u2026]\n\nand\n\n(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n373.\n\nThe relationship between the two pathways foreseen by lit (a) and (b) of Article 10.16.1 for bringing the different types of claims, and specifically whether indirect claims can be brought under lit. (a) (in addition to under lit. (b)), was analyzed extensively by the majority and by the Douglas Dissent in *Kappes v. Guatemala* by reference to that same provision of the CAFTA-DR. The majority and the minority came to opposite conclusions on the strength of an analysis according to the interpretative canons of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n374.\n\nThe majority held that those canons support the conclusion that indirect claims can be brought indifferently under both prongs of Article 10.16.1 of the Treaty.482 Conversely, the Douglas Dissent held that the second and third canons of Article 31 \u2013 context, taking into account other provisions of the Treaty (specifically Articles 10.18.2, 10.26 and Annex 10-E), as well as object and purpose \u2013 predicate that only direct claims can be brought under the first prong, lit. (a).483 The Non-Disputing Party Submission takes the same position.484\n\n*Daniel W. Kappes and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates v. Republic of Guatemala*, \u00b6 157.\n\nDouglas Dissent, \u00b6 26.\n\nSee Section IX.C.1.\n\n375.\n\nWithout prejudice to their divergence on whether Article 10.16.1(a) is available for indirect claims, both the majority and the minority in *Kappes* concurred that claims for injury to a claimant's shareholder rights, including where the assets of the investor's enterprise have been expropriated, \"*which would leave the shareholder with bare title to a stripped entity*\",485 can be brought under Article 10.16.1(a), as they are direct claims. In Professor Douglas' words,\n\n[E]ven on my reading of Article 10.16.1, the Claimants would not be precluded from pursuing their claim for the expropriation of their shares in Exmingua because such a claim is cognizable under Article 10.16.1(a) \u2013 it is a claim to vindicate their legal rights as shareholders rather than their mere economic interest in the value of Exmingua's shares.486\n\n*Daniel W. Kappes and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates v. Republic of Guatemala*, \u00b6 137.\n\nDouglas Dissent, \u00b6 28.\n\n376.\n\nThe Non-Disputing Party Submission reaches the same conclusion. At \u00b6 32, it reasons as follows:\n\nExamples of claims that would allow a shareholding investor to seek direct loss or damage include where the investor alleges that it was denied its right to a declared dividend, to vote its shares, or to share in the residual assets of the enterprise upon dissolution. Another **example of a direct loss or damage suffered by shareholders is where the disputing State wrongfully expropriates the shareholders' ownership interests** \u2013 whether directly through an expropriation of the shares or indirectly by expropriating the enterprise as a whole. (emphasis added)487\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 32.\n\n377.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced by this shared conclusion of the *Kappes* majority and the Douglas Dissent, as well as of the Non-Disputing Party Submission that the expropriation of a company directly affects its shareholders. In light of this, the Tribunal need not take a position on the debate on whether indirect claims can be brought under Article 10.16.1(a) and on the conflicting arguments of Claimants, Respondent and the Non-Disputing Party Submission. Indeed, as discussed below, in the Tribunal's judgment in this case the Claim is for expropriation and therefore for direct, and not reflective, damages.\n\n378.\n\nIt is true that, when specifically questioned on this point, Claimants took the position that the Claim was brought \"*under 10.16.1(a), and Claimants are claiming damages suffered by them as a result of Nicaragua's measures against ION. So, it is a reflective loss claim*\".488.\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1239.\n\n379.\n\nThe legal characterization of claims in order to establish the proper jurisdictional requirement for their submission to arbitration is a matter for the Tribunal. For this purpose, what is relevant is the conduct of the State that a claimant considers harmful, the legal basis invoked in support of the request for the finding that such conduct constitutes a treaty breach, and the relief sought.\n\n380.\n\nIn this case, the object of the Claim, and Nicaragua's act stigmatized by Claimants as a breach of the Treaty, is the termination of the Concession Contract,489 to which Claimants consistently refer as the \"repudiation\" of that Contract.490 Claimants' case is encapsulated in this statement at the beginning of the Memorial:\n\nThis is a straightforward case of the Nicaraguan state abusing its sovereign powers to **expropriate** a valuable hydrocarbon concession belonging to the Claimants. (emphasis added)491\n\nReply, \u00b6 301.\n\nSee in particular Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 277, 328, 390, 395, 398, 405, 409.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 4.\n\n381.\n\nIt is this alleged \"*abuse of sovereign powers to expropriate*\" their investment that Claimants deem has given rise to the breach of both of the Treaty obligations on which they hinge the Claim. In fact, although Claimants plead that Respondent breached the obligation to accord the standard of treatment of Article 10.5492 as well as the prohibition of expropriation of Article 10.7,493 both breaches are alleged to flow from the same conduct. In their words, \"*Nicaragua's repudiation of the Concession Contract sounds in two breaches of the Treaty*\".494 Despite being pled cumulatively, the two legal bases can be read in the alternative, inasmuch as each one is capable of supporting the finding of illegality under the Treaty of Respondent's conduct that is the ground for the request for compensation.\n\nReply, \u00b6 328.\n\nReply, \u00b6 390.\n\nReply, \u00b6 277. See also Reply, \u00b6 409: \"T*he Claimants have explained in* ***Section IV*** *that Nicaragua's repudiation of the Concession Contract was in breach of Articles 10.5 (MST/FET) and 10.7 (expropriation) of the Treaty*\".\n\n382.\n\nThe fact that, even though Claimants plead two distinct legal breaches, the object of the Claim is a single main conduct \u2013 the \"repudiation\" of the Contract \u2013 is demonstrated by the fact that Claimants identify only one head of damage, which is the \"destruction\" of their investments.495 Again in their words,\n\nWhatever the legal characterization of the breach (*i.e.*, MST/FET or expropriation), it deprived ION (and therefore the Claimants) of their rights under the Concession Contract and rendered the Claimants' shares in ION worthless**496**\n\nReply, \u00b6 394.\n\nReply, \u00b6 417.\n\n383.\n\nThe same concept is repeated elsewhere:\n\nthe injury caused by Nicaragua's breach is the deprivation of the contractual rights under the Concession Contract (as well as the diminution of the value of the Claimants' shares in ION, which were rendered worthless).497\n\nReply, \u00b6 410.\n\n384.\n\nThe Claim is thus unquestionably one for compensation for the deprivation of the benefits of ownership of ION. Following the termination of the Contract, which was ION's sole asset, Claimants were left as mere shareholders \"*with bare title to a stripped asset*\", as the majority in *Kappes* put it.498 As Professor Douglas characterized it in his dissent in that case, concurring on this point with the majority, this type of claim is \"*a claim to vindicate* [Claimants'] *legal rights as shareholders rather than their mere economic interest in the value of* [the expropriated entity's] *shares*\".499\n\n*Daniel W. Kappes and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates v. Republic of Guatemala*, \u00b6 137.\n\nDouglas Dissent, \u00b6 28.\n\n385.\n\nSince the Contract was ION's only asset, its termination wiped out any present or future potential value of ION's shares. Therefore, the effect of the termination of the Concession, that is the object of the Claim, is not a mere reduction in the value of ION's shares, but a complete elimination of their value.\n\n386.\n\nIt follows that, despite Claimants' hurried answer to the Tribunal's question and contrary to Respondent's characterization, the Claim is not for reflective loss, for a decrease in the value of their shareholding caused by injury to ION, but rather for direct loss. It is not by chance that Claimants right from the start submitted that *\"*[the] *Treaty breaches caused direct and substantial harm to the Claimants*\".500\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 293.\n\n387.\n\nThe direct nature of the Claim is confirmed by the relief sought. Claimants seek damages corresponding to their collective equity interest in ION, which is 58% of ION's share capital. Specifically, they claim 58.02% of the Concession's net value (according to their primary method, a DCF analysis)501 or the same percentage of the costs borne by both ION and certain Claimants with respect to the Concession (according to their alternative sunk costs quantification).502 They do not apply any of the discount factors that could come into play for the quantification of derivative claims (*e.g.* the enterprise's debt or its policy of reinvesting profits rather than paying dividends) or, even just explain why such factors should not apply to their case.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 346.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 350.\n\n388.\n\nIn sum, if properly characterized having regard to its object, which is redress for the deprivation of the benefits of ownership of ION, Claimants' Claim is for direct, and not reflective, damages. On that basis, it \"*is cognizable under Article 10.16.1(a)*\"503 and was therefore properly submitted to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\nDouglas Dissent, \u00b6 28.\n\n389.\n\nFor these reasons, also Respondent's second jurisdictional objection is dismissed.\n\n**X. L****iability**\n--------------------\n\n390.\n\nThe question for the merits is whether, as Claimants contend, Respondent breached its obligations under Article 10.5 of the Treaty, by failing to accord to Claimants the standard of treatment required by that provision, as well as under Article 10.7, by expropriating their investment.\n\n391.\n\nThese two alleged breaches will be addressed separately below in **Sections X.A** and **X.B**.\n\n**X.A The alleged breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty (MST)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n392.\n\nIn order to assess Respondent's liability for breach of the standard of treatment under Article 10.5, it is necessary to establish first the content of the standard of treatment enshrined therein (**Section X.A.1**) and then whether, considering all the relevant circumstances of the case, Respondent's termination of the Contract breached that standard (**Section X.A.2**).\n\n***X.A.1 The legal standard of protection of Article 10.5 of the Treaty***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe threshold question to establish whether Nicaragua incurred in a breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty is that of the standard of treatment of foreign investors foreseen by that provision, which is the first point of contention between the Parties.\n\n***X.A.1.a The Parties' positions***\n------------------------------------\n\n**a) Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n394.\n\nClaimants argue that Article 10.5 requires Nicaragua to accord their investment a \"fair and equitable treatment\" (FET) equivalent to the minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law (MST).504 According to Claimants, as a result of the development of customary international law over time, the two standards have merged \"*to the point that they cannot be distinguished from one another*\".505 Based on these considerations, Claimants object to Respondent's argument that the Treaty imposes a lower standard of treatment than the FET.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 249-250, and case-law mentioned in fn. 557 and 558.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 249.\n\n395.\n\nAs to the content of this alleged combined MST/FET standard, Claimants refer to *Waste Management II*, which found that the MST is breached if the State's conduct is \"*arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety*\" and that \"[i]*n applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant*\".506 Claimants contend that other tribunals recognized that the MST imposes an obligation on the State to act in good faith, in a transparent manner and to respect the investor's reasonable and legitimate expectations.507\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, **Exhibit CLA-34**, \u00b6 98.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 253-255; Reply, \u00b6 287.\n\n396.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent's assertion that \"legitimate expectations\" are not part of the MST standard is inconsistent with numerous awards and ignores that the concept stems from the principle of good faith and \"*has been recognized as one of the core elements of the FET, which forms part of the MST guaranteed under Article 10.5 of the Treaty*\".508 Moreover, Respondent's attempt to exclude the duty of transparency from MST/FET is unfounded and inconsistent with the flexibility accorded by Article 10.5.509\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 289-290.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 291-294.\n\n397.\n\nFinally, Claimants make a passing mention to the Most Favored Nation provision of Article 10.4 of the Treaty (\"**MFN**\") as a ground for invoking the FET accorded by Nicaragua to Spanish investors under the Agreement for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Nicaragua of March 16, 1994 (the \"**Spain-Nicaragua BIT**\").510 On that basis, they contend that \"*to the extent that there is any difference between MST and FET under the Treaty (and there is none [\u2026]), the Claimants would be entitled to FET*\".511\n\n**Exhibit C-172**, Article IV.1.\n\nReply, fn. 693. See also Memorial, \u00b6 232.\n\n**b) Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n398.\n\nRespondent maintains that Claimants \"*seek to apply a higher, autonomous standard*\" of treatment than the one set by Article 10.5.512 According to it, that provision does not entitle Claimants to FET, since it prescribes the higher liability threshold of MST. As to Claimants' argument on the Treaty's MFN provision, Respondent observes that Claimants offer no evidence that the Spain-Nicaragua BIT provides for the autonomous FET standard and adds that the MFN clause \"*can only work prospectively with respect to treaties concluded after DR-CAFTA*\", while the Spain-Nicaragua BIT was concluded nearly 10 years earlier.513\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 286, 289-291; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 275-278. Hence, the standard to which Claimants refer was \"*deliberately rejected by the parties to DR-CAFTA*\".\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 285.\n\n399.\n\nIn Respondent's view, the MST enshrined in Article 10.5 of the Treaty provides neither for the protection of legitimate expectations514 nor for a general and autonomous duty of transparency,515 which are not part of customary international law. It also notes that under customary international law the threshold for proving a breach of MST is high.516 Hence, in order to establish a violation of Article 10.5 of the Treaty, Claimants would have to show that the termination of the Concession Contract was \"*sufficiently egregious and shocking \u2014 a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons \u2014 so as to fall below accepted international standards*\".517\n\nRespondent refers to the decision of the International Court of Justice in *Bolivia v. Chile*, which \"*constitutes the* opinio juris *the parties to DR-CAFTA determined should inform the customary international law standard they adopted in Article 10.5*\" (Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 280-282.

The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award, June 8, 2009, **Exhibit RLA-40**, \u00b6 605. By contrast, the United States allege that arbitral awards interpreting \"autonomous\" FET provisions in other treaties, outside the context of customary international law, cannot constitute evidence of the content of the customary international law standard under Article 10.5 (Non-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 18).\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 20, relying \u2013 *inter alia* \u2013 on *Cargill Incorporated v.

The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award, June 8, 2009, **Exhibit RLA-40**, \u00b6 601.\n\n402.\n\nThe Submission also takes the position that the FET under customary international law does not give rise to independent host State obligations based on the concepts of legitimate expectations, good faith and transparency.523\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 23-26. As for good faith, the United States assert that (*i*) the principle of customary international law that *\"every treaty in force is binding on the parties to it and must be performed by them in* 'good faith'\" is not established in Section A of the Treaty, and thus claims alleging breach of the good faith principle do not fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; and that (*ii*) while good faith is one of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations, it is not in itself a source of obligation where none would otherwise exist (Non-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28).\n\n***X.A.1.c The Tribunal's analysis and decision***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nArticle 10.5 requires Contracting States to accord to foreign investments \"*treatment in accordance with customary international law*\", and specifically with \"*the minimum standard of treatment of aliens*\", in the following terms:\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide: (a) \"fair and equitable treatment\" includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world [\u2026].\n\n404.\n\nThe parameters for the interpretation of the concepts of \"*customary international law*\" and \"*minimum standard of treatment of aliens*\" referred to in Article 10.5 are elucidated as follows in Annex 10-B of the Treaty:\n\nThe Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law\" generally and as specifically referenced in Articles 10.5, 10.6, and Annex 10-C results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 10.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.\n\n405.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the relationship between \"*the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens*\", which according to Article 10.5.2 is the required standard of treatment of investors under the CAFTA-DR, and the FET standard. For Claimants, the two standards have converged. Respondent disagrees, alleging that the parties to the CAFTA-DR have chosen a standard of treatment of investments different from FET, with a higher threshold. In support of their respective positions, Claimants and Respondent rely heavily on case-law, predominantly on NAFTA, but none specifically interpreting Article 10.5 of the Treaty.\n\n406.\n\nThis divergence between the Parties raises the vexed question of the content of the MST and its relation to the FET. As highlighted by the Parties, while some tribunals have held that the FET has become part of customary international law,524 others have found that MST \"*is meant to serve as a floor, an absolute bottom, below which conduct is not accepted by the international community*\"525 and that the standard for proving a breach of the MST is particularly high.526\n\nSee, *inter alia*, *Rusoro Mining Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award, August 22, 2016, **Exhibit CLA-112**, \u00b6 520; *Merrill and Ring Forestry L.P. v.

United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Award, January, 26 2006, **Exhibit RLA-21**, \u00b6 194: \"*the threshold for finding a violation of the minimum standard of treatment still remains high [\u2026]* [T]*he Tribunal views acts that would give rise to a breach of the minimum standard of treatment prescribed by the NAFTA and customary international law as those that, weighed against the given factual context, amount to a gross denial of justice or manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable international standards*\"; *Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award, June 25, 2001, **Exhibit RLA-9**, \u00b6 367, requiring \"*showing a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards, or even subjective bad faith*\".\n\n407.\n\nBefore analyzing that case-law, it is necessary to start from the relevant Treaty provision. Indeed, as noted by prominent scholars, the starting point of any analysis of the content of the MST and its relationship with FET is the language of the applicable instrument and, in particular, the degree of linkage it establishes between FET, on the one hand, and customary international law and MST on the other.527\n\nR. Dolzer, U. Kriebaum, C. Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law*, 2022, p. 200.\n\n408.\n\nBy stating that the Parties must accord investments \"*treatment in accordance with customary law, including fair and equitable treatment*\", Article 10.5.1 of the Treaty indicates that FET is considered part of customary international law. However, in clarifying the rule of Article 10.5.1, Article 10.5.2 specifies that \"*the concept of FET*\" does not \"*require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the MST and does not create additional substantive rights*\". This can only mean that fair and equitable treatment is prescribed by Article 10.5 to the extent that standard of treatment is mandatory under the customary international law minimum standard.528\n\nOn this point, see *United Nations Conference On Trade And Development, Fair And Equitable Treatment: a sequel*, UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II, 2012, pp. 28-29: \"*An explicit link between the FET obligation and the minimum standard of treatment is used in these treaties to prevent overexpansive interpretations of the FET standard by arbitral tribunals and to further guide them by referring to an example of gross misconduct that would violate the minimum standard of treatment of aliens \u2013 denial of justice. [\u2026] from the host country perspective, linking the FET standard to the minimum standard of treatment of aliens may be seen as a progressive step, given that this will likely lead tribunals to apply a higher threshold for finding a breach of the standard, as compared with unqualified FET clauses*\".\n\n409.\n\nThis is the position of a significant body of case-law based on treaties with similar language. For example, in analyzing a treaty provision almost identical to Article 10.5 of the Treaty in the US-Oman Free Trade Agreement, the tribunal in *Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v. Oman* concluded that\n\n[a] strict \"minimum standard of treatment\" provision such as Article 10.5 [of the US\u2013Oman FTA], particularly when considered in the light of Annex 10-A in the present case, cannot be interpreted in the expansive fashion in which some autonomous fair and equitable treatment or full protection and security provisions of other treaties have been interpreted. Indeed, the language of Article 10.5.2 makes very clear that Article 10.5 does \"not require treatment in addition to or beyond\" that required by the minimum standard of the treatment of aliens under customary international law.529\n\n*Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v. Sultanate of Oman*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/33, Award, October 27, 2015, \u00b6 382.\n\n410.\n\nThis, however, begs that question of the content of the MST and of the FET obligation incorporated into it.\n\n411.\n\nIt is now broadly accepted that, in light of the evolutionary character of the concept of the international minimum standard of treatment, the high threshold test formulated almost a century ago in *Neer*530 and upheld by a number of subsequent awards, including some recent ones,531 is no longer the applicable standard. Thus, most investment tribunals have strongly rejected the idea that today a breach of the MST can only be found in the presence of the kind of \"*outrageous*\" behavior described in *Neer* and its progeny.\n\n*L. F. H. Neer and Pauline Neer (USA) v. United Mexican States* (1926), 4 RIAA 60, pp. 61-62.\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v.

United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, September 18, 2009, **Exhibit RLA-44**, \u00b6 286.\n\n412.\n\nAs explained by the *Mondev v. United States of America* tribunal:\n\nboth the substantive and procedural rights of the individual in international law have undergone considerable development. In the light of these developments it is unconvincing to confine the meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" of foreign investments to what those terms - had they been current at the time - might have meant in the 1920s when applied to the physical security of an alien. To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious.532\n\n*Mondev International Ltd v.

This has been highlighted, for instance, in *International Thunderbird*, where the tribunal held that \"[n]*otwithstanding the evolution of customary law since decisions such as Neer Claim in 1926, the threshold for finding a violation of the minimum standard of treatment still remains high*\".534 The tribunal in *Murphy v. Canada* made a similar determination, finding that the minimum standard guaranteed by Article 1105 of NAFTA is \"*set* [\u2026] *at a level which protects against egregious behavior*\".535 Also analyzing the MST in the context of Article 1105 of the NAFTA, the *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada* tribunal ruled that \"*a breach of* *Article 1105* [NAFTA] *occurs only when it is shown that an investor has been treated in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective*\" and considered that a finding that the MST has been breached \"*must be made in the light of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders*\".536 Similarly, in the already mentioned *Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v. Oman* award, the tribunal concluded that\n\n[a]lthough a number of subsequent arbitral decisions have acknowledged that with the passage of time the standard has likely advanced beyond these basic requirements [set out in the *Neer* decision], tribunals have continued to employ descriptions which emphasize the high threshold for breach.537\n\n*Rusoro Mining Ltd v.

United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, October 11, 2002, **Exhibit CLA-29**, \u00b6 127.\n\n415.\n\nEven *Waste Management II*, on which Claimants rely to define the standard of treatment they were entitled to, implies that State conduct constitutes a breach of MST if it is \"*arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic*\", or amounts to a \"*complete lack of transparency and candour*\", or \"*a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety \u2013 as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings\"*.539 The choice of words of that tribunal (and particularly the adjectives \"*gross*\" and \"*manifest*\") underscores the stringency of the standard. This approach is consistent with the growing understanding of the need to reduce the perception of an almost unfettered discretion of tribunals that may derive from a self-standing reference to fair and equitable treatment not anchored to the parameters of customary international law on the treatment of aliens.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, **Exhibit CLA-34**, \u00b6 98.\n\n416.\n\nWhilst malicious intention, willful neglect of duty or bad faith are not required elements of the MST under customary international law,540 there must be some aggravating factor such that the acts of the State in question consist of more than a minor derogation from what is deemed to be internationally acceptable.\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, October 31, 2011, **Exhibit CLA-90**, \u00b6 357 citing *The Loewen Group Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award, June 26, 2003, \u00b6 132.\n\n417.\n\nIn addition to the level of protection to which investors are entitled under the MST, the Parties disagree on which specific obligations are comprised in the MST protection of Article 10.5 of the Treaty. On the one hand, Respondent does not seem to contest Claimants' position that the MST is in principle violated by arbitrary, unreasonable and disproportionate conduct, as well as by failure to respect procedural propriety and to provide due process, if such conduct reaches a certain level of seriousness. And, indeed, there appears to be a broad consensus that the prohibition of such behavior forms part of the MST.541 Nevertheless, Respondent submits that the MST does not include the concepts of legitimate expectations and transparency.\n\nSee, *inter alia*, *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, **Exhibit CLA-34**, \u00b6 98; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Arbitral Award, January 26, 2006, **Exhibit RLA-21**, \u00b6 194; *Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v. Sultanate of Oman*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/33, Award, October 27, 2015, \u00b6 390.\n\n418.\n\nAs to legitimate expectations, Claimants argue that the MST includes an obligation for the State to respect such expectations of the investor. Respondent contests this, relying on the holding of the ICJ in *Bolivia v. Chile* that:\n\nreferences to legitimate expectations may be found in arbitral awards concerning disputes between a foreign investor and the host State that apply treaty clauses providing for fair and equitable treatment. It does not follow from such references that there exists in general international law a principle that would give rise to an obligation on the basis of what could be considered a legitimate expectation.542\n\n*Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile)*, Judgment, October 1, 2018, I.C.J. Reports 2018, **Exhibit RLA-104**, \u00b6 162.\n\n419.\n\nIn this Tribunal's view, that judgment is not apposite for the question under consideration here. That is because *Bolivia v. Chile* was a State-to-State dispute concerning Chile's alleged obligation to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea and the Court had to determine, on the basis of customary international law applicable to relations between States, what types of expectations could acquire relevance in that context. It is impossible to extrapolate anything from that finding of the Court as to the type of expectations that can arise and be protected in the completely different context of relations between a State and aliens governed by a treaty on the protection of investments. The Court's dictum dismissing the relevance of investor-State jurisprudence is to be understood simply as denying that such awards can be invoked as evidence of the existence of a rule of customary international law on legitimate expectations applicable to the relations between States. In this Tribunal's opinion, it is not dispositive in a completely different context to infer the existence of a rule of customary international rule specifically on the treatment of aliens denying effects to legitimate expectations engendered by States in the specific context of their relations with foreign investors.\n\n420.\n\nFor the Tribunal, what is more relevant is that many investment treaty tribunals have brought the concept of legitimate expectations within the purview of provisions on the treatment of aliens under the MST. Indeed, according to the case-law, the protection of the investor's legitimate expectations stems from the good faith principle in customary international law.543\n\nSee *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Arbitral Award, January 26, 2006, **Exhibit RLA-21**, \u00b6 147; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Separate Opinion of Mr. Thomas W\u00e4lde, January 26, 2006, **Exhibit CLA-133**, \u00b6 25; *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, October 31, 2011, **Exhibit CLA-90**, \u00b6 348.\n\n421.\n\nFor instance, in relation to Article 1105 of the NAFTA, the tribunal in *Waste Management II* held that:\n\n[i]n applying [the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment] it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.544\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, **Exhibit CLA-34**, \u00b6 98. That reasoning was followed by *William Ralph Clayton, William Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2009-04, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, March 17, 2015, **Exhibit CLA-146**, \u00b6\u00b6 442-445; *Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Award, June 29, 2012, **Exhibit CLA-92**, \u00b6 219. Even *Glamis Gold*, which adopted a restrictive view of the concept of MST, noted that said standard may be breached by \"*the creation by the State of objective expectations in order to induce investment and the subsequent repudiation of those expectations*\" (*Glamis Gold Ltd. v. The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award, June 8, 2009, **Exhibit RLA-40**, \u00b6 627).\n\n422.\n\nNevertheless, the requirements for a finding of a violation by a State of an investor's legitimate expectation are stringent. In accordance with the case-law, in order to establish an investor's entitlement to rely on expectations, tribunals must conduct an objective analysis of the overall context, disregarding the subjective views of the investor, and taking into account the specific facts of the case to determine whether (*i*) the State made assurances or representations that the investor relied on in making the investment, and (*ii*) the reliance on those assurances was reasonable.545\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, October 3, 2006, **Exhibit CLA-47**, \u00b6 130; *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, September 11, 2007, **Exhibit RLA-30**, \u00b6\u00b6 330-332; *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, September 5, 2008, **Exhibit CLA-66**, \u00b6 261; *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, October 31, 2011, **Exhibit CLA-90**, \u00b6\u00b6 356 ff.\n\n423.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the standard of treatment under Article 10.5 of the Treaty includes an obligation for the host State not to frustrate the investor's legitimate expectations, provided they are reasonable and objective in light of the circumstances and the State's conduct.546\n\nSee, for instance, *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, October 31, 2011, **Exhibit CLA-90**, \u00b6\u00b6 356-359, 375-377.\n\n424.\n\nAs to transparency, Claimants and Respondent disagree on whether the MST imposes on the State a self-standing duty of transparency. Respondent argues that it does not, and relies on *Cargill v. Mexico*, which held that:\n\nClaimant has not established that a general duty of transparency is included in the customary international law minimum standard of treatment owed to foreign investors *per* Article 1105 [of the NAFTA]'s requirement to afford fair and equitable treatment.547\n\n*Cargill Incorporated v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, September 11, 2009, **Exhibit RLA-44**, \u00b6 294, whose reasoning was followed by *Mercer International Inc. v. Canada*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/13, Award, February 2, 2018, **Exhibit RLA-101**, \u00b6 7.77. Respondent also mentions *Merrill and Ring Forestry L.P. v. The Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/07/1, Award, March 31, 2010, **Exhibit CLA-81**, \u00b6 208.  \nClaimants argue that these cases are inapposite because they \"*offer a cursory consideration of the issue*\" and do not undertake \"*a detailed analysis*\" (Reply, \u00b6 291). While this argument may stand for *Merril v. Canada*, where the tribunal merely noted that \"[t]*ransparency as noted was unsuccessfully linked to this concept* [of fair and equitable treatment]\", it does not for *Cargill v. Mexico* (and *Mercer v. Canada*), which clearly excluded transparency was part of the customary international law minimum standard in the context of a NAFTA provision similar to Article 10.5 of the Treaty.\n\n425.\n\nClaimants for their part refer to *Waste Management II*, which, according to them, considered \"*complete lack of transparency*\" as an example of treatment infringing the MST.548 However, that award does not support their position since it did not find transparency to be an autonomous component of the MST, but rather held that a complete lack of transparency in an administrative process might be evidence of \"*lack of due process*\", which, instead, is a component of the MST.549\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, **Exhibit CLA-34**, \u00b6 98; Reply, \u00b6 292.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, **Exhibit CLA-34**, \u00b6 98: \"*the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct [\u2026] involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\u2014as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process*\".\n\n426.\n\nThe Tribunal is likewise unconvinced by the argument that transparency constitutes a self-standing requirement of the MST due to the alleged flexibility of the standard of Article 10.5 of the Treaty.550 Even if most investment tribunals concur that the circumstances of each case must be taken into consideration to establish a violation of the MST,551 the fact that Article 10.5 of the Treaty anchors MST to customary international law implies the need to identify whether an obligation of transparency is part of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens. This position was upheld in the finding of *Glamis Gold* that \"[a]*lthough the circumstances of the case are of course relevant, the standard is not meant to vary from state to state or investor to investor*\".552\n\nReply, \u00b6 293.\n\nSee, *inter alia*, *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, **Exhibit CLA-34**, \u00b6 99; *Mondev International LTD v United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, October 11, 2002, **Exhibit CLA-29**, \u00b6 127.\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award, June 8, 2009, **Exhibit RLA-40**, \u00b6 615.\n\n427.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal cannot share Claimants' position that an obligation of transparency constitutes an autonomous requirement under the MST, although lack of transparency becomes relevant if it adversely impacts due process or propriety of process.553\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, April 30, 2004, **Exhibit CLA-34**, \u00b6 98.\n\n428.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal considers that the standard of protection of investments enshrined in Article 10.5 of the Treaty by reference to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of investments:\n\n(i) imposes a high threshold for a finding of State liability in the treatment of the investor, without however requiring that the State's conduct be outrageous according to the standard set out in *Neer* in 1926;\n\n(ii) subject to that high threshold, prohibits State conduct that is arbitrary, grossly unreasonable and disproportionate or manifestly fails to respect procedural propriety and due process;\n\n(iii) protects the investor's legitimate expectations that are reasonable and objective in light of the circumstances and the State's conduct;\n\n(iv) does not incorporate a general duty of transparency, but only sanctions lack of transparency that leads to a serious breach of due process.\n\n429.\n\nThere remains Claimants' argument that the FET standard provided for by Article IV.1 of the Spain-Nicaragua BIT \u2013 supposedly imported into the Treaty by virtue of the MFN clause of Article 10.4 of the Treaty \u2013 is applicable, should that standard be more favorable than the MST foreseen by Article 10.5.\n\n430.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent's position that the MFN clause would operate prospectively, thereby only allowing the investor to \"import\" favorable provisions of treaties concluded *after* CAFTA-DR.554 In fact, Article 10.4(1) provides that *\"*[e]*ach Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favorable than that it* ***accords****, in like circumstances, to investors of any other Party or of any non-Party*\"555 without any restriction to the MFN clause's *ratione temporis* application. Moreover, when referring to the standard of treatment that may be invoked by virtue of the MFN clause, Article 10.4 employs the present tense (*i.e.* the treatment that the host State \"*accords*\") rather than the future tense. By doing so, Article 10.4 expressly encompasses the treatment to which, at the time CAFTA-DR was concluded, investors were already entitled under preexisting investment treaties.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 285.\n\nArticle 10.4(1) (emphasis added). Article 10.4(2) of the Treaty similarly provides that: \"*Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of investors of any other Party or of any non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments*\".\n\n431.\n\nThat said, Claimants only allude to the MFN argument cursorily,556 without discussing the content of the FET standard of Article IV.1 of the Spain-Nicaragua BIT557 and much less showing that it is more favorable than the standard of Article 10.5 of the Treaty. The Tribunal need therefore not deal with this. In any case, given the Tribunal's findings in the following sections, even if Claimants were right on this point, the outcome would not change.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 232; Reply, fn. 693.\n\nThe letter of Article IV.1 of the Spain-Nicaragua BIT, which reads \"*Cada Parte Contratante garantizar\u00e1 en su territorio un tratamiento justo y equitativo a las inversiones realizadas por inversores de la otra Parte Contratante*\", provides no indication on the content of the FET standard set forth therein.\n\n***X.A.2 Whether Nicaragua failed to accord MST to Claimants' investment***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n432.\n\nHaving identified the standard of treatment to which Claimants were entitled pursuant to Article 10.5 of the Treaty, the Tribunal turns to whether Nicaragua's conduct breached that standard. Claimants' position is that Nicaragua did fall foul of its obligations under that provision by frustrating their legitimate expectations, by failing to act in a consistent, transparent and predictable manner, by violating the principle of proportionality, by acting arbitrarily and unreasonably and by failing to respect procedural propriety and due process.\n\n***X.A.2.a The Parties' positions***\n------------------------------------\n\n**a) Frustration of Claimants' legitimate expectations**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n433.\n\nClaimants maintain that Nicaragua frustrated their legitimate expectation558 that (*i*) Article 70 of Law 286 would be applied \"*in the very specific and objective circumstances set out therein*\" and that (*ii*) any dispute on the termination of the Concession Contract not falling within Article 70 would be settled in accordance with the alternative procedure set out in Article 29 of the Contract.559\n\nAccording to Claimants, legitimate expectations arise from specific legal obligations assumed by a State (*e.g.* contracts), as well from general expectations that a host State provide an appropriate investment environment (Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 260-261 and case-law cited therein). A State will also frustrate an investor's legitimate expectations \"*if it uses its legal and regulatory powers for a purpose other than that for which it was intended, to impair or deprive it of its investment*\" or if it fails to guarantee due process (Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 263-264 and case-law cited therein).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 264.\n\n434.\n\nIn response to Respondent's assertion that \"*Claimants could only have '*legitimately expected*' that they would be held to their obligations under the Concession Contract*\",560 Claimants posit that Nicaragua did not have a contractual right to terminate that Contract when it did (*i.e.* on December 2014),561 as Article 70(b) of Law 286 can only apply \"*al t\u00e9rmino de la fase de exploraci\u00f3n*\", which Claimants contend occurred in November 2012.562 Since Law 286 only foresees an exploration and an exploitation phase, following the end of the exploration phase the Contract necessarily entered the exploitation phase.563\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 297.\n\nReply, \u00b6 331. Further, \"*Regardless of the specific circumstances surrounding the Concession Contract, any investor has a legitimate expectation that a host State will not unlawfully terminate the contract that serves as the basis for the establishment of its entire investment*\" (Reply, \u00b6 335).\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1268, referring to the Letter from the MEM (Mr. Emilio Rappaccioli) to ION, November 19, 2012, **Exhibit C-18**: \"*se da por finalizado el Per\u00edodo de Exploraci\u00f3n a la fecha del vencimiento del a\u00f1o de extensi\u00f3n el d\u00eda 13 de noviembre de 2012*\".\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 265; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 311-313; Tr. Day 6, p. 1271 ff.\n\n435.\n\nLastly, they argue that, \"[g]*iven that the actions of the MEM in purporting to terminate the Concession Contract were wrongful*\", even if Nicaragua had been entitled to terminate the Contract, its \"*failure to reverse the decision to terminate was inconsistent with the Claimants' legitimate expectation that Nicaragua would exercise its contractual rights in good faith*\".564\n\nReply, \u00b6 337.\n\n**ii. Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n436.\n\nRespondent takes the position that, even if the frustration of an investor's legitimate expectations constituted a violation of the MST, no such breach occurred.565\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 296.\n\n437.\n\nIndeed, Article 70(b) of Law 286 entitled Nicaragua to terminate the Contract upon ION's failure to declare a commercial discovery after the conclusion of the exploration phase and the extensions granted to it566 and the MEM repeatedly reminded ION of that.567\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 292. According to Respondent, \"*Whether or not Nicaragua had the discretion to terminate the Contract under Article 32.1, as well, is irrelevant*\" (Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 298).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 292.\n\n438.\n\nRespondent contests Claimants' case that Nicaragua was not entitled to invoke Article 70(b) on the grounds that the Contract had entered the exploitation phase as of November 2012. Respondent says that at that point the MEM rightfully did not permit ION to move to the exploitation phase, but rather granted it an additional evaluation period to complete the procedure envisaged in Article 42 of Law 286, which is a condition for any contractor to begin exploitation. In particular, Nicaragua granted that additional extension of time to complete the Evaluation Program so as to give ION an opportunity to make a declaration of commercial discovery, thereby gaining the right to move to the exploitation phase.568 Since ION never completed that procedure, it could not have moved to exploitation.569\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 133; Tr. Day 6, pp. 1405-1409. This is also the position of Dra. Rizo (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 768:22-769:7).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 191-194.\n\n439.\n\nClaimants were therefore not entitled to expect that Nicaragua would refrain from exercising its right of termination.570 In fact, Claimants' only legitimate expectation was \"*that Nicaragua would exercise its contractual right to terminate the Contract pursuant to Article 70(b) of Law 286*\".571\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 297; Rejoinder, \u00b6 289.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 293.\n\n**b) Failure to act in a consistent, transparent and predictable manner**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n440.\n\nClaimants' position is that the duty to treat foreign investments in a consistent, transparent and predictable manner is part of a State's duty to act fairly and equitably.572 According to them, Nicaragua breached that duty, because:\n\n(i) the MEM imposed a hard 180-day deadline for ION to perform the Evaluation Program (claiming that it had been proposed by ION itself) despite the Nicaraguan President having clearly recognized \"*the need to grant concessionaires enough time to complete such evaluations by extending the exploration phases*\";573\n\n(ii) Nicaragua publicly announced its decision to terminate the Contract three months before the issuance of the Termination Letter;574\n\n(iii) between December 2014 and May 2016 \"*Nicaragua changed every aspect of its purported termination of the Concession Contract*\";575\n\n(iv) Nicaragua refused to participate in the contractually agreed dispute resolution mechanism provided by Article 29 of the Contract;576\n\n(v) Nicaragua was in talks with a third-party with the view to granting it a concession over the ION Block before the termination of the Contract.577\n\nSee Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 266-271 and case-law cited therein.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 272; Reply, \u00b6 371. In fact, Claimants note that ION \u2013 and only ION \u2013 was excluded from the benefits of Law 879.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 275.\n\nReply, \u00b6 372. See also Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 273-274.\n\nReply, \u00b6 373.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 275; Reply, \u00b6 373.\n\n**ii. Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n441.\n\nNicaragua raises the following defenses in response to these arguments:\n\n(i) the 180-day deadline was sufficient since the MEM granted ION multiple extensions to allow it to declare a commercial discovery;578\n\n(ii) there was no \"systematic\" refusal by MEM to discuss ION's plans to work with NTE on the Concession and Claimants did not prove that NTE (or any other company) would support ION;579\n\n(iii) since \"*ION never initiated a dispute resolution mechanism under Article 29*\" of the Contract, there was no \"refusal\" by Nicaragua to participate in the procedure foreseen by that provision.580\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 304; Rejoinder, \u00b6 295. As for the fact that Law 879 was not applied to ION, Respondent notes that, as explained by Dra. Rizo in her Second Expert Report, that law could not be retroactively applied to the Contract. Claimants did not submit an expert statement rebutting this point (Rejoinder, \u00b6 294).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 302. Respondent states that \"*Nicaragua was under no obligation to continue indulging Claimants' fantasies*\".\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 299. According to Respondent, the \"*mere mention of Article 29 in passing does not suffice to initiate such a mechanism*\".\n\n**c) Lack of proportionality of measures**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n442.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the termination of the Contract on the day following the expiration of the 180-day deadline to perform the Evaluation Program was a disproportionate measure if assessed against the standard set out in *Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador*, pursuant to which:\n\nany penalty the State chooses to impose must bear a proportionate relationship to the violation which is being addressed and its consequences.\n\n[\u2026] In cases where the administration wishes to impose a severe penalty, then it appears to the Tribunal that the State must be able to demonstrate (i) that sufficiently serious harm was caused by the offender; and/or (ii) that there had been a flagrant or persistent breach of the relevant contract/law, sufficient to warrant the sanction imposed; and/or (iii) that for reasons of deterrence and good governance it is appropriate that a significant penalty be imposed, even though the harm suffered in the particular instance may not have been serious.581\n\nClaimants refer to the standard adopted in *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Award, October 5, 2012, **Exhibit CLA-97**, \u00b6 416, quoted in Reply, \u00b6 368.\n\n443.\n\nClaimants contend that, even assuming that the delay in the performance of the Evaluation Program \"*was attributable to ION and not to the MEM's withdrawal of collaboration, the Termination Letter did not identify any serious breaches by the Claimants nor any serious prejudice for Nicaragua that would merit terminating the Concession Contract*\".582 Claimants rely on the fact that ION had invested considerable resources in the Concession, made a discovery with massive potential and was about to finalize a deal with NTE for the financing of further exploration. Furthermore, they plead that the extension of the duration of the exploration phase of concession contracts by Law 879 is evidence that Nicaragua did not consider ION's breach significant. In that context, the appropriate sanction would have been a lesser penalty, such as a fine.583\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 278. The fact that President Ortega had earlier recognized that concessionaires should be allowed sufficient time to evaluate the results of their exploration activity \"*only underscores the disproportionate nature of the MEM's Measures*\".\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 369-370.\n\n**ii. Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n444.\n\nRespondent argues that termination of the Contract was proportionate, as \"*the Parties had agreed to this very measure in the event the contractor did not submit a declaration of commercial discovery pursuant to Article 32.1 of the Contract*\".584 It also submits that the present case cannot be compared to *Occidental v. Ecuador* where the contract was only terminated because the investor had transferred contractual rights to a third party without authorization. Here, instead, the termination of the Contract was triggered by ION's failure to perform the most significant contractual requirement.585\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 306. Relying on *Convial Callao S.A. y CCI \u2013 Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Concesiones de Infraestructura S.A. v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/2, Award, May 21, 2013, **Exhibit RLA-70**, \u00b6 613, Respondent argues that \"*there is nothing disproportionate about Nicaragua's exercise of a right that the Parties mutually and voluntarily agreed to incorporate in the Concession Contract*\" (Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 307).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 263.\n\n**d) Arbitrary and unreasonable conduct**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**i. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n445.\n\nClaimants submit that Nicaragua's conduct was arbitrary and unreasonable,586 because it terminated the Contract \"*without any traces of a rational decision-making process*\"587 and for \"*ulterior motives*\".588 Further, \"*Nicaragua not only failed to deal fairly with Claimants, but also abused its sovereign powers to circumvent the contractually-agreed forum and unilaterally terminate the Concession Contract*\".589\n\nFor a definition of \"arbitrary\" conduct, see Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 280-281 and case-law cited therein.\n\nThe Termination Letter did not state any legal basis nor invoked any source of the MEM's authority to terminate the Contract. Nicaragua also failed to justify its actions and sew confusion about the status of the Contract for nearly two years, and then sought \"*to retroactively justify the Termination Letter through Decree 191, effectively admitting it had not been a reasoned decision in the first place*\" (Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 283-284).\n\nThat is, to award the ION Block to a third-party with whom it was already negotiating.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this would run afoul of the duty of the host State to accord Claimants fair and equitable treatment. Indeed, as held in *Swisslion v. Macedonia*, a State may breach the fair and equitable standard if it submits a dispute for adjudication without previously engaging with the investor in a fair manner and ignoring its prior commitments (see *Swisslion DOO Skopje v. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/16*, Award, July 6, 2012, **Exhibit CLA-93**, \u00b6 287, referred to in Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 282, 285).\n\n446.\n\nIn reply to Respondent's contention that, due to ION's failure to perform the Evaluation Program despite the multiple extensions granted to it, it was \"*entirely reasonable\"* for the MEM *\"not to exercise whatever additional discretion it might have had under the 2014 modifications to Law 286*\", Claimants argue that:\n\n(i) such assertion is inconsistent with the reason given to ION for denying it the benefits of Law 879, *i.e*. that such law was only applicable to concession contracts still in the exploration phase, which was no longer the case for the Contract, for which the exploration phase had expired in November 2012;590\n\n(ii) the suggestion that ION had to prove it had technical and financial support to evaluate and exploit the Concession \"*confirms that Nicaragua had ceased to operate as a good faith partner by 2014*\";591\n\n(iii) had ION been granted additional time in accordance with Law 879, it would have used it to fulfill its contractual obligations, and \"*ION's track record should have given Nicaragua* cause for optimism\".592\n\nReply, \u00b6 362.\n\nReply, \u00b6 359.\n\nReply, \u00b6 364.\n\n**ii. Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n447.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants did not show that the termination of the Concession Contract was in any way arbitrary, \"*much less manifestly arbitrary, as required by Article 10.5*\".593\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 310.\n\n448.\n\nFor a start, the termination was reasonable, given that ION failed to declare a commercial discovery despite being granted multiple extensions,594 and the process was conducted in accordance with Nicaraguan law.595\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 295.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 309.\n\n449.\n\nFurther, given ION's record, the MEM's decision \"*not to exercise whatever additional discretion it might have had under the 2014 modifications to Law 286, when Claimants offered no evidence that they would be able to use the extra time to fulfill their contractual obligations*\" was \"*entirely reasonable*\".596 Respondent rejects Claimants' argument that ION's track record should have given Nicaragua cause for optimism. This would in any case be immaterial, as the Contract \"*did not grant ION an indefinite period to obtain the technical and financial capacity required to fulfill its obligations*\".597\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 305. Further, Respondent argues that Law 879 could not be retroactively applied to the Concession.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 296, 297.\n\n450.\n\nFinally, contrary to Claimants' assertions, Nicaragua's conduct is in no way similar to that of Macedonia in the *Swisslion* case. Nicaragua repeatedly informed Claimants of their failure to carry out their contractual obligations;598 in fact \"[o]*nly ION can be blamed for its failure and inability to redress those concerns and declare a commercial discovery*\".599\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 311-312.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 313.\n\n**e) Failure to respect procedural propriety and to provide due process**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n451.\n\nClaimants allege that Nicaragua had decided already in September 2014 that it would terminate the Contract.600 It \"*just waited for the 180-day deadline that it had imposed on ION to elapse to formalize its preordained conclusion*\", leaving ION no chance \"*to escape its fate*\".601 In their view, the termination of the Contract was not only substantially wrongful (as the Contract could not be terminated according to Article 70(b)), but also fraught with procedural irregularities.602\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 290.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 291.\n\nTr. Day 1, p. 74 ff.; Memorial, \u00b6 290.\n\n452.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the MEM did not have the power to terminate the Contract, as it sought to do with the Termination Letter, since it could only do so with the authorization of the President.603\n\nReply, \u00b6 304; Tr. Day 1, pp. 74-75.\n\n453.\n\nFurthermore, the MEM refused to engage in any constructive dialogue with ION and issued a Termination Letter that, according to Minister Mansell's own admission,604 did not respect due process and therefore \"*did not meet basic formal and substance requirements to qualify as an administrative act*\".605 Even the qualification given by the MEM to the Termination Letter is controversial, because, according to Claimants,\n\nwhile the February 2015 letter treated the 2014 Termination Letter like an administrative act, in the March 2015 decision, only weeks later, the MEM is saying that the 2014 Termination Letter was, in fact, not an administrative act.606\n\nLetter from the MEM (Mr. Salvador Mansell) to ION, March 25, 2015, **Exhibit C-40**.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 292.\n\nTr. Day 1, p. 77.\n\n454.\n\nClaimants posit that the MEM itself recognized the invalidity of the termination, and Decree 191 was issued as a \"*poorly disguised attempt to retroactively validate the 2014 Termination Letter*\".607 However, notwithstanding Respondent's portrayal of Decree 191 as a mere implementation of the termination put in motion in 2014 through the Termination Letter, the Decree invoked a new ground for termination,608 Article 70(e) of Law 286.609\n\nTr. Day 1, p. 78.\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1304 (\"*If, as we are told, this decree was simply implementing the 2014 termination, it follows that no new termination grounds could be incorporated, however groundless they were in this case*\"). See also Reply, \u00b6 320.\n\n455.\n\nMoreover, Nicaragua's conduct in the 18 months during which the status of the Contract remained unclear \"*violated basic requirements of due process*\".610 Not only was ION not given an opportunity to be heard and to explain why the termination was unlawful.611 Nicaragua also ignored ION's requests to resort to the dispute settlement procedure of Article 29 of the Contract which, contrary to Dra. Rizo's assessment, was available to ION.612\n\nReply, \u00b6 343.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 344-345.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 350-354.\n\n456.\n\nAs a whole, according to Claimants, \"*Nicaragua's conduct deprived ION of the ability to manage its business and engage in rational decision-making over an 18-month period*\" in which ION faced significant potential exposure to Nicaragua and to third parties, pending the formal termination of the Contract.613\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 346-347.\n\n457.\n\nClaimants highlight that Respondent \"*has not even attempted to justify the 18-month delay in 'formally' terminating the contract*\"614 and note that, even if Nicaragua had the right to terminate the Contract, \"*the manner in which Nicaragua chooses to exercise those rights must also comply with the standard of treatment that Nicaragua guaranteed in the Treaty. It plainly did not*\".615\n\nReply, \u00b6 348.\n\nReply, \u00b6 349.\n\n**ii. Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n458.\n\nRespondent disagrees that Nicaragua did not guarantee Claimants' due process.\n\n459.\n\nFirst, Minister Mansell never admitted that the Termination Letter did not meet basic formal and due process requirements. Rather, he clarified that the letter was a notification and that \"*further steps to implement the termination, as required by Nicaraguan law, would follow suit*\".616\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 308.\n\n460.\n\nFurther, the MEM was entitled to issue the Termination Letter: as the agency responsible for the administration of the Contract, it was standard practice for the MEM to formally notify to ION the grounds for termination.617 The termination was later formalized first by the decree of the President of Nicaragua and then by the Attorney General whom he had designated, as foreseen by Nicaraguan law.618\n\nTr. Day 1, pp. 267-268. See also RER-Rizo I, \u00b6 49: \"*no puede confundirse la potestad conferida al Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica para aprobar ciertos aspectos del Contrato, tales como su firma, su negociaci\u00f3n o su modificaci\u00f3n seg\u00fan lo establecido en el art\u00edculo 24 de la Ley No. 286, con la potestad de notificar la ocurrencia de una causal de terminaci\u00f3n de un contrato de concesi\u00f3n con efectos inmediatos de los previstos en el art\u00edculo 70 de la Ley No. 286. Tal como se ha mencionado, el MEM es quien tiene la potestad de supervisar el cumplimiento de las obligaciones de los contratos de exploraci\u00f3n y explotaci\u00f3n; por lo tanto, tiene la potestad de notificar un incumplimiento cuya consecuencia necesaria es la terminaci\u00f3n de dicho contrato, sin necesidad de previa autorizaci\u00f3n del Presidente*\".\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 309.\n\n461.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Decree 191 identified Article 70(e) of Law 286 as an additional basis for termination was \"*entirely appropriate*\". Respondent takes the position that only after the termination under Article 70(b) could MEM and MARENA determine that Article 70(e) provided an additional basis for termination, since ION's failure to perform the remediation activities required after the termination of the Contract was established by an inspection carried out on January 27, 2015, following the termination.619\n\nTr. Day 6, pp. 1418, 1424.\n\n462.\n\nAlso, it is not true that Nicaragua ignored Claimants' attempt to invoke the dispute resolution mechanism of Article 29 of the Contract, as ION failed properly to initiate that procedure.620\n\nSee \u00b6 441(iii) *supra.*\n\n463.\n\nAdditionally, Nicaragua regularly expressed to ION its concerns regarding its failure to perform its contractual obligations, underscoring the consequences of such failure. ION was notified of every step of the termination process and \"*had ample opportunities to challenge each one of* MEM's *and the Attorney General's Office's actions. [\u2026] ION time and again failed to avail itself of the legal mechanisms available to it*\".621 Against this background, Claimants cannot assert they were denied their right to be heard.622 Further, Claimants are barred from challenging the termination for breach of MST, due to their failure to avail themselves of the legal avenues provided by the Contract's legal framework.623\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 302.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 303.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 304.\n\n464.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that Claimants cannot \"*conjure a treaty violation by complaining that the termination procedure took too long*\", as \"*the 18-month period that Nicaragua took to finalize the termination procedure was consistent with the time that the State has taken to terminate other hydrocarbon concession contracts*\" and \u2013 generally speaking \u2013 with termination processes involving the government.624\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 305-306.\n\n***X.A.2.b The Tribunal's analysis and decision***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nBefore analyzing Claimants' claim that Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the Treaty, the Tribunal considers it useful to address three issues that are relevant for the decision of that matter, and which, as will be seen in due course, are also relevant for the decision on the claim for expropriation.\n\n466.\n\nThese issues are the following: (*i*) did Nicaragua terminate the Concession in the exercise of its contractual rights or of its sovereign authority? (*ii*) was Nicaragua entitled to terminate the Contract? and (*iii*) was the Contract terminated in compliance with the relevant legal framework? These questions are examined below in **Sections a)**, **b)** and **c)** respectively.\n\n**a) Whether Nicaragua terminated the Concession in the exercise of its contractual rights or of its sovereign authority**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n467.\n\nThe first issue to be tackled for the assessment of the alleged breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty (which, as will be seen below, is also particularly relevant for the alleged breach of Article 10.7) is whether Nicaragua terminated the Concession Contract in the exercise of its rights thereunder or of its sovereign powers.\n\n468.\n\nAs noted above, Claimants argue that, under the legal framework governing the Concession, the role of Nicaragua was that of a regulator rather than of a contractual partner.625 Claimants point to the following circumstances which, in their submission, are evidence that Nicaragua acted in the exercise of its sovereign authority in respect of the Contract:\n\n(i) in November 2013, the MEM imposed on ION the 180-day deadline for the evaluation of its commercial discovery despite the fact that neither Law 286 nor the Contract provided for such a deadline;626\n\n(ii) in December 2013,627 the MEM \"*unilaterally amended the Concession Contract in practice by introducing a new* 'intermediate' *phase*\";\n\n(iii) Nicaragua terminated the Contract by legislative decree, \"*a classic example of a sovereign act*\";\n\n(iv) Nicaragua sought to grant third parties a concession over the ION Block.628\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 384-386. First, the Contract \"*is a contract between a private company and a State for the exploration and exploitation of that State's natural resources (i.e., hydrocarbons), which was entered into to give effect to Nicaragua's sovereign objectives as memorialized in Law 286*\". Second, \"[b]*y law, the President of Nicaragua is the party to contracts entered into pursuant to Law 286, including the Concession Contract, and maintains ultimate decision-making control over all important decisions*\".\n\nClaimants refer to Letter from the MEM (Ms. Lorena Lanza) to ION, November 20, 2013, **Exhibit C-131**, p. 3, in which they say that \"*the MEM openly admitted that it was acting pursuant to its regulatory powers during that* 'intermediate phase' *when it purported to impose the 180-day period for evaluating the hydrocarbon discovery on ION*\", Reply, \u00b6 386.\n\nReply, \u00b6 386, citing December 2013 Resolution, December 19, 2013, **Exhibit C-26**.\n\nReply, \u00b6 386.\n\n469.\n\nRespondent replies that the grounds invoked by Nicaragua for terminating the Contract are \"*the very* [ones] *upon which the Contract entitled Nicaragua to terminate it*\".629 It adds that the wording of Decree 191 confirms that the Contract was terminated in accordance with Nicaragua's contractual rights.630\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 280-281; Rejoinder, \u00b6 268.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 268.\n\n470.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that Nicaragua's actions in relation to the Concession can be characterized as an exercise of sovereign authority.\n\n471.\n\n*First*, the fact that the State was a party to the Contract is not conclusive for the assessment of the capacity in which Nicaragua entered into the Contract and acted in relation to it. As also noted by the case-law quoted by Respondent, it is well established that sovereign States can act in their capacity as contractual counterparties when concluding and performing contracts.631 In this case, the assumption of the role of contracting party by the State is consistent with the nature and object of the Contract, which related to the exploration and exploitation of national resources and, which, like all concession contracts, was required by Nicaraguan law to be concluded by the President of Nicaragua.632 *Second*, the MEM's decision of November 20, 2013 to reject ION's request for review of the First Termination633 and Minister Rappaccioli's reversal of the First Termination and reinstatement of the Contract of December 19, 2013634 cannot be characterized as an exercise of sovereign authority. In both cases, the MEM adopted its decisions by reference to contractual clauses or provisions of Law 286 which had been incorporated into the Contract.635\n\nSee *Swisslion Doo Skopje v. Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia*, ICISD Case No. ARB/09/16, Award, July 6, 2012, **Exhibit CLA-93**, \u00b6 286, quoted in Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 314.\n\nSee Article 18 of Law 286.\n\nSee \u00b6 184 *supra*.\n\nSee \u00b6 187 *supra*.\n\nSee Letter from the MEM (Ms. Lorena Lanza) to ION, November 20, 2013, **Exhibit C-131**, making reference to Article 11 of the Contract and Article 42 of Law 286. See December 2013 Resolution, December 19, 2013, **Exhibit C-26**, making reference to Articles 42, 44 and 51 of Law 286, Article 14 of the Contract.\n\n472.\n\nIn any case, even if it were held that on some occasions the MEM did exercise its regulatory powers in relation to the Concession, what is relevant for the purposes of the Claim is that in terminating the Contract, and taking the action alleged by Claimants to constitute a Treaty violation, Nicaragua purported to exercise its contractual rights under Article 32.1 of the Contract.636 This is confirmed in the Termination Letter, Decree 191 and the Termination Decision, all of which only referred to the grounds for termination enshrined in Article 70 of Law 296, which Article 32.1 incorporates by reference. The fact that the termination of the Contract was accomplished by virtue of an order by legislative decree to Nicaragua's Attorney General is simply a reflection of the relevant legal framework; it does not undermine the fact that Nicaragua exercised the contractual right to terminate the Contract unilaterally, much like ION could have done in other circumstances.637\n\nA similar conclusion was reached in *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, InterAgua Servicios Integrales del Agua v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Liability, July 30, 2010, **Exhibit RLA-49**, \u00b6 143: \"*While Argentina exercised its public authority on various occasions during the crisis, the Tribunal does not consider that the Province's termination of the Concession Contract was an exercise of such authority. Rather, its actions were taken according to the rights it claimed under the Concession Contract and the legal framework*\".\n\nSee Article 32.5 of the Contract.\n\n473.\n\nFurther, there is no evidence for Claimants' insinuation that the termination was the result of a hidden political agenda638 to grant a concession over the ION Block to third parties.\n\nAs argued by Claimants in their Closing Statements (see Tr. Day 6, pp. 1330:18 \u2013 1331:9, 1337:1-4).\n\n474.\n\nTo recall, the MEM and Petronic639 engaged in conversations with potential investors, some of which were interested in the ION Block. The conversations between Petronic and EastSiberian, a company run by Mr. Graeme Phipps, a former Norwood director, started in mid-2014.640 Mr. Phipps sent a letter to Petronic confirming that its priority was the ION Block and Petronic requested due diligence material from EastSiberian.641 Further, on January 15, 2015, Petronic signed a cooperation agreement and heads of joint operating agreement with EastSiberian which included the ION Block and announced it publicly on March 19, 2015.642 On October 28, 2015, EastSiberian announced that it had been granted contractor status by Nicaragua.643 Finally, on May 16, 2016, Petronic signed a cooperation agreement and heads of joint operating agreement with PAO, to which EastSiberian sold its interests in Nicaragua on August 26, 2016.644 This notwithstanding, Claimants have not proven that these conversations impacted on ION's prospects of finding funders or investors willing to acquire an interest in the ION Block, nor that they were the cause of the MEM's decision to terminate the Contract. In fact, in the Tribunal's view, the only relevant contact between the MEM and third parties allegedly interested in exploiting the Concession was the granting of contractor status to EastSiberian which, however, occurred when the process for the termination of the Contract was well underway and it was normal that Nicaragua would look for another potential contractor for the ION Block. In any event, it is undisputed that to this day no third party has been granted a concession over the ION Block.\n\nMinister Rappaccioli was a member of Petronic's board of directors. See Minutes of Petronic Board of Directors' Meeting of January 9, 2015, **Exhibit C-233**.\n\nRWS-Lanza I, \u00b6\u00b6 37-40; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 135-141.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 157-158, \u00b6166; **Exhibits C-218** and **C-219, C-222** to **C-226**.\n\nReply, \u00b6 191; **Exhibits C-231** and **C-232** cited in Reply, fn. 441 and 442.

This is relevant because the core of Claimants' position on the breach of MST is premised on the alleged illegality of the termination of the Contract.645\n\nThe facts relevant for the termination and the proceeding that led to it are set out in Section VI.J.\n\n477.\n\nAs set forth in Decree 191 and the ensuing Termination Decision, in terminating the Contract, Nicaragua purported to exercise its rights pursuant to Articles 70(b) and 70(e) of Law 286,646 both of which are incorporated in Article 32.1 of the Contract.\n\nTermination Decision, May 24, 2016, **Exhibit C-55.**\n\n478.\n\nArticle 70(b) of Law 286 provides that:\n\nLos contratos terminar\u00e1n sin requisito previo en los siguientes casos: [\u2026] (b) Al t\u00e9rmino de la fase de exploraci\u00f3n, sin que el contratista haya hecho declaraci\u00f3n de descubrimiento comercial y no est\u00e9 vigente un per\u00edodo de retenci\u00f3n.\n\n479.\n\nAs acknowledged by both Parties,647 under this provision, Nicaragua was expressly entitled to unilaterally terminate the Contract *ipso iure* if ION failed to make a commercial discovery pursuant to Article 42 of Law 286 by the end of the exploration phase.\n\nReply, \u00b6 34; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 280-281.\n\n480.\n\nIt is undisputed that in the instant case ION did not make a declaration of commercial discovery as required by the Contract and Nicaraguan Law.648 There is instead a dispute as to whether the status of the Contract allowed Nicaragua to invoke Article 70(b) as of December 2014. Claimants suggest that it did not, since the exploration phase had ended in November 2012649 and since Law 286 only foresees an exploration and an exploitation phase, following the end of the exploration phase the Contract necessarily entered the exploitation phase.650 On the other hand, Respondent asserts that, as of November 2012, the Contract entered an evaluation phase, during which ION had to undergo the procedure envisaged in Article 42 of Law 286 in order to prove that its discovery was commercial, which would have allowed it to move to the exploitation phase.651 Both Parties agree that ION never completed such procedure.\n\nReply, \u00b6 442.\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1268, referring to Letter from the MEM (Mr. Emilio Rappaccioli) to ION, November 19, 2012, **Exhibit C-18**: \"*se da por finalizado el Per\u00edodo de Exploraci\u00f3n a la fecha del vencimiento del a\u00f1o de extensi\u00f3n el d\u00eda 13 de noviembre de 2012*\".\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1271 ff.\n\nTr. Day 6, pp. 1405-1409. This is also the position of Dra. Rizo (see Tr. Day 3, pp. 768:22-769:7).\n\n481.\n\nIt is correct \u2013 as underscored by Claimants and recognized at the Hearing by Respondent's Nicaraguan law expert, Dra. Rizo,652 and its witness, Ms. Artiles,653 who was in charge of monitoring the Contract \u2013 that Law 286 only provides for two phases, exploration and exploitation, and does not provide for an \"evaluation phase\".654 Indeed, Dra. Rizo and Ms. Artiles said that, under normal circumstances, the Evaluation Program should have been completed during the exploration phase.655 From this, however, it does not follow that simply by declaring \"*un descubrimiento significante que puede convertirse en comercial*\"656 at the end of the exploration phase (the six-year duration of which had been extended several times to approximately ten years),657 ION could without more enter the exploitation phase. The discussion between the Parties on this point arises in large part because the situation that presented itself with the performance of the Contract was not foreseen by Law 286. In fact, the Law seemed to assume that the discovery would be made sufficiently in advance of the end of the exploration phase to leave time for the 180-day evaluation process provided for in Article 42(d) of Law 286 so that, in case of successful completion of said process, contractors could make a declaration of a commercial discovery and transition directly to the exploitation phase at the end of the exploration phase. In the case at hand, however, since ION only announced its purported \"*descubrimiento*\" at the very last moment of the exploration phase, there was no time left for the evaluation to take place before the end of that phase.\n\nTr.

Day 3, p. 690:2-9 (Ms. Artiles).\n\nION Declaration of Discovery, November 6, 2012, **Exhibit C-16.** See \u00b6 160 *supra*.\n\nThe Contract was first extended for one year in early 2009, upon request by Norwood (see \u00b6 135 *supra*). ION was then granted a one-year extension under Article 36 of Law 286 on November 14, 2011 (see \u00b6 143 *supra*). Afterwards, ION was granted two 180-day extensions to undergo the evaluation procedure under Article 42(c) of Law 286: the first one on November 19, 2012, after ION's purported declaration of discovery (see,\u00b6 164 *supra*), and the second one on December 19, 2013, when the First Termination was reversed (see \u00b6 187 *supra*).\n\n482.\n\nBoth Law 286 and the Contract were clear in requiring a \"declaration of commercial discovery\" pursuant to Article 42(d) of Law 286 as a condition for entering the exploitation phase.658 Since it is common ground that ION never performed the evaluation required by said provision nor established the existence of commercial reserves,659 the MEM was unquestionably entitled to terminate the Contract already in November 2012 on the ground provided by Article 70(b) of Law 286, as even Claimants admit.660 Nevertheless, at that time, the MEM decided not to avail itself of its right to terminate and, in its discretion, granted ION 180 days to complete an evaluation program (*i.e.* the same period foreseen for such a program under Article 42(d) of Law 286) and to confirm that its discovery was indeed commercial.661 In these circumstances, and particularly in light of the clear requirement that contractors complete the procedure envisaged in Article 42 of Law 286 to prove a commercial discovery before moving to the exploitation phase, it is unsustainable that ION was entitled to continue directly with the exploitation of the Concession Area without completing the Evaluation Program and proving the existence of a commercial discovery.\n\nSee Article 45 of Law 286 and Article 5 of the Contract.\n\nThe fact that ION did not satisfy that necessary condition to move to exploitation is also dispositive of Claimants' argument that ION being requested to relinquish all the areas of the Concession except for the \"*exploitation areas*\" would imply that it had moved to the exploitation phase (see Tr. Day 6, p. 1268:17-22).\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1285: \"*Now, at that stage, November 2012, the 6-year-plus-1 of the exploration period had expired, and the MEM then had two options. Option 1 was to terminate ION's Concession under Article 70(b) precisely for not declaring commerciality under Article 42(b)*\".\n\nSee Section VI.G *supra*.\n\n483.\n\nIt is equally unsustainable that Nicaragua acted wrongfully by granting ION a 180-day period to carry out the evaluation needed to confirm the commercial nature of the discovery because that was not foreseen by the law. In so doing, Nicaragua chose not to exercise its right to terminate the Contract at that moment so as to give ION an opportunity to satisfy the inescapable condition for the passage to the subsequent phase. By such indulgence, which was clearly in ION's interest, Nicaragua certainly cannot be understood to have forfeited its right to terminate the Contract pursuant to Article 70(b) of Law 286 if the condition was ultimately not satisfied.\n\n484.\n\nThere is a serious paradox inherent in Claimants' position that, by not terminating the Contract upon the end of the exploration phase despite the lack of a declaration of commercial discovery, Nicaragua waived its right to invoke the lack of compliance with that condition and to terminate the Contract under Article 70(b). Indeed, that position would imply that, by automatically entering the exploitation phase without having demonstrated the existence of a commercial discovery, ION would have acquired the right to \"exploit\" the Concession Area for 35 years, with no possibility for Nicaragua to oust it. This is unsustainable.\n\n485.\n\nClaimants' remark that \"*Nicaragua could still seek to terminate the concession pursuant to the process set out in Article 32.3* [of the Contract]\"662 is meritless. In fact, the dispute resolution procedure of Article 32.3 of the Contract was only applicable for breaches not falling under Article 70 of Law 286. Accordingly, it would not have permitted Nicaragua to terminate the Contract on the ground of ION's failure to make a commercial discovery, which was the core condition that ION had to satisfy for the right to exploit the Concession, and with which it did not comply.\n\nTr. Day 6, p. 1288.\n\n486.\n\nClaimants submit that the MEM's letter of November 19, 2012663 established that the Contract was entering into the exploitation phase. This does not follow from the text of that letter. To recall, that letter simply acknowledged that the exploration phase had finished on November 13, 2012 and that the Contract was in an *\"evaluation phase*\" considered to be an *\"intermediate phase\" \"between exploration and exploitation\"* that could *\"take place once finalized the exploration phase (six years plus a one year extension) as occurs in the present case\".*664\n\nLetter from the MEM (Mr. Emilio Rappaccioli) to ION, November 19, 2012, **Exhibit C-18**.\n\n*Ibid*., pp. 3-4.\n\n487.\n\nWhile in that letter, Minister Rappaccioli did declare that the exploration phase had expired,665 he did not say that the Contract had entered the exploitation phase. Rather, the Minister simply said that, since ION's declaration of discovery had been made at the end of the exploration period, he granted ION a further deadline to complete the evaluation procedure under Article 42 in order to establish whether a commercial discovery had been made,666 which was the condition to be satisfied for a concession contract to move to the exploitation phase. That statement can only be reasonably interpreted as indicating that, after the expiration of that deadline, ION would be allowed to perform the Evaluation Program. It cannot be read as an assurance that Nicaragua would not terminate the Contract should ION continue to fail to prove the existence of a commercial discovery as required by Article 42, which is what ultimately happened. The Tribunal likewise sees no basis for Claimants' argument based on the MEM's refusal to apply Law 879 to ION. To recall, Law 879 amended Articles 36 and 45 of Law 286 to allow the MEM to extend the exploration period by up to six years.667 When ION requested the application of that law to the Contract, Minister Rappaccioli refused on the grounds that ION was no longer in the exploration phase.668 According to Claimants, this would be an indication that ION had entered the exploitation phase.669 The Tribunal finds this argument untenable, as Law 879 did not purport to amend Article 42 of Law 286 requiring the completion of the procedure enshrined therein to enter the exploitation phase.\n\n*Id.*: \"*Primero: [\u2026] se da por finalizado el Per\u00edodo de Exploraci\u00f3n a la fecha del vencimiento del a\u00f1o de extensi\u00f3n el d\u00eda 13 de noviembre del 2012.

[\u2026] El Ing. Rappaccioli expone que si la empresa quiere seguir invirtiendo y est\u00e1n conscientes que los riesgos son de ellos; \"pues sigan adelante.\"670\n\nExecutive Report, ION-MEM, Minutes of Meeting of November 13, 2012, **Exhibit R-62**, pp. 3-4.\n\n489.\n\nThat statement, however, is very generic. If Minister Rappaccioli's words are read in context, together with the statements of the other representatives of the MEM671 and the MEM's communication of November 19, 2012, it is doubtful that they can be interpreted as Claimants allege.\n\nEspecially Ms. Lanza, who made it clear to ION's representatives that \"*no pueden pasar a la etapa de Explotaci\u00f3n sin haber agotado las actividades de perforaci\u00f3n y demostrar que el yacimiento es comercialmente viable*\" (*ibid*.).\n\n490.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal is satisfied that, under Nicaraguan law, Nicaragua was entitled to terminate the Contract pursuant to the first one of the provisions invoked by it, Article 70(b) of Law 286, incorporated in Article 32.1 of the Contract.\n\n491.\n\nThe conclusion that Nicaragua was rightfully entitled to terminate the Contract in accordance with the first ground for termination invoked by it, renders moot Claimants' argument that the second ground for termination invoked by Nicaragua, Article 70(e)3 of Law 286, could not be relied upon in the circumstances.672 The Tribunal will accordingly not discuss it.\n\nSee \u00b6 454 *supra.*\n\n**c) Whether the termination of the Contract complied with the applicable procedural rules**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n492.\n\nThe third preliminary matter to be addressed is whether Nicaragua's termination of the Contract complied with the applicable procedures. This is relevant because one of the arguments on which Claimants base their claim of violation of the MST is that the termination of the Contract was fraught with procedural irregularities that breached due process.\n\n493.\n\nThe answer is not straightforward. As explained by Dra. Rizo in her expert report and cross-examination, Law 286 does not set forth a procedure for the unilateral termination of a concession contract by the State,673 since ION was the first concession holder to make a declaration of alleged discovery.674\n\nTr. Day 3, p. 793; RER-Rizo I, \u00b6 47.\n\nTr. Day 3, p. 764:8-10.\n\n494.\n\nConsequently, according to Dra. Rizo, the termination was governed by the general rules of Nicaraguan law.675 In the expert's view, Nicaragua respected these provisions, since (*i*) it notified ION of the termination through the Termination Letter, (*ii*) it issued Decree 191, authorizing the Attorney General to proceed with the formal termination, and (*iii*) it formalized the termination with the Termination Decision.676\n\nTr. Day 3, p. 793:14-17; RER-Rizo I, \u00b6 47; RER-Rizo II, \u00b6 29.\n\nTr. Day 3, p. 793:16-17; RER-Rizo I, \u00b6\u00b6 48-51.\n\n495.\n\nClaimants do not offer an alternative version of the procedure that should have been followed for the termination of the Concession, nor do they provide evidence from an expert of Nicaraguan law to contest Dra. Rizo's opinion on the point. Nonetheless, their position that the termination process incurred in inconsistencies appears to have some merit.\n\n496.\n\nWhen Nicaragua decided to terminate the Contract, it did so through a 18-month process characterized by certain inconsistencies and procedural irregularities. It is beyond dispute that ION repeatedly failed to perform the Evaluation Program in spite of the numerous *de facto* extensions that were given by the MEM, and that it was unable to obtain the necessary monetary and technical resources. However, and setting aside the issue of whether this behavior rises to a breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty (which the Tribunal will analyze below), Nicaragua acted somewhat inconsistently during the termination process.\n\n497.\n\nClaimants submit that the issuance of the Termination Letter was not preceded by an administrative proceeding and that during the document production phase Nicaragua did not produce any evidence of that it had occurred677 and in a letter dated March 25, 2015, the MEM actually recognized that no such proceeding had taken place. However, the Tribunal can find no evidence that Article 70 required the MEM to follow administrative proceedings *before* putting the concessionaire on notice of its decision to terminate. The text of the provision suggests the contrary.\n\nReply, \u00b6 186 and fn. 420.\n\n498.\n\nAdditionally, it is unclear whether the MEM had the authority to terminate the Contract itself or whether the termination required a Presidential Decree. The latter seems to be suggested by Minister Mansell's March 25, 2015 letter stating that the Termination Letter was not an administrative resolution or act, and was only meant to notify ION of the MEM's intention to terminate the Contract, and thus would be followed by \"[una] *resoluci\u00f3n administrativa que en su momento deber\u00e1n emitir* ***los funcionarios competentes de este Ministerio,*** *con el fin de* ***cumplir con el sumario administrativo y el debido proceso****.\"*678 Moreover, on October 27, 2015, the Attorney General of Nicaragua sent a letter to President Ortega's secretary requesting the President's authorization to initiate and execute the termination process of the Contract.679 This letter could suggest that the Attorney General was not satisfied that the MEM had the authority to terminate the Contract. Minister Mansell's letter of March 25, 2015 cited in the Termination Decision \u2013 had stated that the Termination Letter and the MEM's letter of February 16, 2015 were not administrative acts and, on that basis, rejected ION's administrative appeal and ION's referral to arbitration under the Contract. The subsequent administrative procedure referred to in Minister Mansell's letter could be interpreted to be the procedure for termination that Dra. Rizo suggested in her expert report and at the Hearing.680\n\nMEM letter dated March 25, 2015, **Exhibit C-40.** Emphasis added**.**\n\nLetter from the Attorney General to Mr. Oquist dated October 27, 2015, **Exhibit C-243.**\n\nSee \u00b6 494 *supra*.\n\n499.\n\nAlthough the above referred matters lost relevance in the light of Decree 191 and the Termination Decision, they indicate that the termination process was not entirely flawless and transparent. Whether this caused confusion to the detriment of due process and procedural propriety in breach of the high standard of Article 10.5 of the Treaty will be discussed below.\n\n**d) Whether Nicaragua breached Article 10.5 of the Treaty by failing to grant the minimum standard of protection**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n500.\n\nHaving addressed the foregoing preliminary questions and identified the standard of treatment under Article 10.5, the Tribunal may now proceed to analyze whether, considering all the relevant circumstances, Respondent breached that standard in terminating the Contract.\n\n501.\n\nClaimants' grievances, which are described in detail above,681 can be summarized as follows. First, they argue that Nicaragua was not entitled to terminate the Contract under Article 70(b) of the Contract, as that ground should have been invoked at the end of the exploration phase of the Contract, *i.e.* in November 2012, and was only invoked more than one year later. According to Claimants, the invocation of such ground was merely a pretext for the MEM to get rid of ION and grant the concession to third parties. Claimants also take issue with Respondent's behavior in connection with the Concession both before and after the activation of the termination process. For instance, Claimants refer to the alleged imposition of a hard 180-day deadline for ION to perform the Evaluation Program (which they contend was not established by the law), to the public declarations of the MEM's officials' intention to terminate the Contract (which allegedly prejudiced ION's dealings with potential investors), as well as to Minister Rappaccioli's refusal to grant ION additional time for the exploration of the ION Block in accordance with Law 879. As for the termination process itself, Claimants denounce its undue length (which according to them generated a situation of uncertainty over the future of the Concession), several procedural irregularities on Nicaragua's part, as well as the circumvention of the dispute resolution procedure provided by Article 29 of the Contract and invoked by Claimants.\n\nSee Section X.A.2.a.\n\n502.\n\nClaimants assert that by these actions, Nicaragua breached Article 10.5 of the Treaty because (*i*) it frustrated their legitimate expectations, (*ii*) it failed to act in a transparent and predictable manner, (*iii*) its measures were disproportionate, (*iv*) it acted in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner, and (*v*) failed to respect procedural propriety and due process.\n\n503.\n\nThese contentions are considered separately below.\n\n**i. Legitimate expectations**\n------------------------------\n\n504.\n\nClaimants' argument on the asserted violation of their legitimate expectations rests on the assumption that Claimants were entitled to expect that Nicaragua would comply with the terms of the Contract and would refrain from unlawfully terminating it.682 This argument is based on a confusion between legitimate expectations and contractual obligations. The compliance with the Contract is clearly a contractual obligation and nothing more. As the Tribunal has established above, although the Contract did not contemplate situations in which a purported discovery was reported towards the end of the exploration phase, Nicaragua did indeed comply with the Contract and terminated it lawfully according to its terms. Claimants were perfectly aware that those terms included the contractual obligation for ION to perform the Evaluation Program as a condition for moving to the exploitation phase and Nicaragua's right to terminate if it did not. Moreover, it is undisputed that ION was unable to prove a commercial discovery in spite of the additional time granted to it. ION was even repeatedly and explicitly warned that failure to perform that Program within the original and then the extended deadline would lead to the termination of the Contract. In that context, the Tribunal finds it impossible to hold that Claimants could reasonably expect that Nicaragua would refrain from at some point exercising its contractual right to terminate the Contract.683\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 334-335.\n\nSee Section X.A.2.b b).\n\n505.\n\nThe Tribunal also sees no ground for Claimants' argument that, even if Nicaragua was entitled to terminate the Contract, its failure to reverse the MEM's decision to terminate \"*was inconsistent with the Claimants' legitimate expectation that Nicaragua would exercise its contractual rights in good faith*\".684 The argument is premised on the wrongfulness of the issuance of the Termination Letter. However, as illustrated above,685 Claimants have not shown that the MEM's actions were contrary to the standard procedure for terminating concession contracts and even less to good faith. Despite the administrative inconsistencies of the process discussed above,686 ultimately the Contract was lawfully terminated by Decree 191 and the Termination Decision, since, despite its extension beyond the deadline of the exploration phase set forth therein, ION was unable to prove a commercial discovery, which was a condition for maintaining the Contract, the failure to satisfy which entitled Nicaragua to terminate pursuant to Article 70(b) of Law 286, incorporated in Article 32.1 of the Contract.\n\nReply, \u00b6 337.\n\nSee \u00b6 495 *supra*.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 496 ff. *supra*.\n\n506.\n\nIn light of all the above, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants could not reasonably believe that Respondent would not terminate the Contract in accordance with the contractual provisions.\n\n**ii. Lack of proportionality**\n-------------------------------\n\n507.\n\nClaimants suggest that the termination of the Contract was a disproportionate reaction to ION's failure to perform the Evaluation Program within the prescribed deadline. It thereby allegedly violated the principle of proportionality that, as enounced in *Occidental v. Ecuador*, dictates that any penalty imposed by a State (even if contractually established) must be proportional to the breach to which it responds.687 According to them, the appropriate sanction would instead have been a fine.688\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Award, October 5, 2012, **Exhibit CLA-97**, \u00b6 416; Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 276-277; Reply, \u00b6 368.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 369-370.\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot follow this argument. Claimants in fact ignore the fundamental nature of the obligations set forth in Article 42 of Law 286 relating to the steps to be taken by the concessionaire as a condition for moving to the exploitation phase, and in particular the performance and completion of the Evaluation Program and the submission of a declaration of commercial discovery. Those obligations were instrumental to ensuring that the concessionaire diligently carried out the tasks needed for the development of the potential oil reserves. As recalled, ION also knew that the breach of those fundamental obligations carried with it the risk of termination of the Contract and was conscious of its inability to find oil and lack of technical and financial resources for such purpose.\n\n509.\n\nIn light of these circumstances, Nicaragua's exercise of its fundamental contractual right in the face of ION's well documented inability to meet its obligations and to show its ability to develop the Concession Area can in no way be characterized as a disproportionate remedy.\n\n510.\n\nClaimants' position is further weakened by the fact that, as discussed, before exercising its right to terminate the Contract, Nicaragua granted ION multiple extensions of the deadlines which gave it further opportunities to comply with its obligations, imposing only once a minimal penalty for the delays (the posting in 2011 of the US$ 300,000 bond guaranteeing the correct performance of the minimum exploratory program).689 Nor, contrary to Claimants' position, can the extension of the duration of the exploration phase of concession contracts by Law 879 be taken as evidence that the duration of that phase provided for by Law 286 and by the Contract was unreasonably short. A change in the law is not a demonstration of the disproportionality of the previous regime. In any event, nothing in the record suggests that a lengthier term would have changed the outcome due to ION's inability to assemble the necessary technical and financial resources to comply with the Evaluation Program.\n\nLetter from ION (Mr. Modesto Barrios) to the MEM, November 17, 2011, **Exhibit C-107**.\n\n511.\n\nThis leads the Tribunal to conclude that also the claim of lack of proportionality of Nicaragua's measures must be rejected.\n\n**iii. Arbitrariness and unreasonableness**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nClaimants' argument that Nicaragua acted arbitrarily and unreasonably rests essentially on the allegation that it terminated the Contract without a rational decision-making process and for ulterior motives, and that it failed to deal fairly with Claimants and abused its sovereign powers to unilaterally terminate the Contract.\n\n513.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that these allegations are contradicted by the findings made above that:\n\n(i) Nicaragua was entitled to terminate the Contract in accordance with Article 70(b) of Law 286, incorporated in Article 32.1 of the Contract;690\n\n(ii) Claimants have failed to provide evidence that Nicaragua terminated the Contract as a pretext for granting another party (*i.e.* EastSiberian) a concession over the San Bartolo Block;691\n\n(iii) Nicaragua did not make use of its sovereign powers to terminate the Contract, but rather exercised its contractual rights.692\n\nSee Section X.A.2.b b).\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 473-474 *supra*.\n\nSee Section X.A.2.b a).\n\n514.\n\nIn support of their assertion that Nicaragua failed to deal fairly with them, Claimants rely on *Swisslion v. Macedonia* to argue that the fair and equitable standard might be infringed if the State fails to engage with the investor in a fair manner and ignores its prior commitments.693 Claimants rely on the following passage of that decision:\n\n[a]n issue of contractual compliance arose in which the investor sought to explain the basis for its performance of the terms of the contract with a view to persuading its counterparty that this was not a breach and then sought confirmation of its claimed compliance. In such circumstances, the State had a duty to deal fairly with the investor by engaging with it, in particular to advise it of any concerns it may have had that the investment might not be in compliance with the investor's contractual obligations.694\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 282, 285.\n\n*Swisslion DOO Skopje v. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/16*, Award, July 6, 2012, **Exhibit CLA-93**, \u00b6 287.\n\n515.\n\nThis pronouncement is not pertinent. In *Swisslion*, the investor sought confirmation from the Ministry of the host State that it was complying with its contractual obligations, but the Ministry did not respond. It is against that background that the tribunal found that:\n\n[i]t was unfair for the Ministry not to respond to Swisslion, thereby effectively permitting it to continue to operate the business and make further investments while the Ministry caused other agencies of the government to conduct assessments of the Claimant's contractual compliance. Then, one year later, without prior notice, the Ministry commenced legal proceedings to annul the contract (a proceeding in which the prayer for relief was later amended to a request for termination of the contract).695\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 288.\n\n516.\n\nThe present case is markedly different. Contrary to the Macedonian authorities in *Swisslion*, Nicaragua did engage with ION in relation to its activities in the Concession and the requirements under the Contract. Critically, it confronted ION regarding its failures to perform the Evaluation Program and put it on notice multiple times that the Contract would be terminated if ION did not make a proper declaration of commercial discovery within the established deadlines. Moreover, unlike in the situation in *Swisslion*, ION did not continue to make investments relying on an assumption induced by the State that its conduct was in compliance with the applicable rules.\n\n517.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides that there is no ground for a finding that Nicaragua acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in its treatment of Claimants and their investment.\n\n**iv. Disregard of procedural propriety and due process**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nAs concluded in Section X.A.2.b c) above, there is some merit in Claimants' position that the termination process was not entirely immune from procedural irregularities.\n\n519.\n\nHowever, even if that were so, it would not automatically entail a breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty by Nicaragua.\n\n520.\n\nAccording to case-law, and consistent with the proper interpretation of the MST standard,696 procedural irregularities only amount to breaches of the MST when they are \"*grave enough to shock a sense of judicial propriety*\"697 and, when administrative procedures are involved, the threshold to establish a breach of due process is high.698 In the words of *AES v. Hungary*,\n\nit is not every process failing or imperfection that will amount to a failure to provide fair and equitable treatment. The standard is not one of perfection. It is only when a state's acts or procedural omissions are, on the facts and in the context before the adjudicator, manifestly unfair or unreasonable (such as would shock, or at least surprise a sense of juridical propriety) [\u2026] that the standard can be said to have been infringed.699\n\nSee Section X.A.1.c *supra*.\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States*, **Exhibit RLA-21**, \u00b6 200. See also *Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, INC. and A.S. Baltoil v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award, June 25, 2001, **Exhibit RLA-9**, \u00b6 371.\n\nSee *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Arbitral Award, January 26, 2006, **Exhibit RLA-21**, \u00b6 200 (\"*The administrative due process requirement is lower than that of a judicial process*\").\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v.

The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, June 8, 2009, **Exhibit RLA-40**, \u00b6 771.\n\nRER-Rizo I, \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.\n\n522.\n\nIn any case, if the Nicaraguan authorities' conduct is considered holistically, in the judgment the Tribunal, Claimants have not shown that they violated the high standard required for a breach of MST.\n\n523.\n\nIn fact, although the process of termination of the Contract could have been more straightforward, it was not fraught with shocking or egregious irregularities. ION was put on notice of the consequences of a failure to perform the agreed evaluation activities within the 180-days deadline. Further, the Termination Letter, Decree 191 and the Termination Decision were reasoned and, notwithstanding the inconsistencies mentioned above, were detailed so as to allow Claimants to understand the legal and factual basis for the termination.702 Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the termination was not \u2013 in the words of the *Mondev* tribunal \u2013 \"*clearly improper and discreditable*\".703\n\nLetter from the MEM (Mr. Emilio Rappaccioli) to ION, December 3, 2014, **Exhibit C-34**.\n\n*Mondev International LTD v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, October 11, 2002, **Exhibit CLA-29**, \u00b6 127.\n\n524.\n\nIt also bears reminding that, between 2010 and early 2014, the MEM had exercised its discretion in a manner that benefitted ION (regardless of whether it was also driven by policy considerations), by giving it multiple opportunities to fulfill its contractual obligations even though the deadline for ION to declare a commercial discovery had expired without the Company conducting the Evaluation Program. In particular, the Contract was extended for one year in early 2009, for another year on November 14, 2011 and for additional 180 days on November 19, 2012 and on December 19, 2013, for a total of 39 months.704 In these circumstances, Claimants cannot credibly assert that ION was given no chance \"*to escape its fate*\". In any event, ION's inability to perform the Contract and, particularly, to carry out the Evaluation Program was certainly not impacted by the inaccuracies described above.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 264.\n\n525.\n\nMoreover, even if one were to accept Claimants' grievances and find that the MEM lacked the authority to issue the Termination Letter and that the Letter did not respect fundamental formal requirements, this still would not elevate the termination to a Treaty breach. Indeed, any assumed procedural irregularity affecting the Termination Letter was corrected by Decree 191705 and by the Termination Decision.706\n\nDecree 191, **Exhibit C-45.**\n\nTermination Decision, May 24, 2016, **Exhibit C-55.**\n\n526.\n\nAs for Nicaragua's asserted failure to heed ION's requests to resort to the dispute resolution mechanism of Article 29 of the Contract, the Tribunal finds that Claimants failed to properly pursue that procedure.\n\n527.\n\nION made several references to that dispute settlement mechanism and reserved its rights on several occasions (including January 19, 2015,707 March 6, 2015,708 April 21, 2015,709 June 16, 2015710 and November 12, 2015711), but did not initiate arbitral proceedings.\n\nLetter from ION to the MEM dated January 19, 2015, **Exhibit C-35**.\n\nION's administrative motion dated March 6, 2015, **Exhibit C-37**.\n\nION's administrative appeal dated April 21, 2015, **Exhibit C-41**.\n\nLetter from ION to the MEM dated June 16, 2015, **Exhibit C-43**.\n\nLetter from ION to the Attorney General dated November 12, 2015, **Exhibit C-48**.\n\n528.\n\nIn any case, Article 29 of the Contract only applied to breaches other than those foreseen by Article 70 of Law 286,712 which was precisely the breach that Nicaragua invoked to terminate the Contract. Nicaragua cannot be blamed for not resorting to an inapplicable procedure.\n\nArticle 32(3) of the Contract, **Exhibit C-3**.\n\n529.\n\nAs to Nicaragua's alleged 18-month delay in formally terminating the Contract, the Tribunal accepts that it might have been due to the fact that, as discussed above,713 Law 286 did not set forth the procedure for the unilateral termination of a concession contract by the State, especially in the peculiar circumstances of this case, and ION was the first concession holder to make a declaration of alleged discovery in Nicaragua. In any event, since it is uncontested that ION did not carry out any evaluation during that 18-month period, that delay cannot have had any harmful consequences for ION.\n\nSee \u00b6 493 *supra*.\n\n530.\n\nFinally, not even Claimants' grievances in relation to the lawfulness of Decree 191 are persuasive. For one, Claimants offered no evidence rebutting Dra. Rizo's expert testimony that termination of a Contract by an executive decree was standard practice under Nicaraguan law. Further, the fact that Decree 191 invoked an additional ground for termination (*i.e.* Article 70(e) of Law 286) does not render that Decree incompatible with the termination process initiated with the Termination Letter since, as discussed above, termination was justified pursuant to Article 70(b). In any case, Claimants could have contested the admissibility of the new ground for termination (*i.e*. Article 70 (e)) by challenging Decree 191 before the Nicaraguan courts. ION, however, chose not to do so even though Claimants' counsel acknowledged that the remedy was available to it.714\n\nAccording to Claimants' counsel, ION chose not to pursue an action against the decree as it \"*would have been a much more complex type of proceedings that would have taken several years to be completed*\" (Tr. Day 6, pp. 1308:20-1310:8).\n\n531.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that Nicaragua did not breach procedural propriety and due process in a way capable of qualifying as a breach of the MST.\n\n**v. Lack of transparency and predictability**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n532.\n\nAs discussed above,715 the standard of treatment of Article 10.5 of the Treaty does not incorporate a general duty of transparency, and lack of transparency is only relevant if it reaches the threshold of a serious breach of due process. As discussed above, in the view of the Tribunal, Respondent's actions in terminating the Contract do not meet that threshold.716 Claimants also cannot argue that Nicaragua acted in an unpredictable manner when it chose to terminate the Contract, since ION was indisputably put on notice that failure to adhere to the Evaluation Program would lead to termination.\n\nSee \u00b6 427 *supra*.\n\nSee Section X.A.2.b d) iv. *supra*.\n\n533.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that Nicaragua's alleged lack of transparency did not amount to a breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty.\n\n**vi. The Tribunal's conclusion on the claim for breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n534.\n\nTo recap, despite having been given ample opportunity to prospect for oil in the ION Block, well beyond the initial 6-year exploration term of the Contract, ION never made a commercial discovery and did not even conduct an evaluation of its purported \"*descubrimiento*\" in order to establish its commercial potential. The terms of Law 286 and of the Contract were clear in this respect and well understood by ION: a declaration of commercial discovery, preceded by the performance of an evaluation program, was an inescapable condition for the passage from the exploration phase to the exploitation phase, and failure to satisfy that condition was an explicit ground for termination of the Contract, pursuant to Article 70(b) of Law 286, incorporated into the Contract by virtue of Article 32.1.\n\n535.\n\nAlthough, according to the Contract, Nicaragua was entitled to terminate it as of November 2012, when ION reached the end of the exploration phase without making a declaration of commercial discovery, Nicaragua granted it a 180-day period to conduct the evaluation which, if successful, would have allowed it to enter the exploitation phase. Not even with the benefit of that extension did ION succeed in performing such an evaluation. Actually, during that period, ION did not carry out any meaningful activity, but rather merely continued its unsuccessful search for a potential partner which would be able to deal with the financial and the technical aspects of the project. Claimants could not reasonably hold an expectation to maintain the Contract in force indefinitely, in the hope that at some point they would have been able to assemble the necessary technical and financial resources to carry out the Evaluation Program or find a suitable investor for such purpose.\n\n536.\n\nBecause of all this, the Tribunal cannot accept Claimants' allegations that it was the MEM's declarations to the press, threats of termination and the Termination Letter that dissuaded potential investors from entering the project. The record indicates that the lack of interest of investors in the ION Bock was due to a number of other factors. These included the fact that Nicaragua had no known reserves of hydrocarbons717 and that the disappointing results of the tests carried out by ION lead to presume the absence of recoverable, let alone commercial, reserves in the ION Block,718 as well as the drop of crude oil prices commencing in mid-2014 after the cycle of high prices from 2011 to 2014.719 Ryder Scott's720 and Quadrant's721 examinations were persuasive on these points.\n\nTr. Day 5, p. 1147: 1-7.\n\nSproule Report, **Exhibit C-15**, pp. 1-4, 20; RER-Ryder Scott I, \u00b6\u00b6 13-17, 49-54, \u00b6 120; RER-Ryder Scott II, \u00b6\u00b6 20-32, 40, 46, 80, \u00b6\u00b6 111-113; Tr.

Claimants cannot complain that, because they were given an opportunity to remedy their default and were granted a grace period not explicitly provided for by Law 286 to carry out the Evaluation Program, that would have entitled them to continue indefinitely their operations (which were actually almost non-existent).\n\n538.\n\nThe Tribunal has not found that Nicaragua committed any serious impropriety or violation of due process throughout its relationship with ION that rises to the level of a breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty, including in the way it handled the termination of the Contract and the time it took for that process to come to fruition. If any such impropriety was committed, it was minor and could be explained by the uncertainties of the applicable legal framework and the absence of precedents of termination of similar concession contracts. In any case, as noted above, any procedural errors affecting the initial phase of the termination procedure (in particular, those regarding the Termination Letter and its controversial status as an administrative act) were eventually cured by the issuance of Decree 191 and the subsequent Termination Decision. There is likewise no evidence that ION suffered any prejudice from Nicaragua's actions in the final phases of the relationship. ION incurred no significant costs or other loss or damage as a result of Nicaragua's assumed improprieties.\n\n539.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal is satisfied that Nicaragua's conduct has not fallen foul of the standard of treatment prescribed by Article 10.5 of the Treaty and that Claimants' complaints in this respect must be denied.\n\n**X.B The alleged breach of Article 10.7 of the Treaty (expropriation)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***X.B.1 The Parties' positions***\n----------------------------------\n\n***X.B.1.a Claimants' position***\n---------------------------------\n\n540.\n\nClaimants base their claim of expropriation of their investment on Article 10.7 of the Treaty, which protects investors from direct and indirect722 expropriation except under certain conditions listed in Article 10.7.1.723\n\nAnnex 10-C of the Treaty defines indirect expropriations as a situation \"*where an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure*\" and adds that \"*whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation, requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry*\" considering factors identified in the Annex.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 233-234; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 374-375.\n\n541.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the analysis of whether an expropriation occurred must begin by \"*identifying the assets or investments that have been allegedly expropriated*\".724 On this point, they argue that \"*contractual rights are susceptible of expropriation under international law*\".725 They argue that whether State conduct amounts to an expropriation does not depend on whether the State exercises contractual rights.726 Instead, faced with an allegation of expropriation, tribunals assess the compliance of the State with the treaty standard in light of *all* circumstances.727 Moreover, a \"*State cannot avoid liability by self-certifying its conduct as commercial, not sovereign*\"728 and \u2013 in any case \u2013 \"*Nicaragua was acting as sovereign at all times*\" as a consequence of the legal framework governing the Concession.729\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 237.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 239.\n\nReply, \u00b6 379, and case-law quoted in fn. 905 and 906.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 379-382.\n\nReply, \u00b6 384.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 384-386.\n\n542.\n\nClaimants also object to Respondent's assertion that an incorrectly executed termination based on a State's contractual rights would, at most, lead to a contract breach.730 In fact, failure to rectify an incorrect termination leads to an unlawful expropriation if it \"*results in the cessation of the investment activity*\", and \"*that the same conduct breached the Concession Contract, as well as the Treaty, does not undermine the Claimants' claims under the Treaty*\".731\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 267.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 388-389.\n\n543.\n\nClaimants contend that the termination of the Contract resulted in the direct expropriation of Claimants' indirect contractual rights, and the indirect expropriation of their shares in ION, which have been rendered worthless.732\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 390, 394-398. In the Memorial, Claimants qualified these grounds as alternative (see Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 240-241).\n\n544.\n\nThe termination was \"*clearly wrongful*\", as the MEM purported to terminate the Contract without the authority to do so and relying on a ground that was no longer available to Nicaragua.733 Claimants deny that this is \"*simply a case of Nicaragua making a series of errors in its termination of the Concession Contract*\", as \"*Nicaragua's true purpose was to get rid of ION and transfer its rights in the Concession to a favoured third party*\" through a conduct that \"*would not withstand scrutiny*\".734\n\nReply, \u00b6 392.\n\nReply, \u00b6 393.\n\n545.\n\nMoreover, the expropriation was unlawful, as it failed to comply with the conditions in Article 10.7.735\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 244-245; Reply, \u00b6 399. Under Article 10.7, an expropriation is lawful if it is performed \"*(a) for a public purpose; (b) in a non-discriminatory manner; (c) on payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation [\u2026]; (d) in accordance with due process of law and Article 10.5*\".\n\n***X.B.1.b Respondent's position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' construction of the standard of Article 10.7.\n\n547.\n\nIn particular, Respondent highlights that case-law is consistent in showing that termination of a contract by a State can be considered expropriation only when the State acts \"*outside the legal framework of the contract on the basis of superior sovereign authority*\". By contrast, when a State incorrectly terminates a contract in the exercise of its contractual rights, it \"*would, at most, incur a contract breach to be addressed pursuant to the dispute resolution mechanism established in the contract; it would not be a treaty violation*\".736 On this point, Claimants ignore the \"*black letter law*\" and the consistent jurisprudence cited in the Counter-Memorial, incorrectly focusing \"*on inapposite cases that address an irrelevant matter pertaining to jurisdiction over contract claims, not whether an expropriation has occurred*\".737\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 267; Rejoinder, \u00b6 256.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 257.\n\n548.\n\nIn order to determine whether the termination of the Contract is an expropriation under international law, the Tribunal should \"*(1) identify the relevant rights and obligations of the* Parties *under the legal framework of the Contract; and (2) determine whether Nicaragua terminated the Contract on the basis of its rights within that legal framework or on the basis of superior sovereign authority*\".738\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 275.\n\n549.\n\nRespondent contends that the termination of the Contract was a legitimate measure adopted pursuant to Article 70(b) of Law 286 (incorporated into the Contract by virtue of Article 32.1), which provided for a termination \"*sin requisito previo*\" failing a commercial discovery at the end of the exploration phase.739\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 276-278; Rejoinder, \u00b6 258. According to Respondent, \"*Nicaragua's decisions to grant ION two additional time periods at the end of the exploration phase to further attempt to make a commercial discovery did not waive or extinguish its right to terminate the Contract under Article 70(b) of the Law and Article 32.1 of the Contract, which it was free to exercise at the end of these additional periods if no commercial discovery had been declared*\" (Rejoinder, \u00b6 259).\n\n550.\n\nThus, as evidenced by the Termination Letter, in terminating the Contract Nicaragua exercised its contractual rights, rather than its sovereign authority.740\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 280-281; Rejoinder, \u00b6 268, referring to Letter from the MEM (Mr. Emilio Rappaccioli) to ION, December 3, 2014, **Exhibit C-34**.\n\n551.\n\nFurther, the termination was \"*by definition proportionate: It is the only consequence explicitly contemplated by the law for ION's failure to make a commercial discovery*\".741 Moreover, it was not a mere pretext for Nicaragua to achieve its political goals, as Claimants imply. In fact, on the one hand, Nicaragua \"*attempted to help ION [\u2026] make a commercial discovery \u2013 by extending the time it had to make such a discovery [\u2026] of some 39 months*\".742 On the other hand, the evidence refutes Claimants' accusation that Nicaragua was negotiating over the ION Block with EastSiberian before the MEM terminated the Contract. As a matter of fact, \"*Nicaragua has never granted rights over this block to any third party*\".743\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 263.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 264.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 265.\n\n552.\n\nIn light of this, Respondent argues that Claimants' assertion that Nicaragua expropriated its contractual rights or other property has no legal basis or evidentiary support.744\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 270.\n\n***X.B.2 The Tribunal's analysis and decision***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe subject of Claimants' expropriation claim is the same conduct of Nicaragua that is the subject of the claim for breach of the MST, in other words the termination of the Contract. According to Claimants, in addition to constituting a breach of Article 10.5 of the Treaty, the termination of the Contract was a taking of property in violation of Article 10.7 because it resulted in the direct expropriation of the contractual rights indirectly held by them, and in the indirect expropriation of their shares in ION.745\n\nSee \u00b6 543 *supra*.\n\n554.\n\nArticle 10.7 of the Treaty prescribes that\n\n1. No Party may expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (\"expropriation\"), except:\n\n(a) for a public purpose;\n\n(b) in a non-discriminatory manner;\n\n(c) on payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2 through 4; and\n\n(d) in accordance with due process of law and Article 10.5 [of the Treaty].\n\n555.\n\nRespondent's principal defense to this claim is that its termination of the Contract cannot be characterized as an expropriation because it was \"*a 'valid,' 'legitimate,' and 'justifiable' exercise of its contractual right*\".746\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 279.\n\n556.\n\nIt is undisputed that, as Claimants submit, contractual rights are susceptible to expropriation. The question here is whether the termination of a contract by the State can in and of itself amount to an expropriation.\n\n557.\n\nThe unanimous position in the case-law and doctrine747 is that the termination of a contract by a State acting as private contracting party, in conformity with the private rules governing it, does not constitute an expropriation. It can only rise to the level of an expropriation if it involves an act of sovereign authority.\n\nA. Reinisch, *Expropriation*, in P. Muchlinski et al.

Schreuer, *Principles Of International Investment Law*, 3rd ed., 2022, p. 151-153).\n\n558.\n\nThis position, which Respondent terms black letter law, is set forth in clear terms in countless awards. For example, in *Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela*, the tribunal held that:\n\n[i]t is well established that, in order to amount to an expropriation under international law, it is necessary that the conduct of the State should go beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt.748\n\n*Vannessa Ventures v.

The case is thus distinguishable from the one at stake, for the reasons set out in Section a).\n\n562.\n\nUltimately, in all those awards, the decision on whether an expropriation had occurred was made on the basis of whether the State did or did not act in the exercise of its private law rights. In all the cases cited by Claimants in which the State's termination of the contract was found to constitute an expropriation, the tribunals determined that the State had acted in its sovereign capacity.\n\n563.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Tribunal has already found that Nicaragua terminated the Contract acting not in its capacity as a sovereign, but rather as a private commercial contracting party, and according to the Tribunal, in accordance with the grounds for termination foreseen by the Contract and its applicable law.758 The Tribunal has also established that the termination was not driven by ulterior motives or in any way abusive.759 Moreover, the Tribunal has also established that ION had no right to the continuity of the Contract for an indefinite period.\n\nSee Section X.A.2.b a) and b) *supra*.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 473-474, Section X.A.2.b d) *supra*.\n\n564.\n\nThis is sufficient for the Tribunal to exclude that Nicaragua's termination of the Contract can qualify as an expropriation in violation of Article 10.7 of the Treaty. Accordingly, also Claimants' claim for expropriation is rejected.\n\n**XI. Q****uantum**\n-------------------\n\n**XI.A The Parties' position**\n------------------------------\n\n***XI.A.1 Claimants' position***\n--------------------------------\n\n565.\n\nClaimants argue that, due to Nicaragua's conduct, they have lost their contractual rights to exploit the Concession held through ION and the economic value of their shares. The corresponding damages should be quantified according to the FMV760 of the Concession761 at the Date of Valuation. Claimants claim 58,02% of such amount, corresponding to the shares in ION they collectively own.\n\nDefined as \"*the price that a willing buyer would reasonably be expected to pay to a willing seller in an arms-length and informed transaction if the measures would not have occurred*\" (Memorial, \u00b6 309; Reply, \u00b6 431).\n\nClaimants note that the \"*San Bartolo Block has enormous untapped potential and, as a result, had significant market value by the time Nicaragua terminated the Concession Contract*\" (Reply, \u00b6 440).\n\n566.\n\nOn this basis, Claimants submit four alternative valuations: (*i*) the Discounted Cash Flow Valuation, resulting in damages of US$ 35.8 million as of the Date of Valuation, (*ii*) the Loss of Opportunity Valuation based on Sunk Costs, resulting in damages of US$ 44.1 million as of the Date of Valuation, (*iii*) the Loss of Opportunity Valuation based on Norwood's Net Present Value projections, resulting in damages of US$ 139.2 million in the low case and of US$ 198 million in the base case as of the Date of Valuation, and finally (*iv*) the Loss of Opportunity Valuation based on Norwood's expenditures, resulting in damages of US$ 61.6 million as of the Date of Valuation.762\n\nReply, \u00b6 497.\n\n***XI.A.2 Respondent's position***\n----------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants' claim for damages is unfounded and speculative. Indeed, Claimants have not proven the damages they allege to have suffered, since they failed to prove that they purchased their shares or financially contributed to the alleged investment.763 They have likewise not proven a causal link between the alleged breaches and the alleged damages, in other words \"*that but-for the State's unlawful act, the harm would not have occurred and that the injury was proximately caused by the State's actions*\".764 According to Respondent, even if the Contract had not been terminated, the Concession would still not have been operational, as the Concession Area was not shown to be commercially exploitable, and Claimants lacked the financial and technical capability to exploit it and would have failed to comply with the legal requirements to exploit the Concession.765\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 312-318. Further, any damage suffered by ION \"*cannot be presumed to flow automatically through to its shareholders*\".\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 330 and case-law quoted therein. See also Rejoinder, \u00b6 324.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 319-323.\n\n568.\n\nFinally, Respondent asserts that Claimants have not proven the amount of damages they claim, since the FMV standard they rely on is not useful in relation to non-expropriatory breaches766 and their multiple and wide-ranging valuations are speculative.767\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 340-344.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 345-349. In particular, the DCF Valuation is as grounded on speculative and unreliable data, and based on a method which is inappropriate both from an industry and a legal perspective (Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 350-355). As for the Sunk Costs Valuation, \"*Claimants do not justify why they, as alleged shareholders of ION, should be entitled to recover Norwood's sunk costs*\" and the fact that the Concession's sunk costs are higher than its DCF Valuation \"*defies common sense*\" (Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 356-363). Finally, the Loss of Opportunity Valuations lack foundation and are \"*extremely flawed*\" (Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 364-375).\n\n**XI.B The Tribunal's analysis and decision**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n569.\n\nThe Tribunal having unanimously established that there has been no breach of Article 10.5 or 10.7 of the Treaty, Claimants' request for damages has no basis and is dismissed. Even had it found that Respondent did commit some form of breach, the Tribunal still would not have been able to award damages because Claimants have not established the nature of such damages, nor the causal link between any supposed loss and Nicaragua's conduct. In any case, as explained above, there are no damages to be awarded both because of the absence of a commercial discovery and because the repeated tests conducted in the ION Block demonstrated the lack of a flow of hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to be commercial and the low prospects of upgrading the contingent and prospective resources into recoverable reserves.\n\n570.\n\nThis conclusion renders moot Claimants' claim for interest on the amounts claimed.\n\n**XII. R****espondent****'****s** **C****ounterclaim**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n571.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Nicaragua's Counterclaim submitted pursuant to Article 10 of the CAFTA-DR and Articles 25 and 46 of the ICSID Convention. As mentioned above, by the Counterclaim, Nicaragua seeks compensation for damages caused by alleged breaches of ION's environmental obligations that it contends would be attributable to Claimants. For their part, Claimants question the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the Counterclaim and argue that any breach of ION's environmental obligations would not be attributable to them and, in any event, would be minimal and related to Nicaragua's arbitrary termination of the Contract.\n\n572.\n\nThe Tribunal will begin by addressing jurisdiction.\n\n**XII.A Jurisdiction over the Counterclaim**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n***XII.A.1 The Parties' positions***\n------------------------------------\n\n***XII.A.1.a Claimants' position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n573.\n\nClaimants posit that the Counterclaim should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, as it falls outside the scope of the Parties' consent to arbitration.\n\n574.\n\nFirst, they observe that if the parties to the CAFTA-DR had wished to permit counterclaims, they would have included an express provision to that effect in the Treaty.768 The lack of such a provision is \"*unsurprising*\" in light of the formulation of Article 10.16 of the Treaty, which only allows investors to submit disputes to arbitration as claimants769 and which has been interpreted by case-law and commentators alike as excluding the ability of the respondent to bring a counterclaim.770 Claimants submit that this is consistent with the framework of Article 10 of the Treaty, which limits the scope of that provision to \"*measures adopted or maintained by*\" a State (Article 10.1), stipulates that claims can be submitted for breaches of \"*an obligation under Section A [of the Treaty]*\", which refers to obligations of the State (Article 10.16), refers to \"Awards\" as a \"*final award against a respondent*\" (Article 10.26.1)771 and defines a \"*claimant*\" as an \"*investor of a Party*\" and a \"*respondent*\" as \"*the Party [i.e. a contracting State] that is a party to an investment dispute*\".772\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 101.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 98.\n\nReply, \u00b6 520 and fn. 1161, \u00b6 521; Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 99 and fn. 245, 246.\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 100.\n\nReply, \u00b6 519(e).\n\n575.\n\nClaimants dispute Respondent's reading of Article 10.20.7 of the Treaty that would allow counterclaims not captured by the exceptions mentioned therein. In Claimants' submission jurisdiction over counterclaims under investment treaties cannot be inferred. In this respect, they also observe that the references to *Urbaser v. Argentina*773 and *Goetz v. Burundi*774 are misplaced.\n\n*Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Biskaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v.

Republic of Burundi*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/2, Award, June 21, 2012, **Exhibit RLA-61**.\n\n576.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants say that the authorities relied on by Nicaragua confirm that the NAFTA (on which Article 10.16 is modeled) excludes the possibility of counterclaims, even though it contains a provision virtually identical to Article 10.20.7 of the Treaty.775\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 105.\n\n577.\n\nClaimants also suggest that Respondent's appeals to efficiency are inapposite.776\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 109.\n\n578.\n\nLastly, Claimants assert that the findings in the *Aven v. Costa Rica* case are fatal to the Counterclaim.777 In particular, according to Claimants, Nicaragua's quotation of the decision is misleading.778 Indeed, while Claimants concede that the *Aven* tribunal \"*erroneously*\" found that counterclaims \"*could theoretically be brought under the Treaty*\",779 Claimants note that the tribunal also required that counterclaims be based on breaches of the Treaty and rejected that a breach of domestic environmental obligations \"*will amount to a breach of the Treaty which could be the basis of a counterclaim*\".780 In this case, while Respondent accepts that a breach of Section A of the Treaty must be established to submit a dispute to arbitration under the Treaty, the Counterclaim is grounded on purported breaches of contracts and of Nicaraguan laws.781 This means that \"*Nicaragua's counterclaims are defeated by its own admissions*\", since no jurisdiction exists under the Treaty if there is no asserted breach of any positive obligations under Section A of the Treaty.782\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 110, referring to *David Aven et al v.

Costa Rica*, which concluded that \"*there are no substantive reasons to exempt foreign investor of the scope of claims* [sic] *for breaching obligations under Article 10 Section A DR-CAFTA, particularly in the field of environmental law*\".787 In this context, Respondent submits that Articles 10.9.3.c and 10.11 of the Treaty render mandatory the measures adopted by Nicaragua for the protection of the environment.788\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 390.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 392, quoting *Aven v. Costa Rica*, **Exhibit RLA-103**, \u00b6 739.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 392.\n\n581.\n\nRespondent also considers irrelevant the *Aven* tribunal's finding that Articles 10.9.3.c and 10.11 of the Treaty do not impose affirmative obligations on investors or provide that any violation of national environmental regulations will amount to a Treaty breach.789 Indeed, Respondent notes that this does not contradict its position, as Nicaragua is not \"*seeking to impose affirmative obligations arising from the Treaty*\" or \"*asserting that every violation of a State's environmental regulations amounts to a breach of the Treaty*\".790 Instead, Respondent highlights that it \"*has set forth specific, critical violations of environmental closure and remediation requirements explicitly included in the Concession Contract, Environmental Permit, and ION's Environmental Impact Assessment, as well as Nicaraguan laws*\".791 Therefore, Respondent submits that the present case falls within the reasoning of the *Aven* tribunal that *prima facie* jurisdiction over a counterclaim is established under the CAFTA-DR.792\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 522-523, referring to *Aven v.

By contrast, in Respondent's view, Article 10.20.7 is aimed at defining the limits of a respondent's ability to hold investors responsible for breaches of obligations, including environmental obligations.794\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 395.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 396.\n\n583.\n\nLastly, Respondent notes that support for the aforementioned position is found in case-law \u2013 notably in the decisions in *Urbaser v.

Whether jurisdiction over such claims exists in a given case therefore depends, like for principal claims, on the applicable legal instruments, which in the case at hand are the ICSID Convention and the Treaty. The need to establish consent under the relevant treaty is acknowledged also by Respondent,797 which initially suggested that Article 46 of the ICSID Convention was sufficient to establish jurisdiction over a counterclaim.798\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 390.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 435.\n\n585.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention empowers ICSID tribunals to decide \"*counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Center*\". In the present case, it is common ground between the Parties that the Counterclaim is sufficiently connected to the principal claim, so that the first condition of Article 46 of the ICSID Convention is satisfied.799\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 442-443 where Respondent cites *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction over the Czech Republic's Counterclaim, May 7, 2004, **Exhibit RLA-17**, \u00b6 81. Claimants do not dispute the Counterclaim's connection to the Claim since their position is that ION's alleged failure to comply with environmental obligations is \"*connected to Nicaragua's unlawful termination of the Concession Contract*\" (Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 96).\n\n586.\n\nThe Parties' disagreement focuses on whether counterclaims are admissible under the Treaty.\n\n587.\n\nRespondent's position is that the Parties' consent to jurisdiction over counterclaims is given in Articles 10.15, 10.16 of the Treaty and is confirmed by an *a contrario* reading of Article 10.27. Claimants, instead, contend that the Treaty does not allow counterclaims, because none of the provisions cited by Respondent provide for them while others, such as Article 10.1, 10.26.1 and 10.28, are incompatible with counterclaims.800\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 519.\n\n588.\n\nFor ease of reference, the Treaty provisions referred to by the Parties, in discussing the basis for the Counterclaim, are reproduced below:\n\n589.\n\nArticle 10.1 reads as follows:\n\nThis Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) investors of another Party;\n\n(b) covered investments; and [\u2026]\n\n590.\n\nArticle 10.15 provides that:\n\nIn the event of an investment dispute, the claimant and the respondent should initially seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third-party procedures such as conciliation and mediation.\n\n591.\n\nThe main provision on which Respondent relies is Article 10.16 which reads as follows:\n\n1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:\n\n(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B)an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement;\n\nand\n\n(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and [\u2026]801\n\nArticle 10.16.1(b) reproduces the wording of Article 10.16.1(a) with the sole exception of the identification of the entity on behalf of which the claim may be brought: \"*on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly*\".\n\n592.\n\nArticle 10.20.7 reads as follows802:\n\nA respondent may not assert as a defense, counterclaim, right of set-off, or for any other reason that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract.\n\n\"*A respondent may not assert as a defense, counterclaim, right of set-off, or for any other reason that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract*\".\n\n593.\n\nArticle 10.26.1 reads as follows:\n\nWhere a tribunal makes a final award against a respondent, the tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:\n\n(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest;\n\n(b) restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent may pay monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.\n\nA tribunal may also award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules [\u2026]\n\n594.\n\nFinally, Article 10.28 provides that:\n\n[\u2026] **claimant** means an investor of a Party that is a party to an investment dispute with another Party [\u2026]803\n\nEmphasis in the original.\n\n595.\n\nContrary to Claimants' assertion, Article 10 of the Treaty could be read as permitting counterclaims. In particular, the wording of Articles 10.16 and 10.17, respectively headed \"Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\" and \"Consent of Each Party to Arbitration\", is in principle broad enough to encompass counterclaims.804 Indeed, in line with the trend that conceives investment treaty arbitration as a potentially bidirectional avenue, Article 10.16 employs the neutral terms \"claimant\" and \"respondent\" (rather than \"investor\" or \"State\", as customary in earlier treaties) to identify the individuals or entities entitled to submit claims to arbitration. In this respect, the situation is analogous to the one considered in *Urbaser v. Argentina* where the tribunal found, based on treaty provisions similar to the ones at hand, that \"[t]*his provision is completely neutral as to the identity of the claimant and respondent in an investment dispute '*between the parties*'. It does not indicate that a State Party could not sue an investor in relation to a dispute concerning an investment*\".805\n\nA.

Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction over the Czech Republic's Counterclaim, May 7, 2004**, Exhibit RLA-17**, Preliminary Objections.\n\n*Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Biskaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Award, December 8, 2016, **Exhibit RLA-94**, \u00b6 1143.\n\n596.\n\nThe above conclusion is supported by the text of Article 10.20.7 of the Treaty. The reference to counterclaims that may be brought by a respondent \u2013 albeit to exclude a specific type of counterclaim (those in which the respondent alleges that \"*the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all or part of the alleged damages pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract*\") \u2013 could indeed be interpreted as allowing all other types of counterclaims.806 The Tribunal is not persuaded that consent to counterclaims cannot be inferred from Article 10.20.7 on the grounds that, as contended by Claimants,807 this provision is modelled on Article 1137.3 of the NAFTA, a treaty that bars counterclaims. This is because the Treaty differs considerably from the NAFTA. Indeed, contrary to Article 10.16.1 of the Treaty, which as mentioned above, employs the neutral term \"claimant\" to identify the individual or entity bringing a claim, Articles 1116 and 1117 of the NAFTA \u2013 respectively headed \"*Claims by an Investor of a Party on its behalf*\" and \"*Claims by an Investor on behalf of an enterprise*\" \u2013 are strictly \"unidirectional\", in the sense that they only contemplate claims brought by an \"investor\". This major discrepancy prevents the Tribunal from accepting that the NAFTA provides guidance on whether the Treaty reflects the consent to counterclaims.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share Respondent's position that its reading of Article 10.20.7 is supported by *Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Biskaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Award, December 8, 2016, **Exhibit RLA-94**, \u00b6 1155, and *Antoine Goetz & Consorts and S.A. Affinage des Metaux v. Republic of Burundi*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/2, Award, June 21, 2012, **Exhibit RLA-61**, \u00b6\u00b6 278-279. *Urbaser* was based on a treaty providing \u2013 unlike the CAFTA-DR \u2013 that *either party* may submit a claim to arbitration (Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 106). *Goetz*, instead, like Professor Reisman's dissent in *Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/1, Declaration of W. Michael Reisman, November 28, 2011, **Exhibit RLA-55**) on which *Goetz* relies is based on the legal theory \u2013 rejected by the majority in *Roussalis* (*Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/1, Award, December 7, 2011, **Exhibit RLA-56**., \u00b6 869) and now abandoned by Nicaragua \u2013 that the ICSID Convention grants an ICSID tribunal jurisdiction over counterclaims regardless of whether the relevant treaty contains consent to the submission of counterclaims (Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 107).\n\nClaimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 105.\n\n597.\n\nBased on the above provisions taken by themselves, Nicaragua would therefore be entitled to bring a counterclaim.\n\n598.\n\nThe other provisions of Article 10 of the Treaty cursorily mentioned by Claimants do not detract from this conclusion. In fact, since, as noted above, Article 10.16 is neutral as to the identity of the claimant and respondent, the fact that Article 10.26.1 mentions a \"*final award against a* ***respondent***\"808 cannot be read as ruling out counterclaims brought by the State against an investor. Likewise, the definition of claimant as \"*an investor*\" provided in Article 10.28 implies that States may not initiate arbitration proceedings under the Treaty but does not bar States from putting forward a counterclaim at a later stage. Lastly, contrary to Claimants' suggestion, the text of Article 10.1 of the Treaty (\"*This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to: (a) investors of another Party; (b) covered investments; [\u2026]*) is in principle broad enough to encompass obligations imposed on the investor by the State, the breach of which could form the basis for a counterclaim.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n599.\n\nThe foregoing considerations are however not sufficient to conclude that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Counterclaim. This is because Article 10.16.1(a) lays down a further requirement, namely that the (counter)claim relate to a breach of either \"*an obligation under Section A [of the Treaty]*\", an investment authorization or an investment agreement. This means that, for a claim (or a counterclaim) to fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the claimant or counterclaimant must establish a cause of action under the Treaty. As a matter of fact, both Parties accept that for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over the Counterclaim, this would have to be predicated on a breach of Section A of the Treaty. **809**\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 392, citing to *Aven v. Costa Rica*, **Exhibit RLA-103**, \u00b6 739; Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6 103.\n\n600.\n\nThe core issue is thus whether ION's alleged breaches of its environmental obligations do indeed constitute breaches of Section A of the Treaty, as Respondent asserts. This requires ascertaining whether Articles 10.9.3(c)810 and 10.11811 of the Treaty, on which Respondent relies, set out environmental obligations.\n\n\"*Provided that such measures are not applied in an arbitrary or unjustifiable manner, and provided that such measures do not constitute a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, paragraphs 1(b), (c), and (f), and 2(a) and (b), shall not be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures, including environmental measures: (i) necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with this Agreement; (ii) necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health; or (iii) related to the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources*\".\n\n\"*Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns*\".\n\n601.\n\nIn the Tribunal's judgment, on a plain reading, those provisions do not themselves directly lay down environmental obligations for investors. They are mere \"safeguard clauses\", the purpose of which is to allow States to pursue and enforce their environmental policies without the risk of their actions in furtherance of those policies being held to breach their obligations towards investors under the Treaty. As underscored by Claimants,812 the *Aven* tribunal reached a similar conclusion noting that Articles 10.9.3(c) and 10.11 of the Treaty \"*do not \u2013 in and of themselves \u2013 impose any affirmative obligation upon investors. Nor do they provide that any violation of state-enacted environmental regulations will amount to a breach of the Treaty which could be the basis of a counterclaim*\".**813**\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 522-523; Claimants' Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 111-112.\n\n*Aven v. Costa Rica*, **Exhibit RLA-103**, \u00b6 743.\n\n602.\n\nHaving established this, the next question is whether Articles 10.9.3(c) and 10.11 of the Treaty relating to State-mandated environmental measures could be read as incorporating into the Treaty environmental obligations arising under domestic law or in a contractual instrument binding on the investor. If that were so, it could be possible to establish a cause of action under the Treaty by alleging breaches of the type that underpin the Counterclaim, which, to recall, are alleged breaches of provisions of Nicaraguan law and of the Contract, the Environmental Permit and ION's Environmental Permit.**814**\n\nRespondent accepts that the Counterclaim is based on a breach on ION's part of environmental obligations grounded in the Contract, the Environmental Permit, ION's Environmental Impact Assessment and Nicaraguan laws (see Rejoinder, \u00b6 394).\n\n603.\n\nHowever, this is not the case. The references in Chapter 10 of the Treaty to State-mandated environmental measures (such as the ones listed in Articles 10.9.3(c) and 10.11) are generic, are addressed to the State (the Parties to the CAFTA-DR) rather than to the investor and concern a typical State prerogative (Article 10.11 mentions \"*adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure*\"). For these reasons, they cannot be read as entailing that breaches of obligations not directly arising from the Treaty \u2013 such as those of the Contract, the Environmental Permit, ION's Environmental Impact Assessment and Nicaraguan environment protection laws alleged by Respondent \u2013 can be elevated to violations of the Treaty.\n\n604.\n\nThe following conclusion of the *Rusoro v. Venezuela* tribunal rejecting a counterclaim by the State, recalled by Claimants, aptly encapsulates the situation here:\n\n[t]here are three reasons why the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate this dispute:\n\n- First, the Tribunal's power is limited to adjudicating disputes which arise from the BIT, and the obligations allegedly breached by Rusoro do not derive from and have no connection with the Treaty;\n\n- Second, the Tribunal must decide the dispute in accordance with the Treaty and the principles of international law, and the dispute underlying the counterclaim \u2013 that Rusoro breached the mine plan \u2013 and [sic] cannot be adjudicated by applying the Treaty or principles of international law;\n\n- Third, the Treaty does not afford host States a cause of action against an investor of the other Contracting Party, be it by way of claim or of counterclaim.815\n\n*Rusoro Mining Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/5, Award, August 22, 2016, **Exhibit CLA-112**, \u00b6 628. See also *Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/1, Award, December 7, 2011, **Exhibit RLA-56**, \u00b6 871.\n\n605.\n\nHaving concluded that the Treaty does not confer jurisdiction in respect of the Counterclaim, the Tribunal must reject Nicaragua's argument that deciding counterclaims in the same proceedings as claims would foster efficiency and avoid conflicting results. As was decided in *Iberdrola v. Guatemala*, the Tribunal's role \"*is limited to applying the treaty on the basis of which it is seized in accordance with its terms. It cannot go beyond or else it would engage in policy choices which are the domain of States*\".816\n\n*Iberdrola Energ\u00eda, S.A. v. Republic of Guatemala*, PCA Case No. 2017-41, Final Award, August 24, 2020, **Exhibit CLA-159**, \u00b6 392.\n\n606.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal judges that, since Respondent is not asserting a breach by Claimants of environmental obligations incorporated in the Treaty, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the Counterclaim, which is accordingly denied.\n\n**XIII. C****osts**\n-------------------\n\n**XIII.A Claimants' cost submissions**\n--------------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nIn their submission on costs, Claimants contend that Respondent should bear their entire arbitration costs totaling US$ 524,970 and \u20ac 2,912,957.30, plus interest at the rate requested for their primary monetary claims (12.1%) \"*or at any other rate that ensures full reparation, compounded annually until full payment has been made*\".817 The arbitration costs are broken down as follows:\n\n(i) advance payments of fees and expenses of the Tribunal and administrative costs of ICSID for US$ 524,970;818\n\n(ii) fees and expenses of international counsel for \u20ac 2,173,759.75;819\n\n(iii) fees and expenses of local counsel for \u20ac 35,884.36;820\n\n(iv) fees and expenses of experts for \u20ac 407,456.85 to Compass Lexecon and Michael Seelhof, \u20ac 176,965.55 to Reserve Analysts Associates, and \u20ac 96,467.68 to ERM;821\n\n(v) travel costs and compensation for the time of witnesses for \u20ac 22,423.11.822\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 17(ii).\n\nOf this amount, US$ 499,970 relate to an advance of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID, and US$ 25,000 relate to the non-refundable lodging fee paid by Claimants (Claimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 12).\n\nOf this amount, \u20ac 2,028,500.00 relate to professional fees of the firm Dechamps International Law and Dr. Tariq Baloch, while \u20ac 145,259.75 relate to expenses reasonably incurred by them, including fees of external consultants (Claimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 13).\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 14.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 15.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 16.\n\n608.\n\nClaimants argue that they are entitled to recover these costs because Nicaragua's conduct in the proceedings was dilatory and caused unnecessary expense to them.823 Claimants identify instances of such conduct in Respondent's (*i*) raising frivolous jurisdictional and merits defenses,824 (*ii*) withdrawing its request to examine a witness (Dr. Raymond Gerald Bailey) only two weeks before the Hearing, once substantial time and expense had been incurred in his preparation,825 and (*iii*) bringing a counterclaim falling manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which led to Claimants engaging ERM to respond to it.826\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 6.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 7.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 8.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 9.\n\n**XIII.B Respondent's cost submissions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n609.\n\nIn its submission on costs, Respondent submits that Claimants should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings, totaling US$ 8,010,198.32, broken down as follows:\n\n(i) legal fees of Foley Hoag LLP and paralegal staff for US$ 5,260,332.42;\n\n(ii) fees and expenses of the oil and gas, environment, valuation, and Nicaraguan law experts for US$ 1,839,270.71;\n\n(iii) administrative costs for US$ 410,645.19;\n\n(iv) advance payments to ICSID for US$ 499,950.00.827\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 24.\n\n610.\n\nRespondent argues that it is entitled to recover these costs on the basis of the \"*general rule*\" applied by ICSID tribunals that the successful party receive reimbursement from the unsuccessful party.828 Thus, Claimants should pay the full costs incurred by Respondent both in case the Tribunal were to accept Nicaragua's jurisdictional objections,829 and in case Respondent prevailed on the merits.830 Finally, Respondent argues that Claimants must also bear the costs incurred to bring the Counterclaim, whether the Tribunal accepts it or not. Respondent would still be the prevailing party if the Tribunal were to dismiss the Claim regardless of the outcome of the Counterclaim, which is only ancillary to it. Further, Respondent alleges \"*it would be unjust*\" not to award it costs related to the Counterclaim, because Respondent \"*was compelled to bring its counterclaim when Claimants advanced unmeritorious claims based on the termination of the Contract*\".831\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 5 and case-law mentioned therein.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 7, relying on *Blue Bank Int'l & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20, Award, April 26, 2017, **Exhibit CLA-117**, \u00b6\u00b6 173, 209-211.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6 9.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Indeed, Respondent argues that in defending itself from the Claim, which Claimants failed to prove caused them damages, it \"*could not stand idly by and not identify damages it actually suffered and continues to suffer to this day*\".\n\n**XIII.C The Tribunal's decision on costs**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nEach Party seeks an award of the entirety of the costs borne by it in connection with the present arbitration.\n\n612.\n\nClaimants' overall costs \u2013 comprehensive of legal fees and expenses, advance payments of fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the ICSID costs, expert fees and witness expenses \u2013 amount to US$ 524,970 and \u20ac 2,912,957.30832 while Respondent's overall costs \u2013 comprehensive of legal fees, expert fees and expenses, administrative costs and advance payments to ICSID \u2013 amount to US$ 8,010,198.32.\n\nSpecifically, Claimants claim \u20ac 2,173,759.75 in respect of the fees and expenses of their international counsel, Dechamps International Law and Dr. Tariq Baloch, and \u20ac 35,884.36 in respect of those of their local counsel, Mungu\u00eda Vidaurre.\n\n613.\n\nThe estimated costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the President's Assistant, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in US$):833\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses |  |\n| Luca G. Radicati Di Brozolo, President | US$ 192,295.33 |\n| Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez de Hoz, Co-arbitrator | US$ 190,624.86 |\n| Brigitte Stern, Co-arbitrator | US$ 113,999.00 |\n| Assistant's fees and expenses | US$ 82,300.00 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | US$ 252,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses (estimated) | US$ 121,197.62 |\n| **Total** | **US$ 952,416.81** |\n\nThe costs of the arbitration have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties. The Tribunal notes that the advance payments made by the Parties and the final costs of the arbitration will be reflected in ICSID's final financial statement. The remaining balance in the ICSID case account will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments advanced to ICSID.\n\n614.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n615.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that this provision gives arbitral tribunals discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees and other expenses, between the Parties as it deems appropriate. In exercising this discretion, ICSID tribunals tend to take into account the outcome of the arbitration,834 the length and complexity of the proceedings and the parties' procedural conduct.835\n\nSee *ADC Affiliate Ltd. and ADC & ADMC Management Ltd. v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, October 2, 2006, **Exhibit CLA-46**, \u00b6 533; *Itisaluna Iraq LLC and others v.
