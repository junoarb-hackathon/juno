The Claimant says that Sistem and all of its shareholders have Turkish nationality, and this has not been contested by the Respondent. The claims are brought against the Kyrgyz Republic. The claims arise from a dispute between Sistem and the Kyrgyz Republic concerning the building and operation of a hotel in Bishkek in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n2.\n\nTurkey ratified the ICSID Convention on March 3, 1989, and the Convention entered into force for Turkey on April 2, 1989. The Kyrgyz Republic signed the ICSID Convention on June 9, 1995, but has not yet ratified the Convention.\n\n3.\n\nThere is in force a bilateral investment treaty between Turkey and the Kyrgyz Republic (the **\"BIT\"**). The BIT states, in one of the texts submitted by the Claimant, that it was \"Done at Bishkek on the day of 28/4/1992 in two authentic copies in English.\"1 That is the date also given on the UNCTAD website, which records that the BIT entered into force on October 31, 1996.2 The copy submitted by the Respondent gives the date of the treaty as \"29.04.92.\"3\n\nAgreement Between The Republic of Turkey and The Republic of Kyrgyzstan Concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, April 28, 1992, Resmi Gazete, 12 \u015eubat 1995 - Say1: 22200, at 20, submitted as Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-54. The other text of the Agreement, submitted as Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-l, is undated.\n\nTotal Number of Bilateral Investment Agreements Concluded, 1 June 2006, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, *available at* http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite\\_pcbb/docs/Kyrgyzstan.pdf. The date of entry into force of the BIT is not contested.\n\nBIT at 8, (as submitted in the Respondent\u2019s Exhibit LA-10).\n\n4.\n\nIn essence, the claim arises from a joint venture formed in 1992 by the Claimant, Sistem, and a Kyrgyz company, the Ak-Keme Joint-Stock Company **(\"Ak-Keme\"**). Sistem says that it fulfilled its obligations under the various agreements that underpinned the project, that it bought Ak-Keme\u2019s share in the project in 1999 after Ak-Keme went into bankruptcy in 1998, and that it is entitled now to operate the hotel, but was dispossessed in March 2005 by Ak-Keme (now acting with a Malaysian partner). Sistem claims that the Kyrgyz Republic failed in its duty to protect Sistem\u2019s investment. The Respondent says that Sistem was simply a contractor hired to build the hotel, that it did not fulfil its obligations, that the 1998 bankruptcy procedure and 1998 purchase by Sistem of Ak-Keme\u2019s interest were legally invalid, and that Sistem unlawfully occupied the hotel until it was recovered by Ak-Keme and its Malaysian partner in March 2005. The Kyrgyz Republic does not accept Sistem\u2019s claim.\n\n5.\n\nIt is necessary to explain the background in more detail.\n\n**Sistem\u2019s Account of the Background to the Claim**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nAccording to Sistem, the background to the claim is as follows. (This account refers only to those matters necessary for an understanding of this decision on jurisdiction and does not set out all of the allegations made by Sistem or all the responses made by the Kyrgyz Republic.)\n\n7.\n\nIn 1992 Sistem decided to make a hotel investment in the Kyrgyz Republic in collaboration with Ak-Keme. An Agreement between Sistem and Ak-Keme was signed on May 27, 1992.4 In Special Agreement No 1 of May 27, 1992, they agreed to \"jointly construct as a \u2018key delivery project\u2019 a 4 star 400 beds world class hotel in Bishkek city.\"5 The Charter of the Joint Kyrgyz-Turkish Venture **\"Ak-Keme-Pinara\"** was signed on October 16, 1992.6**\"Pinara\"** or **\"Ak-Keme Pinara\"** was the name of the hotel.\n\nAgreement Concerning Establishment and Activity of the Kyrgyz-Turkish Joint Venture, May 27, 1992 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit E-2).\n\nSpecial Agreement No. 1 for Construction of the \"Ak-Keme-Pinara\" Hotel in Bishkek city, May 27, 1992 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit E-l).\n\nCharter, Joint Kyrghyz-Turkish Venture \"Ak-Keme-Pinara\", Bishkek, Oct. 16, 1992 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit E-3).\n\n8.\n\nIn 1993 Turkey provided, via **Turkish Eximbank,** a loan to the Kyrgyz Republic of USD75 million, of which USD6 million was provided for the building of the hotel.\n\n9.\n\nThe contract for the construction of the hotel **(\"Contract No. 1\"**) was signed by Mr. **F. Yenice** for Sistem and by Mr. **R. Sarymsakov** for Ak-Keme on February 1, 1993.7 A letter dated February 3, 1993, from the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan to Sistem refers to the opening of a credit line in respect of the sum of USD6 million provided by Eximbank for the hotel project, and notes that\n\nThis project is included in the list of the projects approved by the government of the Republic of Kirghizstan and has got a positive expert conclusion of the Ministry of Economics and Finances, State Committee on Foreign Economical Affairs and National Bank of Kirgizstan [sic] and is to be financed [according] to expences culculations [sic] made by your firm and given in feasibility studies.8\n\nContract for Construction and Management of a 4 Star 400 Bed Hotel in Bishkek, Kyrghyzstan, Feb. 1, 1993 (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-10 and Respondent\u2019s Exhibit E-4) [hereinafter Contract for Construction and Management].\n\nLetter from S. Sulaimanbekov, Deputy Chairman of the National Bank of Kirghizstan, and R. Jumakanov, Chief of the Department on Foreign Affairs, Hard Currency Transactions, to Sistem M\u00fchendislik Insaat (Feb. 3, 1993) (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-11).\n\n10.\n\nThe hotel was opened on August 28, 1995. On December 19, 1995, according to Sistem, \"Ak-Keme\u2019s armed men invaded the Hotel\" and Ak-Keme informed Sistem that it would no longer take responsibility for the safety of the lives of Sistem\u2019s Turkish employees.9\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Sept. 30, 2005, para. 21; Letter from R.A. Sarymsakov, President of Ak-Keme Joint-Stock Company, to Sistem M\u00fchendislik Company (Dec. 19, 1995) (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-12).\n\n11.\n\nThe dispute was addressed by the inter-governmental **Turkish-Kyrgyz Joint Technical Permanent Committee** in 1996, which confirmed on September 13, 1996, *inter alia* that Sistem and Ak-Keme each owned \"50% [of the] shares over the hotel and the Turkish firm [Sistem] holds the operating rights for 5 years.\"10\n\nProtocol, Turkey-Kyrgyzstan Joint Technical Committee Meeting (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-14).\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent says that in 1996 Sistem\u2019s investment licence was revoked, and that Ak-Keme began to negotiate with other investors, and in particular with a Malaysian company. The Respondent further says that a joint venture was created by Ak-Keme and the Malaysian company, and that from 1998 onwards it was this joint venture that was continuing to construct the hotel.11\n\nHearing transcripts, May 31, 2007, at 63\u201464; Hearing transcripts, June 1, 2007, at 29-30.\n\n13.\n\nA Decision of the Legislative Assembly of the Kyrgyz Republic dated October 7, 2002, records that in 1996 Sistem\u2019s investment licence was taken back because it \"failed to prove [its] contributions,\" and that \"[a]s a result of this, \u2018Ak-Keme\u2019 Joint [sc., Venture] Company has stopped performance.\"12 The notice of revocation, dated April 10, 1996, states that Sistem\u2019s licence was revoked \"based on non-presentation of documents certifying the facts of investment by Turkish Founder, and informs on liquidation of Ak-Keme Pinara Joint Kyrgyz-Turkish Enterprise on the basis of documents and statement presented by Kyrgyz Founder - Ak-Keme Closed Joint-Stock Company.\"13 The 2002 Decision continued: \"Construction of the Hotel had been completed from the accounts of Kyrgyz and **Malaysian investor \u2018Biznes Fokas Sdn. Bhd.\u2019** Company. 2,000,000 USD had been spent for the completion of the construction.\"14\n\nDecision of the Legislative Assembly of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, No. 874-11, at 1 (Oct. 7, 2002) (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-23).\n\nLetter from A.

Ct. Arb. Kyrg. Rep. Dec. 10, 1998) (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-15) (emphasis added).\n\n15.\n\nThe bankruptcy arose from Ak-Keme\u2019s failure to pay its debts, including debts to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, which had guaranteed payment by Ak-Keme of loans to Ak-Keme from the Turkish Eximbank. The loans were used for purchasing construction materials from Turkey.16\n\n*Id.*\n\n16.\n\nThe decision of the Supreme Court of Arbitration records that\n\nThrough the hearing, representatives of the Government of the Republic of Kyrgyz and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kyrgyz completely supported the demands of the FGI of the URLP of the Republic of Kyrgyz; and, requested the bankruptcy of the \u2018Ak-Keme\u2019 company because payment regarding Turk Eximbank credit is a heavy burden on the state budget.17\n\nIt also records that \"[t]he representative of the defendant appeared at the court disrespectfully and left the room alone. He did not come to the following hearings.\"18\n\n*Id.* at 5.\n\n*Id.*\n\n17.\n\nSistem, already the owner of a 50% share of the interest in the hotel, subsequently purchased the remaining 50% that had belonged to Ak-Keme in accordance with the terms of the July 1, 1999 **\"Main Agreement,\"** to which Turkey, the Kyrgyz Republic, the liquidator of Ak-Keme, and Sistem were parties.19 Sistem did so by purchasing 100% of the shares in a new company **(\"Hotel Ak-Keme de Luks\"),20** established by the liquidator of Ak-Keme, to which company Ak-Keme\u2019s interest in the hotel had been transferred in accordance with the Main Agreement.21\n\nMain Agreement, July 1, 1999 (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-16; Respondent\u2019s Exhibit E-7).\n\n*See* Case No. B-400/4, Award (Bishkek Ct.

On the following day, July 2, 1999, Sistem and the Kyrgyz Republic agreed that Sistem would pay off Ak-Keme\u2019s debt to the Kyrgyz Republic.23\n\n*Id.*\n\nAgreement, July 2, 1999 (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-18).\n\n19.\n\nOn April 13, 2001, representatives of the Republic of Turkey and of the Kyrgyz Republic agreed a Protocol at a meeting of the Turkish-Kyrgyz Intergovernmental Mixed Economic Commission. The agreed Protocol, signed by Abdulhak Mehmet Cay, Turkish Minister of State, and Temirbek Akmataliev, Kyrgyz Minister of Finance, included the following statement:\n\nThe parties have affirmed their determination to fulfil the main agreement signed on July 1, 1999, in Ankara, under the guarantee of the Governments of the Turkish and Kyrgyz Republics, concerning Pinara Bishkek Hotel located in Bishkek.24\n\n*Turkish-Kyrgyz Intergovernmental Mixed Economic 2nd Term Meeting Commission Protocol,* ELECTRONIK Resmi Gazete, July 23, 2001 (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-19). References in this document to \"the parties\" are clearly references to the two States.\n\n20.\n\nSistem alleges that the Kyrgyz authorities subsequently created difficulties for the hotel\u2019s operation, for example by alleging that the hotel\u2019s construction was defective and that the hotel lacked the necessary licence.25\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Sept. 30, 2005, para. 38; Letter from K.

Yenice.27 The sole founder and member of Pinara Bishkek Co.

Karasartov, dated August 2, 2002,30\n\nOn July 24, 2002 an agreement was signed between ZAO \u2018Ak-Keme\u2019 and \u2018Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret AS\u2019 (the sole creditor of ZAO \u2018Ak-Keme\u2019 considering the agreement mentioned above).31 According to this agreement, in order to pay its debts, ZAO \u2018Ak-Keme\"s liquidator transfers all the assets that are not brought through the auction, to the Company. The total amount of the assets is 11,256,286.56 USD and 27,182,686 soms. The transfer of the foresaid assets was made considering the last auction values of them, which is 11,002,148.94 USD and 175,850 soms. This agreement was approved by ZAO \u2018Ak-Keme\"s creditors\u2019 meeting on July 25, 2002 and since then, the debt of 12,220,276.23 USD from the company to its liquidator (debt remaining from the Hotel), the debt of 27,187,686 soms and 11,256,286.56 USD from the liquidator to the company are accepted as having been paid.\n\nCase No. B-400/4, Award, at 3 (Bishkek Ct. Arb. Aug. 2, 2002) (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-27).\n\nThis appears to be referring to the agreement that Sistem take over the claims of Ak-Keme\u2019s creditors.\n\n23.\n\nIn the decision dated August 2, 2002, the liquidation of Ak-Keme was declared complete by Judge B Karasartov.32 The decision records the establishment of Hotel Ak-Keme de Luks and its sale to Sistem. It notes that the hotel was valued at USD10,570,000, and that 100% of the shares in Hotel Ak-Keme de Luks were sold to Sistem for USD12,700,000. It further notes that unpaid creditors of Ak-Keme had transferred their rights to Sistem and that\n\nAs August 1, 2002,33 \u2018Sistem Muhendislik\u2019 paid the following amounts to the mentioned legal entities: AGB Bishkek 19,039.64 USD (remaining: 6000 USD), Oktyabr Region Tax Office 1,703,986 soms34 (remaining: 4,800,000 soms), Insurance 840,000 soms (remaining 316,700 soms).

It recommended that the Government cancel the Main Agreement and other agreements made on July 1, 1999, and transfer the hotel from Sistem to a new company, formed by Ak-Keme and the Malaysian investor, within ten days.37 It also recommended collection of taxes and other sums said to be owed by Sistem to the Kyrgyz Republic, among other matters.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Sept. 30, 2005, para. 41.\n\nDecision of the Legislative Assembly of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, No. 874-11, at 3 (Oct. 7, 2002) (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-23).\n\n25.\n\nIn a letter dated October 15, 2002, Sistem said that the account given by the Legislative Assembly was inaccurate.38 A criminal investigation into the hotel was nevertheless started on the basis of the decision 874-11 of the Legislative Assembly, and pursuant to that investigation, two of Sistem\u2019s bank accounts, in the name of \"Pinara Bishkek Ltd,\" were frozen following a decision of the \"Interrogation Judge of Acute Issues\" of Bishkek City Prosecution Office on December 20, 2002.39 In the meantime, on December 10, 2002, the Constitutional Court of the Kyrgyz Republic ruled that the bankruptcy of Ak-Keme was unconstitutional and should not be executed.40\n\nLetter from Fehim Unice, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sistem M\u00fchendislik (Oct. 15, 2002) (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-24).\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 43; Decision on Usurpation of Property (Dec. 20, 2002) (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-25).\n\nDecember 10 is the date given in the freezing order dated December 20, 2002. *Id.* at 1.

During the intervening period it appears that Sistem was occupying and operating the hotel. Sistem says that it has run the hotel from 1999 until 2005 and that many official documents of the Kyrgyz Republic recognized it as an investor, so that the Kyrgyz Republic in fact treated it as an investor regardless of the revocation of its investment licence in 1996.42\n\nHearing transcripts, May 31,2007, at 26.\n\n28.\n\nSistem alleges that on March 25, 2005, Mr. Sarymsakov \"invaded the hotel with 50 armed men\" and that \"[s]ome of the invaders introduced themselves as the Public Prosecutor and the General and police, by showing their identity cards.\" Sistem sought the assistance of the authorities in ending this incursion into the hotel, and sought to prevent the use without its permission of the stamps, headings and other documentation belonging to the hotel.43\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 46-51.\n\n29.\n\nOn April 6, 2005, the Acting President and Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. Kurmanbek Bakiyev, requested the Public Prosecutor, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and National Security Committee to \"return the rights of the investor and take urgent measures in order to fulfil the previous commitments of the Government of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan.\"44\n\nLetter from K.

In particular, it asserts that Sistem was itself in serious breach of its obligations as an investor in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n35.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent says that Sistem failed to make any contribution to the project,50 and notes that Sistem\u2019s investment licence was revoked in 1996 because of its failure to prove that it had made the necessary investment.51 It regards Sistem as having been hired by Ak-Keme as contractors, not investors.52\n\nHearing Transcripts, May 31,2007, at 59, 60, 67.\n\n*Id.* at 64-65.\n\n*Id.* at 67.\n\n36.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the hotel was not completed and could not be opened in 1996.53 Sistem was essentially absent from the project during the period 1996-1999, during which time Ak-Keme continued the construction of the hotel, at first on its own and then together with a Malaysian partner which paid Ak-Keme\u2019s debts in the amount of USD2 million.54\n\n*Id.* at 66.\n\nHearing Transcripts, June 1, 2007, at 29-30.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent says that the 1998 declaration of bankruptcy in respect of Ak-Keme was unlawful, pointing to the 2002 decision of the Supreme Court.55\n\nDecember 10 is the date given in the freezing order dated December 20, 2002 (see Decision on Usurpation of Property at 1 (Dec. 20, 2002) (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-25)).

Nov. 2, 2005) (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit LA-9).\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent says that \"in 1999 Sistem again appears and somehow enters into a contract.\"57 It suggests that the 1999 Main Agreement was procured irregularly:\n\nSistem somehow managed to agree with some governmental officials to sign the [M]ain [A]greement, and it claimed it to be the ground for them to operate in the hotel.58\n\nHearing Transcripts, June 1, 2007, at 30.\n\nHearing Transcripts, May 31, 2007, at 84.\n\n40.\n\nIt also says that the Main Agreement has the status of an international agreement, and is therefore, as a matter of Kyrgyz law, subject to ratification by the Kyrgyz Government, which was not done.59 Further, it says that both the Main Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement were, in 2002, found to be illegal,60 and that it was in this context that in 2002 the Legislative Assembly passed the resolution recommending cancellation of the 1999 Agreements.\n\n*Id.* at 68-69.\n\n*Id.* at 72.\n\n41.\n\nIn its decision in the case No. 6-904, dated November 2, 2005, submitted by the Respondent, the Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz Republic determined that the July 1999 agreements under which Sistem acquired Ak-Keme\u2019s interest in the hotel were made on \"crushing terms,\"61 in the interests only of Sistem and contrary to public and State interests, and in a manner that did not comply with the requirements of Kyrgyz civil legislation. The agreements were declared to be void.\n\nCase No. 6-904, Decision at 2,3.\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent says that when Sistem was operating the between 1999 and 2005 it was doing so illegally, on the basis of the 1999 Agreements.\n\n43.\n\nSistem applied to the Bishkek Inter-District Court for an order excluding employees of the JKMV from the hotel. The application was refused in the Court\u2019s decision dated December 19, 2005,62 which noted the earlier court decisions on the invalidity of the bankruptcy procedure and the 1999 agreements.\n\nCase No. 3D-368/05mbc9, Decision (Bishkek Inter-Dist. Ct.

That amicable agreement was approved by the Bishkek City Court as of July 12, 2006.64\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at 40-41, 48-49.\n\n*See* Case No. G.D.-1945\\06gbl, Default Judgment at 1 (Bishkek Leninskiy Dist.

The case was registered by ICSID on April 12, 2006, as case No. ARB/(AF)/06/l, following extensive exchange of communications between Sistem and the Centre.\n\n47.\n\nOn June 13, 2006, more than sixty days having elapsed since the registration of the request for arbitration and the parties having not agreed on the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment, the Claimant invoked Article 9 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, under which, the Tribunal is to consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each side and the third who shall be the presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the parties. Also on June 13, 2006, the Claimant appointed Mr. Paolo Michele Pattocchi, a national of Switzerland, as arbitrator. The Respondent did not respond to correspondence from ICSID and on July 13, 2006, the Claimant invoked Article 6(4) of the Additional Facility Rules, by which the arbitrators not yet appointed would be appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council upon the request of one of the parties. The Chairman appointed Judge Nabil Elaraby, a national of Egypt, and Professor Vaughan Lowe, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrators in the case, with Professor Lowe being designated as presiding arbitrator. The Tribunal was constituted on October 26, 2006.\n\n48.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held in Geneva on November 30, 2006. The Claimant was represented by Dr. Ziya Akinci, Dr. Cemile Gokyayla, and Mrs. Karen D. Akinci of the Akinci Law Office, Istanbul. The Respondent, which had been repeatedly notified by ICSID of the date and location of the session, was not represented.\n\n49.\n\nAt the first session the Tribunal decided that it would separate questions of jurisdiction and merits, and first hold a hearing on the question of jurisdiction.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimant filed a **Memorial on Jurisdiction** on January 17, 2007.\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent filed a **Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction** on May 9, 2007.\n\n52.\n\nAt the request of the Tribunal, in order to clarify the issues in dispute as far as possible before the hearing, the Claimant filed a brief response, the **Reply on Jurisdiction,** on May 17, 2007.\n\n53.\n\nAt the request of the Tribunal, in order to clarify the issues in dispute as far as possible before the hearing, the Respondent filed a brief response, the **Rejoinder on Jurisdiction,** on May 23, 2007.\n\n54.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction was held at the World Bank offices in Paris on May 31, 2007, and June 1, 2007. Dr. Ziya Akinci, Dr. Cemile Gokyayla, and Mrs. Karen D. Akinci of the Akinci Law Office appeared on behalf of the Claimant. Ms. Indira Satarkulova appeared for the Respondent. Also attending were Mr. Fehim Yenice, Mr. G\u00fcrkan Yenice, and Mr. G\u00fcrsel Yenice, of Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S.; Mr. Ishenbay Dushenbievich Kadyrbekov, former peoples\u2019 deputy of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic and former deputy of the Legislative Assembly of the Jogorku Kenesh-Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. Leonid Nuhimovich Komarover, a former Government official, Mr. Ruslan Sarymsakov, President of the Joint Kyrgyz-Malaysian Venture LLC \"Ak Keme\" Hotel, LLC, and Mr. Nurdin Sarymsakov, former employee of the \"Ak-Keme\" Joint Stock Company.\n\n55.\n\nAfter the hearing the Parties filed comments on the transcript of the hearing and costs, within the time limits set by the Tribunal and adjusted to take account of a delay in the translation of the transcript of the hearing on jurisdiction. The Respondent filed a submission on June 3, 2007, and the Claimant filed a submission on July 6, 2007.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal has read the written submissions of the Parties and the transcript of the hearing on jurisdiction, and, after deliberation among its members, has decided as follows.\n\n**JURISDICTION**\n----------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that there are three grounds upon which the Tribunal may base its jurisdiction in this case:\n\na. The BIT, including both\n\ni. Article VII (\"Settlement of Disputes Between One party and Investors of the Other Party\"), and\n\nii. Article II (the MFN provision, under \"Promotion and Protection of Investments\").\n\nb. Article 18 of the Kyrgyz Investment Law, dated March 27, 2003\n\nc. Article 12 of the Main Agreement and Article 6 of the Share Purchase Agreement.66\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 5.\n\n58.\n\nEach basis will be addressed in turn. Before doing so the Tribunal will address the question whether the dispute falls within the jurisdiction of the ICSID Additional Facility and certain questions of general significance.\n\n59.\n\nAs was noted above,67 Turkey is a Party to the ICSID Convention, and the Kyrgyz Republic has signed but not ratified the Convention. The claim accordingly falls to be considered within the context of the ICSID Additional Facility. That Facility authorizes the ICSID Secretariat to administer proceedings between a State and a national of another State falling within the following categories:\n\n(a) conciliation and arbitration proceedings for the settlement of legal disputes arising directly out of an investment which are not within the jurisdiction of the Centre because either the State party to the dispute or the State whose national is a party to the dispute is not a Contracting State;\n\n(b) conciliation and arbitration proceedings for the settlement of legal disputes which are not within the jurisdiction of the Centre because they do not arise directly out of an investment, provided that either the State party to the dispute or the State whose national is a party to the dispute is a Contracting State....\n\n*See supra* para. 2.\n\n**The Requirements of Nationality**\n-----------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThere is no dispute that the requirements of the ICSID Additional Facility relating to nationality are met in the present case, the Claimant being a national of an ICSID Contracting party, Turkey, and the Respondent being another State, the Kyrgyz Republic, which is not an ICSID Party.\n\n**The Requirement That There be a Dispute Arising Out of an Investment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThere are two aspects to the question whether there is a dispute arising out of an investment. The first is the question whether there is an investment, and the second is the question whether the dispute arises out of the investment.\n\n***Is There an Investment?***\n-----------------------------\n\nThe Positions of the Parties\n----------------------------\n\n62.\n\nIn this case the Claimant asserts that it has made an investment in the Kyrgyz Republic, *inter alia* by constructing and operating the hotel, buying the shares in the hotel that formerly belonged to Ak-Keme, transferring know-how, and paying Ak-Keme\u2019s debts.68\n\nHearing Transcripts, May 31, 2007, at 19-20; Hearing Transcripts, June 1, 2007, at 1-4.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent denies that Sistem made an \"investment\" in the Kyrgyz Republic. It concedes that Sistem was issued by the Kyrgyz authorities with an investment licence in 1993, but says that it is not enough for the Claimant to be registered as an investor: it must also be shown that \"there were financial operations or financial activity, and contributions attracted or owned by the investor made into the economical development of the State.\"69 It says that Sistem itself made no such contributions of money, time or work to the project.70\n\nHearing Transcripts, May 31, 2007, at 52.\n\n*Id.* at 59, 60, 67.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent characterizes Sistem\u2019s role as that of a contractor, building the hotel for Ak-Keme as the employer, and funded by Ak-Keme using monies deriving ultimately from the Turkish Eximbank funds.71 It says further that Sistem failed to fulfil its obligations towards Ak-Keme, and that it was necessary to bring in other (Malaysian) investors in order to complete the hotel.72 \"Sistem [was] never [in] a position of joint investor,\" according to the Respondent.73\n\n*Id.* at 56; *cf. id.* at 60,\n\n*Id.* at 62-64.\n\n*Id.* at 64.\n\n65.\n\nDuring the hearing on jurisdiction the Respondent gave this account of the position:\n\nBy means of Ak-Keme Joint Stock Company, the hotel was constructed; by means of Kyrgyz-Malaysian company, the hotel was completed. Sistem invaded the hotel. Sistem somehow managed to agree with some governmental officials to sign the [M]ain [A]greement, and it claimed it to be the ground for them to operate in the hotel, in the Ak-Keme Hotel. They operated with profits, they took profits from the operation and management of the hotel.74\n\n*Id.* at 84.\n\n66.\n\nWhen asked by the Tribunal\n\nhow does the Kyrgyz Republic answer the objection that Sistem has as a matter of fact been carrying on economic activity for several years in the Kyrgyz Republic, to the knowledge of at least some branches of the Kyrgyz Government, without being closed down by the government?\n\nthe Respondent replied:\n\nBy referring to the [M]ain [A]greements, Sistem operated the hotel, and it claimed to have property rights and ownership of the hotel. Because there was no thorough investigation made in this case.75\n\n*Id.* at 85.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent considers that Sistem was operating the hotel illegally, having in effect ousted Ak-Keme.76 The Respondent also pointed out that the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic could not simply order Sistem to leave the hotel: the matter had to proceed through the State\u2019s courts.77 Moreover, the Respondent distinguished between the making of an investment and the carrying out of economic activity, suggesting that Sistem merely operated an already-built hotel in order to obtain profit from it, and that this \"has nothing to do with the definition of \u2018investment activity.\u2019\"78\n\n*Id.* at 87, 88.\n\n*Id.* at 85-86.\n\n*Id.* at 87.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n-----------------------\n\n68.\n\nA key question in the present proceedings is whether the Claimant is an investor which has made an investment in the Kyrgyz Republic. The question of what constitutes an investment arises in this case under the BIT and the Kyrgyz Investment Law. The Tribunal notes that it is not necessary for the existence of jurisdiction under the ICSID Additional Facility that the dispute concern an investment.\n\n69.\n\nThe ICSID Additional Facility does not define the term \"investment.\"\n\n70.\n\nThe BIT defines the term \"investment\" in Article I, as follows:\n\n2. The term \u2018investment\u2019, in conformity with the hosting Party\u2019s Laws and Regulations, shall include every kind of asset in particular, but not exclusively:\n\n(i) shares, stocks or any other form of participation in companies,\n\n(ii) returns reinvested, claims to money or any other rights to legitimate performance having financial value related to an investment,\n\n(iii) moveable and immoveable property, as well as any other rights in rem such as mortgages, liens, pledges and any other similar rights,\n\n(iv) copyrights, industrial and intellectual property rights such as patents, licenses, industrial designs, technical processes, as well as trademarks, goodwill, know-how and other similar rights,\n\n(v) business concessions conferred by law or by contract, including concessions to search for, cultivate extract or exploit natural resources on the territory of each Party as defined hereafter.\n\n3. The term \u2018returns\u2019 means the amounts yielded by an investment and includes in particular, though not exclusively, profit, interest, and dividends.79\n\nBIT at 1-2.\n\n71.\n\nThe Kyrgyz Investment Law80 defines the term \"investments\" and \"investor\" in Chapter 1, Article 1, as follows:\n\n1. Investments mean tangible and intangible assets, in particular:\n\n- money;\n\n- moveable and immoveable property;\n\n- property rights (mortgages, liens, pledges and others);\n\n- stock and other forms of participation in a legal entity;\n\n- bonds and other debenture liabilities;\n\n- non-property rights (right to intellectual property including goodwill, copyrights, patents, trade marks, industrial designs, technological processes, trade names and know-how);\n\n- any right to activity based on a license or in other form given by State agencies;\n\n- concessions based on Law, including concessions for search, development, mining or exploitation of natural resources;\n\n- profit and revenue received from investment and re-invested on the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic;\n\n- other forms of investments that are not forbidden by the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n[...]\n\n2. Direct Investments mean the holding, acquisition by an investor of not less than one third percent of stock and stockholders votes in joint stock companies registered or newly created on the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic, or any equivalent of such participation in business entities of other types and all further operations between an investor and a company which is invested to, investment of capital to the fixed assets of branches, representative offices of a legal entity created on the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n3. Investor means a subject of investment activity making his own, borrowed or attracted contributions as direct investments.\n\n[...]\n\nLaw No. 66 of the Kyrgyz Republic on Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic at 1-2 (March 27, 2003) (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-7; Respondent\u2019s Exhibit LA-27) [hereinafter Law No. 66],\n\n72.\n\nIt is in principle possible that certain economic activity might constitute an \"investment\" for the purposes of some legal instruments but not others. In the particular context of this case, however, the Tribunal finds no significant differences in the definitions of an investment under the legal instruments applicable in this case.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the initial intentions of Sistem and Ak-Keme regarding the nature of Sistem\u2019s activity in relation to the hotel project are evident from the key agreements concluded in 1992 and 1993.\n\n74.\n\nArticle 1 of Special Agreement No. 1 of May 27, 1992, between Sistem and Ak-Keme refers to their agreement to \"jointly construct\" the hotel.81 According to the Respondent, Article 2.1 of the Agreement of May 27, 1992 provides that \"Joint Venture is established with the purpose of joint construction and operation of the hotel in Bishkek city.\"82\n\nSpecial Agreement No. 1 for Construction of the \"Ak-Keme-Pinara\" Hotel in Bishkek City (May 27, 1992) (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit E-l).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission at 3.\n\n75.\n\nA third document from 1992, the Charter of the Joint Kyrgyz-Turkish Venture \"Ak-Keme-Pinara,\" signed on October 16, 1992,83 names Sistem and Ak-Keme as the members of the joint venture (\u2018JV\u2019) Ak-Keme-Pinara. It sets out in Article 2 the aim of the joint venture, which is \"joint Hotel construction and running in Bishkek.\" It then defines, in 13 sub-paragraphs, the \"Venture activity subject,\" as follows:\n\n2.2.1 Project documents for hotel construction elaboration.\n\n2.2.2 Hotel construction in Bishkek.\n\n2.2.3 Goods and raw materials export from Kyrghyzstan Republic.\n\n2.2.4 Goods, machines, equipment, technologies service and materials import for hotel construction needs and venture activity.\n\n2.2.5 Rights on ownership and utilisation of licences, technologies, \u2018know-how\u2019 etc. (acquisition) and other technical information connected with \u2018JV\u2019 acquisition, technical information exchange and technical ties development.\n\n2.2.6 Foreign tourist groups and tourists acception [sic] and service.\n\n2.2.7 Tourist service arrangement in the Republic with routes elaboration and service.\n\n2.2.8 Carrying out commercial operations not contradicting Kyrghyzstan Republic legislation.\n\n2.2.9 Advertisement and sponsor activity.\n\n2.2.10 Tourism instructors and hotel workers training.\n\n2.2.11 Consultations, marketing, brokers service and leasing service.\n\n2.2.12 Investments on countries - \u2018JV\u2019-members territories with the aim of service and assistance to foreign citizens.\n\n2.2.13 Own souvenirs production and realisation of Participants and other people\u2019s production.\n\nCharter, Joint Kyrghyz-Turkish Venture \"Ak-Keme-Pinara\", Bishkek, Oct. 16, 1992 (Respondent\u2019s Exhibit E-3).\n\n76.\n\nThese provisions point to an involvement by Sistem that goes beyond the mere construction of the hotel and extends into its operation.\n\n77.\n\nArticle 4.4 of the Charter contains a provision which reads as follows:\n\n... \u2018Sistem Muhendislik\u2019 having signed this agreement, not in the capacity of a materials supplier or a Trade Company but in the capacity of a contractor Partner during the construction stage giving services for preparing the project and its related technical supplements and documents and also for constructing the hotel will not be asked in any way to disclose itemized or otherwise the prices of an [sic] material it has to supply (due to local unavailability) for the construction, finishing and equipping the hotel.\n\n78.\n\nThis provision (in translation) distinguishes between a mere supplier of materials and a construction Partner. In the view of the Tribunal, the provision is concerned with the process of calculating the resources invested by Ak-Keme and Sistem respectively, and is intended to release Sistem in certain circumstances from any duty to itemise the value of materials that it supplies for the project. Moreover, it relates only to the construction phase and says nothing of the operation phase of the project. Whatever the precise meaning of that provision (and the Tribunal takes no position here on that question), it is plain that the reference to Sistem as a \"contractor Partner\" was not intended to characterize the nature of the entirety of Sistem\u2019s involvement in the hotel project. This provision does not, in the view of the Tribunal, lead to the conclusion that Sistem was merely a hired contractor engaged in the construction of the hotel.\n\n79.\n\nA further indication of the original intentions of Sistem and Ak-Keme regarding the nature of their venture appears in Article 1 of the contract between Sistem and Ak-Keme, dated February 1, 1993 (Contract No. 1) (in which Sistem is referred to as \"the Contractors\" and Ak-Keme as \"the Customers\"). It reads as follows:\n\n1. Subject of the Contract\n\nThe Contractors will construct as a \u2018key delivery project\u2019 a 4 star 400 beds Hotel in Bishkek on the plot supplied by the Customers and will supply technical and project documentation also a feasibility report, consultancy and assistance, supervision, training of Customers\u2019 personnel, Technical KnowHow and at completion of the Hotel will be 50% shareholder and will participate in management.84\n\nContract for Construction and Management, *supra* note 7.\n\n80.\n\nThe final words, \"and at completion of the Hotel will be 50% shareholder and will participate in management,\" again indicate an intention that the involvement of Sistem should extend beyond the construction of the hotel.\n\n81.\n\nThat reinforces the indications to the same effect in the 1992 documents, quoted above. The Tribunal considers that these documents evidence an intention that Sistem should not only construct the hotel in Bishkek but, having constructed it, should thereafter be a participant in the management and operation of the hotel.\n\n82.\n\nAccordingly, the construction of the hotel by Sistem from November 1992 onwards85 was itself an activity undertaken in contemplation of Sistem becoming a continuing participant in the management of the hotel.\n\n*See* Agreement of the State\u2019s Approval Committee, *supra* note 26, at 2.\n\n83.\n\nThe Main Agreement and Share Purchase Agreement of July 1, 1999, confirm this view. It is very clear that those two agreements contemplated that Sistem would manage the hotel for some time after the date of those agreements. This is evident from the provisions in Articles 2.2 and 3.3.1 of the Share Purchase Agreement86 under which the Buyer (Sistem)87 would remit half of the net profit from the management of the Hotel as payment for the shares purchased according to the terms of that Agreement. That arrangement also makes plain that Sistem was operating the hotel for a variable profit, and not as a contractor receiving a fixed payment. Sistem did indeed manage the hotel, up until the events of 2005.\n\nShare Purchase Agreement, July 1, 1999 (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-17).\n\nThe term \"Buyer\" is not defined in the Share Purchase Agreement, but Article 2 of the Main Agreement makes it plain that Sistem is the Buyer. This point is not controversial.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Main Agreement of July 1, 1999,88 made by representatives of Turkey, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Sistem, and the liquidator of Ak-Keme, expressly refers to the hotel project, of which Sistem was about to become the 100% owner, as an \"investment.\" The Main Agreement states in its preamble that \"[t]he investments are protected by the Treaty on \u2018Mutual Protection of Investments and Encouragement of Investments\u2019 executed in 1992 between the Republic of Turkey and the Republic of Kyrgyz.\"89 Article 6 of the Main Agreement also states that\n\nThe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic shall take all the necessary measures in order to enable all necessary activities to manage the Hotel. The Government of the Kyrgyz Republic guarantees not to demand any additional request other than applied so far, moreover, in the frame of Kyrgyz laws, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic guarantees full and sustainable protection of the investment.90\n\nMain Agreement, July 1, 1999 (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-8).\n\n*Id.* at 1.\n\n*Id.* at 7.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent says that Sistem did not actually transfer its own money or resources into the Kyrgyz Republic to build the hotel, and that there was similarly no transfer of Sistem\u2019s own money or resources into the Kyrgyz Republic in order to pay for the purchase of Ak-Keme\u2019s 50% shareholding in the hotel venture in accordance with the Share Purchase Agreement. The Respondent considers that Sistem might have become an investor if it had transferred money or resources into the State, but that it did not do so and is therefore not an investor.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share this view. It considers that Sistem made a contribution at the outset of the project, at least in the form of know-how and work on the construction of the hotel, and that it made a further contribution when it bought Ak-Keme\u2019s 50% interest in 1999.\n\n87.\n\nThe fact that those actively planning and realising the project may not be relying upon their own financial resources does not prevent them having the status of investors. It is common for projects to be funded by persons other than those who undertake the actual work of planning and realising a project. Funding may take the form of bank loans, or loans from passive investors not themselves actively engaged in the running of the project, or from international agencies, or - as here - from domestic or foreign government sources.\n\n88.\n\nIn this connection the Tribunal notes that Article 1(3) of the 2003 Kyrgyz Investment Law defines an investor as \"a subject of investment activity making his own, borrowed or attracted contributions as direct investments.\"91 \"Investment activity\" is defined by Article 1(4) as \"practical operation of investor in respect of his investments.\"92\n\nLaw No. 66, *supra* note 81, at 2.\n\n*Id.* at 3.\n\n89.\n\nSimilarly, the fact that the 1999 purchase was to be funded by repayments out of the profits of the hotel operation does not alter the fact that Sistem was paying for the shareholding out of revenues generated by Sistem by the operation of the hotel as a commercial concern.\n\n90.\n\nSistem was a 50% participant in the Joint Venture established in 1992. In 1999 it bought Ak-Keme\u2019s interest in the project, making it the 100% owner of the hotel. The Respondent argues that the 1999 Main Agreement and Share Purchase Agreement were found retrospectively to be illegal,93 and suggests that this is a further reason (in addition to the absence of any real contribution from Sistem) why the 1999 Agreements cannot support Sistem\u2019s claim to be an investor. The Respondent also considers that the illegality precludes reliance upon the undisputed fact that Sistem was, prior to what it regards as its dispossession in 2005, actually in occupation of the hotel and running it.94\n\nHearing Transcripts, May 31, 2007, at 71-72.\n\n*Id.* at 84-89.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept this analysis. As Judge (now President) Higgins pointed out in her Separate Opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case, at the jurisdiction stage it is necessary to accept *pro tern* the facts as alleged by the applicant and to decide if those facts *could* involve a breach of the relevant treaty. The equivalent step in the present case is to take the evidence put forward by the Claimant and to consider, in the light of the observations of the Respondent, whether those facts could disclose the existence of an \"investment.\" Judge Higgins observed that it is not necessary to determine that the facts actually *do* constitute a breach of the treaty when dealing with jurisdiction, and that no such determination could be made without venturing into the merits:\n\nWhat is for the merits - and which remains pristine and untouched by this approach to the jurisdictional issue - is to determine what exactly the facts are, whether as finally determined they do sustain a violation of [the treaty]; and if so, whether there is a defence to that violation.... In short, it is at the merits that one sees \u2018whether there really has been a breach.\u201995\n\n*Oil Platforms (Iran* v. *U.S.),* 1996 I.C.J. 803, 856 | 34 (Dec. 12, 1996) (Higgins, J., separate opinion) (quoting *The Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, at 23).\n\n92.\n\nIn the present case, there is no suggestion that the 1999 Main Agreement and Share Purchase Agreement are forgeries. Their effect under Kyrgyz law is disputed, but that dispute is a matter appropriate to be addressed during a consideration of the merits. So, too, is the character of Sistem\u2019s occupation and management of the hotel. These are matters that go to the heart of the substantive dispute between the Parties. However, Sistem\u2019s characterization of itself as an investor in the Bishkek hotel project prior to the events of 2005 is not based solely upon Sistem\u2019s own allegations; Sistem has substantiated this point and relied upon documentary evidence which is sufficient for the Tribunal to determine that it may proceed to consider the merits of the case if there is an instrument that gives jurisdiction over investment disputes arising between Sistem and the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal appreciates that there may be questions as to the extent to which Sistem fulfilled its obligations to Ak-Keme and to the Kyrgyz Republic in respect of the hotel project. The Tribunal considers, however, that any such failures on the part of Sistem cannot cancel out the fact that Sistem has invested in the Kyrgyz Republic, as has been explained above. Sistem having made legally binding commitments in respect of its obligations, such failures could have been addressed in the courts of the Kyrgyz Republic. But in any event, while any such failures on the part of Sistem may be relevant to questions of the value of Sistem\u2019s investment and the extent of any loss that it may have suffered, and to questions concerning the merits of Sistem\u2019s claim, they do not prevent Sistem qualifying as an \"investor.\"\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the position of Sistem in the light of the discussion in the *Bayindir* case96 of the so-called *Salini* test,97 which requires (i) that the investor make a contribution to the project, (ii) that the project have a certain duration in time, (iii) that the operational risks be shared, and (iv) that the project contribute to the host State\u2019s development. It considers that Sistem\u2019s investment satisfies all of those requirements.\n\n*See Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S.* v. *Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29), Decision on Jurisdiction of Nov. 14, 2005.\n\n*See Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A.* v. *Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4), Decision on Jurisdiction of July 23, 2001, [French original] 129 *Journal du droit international* 196 (2002), English translations of French original in 42 *1LM* 609 (2003), 6 *ICSID Rep.* 400 (2004).\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes in passing that complaints by a State that an investor has failed to fulfil its obligations under the host State law or under contractual arrangements fall clearly within the category of disputes that ICSID tribunals and BITs were intended to address. It would be inconsistent with the basic purposes of international law on the promotion and protection of investments if a tribunal otherwise properly constituted under a BIT were prevented from hearing a claim in respect of cancelled rights whenever a Respondent argued that the cancellation of the rights deprived the Claimant of its status as an investor.\n\n96.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal decides that Sistem had made an investment, in the form of its investment of know-how and services in the construction of the hotel, its operation of the hotel, its purchase of Ak-Keme\u2019s share of the participation in the project, its payment of Ak-Keme\u2019s debts, and its reinvestment of (a share of) its profits from the running of the hotel.\n\n***Does the Claim Arise Directly Out of the Investment?***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, there is no room for doubt that the dispute arises directly out of Sistem\u2019s investment.\n\n**Jurisdiction Under the ICSID Additional Facility**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly concludes that the claim falls within the scope of the ICSID Additional Facility. The next question is whether there is an instrument that confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal to determine the claim.\n\n***(a) Jurisdiction Under the BIT***\n------------------------------------\n\nArticle VII (\"Settlement of Disputes Between One Party and Investors of the Other Party\")\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nArticle VII of the BIT reads as follows:\n\nSettlement of Disputes Between One Party and Investors of the Other Party.\n\n1. Disputes between one of the Parties and one investor of the other Party, in connection with his investment, shall be notified in writing, including a detailed information, by the investor to the recipient Party of the investment. As far as possible, the investor and the concerned Party shall endeavour to settle these disputes by consultations and negotiations in good faith.\n\n2. If these disputes cannot be settled in this way within six months following the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the dispute can be submitted, as the investor may choose, to:\n\n(a) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) set up by the \u2018Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of other States\u2019, [in case both Parties become signatories of this Convention.]\n\n(b) an ad hoc court of arbitration laid down under the Arbitration Rules of Procedure of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), [in case both parties are members of U.N.]\n\n(c) the Court of Arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce,\n\nprovided that, if the investor concerned has brought the dispute before the courts of justice of the Party that is a party to the dispute and a final award has not been rendered within one year.\n\n3. The arbitration awards shall be final and binding for all parties in dispute. Each Party commits itself to execute the award according to its national law.98\n\nBIT at 18-19. The text matches the version of the BIT that appears on the UNCTAD website.\n\n*\"Disputes between one of the Parties and one investor of the other Party\"*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s status as a national of \"the other Party\" to the BIT (i.e., Turkey) is not disputed by the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is not a party to the dispute, which it characterises as a private dispute between Sistem and Ak-Keme, to be settled according to the procedures set out in the contracts between Sistem and Ak-Keme.99\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at 3-9.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept this submission. It is well established in ICSID case law that the fact that a particular action or omission may constitute a breach of contract cannot preclude the possibility that it may also constitute a breach of a BIT provision.100 In this case Sistem is claiming that the Kyrgyz Republic failed in its duty under the BIT to protect Sistem\u2019s investment. That clearly makes the Kyrgyz Republic, represented by its Government, a party to this dispute.\n\n*Bayindir* v. *Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29), paras. 148-49.\n\n*\"in connection with his investment\"*\n-------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that Sistem made an investment in the Kyrgyz Republic, and that the claim arises directly from it and is therefore certainly a dispute \"in connection with\" the investment.\n\n*\"shall be notified in writing, including a detailed information, by the investor to the recipient Party of the investment\"*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the view of the Tribunal in the *Bayindir*101 and of the Tribunal in *SGS v Pakistan,*102 that a requirement of notice such as appears in Article VII(1) is \"directory but not mandatory and jurisdictional.\" Sistem had in any event made its complaint very plain to the authorities in the Kyrgyz Republic in the letters dated March 27 and 28, 2005, from Pinara Bishkek Ltd to agencies of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic.103\n\n*Id.,* para. 99.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

The Tribunal does not accept this analysis. Nothing in the BIT limits the scope of its application to investments made after the date of signature or of the entry into force of the BIT; and in so far as the jurisdictional provisions of the BIT are concerned, they do not alter the character of acts that occurred before the BIT enters into force, but only the procedures available in respect of complaints of violations of the BIT. Furthermore, many of the acts in question in this case occurred after the entry into force of the BIT. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione temporis* is established. The question whether particular substantive obligations under the BIT did or did not apply to specific acts is a question appropriate to the merits, and not to this jurisdictional phase.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at 17-19.\n\n*The effect of the contractual dispute settlement clause*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the reference in Article 12 of the 1993 Construction Contract107 to the settlement of disputes by the Arbitration Commission of the Chamber of Commerce of the Kyrgyz Republic precludes a reference of the dispute to ICSID. It is clear and axiomatic that the dispute settlement provision in the contract between Ak-Keme and Sistem cannot affect the right of Sistem to refer disputes between Sistem and the Kyrgyz Republic, concerning the obligations of the Kyrgyz Republic under the BIT, to the procedures made available under the BIT.\n\nContract for Construction and Management, *supra* note 7.\n\nClaims are based on the BIT\n---------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe claim refers in general terms to a violation of the obligation to protect Sistem\u2019s investment.108 Article II of the BIT (entitled \"Promotion and Protection of Investments\") clearly offers a basis for Sistem\u2019s claim. There is, accordingly, a claim based upon an alleged breach of the BIT and thus within the scope of the BIT.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Sept. 30, 2005, para. 69.\n\n*\"[in case both Parties become signatories of this Convention.]\"*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction therefore depends upon Article VII(2)(a), which permits the investor to submit a dispute to ICSID \"[in case both Parties become signatories of this Convention.]\"109\n\nBIT at 5 (brackets in the original).\n\n111.\n\nThe drafting of this provision may be thought not to be entirely clear, and the appearance of brackets around the quoted words might be thought to give the text more of the appearance of a draft than of a final text. Nonetheless, this is the text of a BIT that is now 15 years old, and which has been signed and ratified by both Parties. The Tribunal must work with the text as it exists.\n\n112.\n\nThe text of Article VII(2)(a) indubitably demonstrates the common intention of the Parties to the BIT that it should be possible to refer disputes to ICSID in some circumstances. The question is, what is the effect of the words \"[in case both Parties become signatories of this Convention]\"? The Parties do not dispute that the BIT is to be interpreted in accordance with the rules of international law on treaty interpretation, as reflected in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Tribunal recalls that Article 31(4) stipulates that \"A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\"110\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties art. 31(4), May 23, 1969, United Nations, *Treaty Series,* vol. 1155, at 331, *available at* http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/l\\_l\\_1969.pdf.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that elsewhere in the BIT there are references to the \"ratification\" of treaties (Article IX(1)), and to States being \"members\" of international organizations. It cannot, therefore, ignore the fact that in Article VII(2)(a) the condition refers not to the *ratification* of the ICSID Convention by both States but to the *signature* of the Convention by both States. It would be wholly wrong for the Tribunal to re-write the text of the treaty that the Parties have adopted by substituting a reference to the ratification of the ICSID Convention for the reference to its signature.\n\n114.\n\nReading the text as it is written makes sense. Turkey was already a Party to the ICSID Convention when the BIT was signed. The provision accordingly enabled disputes to be referred to ICSID\u2019s Additional Facility if the Kyrgyz Republic subsequently signed the ICSID Convention, which it did in 1995. That is the position here.\n\n115.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction under Article VII(2)(a) of the BIT over claims based upon alleged violations of obligations arising under the BIT.\n\nArticle II (\"Promotion and Protection of Investments\" / MFN)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that it has jurisdiction under the BIT by relying solely upon Article VII. The Claimant says that the Tribunal may also found its jurisdiction on the MFN clause in Article II of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s Turkish BIT, which entitles it to rely upon the dispute settlement provisions in the Kyrgyz Republic - U.S. BIT.111 The Respondent says that the MFN clause does not allow the submission of contractual disputes to ICSID, and that the MFN clause cannot apply to the present dispute.112 It also rejects the argument that the MFN provision can confer procedural rights upon the Claimant, and argues in detail that the case-law cited by the Claimant does not support that argument.113 In view of its finding in relation to Article VII, the Tribunal does not need to decide upon the question whether jurisdiction may be established on the basis of the combined effect of the MFN clause in the Kyrgyz Republic-Turkey BIT and the jurisdictional provisions of the Kyrgyz Republic - U.S. BIT.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 8-39.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at 13-14.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at 20-37.\n\n***(b) Jurisdiction Under the Kyrgyz Investment Law***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nArticle 18 of the 2003 Kyrgyz Investment Law reads as follows:\n\n1. Investment dispute shall be resolved in accordance with any applicable procedure agreed in advance between an investor and authorized state bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic that does not exclude the use of other means of legal defense by an investor in accordance with the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n2. If such agreement is not reached the investment dispute between authorized state bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic and investor shall be resolved by conducting consultation between parties. If parties will not agree in 3 month period from the day of first written address for such consultation, the dispute shall be resolved by addressing to a court of the Kyrgyz Republic, unless one of the parties to a dispute between the foreign investor and the state body requests to consider the dispute in accordance with one of the following procedures:\n\n(a) by applying to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) pursuant to the Convention on settlement of investment disputes between states and citizens of other states or the rules regulating the use of additional means for conduct of hearings by the Secretariat of the Centre; or\n\n(b) by applying to arbitrage or an international temporary arbitral tribunal (commercial court) formed in accordance with the arbitration rules of UN Commission on international trade law.\n\n3. In the event that an investment dispute is to be resolved through arbitrage as referred to in subpoints \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 of point 2 of this Article, the Kyrgyz Republic shall waive any claim for preliminary application of the internal administrative or judicial procedures prior to referral of the dispute to international arbitration.\n\n4. Any investment dispute between the foreign and domestic investors shall be considered by the judicial bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic unless the parties reach an agreement on any other dispute settlement procedure, including national and international arbitration.114\n\nLaw No. 66, *supra* note 81, at 10-11.\n\n118.\n\nAn \"investment dispute\" is defined by Article 1(6) as \"any dispute between an investor and governmental bodies, officials of the Kyrgyz Republic and other participants of investment activity, arising in process of investment realization.\"\n\n119.\n\nArticle 18 contemplates the reference of investment disputes to an ICSID arbitral tribunal, without preliminary application to legal procedures in the Kyrgyz Republic. It must, therefore, contemplate that the Kyrgyz Investment Law will be interpreted by an ICSID tribunal. This the Tribunal will do.\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 18 is inapplicable because Sistem made no investment in the Kyrgyz Republic.115 The Tribunal has explained above that it considers the Claimant to be an investor which has made an investment in the Kyrgyz Republic. It considers the Claimant to be an investor for the purposes of the Kyrgyz Investment Law.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at 39.\n\n121.\n\nAs far as the three-month consultation procedure is concerned, the Tribunal observes that Sistem had made its complaint clear to the authorities in the Kyrgyz Republic in the letters dated March 27 and 28, 2005 from Pinara Bishkek Ltd to agencies of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic.116 Six months elapsed between the letters dated March 27 and 28, 2005 from Pinara Bishkek Ltd to agencies of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic117 and the Request for Arbitration dated September 30, 2005. The three-month consultation procedure (which the Tribunal in any event regards as directory but not mandatory and jurisdictional)118 has been satisfied.\n\nSupra note 105.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*See supra* para. 104.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 18(2)(a) is inapplicable because the Kyrgyz Republic is not a party to the dispute, which it characterises as a dispute between Sistem and Ak-Keme to which Article 18(4) applies.119\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at 41.\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept this analysis. The claims made by the Claimant are directed against the Kyrgyz Republic, not against Ak-Keme.120 The Kyrgyz Investment Law provides substantive legal rights and guarantees for investors. Those rights arise from obligations imposed upon or accepted by the Kyrgyz Republic and its agencies, such as the obligation in Article 4(4):\n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic in the person of its authorized governmental bodies, officials and self-government bodies shall abstain from any interference with economic activity, rights and legal interests of investors, except as provided by the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic.121\n\nHearing Transcripts, May 31, 2007, at 30-31.\n\nLaw No. 66, *supra* note 81, at 4.\n\n124.\n\nThe claims based on the Kyrgyz Investment Law are distinct from those based upon the BIT. The former necessarily refer to the rights, guarantees and obligations arising under the Kyrgyz Investment Law; the latter refer to the rights and obligations arising under the BIT.\n\n125.\n\nArticle 18(2)(a) provides for the possibility of the reference of investment disputes to the ICSID Additional Facility, at the option of the investor.\n\n126.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction under Article 18(2)(a) of the Kyrgyz Investment Law over claims based upon alleged violations of rights and obligations arising under the Kyrgyz Investment Law.\n\n***(c) Jurisdiction Under the Main Agreement***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nArticle 12 of the Main Agreement dated July I, 1996 reads as follows:\n\nAll the disputes arising from this Agreement shall be settled through negotiations. If the dispute can not be settled through negotiations, a committee consisting of the representatives of the Kyrgyz and the Turkish Governments shall resolve the dispute. If this committee cannot resolve the dispute either, each party shall appoint an arbitrator from their country or from another country. These arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator from a third country or from a third country that the parties agreed. The parties undertake to execute the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s award.122\n\nMain Agreement, July 1, 1999, at 3-4(Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-16; Respondent\u2019s Exhibit E-7).\n\n128.\n\nArticle 6.1 of the Share Purchase Agreement is drafted in identical terms.123\n\nShare Purchase Agreement, July 1, 1999, at 4 (Claimant\u2019s Exhibit C-17; Respondent\u2019s Exhibit E-8).\n\n129.\n\nIt is evident that this Tribunal has not been constituted in accordance with the procedure set out in those provisions. Its members were appointed in accordance with the ICSID Additional Facility rules. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not a tribunal constituted under the Main Agreement or the Share Purchase Agreement, and it does not have jurisdiction under Article 12 of the Main Agreement or under Article 6 of the Share Purchase Agreement.\n\n130.\n\nAs a result of this determination it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider the question of the validity of the Main Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement at this stage.\n\n131.\n\nThe question of whether the Main Agreement and Share Purchase Agreement may be relied upon for substantive rights in proceedings that are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as established by the BIT and the Kyrgyz Investment Law is a matter to be addressed at the merits stage.\n\n**EFFECT OF THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the observations of Judge (now President) Higgins in the *Oil Platforms* case in the International Court of Justice where she concluded, after a careful analysis of the matter, that \"[w]here the Court has to decide, on the basis of a treaty whose application and interpretation is contested, whether it has jurisdiction, that decision must be definitive.\"124 The Tribunal considers that analysis to be applicable here. Its decision on jurisdiction is definitive, and as *res judicata* is not subject to being reopened at any hearing on the merits.\n\n*Oil Platforms (Iran* v. *U.S.),* 1996 I.C.J. 803, 855 \u00b6 31 (Dec. 12, 1996) (Higgins, J., separate opinion)\n\n133.\n\nThis decision is limited to the question of jurisdiction. The result is that the Tribunal finds that it is competent to hear and decide claims based upon alleged violations of the BIT and the Kyrgyz Investment Law. It remains open to the parties to present at the merits stage arguments concerning the applicability of substantive provisions of the law.\n\n**COSTS**\n---------\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted the submissions of the parties concerning costs. It has decided that it will take no decision as to costs at this stage, but will decide on the matter at the end of the proceedings in this case.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\nFor the reasons set out above herein, the Tribunal decides, unanimously, after having reviewed the Claimant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s arguments, both as presented in writing and orally:\n\n1. that it has jurisdiction under Article VII(2)(a) of the BIT over claims based upon alleged violations of obligations arising under the BIT;\n\n2. that it has jurisdiction under Article 18(2)(a) of the Kyrgyz Investment Law over claims based upon alleged violations of rights and obligations arising under the Kyrgyz Investment Law;\n\n3. that it does not have jurisdiction under Article 12 of the Main Agreement or under Article 6 of the Share Purchase Agreement;\n\n4. that it will take no decision as to costs at this stage, but will decide on the matter at the close of the proceedings in this case."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2009-09-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn October 11, *2005,* the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received from Sistem M\u00fchendislik in\u00a7aat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.\u015e. (\"Sistem\" or \"the Claimant\") a company registered in Turkey, a request for arbitration (the Request), dated September 30, 2005, against the Kyrgyz Republic (the Respondent).\n\n2.\n\nOn October 12, 2005, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request and the prescribed lodging fee. On October 14, 2005, after the Claimant provided the Centre with contact details for the Kyrgyz Republic, the Centre transmitted copies of the Request to the Kyrgyz Republic, at the address provided by the Claimant, and to the Embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic in Washington, D.C.\n\n3.\n\nThe Request was filed under the Additional Facility Rules and invoked the consent given by the Kyrgyz Republic to arbitration under the ICSID Convention in the 1992 Turkey-Kyrgyz Treaty Concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (\"the BIT\") and the consent given to arbitration under the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules in the 2003 Kyrgyz Law on Investment.\n\n4.\n\nThe Request, as supplemented by Sistem's letters of October 14, 2005, October 21, 2005, October 31, 2005, November 25, 2005, December 6, 2005, December 30, 2005, January 23, 2006, and February 13, 2006, was registered by the Centre on April 12, 2006, as ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/1.\n\n5.\n\nOn June 13, 2006, more than sixty days having elapsed since the registration of the Request and the parties having not agreed on the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment, the Claimant invoked Article 9 of the Additional Facility Rules, under which the Tribunal is to consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each side and the third who shall be the presiding arbitrator, appointed by agreement of the parties. Also on June 13, 2006, the Claimant appointed Dr. Paolo Michele Patocchi, a national of Switzerland, as arbitrator, having on May 10, 2006, proposed Dr. Michael Buhler, a national of Germany, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent did not reply to communications from the Claimant or from the Centre, and on July 13, 2006, the Claimant invoked Article 6(4) of the Additional Facility Rules, by which the arbitrators not yet appointed would be appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council upon the request of one of the parties.\n\n7.\n\nOn October 16, 2006, the Centre informed the parties that the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Judge Nabil Elaraby, a national of Egypt, and Professor Vaughan Lowe QC, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrators in the case, with Professor Lowe QC being designated as presiding arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nOn October 26, 2006, all three arbitrators having accepted their appointments, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties that, pursuant to Additional Facility Rule 13, the Tribunal was deemed to be constituted and the proceeding to have begun.\n\n9.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held in Geneva, on November 30, 2006. At the session, the Claimant was represented by Dr. Ziya Akinci, Dr. Cemile Gokyayla, and Mrs. Karen D. Akinci of the Akinci Law Office, Istanbul. The Respondent, which had been repeatedly notified by the Centre of the date and location of the session, did not appear and was not represented.\n\n10.\n\nAt the first session, the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the proceeding, with the issue of jurisdiction to be dealt with first, established a schedule for filing of pleadings on the issue of jurisdiction and reserved April 12-13, 2007, for the hearing on jurisdiction. The Tribunal decided that Paris, France, would be the place of the proceeding.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction on January 17, 2007, in accordance with the agreed schedule. Having not received a counter-memorial on jurisdiction from the Respondent by the set deadline of March 2, 2007, the Centre sent an inquiry to the Respondent. On March 27, 2007, the Respondent advised that it had appointed a legal representative and requested that the Tribunal postpone the next step in the proceeding by two months in order to allow the Respondent's representative to submit a pleading and prepare for the hearing on jurisdiction. The Respondent also requested to transfer the place of the proceeding to Washington, D.C. On April 2, 2007, the Claimant opposed the Respondent's requests.\n\n12.\n\nOn April 4, 2007, the Centre informed the parties of the Tribunal's unanimous decision to (1) extend the deadline for the filing of the Respondent's counter-memorial on jurisdiction until May 10, 2007; (2) permit the Claimant to file a reply on jurisdiction by May 17, 2007; (3) permit the Respondent to file a rejoinder on jurisdiction by May 24, 2007; and (4) re-schedule the hearing on jurisdiction for May 31-June 1, 2007, to be held in Paris.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with the new schedule, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on May 10, 2007. The Claimant filed its Reply on Jurisdiction on May 17, 2007. The Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, on May 23, 2007.\n\n14.\n\nThe Hearing on Jurisdiction was held at the World Bank office in Paris on May 31-June 1, 2007. The Claimant was represented by Dr. Ziya Akinci, Dr. Cemile Gokyayla, and Mrs. Karen D. Akinci of the Akinci Law Office, Istanbul. Also attending from the Claimant's side were Mr. Fehim Yenice, Mr. Gurkan Yenice, and Mr. Gursel Yenice, of Sistem Muhendislik In\u0219aat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.\u015e.

Also attending from the Respondent's side were Mr. Ishenbay Dushenbievich Kadyrbekov, former peoples' deputy of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic and former deputy of the Legislative Assembly of the Jogorku Kenesh-Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr. Leonid Nuhimovich Komarover, a former Government official, Mr. Ruslan Sarymsakov, President of the Joint Kyrgyz-Malaysian Venture \"Ak Kerne\" Hotel LLC, and Mr. Nurdin Sarymsakov, former employee of the \"Ak-Keme\" Joint Stock Company.\n\n15.\n\nAs directed by the Tribunal, the Respondent filed a post-hearing submission on June 3, 2007, and the Claimant filed a post-hearing submission on July 6, 2007.\n\n16.\n\nOn September 13, 2007, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction, in which it unanimously decided that (1) it had \"jurisdiction under Article Vll(2)(a) of the BIT over claims based upon alleged violations of obligations arising under the BIT;\"1 (2) it had \"jurisdiction under Article 18(2)(a) of the Kyrgyz Investment Law over claims based upon alleged violations of rights and obligations arising under the Kyrgyz Investment Law;\"2 (3) it did \"not have jurisdiction under Article 12 of the Main Agreement or under Article 6 of the Share Purchase Agreement;\"3 and (4) it would \"take no decision as to costs at this stage, but will decide on the matter at the close of the proceedings in this case.\"4 A copy of the Decision on Jurisdiction is annexed hereto.\n\n*Sistem Muhendislik Insoot Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v.

On November 30, 2007, having heard from the parties, the Tribunal adjusted the schedule for the filing of pleadings on the merits and, on December 13, 2007, it fixed the Hearing on the Merits to be held on October 7-9, 2008, in Paris.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits on December 19, 2007, and the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits on March 21, 2008. The Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits on May 2, 2008, and the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits on June 13, 2008.\n\n19.\n\nThe Hearing on the Merits was held at the World Bank office in Paris on October 7-9, 2008. The Claimant was represented by Dr. Ziya Akinci, Dr. Cemile Gokyayla, and Mrs. Karen D. Akinci of the Akinci Law Office, Istanbul. Also attending from the Claimant's side were Mr. Fehim Yenice, Mr. Gurkan Yenice, and Mr. Gursel Yenice, of Sistem Muhendislik In\u0219aat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.\u015e. The Respondent was represented by Ms. Indira Satarkulova, a sole practitioner. Also attending from the Respondent's side were Mr. Belek Sarymsakov and Ms. Valentina Kharlamova, Respondent\u2019s representatives.\n\n20.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent made an application for the other two persons attending the hearing on behalf of the Respondent, Mrs. Valentina Kharlamova and Mr. Belek Sarymsakov to be allowed to testify as witnesses. Since this was contrary to the agreed procedure on witness examination at the hearing, the Tribunal sought the Claimant's observations. Claimant's counsel objected to Mrs. Kharlamova testifying since a witness statement had not been filed for her and sought some time to revert to the Tribunal on whether Mr. Sarymsakov, for whom a witness statement was already on the record, should be allowed to testify. After the lunch break, counsel for the Claimant announced their wish to cross-examine Mr. Sarymsakov at the allotted time on the second day of the hearing, while reiterating their objection to the proposed testimony of Mrs. Kharlamova.5\n\n*Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v.

The Tribunal has already set out certain details in its Decision on Jurisdiction dated September 13, 2007, and it does not repeat all of those details here.\n\n27.\n\nThis claim arises from a joint venture initially formed in 1992 by the Claimant, Sistem, and a Kyrgyz company, the Ak-Keme Joint-Stock Company (\"Ak-Keme\"), for the purpose of building and operating an hotel in Bishkek. The name of the hotel was the \"Pinara\" or \"Ak-Keme Pinara\" hotel. Ak-Keme went into bankruptcy in 1998. Sistem says that having fulfilled its obligations under the various agreements that underpinned the project it bought out Ak-Keme's share in the project in 1999, and thereby became the sole owner of the hotel. Sistem says that in March 2005, Ak-Keme ousted Sistem's managers and physically took control of the hotel. Sistem claims that the Respondent failed in its duty under the BIT to protect Sistem's investment. The Respondent says that Sistem was simply a contractor hired to construct the hotel, that it did not fulfil its obligations in relation to the construction of the hotel, that the 1998 bankruptcy procedure and 1999 purchase by Sistem of Ak-Keme's interest were legally invalid, and that Sistem unlawfully occupied the hotel until it was recovered by Ak-Keme in March 2005.\n\n28.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction dated September 13, 2007, the Tribunal recorded its determination that Sistem had made an investment in the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n29.\n\nIn 1992 Sistem decided to make an hotel investment in the Kyrgyz Republic in collaboration with Ak-Keme. The Respondent has submitted a translation of a short portion of the Special Agreement No. 1 of May 27, 1992, which states that Ak-Keme and Sistem agreed that they \"will jointly construct as a 'key delivery project' a 4 star 400-bed world class hotel in Bishkek city.\"6 While that wording might seem to refer only to the construction phase of the project, Sistem's involvement in the operation of the hotel is made plain in another document submitted by the Respondent. Article 2.1 of the translation of the \"Agreement on establishment and activity of Joint Kyrgyz-Turkish Venture\" dated May 27, 1992, which was an agreement made by Ak-Keme and Sistem, stated that a \"Joint Venture is established with the purpose of *joint construction and operation of the hotel* in Bishkek city.\"7\n\nSpecial Agreement No. 1 for Construction of the \"Ak-Keme-Pinara\" Hotel in Bishkek city. May 27, 1992 (Resp. Exhibit E-l).\n\nAgreement Concerning Establishment and Activity of the Kyrgyz-Turkish Joint Venture, May 27, 1992 (Resp. Exhibit E-2) (emphasis added).\n\n30.\n\nOn July 13, 1992, a Decree of the Kyrgyz Government, No. 323, approved the \"construction and joint management\" of the hotel Ak-Keme Pinara.8 The Charter of the Joint Kyrgyz-Turkish Venture \"Ak-Keme-Pinara\" was signed on October 16, 1992, and referred (in the Respondent's translation) to the aim of \"joint Hotel construction and running....\"9\n\nDecree of the Government of the Kyrgyz Rep. No. 323, July 13, 1992, para. 1 of the Respondent's translation, in Resp. Exhibit RLA 3. The Claimant's translation was submitted as CM3, and refers to \"(t]he construction... and the development of this Hotel by its constructors....'' Another translation submitted by the Respondent refers to the \"construction and subsequent joint exploitation\" of the hotel, Resp. Exhibits RCM 31, RRJ 73.\n\nCharter, Joint Kyrgyz-Turkish Venture \"Ak-Keme-Pinara\", Bishkek, Oct. 16, 1992, para. 2.1 (Resp. Exhibit E-3).\n\n31.\n\nIn 1993 Turkey provided, via Turkish Eximbank, a loan to the Kyrgyz Republic of USD75 million, of which USD6 million was provided for the building of the hotel. This was made available for the joint venture between Ak-Keme and Sistem via the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan.10 Ak-Keme drew on the loan from the Kyrgyz bank, so that the debt was technically owed by Ak-Keme to the Kyrgyz Republic. It was this debt of Ak-Keme that subsequently became the focus of the arrangements made in July 1999.\n\nLetter from the National Bank of Kyrgyzstan to Sistem, Feb. 3.1993, Cl. Exhibit CM 5.\n\n32.\n\nOn February 1, 1993, Sistem signed a contract with Ak-Keme (\"Contract No. 1\") for the \"Construction and Management\" of the hotel. In that contract Ak-Keme was described as \"the Customers\" and Sistem as \"the Contractors.\"11 Article 2.2 of the Contract provided that the contract value was USD25 million, of which USD6 million was a \"creditable sum financed by T[urkish] E[ximbank], USD 6.5 million was to be financed by Ak-Keme, and USD12.5 million was an \"amount to be covered by contractors.\"\n\nContract for Construction of a 4 Star 400 Beds Hotel at Bishkek, Respondent's translation, Resp. Exhibit RCM 2, p. 1.\n\n33.\n\nOn the same date, February 1, 1993, Ak-Keme and Sistem concluded \"Special Agreement No. 1\", which provided that the parties would \"jointly participate in the construction programme and further maintenance at the hotel.\"12 \"Special Agreement 2,\" which accompanied Special Agreement No. 1, stipulated that Ak-Keme would contribute (1) USD2,425,000 in commodities, plus (2) USD3,500,000 in construction materials, plus (3) the equivalent ruble amount of approximately USD500,000 for salaries, plus (4) USD6,000,000 \"to be paid as cash or to be received as credit as difference between 50% value of Total Hotel cost and total items 1, 2 and 3 above.\"13\n\nSpecial Agreement No. 1 On the construction of \"Ak-Keme-Pinara\" hotel for 400 persons in Bishkek, Article 3, Resp. Exhibit RCM 2\n\nSpecial Agreement 2, Resp. Exhibit RCM 2. The cash component appears to have been adjusted subsequently. See Witness Statement of Figen Mengi Teker, filed with Cl. Mem., para. 13.\n\n34.\n\nThe fact that a substantial part of the cost of constructing the hotel was to be drawn from the Turkish Eximbank does not alter the fact that this was an investment made by the Claimant, in a joint venture with Ak-Keme, or the fact that the value of the hotel project was agreed between Ak-Keme and Sistem in 1993 as USD25 million.\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that there appears to be, close to the heart of this dispute, a fundamental difference in the understanding and expectations of the parties regarding the nature of an investment. The Claimant clearly considered that it was an investor even though it was' recompensed for a substantial part of its work on the construction of the hotel by payments made by Ak-Keme from funds derived from Turkish Eximbank. It may be that the Respondent, and Ak-Keme, had some expectation that a foreign partner such as Sistem would fund its participation in the project entirely from its own monies.14 Whether or not that was the case, the Tribunal observes that it is entirely normal for investment projects to be financed by borrowed funds.\n\nSee, *e.g.,* Case B-164/4np, Writ, Sup. Arb. Trib. Kyrgyz Rep., March 18, 1998, p. 2, RLA 14, RCM 13.\n\n36.\n\nOn May 16, 1994, the Bishkek State Administration made a long-term contract with Ak-Keme for the provision of land for the hotel.15\n\nContract for Use of the Ground Area, May 16.1994, RCM 23.1.\n\n37.\n\nConstruction work proceeded, and the hotel was built. The parties do not agree upon the amounts that Ak-Keme and Sistem contributed towards the cost of construction. A \"Comparison list between the amounts in the agreement and those already realized 25.05.1995,\" which is said to have been signed by Mr. R. Sarymsakov (for Ak-Keme) and Mr. F. Yenice (for Sistem), is annexed to the Witness Statement of Mr. Fehim Yenice dated May 25, 2007. It indicates that USD19,518,750 had been expended on the project. The Respondent disputes the accuracy of that figure and points to the lack of detailed accounts and of certificates for progress payments16 that would support the alleged expenditure. Indeed, a commission was established by order of the Kyrgyz Government to consider claims made by Sistem against Ak-Keme relating to the construction of the hotel.\n\nA \"sample\" \"certificate of the progress payment,\" dated June 1.1995, was filed as CM 6.\n\n38.\n\nThe disagreements between Ak-Keme and Sistem continued into 1995. The Tribunal considers that the disagreements between Sistem and Ak-Keme concerning contributions to the hotel project are not material in the context of these proceedings, because of the events that occurred in 1999.17\n\n*See infra* para. 50 onwards.\n\n39.\n\nThere were also disagreements between the Claimant and the Kyrgyz authorities over a range of matters, including the construction standards of the hotel.18 Again, the Tribunal considers that these disagreements are not material in the context of these proceedings, because of the events that occurred in 1999.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Report of the Kyrgyz Fire Protection Dept., Aug. 17.1995, RCM 35.\n\n40.\n\nAt one stage the Claimant refurbished the Kyrgyz President's Guest Residency, which was used to accommodate distinguished guests. The Claimant says that it did so as a good-will gesture, at the request of the Kyrgyz Republic.19 The Respondent suggests that it was an attempt to bribe the Kyrgyz President.20\n\nCl Mem., para. 31.\n\nResp. Counter-Mem., para. 324; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 127, lines 10-18.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal would not have hesitated to attach the appropriate legal consequences to any proven instance of bribery or corruption. There was, however, no such proof. The refurbishment of a public, State facility is plainly not a direct bribe of any individual; nor, in the view of the Tribunal is the refurbishment in this case something beyond the reasonable scope of sponsorship or good-will gestures of the sort commonly made by companies. While the Tribunal acknowledges that gestures of this kind are made in order to enhance the reputation of the donor company and encourage its favourable reception and treatment,21 in a world where corporate sponsorship is not merely tolerated but is an accepted part of the system of funding public events and facilities, it is necessary to have a robust distinction between sponsorship and bribery.\n\nAnd, under the company laws of many States, would be *ultra vires* if they did not benefit the company in some way.\n\n42.\n\nThe OECD Convention, to which the Respondent refers,22 defines bribery as the offer, promising or giving of \"undue pecuniary or other advantage, whether directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign public official, for that official or for a third party, in order that the official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of official duties, in order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in the conduct of international business.\"23 The Tribunal regards that as a reasonable and useful definition.\n\nResp. Counter-Mem., paras. 326-27 (citing OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (Nov. 1997)).\n\nOECD Convention on Combating Bribery, Art. 1.\n\n43.\n\nIf an agreement is to be nullified, or benefits under a BIT are to be denied, because the transaction is tainted by corruption, the case needs to be clearly made out. In this context, one important element of the concept of bribery or corruption is the link between the advantage bestowed and the improper advantage obtained. In the present case Sistem had made its investment in 1993. The refurbishment occurred in mid-1995. Sistem lost control of the hotel in December 1995. Only in 1999 did it recover control. No plausible explanation was suggested as to how the refurbishment could be linked to any improper advantage. The only suggestion was that \"there is no explanation of the [1999] main agreement if there was no bribe involved.\"24\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 129, lines 14-16.\n\n44.\n\nIn some circumstances it may happen that regular payments over a period of time effectively \"buy\" the long-term goodwill of the recipient, so as to make it difficult to establish a causal link between the bribe and the advantage that it procures. But that is not the case here. This was a one-off transaction, from which no individual derived a personal advantage (the refurbishment being of the President's official accommodation); and it is not suggested that the transaction was made surreptitiously.\n\n45.\n\nMany other questions arise concerning the right of a government to raise the bribery of that government as a defence in these circumstances; but it is not necessary to address them, because no factual basis has been established which might substantiate an allegation of bribery. The Tribunal concludes that no incident of bribery or corruption has been proved in this case.\n\n46.\n\nThe hotel was opened by the President of Turkey and the Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic on August 28, 1995. It seems, however, that the relationship between Sistem and Ak-Keme had already broken down by that time. The Respondent records that since July 15, 1995, Ak-Keme had been seeking another international construction company to complete the hotel project.25\n\nResp. Counter-Mem., para. 313.\n\n47.\n\nOn December 19, 1995, Ak-Keme purported to terminate its relationship with Sistem, and in particular the contract of May 27, 1992, citing Sistem's non-performance of its obligations.26 The hotel was taken over by Ak-Keme, and Sistem was effectively excluded from participation in its management. The Kyrgyz Government appears to have bought shares in Ak-Keme around this time.27\n\n*Id.,* para. 8; RCM 11.\n\n*See* Judgment of Bishkek Interdistrict Court, June 17, 2005, RCM 47.\n\n48.\n\nThe period between December 1995 and the end of 1998 was eventful for both Sistem and Ak-Keme. Among other events, Sistem remained excluded from the operation of the hotel. In April 1996, Sistem's foreign investment license was revoked for \"non-presentation of documents certifying the facts of investment by Turkish Founder,\" and the Joint Venture was dissolved.28 Sistem's construction licence was revoked in September 1996.29 Ak-Keme formed a Joint Venture, \"Hotel 'Ak-Keme,'\" with the Malaysian company Business Focus Cdn Bhd, in January 1997.30 In March 1998, the Kyrgyz Supreme Arbitration Tribunal rejected Sistem's appeal against the revocation of its investment licence.31\n\nDecision No. 04/338 of the General Directorate of the State Commission of the Kyrgyz Rep., RLA 11.\n\nDecision No. 335 on Termination of License, Ministry of Architecture and Construction of the Kyrgyz Rep., Sept. 24, 1996, RLA 13, RCM 15.\n\nFoundation Agreement on Creation and Activity of Joint Kyrgyz-Malaysian Company Hotel \"Ak-Keme,\" Jan. 24, 1997, RCM 20.\n\nCase 6-164/4np, Writ, Sup. Arb. Tribunal Kyrgyz Rep., March 18, 1998, RLA 14, RCM 13.\n\n49.\n\nOn December 10, 1998, after earlier proceedings in lower courts, the Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Republic of Kyrgyz decided, finally and without the possibility of appeal, that \"'Ak-Keme' company shall be considered bankrupt and the liquidation procedure shall commence.\"32 In the same month Mr. Sarymsakov, the chairman of Ak-Keme, was imprisoned.33\n\nCase No. 6-400/4, Judgment, Sup. Ct. Arb. Kyrgyz Rep., Dec. 10.1998, p. 8, Request for Arb., Exhibit 15.\n\nRequest for Arb., para. 24.\n\n50.\n\nAll of these events are essentially no more than the background to what the Tribunal regards as the definitive legal basis of the relationship between the parties for the purposes of this case. That basis is found in the Agreements of July 1999.\n\n51.\n\nIn June 1999, the President of the Kyrgyz Republic visited Turkey and met the Turkish President. The Kyrgyz and Turkish delegations discussed the problems of the Sistem-Ak-Keme Joint Venture. The Claimant says that\n\n\"The Kyrgyz delegation said that Sistem's local partner, Ak-Keme was bankrupted and had left significant debts to the Government and third parties. The Kyrgyz delegation also said that they would like to invite Sistem to resume its investment in Kyrgyz. Mr. Fehim Yenice was invited for negotiations. During the meetings, the Ministers and bureaucrats representing the Republic of Turkey and the Republic of Kyrgyz were present. Sistem and the liquidator of the bankrupt Ak-Keme also participated in the meeting.\"34\n\nCl. Mem., para. 49.\n\n52.\n\nWhatever uncertainty there may be about what happened beforehand, it is certain that on July 1 and 2, 1999 three agreements of critical importance in this case were signed. These will be referred to collectively as \"the 1999 Agreements.\"35\n\nAll of the 1999 Agreements appear In Cl. Exhibit CM14.\n\n*The* *1999*  *Agreements*\n--------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe three agreements signed in July 1999 were (i) the Main Agreement, (ii) the Share Purchase Agreement, and (\u00a1ii) a third instrument titled \"the Agreement\" and also known as the Loan Transfer Agreement. The main features of arrangement established by these three agreements were as follows.\n\n54.\n\nThe Liquidator of Ak-Keme set up a new company, the \"Hotel Ak-Keme De Luks\" Limited Company, to which the whole of Ak-Keme's interest in the hotel (but not Ak-Keme's debts and liabilities)36 was transferred. Sistem agreed to buy 100% of the shares, valued at USD12,700,000, in the \"Hotel Ak-Keme De Luks\" Limited Company, and to pay for them by handing over 50% of the profits from the operation of the hotel until such time as the USD12,700,000 debt was repaid. The Kyrgyz Government transferred its own claims against Ak-Keme (which included the claim for repayment of the sums made available by Turkish Eximbank) for USD10,985,799 and 19,571,000 Kyrgyz Som to Sistem. In short, in return for future payments of 50% of its profits up to a total of USD12.7 million, Sistem took over Ak-Keme's entire interest in the hotel and became the sole owner of the hotel.\n\nMain Agreement, Art. 1.\n\n55.\n\nSome provisions of these three agreements call for further comment.\n\nThe 1999 Main Agreement\n-----------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Main Agreement37 was signed in Ankara, Turkey, on July 1, 1999 by (i) Professor Qay, Minister of State, representing the Republic of Turkey, (ii) Mr. Mederov, Chairman of the Government Estate Fund, \"acting in accordance with the instruction of the Government of the Republic of Kyrgyz dated 30.06.1999, numbered 271-P\", representing the Kyrgyz Republic; (iii) Mr. Kenesev, the liquidator of Ak-Keme, \"acting in accordance with the award dated June 30, 1999 of the Bishkek Court of Arbitration and in consistence with the Law of Bankruptcy of the Republic of Kyrgyz\" and (iv) Mr. Fehim Yenice, representing Sistem.\n\nExhibit CM 14 and exhibit RE 7.\n\n57.\n\nArticle 2 of the Main Agreement contained the following provision:\n\n\"The Liquidator of 'Ak-Keme AO' Company and the Government of the Republic of Kyrgyz guarantee that\n\n\u2022 There is no sale, pledge, dispute, mortgage or seizure on the asset of the new limited company,\n\n\u2022 All the creditors in the first and second ranks were wholly satisfied.\n\n\u2022 The interest of the other creditors shall not be damaged.\"\n\n58.\n\nArticle 8 of the Main Agreement stipulated that\n\n\"The Agreement hereby enters into force by the signature of the parties and is liable for the parties and their legal successor.\"\n\n59.\n\nArticle 11 of the Main Agreement stipulated that\n\n\"The execution of the Agreement is hereby guaranteed by the Governments of the Turkish and Kyrgyz Republics.\"\n\n60.\n\nThe list of signatories and the provisions of Articles 2, 8 and 11 are significant. They explicitly and emphatically make clear that the Respondent was committed and legally bound to guarantee the execution of the arrangement set out in the Agreement, and that it explicitly affirmed that there was no dispute concerning the ownership of Ak-Keme's share (or, by implication, Sistem's share) in the hotel. On this there is no room for any doubt.\n\n61.\n\nThe preamble to the Main Agreement records that the four signatories\n\n\"have agreed on the below mentioned issues:\n\n\u2022 By the decision of the Supreme Arbitration Court of the Republic of Kyrgyz it was held and declared that Ak-Keme Company went into bankruptcy and the liquidation is in progress.\n\n\u2022According to Kyrgyz Bankruptcy law, the liquidator is the sole legal representative of the Ak-Keme Company and has all authority for any kind of transactions regarding the assets of the debtor.\n\n\u2022The Economy Development Fund instituted under the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance is the main creditor of Ak-Keme AO.\n\n\u2022The investments are protected by the Treaty on 'Mutual Protection of Investments and Encouragement of Investments' executed in 1992 between the Republic of Turkey and the Republic of Kyrgyz.\n\n\u2022Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. (Turkey) owns 50% of the shares according to the agreement made on February 1, 1993 and also according to the Turkish Protocol dated September 13, 1996.\"38\n\nCM 14; \"The Turkish Protocol\" (Protocol of the Meeting of the Joint Turkish-Kyrgyz Technical Committee), dated Sept. 13.1996, appears as Exhibits CM 10 and CM 52.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent submitted the same translation as Exhibit RE 7, but later disputed the translation of the final sub-paragraph. It argued that the provision does not say that Sistem \"owns\" 50% of the shares but that Sistem \"has the right towards 50% of the shares of the hotel.\"39 The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to decide this issue, because the purpose and effect of the 1999 Agreements was to transfer to Sistem all the rights in the hotel that were held by Ak-Keme. As Ak-Keme and Sistem were the only parties with any legal interest in the hotel, it is plain that whatever Sistem's legal interest in the hotel before July 1999, Sistem became the sole owner of the hotel as a result of the 1999 Agreements.\n\nResp. Rejoinder, para. 84.1.\n\nThe 1999 Share Purchase Agreement\n---------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Share Purchase Agreement,40 to which Sistem and the Liquidator of Ak-Keme were the only two parties, was also dated July 1, 1999. It set out the financial basis of the arrangement. It recorded that Ak-Keme had been declared bankrupt by the Supreme Arbitration Court of the Republic of Kyrgyz, on December 10, 1998, and that in accordance with a decision of the Bishkek Arbitration Court dated December 23, 1998 the Liquidator of Ak-Keme had established the \"Hotel Ak-Keme De Luks\" Limited Company, which had taken over the assets of Ak-Keme. Further, Ak-Keme had decided to sell 100% of the shares of the \"Hotel Ak-Keme De Luks\" Limited Company. Those shares were \"appraised... by the parties\" as having a value of USD12,700,000.41 That agreement was reached against the background of a valuation report on the hotel made by a Moscow-based firm, Labrate, in May 1999, which estimated the value of the hotel as USD10.57 million.42\n\nShare Purchase Agreement, CM 14.\n\n*Id.,* Article 2.1\n\nSee *infra* para. 144.\n\n64.\n\nArticle 3.2 of the Share Purchase Agreement sets out the \"Seller's Guarantees\", and provided that\n\n\"The assets and ownership of Hotel Ak-Keme De Luks are not subject to sale, pledge, dispute, mortgage or seizure which may somehow restrict the asset and ownership of Ak-Keme De Luks Limited Company.\"\n\n65.\n\nArticle 2.2 of the Share Purchase Agreement Payment stipulated that the payment for the shares would be made \"with the remittance of 50% of the profit to be gained from the operation of the Hotel until the amount deemed by this Agreement is wholly covered.\" The payments were to be made to \"the Seller's bank account,\"43 the Seller being the liquidator of Ak-Keme.44 The third Agreement (the \"Loan Transfer Agreement,\" described below) made further provision for the modalities of payment. The conditions for repayment were modified in 2003.45\n\nShare Purchase Agreement, Art 2.2\n\n*Id.,* Preamble.\n\nSee *infra* para. 93.\n\nThe 1999 [Loan Transfer] \"Agreement\"\n------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe third agreement, simply headed \"Agreement\" but also known as the Loan Transfer Agreement, was dated July 2, 1999. Its parties were (i) the Kyrgyz Government, represented by the Chairman of the Government Estate Fund, acting in accordance with Kyrgyz Government decision 271-P of June 30, 1999; (ii) Sistem, represented by Mr. Fehim Yenice, and (iii) Mr. Kenesev, the Liquidator of Ak-Keme, appointed by a decision of the Bishkek Court of Arbitration dated June 30.1999.\n\n67.\n\nThis Agreement sets out provisions concerning the manner in which the indebtedness of Ak-Keme was to be treated. In effect, it transferred the Eximbank funding that Ak-Keme had borrowed via a loan from the Kyrgyz Government, to Sistem. The key provisions of the Loan Transfer Agreement are contained in Articles 3 and 4, which read as follows:\n\n\"3. The liquidator of 'Ak-Keme AO' Company affirmed that 'Ak-Keme AO' Company owes 10,985,799 USD and 19,571,000 [Kyrgyz] Som to the Government of the Republic of Kyrgyz.\n\n4... the Government of the Republic of Kyrgyz shall transfer its credit amounting to 10,985,799 USD (including 8,700,000 USD and 2,285,799 paid by the Government of the Republic of Kyrgyz to Turk Eximbank) and 19,571,000 Som to Sistem Muhendislik Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. The Republic of Kyrgyz shall not demand any additional interest, punishment or interest cost from Sistem Muhendislik Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. other than 12,700,000 USD.\"\n\nIn addition, under Article 5, Sistem undertook to pay USD1,249,881 to the liquidator, for the payment of Ak-Keme's debtors other than Turkish Eximbank.46 Article 12 of the Agreement stated that \"[t]his Agreement represents all the conditions of the agreement regarding the issues determined and declares the understanding of the parties.\"\n\n*Cf.,* Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, paras. 10-11.\n\n68.\n\nSistem thus took over both Ak-Keme's entire interest in the hotel and Ak-Keme's payment obligations on the Eximbank loan and its debts to other creditors for USD12.7 million payable under the Main Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement. Sistem operated the hotel through Pinara Bishkek Ltd, as \"Hotel Ak-Keme De Luks\" Limited Company (in which Sistem held 100% of the shares) was renamed on July 7, 1999.47\n\n*See* Case No. 6-904, Decision, Sup. Ct. Kyrgyz Rep., Nov. 2, 2005, RLA 9.\n\n69.\n\nThe three agreements of July 1999 initiated a new phase in Sistem's investment in Kyrgyzstan. Whatever rights Sistem may or may not have had prior to July 1999, and whatever claims or complaints the Kyrgyz Government might have had against Sistem prior to 1999, the July 1999 Agreements were an explicit and unequivocal recognition by the Kyrgyz Government that Sistem was thenceforth the sole and undisputed owner of the hotel.\n\n70.\n\nThe terms may appear to have been remarkably generous to Sistem, which was not obliged immediately to pay any monies out of its own resources but would repay the debt by sharing its future profits with the liquidator of Ak-Keme and the Kyrgyz Government.48 The fact that payments were to be spread over a period of some years after 1999 (and indeed, the 1999 Loan Transfer Agreement provided, in Article 5, that repayments on the Eximbank loan need not begin until January 1, 2002) meant that the 1999 value of those future payments was significantly lower than the nominal value.\n\nLoan Transfer Agreement, para. 5. The amount of the Eximbank loan was to be repaid to the Kyrgyz Government, in so far as Turkey did not waive its claim against Kyrgyzstan (Loan Transfer Agreement, paragraph 6). A separate sum, representing Ak-Keme's non-Eximbank debt, was to be paid to the liquidator. Both sums were payable out of future profits.\n\n71.\n\nOn the other hand, the arrangement resulted in discharge of Ak-Keme's local debts, and the operation of a four-star hotel in Bishkek which had been largely funded by Turkish Eximbank. It is not for the Tribunal to judge whether this was on balance a good or a bad deal for Kyrgyzstan. There is no evidence to suggest that the July 1999 Agreements were anything other than a negotiated arrangement freely entered into, with the knowledge and participation of the Kyrgyz and Turkish Governments, which guaranteed the execution of the arrangement.\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the 1999 Agreements were void because they were procured by bribery.49 As was explained above50 the Tribunal does not accept this submission. Similarly, as is explained below, the Tribunal does not accept that the Agreements were invalid because they had the status of a treaty and required ratification by the Kyrgyz Legislative Assembly51\n\nHearing Transcript Day 1, p. 132.\n\n*Supra* paras. 40-45.\n\n*Infra* paras. 83-85.\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent also submitted that the 1999 Agreements were invalid because of Sistem's failure to provide evidence of its payment obligations52 The Tribunal observes that a failure to perform a contractual obligation may breach the contract but it does not render the contract void *ab initio.* If it were otherwise, no party in breach could ever be held liable for the breach of contract. Moreover, the Agreements were implicitly affirmed in 2003, when a further agreement was made revising the schedule of payments due from Sistem53\n\nHearing Transcript Day 1, p. 134, lines 18-21.\n\n*See infra* para. 93 ff.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the 1999 Agreements were valid and legally binding, and created for the Claimant legal rights which can be the subject of protection under the BIT.54\n\nCertain other objections to the validity of the Agreements are considered in *infra* paras. 80-91.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent also submitted that the dispute settlement clauses in the Main Agreement and the Share Purchase Agreement \"excluded any jurisdiction of the ICSID Tribunal.\"55 Questions of jurisdiction were addressed in the earlier Decision of this Tribunal; but it is appropriate to note at this point that the dispute settlement provisions in the 1999 Agreements related to disputes arising from those Agreements. The present proceedings, in contrast, are based not upon claims of breaches of the 1999 Agreements but upon claims of breaches of the BIT. The dispute settlement provisions in the 1999 Agreements cannot deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction over those BIT claims.\n\nHearing Transcript Day 1, p. 133, lines 12-16.\n\n*Events Between* *1999*  *and* *2005*\n-------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nBetween July 1999 and March 2005 Sistem remained in control of the hotel. While Sistem's situation was relatively calm, this period was not wholly uneventful.\n\nDevelopments Building Upon the 1999 Agreements\n----------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nAt first, developments appeared to confirm and build upon the arrangements that had been made in the 1999 Agreements. In January 2000, two reports were made criticising the construction of the hotel.56 In January 2002, however, the Kyrgyz State Approval Committee confirmed that all requirements had been met and that the hotel was ready to be opened to the public.57 That step was approved by an Order of the Kyrgyz Government.58\n\nEngineering Reports, State Architecture and Construction Inspectorship, CM 16, CM 17.\n\nCM 18.\n\nCM 19.\n\n78.\n\nIn April 2001, the \"Turkish-Kyrgyz Intergovernmental Mixed Economic 2nd Term Meeting Commission Protocol,\" signed \"on behalf of the Republic of Turkey\" by Minister of State Abdulhak Mehmet Cay and \"on behalf of the Republic of Kyrgyz\" by Minister of Finance Temirbek Akmataliev, stated that\n\n\"The parties have affirmed their determination to fulfil the main agreement signed on July 1, 1999, in Ankara, under the guarantee of the Governments of the Turkish and Kyrgyz Republics, concerning Pinara Bishkek Hotel located in Bishkek.\"59\n\nCM 15. The Protocol is dated April 13, 2001.\n\n79.\n\nOn August 2, 2002, a Kyrgyz court decided that Ak-Keme's bankruptcy process was complete, that liquidation proceedings had been finalized, and that Ak-Keme was liquidated.60\n\nCase No. 6-400/4, Decision, Bishkek Ct. Arb. Aug. 2, 2002, CM 20.\n\nThe Resolution of the Legislative Assembly, October 7, 2002\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nIn October 2002, a different policy began to emerge. On October 7, 2002 the Kyrgyz National (Legislative) Assembly issued a resolution \"Regarding the governmental loss amounting to a few million USD as a result of the unheard of Agreement which is against the demands of the public and state.\"61 That resolution asserted that the Kyrgyz party (Ak-Keme) in the hotel project had contributed its 50% share of the capital but that theTurkish party (Sistem) had not fulfilled its obligations. The resolution also asserted that the 1999 \"Main Agreement which is considered as an International Treaty has not been ratified by the Parliament of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan and is legally not valid.\"62 It went on to list various complaints against Sistem.\n\nDecision of the Legislative Assembly of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, No. 874-ll, Oct. 7, 2002, CM 21.\n\n*ld.,p.2.*\n\n81.\n\nThe resolution of October 7, 2002 concluded by recording that the Legislative Assembly \"agreed... [that the] Government of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan:\n\n\u2022 Shall cancel the Main Agreement and other Agreements which were regulated on July 1st, 1999 in Ankara (Turkey) between the Republic of Turkey and 'Slstem Muhendislik' Turkish Company; and, the Government of Kyrgyzstan and the Liquidator of 'Ak-Keme' Joint Stock Company because It has not been ratified by the Parliament of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan and It Is against the demands of the public and state;\n\n\u2022 Shall compel 'Sistem Muhendislik' Turkish Company [to pay debts totalling USD 6,292,900 and 7000.000 soms;]\n\n\u2022 A new legal entity shall be established within 10 days and direction of the 'Pinara Bishkek' Hotel shall be transferred to the said entity. Following, for the assurance of the management, contribution of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan Government, 'Ak-Keme' Joint Stock Company and the Malaysian Company 'Biznes Fokus Sdn. Bhd.' To the hotel construction shall establish, [sic]....\"63\n\nThe resolution noted that the Assembly also agreed that the Kyrgyz General Prosecutor would Investigate Sistem, and that \"Parliament examination shall take place on hotels Including 'Pinara Bishkek' hotel constructed with contributions of foreign Investors.\"64\n\n*id.,* p. 3.\n\n*Id.,* p. 4.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the October 7, 2002 resolution of the Legislative Assembly Invalidated or cancelled the 1999 Agreements. In the view of the Tribunal, no matter how unpalatable the arrangements may have been to some observers, It has not been established that the 1999 Agreements were invalid when they were concluded, even as a matter of Kyrgyz law. The presumption that they were Indeed valid Is reinforced by the affirmation of the Main Agreement by both the Turkish and Kyrgyz Governments In April 2001.65\n\n*See supra* para. 78; CM 15.\n\n83.\n\nThe argument that the 1999 Main Agreement was a treaty which required ratification by the Kyrgyz Parliament cannot be accepted. First, It Is not established that the Main Agreement was a treaty. The references to It as an agreement guaranteed by the Governments of Turkey and Kyrgyz Indicates that It was essentially an agreement between Sistem and the Liquidator of Ak-Keme, with the two Governments acting as guarantors, rather than an International treaty between the two Governments.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, moreover, that even If the Agreement had been a treaty, far from Indicating that the Agreement was a treaty which required ratification, Article 8 of the Main Agreement stipulated that \"[t]he Agreement hereby enters Into force by the signature of the parties....\" The Tribunal notes that this Is consistent with the Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, Article 48 of which appears to permit the delegation by the President of the power to ratify treaties,66 and Article 58 (I) of which excepts from the Legislative Assembly's power of ratification \"cases envisaged in Article 48.\"\n\nArticle 48: 'The President of the Kyrgyz Republic has the right to transfer powers specified in subpoint 2 of point 3 of Article 46 of the Constitution to the Prime Minister, members of the Pravitel'stvo, and other officials; and also has the right to ratify international financial contracts and credit agreements signed by them.\"\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal further recalls that Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which it considers to be an accurate reflection of customary international law, asserts that \"A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty,\" subject to the provisions of Article 46 of that Convention. Article 46 reads as follows:\n\n*\"Article 46**Provisions of internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties*\n\n1. A State may not invoke the fact that its consent to be bound by a treaty has been expressed in violation of a provision of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties as invalidating its consent unless that violation was manifest and concerned a rule of its internal law of fundamental importance.\n\n2. A violation is manifest if it would be objectively evident to any State conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith.\"\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the conditions for the application of Article 46 would be met even if the 1999 Main Agreement were properly to be regarded as a treaty; and it concludes that whatever the position in Kyrgyz law, the validity of the Main Agreement cannot be impugned as a matter of international law on the basis of any alleged failure to conform to procedures set out in the Kyrgyz Constitution.\n\n86.\n\nThe resolution of October 7, 2002 was followed by two developments within the Kyrgyz Republic.\n\n87.\n\nFirst, later in October 2002 a case was instituted by Mr. Ruslan Sarymsakov and others in the Kyrgyz courts. The result was a decision, which was final and not subject to appeals, from the Constitutional Court on December 17, 2002.67 In that decision the Constitutional Court held that the High Commercial Court of the Kyrgyz Republic had exceeded its authority under the Kyrgyz Constitution when, on December 10, 1998, it had decided to reverse68 the decision of the Commercial Court of Bishkek City and held that Ak-Keme was bankrupt.\n\nDecision, Const. Ct. Kyrgyz Rep., Dec. 17, 2002, RLA 5.\n\nSee *supra* para. 49, where the \"High Commercial Court of the Kyrgyz Republic\" is referred to as the \"Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Republic of Kyrgyz\". See CM 12 for the decision of Dec. 10.1998.\n\n88.\n\nThe decision of the Constitutional Court stated that the earlier decision \"is not subject to execution;\" but gave no other indication of the consequences which would flow from it. There was, moreover, no consideration by the Constitutional Court of the factual position and no finding that Ak-Keme was not insolvent.\n\n89.\n\nIt appears that the Kyrgyz Supreme Arbitration Court then examined the question of the bankruptcy of Ak-Keme and, in a decision of January 15, 2003, directed that it should be reconsidered. It was later reported by a Kyrgyz court that \"[u]jnder new consideration on 16.01.2003 'Ak-Keme' CJSC had been repeatedly recognized bankrupt.\"69\n\nCase No. B-400/4, Judgment, Bishkek Interdistrict Ct., June 17, 2005, RCM 47. See *infra* para. 105ff.\n\n90.\n\nSecond, on December 20, 2002 the Prosecutor of Bishkek City froze two bank accounts belonging to Pinara Bishkek Ltd (and hence to Sistem). The Prosecutor did so in order to protect the property of Pinara Bishkek Ltd, in the light of the Constitutional Court's decision of December 17, 2002 which indicated that the bankruptcy of Ak-Keme was unconstitutional and should not be given effect.70 The freeze was, however, lifted by the Prosecutor four days later, because \"there remains no reason to confiscate 'Pinara Bishkek' Ltd's accounts rights.\"71 No further explanation was given.\n\nDecision on Usurpation of Property, Bishkek City Prosecution Office, Dec. 20, 2002, CM 23.\n\nDecision Regarding the Annulment of Confiscation Over the Ownership, Bishkek City Prosecution Office, Dec. 24, 2002, CM 24.\n\n91.\n\nThe legal position at the end of 2002 was, accordingly, unclear. The bankruptcy of Ak-Keme, which had been definitively established by the Kyrgyz commercial courts, was the basis for the 1999 Agreements guaranteed by the Turkish and Kyrgyz Governments. The final court ruling on that bankruptcy was declared unconstitutional in December 2002, but without either finding that Ak-Keme was not bankrupt or indicating what legal consequences flowed from the unconstitutionality of the decision.\n\n92.\n\nThe factual position at the end of 2002, in contrast, was clear. Sistem was in control of the hotel, which it was operating commercially; and it remained in that position until March 2005.\n\n93.\n\nIt is obvious that the authorities in the Kyrgyz Republic were aware that Sistem remained in control of the hotel. A full year after the decision of the Constitutional Court on the bankruptcy of Ak-Keme, on December 26, 2003, Sistem and the Kyrgyz Government agreed to revise the terms of the payment due under the 1999 Agreements. Instead of Sistem paying 50% of its profits until such time as it had made full payment, a schedule of payments was agreed.72 That schedule provided for the payment of the sum of 19,571,000 Soms In four six-monthly instalments of specified amounts between November 2003 and May 2005, and for the payment of USD10,985,799 in 35 six-monthly instalments of specified amounts between November 2005 and May 2023.\n\nRepayment Schedule of Sistem Muhendislik Sanayi ve Ticaret A.$.'s debt to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, RCM 57.\n\n94.\n\nThe Repayment Schedule, signed by representatives of Sistem and of the Kyrgyz Government, was submitted by the Respondent as an exhibit (no. 57) appended to its Counter-Memorial. Both parties accepted it is an accurate and valid document, although the Tribunal was not provided with the text of the remainder of the \"Collateral Agreement\" to which the Schedule was Appendix No. 1. It was later reported by the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance that \"Pinara Bishkek\" Ltd (the Sistem affiliate) had paid 17,428,517.57 som under the 1999 contract.73\n\nLetter from Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance to Sistem, July 12, 2005. CM 48.\n\n95.\n\nThis repayment schedule enabled Sistem to pay the 1999 contract price, interest-free, over a period ending almost 24 years after the making of the 1999 Agreements. On the other hand, the Kyrgyz Government had the benefit of knowing what sums would be paid and on what dates. The Claimant says that\n\n\"According to the 1999 Agreements, there was no time-limit for our payments as they were related to the profit margin of the Hotel. The Ministry however asked for us to complete the payment in 20 years because the Turkish Eximbank had postponed Kyrgyz's loan payments for 20 years. Accordingly, we were asked to complete our payments within 20 years. Because of this, we prepared an agreement changing our payment Schedule. This agreement was signed by the Kyrgyz Vice-Minister of Finance and [Sistem].\"74\n\nAgain, it is not for the Tribunal, which has no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the renegotiation of the payment terms, to judge whether the rescheduling was or was not a balanced and beneficial arrangement. What the 2003 Repayment Schedule does make clear, however, is that at the end of 2003 the Kyrgyz Government adhered to the 1999 Agreements and recognized Sistem's title to the hotel.\n\nWitness Statement of Fehim Yenice, para. 65.\n\n*The* *2005*  *Revolution*\n--------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThat situation appears to have subsisted until the events that gave rise to Sistem's claim in this case. In March 2005 the Kyrgyz Republic underwent a revolution. On March 24, President Akayev left the Kyrgyz Republic. On March 25, first Mr. Kadyrbekov, and later Mr. Bakiyev, assumed the office of acting President. Mr. Bakiyev was subsequently confirmed as President after Presidential elections in July 2005.\n\n97.\n\nThere was much unrest at this time. The Claimant says that the security officers at the hotel unsuccessfully sought police protection for the hotel on March 23 and 24, 2005.75 On 25 March, according to the Claimant, Mr. Sarymsakov, the former chairman of Ak-Keme, invaded the hotel with a group of around 50 armed men, seized control of the hotel, and expelled the Turkish personnel.76 It was also alleged that State officials colluded with and participated in the seizure.77 The Respondent denies that the hotel was invaded. Professor Belek Sarymsakov says in his witness statement that a group of people occupied the hotel in order to protect it from marauders, and advised the Turkish personnel to leave for their own safety.78\n\nCl.

Memorial, paras. 93-95, 239.\n\nWitness Statement of Belek Sarymsakov, parags. 78-92; Hearing Transcript Day 2, pp. 91-97.\n\n98.\n\nOn March 27 and 28, and April 2, 2005 the Claimant wrote a number of letters to the Kyrgyz Government, including letters to the Ministry of Defence, the General Public Prosecutor, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Prime Minister, and the acting President, complaining that the hotel had been seized and seeking its restoration.79\n\n*See* CM 25.\n\n99.\n\nOn April 1, 2005 the Kyrgyz State Estate Fund replied to the Claimant's letter and confirmed that according to State Registration, the owner of the Hotel was Pinara Bishkek Ltd, the affiliate of Sistem.80 On April 4, 2005 the Kyrgyz Deputy Minister of Finance wrote to the Kyrgyz Prime Minister and Deputy President. The letter briefly summarized the position, stating that under the 1999 Agreements the hotel was currently owned by Sistem, which in turn was indebted to the Ministry of Finance, and that Sistem had said that the hotel had been seized by Mr. Sarymsakov. The letter continued:\n\n\"The Minister of Finance conveys its concerns over the matter, since the aforementioned situation, in line with the Articles of Association signed on July 01, 1999, prevented 'Sistem Muhendislik' company to effect necessary payments concerning the debt and tax and insurance payments.\" Moreover; the depropriation of the property of Turkish citizens might have a negative impact on mutual efforts initiated under the framework of the Paris Club with regard to the dispensation of Kyrgyz Republic debts to Turkish Republic.... [T]he Minister of Finance demands the investigation of the situation and related institutions to be directed to inspect whether the acts of Sarimsakov R. are consistent with the law.\"81\n\nCM 26.\n\nCM 27.\n\n100.\n\nOn April 6, 2005 the Kyrgyz Prime Minister wrote to the Kyrgyz Public Prosecutor, the Ministry of internal Affairs and the National Security Committee. The note read as follows:\n\n\"1. I kindly request you to return the rights of the investor and take urgent measures in order to fulfil the previous commitments of the Government of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan.\n\n2. An investigation shall take place for those state security organs who participated in the usurpation of Pinara Hotel. A report regarding the measures is requested within 3 days.\"82\n\nThat, or a similar letter, was also sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and to the Turkish Embassy in Kyrgyzstan.83\n\nCM 28.\n\nSee Letter from the Turkish Embassy to Sistem, April 13, 2005, CM 32.\n\n101.\n\nOn the same day the Prime Minister (and Acting President), at a meeting with representatives of the international donor community,\n\n\"assured the donor community that he will take all mentioned concerns into account and specifically responded that some of the raised issues are already being addressed, for example:  \n*- Pinara Hotel, Bitel-* he gave appropriate instructions and these cases will be resolved according to law.\"84\n\nDraft Minutes of the Donor Community's Meeting with Prime Minister, Acting President of the Kyrgyz Republic Kurmanbek Bakiyev, Bishkek, April 6, 2005, CM 45.\n\n102.\n\nOn April 8, 2005 the Assistant Prosecutor of Bishkek issued an \"Order on immediate ending of unlawful actions\" to Mr. R. Sarymsakov, stating that\n\n\"You have usurped the 'Pinara Bishkek' Hotel premises on March 25, 2005 by claiming that ZAO 'Ak-Keme', administrated by yourself, was unlawfully bankrupted and that the transfer of the premises to the Turkish company was unlawful, and you are still holding the premises....\n\nAccording to article 19/2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Kyrgyz (KC GK 222, 281), property rights can not be violated; property owners rights cannot be violated by a third party's decision; and a property can only be seized against its owners will by a Court decision.\n\nBesides, according to article 183 of the Civil Code of the Republic of Kyrgyz, the Share Purchase Agreement signed between ZAO 'Ak-Keme\"s liquidator and 'Sistem Muhendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret AS' on July 1, 1999 can be annulled only by a Court decision....\n\nORDER\n\nYou are obliged to return 'Pinara Bishkek' Hotel's premises which were usurped unlawfully, in order to cure the injustice regarding 'Pinara Bishkek' LTD's property rights.\"85\n\nCM 29.\n\n103.\n\nHad this Order been implemented, no case could have been made out that the Respondent had violated its duties under the BIT. True, the Claimant had been ousted from the hotel; but the documentary record shows that the Respondent had taken steps to restore the hotel to the Claimants, to investigate the legal position, and to investigate allegations of the involvement of State officials in the events of March 25.\n\n*Developments in the Summer of* *2005*\n--------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nIn fact, the Order was not implemented. In May 2005, Sistem wrote again to the authorities requesting that the necessary steps be taken to restore the hotel to Sistem.86 It appears from a letter sent by the Kyrgyz General Public Prosecutor to Sistem, dated June 16, 2005, that Mr. Sarymsakov then appealed against the order to quit the hotel, and took the question of the ownership of the hotel to the Kyrgyz courts.87\n\nCM 25.\n\nRE 13\n\n105.\n\nOn the following day, June 17, 2005, the Bishkek Interdistrict Court issued a judgment in which it refused the claim that the Kyrgyz Department on Bankruptcy had filed on May 14, 1997 seeking recognition of the bankruptcy of Ak-Keme, and ordered that the parties be brought to their \"initial position\" and that the Kyrgyz Department of Bankruptcy \"transfer (return) movable, real estate, turnaround and money resources and others [sic] commodity-material assets of 'Ak-Keme' CJSC.\"88\n\nCase No. B-400/4, Judgment, Bishkek Interdistrict Ct., June 17, 2005, RCM 47. This court decision appears in a certified copy dated June 27, 2005.\n\n106.\n\nThe Court's reversal of the determination of Ak-Keme's bankruptcy was based upon findings that though payment documents had been submitted by the Kyrgyz Department on Bankruptcy they \"cannot serve as the proof, and the court considers these payment documents false.\" It noted the \"absence of any documents\" and of data in relation to the movement of the funds provided by Turkish Eximbank. And it said that\n\n\"[f]rom the text of a brief information as of 4.12.1998 addressed to the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, made by Department of Economic Policy of Administration of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, it follows that 'Ak-Keme' CJSC is solvent, profitable, had no debts on payments to the budget (book 11, pages 160-163 of the case).\"89\n\n*Id.*\n\n107.\n\nA further court decision, dated June 27, 2005, reached the same conclusion, and found that the 1999 Share Purchase Contract was void.90 That decision, in a hearing in which the Kyrgyz Government, though notified, was not represented, cancelled the Claimant's rights under the 1999 Agreements.\n\nDecision, Leninskiy District Ct. of the City of Bishkek, June 27, 2005, RCM 48.\n\n108.\n\nOn June 21, 2005, Mr. R.

Ct., Dec. 19, 2005, RLA 31, RCM 24.\n\n113.\n\nIn the final weeks of 2005 there were moves towards an amicable settlement of the dispute. At one such meeting, held on November 23 and attended by (among others) the Chairman of the Kyrgyz Supreme Court, the Deputy Chairman of the Kyrgyz Republic National Bank, representatives of the Kyrgyz Ministries of Economy and of Foreign Affairs and the State Committee of State Property and the Prime Minister's office, and Mr. Sarymsakov (but no representative from Sistem), it was resolved that\n\n\"The Ministry of economy and finances of the Kyrgyz Republic together with the Kyrgyz Republic State Committee on state debt management, and Joint Kyrgyz and Malaysian enterprise 'Hotel Ak-Keme' (R. Sarymsakov) and the Turkish Company 'Sistem Muhendislik' till December 5, 2005 shall conclude the amicable agreement on settlement disputes and differences, arising in connection with the activity of 'Ak-Keme- Pinara' Hotel.\"100\n\nIt was further resolved that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Foreign Affairs would assist the participation of the representative of Sistem, and the Turkish Ambassador, in the negotiations. These moves did not produce an amicable settlement.\n\nSee RRJ 74; RRJ 75.\n\n114.\n\nThe events after 2005 do not affect the scope or character of the present dispute, which had by then already crystallized, the Request for Arbitration dated September 30, 2005 having been filed with ICSID in October 2005 and registered by ICSID in April 2006. The Tribunal has, however, noted that proceedings were instituted in the Kyrgyz courts against Mr. Fehim Yenice personally and against Sistem,101 and wishes to make clear that its present award does not affect those proceedings or any other claims that the Kyrgyz Republic or private persons may have against Sistem.\n\nRLA 37; RCM 28; RCM 39; RCM 42.\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal has also noted Respondent's exhibit 23, submitted with its Counter-Memorial. This is an \"Amicable Agreement\" dated July 12, 2006 between the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance, the Bankruptcy Department of the Kyrgyz State Committee on State Property Management, and the Ak-Keme Hotel JKMV (the Joint Kyrgyz-Malaysian Venture, represented by Mr. R. Sarymsakov, which took over the running of the hotel in 2005). That document recorded the agreement that the Ak-Keme Hotel JKMV would pay the Ministry of Finance USD10,261,883.00 \"in consideration of interests accrued in the amount of 2.75 percent per annum\" and 1,001,150.35 som, in accordance with a payment schedule that ran from September 2006 until November 2016.102 That Amicable Agreement does not affect the substance of the claim in this case, but it does cast some light on the value of the hotel at that time.\n\nRCM 23. The payment schedule shows that Ak-Keme Hotel JKMV would repay USD10,261,883.00, plus USD1,481,559.36 (total, USD11,743,442.36) by November 1, 2016.\n\n116.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has read and considered the other documents, including witness statements, and the oral submissions of the parties in the present case, it does not consider it necessary to set them out at any greater length than has been done above. It turns next to its analysis of the question of liability.\n\nTHE RESPONDENT'S LIABILITY TO MAKE REPARATION\n---------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that in 1999 the Claimant became the sole owner of the hotel, and that the Claimant's ownership rights in the hotel were abrogated by the decision of the Leninskiy District Court of the City of Bishkek dated June 27, 2005, which was upheld by the decision of the Bishkek City Court dated August 30, 2005 and the decision of the Kyrgyz Supreme Court dated November 2, 2005, invalidating the July 1999 Share Purchase Agreement. The effect of those decisions was supported by the decision of the Bishkek Interdistrict Court dated June 17, 2005, annulling the bankruptcy of Ak-Keme.\n\n118.\n\nThat abrogation was effected by an organ of the Kyrgyz State, for which the Kyrgyz Republic is responsible.103 It is well established that the abrogation of contractual rights by a State, in the circumstances which obtained in this case, is tantamount to an expropriation of property by that State.104 The Court decision deprived the Claimant of its property rights in the hotel just as surely as if the State had expropriated it by decree. If the Claimant has been deprived of its property rights by an act of the State, it is irrelevant whether the State itself took possession of those rights or otherwise benefited from the taking.105\n\n*See* Article 4 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility, reprinted In J. Crawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility,* (2002), p. 94.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Award of Feb. 6, 2007, paras. 267-72.\n\nSee, *e.g.,* CME Czech Republic B.V. (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic (UNCITRAL Arb. Proc.), Partial Award of Sept. 13, 2001, paras. 591-609, *available at* http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/CME-2001PartialAwa rd.pdf.\n\n119.\n\nThat abrogation of the Claimant's property rights amounts to a breach of the Article III of the Turkey-Kyrgyz BIT, which forbids the expropriation of property unless it is done for a public purpose, in a non-discriminatory manner, and upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Those conditions are not satisfied in this case: in particular, no compensation has been paid. The Respondent is accordingly obliged to make reparation for that breach of the BIT.\n\n120.\n\nThat is not a matter between the Claimant and Mr. Sarymsakov or the present operators of the hotel. It is a matter between the Claimant and the Respondent, because the claim is based on the Claimant's losses as a result of the Respondent's duties owed to the Claimant under the BIT.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimant was deprived of all of its rights in the hotel, and the appropriate form of reparation is compensation for the value of the hotel. Article ill (2) of the Turkey-Kyrgyz BIT stipulates that in cases of expropriation compensation \"shall be equivalent to the real value of the expropriated investment before the expropriatory action was taken or became known.\"\n\n122.\n\nThe history of the investment in the Kyrgyz courts is convoluted. Two things are, however, clear beyond doubt. First, the Claimant operated the hotel and was treated by the Kyrgyz authorities as owner of the hotel from 1999 to March 2005 - and indeed, for some time afterwards, when the Kyrgyz authorities appeared disposed to take steps to restore control of the hotel to Sistem. Second, in March 2005, the Claimant lost control of the hotel as a matter of fact and, by virtue of the decision of the Kyrgyz court on June 27, 2005, the Claimant was deprived of all of the rights in the hotel which it had obtained under the 1999 Agreements.106\n\nAs was explained above, the decision was subsequently affirmed on appeal. It was upheld finally and without the possibility of further appeal by the Supreme Court on November 2, 2005.\n\n123.\n\nAs a matter of strict logic it might be said that the Claimant was deprived as a matter of law only of that part of its interest in the hotel which it gained as a result of the 1999 share purchase agreement which was invalidated by the Kyrgyz courts in 2005. In theory, the Claimant lost only the 50% interest in the hotel which, even on its own view of its legal position, it did not own prior to 1999, and which it bought from the liquidator of Ak-Keme in July 1999.\n\n124.\n\nOn the other hand, it appears that by April 2005 the former owners of Ak-Keme had formed a new joint venture to run the hotel together with a Malaysian company,107 and that by June 2005 the Kyrgyz Ministry of Economy and Finance had recognized that this joint Kyrgyz-Malaysian enterprise was the operator of the hotel.\n\nRCM 53.\n\n125.\n\nIn June 2005 a Reconciliation Report was signed by (1) A. Zhaparov of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic, (2) M. Temirbekov, the Director of the Central Treasury of the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic, (3) R. Sarymsakov, for the Ak-Keme Hotel Joint Kyrgyz Malaysian Enterprise, and (4) V. Harlamova, the Financial Coordinator of Ak-Keme Hotel Joint Kyrgyz Malaysian Enterprise. The translation of the Report submitted by the Respondent as exhibit 30 to its Counter-Memorial is headed \"Reconciliation report of share repayments by the Ak-Keme Hotel Joint Kyrgyz Malaysian Enterprise!108] to the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic according to the Agreement between Ak-Keme Joint-Stock Company and Affairs Management Department of the President's Administration and Kyrgyz Republic Government Office as consistent with the Kyrgyz Republic Government Decree #85-P dated 05/04/1995.\"\n\nl.e., the Ak-Keme Hotel JKMV.\n\n126.\n\nThe Report appears to detail \"repayments\" by the Ak-Keme Hotel Joint Kyrgyz Malaysian Enterprise between May 6, 2005 and June 20, 2005 of shares bought by the Ministry of Economy and Finance in November and December 1996, totalling USD45,000.00. The significance of the Report is that it makes plain that by late June 2005 the Ak-Keme Hotel Joint Kyrgyz Malaysian Enterprise was acting as the owner of the hotel. That is further confirmed by the conclusion of the \"Amicable Agreement\" of July 12, 2006.109\n\n*See supra* para. 115.\n\n127.\n\nThere is no suggestion that in the discussions between the Claimant and the Respondent that have taken place since the decision of the Kyrgyz Supreme Court dated November 2, 2005, either the Claimant or the Respondent has taken the position that at the present time the Claimant retains a half-share in the hotel. Indeed, there is no indication in the evidence submitted to the Tribunal that either Ak-Keme or the Ak-Keme Hotel Joint Kyrgyz Malaysian Enterprise considers that Sistem retains any legal interest in the hotel.\n\n128.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case the Tribunal considers that as a matter of fact the Claimant lost control of the hotel on March 25, 2005. As a matter of law it must be regarded as having lost its legal interest in the hotel as of June 27, 2005. Any chance of the restoration of that interest was removed by the decision of the Kyrgyz Supreme Court dated November 2, 2005. The Tribunal has accordingly decided that the Claimant's investment in the hotel was expropriated as of June 27, 2005. This, in the Tribunal's view, is the only realistic characterisation of the position.\n\n129.\n\nNonetheless, in order to remove any doubt on this matter the Tribunal emphasises that its award of compensation is made explicitly on the basis that the Claimant no longer has any legal interest in the hotel.\n\nVALUATION OF THE CLAIMANT'S LOSS\n--------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nIt is necessary for the Tribunal to determine the value of the investment of which the Claimant was deprived. Both parties were asked to submit post-hearing briefs on questions of quantum including the question, what would be the proper approach to the determination, on the basis of the documentary exhibits that are included in the documentary record already filed in this case, of the value of the Claimant's legal interest in the hotel on (a) March 24, 2005 and, if different, (b) November 1, 2005.110\n\nThe first and last dates in 2005 on which, on the facts, it might be argued that an expropriation had occurred.\n\n131.\n\nThe submissions made by the parties do not indicate a valuation upon which they are currently agreed for this purpose. The Tribunal has, therefore, to determine the compensation payable as best as it can on the basis of the documents before it.\n\n*The \"Incidental\" and \"Agreed\" Valuations*\n------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nCertain documents contain references to the \"value\" of the hotel. Some of these documents are incidental to transactions in which both parties were involved, and might be said to have been accepted, at least for some purposes, both by the Claimant and the Respondent. Thus, in 1993 the initial contract referred to a value of USD25 million; the 1999 Share Purchase Agreement valued the re-organized Ak-Keme company shares, representing Ak-Keme's half-interest in the hotel, at USD12.70 million; and the 2002 \"Approval\" of the hotel by the Kyrgyz authorities valued it at USD21.6 million.\n\n**The 1993 Contract Value**\n---------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe 1993 \"contract value\" was an agreed sum reflecting the contributions that each party would in future make to the project to build the hotel. It was fixed at USD25 million. The Tribunal does not consider that it is a reliable guide to the value in 2005 of the hotel as it was actually built. The limited usefulness of the 1993 contract value is underscored by the fact that the Claimant produced no detailed records of its actual expenditure on the project. While the Tribunal accepts that the Claimant was under no contractual duty to Ak-Keme to produce detailed records and accounts, that fact does not relieve the Claimant of the burden of establishing its case, including the amount of its losses, before the Tribunal. It is a matter of regret that no such records and accounts were forthcoming.\n\nThe 1999 Agreement Value\n------------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe 1999 Share Purchase Agreement price might appear to be a more secure basis for valuation, since it is an agreed contract price. The repayment terms of that agreement cannot, however, be ignored. Article *2.2 of* the Share Purchase Agreement provided that \"The payment in exchange of the purchased shares shall be provided with the remittance of 50% of the profit to be gained from the operation of the Hotel until the amount deemed by this Agreement is wholly covered.\" In other words, Ak-Keme's share in the hotel (in the form of shares in Hotel Ak-Keme De Luks) was to be handed over to the Claimant, but the Claimant had no immediate obligation to pay anything. The Claimant would payone-half of the profits of the hotel, which it now wholly owned, until such time as it had handed over USD12.7 million to the liquidator of Ak-Keme.\n\n135.\n\nIn addition, Article 3 of the Main Agreement dated July 2, 1999 provided for the right of the Republic of Kyrgyz to payments of USD10,985,799 and 19,571,000 Som to be transferred from the original debtor Ak-Keme to the Claimant.111 In addition, USD1,249,881 had to be paid to the Ak-Keme 'liquidator, to pay off the non-Eximbank creditors. In other words, Sistem took on Ak-Keme's debt. Article 4 of the Loan Transfer Agreement of the same date stipulated that \"The Republic of Kyrgyz shall not demand any additional interest, punishment or interest cost from (Sistem] other than 12,700,000 USD.\"112\n\nSee *supra* para. 31.\n\nCM 14.\n\n136.\n\nThe repayment schedule agreed on December 26, 2003, provided for interest-free repayments of the sums due over a period extending to May 15, 2023.113 The sums due in future can be discounted in order to give their value in present-day terms. For example, the Claimant estimates that USD200,000 due in November 2015 was worth USD67,747 in December 2007.114\n\nRCM 57.\n\n*Hotel Pinaro, Bishkek,* Valuation Report, Raymond James Turkey, Dec. 2007 [hereinafter First Raymond James Report], p. 45.\n\n137.\n\nThe Claimant estimated in the First Raymond James Report115 that the December 2007 value of the repayments of USD10,985,799 plus about 2.14 million Kyrgyz Soms (around USD53,000) which remained unpaid as of December 2007 was around USD3.6 million. According to the Claimant's view, therefore, the contract price of Ak-Keme's 50% share of the hotel, discounted back to 1999 values, would have been very much less than the USD12.7 million which was the \"value of the transferred shares\" according to the Share Purchase Agreement. The 1999 contracts appear to have transferred to the Claimant shares nominally valued at USD12.7 million in return for a schedule of payments whose overall value in 2005 terms was less than one-third of that amount. The Claimant would, of course, have had to\n\n*id.*\n\n----PAGE 117 IS MISSING----\n\n*The Parties' Valuations*\n-------------------------\n\n143.\n\nIn addition to these valuations, which were incidental to other transactions in which the parties were involved, each Party has submitted its own valuations of the hotel. The Respondent has submitted the 1999 Labrate Report and a Report from Inaudit dated September 12, 2005, supplemented by a further Inaudit Report dated December 13, 2005. The Claimant has submitted two reports by Raymond James Turkey. It is convenient first to consider the Respondent's valuations, which are earlier in date and to which the Claimant's valuations are in part a response.\n\n*The Respondent's Submissions on Valuation*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**The 1999 Labrate Report Valuation**\n-------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Respondent submitted a very detailed and closely-argued report dated May 28, 1999, compiled by Labrate, a valuation company based in Moscow. The valuation was an \"[a]ppraisal of market value for the purpose [of] the possible purchase and sale of the object of appraisal and/or for the purpose of investors attraction.\"120 It adopted the international valuation standard of a willing buyer and willing seller.121 The Report estimated the value of the hotel on the basis of a number of approaches to valuation, all based on the assumption that \"existing sub quality work\" would be eliminated and that the hotel (then incomplete) would be completed.122\n\nReport, *Market Value Estimation for \"Ak-Keme\" Hotel,* Investment Laboratory LABRATE, Moscow, May 28, 1999, [hereinafter Labrate Report], p. 5 (\"Short Description of Existing Actual Information\").\n\n*Id.,* Section 6, p. 62 (quoting \"International standards of appraisal, the Standard 1, Clause 3.1\", which appears to be International Valuation Standard 1, Clause 3.1.\n\n*Id.,* Sections 6, 7.\n\n145.\n\nOn the basis of a cost approach, assuming that a willing buyer would pay no more for the property than it would cost to build an equivalent, the Labrate Report estimated a value of USD14,020,000 as at May 1, 1999.123 On the basis of a \"profits\" approach,124 in which the present value of expected future profits is calculated, it estimated the value as USD9,300,000 as at May 1, 1999.125 That approach has the merit of focusing upon the value of the asset as a functioning business, rather than the cost of constructing it. The Labrate Report then proceeded to apply a hierarchical analysis procedure in order to arrive at an estimated market value of USD10.57 million as at 1 May 1999.126\n\n*Id.,* Section 8, para. 8.7.\n\nSimilar to the discounted cash flow (DCF) method.\n\nLabrate Report, Section 10; para. 10.5.6.\n\n*Id.,* Section 11. Paragraph 11.2.\n\nThe 2005 Inaudit Reports\n------------------------\n\n146.\n\nIn June 2005, the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Bishkek City instructed the Kyrgyz-English Joint Venture, Inaudit, to undertake an audit of the financial and economic activity of the Pinara-Bishkek Limited Company for the period July 1, 1999 to March 24, 2005.127 The Pinara-Bishkek Limited Company (i.e., Sistem)128 held the land rights for the hotel complex and operated the hotel.\n\nInaudit Reports, Bishkek, Sept. 12, 2005 and Dec. 13, 2005, RCM 38.\n\n*See supra* para. 68 and the reference to the resolution of the Municipality of Bishkek dated April 10, 2001 in the Testimonial Letter B-000262 on the Right of Temporary Usage of the Land, CM 50.\n\n147.\n\nThe Inaudit reports noted that Labrate did not have documentation for the construction of the hotel, so that its USD10.57 million valuation was only an approximate market value. They further stated that the valuation in the \"Approval\" decision of January 2002 \"should not be considered as correct,\" it being alleged that the value had been intentionally increased in order to reduce the liability of the Pinara-Bishkek Limited Company to profits tax.129 They also alleged that the accounts of the company for the years 1999-2004 had been manipulated in order to show losses and enable the Pinara-Bishkek Limited Company to avoid paying taxes.130\n\nInaudit Report, Sept. 12, 2005, p. 4.\n\n*Id.,* pp. 5-9.\n\n148.\n\nThe Inaudit reports do not cast doubt upon the Labrate estimate of USD10.57 million as an approximation to the market value of the hotel, but question only its precision. They do, on the other hand, indicate that the 2002 \"Approval\" value is fundamentally unreliable.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submissions on Quantum\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent's post-hearihg submissions on quantum takes the position that the Labrate report was an independent appraisal, and that the Claimant has not proved any increase in the value of the hotel beyond Labrate's estimate of USD10.57 million.131 Moreover, the Respondent does not accept that the Claimant would be entitled even to that amount, as in its view certain sums would have to be deducted from the value of the hotel.\n\nResp. Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, pp. 7.10.\n\n*The Claimant's Submissions on Valuation*\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Raymond James Reports of 2007 and 2008\n------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted two short reports by Raymond James Turkey (a subsidiary of Raymond James Inc., a diversified financial services holding company with subsidiaries engaged primarily in investment and financial planning, in addition to investment banking and asset management), dated December 2007 and April 2008. The first report applied three valuation methods: discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis; multiples analysis (also known as the peer comparison method); and replacement value analysis. The report stated that Sistem's accounting records concerning the hotel are held at the hotel and inaccessible to Sistem, and that it had used management accounts provided by Sistem for the three years 2002, 2003 and 2004 as \"the only available accurate, organized, and reliable data\" for determining the fair asset value of the hotel.132\n\nFirst Raymond James Report, p. 32, para. 4.2.\n\n151.\n\nOn that basis the first Raymond James report estimated the value of the hotel at the end of 2007, on a DCF analysis, as USD23,558,817.133 Using a Deal Multiple Analysis, comparing the hotel with other hotels world-wide, the estimated value was USD23,293,529.134 The estimated value based on a replacement value calculation was USD24,897,550.135\n\n*Id.,* p. 40.\n\n*Id.,* p. 43.\n\n*Id.,* p. 44.\n\n152.\n\nThe second Raymond James report addresses the valuation in the Labrate report, which it considers to be outdated in view of changes such as improvements in the hotel and macroeconomic developments in the Kyrgyz Republic between 1999 and 2005. It also states that the hotel should be considered as a \"business\" rather than as \"stand-alone real estate.\"136 The report then offers estimates of the value of the hotel extrapolating from the Labrate valuation using (a) the \"risk-free\" index of the growth rate in US Treasury bills and (b) LIBOR + 6%. Those calculations yield year-end values of respectively (a) USD13.79 million in 2004 and USD14.38 million in 2005, and (b) USD17.61 million in 2004 and USD19.39 million in 2005.137 The second report states that the growth of the value of the hotel, as a profitable and growing business, was projected to exceed both of those growth rates, thus proving the accuracy and fairness of the valuations in the first Raymond James report.138\n\n*Hotel Pinara, Bishkek,* Follow-up Report, Raymond James Turkey, April 2008 [hereinafter Second Raymond James Report], p. 4.\n\n*Id.,* p. 5.\n\n*Id.,* p. 6.\n\nThe Claimant's Post-Hearing Submissions on Valuation\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimant's post-hearing submissions on quantum adopt broadly the same approach as did its earlier submissions. The value of the hotel as of March 25, 2005 is estimated at USD19,943,486 using the DCF method, and USD24,758,861 using the replacement cost method.139 The value of the hotel on November 1, 2005 is estimated at USD20,710,423 using the DCF method, and USD24,758,861 using the replacement cost method.140\n\nCl. Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, p. 19.\n\n*Id.,* p. 32.\n\n*THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS*\n-------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal is conscious of the desirability for conceptual clarity in valuing assets for the purposes of calculating compensation payable; and it is conscious of the criticism of \"triangulation\" methods, which select a figure that lies somewhere in the middle ground of estimates put forward by the parties.\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal is also aware of the fact that all valuations in the absence of an actual sale are estimates, and is mindful of the fact that the Tribunal has a legal duty to render an award under a process which the Respondent has freely agreed to establish and the Claimant has freely chosen to pursue, and to do so on the basis of the material that the parties have decided to put before it. That is, necessarily, an exercise in the art of the possible; and the Tribunal has sought to arrive at a rational and fair estimate, in accordance with the BIT, of the loss sustained by the Claimant rather than to engage in a search for the chimera of a sum that is a uniquely and indisputably correct determination of the value of what the Claimant lost. The Tribunal derives some comfort from Immanuel Kant's observation that \"Out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing was ever made.\"\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal is obliged by the BIT to determine the \"real value of the expropriated investment.\" It has approached this task by asking first, which valuation method most closely corresponds to that standard of compensation, and second, whether there is adequate evidence to generate a valuation according to that method. If there is not adequate evidence to support a valuation based on the appropriate method, the Tribunal will have to proceed to a third stage and ask what rational and reasonable valuations can be derived from the available evidence.\n\nThe Appropriate Method of Valuation\n-----------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nIn deciding between available methods of valuation, the Tribunal is in the first place conscious of the distinction between cost-based valuations that focus on the value of what the investor has invested and lost, and profit-based approaches that focus on the value of the asset and the expected profits that the investor has lost - that is, the distinction between what the asset cost and what it was worth.\n\n158.\n\nWhatever might be the position in relation to breaches of duties of Fair and Equitable Treatment or Non-Discrimination or Full Protection and Security, in cases where the breach takes the form of an expropriation compensation will generally be assessed by reference to the value of the property or rights of which the Claimant was wrongly deprived: that is what the property was worth. The oft-repeated *Chorzow Factory* formula refers to\n\n\"the obligation to restore the undertaking and, if this be not possible, to pay its value at the time of the indemnification, which value is designed to take the place of restitution which has become impossible. To this obligation, in virtue of the general principles of international law, must be added that of compensating loss sustained as a result of the seizure.\"141\n\nIt is questionable whether an arbitral tribunal has the power to order a State to restore expropriated property to its original owner. In any event, restoration of expropriated property is plainly no longer the primary judicial remedy in cases of expropriation, if it ever was. Monetary compensation is the normal remedy, and its role is precisely \"to take the place of restitution.\"\n\nCase Concerning the Factory at Chorzow (Claim for Indemnity) (Germany v. Poland), 1928 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 17 (13 Sept.), p. 48.\n\n159.\n\nMonetary compensation will \"take the place of restitution\" if the investor's periodical receipts are the same as they would have been if the investor had remained in possession and control of the property. If investors are given compensation which represents a net income stream that is the same as that which the investor could rationally and reasonably have expected, at the time of the taking, to derive from the expropriated investment, and which also reflects the residual value of the investment that would have generated that income stream, then that compensation will ordinarily discharge the liability of the State.\n\nThe Replacement Value Approach\n------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThe \"replacement value\" approach to valuation looks to what the investor has put in, not what the investor could expect to derive from the investment - at what the investment cost rather than at what it was worth. But there is no necessary relationship between cost and value.142 It may take some years before an investment builds up a reputation and turnover which raises its value above the amount that was needed to create it. Indeed, it may never rise to that value; and if that is so, it is not the role of a BIT to turn a bad investment into a good one. The investment was worth what it was worth, regardless of how much it cost.\n\nAs the Second Raymond James Report points out (pp. 10-11; para. 20).\n\n161.\n\nIn the context of expropriation, replacement cost is therefore less helpful than a valuation based upon expected profits. (The application of a costs approach in this case would, moreover, be impeded by the surprising inability of the Claimant to produce detailed records of the costs incurred in the hotel project.) In contrast, because buyers of businesses can be expected to value them according to the profit that they will generate, rather than the cost of creating them, the \"multiple deals\" approach to valuation, and the DCF method, appears more appropriate in this context than the \"replacement value\" approach. The Tribunal considers the replacement value approach inappropriate in the circumstances of this case.\n\nThe Multiple Deals Approach\n---------------------------\n\n162.\n\nIn this case the Tribunal is not persuaded that there is an adequate basis for the application of the \"multiple deals\" approach. Conditions in the Kyrgyz hotel sector in the period in question are not so obviously comparable with the comparators in Ireland, Sweden, the UK, the USA, and the other States to which the first Raymond James report makes reference143 as to persuade the Tribunal, without more, that these comparators offer a sound basis for comparison and extrapolation. The fact that the Raymond James report states that \"there are almost no completed transactions in the Central Asian region with accurate transaction data\" and that \"[i]n addition, 30% discount is applied on the deal multiples to normalize the multiple for the Kyrgyzstan market\"144 reinforces the view that the valuation based on this approach involves a large measure of speculation.\n\nFirst Raymond James Report, p. 42.\n\n*Id.,* p. 43.\n\n163.\n\nAccordingly, while the \"multiples\" approach would in principle be an appropriate approach to valuation in the circumstances of this case, there is inadequate information to which that approach could be applied.\n\n**The DCF Method**\n------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it clear that the DCF or \"profits\" approach is appropriate in the circumstances of this case. Many tribunals have observed that it is appropriate to follow the World Bank's approach to valuation in the circumstances of expropriation, assessing the\n\n\"amount that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller after taking into account the nature of the investment, the circumstances in which it would operate in the future and its specific characteristics, including the period in which it would operate in the future and its specific characteristics, including the period in which it has been in existence, the proportion of tangible assets in the total investment and other relevant factors pertinent to the specific circumstances of each case.\"145\n\nWhile the available data is sparse, both parties appear to have considered that the data is sufficient for the DCF approach to be applied and to yield a reasonable estimate of the value of the hotel and of the compensation due.\n\nWorld Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct investment, 1992. Guideline IV.\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimant used the DCF approach to generate an estimated value of the hotel on November 1, 2005 of USD 20,710,423.146 The Respondent's Labrate Report used a \"profits\" approach to generate an initial estimated value of USD9,300,000, but adjusted that to produce an estimated market value of USD10.57 million, as at May 1, 1999.\n\nCl. Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, p. 32\n\n166.\n\nThe Labrate analysis appears thorough and clear as to its assumptions and reasoning. It is true that the Labrate estimate cannot be regarded as a perfect basis from which to derive an estimate of the value of the hotel in 2005. The most obvious difficulties in relying upon the Labrate report for that purpose are that the hotel had not been completed in 1999, and that the Labrate \"profits\" calculation did not have the benefit of actual operating turnover figures from which to work. Nonetheless, the Labrate report appears to have been carefully calculated.\n\n167.\n\nThe Raymond James Turkey reports are also produced by a skilled professional team. Their projections are based on variables such as growth in GDP (estimated at 6.60% for 2008), growth in the share of GDP taken by tourism (from 3.5% in 2005 to 10% in 2017) and inflation (expected to remain within the 6%-8% range until 2017). They yield significantly higher DCF valuations than does the Labrate report, although that difference is greatly reduced when the eight year difference in valuation dates is taken into account.\n\n168.\n\nGiven the conflicting nature of the available data, the Tribunal has preferred to work from the basis of the Labrate figure of USD10.57 million as of May 1999. While it relates to an earlier time, it appears to have a firmer base for its calculations than the Raymond James figures, where assumptions concerning future variables indicate the possibility of a significant margin of error. Most importantly, the Tribunal notes that in the second Raymond James Report, submitted by the Claimant, it is said that\n\n\"The share purchase agreement was signed by Sistem Muhendislik in 1999 based on the value of the hotel at that time, which was agreed as USD10,570,000.\"147\n\nSecond Raymond James Report, para. 13.\n\n169.\n\nThe same figure is also accepted by the Respondent as a broadly accurate valuation as of 1999. Thus, the Labrate figure is the most recent to have been accepted by both parties. Given the conflicting evidence on who paid for and effected the post-1999 improvements in the hotel, the Tribunal considers that the Labrate valuation of USD10.57 million provides the most secure evidential basis from which to begin work on the determination of compensation.\n\nIncreases in Value Since 1999\n-----------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe value of the hotel being thus fixed at USD10.57 million on May 1, 1999, the next question is whether the hotel has been shown to have been worth more than USD10.57 million six years later, in June 2005.\n\n171.\n\nThere is no reason to suppose that the hotel declined in value between 1999 and 2005. On the contrary, there is no doubt that the fabric of the hotel was improved and that the hotel began to operate successfully. There is, however, a great shortage of reliable and compelling evidence of the financial position of the hotel.\n\n172.\n\nAs far as the evidence submitted by the Claimant is concerned, the Raymond James Turkey reports used management accounts for 2002-2004 and, adopting the DCF approach, produced a value which the Claimant has recalculated to a November 2005 value for the hotel of USD20,710,423. The Respondent submits that there is no evidence that in 2005 the hotel was worth more than the 1999 value of USD10.57 million.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered what evidence there is of an increase in the value of the hotel between 1999 and 2005. The first Raymond James Report148 was based on only three years' figures and shows a mixed picture as far as the growth of the hotel was concerned. Room occupancy fluctuated: in 2002 it was 63.65%; in 2003, 60.64%; in 2004, 61.49%. Average room revenue increased over the period, from USD55.04 to USD61.48. Some costs fell, but others increased; and the same is true of the various sources of revenue. Similarly, the figures in the Inaudit report show an unsettled picture of profits and losses during this period. The 2002 \"Approval\" valuation of USD21,670,000, in contrast, was a cost-based estimate, and not a profits-based estimate, and is for that reason unreliable as an indication of market value. While these figures certainly do not indicate that the hotel was failing to establish itself in the Kyrgyz market, the Tribunal does not consider that it is possible to draw a robust inference from them concerning the market value of the hotel as at June 2005.\n\nFirst Raymond James Report, p. 32.\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal has therefore decided that the most reliable way to estimate the 2005 market value of the hotel is to go back to the \"agreed\" 1999 market value of USD10.57 million and to adjust it to a June 2005 value by reference to an objective measure of increased value. The Tribunal considers that there can be no real doubt that in June 2005 the hotel was worth at least an amount corresponding to the 1999 \"agreed\" value of USD10.57 million as that sum had increased in line with the rate at which risk-free investments denominated in the same currency would have increased in value.\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimant itself has made such a computation, by recalculating the 1999 \"agreed\" sum of USD10.57 million using the \"risk-free\" rate of Interest on US Treasury Bills.149 It calculated estimated values of USD13.79 million at the end of 2004 and USD14.38 million at the end of 2005. Assuming a steady growth in value during the year 2005, the value of the hotel at the end of June 2005 (an adequate approximation for the value as at June 24, 2005) would have been approximately USD14.08 million. That represents an increase in the value of the hotel of a little over 30% during the period May 1, 1999 - June 30, 2005. The Tribunal is satisfied that the hotel was worth not less than USD14.08 million In June 2005. It adopts that figure as the basis for Its further calculations.\n\nSecond Raymond James Report, p. 5.\n\nThe Payments Due Under the 1999 Share Purchase Agreement\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nIn order to acquire the whole of the interest in the hotel the Claimant would have been obliged to fulfil its obligations under the July 1999 Share Purchase Agreement (as amended in 2003) to pay the liquidator of Ak-Keme. According to Article 3.4 of the Share Purchase Agreement, only upon fulfilment of the obligations under that Agreement (which included the obligation to pay USD12.7 million for the shares: Article 2) was the buyer, Sistem, entitled to transfer the purchased share capital of Hotel Ak-Keme De Luks \"wholly or partially to third persons.\"\n\n177.\n\nThose sums were initially due not to the Respondent but to the liquidator; but the three-sided agreements in 1999, between Ak-Keme (through its liquidator), Sistem, and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic,, restructured the debts. In any event, it is evident that Sistem's true loss must take account of its obligation to pay for the acquisition of Ak-Keme's 50% interest in the hotel in accordance with the 1999 Agreements, and evident also that it is the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic that must pay compensation because it is the Kyrgyz Republic that has been found to have caused the injury to the Claimant as a result of the breach of the obligations of the Kyrgyz Republic under the BIT.\n\n178.\n\nIt is necessary that the repayment obligation be evaluated as a single sum, estimated as at June 27, 2005. The sum ought, in principle, to be that which Sistem would have had to pay to the liquidator or the Kyrgyz Government in order to obtain release from its obligations to make a full and prompt set of payments by instalments in accordance with the December 2003 schedule of payments.\n\n179.\n\nThat sum would in principle be no more than the total of any amounts already due in accordance with the schedule of payments from the Claimant to the Respondent on June 27, 2005, plus an amount which, if invested by the Claimant at reasonable commercial rates on June 27, 2005, would have been expected to generate a sum corresponding to each of the payment instalments on the dates on which that instalment fell due. Since practically all of the payments were due in US dollars, the rates should be those applicable to transactions in US dollars.\n\n180.\n\nThe first Raymond James Report offers one estimate (as of December 2007), of USD3,632,659.150 The Tribunal considers, however, that the Claimant has not demonstrated that the 14% interest rate applied there to discount the value of the future sums payable by Sistem is appropriate - particularly in the light of recent trends in interest rates - or that such a rate is in line with the calculations that an investor would have made in June 2005.\n\nFirst Raymond James Report, p. 45.\n\n181.\n\nFurthermore, it cannot be assumed that the entire sum would in fact have been payable by Sistem. Article 6 of the 1999 Loan Transfer Agreement stipulated that\n\n\"[i]n case the Republic of Turkey immunizes the Republic of Kyrgyz from the guarantor obligations to be fulfilled regarding the provided credits [sc., the Eximbank loan], the Government of the Republic of Kyrgyz shall immunize 'Sistem Muhendislik Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S' Firm from the payment of the credit transfer fee amounting to 8,700,000 (eight million seven hundred thousand) USD.\"151\n\nThis appears to mean that if Turkey waives its right to repayment of the loan by the Kyrgyz Republic, the Kyrgyz Government would waive its right to repayment by Sistem. Sistem might, therefore, have ended up paying as little as USD2.2 million, if the payments in respect of the full USD8.7 million credit were waived.\n\nCM 14.\n\n182.\n\nIn these circumstances it is particularly difficult to determine what a realistic discounted value for the scheduled payments would have been, which the Liquidator or the Kyrgyz Government might have accepted in return for releasing Sistem from its payment obligations. The Prayer for Relief in the Claimant's Memorial asks the Tribunal to award compensation in the range of USD19.57 million \u2014 USD21.27 million \"or such sum as the Tribunal may decide is reasonable and properly due to the Claimant in respect of the asset value of the Hotel.\"152 The Tribunal considers that this authorizes a robust approach to the question of the valuation of Sistem's debt under the 1999 Agreement - principally,153 the USD10,985,799 payable as the dollar-denominated component.\n\nCl. Memorial, para. 305.1.\n\nSistem had in fact paid only 17,428,517.57 Soms of the 19,571,000 Soms payable under the 2003 schedule. The difference - equivalent to around USD50,000 - is within the margin of error in the approach that the Tribunal has adopted.\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a reasonable approximation can be obtained by asking what sum would have generated the USD10,985,799 payable by Sistem at the end of the 18 year period starting in November 2005 within which the dollar amounts were repayable under the 2003 payment schedule.154 That simple approach would, hypothetically, give the Kyrgyz Government less than the payment schedule, because it does not take account of the value of having part-payments of the sum due at six-monthly intervals during the repayment period. On the other hand, it would, hypothetically, give the Kyrgyz Government more than they would have been paid if the Turkish Government had waived repayment rights at some stage before the final payment was due.155\n\nUnder that schedule only the Som - denominated debt was repayable in the first two years of the 20 year schedule.\n\nThere Is no Indication In the Share Purchase Agreement that the Kyrgyz Government would repay any sums to Sistem If Turkey waived Its right to repayment after Sistem had, In effect, paid off the whole or part of the debt in respect of the Eximbank Ioan. The Tribunal accordingly disregards that possibility.\n\n184.\n\nThe key question is, what discount rate should be applied? Attempts to identify rates that might actually have been used in the calculation of the price of buying out Sistem's scheduled payment obligations founder on the fact that interest rates available to a private enterprise such as Sistem are not the same as those available to a sovereign State such as the Kyrgyz Republic. Borrowing rates are higher for private enterprises. The applicable rate would therefore depend upon whether one looks at the cost to Sistem of funding the payment stream or the cost to the Government of borrowing a similar sum. For example, on June 27, 2005 the LIBOR USD rate was 3.83%.156 Commercial rates were, of course, higher. On the other hand the Kyrgyz Republic had in March 2005 succeeded in rescheduling its Paris Club debt on concessional terms.\n\n*See, e.g.,* http://www.bba.org.uk/bba/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=141&a=11945.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that for the purposes of discounting the value of the scheduled payments back to June 2005 levels, in the absence of evidence clearly indicating that another standard should be used, it is reasonable to use the LIBOR USD rate. This is an objective standard. It has been used by the Claimant;157 and it is used in Article 6(3) of the Kyrgyz Investment Law as the standard for interest payable in cases of expropriation.\n\n*E.g.,* Cl. Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, p. 10.\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal has therefore arrived at a June 2005 value of the sums due from the Claimant to the Kyrgyz Government under the schedule of payments of USD5.58 million, a sum which would, over 18 years of compound interest at 3.83%, have yielded USD10.98 million.\n\n187.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that the value of the hotel in June 2005 was USD14.08 million minus USD5.58 million, which equals USD8.5 million. That sum will, of course, be augmented by the interest due upon it, as is explained below.\n\nThe Claim For Lost Profits\n--------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Claimant seeks an award in respect of lost profits from March 2005 onwards.158 The Tribunal accepts that the function of financial reparation is to wipe out, as far as possible, all of the losses caused to the Claimant by the Respondent's breach of its legal duties owed to the Claimant. In broad terms, the successful Claimant is to be put in the same financial position as he would have been in if his rights had not been violated. Account must be taken of the fact that the Claimant lost not only the hotel, but also the profits which the hotel would have generated if the Claimant had retained ownership and possession of it. It is, however, important not to double-count that element of the Claimant's loss.\n\nCl. Memorial, para. 305.2.\n\n189.\n\nIn the present case, compensation for the loss of the hotel takes the form of the award of a lump sum payment. The calculation of that lump sum starts by awarding an amount equivalent to the value of the hotel *at the time of the expropriation* (i.e., June 27, 2005). The hypothetical willing buyer's expectations regarding future profits and losses would, of course, have a significant influence upon the price that would have been paid, and thus upon the value of the hotel at that date. Indeed, as one study has observed, \"where the fair market value is established by using the DCF method, it directly represents the net present value of future (in relation to the date of valuation) cash flows that the investment is expected to generate.\"159 Actual profits and losses, which might vary greatly from those anticipated at the time of the loss or hypothetical \"willing buyer - willing seller\" sale, would have been unknown and could have had no influence.\n\nSergei Ripinsky with Kevin Williams, Damages in International Investment Law, p. 289 (British Institute of International & Comparative Law, 2008).\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal's valuation of the hotel as at the time of the taking in 2005 was an extrapolation from a DCF valuation of the hotel as of 1999.160 Accordingly, the DCF element in the valuation has already taken some account of the profits that the hotel was expected to generate. It is, however, not enough to award the Claimant the sum which the Tribunal has determined the hotel was worth in June 2005. Had the hotel not been taken, the Claimant would have generated profits from the hotel. Had the Claimant sold it to a willing buyer, at a price reflecting the buyer's expectations of the hotel's profits, the Claimant would have received a cash sum in June 2005 which the Claimant could then have invested, earning interest on the cash sum. The interest is, in a sense, therefore the counterpart of the profits which the Claimant would have continued to earn from its investment in the hotel. It follows that the Claimant is entitled not only to a sum equivalent to the value of the hotel but also to interest on that sum, from the date of the taking up to the date on which the compensation is paid. In this way the profits lost by the Claimant will be compensated. But the Claimant could not both have retained the hotel and also held the lump sum and invested it as an income-producing asset: if it had retained the hotel it would not have had the lump sum, and *vice versa.* That is why the Claimant cannot also recover lost profits for the period after the taking. If there were to be an award of lost profits as well as an award of interest, the Claimant would in effect be compensated twice for the same loss.\n\n*See supra* paras. 165-175.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered whether compensation for lost profits might be due for the period between March 25, 2005 and June 27, 2005, on the basis of a failure by the Respondent to protect the investment in accordance with its obligations under the BIT, assuming that such an obligation existed.161 There is, however, evidence that during the early part of that period the Kyrgyz Republic was attempting to restore the hotel to Sistem, so that there is no clear evidence to support a date prior to 27 June 2005 on which the Respondent's liability for breach of the BIT might be said to have begun. Furthermore, this was a short period which saw much political turmoil; and any estimate of the profits (if any) of the hotel during this period would be speculative. In these circumstances, the Tribunal has decided not to make any award in respect of lost profits.\n\nAs to which, *see infra* para. 197.\n\nThe Claim For Interest\n----------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimant has also claimed interest on the monetary award.162\n\nCl. Memorial, para. 305.3.\n\n193.\n\nThe Tribunal has estimated the amount that would have represented the market value of the hotel if it had been paid to the Claimant on June 27, 2005. As has been noted, the Claimant is entitled to interest on that sum, from the date of the taking up to the date on which the compensation is paid. The Claimant is thus entitled to interest on the sum of USD8.5 million, from June 27, 2005 up to the date on which the sum awarded is paid.\n\n194.\n\nThe proper role of the payment of interest is to fulfil the duty to compensate the Claimant for the whole of its loss. One cannot know what a Claimant would have done had it been paid USD8.5 million in June 2005. It might have made spectacularly good, or disastrously bad decisions on the investment of such a sum. The cautious approach is to assume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that its loss would have been at least that of the principal sum plus interest gained from risk-free investments. It is plain that had that sum been invested it would have generated compound interest, and full compensation of the Claimant's loss therefore demands that the award of interest be similarly compounded.\n\n195.\n\nUnlike the estimate of the market value of the hotel on June 27, 2005, the calculation of the interest payable can properly take account of facts that have occurred since June 27, 2005. In particular, it can be calculated having regard to the actual interest rates that have obtained during this period.\n\n196.\n\nOn that basis the Tribunal determines that the interest payable is that resulting from the LIBOR USD twelve-month rate. Interest is payable from the date of the taking (June 27, 2005) up to the date of the payment of the sums owing under this award.\n\nClaims Under Other Headings in the BIT\n--------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that the Respondent was in breach of its BIT obligations concerning expropriation. The Claimant also argued that although the Kyrgyz-Turkey BIT does not itself set out obligations of Fair and Equitable Treatment and Full Protection and Security in its operative paragraphs, such obligations were owed by the Respondent to the Claimant by virtue of the MFN provision in Article II of the Kyrgyz-Turkey BIT. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to decide this point, or the question whether there was a breach of the Article 11 duty to accord \"national\" treatment to investors, because the sum awarded by the Tribunal represents the full loss which the Tribunal has determined was suffered by the Claimant. Nor has the Tribunal found it necessary to consider the precise position under Kyrgyz investment law, because any losses sustained as a result of any such breach arising from the facts in this case would already be fully compensated by the award that the Tribunal has made in respect of the BIT breaches.\n\n198.\n\nAccordingly, the sum awarded by the Tribunal represents the full loss which was suffered by the Claimant, and no further sums are due under the claims in this case.\n\n199.\n\nThe Claimant also sought additional relief, in the form of an order that the Kyrgyz Republic must not make any other decisions in relation to the hotel, and that any payment awarded or to be awarded by the Kyrgyz courts against Sistem or its shareholders \"will be added in favour of Sistem and will not be off-set.\" The Tribunal considers that it is unable to make an order in such wide terms, and it declines to do so.\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent has referred to various sums said to be owing by the Claimant to the Kyrgyz Republic. These sums were not made the subject of a counter-claim in these proceedings; nor were there any detailed pleadings addressed to them. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to rule upon those claims. Those claims are not affected in any way by the present award, and the Respondent may pursue them through other procedures if it so wishes.\n\nThe Claim For Costs\n-------------------\n\n201.\n\nBoth parties submitted summary accounts of the costs that they had incurred in conducting the case and sought an order to recover them from the other Party. The Claimant's costs amounted to just over USD686,392, plus advance payments to ICSID of approximately USD429,000. The Respondent's costs amounted to just over USD230,000. The Tribunal is required by Article 58 of the Additional Facility Rules to determine how and by whom the costs of the arbitration shall be borne.\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the reasonable costs of a successful Claimant incurred in pursuing a successful claim for compensation are, in principle, a part of the loss suffered as a result of the violation of the Claimant's rights, and accordingly recoverable from the Respondent.\n\n203.\n\nIt also accepts that in some cases disputes arise not from obvious breaches of legal obligations but from different conceptions, held in good faith, of the legal position. In such cases the costs of the resolution of the dispute through agreed procedures might be regarded as an extension of the costs incurred by each Party in making the initial agreement. Indeed, in some circumstances the parties may choose to leave to an arbitral tribunal the determination of their precise rights and duties, rather than themselves continue negotiations and increasingly detailed drafting of agreements. In such cases it seems more appropriate to regard the costs of arbitration as a cost of establishing the initial relationship between them, which in the absence of indications to the contrary is to be shared equally between them.\n\n204.\n\nIn many, perhaps most, cases it will not be possible to place the case at one or other of these extreme positions. In such circumstances the Tribunal must exercise its discretion and arrive at an apportionment of costs which it considers to be fair in the light of all the circumstances that gave rise to the dispute and in the light also of the manner in which the parties conducted the arbitral proceedings.\n\n205.\n\nThere are no settled principles concerning the apportionment of costs in ICSID proceedings and ICSID Additional Facility Proceedings. Studies have suggested that the most common solution is for ICSID fees and the costs of the Tribunal to be shared equally and for each Party to bear its own legal costs.163 In some cases, however, the \"loser pays\" principle has been applied.164\n\n*See, e.g.,* Christoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2001), p. 1229. *Cf.* Campbell McLachlan QC, Laurence Shore, Matthew Weiniger, Loukas Mistelis, International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles, pp. 346-349 (Oxford 2007)..\n\nMcLachlan QC, *supra* note 163, pp. 346-349.\n\n206.\n\nIn the present case the Tribunal notes that the Respondent did not appear in the first procedural meeting and that the Respondent unsuccessfully challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in 2007. The Tribunal notes also that the opacity of the Claimant's financial arrangements contributed to the difficulty of determining the amount of its loss, and may also have been a factor contributing towards the development of the dispute. Once proceedings were under way, neither Party obstructed the progress of the proceedings.\n\n207.\n\nIn these circumstances the Tribunal considers it fair that the parties should each pay an equal share of the ICSID fees and the costs of the Tribunal, and that the Respondent should make a contribution to the legal fees incurred by the Claimant. The Tribunal has therefore decided:\n\ni. that the Respondent should pay to the Claimant the sum of USD400,000 as a contribution towards the Claimant's legal fees. Interest is payable on that amount from the date that the payment is due: i.e., the date of this award.\n\nii. that the Respondent should reimburse the Claimant USD247,410 representing half of USD494,820, which is the total advance payments that the Claimant has paid to ICSID for the fees and expenses of the Centre and the costs of the Tribunal;\n\n**ORDER**\n---------\n\n208.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal hereby orders:\n\ni. That the Respondent shall pay the Claimant the sum of USD8.5 million, plus interest on that sum at the LIBOR USD twelve-month rate for the period from the date of the taking (June 27, 2005) up to the date of the payment of the sums owing under this award.\n\nii. That the Respondent shall pay to the Claimant the sum of USD400,000 as a contribution towards the Claimant's legal fees, plus interest on that sum at the LIBOR USD twelve-month rate for the period from the date of this award up to the date of the payment.\n\niii. That the Respondent shall reimburse the Claimant USD247,410 representing half of USD494,820, which is the total advance payments that the Claimant has paid to ICSID for the fees and expenses of the Centre and the costs of the Tribunal.\n\niv. That all other claims are hereby dismissed."}]}
