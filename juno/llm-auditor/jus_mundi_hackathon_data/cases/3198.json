Christopher Thomas\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**Introduction**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nI concur generally with the Award, but on the key jurisdictional question of whether the Respondent adopted or maintained measures \"*relating to*\" the Claimant's covered investment, I found this to be a difficult question that did not yield an easy answer and I have reservations about the approach taken in the Award. In the end, I arrived at the same result, but for different reasons. I also wish to comment on the Minimum Standard of Treatment. Accordingly, I append this separate opinion.\n\n2.\n\nIt would be remiss of me not to record at the outset that my colleagues have been unfailingly courteous and willing to engage in extensive discussion of the issues raised in this important case. I wish to express my gratitude to the President for his admirably clear drafting and his management of the arbitration and the deliberations, as well as my regard for Mr. Garibaldi's constructive efforts in bringing this case to a conclusion.\n\n3.\n\nArticle 1101 of the Treaty is entitled \"Scope and Coverage.\" It specifies that measures \"adopted and maintained\" by a Party \"relating to\" certain subjects, are governed by the substantive obligations set forth in the Chapter's Section A, \"Investment,\" and can give rise to an investor-State claim under the Chapter's Section B, \"Investor-State Dispute Settlement.\"\n\n4.\n\nThis type of provision was first employed by the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\") and it has been replicated in many subsequent treaties. NAFTA tribunals have described it as the \"gateway\" through which a claimant must pass in order to seize a tribunal with jurisdiction to hear a claimed breach of the protections specified in the investment chapter.1 The meaning of the phrase \"relating to\" is thus central to a tribunal's determination of its jurisdiction.\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, Partial Award, 7 August 2022, para. 106(i) (**RLA-22**): \"This is the gateway leading to the dispute resolution provisions of Chapter 11. Hence the powers of the Tribunal can only come into legal existence if the requirements of Article 1101(1) are met \u2026.\" Cited with approval by *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/01, Award, 17 July 2006, para. 76 (**RLA-33**).\n\n5.\n\nThe Treaty contains eight Scope and Coverage provisions, worded in different ways. A review of those provisions reveals that the intention of the Treaty's drafters was to specify different forms of connection between measures and the subjects addressed in the various chapters. Reference to the Scope and Coverage clauses used in other chapters thus assists in ascertaining the meaning of the clause used in Chapter Eleven.\n\n6.\n\nIt is important to the proper operation of Chapter Eleven that its Scope and Coverage provision not be interpreted in a way that relaxes the \"relating to\" requirement, because that would result in an unjustified broadening of the jurisdictional gateway. This is not the Tribunal's intention, but I think it right to comment on this issue.\n\n**The gravamen of the case**\n----------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe National Pension Service (\"NPS\") was established to administer the assets of the Republic of Korea's National Pension Fund (\"NPF\"). Procedures were prescribed by law to protect the independence of NPS decision-making from outside interference and to further certain specified goals intended to protect the NPF's interests and the interests of Korean pension subscribers and pensioners.2\n\nAs the Award notes, in reference to the Voting Guidelines applicable to the NPS when administering the NPF's assets: \"The Voting Guidelines further require that the voting rights of the Fund be 'exercised in good faith for the benefit of the subscribers, former subscribers and public pension holders.'\" Award, para. 156.\n\n8.\n\nThe present claim arose out of (i) acts taken by State organs external to the NPS; and (ii) acts of the NPS itself in deciding how to cast a vote on the proposed Merger between SC&T and Cheil Industries. The Korean courts found that there was an unlawful interference in procedures erected to ensure the independence of NPS decision-making as well as breaches of the relevant officials' duties of loyalty and of care as fiduciaries of the assets of the NPF.3\n\nAs the Award notes, at para. 160: \"According to the Fund Operational Regulations, the employees must act, *inter alia*, in accordance with fiduciary duties as prudent fiduciaries of the Fund, and always perform their duties with honesty and fairness.\" And at para. 161: \"The Enforcement Rules of the Fund Operational Regulations establish that NPSIM officers and employees are to manage and operate the Fund 'in accordance with the management and operation principles of the Fund,' through, *inter alia*, 'secur[ing] the transparency of the Fund and the efficiency of investments in order to earn the confidence of the public.'\"\n\n9.\n\nThis interference did not stem from errors of judgement. As a result of the then-President's direction that the Merger should be approved, undue pressure was mounted on the Minister of Health and Welfare by the President's Executive Office, and in turn upon the Chief Investment Officer of the NPS. They in turn pressed other officials to build a justification for the Merger or, in the case of the Investment Committee, to approve it. The Korean courts also found that shortly after the Merger was approved, at a one-on-one meeting, the then-President drew Mr. JY Lee's attention to the role that her Administration had played in supporting his succession plan through the NPS's vote in favour of the Merger and intimated that some pecuniary recognition of that assistance was in order. Mr. Lee took the hint and payment was made. Both individuals were subsequently convicted for the offence of bribery and terms of imprisonment were imposed.4\n\nThe President was also convicted of abuse of power and coercion.\n\n10.\n\nAt the time of the hearing in this case, a second prosecution of Mr. Lee is afoot; in that proceeding, the prosecutor alleged that an unlawful *quid pro quo* preceded the NPS's vote on the Merger. The courts evidently have not yet decided the point.\n\n**The key jurisdictional objection**\n------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe question for this Tribunal was whether the acts found to be unlawful at municipal law also sounded a claim for breach of either or both of the substantive obligations invoked by the Claimant.\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the claim based on an alleged breach of Article 11.3, National Treatment, was barred by the Respondent's Equity Interests Reservation taken under Annex 2. This left one claim, the alleged breach of the Minimum Standard of Treatment, to be considered. For the Tribunal to be able to consider the merits of that claim, it was necessary that the Claimant first satisfy the Treaty's jurisdictional requirements.\n\n13.\n\nAmong other defences, the Respondent asserted that the Tribunal lacked the requisite jurisdiction to hear the claim because the Claimant could not show that the Republic of Korea \"*adopted or maintained measures relating to*\" (in the case of an alleged breach of Article 11.5(1)) the Claimant's \"covered investment.\"5 Various arguments were advanced as to the meaning and application of this phrase, all of which were rejected.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 228-36; Rejoinder, paras. 32-34; Respondent's PHB, paras. 17-21; Respondent's Reply PHB, paras. 10-11.\n\n14.\n\nI agree with the Tribunal's interpretations of the terms \"measures\" and \"adopted or maintained.\" In my view, the only significant jurisdictional question presented by the claim was whether the Respondent adopted or maintained measures \"relating to\" the Claimant's covered investment. The Respondent's arguments on this point went to the heart of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear the case and, as shall be seen, there was a serious question whether the measures did relate to the Claimant's covered investment in the sense of Article 11.1(1).\n\n15.\n\nAn unusual feature of this dispute was that it centred on the exercise of voting rights attached to shares. Shares are a species of property, and it is an inherent feature of the right of ownership that a person can dispose of its shares in a company as it sees fit. In so doing, it generally owes no duty to any other owner of shares in the company.\n\n16.\n\nPutting to one side the statutory requirements applicable to the NPS in the present case, in general it is open to a shareholder to vote its shares in favour of a merger even if, objectively speaking, it is economically unreasonable to do so. It is also not uncommon for shareholders of a company to disagree as to whether a proposed transaction is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. This is why proxy battles arise in the first place. Thus, in the ordinary course there would be no basis for one investor in a company to complain about how another investor exercised its vote.6 This was not an ordinary case, but the general point remains valid.\n\nThe Claimant accepted this. It accepted that in launching the proxy battle, it was prepared to lose it if conducted fairly. \"Knowing that Samsung might propose an economically irrational merger for its own purposes is one thing\u2014while not expecting this, the Claimant was prepared for any fair proxy contest that ensued. Knowing that, under President Park's corrupt direction, the Blue House, Ministry and NPS would engage in illegal acts to make that merger a reality\u2014notwithstanding the costs to the NPS and Korea's state pension holders\u2014is another thing entirely.\" Reply, para. 451.\n\n17.\n\nInsofar as the specific issue of treaty interpretation is concerned, the important fact was that the voting rights attached to shares owned by the NPF. Under Korean law, the decision on whether to vote for or against the Merger was vested in the NPS, which is charged with administering the NPF's assets.\n\n18.\n\nTo foreshadow my analysis, applying the framework of Chapter Eleven of the Treaty and the Treaty more generally, it is clear that:\n\n(a) The NPF was an investor of the Republic of Korea.7\n\n(b) The measures complained of *related to* the exercise of voting rights attached to the NPF's 11.21% shareholding in SC&T.\n\n(c) The *effect* of the measures was the approval of a merger that was disadvantageous to SC&T shareholders (and, by virtue of the Merger Ratio, advantageous to Cheil shareholders).8\n\n(d) That *effect* was experienced by the Korean investor itself, and by every other person, including the Claimant, that held shares in SC&T.\n\nIn fact, the NPF is owned by the Republic. Award, para. 444: \"The function of the NPS is to manage and administer the National Pension Fund, which under Korean law belongs to the State, and not to the NPS.\"\n\nAward, para. 816, *referring to* the Seoul District Court's findings in the Moon/Hong proceedings.\n\n19.\n\nIt was, therefore, beyond any serious dispute that the impugned measures \"related to\" a Korean investor's investment.\n\n20.\n\nIn contrast to those measures, there were, on the facts of the present case, instances where the Republic of Korea did adopt or maintain measures plainly relating to the Claimant's covered investment.\n\n21.\n\nThe following does not purport to be an exhaustive list of those measures, but it suffices to make the point:\n\n\u2022 The Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act was such a measure. Among other things it prescribed the rules governing a merger, including the means for determining the merger ratio, and the share appraisal mechanism available to a dissenting shareholder after a merger has been approved.\n\nThis law is a \"measure\" as understood by Article 1.4 of the Treaty and it related to the Claimant's covered investment.9 It is an example of a law of general application enacted well before the events in question arose, and thus without any knowledge on the part of the State that at some future date a U.S. investor in the form of the Claimant would oppose a merger governed by the law.10\n\nIf claimed to violate one or more of Chapter Eleven's substantive obligations, the law would be a measure allegedly in breach, and in respect of which the Claimant could assert that it had incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n\u2022 On 9 June 2015, the Claimant applied to the Korean courts to enjoin the holding of the Extraordinary General Meeting of SC&T or alternatively, if the EGM were to be held, to prevent it from passing resolutions regarding the proposed Merger.11\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court rejected the application. The Claimant appealed to the Seoul High Court and from there to the Supreme Court. The appeal to the latter was ultimately withdrawn on 23 March 2016.12 The courts' consideration and disposition of the Claimant's application were measures relating to its covered investment.\n\n\u2022 On 11 June 2015, the Claimant applied to the Seoul Central District Court to block the intended sale of treasury shares on the basis that the sale had been strategically timed and was intended to cause \"severe distortion of voting right[s] at the EGM.\"13 On 7 July 2015, the Seoul Central District Court rejected the application (and on 10 July 2018 that finding was upheld on appeal).14\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court's treatment of the Claimant's application can be said to have related to the Claimant's covered investment.15\n\n\u2022 After the Merger was approved, on 27 August 2015, the Claimant initiated court proceedings to invoke the share appraisal remedy for the buy-back of shares purchased before the Merger's announcement.16\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court refused to re-appraise the price. According to the Claimant, the court found \"itself constrained by the statutory formula set out in the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act \u2026.\"17\n\nAn appeal was taken to the Seoul High Court (although the Claimant withdrew its appeal on 23 March 2016 after concluding its Settlement Agreement with SC&T).18 On 30 May 2016, the High Court reversed the Seoul Central District Court's decision and determined that the buy-back price should be recalculated to KRW 66,602 per share. The parties (other than the Claimant) appealed further to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the decision on 14 April 2022.19\n\nThe statutory formula applicable for determining the appraisal price was a measure relating to the Claimant's covered investment, as was the decision of the Seoul Central District Court applying that formula.\n\nFinancial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act, 1 July 2015, Art. 165-5(3) (**C-213**).\n\nI make this point because this issue is a matter of some importance to the Tribunal (*see* Award, para. 359). The Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act assists in making my point that the approach which I take is not a \"backdoor\" introduction of what the majority considers to be an unwarranted \"*immediacy*\" requirement. I believe that there *is* such a requirement, but my interpretation of \"relating to\" fully encompasses measures taken by States that could relate to an investor or its investment sometime in the future. It is therefore not necessary to introduce an effects test into Article 11.1(1).\n\nElliott Application for Preliminary Injunction for Prohibition on Notifying of and Passing Resolutions, etc. at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders, 9 June 2015, pp. 33-35 (**C-195**); Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2015KaHap80582, 1 July 2015, p. 9 (**R-9**).\n\nStatement of Defence, Annex A: Table of Korean Court Proceedings.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 55.\n\n*Id.*\n\nElliott Application for Preliminary Injunction for Prohibition on the Sale of Treasury Shares, 11 June 2015, p. 7 (**C-198**); First Smith Statement, para. 39(iv) (**CWS-1**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2015BiHap91 (Consolidated), 27 January 2016 (**C-259**).\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 258.\n\nStatement of Defence, Annex A: Table of Korean Court Proceedings.\n\nSupreme Court Case No. 2016Ma5394 (Consolidated), 14 April 2022, pp. 1, 11 (**C-782**).\n\n22.\n\nHad the Korean courts acted inconsistently with Article 11.5 of the Treaty by, for example, denying a fair hearing in any of the proceedings listed above such as to amount to a denial of justice, such measures plainly would have related to the Claimant's covered investment and hence have fallen within the Tribunal's jurisdiction to consider an alleged breach of Article 11.5.\n\n23.\n\nBut the Claimant did not seek to impugn the conduct of the Korean courts in any of the proceedings to which it was a party, nor did it challenge any law or regulation adopted or maintained by the Republic of Korea. Instead, as already noted, the measures complained of all related to an investment of a Korean investor and it was the *effect* of such measures that was said to have caused loss or damage to the Claimant's covered investment.20\n\nAt various places in its pleadings, the Claimant noted that the measures complained of produced an effect on its covered investment. For example, in its Reply, at para. 294, the Claimant asserted: \"\u2026 in this case, both the Claimant and its investment in SC&T could be expected to be affected by the ROK's ensuring that the NPS would vote 'yes' on the Merger.\" And in its PHB, at para. 58, the Claimant acknowledged that it was true that \"the ROK's measures affected other SC&T shareholders\" (emphasis added), but went on to assert that the measures were conceived with the Claimant in mind. (I will discuss the latter assertion later in this opinion because it is an important one.)\n\n24.\n\nThe question therefore was whether and how measures adopted or maintained relating to the National Pension Fund's investment could also, or in addition, or through that medium, be found to \"relate to\" the Claimant's covered investment. An affirmative answer to this question was a prerequisite to the Tribunal being able to exercise jurisdiction over the claim.\n\n**The Governing Law**\n---------------------\n\n25.\n\nArticle 11.22 of the Treaty, Governing Law, provides that a tribunal is to \"decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.\" Thus, although the Tribunal's subject-matter jurisdiction is restricted to determining a breach of any of the substantive provisions listed in Section A of Chapter Eleven, it must have regard to the Agreement as a whole when deciding a dispute.\n\n26.\n\nAs a result, it is both necessary and appropriate to consider how the Treaty describes the forms of connection between \"measures\" and the subject-matters of various chapters.\n\n**The Scope and Coverage issue**\n--------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nParagraph (1) of Article 11.1 of the Treaty states as follows:\n\n**Article 11.1: Scope and Coverage**\n\n1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) investors of the other Party;\n\n(b) covered investments; and\n\n(c) with respect to Articles 11.8 and 11.10, all investments in the territory of the Party.\n\n**The meaning of \"*****relating to*****\"**\n------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nBefore setting out my approach, it is helpful to quote from the Award's analysis of Article 11.1(1) and to add my comments to the quoted passages as a means of identifying the interpretative differences between us:\n\n\u2022 Proximate Context: The term \"measures\" has a broad meaning, and therefore the phrase \"relating to\" should be given a \"sufficiently broad\" meaning. That is, the Tribunal says:\n\n\u2026 the proximate context of this expression includes the term \"measure,\" which is to be interpreted broadly, as determined above. The context therefore indicates that the terms \"relating to\" must denote a relationship that is sufficiently broad to accommodate the broad meaning of the term \"measure.\"21\n\nIn my view, the broad meaning given to the term \"measure\" (with which I agree) does not bear on the meaning to be given to \"relating to.\" A Treaty-wide illustrative definition of \"measure\" cannot change the meaning of the chapter-specific expressions of connection. They are two separate matters.\n\nSince the term \"measure\" is used throughout the Treaty, it is in \"proximate context\" with other forms of connection, such as the term \"*may, directly or indirectly affect*,\" the term employed in another chapter. Thus, the breadth of the term \"measure\" says nothing about the breadth or narrowness of \"affecting,\" \"relating to,\" or any other verb used in the Treaty's Scope and Coverage clauses.\n\nI would add that focusing on the \"proximate context\" of \"measure\" and \"relating to\" only in Chapter Eleven unduly narrows the interpretative analysis. In my view, it is appropriate to consider not only the context of the terms in close proximity in Chapter Eleven, but also across the Treaty as a whole.22\n\n\u2022 Object and purpose: I agree with the Tribunal that the term \"relating to\" must be interpreted \"in light of\" the object and purpose of the Treaty. The Tribunal asserts:\n\nIn contrast with investment contracts, investment treaties \u2013 including the Treaty \u2013 are generally meant to apply to a class of anonymous or undetermined investors \u2013 any investment that falls within the scope of application of an investment treaty *ratione temporis*, *ratione personae*, and *ratione materiae* is generally protected under the treaty. There is therefore no requirement of \"privity\" or \"immediacy\" between the host State and the protected investor, and accordingly it is not necessary for the host State even to be aware of a foreign investor having invested in the territory of the host State, or of its investment, for such investment to be protected under the treaty in question. Indeed, foreign investment is often based exclusively on transactions between private parties and hence may not directly involve the host State at all. This does not mean, however, that such investments are not protected under the applicable investment treaty.23\n\nI agree with the general thrust of the foregoing quotation, but in my view it goes too far. It is true that at the time of the entry into force of an investment protection treaty, the States party to the treaty cannot know what disputes will arise. No one can predict the future and certainly no one can predict who will step forward to submit a claim to arbitration. Thus, in principle, any investment that falls within the scope of application of an investment treaty *ratione temporis*, *ratione personae*, and *ratione materiae* is generally protected under the treaty.\n\nHowever, I do not agree with the implication that \"[t]here is no requirement of 'privity' or 'immediacy' between the host State and the protected investor\" *at the point that a dispute arises under Chapter Eleven*.\n\nIn fact, all experience shows that when a dispute arises under an investment treaty, even if in many cases there is no \"privity,\"24 there is an \"immediacy\" between the host State's measure(s) and the investor that claims rights under the treaty.\n\nThe State may be alleged to have enacted a law that dispossesses the investor or its investment of trademark rights, it may be alleged to have wrongly denied a permit needed to exploit a natural resource or to carry on a regulated business, it may be alleged to have wrongly withdrawn previously granted subsidies, its courts might be alleged to have denied justice in a particular litigation, and so on.\n\nIn all of these instances, there *is* a close connection between the State's measures and the claimant, an \"immediacy,\" to use the Award's phrasing. The \"relating to\" gateway to Chapter Eleven jurisdiction is precisely the means of determining such immediacy.\n\nThis has been recognized by several NAFTA tribunals applying the same language as that found in Article 11.1. I will discuss the *Methanex* case in some detail later in this opinion, but I note for present purposes the following sample of tribunal holdings.\n\nIn *Cargill Inc. v. United Mexican States*,25 while the tribunal questioned without deciding whether the *Methanex* test of a \"legally significant connection\" might be too strict, it held that a restrictive import permit requirement on high fructose corn syrup imposed in retaliation against restrictive U.S. sugar trade policies had \"an immediate and direct effect on the business of the Cargill de Mexico [the U.S. claimant's subsidiary] but also constituted a legal impediment to the carrying on the business of Cargill de Mexico\" with the result that the threshold gateway in NAFTA Article 1101(1) was there met by the claimant investor.26 (Emphasis added.)\n\nIn *Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America*, the tribunal held that: \"[t]he immediate effect of the Import Alert made it impossible for Apotex-US legally to receive contracted products from Apotex Inc.'s two facilities at Etobicoke and Signet; and, as a direct result, Apotex-US was prevented from carrying on that major part of its business of sourcing those products from Apotex Inc.'s two facilities for re-sale in the USA.\"27 (Emphasis added.)\n\nIn the *Bilcon* case, the tribunal held: \"\u2026 Bilcon had a significant legal connection with the proposed 3.9 [hectare] quarry\u2014and with the larger quarry and terminal project\u2014as a result of its partnership agreement with Nova Stone. At this point Bilcon qualified as an investor for the purposes of Chapter Eleven of NAFTA. Bilcon had standing to raise challenges under Chapter Eleven in respect to government measures addressing matters such as industrial permits sought by Nova Stone, transfers of such permits to the partnership, approvals sought by Nova Stone, and applications by Nova Stone or the partnership for environmental licenses.\"28 (Emphasis added.)\n\nAll of these measures plainly related to the partnership in which the claimant held an interest in the sense that without the permits and approvals, the project could not proceed.\n\nIt need hardly be added that in cases where, for example, it is claimed that the claimant has suffered a denial of justice, there is by definition an immediacy between the courts' conduct of a litigation and the claimant and/or its investment.\n\n\u2022 Ordinary meaning: The Tribunal states:\n\nIn the present case, the Treaty makes clear that its scope of application, insofar as it relates to \"Investment,\" is limited to \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party *relating to*: (a) investors of the other Party; [and] (b) covered investments.29\n\nThis statement is correct so far as it goes, but the interpretation of Article 11.1(1) should encompass the whole of the paragraph. If examined fully, the interpreter can derive additional guidance as to the meaning of \"relating to.\" Similarly, the formulations of other Scope and Coverage provisions in the Treaty also inform the interpretation. I discuss this further below.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal then returns to the \"privity\" and \"immediacy\" point once again:\n\n\u2026 the terms \"relating to\" in the Treaty must have a meaning that, on the one hand, is broad enough to denote a relationship between a measure and a class of anonymous or undetermined investors or covered investments but, on the other hand, is narrower than denoting a relationship based merely on an *ex post* determination of an adverse effect on an investor or a covered investment. At the same time, the search for such a narrower or \"legally significant\" meaning cannot be used as a backdoor to create a requirement of \"privity\" or \"immediacy\" between the investor and the host State.30\n\nI already noted that the \"relating to\" test is the means of determining such immediacy in the event of a dispute and will elaborate further upon this below. For present purposes, I note that the *Methanex* case, to which the Tribunal then refers (\"Such a relation between a measure and an investor or a covered investment can also be said to be 'legally significant,' as argued by the Parties by reference to the *Methanex* award\"31) confirms the point that I am seeking to make.\n\n\u2022 In the end, the Tribunal decides that:\n\n\u2026 a measure \"relates to\" an investor or an investment under the Treaty if it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the measure in question was adopted or maintained that it may adversely affect an investor of the other Party or a covered investment, as the case may be.32\n\nAs shall be seen, I believe that the \"may adversely affect\" test is barely different than the \"affects\" and \"may, directly or indirectly, affect\" tests employed in other Scope and Coverage provisions.\n\nAward, para. 357.\n\nI observe that both Parties to the dispute made reference to other chapters in support of their interpretations of various terms. See Award, paras. 315 and 337, for examples of the Parties doing so. The Tribunal itself does so too when analyzing the meaning of the term \"measure.\" Award, para. 351.\n\nAward, para. 358.\n\nIn fact, there *must* be privity for some disputes arising under Chapter Eleven of the Treaty. One of the bases for claim under Section B of Chapter Eleven is an alleged breach of an \"investment agreement\" as defined in Article 11.28, Definitions. *See* Article 11.16: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration, paragraph (1)(a)(i)(C) (\"the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim \u2026 that the respondent has breached \u2026 an investment agreement.\"). *See also* subparagraph (b)(i)(C). Privity is thus required in such cases.\n\nIn the interests of full disclosure, I wish to disclose that I was a member of Mexico's team of counsel in *Cargill, Incorporated v. United Mexican States*.\n\n*Cargill, Incorporated v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009, para. 175 (**CLA-2**).\n\n*Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Award, 25 August 2014, para. 6.23 (**CLA-1**).\n\n*William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton, and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v.

When determining the meaning of Article 11.1(1), I believe it is appropriate to examine all of the relevant provisions of Chapter Eleven which collectively form the context of the chapter of which Article 11.1 forms a part, and to consider the formulation of the Chapter's Scope and Coverage provision, having regard to the context of the Treaty as a whole.\n\nAward, paras. 357-59.\n\n31.\n\nApplying Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, there are three sources of guidance to the interpreter, both literal and contextual: (i) Article 11.1 itself; (ii) the substantive obligations of Chapter Eleven; and (iii) the Scope and Coverage provisions of other chapters of the Treaty. I will discuss each in turn.\n\n**A. Article 11.1**\n-------------------\n\n32.\n\nStarting with Article 11.1, as noted above, paragraph (1) of the Article states that Chapter Eleven applies to \"measures adopted or maintained relating to\" three classes of subjects:34\n\n(i) \"investors of the other Party\";\n\n(ii) \"covered investments\" (which, according to Article 1.4 of the Treaty, are investments in the territory of a Party \"of an investor of the other Party\");35 and\n\n(iii) \"\u2026 all investments in the territory of the Party.\"\n\nAs discussed below, the class(es) of subjects will vary, depending upon which substantive obligations are alleged to have been breached.\n\nTreaty, Article 1.4 (**C-1**): \"**covered investment** means, with respect to a Party, an investment, as defined in Article 11.28 (Definitions), in its territory of an investor of the other Party that is in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter.\" (Bolding in original.)\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal has focused on the first two of the classes of subjects, but the third class is also relevant to a full understanding of Chapter Eleven's scope and application.36\n\nTreaty, Article 11.1(1)(a)-(c) (**C-1**). The Tribunal confines its analysis to subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of Article 11.1(1). Award, para. 359: \"In the present case, the Treaty makes clear that its scope of application, insofar as it relates to 'Investment,' is limited to 'measures adopted or maintained by a Party *relating to*: (a) investors of the other Party; [and] (b) covered investments.'\" In my view, subparagraph (iii) also provides important context.\n\n34.\n\nArticle 11.1(1) makes clear that the Parties to the Treaty differentiated between \"investors of the other Party\" and their \"covered investments,\" and between three classes of investments: (i) \"covered investments\" of investors of the other Party (in this case, the United States); (ii) investments of investors of the respondent Party (in this case, the Republic of Korea); and (iii) investments of investors of third States not party to the Treaty.37 The distinguishing characteristic of the three types of investments is whether they are owned or controlled by an investor which is connected to one or the other Party, or to a State that is not a party to the Treaty.\n\nI employ this example simply because the Tribunal is concerned with a claim against the ROK by a U.S. investor; the hypothetical could of course be reversed as between the Parties to the Treaty.\n\n35.\n\nThe reason for this differentiation between \"investor\" and \"investment\" and between \"investments\" is that Chapter Eleven's substantive provisions are variously worded in terms of how and when they apply to the different subjects listed in Article 11.1(1).38\n\nThe Tribunal accepts this differentiation at footnote 472.\n\n36.\n\nThis leads to the second source of interpretative guidance.\n\n**B. The substantive obligations listed in Section A**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nSection A of Chapter Eleven sets out the obligations which can form the basis for an investor-State claim under the Treaty.39 Some of the obligations listed in Section A apply to a covered investment, but not to an investor of the other Party, some apply to both, and two obligations apply to all investments in the territory of a Party.40\n\n*See* Treaty, Article 11.16, Submission of a Claim to Arbitration (**C-1**).\n\nTreaty, Articles 11.8 and 11.10 (**C-1**).\n\n38.\n\nTo illustrate the point, Article 11.3, National Treatment, applies to \"investors of the other Party\" (in paragraph 1) and to \"covered investments\" of investors of the other Party (in paragraph 2).41\n\nArticle 11.4, Most-Favored-Nation Treatment, does the same in its paragraphs (1) and (2).\n\n39.\n\nBy contrast, the relevant provisions of Article 11.5, Minimum Standard of Treatment, those at issue in the instant case, paragraphs (1) to (3), do *not* apply to \"investors of the other Party.\" Rather, they apply only to measures relating to \"covered investments\" of investors of the other Party. Paragraphs (4) to (6) of Article 11.5, on the other hand, apply to both investors of the other Party and their covered investments or to investors of the other Party only.42\n\nParagraph (4) applies to both: \"Notwithstanding Article 11.12.5(b), each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party, and to covered investments, non-discriminatory treatment with respect to measures it adopts or maintains relating to losses suffered by investments in its territory owing to war or other armed conflict, or revolt, insurrection, riot, or other civil strife.\" Paragraph (5) applies only to \"investors of the other Party\" for the \"requisitioning of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities; or for the destruction of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter's forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation \u2026.\"\n\n40.\n\nAnd in the case of an alleged breach of the \"Performance Requirements\" obligation, a U.S. claimant could complain of measures relating to \"an investment in its [*i.e.* Korea's] territory of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party\" (that is, (i) a U.S. claimant's own investment; (ii) an investment of a Korean investor; or even (iii) an investment of an investor of a third State not a party to the Treaty).\n\n41.\n\nThe different formulations of the substantive articles assume importance because they show that the drafters of the Treaty broadened or narrowed, as they saw fit, *the range of contestable measures as well as the subjects to which measures apply*.\n\n42.\n\nThis is most clearly illustrated by contrasting Articles 11.5(1) and 11.8. In accordance with Article 11.1(1), a breach of Article 11.8 could be alleged by a U.S. claimant in respect of measures adopted or maintained relating to an investment of a Korean investor that were alleged to have caused loss or damage to the claimant.\n\n43.\n\nBut this formulation of the range of contestable measures was not employed in Article 11.5(1). That paragraph of the article restricts a claimant to complaining about measures relating to its own covered investment that are alleged to have caused loss or damage by reason of a breach.\n\n44.\n\nThe fact that Article 11.8 expressly allows a U.S. claimant to make a claim in respect of measures adopted or maintained relating to an investment of a Korean investor that were alleged to have caused loss or damage to the claimant, but Article 11.5 does not expressly do so, raises a serious question of interpretation: by virtue of the different wording of the clauses and the Chapter's differentiation between investors and investments, and between investments, is it possible for the Claimant in this case to assert that measures relating to the exercise of voting rights attached to shares owned by a Korean investor relate to it?\n\n**C. The Treaty's Scope and Coverage provisions**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe third source of interpretative guidance as to the meaning of Article 11.1(1) comes from the way in which the States party to the Treaty framed the Treaty's various Scope and Coverage provisions.43\n\nAward, para. 359: \"The ordinary meaning of the terms 'relating to,' in this context, is narrower than that of other similar terms; for instance, the Treaty does not say in Chapter Eleven, as it does in some other chapters, that it applies to any investor or investment 'affected' by the measures adopted or maintained by a Party.\"\n\n46.\n\nAs noted above, there are eight Scope and Coverage provisions in the Treaty. Some are identical (allowing for differences of wording stemming from the chapters' subject-matters) and others are quite different in terms of describing the type of connection between \"measures\" and the subject(s) to which they apply.\n\n47.\n\nFor example, Article 9.2, the Scope and Coverage provision for Chapter Nine, Technical Barriers to Trade, applies to standards and other like measures \"that *may, directly or indirectly, affect* trade in goods between the Parties \u2026.\" This gives the chapter a very wide scope and coverage for technical barriers.\n\n48.\n\nA somewhat less expansive, but still broad Scope and Coverage provision is found in Chapter Twelve, Cross-Border Trade in Services. It applies to measures \"*affecting* cross-border trade in services \u2026.\"44\n\nSo too does the equivalent provision in Chapter Fourteen, Telecommunications, in the context of trade in telecommunications services.\n\n49.\n\nBy contrast, the relevant subsection of Article 11.1(1) speaks of \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party *relating to* \u2026 covered investments.\"45\n\nThis form of connection is also found in the Agriculture chapter, and in the Financial Services chapter.\n\n50.\n\nWe are agreed that \"relating to\" connotes a narrower form of connection than \"affecting.\"46 \"Relating to\" implies a closer type of connection between the measures and the subject than measures \"affecting\" the subject, and a much closer type of connection than measures \"that may, directly or indirectly, affect\" the subject. The latter phrasing is very broad indeed because it is worded in the conditional (\"*may*\") and it reaches not only measures that may directly affect the subject, but also measures that may indirectly affect it.\n\nAward, para. 359: \"The ordinary meaning of the terms 'relating to,' in this context, is narrower than that of other similar terms; for instance, the Treaty does not say \u2026 that it applies to any investor or investment 'affected' by the measures adopted or maintained by a Party. The 'relating to' clause therefore cannot be interpreted so broadly as to cover any adverse impact on an investor or an investment, even if such impact was not reasonably foreseeable by the host State at the time when it adopted or maintained the measure.\"\n\n51.\n\nIn sum, according to the framework employed by the Treaty' drafters, *affecting* something is not the same as *relating to* something. In my opinion, the overall structure and phrasing employed in Chapter Eleven, and in the Treaty more generally, points to the conclusion that measures relating to one shareholder's investment do not simultaneously relate to another shareholder's investment by reason of their effects on that investment.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the \"relating to\" requirement cannot be satisfied by the mere effect of a measure taken in relation to one investor's investment on another person's investment. It adds that a measure will relate to a subject (an investor or a covered investment, as the case may be) \"if it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the measure in question was adopted or maintained that it may adversely affect an investor of the other Party or a covered investment, as the case may be.\"47 (Emphasis added.)\n\nAward, para. 359.\n\n53.\n\nIn my opinion, this is barely different from the formulations employed in other Scope and Coverage provisions (\"*affects*\" and \"*may, directly or indirectly, affect*\") but not in Article 11.1(1), and for that reason and the others previously discussed, I have reservations about that approach.\n\n54.\n\nTaken collectively (i) the wording and context of Article 11.1, combined with (ii) Chapter Eleven's differentiation of subjects and its express contemplation in Article 11.8 that a claimant can complain of measures relating to another investment that cause damage to the claimant's investment \u2013 but that formulation is not used in Article 11.5(1); and (iii) Chapter Eleven's non-use of terms such as measures \"affecting\" or \"may, directly or indirectly, affect\" when describing the requisite connection between measures and a subject, the \"relating to\" requirement requires a closer form of connection between the measures sought to be impugned and a claimant than the \"*may adversely affect*\" test contemplates.48\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, I do not accept the Claimant's contention that the phrase \"relating to\" in Article 11.1 of the Treaty is merely designed to ensure that some factual nexus exists between the measures taken by the State and the impairment of the investor's rights. Reply, para. 288; Claimant's PHB, para. 54.\n\n**The basis for passing though the jurisdictional gateway in the present case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nOn reflection, I have concluded that there is one way in which the measures that were adopted or maintained by the Republic of Korea relating to the NPF's investment in SC&T shares could be said to relate to the Claimant's covered investment.\n\n56.\n\nI previously adverted to the bribery convictions of the then-President and Mr. Lee. This was no ordinary case. The evidence is that prior to the Merger's announcement, when there was market speculation of a possible merger between SC&T and Cheil, the Claimant's Mr. Smith and a colleague attended a meeting with the NPS. Mr. Smith testified, and his testimony was not rebutted by any witness testimony on the point, that the NPS representatives agreed with him that a merger on the basis of the two companies' then-current share prices would be detrimental to SC&T shareholders.49\n\nFirst Smith Statement, para. 28 (**CWS-1**).\n\n57.\n\nThe proposed Merger was announced by the boards of the two companies on 26 May 2015. There is no record evidence of any intention on the part of the Respondent to intervene in the NPS's decision-making until the Claimant announced on 4 June 2015 that it had amassed a 7.12% stake in SC&T and that it intended to oppose the Merger. The evidence is that it was only after that public announcement that the President mobilized to support Mr. Lee's succession plan by instigating the interference in the NPS's consideration of the Merger vote.50 This was the finding of the Seoul High Court:\n\nThe meeting was held immediately after the Merger which was considered as one of the most crucial succession processes when issues such as stricter separation of industrial and financial capital and promotion of economic democratization policies were increasingly brought up for discussion with the status of [Geon-hui Lee]. In order to accelerate the succession to consolidate his control of the group under the succession-friendly [Park] Administration that assisted the Merger, it was necessary for [JY Lee] to show his gratitude to the Defendant with regard to the Merger and ask for continued assistance in connection with the succession.\n\nAround the one-to-one talks on 25 July 2015, the Defendant thought that she could give assistance to [JY Lee's] succession, and her thought was shared by the presidential staff in the Blue House. [The Samsung Group] faced a situation where the success of the Merger hinged on a showdown vote at the general shareholders' meeting with the unexpected emergence of the [Claimant] in the course of the Merger and went all out to seal the Merger in a group-wide effort. By having the Ministry of Health and Welfare unduly intervene in the process of the NPS' exercise of its voting rights, the Defendant and her presidential staff in the Blue House had caused the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger at the general shareholders meeting of [SC&T], which had a decisive influence on sealing the Merger.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the office of [BH] prepared a talking points memo dated July 25, 2015 to provide the Defendant with reference materials to the Defendant for her one-on-one meeting with [JY Lee]. \u2026 [T]he talking points memo contained the following in connection with the succession: \"The corporate governance of the [Samsung Group] is vulnerable to threats from foreign hedge funds, etc. A crisis of [the Samsung Group] is the crisis of the Republic of Korea, so I hope [the Samsung Group's] corporate governance becomes quickly stabilized so that the group can be committed to future affairs in the face of fierce international competition.\"\n\n...\n\nThere was decisive assistance from the [Park] Administration to the Merger immediately prior to the meeting, and such friendly stance of [the Park] Administration was sustained afterwards.51\n\nThe Claimant alleged that on or around 29 June 2015, President Park instructed Blue House officials to \"take good care of the NPS voting rights issue regarding the [Cheil] and [SC&T] merger,\" which those attending the meeting understood to mean ensuring that the Merger was approved. Reply, para. 432(a), *referring to* Second Suspect Examination Report of Jin-su Kim to the Special Prosecutor, 9 January 2017, pp. 5-6 (**C-488**); Fourth Suspect Examination Report of Hyeong-pyo Moon to the Special Prosecutor, 5 January 2017, p. 9 (**C-482**).\n\nSeoul High Court No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018, pp. 101-03 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\n58.\n\nIt was thus the \"unexpected emergence\" of the Claimant's publicly stated opposition to the Merger that galvanized the Administration into providing \"decisive assistance\" to the Merger (in aid of Mr. Lee's succession plan).\n\n59.\n\nAs already noted, the Korean courts, including the Supreme Court, held that the unlawful interference in the NPS vote was tainted by corruption. It may or may not be the case that a *quid pro quo* was agreed before the NPS voted in favour of the Merger. The point, though interesting, is not decisive because there was a judicial finding that the bribe was solicited within days of the Merger's consummation:52\n\nDuring the one-on-one talks of July 25, 2015, the Defendant demanded sponsorship for a certain organization while asking to \"provide monetary support to an organization founded by medalists from the winter Olympics.\"\n\n...\n\nSponsorship for the AA Center was provided between October of 2015 and March of 2016 when the individual issues that form part of the succession plan were proceeding, including the winding of circular-shareholding, the strengthening of defense of management right against foreign capital, and the conversion of [AV] into a financial holding company pursuant to the merger in the present case.\n\n...\n\nWith respect to the sponsorship for the [AA] center, the presence of unjust solicitation that requested for assistance in [JY Lee's] succession plan is found.53\n\nThe Merger was approved on 17 July 2015 and became effective on 14 September 2015.\n\nSeoul High Court No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018, pp. 105, 107, 130 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\n60.\n\nIn this regard, the present case bears some important parallels to *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*.54 In that case, the claimant, a producer of methanol, contended that two measures taken by the state of California to ban the use of a gasoline additive (\"MTBE\"), of which the claimant's product was the principal ingredient, related to it *even though neither measure was expressly directed at or mentioned methanol, methanol producers or the claimant itself*.\n\nMethanex Corporation advanced claims of breach of National Treatment, the Minimum Standard of Treatment and Expropriation.\n\n61.\n\nThe United States objected to the tribunal's jurisdiction to hear the case. Among the arguments advanced, the U.S. asserted that the measure complained of did not \"relate to\" the claimant or to its investment. This is precisely the same issue as is presented in the instant case.\n\n62.\n\nIt was common ground that there were \"measures\" (a California Executive Order and certain California Regulations) and that the claimant was an \"investor of another Party\" for the purposes of NAFTA's Scope and Coverage provision. The issue was whether measures relating to other persons or products somehow related to Methanex.\n\n63.\n\nAfter it held a jurisdictional hearing, the tribunal stated that it was inclined to hold that the measures complained of did *not* relate to the claimant:\n\n154. On the sole basis of these assumed facts and inferences, it is doubtful that the essential requirement of Article 1101(1) is met. It could be said with force that the intent behind the measures would be, at its highest, to harm foreign MTBE producers with no specific intent to harm suppliers of goods and services to such MTBE producers. If so, the measures would *not* relate to methanol suppliers such as Methanex; and accordingly, even with such intent as alleged by Methanex, we would have no jurisdiction to decide Methanex's amended claim.55 (Emphasis added.)\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para. 154 (**RLA-22**).\n\n64.\n\nHowever, the claimant had amended its statement of claim and the essence of the new allegation was described by the tribunal as follows: \"In short, it is contended, as regards Governor Davis, that his constituency was the State of California; a 'foreign' product was a product foreign to California, which to him, as influenced by ADM [Archer Daniels Midland Company, a major ethanol producer whose product competed with the claimant's methanol56], signified methanol produced by Methanex, a 'foreign' product produced by 'foreigners'; and his intent was to harm Methanex.\"57\n\nThe claimant alleged that ADM had a secret meeting with Governor Davis during his election campaign; this meeting concerned ethanol; ADM made substantial campaign contributions to Governor Davis, and after he was elected he paid back the favour by banning MTBE. *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para. 153 (**RLA-22**).\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para. 157 (**RLA-22**).\n\n65.\n\nThe United States accepted with regard to Article 1101 (the NAFTA equivalent to Article 11.1(1) of the Treaty) that: \"If the purpose of the measure is an intent to harm foreign-owned investors or investments on the basis of nationality, then the measure relates to the foreign-owned investor or investment.\"58\n\nMethanex Corporation v. United States of America, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para. 152 (**RLA-22**).\n\n66.\n\nThe tribunal found that it was unable to decide the contention on the evidence then before it and permitted the claimant to file a fresh pleading.59 In the end, after a further evidentiary hearing, the tribunal found that the claimant could not sustain its claim that the governor adopted or maintained the measures with the intention to harm it and therefore the measures complained of did not \"relate to\" Methanex.60\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, Part II, Chapter E, para. 6 (**RLA-28**): \"In the Partial Award, the Tribunal decided that the case presented by Methanex was not sufficiently clear to enable the Tribunal to determine whether or not Methanex's allegations based on 'intent' were credible, and therefore whether or not one of the US measures could 'relate to' Methanex or its investments for the jurisdictional purposes of Article 1101(1) NAFTA. Accordingly the Tribunal invited Methanex to re-plead its case in a fresh pleading and postponed its decision on the USA's jurisdictional objection with respect to Article 1101(1) NAFTA.\"\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, Part IV, Chapter E, para. 22 (**RLA-28**): \"Having concluded on the evidential record that no illicit pretext underlay California's conduct and that Methanex has failed to establish that the US measures were intended to harm foreign methanol producers (including Methanex) or benefit domestic ethanol producers (including ADM), it follows on the facts of this case that there is no legally significant connection between the US measures, Methanex and its investments. As such, the US measures do not 'relate to' Methanex or its investments as required by Article 1101(1). Accordingly, the USA succeeds on its jurisdictional challenge under Article 1101, as regards Methanex's claim pleaded in its Second Amended Statement of Claim; and the Tribunal concludes that it lacks jurisdiction to determine Methanex's substantive claims alleged under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1105 and 1110.\"\n\n67.\n\nIn a passage that contrasts sharply with the facts of the present case, the tribunal found that the claimant had been unable to make out its case that at a \"secret meeting\" between the governor and ADM an exchange of favours had been agreed:\n\n37. The Disputing Parties agreed, as did Mr Vind, that if the encounter [at the alleged \"secret meeting\" between the governor and ADM] became one of a promise to do something in return for a contribution - a \"quid pro quo\" - it would be unlawful. Moreover, the Tribunal concludes that *if* there were proof that the banning of MTBE in California reformulated gasoline, its replacement by ethanol and the impact of all of this on Methanex were extensively discussed at the dinner, *then* (ignoring the narrow restrictions on the Governor imposed by California Senate Bill 521), the timing of the dinner and the contribution of campaign funds could suggest a deal, or a quid pro quo, which would be unlawful and, also, satisfy in this case the intent requirement for Article 1101, as well as for Articles 1102, 1105 and 1110 NAFTA.\n\n38. However, the Tribunal again notes that Methanex concedes that it cannot offer such proof: \"[W]e cannot prove \u2026 anything criminal. We can't prove any quid pro quo. We can't prove any handshake deal\". Thus, the question the Tribunal turns to is whether the evidence adduced can even support, by way of inference, Methanex's view of the dinner - that is, whether there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to justify inferring that the exchange at the dinner was unlawful.61 (Emphasis added.)\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, Part III, Chapter B, paras. 37- 38 (**RLA-28**). (Footnotes references omitted.)\n\n68.\n\nIn the end, the tribunal concluded that the evidence adduced by the claimant did not support the finding of an unlawful *quid pro quo* and the claim was dismissed on the ground that the measures complained of did not relate to the claimant or its investment.62\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, Part III, Chapter B, paras. 37- 38 (**RLA-28**). (Footnotes references omitted.)\n\n69.\n\nOn this key issue, the facts of the present case are entirely different. There was a meeting shortly after the Merger was consummated, the then-President adverted to the support that her Administration had given to Mr. Lee's succession plan (thus explicitly drawing a connection between her Administration's interference in the NPS's operating procedures and the benefit conferred on Mr. Lee), and then intimated the appropriateness of his providing some pecuniary compensation for the favour bestowed.\n\n70.\n\nIn other words, unlike the evidence before the *Methanex* tribunal which led that tribunal to find that the measures relating to MTBE did not relate to Methanex because (i) the measures at issue were not expressly directed at methanol, methanol producers or the claimant itself; and (ii) that claimant could not adduce evidence of malign intent, in the case before this Tribunal, the Claimant has, through the proof of the convictions of the former President and Mr. Lee, been able to demonstrate that the Korean courts found that after the Merger, the then-President's support for the Merger was rewarded by undue benefits.63\n\nAward, para. 620.\n\n71.\n\nAccordingly, measures that related to the voting of the NPF's shares in favour of the Merger, which would otherwise not satisfy the \"relating to\" requirement set forth in Article 11.1, can be said to have related to the Claimant. The weight of the evidence shows that had it not been for the unexpected emergence of the Claimant's highly publicized proxy campaign, the measures relating to the voting of the NPF's shares would likely not have been adopted or maintained in the first place. The measures, intended by the President to assist the succession plan by means of a vote in favour of the Merger, necessarily were intended to defeat the Claimant's proxy battle, in respect of which it had acquired its 7.12% shareholding in SC&T. Whether the President intended to harm the Claimant's covered investment is not clear. But what is clear is that upon the giving of her directive, unbeknownst to the Claimant, it was engaging in a waste of time and money in launching a proxy battle that was destined to fail, and at least to that extent it was harmed. That interference, tainted by corruption, suffices to allow the Claimant to pass through the jurisdictional gateway of Article 11.1.\n\n72.\n\nNo two cases are ever the same, but the key point to be derived from *Methanex* was that measures adopted or maintained relating to some other subject could be found to relate to a claimant and/or its investment if there was a corrupt intent to advance the interests of a party through the measures ultimately adopted. That is what would have created the \"legally significant connection\" had Methanex been able to make out its jurisdictional case. In the present case, the Claimant has been able to make that case.\n\n73.\n\nOn the highly unusual facts of this case, I therefore concur in the result reached by the Tribunal, albeit for different reasons.\n\n**The Minimum Standard of Treatment**\n-------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nFinally, I wish to comment on the Minimum Standard of Treatment (\"MST\"). I agree with the Tribunal's description of the approach required by the Treaty when it comes to establishing a rule of customary international law. I note that the disputing parties agreed that the *Waste Management II* award authoritatively described the MST.64 It should be noted however that being a NAFTA tribunal, the *Waste Management II* tribunal was not expressly bound to apply the kind of mandatory methodology set forth in Annex 11-A of the Treaty and was in fact seeking to express an \"emerging\" general \"standard of review\" based upon its review of certain prior NAFTA cases.65 Prior judicial and arbitral decisions can assist in discerning the existence of a customary international law rule, but caution should be exercised to ensure that the court or tribunal, as the case may be, sought to ascertain State practice and *opinio juris* prior to declaring itself on the existence of an alleged rule.\n\nIn the interests of full disclosure, I wish to disclose that I was a member of Mexico's team of counsel in *Waste Management II*.\n\n*See* *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States (II)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, para. 98 (**CLA-16**).\n\n75.\n\nI note in addition that the United States asserted in its Submission before this Tribunal that currently \"customary international law has crystallized to establish a minimum standard of treatment in only a few areas.\"66 (Emphasis added.) Examples of such rules are then set out at paragraph 19 of the U.S.\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 18. \"One such area, expressly addressed in Article 11.5.2(a), concerns the obligation to provide 'fair and equitable treatment,' which includes 'the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world.'\" To this the United States adds a handful of other crystallized customary international rules in para. 19: \"To the extent that the customary international law minimum standard of treatment incorporated in Article 11.5 prohibits discrimination, it does so only in the context of other established customary international law rules, such as prohibitions against discriminatory takings, access to judicial remedies or treatment by the courts, or the obligation of States to provide full protection and security and to compensate aliens and nationals on an equal basis in times of violence, insurrection, conflict or strife.\" (Footnote references omitted.)"}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**Glossary of Defined Terms**\n-----------------------------\n\n|

(the \"**Claimant**\" or \"**EALP**\"), a limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America (\"**United States**\" or \"**U.S.**\"), with its registered office at 1209 Orange Street Wilmington, DE 10901.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in this arbitration by:\n\nMr. Constantine Partasides KC  \nMr. YiKang Zhang  \nThree Crowns LLP  \n 8-10 New Fetter Lane  \nLondon EC4A 1AZ  \nUnited Kingdom\n\nDr. Georgios Petrochilos KC  \nThree Crowns LLP  \n 104 avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es  \n 75008 Paris  \nFrance\n\nMs. Elizabeth Snodgrass  \nMr. Simon Consedine  \nMs. Nicola Peart  \nMs. Julia Sherman  \nThree Crowns LLP  \nWashington Harbour  \n 3000 K Street NW Suite 101  \nWashington, DC 20007  \nUnited States of America\n\nMr. Zach Mollengarden  \nThree Crowns LLP  \n 88 Market Street  \n#40-01A CapitaSpring  \nSingapore 048948  \nSingapore\n\nMr. Beomsu Kim  \nMr Eun Nyung (Ian) Lee  \nMr. Young Suk Park  \nKL Partners  \n 17th Floor, East Wing, Signature Tower  \n 100 Cheonggyecheon-ro, Jung-gu  \nSeoul 04542  \nRepublic of Korea\n\nMr. Michael S.

Michael Bahn Kobre & Kim LLP 25 Old Broad Street London EC2N 1HQ United Kingdom\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is the Republic of Korea (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**ROK**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by:\n\nMr. Peter J.

The Subject Matter of the Dispute**\n----------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThis arbitration arises out of the Claimant's investment in Samsung C&T Corporation (\"**SC&T**\"), a publicly listed Korean company forming part of the Samsung Group.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent improperly intervened in the shareholder vote held by the National Pension Service (the \"**NPS**\") in connection with the approval of the merger of Samsng C&T (\"**SC&T**\") and Cheil Industries Inc. (\"**Cheil**\"), notwithstanding the damage that the merger (the \"**Merger**\") would allegedly cause to SC&T's shareholders, including the Claimant and the NPS itself. According to the Claimant, the Respondent's intervention, which ensured that the Merger would proceed, constitutes breaches of the minimum standard of treatment and the national treatment standard under the Free Trade Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the United States dated 30 June 2007 (the \"**Treaty**\"). The Claimant contends that the breaches caused it a substantial loss for which it seeks compensation in this arbitration.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims and that the claims are inadmissible. The Respondent further argues that the Claimant has failed to prove a breach of the Treaty, and that it is not entitled to any compensation as the alleged losses are not attributable to the Respondent, and as it has failed to show that it has suffered any loss or damage.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Commencement of the Arbitration and Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 13 April 2018, the Claimant served on the Government of Republic of Korea a Notice of Intent to submit its claims to arbitration pursuant to Article 11.16(2) of the Treaty.\n\n9.\n\nBy a Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 12 July 2018, the Claimant commenced arbitration proceedings against the Respondent pursuant to Article 11.16(3)(c) of the Treaty and Article 3(1) of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 2013 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\").\n\n10.\n\nIn its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, the Claimant appointed Mr. Oscar M. Garibaldi, a national of the United States and the Argentine Republic, as arbitrator. Mr. Garibaldi's contact details are:\n\n**Mr. Oscar M. Garibaldi**  \n 809 Wincrest Place  \nGreat Falls, Virginia 22066  \nUnited States of America  \nE-mail: ogaribaldi@garibaldiarbitrator.com\n\n11.\n\nOn 13 August 2018, the Respondent filed a Response to Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, and appointed Mr. J. Christopher Thomas KC, a national of Canada, as arbitrator. Mr. Thomas' contact details are:\n\n**Mr. J. Christopher Thomas KC**  \n 4649 Puget Drive  \nVancouver, British Columbia V6L-2V9 Canada  \nE-mail: jcthomas@thomas.ca\n\n12.\n\nOn 15 November 2018, the Parties, pursuant to Article 11.19(1) of the Treaty, appointed Dr. Veijo Heiskanen, a national of Finland, to serve as the presiding arbitrator. Dr. Heiskanen's contact details are:\n\n**Dr. Veijo Heiskanen**  \nLALIVE  \n 35, Rue de la Mairie  \nP.O. Box 6569  \n 1211 Geneva  \nSwitzerland  \nE-mail: vheiskanen@lalive.law\n\n13.\n\nOn 20 November 2018, the Tribunal notified the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\") of the Parties' agreement that the PCA be appointed to act as registry and administer the arbitral proceedings. On 21 November 2018, the PCA confirmed to the Tribunal its agreement to provide the requested services.\n\n**B. The Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 3 December 2018, the Tribunal circulated draft Terms of Appointment and a draft Procedural Order No. 1. The Tribunal invited the Parties to seek agreement on any proposed amendments to the drafts and, to the extent the Parties were unable to agree, to communicate their proposed amendments to the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nOn 17 January 2019, the Parties submitted their agreed proposed amendments to the draft Terms of Appointment and draft Procedural Order No. 1. By separate correspondence of the same date, the Parties provided comments on outstanding points of disagreement.\n\n16.\n\nOn 22 March 2019, the Tribunal held a first procedural meeting by videoconference to discuss the content of the draft Terms of Appointment and draft Procedural Order No. 1. Counsel and representatives for the Parties, the members of the Tribunal, and the PCA participated in the meeting.\n\n17.\n\nOn 27 March 2019, the Tribunal determined the sequence of the Parties' written submissions, directing that (i) the Claimant may file an amended Statement of Claim in accordance with Articles 20(4) and 22 of the UNCITRAL Rules, and (ii) following the Claimant's amended Statement of Claim, the Respondent may raise any objection in accordance with Article 11.20(6) of the Treaty and may request bifurcation of the proceedings. On the same day, the Tribunal also circulated the Terms of Appointment. The PCA distributed the Terms of Appointment signed by both Parties and each member of the Tribunal on 31 July 2020.\n\n18.\n\nOn 1 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, which *inter alia* established London as the place of arbitration, the rules of procedure, and the transparency regime applicable to the proceedings, and reserved its decision on the procedural timetable to a subsequent procedural order.\n\n**C. The Procedural Timetable and First Round of Written Submissions**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nOn 4 April 2019, the Claimant submitted its Amended Statement of Claim, together with supporting evidence.\n\n20.\n\nOn 16 April 2019, relying on ROK's Personal Information Protection Act (\"**PIPA**\"), the Respondent submitted redacted copies of the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, the Response to the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, and the Amended Statement of Claim, in accordance with paragraph 10.1 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n21.\n\nOn 26 April 2019, the Claimant contested the applicability of PIPA in this arbitration and requested that the Tribunal reject the Respondent's proposed redactions.\n\n22.\n\nOn 30 April 2019, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the production of certain documents which the Claimant allegedly failed to produce with its Amended Statement of Claim.\n\n23.\n\nOn 6 May 2019, the Claimant provided its response to the Respondent's document production request of 30 April 2019.\n\n24.\n\nOn 6 May and 16 May 2019, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Respondent and the Claimant respectively provided further comments on the Respondent's proposed redactions to the three pleadings.\n\n25.\n\nOn 14 May 2019, following a further exchange of the Parties' comments on the procedural timetable, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, setting out four alternative tracks of the procedural calendar, depending on whether the Respondent were to choose to raise any objections to jurisdiction or admissibility, the basis of such objections, and whether such objections were to be dealt with in a preliminary phase of the proceedings.\n\n26.\n\nOn 27 May 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, denying the Respondent's request of 30 April 2019 for an order for an early production of documents on the grounds that the requested documents would not be necessary for raising jurisdictional objections and that such a request would be more appropriate in the document production phase of the proceedings.\n\n27.\n\nOn 26 June 2019, having considered the Parties' respective submissions of 6 May and 16 May 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on certain issues raised by their submissions and to elaborate on their positions on some of those issues under Korean law.\n\n28.\n\nOn 22 July 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which it decided, *inter alia*, that the personal information that the Respondent requested to be redacted constituted \"protected information\" under Korean law and that the Respondent was therefore entitled to propose redactions to the Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim and to the Claimant's Amended Statement of Claim. The Tribunal determined, however, that the Respondent had waived its right to propose redactions to its Response to the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim.\n\n29.\n\nOn 22 August 2019, the Respondent, with the agreement of the Claimant, requested a four-week extension, until 27 September 2019, for the submission of its Statement of Defence, as well as a number of related amendments to the procedural timetable. The Respondent confirmed that, without prejudice to any jurisdictional or other objections it might raise in its Statement of Defence, it would not seek bifurcation of the present proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nOn 26 August 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, amending the procedural timetable as agreed by the Parties. The Tribunal also took note of the Respondent's confirmation that it would not seek bifurcation of the proceedings while reserving its right to raise jurisdictional and other objections.\n\n31.\n\nOn 27 September 2019, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence, together with supporting evidence.\n\n32.\n\nAlso on 27 September 2019, the Respondent submitted an application to delay publication of the Statement of Defence, pending the outcome of related proceedings before the Supreme Court of Korea.\n\n33.\n\nOn 10 October 2019, the Claimant responded to the Respondent's application of 27 September 2019.\n\n34.\n\nOn 11 October 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, amending the procedural timetable as agreed by the Parties, which extended the time limit for the voluntary production of documents from 6 January 2020 to 7 February 2020.\n\n35.\n\nOn 17 October and 21 October 2019, the Respondent and the Claimant respectively provided further comments on the Respondent's application of 27 September 2019.\n\n36.\n\nOn 12 November 2019, at the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent identified the passages of the Statement of Defence that in its view fell under Article 23.4 of the Treaty.\n\n37.\n\nOn 15 November 2019, the Claimant provided further comments on the Respondent's submission of 12 November 2019.\n\n38.\n\nOn 20 November 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, in which it dismissed the Respondent's application of 27 September 2019 that the Tribunal delay publication of the Statement of Defence pending the outcome of related proceedings that were pending before the Supreme Court of Korea.\n\n**D. Document Production, Amendments to the Procedural Calendar, and Non-Disputing Party Submission**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nBetween 1 November and 22 November 2019, the Parties exchanged their respective requests, objections, and replies in connection with document production.\n\n40.\n\nOn 13 December 2019, each Party submitted to the Tribunal for its decision its outstanding document production requests in respect of which the other Party maintained its objection.\n\n41.\n\nOn 6 January 2020, the United States filed a notice of intent to submit a non-disputing party submission on questions of interpretation of the Treaty on or before 7 February 2020, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n42.\n\nOn 13 January 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, setting out its decision regarding the Parties' disputed document production requests and directing each Party to prepare a privilege log that identified each responsive document that was being withheld from production on grounds of legal impediment or privilege.\n\n43.\n\nOn 17 January 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, extending the time limits for the voluntary and involuntary production of documents from 7 February 2020 to 10 February 2020 and for the submission of the Claimant's Statement of Reply from 7 June 2020 to 8 June 2020, as agreed by the Parties.\n\n44.\n\nOn 6 February 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, extending the time limit for the voluntary and involuntary production of documents from 10 February 2020 to 21 February 2020, as agreed by the Parties.\n\n45.\n\nOn 7 February 2020, the United States submitted a non-disputing party submission (the \"**U.S. Submission**\") in accordance with Article 11.20(4) of the Treaty and Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n46.\n\nOn 13 February 2020, the Respondent requested clarification and further directions from the Tribunal concerning the scope of the document production required from the Claimant.\n\n47.\n\nOn 19 February 2020, the Claimant submitted comments on the Respondent's request of 13 February 2020.\n\n48.\n\nOn 21 February 2020, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of the Parties' agreement to amend the procedural timetable. The Respondent also advised the Tribunal of its intention to address the Parties' disagreement as to whether the Claimant would be entitled to file a Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections in due course.\n\n49.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, approving the revised procedural timetable agreed by the Parties, which amended the time limits for the production of documents and the Parties' second-round written submissions. The Tribunal further took note that the revised timetable was subject to further argument by the Parties in due course as to whether a Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections would be warranted.\n\n50.\n\nOn 27 February 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12, providing clarification regarding the scope of the Parties' document production obligations.\n\n**E. Second Round of Written SubmissionS, AdditionaL Document Production Requests, and Filing of Additional Documentary Evidence**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nOn 26 May 2020, as foreseen in the Respondent's communication of 21 February 2020, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal confirm that the Claimant was not entitled to file a Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections.\n\n52.\n\nOn 30 May 2020, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal issue further orders concerning alleged shortcomings in the Claimant's document production pursuant to Procedural Order No. 8 (the \"**Respondent's Second Document Production Requests**\").\n\n53.\n\nOn 1 June 2020, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal issue further orders concerning alleged shortcomings in the Respondent's document production and that the Tribunal prioritize its request over the Respondent's application of 30 May 2020 in light of the Claimant's upcoming time limit to file its Statement of Reply (the \"**Claimant's Second Document Production Requests**\").\n\n54.\n\nOn 2 June 2020, the Claimant requested that the PCA place in escrow certain documents on behalf of both Parties. On 3 June 2020, following receipt of the Respondent's confirmation of its agreement with the Claimant's request, the PCA placed the relevant documents in escrow in accordance with the procedure agreed by the Parties.\n\n55.\n\nOn 5 June 2020, at the invitation of the Tribunal, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the Parties' agreement on a revised timetable, pursuant to which the time limits for the filing of comments on the opposing Party's Second Document Production Requests and the Parties' second-round written submissions were amended.\n\n56.\n\nOn 10 June 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, approving a revised procedural timetable as agreed between the Parties, including the amended time limits for the Parties' second-round written submissions and the procedure and time limits for the filing of comments on the opposing Party's Second Document Production Requests.\n\n57.\n\nAlso on 10 June 2020, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant's Second Document Production Requests.\n\n58.\n\nOn 12 June 2020, the Respondent submitted a further fact exhibit and produced additional documents to the Claimant, after a search request made by the Respondent following the Claimant's Second Document Production Requests.\n\n59.\n\nAlso on 12 June 2020, the Claimant copied the Tribunal on a letter to the Respondent, in which it requested the production of seven additional documents, of which the Claimant had become aware through recent media coverage (the \"**Claimant's Third Document Production Requests**\"). The Claimant also requested an extension of the time limit to file comments on the Respondent's letter of 10 June 2020 in order to review the additional documents produced by the Respondent on 12 June 2020.\n\n60.\n\nOn 15 June 2020, at the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent agreed to an extension of time as proposed by the Claimant as long as the Claimant were disallowed to add new requests to the Claimant's Second Document Production Requests. On the same date, the Tribunal confirmed the extension and similarly extended the time limit for its decision on the Claimant's Application to 24 June 2020.\n\n61.\n\nOn 17 June 2020, the Respondent copied the Tribunal in a letter to the Claimant, responding to the Claimant's Third Document Requests.\n\n62.\n\nAlso on 17 June 2020, the Claimant submitted comments on the Respondent's response to the Claimant's Second Document Production Requests.\n\n63.\n\nOn 18 June 2020, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's request of the same date to submit an additional response to the Claimant's comments of 17 June 2020 by 19 June 2020, and invited the Claimant to comment on the Respondent's additional response by 22 June 2020.\n\n64.\n\nOn 19 June 2020, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant's letter of 17 June 2020 concerning the Claimant's Second Document Production Requests.\n\n65.\n\nOn 22 June 2020, the Claimant submitted separately (i) comments on the Respondent's letter of 19 June 2020; and (ii) comments on the Respondent's letter of 17 June 2020 concerning the Claimant's Third Document Production Requests.\n\n66.\n\nOn 23 June 2020, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal not entertain the Claimant's Third Document Production Requests as addressed in the Claimant's second letter of 22 June 2020, or grant the Respondent the opportunity to respond. On the same date, the Claimant provided comments on the Respondent's letter of the same date.\n\n67.\n\nOn 24 June 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14, setting out its decisions on the Claimant's Second Document Production Requests and Third Document Production Requests. The Tribunal directed the Respondent to produce an updated privilege log identifying each responsive document that was being withheld from production on grounds of a legal impediment and to confirm that it had produced the last version of any responsive document. The Tribunal further confirmed that the Claimant may seek to establish the Respondent's failure to produce specific documents in due course and request that the Tribunal draw appropriate inference from any such failure.\n\n68.\n\nOn 26 June 2020, the Claimant submitted comments on the Respondent's request of 26 May 2020 regarding the Claimant's entitlement to file a Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections.\n\n69.\n\nOn 6 July 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15, in which it ruled that (i) the Claimant would be allowed to file a Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections as the Respondent had raised preliminary objections in its Statement of Defence; and (ii) the Claimant's Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections should be limited to responding to any new points made by the Respondent on its preliminary objections in its Statement of Rejoinder and Reply to Preliminary Objections.\n\n70.\n\nOn 7 July 2020, the Respondent submitted its updated privilege log and confirmed that it had produced the last version of any responsive document in its possession, custody or control as directed by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 14.\n\n71.\n\nOn 17 July 2020, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Reply and Defence to Preliminary Objections (the \"**Reply**\"), accompanied by supporting evidence.\n\n72.\n\nOn 24 July 2020, the Claimant submitted comments on the Respondent's Second Document Production Requests in accordance with Procedural Order No. 13.\n\n73.\n\nOn 31 July 2020, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant's letter of 24 July 2020.\n\n74.\n\nOn 6 August 2020, the Claimant provided further comments in response to the Respondent's letter of 31 July 2020.\n\n75.\n\nOn 7 August 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16, ruling on the Respondent's Second Document Production Requests and directing that the Claimant (i) confirm that it had applied the applicable legal standard with regard to the category A and B documents; (ii) disclose one document of category D; and (iii) inform the Respondent of the status of obtaining consent to disclose a document listed in category C-4. The Tribunal further clarified that such determinations were without prejudice to the Respondent's right to seek to establish in due course that the Claimant had failed to produce a specific document or documents that were in its possession, custody or control, and to request that the Tribunal draw the appropriate inferences from any such failure.\n\n76.\n\nOn 12 August 2020, the Claimant confirmed the application of the legal standard as set out by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 16 with the exception of a small number of documents in category A for which it asserted a different ground of privilege which it confirmed to have properly applied, and undertook to revert separately to the Respondent regarding the Tribunal's remaining directions.\n\n77.\n\nOn 14 August 2020, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal reconsider its decisions in relation to the category A and B documents as set forth in Procedural Order No. 16.\n\n78.\n\nAlso on 14 August 2020, the Claimant submitted an updated version of its Reply, together with a table identifying minor corrections, as well as a number of updated fact exhibits.\n\n79.\n\nOn 18 August 2020, the Claimant submitted an updated version of the second expert report of Richard Boulton KC (CER-5), together with a table identifying minor corrections.\n\n80.\n\nOn 19 August 2020, the Claimant submitted comments on the Respondent's request of 14 August 2020, requesting that the Tribunal reject the Respondent's request for reconsideration.\n\n81.\n\nOn 4 September 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 17, denying the Respondent's request of 14 August 2020 that the Tribunal reconsider certain of its decisions in Procedural Order No. 16. While the Tribunal ruled that it could not appoint a special master in the procedural setting of addressing one Party's petition for reconsideration of an earlier decision, it invited the Parties to consult with a view to making a joint proposal to the Tribunal by 18 September 2020 on the possible appointment of a special master.\n\n82.\n\nOn 14 September 2020, the Respondent noted its concerns with what it characterized as \"serious irregularities inherent in Procedural Order No. 17\" with respect to (i) the Claimant's assertions of privilege; and (ii) the suitability of appointing a special master given the differing nature of the Parties' document production objections.\n\n83.\n\nOn 17 September 2020, the Claimant provided comments on the Respondent's letter of 14 September 2020, rejecting the contention that Procedural Order No. 17 had \"serious procedural irregularities.\"\n\n84.\n\nOn 21 September 2020, the Tribunal took note of the Parties' correspondence of 14 and 17 September 2020, including that the Parties would not make a joint proposal for the appointment of a special master at that time. The Tribunal reiterated that the Parties remained free to request appointment of a special master, jointly or separately, in a different procedural setting in which the Tribunal could fulfill its duty to treat both Parties with procedural equality.\n\n85.\n\nOn 12 November 2020, the Claimant informed the Respondent that its review of the indictment of Mr. Jae-young Lee (\"**JY Lee**\"), compiled by the Financial Crimes Investigations Team of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office dated 1 September 2020 (the \"**PPO Indictment**\") and published by a Korean news service, suggested that the Respondent was in possession of documents that were responsive to the Claimant's document production requests and relevant and material to the outcome of the arbitration. Accordingly, the Claimant requested the production of these documents. The Tribunal and the PCA were copied on the letter.\n\n86.\n\nOn 13 November 2020, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Rejoinder and Reply to Preliminary Objections (the \"**Rejoinder**\"), accompanied by supporting evidence.\n\n87.\n\nOn 16 November 2020, the Respondent provided a table of errata listing minor corrections to the Rejoinder, identified since the version was submitted on 13 November 2020, as well as a fresh version of the Rejoinder reflecting the corrections.\n\n88.\n\nOn 27 November 2020, the Respondent notified the Claimant that it expected to respond to the Claimant's letter of 12 November 2020 regarding documents related to the PPO Indictment.\n\n89.\n\nOn 4 December 2020, the Respondent informed the Claimant that it considered itself under no obligation to produce the PPO Indictment as it was publicly available and had been exhibited in the Rejoinder. As to the remaining document production requests, the Respondent indicated that it would provide an update as promptly as possible and make any additional production as warranted. The Tribunal and the PCA were copied on the letter.\n\n90.\n\nOn 11 December 2020, the Claimant responded to the Respondent's letter of 4 December 2020, stating that it intended to file an application to the Tribunal for appropriate directions. The Tribunal and the PCA were copied on the letter.\n\n**F. The Statement on Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections anD Further Document Production Requests**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nOn 23 December 2020, the Claimant submitted its Statement on Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections (the \"**Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections**\"), together with supporting evidence.\n\n92.\n\nOn 19 February 2021, the Respondent sought leave from the Tribunal to add to the record an e-mail exchange between the Parties dated 30 December 2020.\n\n93.\n\nOn 24 February 2021, upon the Claimant's agreement to the Respondent's request of 19 February 2021, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's request for leave to add to the record an e-mail between the Parties dated 30 December 2020.\n\n94.\n\nOn 14 July 2021, in light of the Respondent's voluntary document production of 22 March 2021 and the ongoing proceedings related to the PPO Indictment, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal (i) draw appropriate inferences from the Respondent's alleged failure to comply with the Tribunal's document production orders; and (ii) issue orders for the production of newly identified documents (the \"**Claimant's Fourth Document Production Requests**\"). The Claimant enclosed with its application a number of exhibits, including the six documents voluntarily produced by the Respondent.\n\n95.\n\nOn 12 August 2021, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant's Fourth Document Production Requests.\n\n96.\n\nOn 27 August and 3 September 2021, the Claimant and the Respondent respectively submitted further comments on the Claimant's Fourth Document Production Requests.\n\n97.\n\nOn 20 September 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 18 concerning the Claimant's Fourth Document Production Requests, granting the Claimant's request for production of certain categories of documents insofar as the requested documents (or the content thereof) had been disclosed in court proceedings or made public by the media.\n\n98.\n\nDuring a case management conference on 13 October 2021, the Claimant requested that the Respondent (i) be ordered to produce all documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 18; and (ii) represent that all documents subject to disclosure over which it has custody and control have been produced, or specify whether it is aware of other documents that may be produced after the deadline and provide an explanation for the delayed production.\n\n99.\n\nOn 15 October 2021, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant's requests of 13 October 2021 and sought their dismissal.\n\n100.\n\nOn 28 October 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 19, ordering that the Respondent produce any further documents that it may be able to locate pursuant to Procedural Order No. 18 by 22 October 2021. The Tribunal denied the Claimant's second request of 13 October 2021.\n\n101.\n\nOn 3 November 2021, both Parties sought leave from the Tribunal to submit additional documents into the record.\n\n102.\n\nOn 5 November 2021, each Party provided its comments on the opposing Party's requests.\n\n103.\n\nOn 9 November 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 21, admitting additional documents into the record as requested by the Parties.\n\n**G. Scheduling of the Hearing**\n--------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nBetween 3 September and 14 October 2020, in view of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Tribunal consulted with the Parties in respect of the format and the possible locations of the hearing on the reserved hearing dates during the weeks of 25 January and 1 February 2021.\n\n105.\n\nOn 23 October 2020, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting by videoconference to discuss the available options for the hearing. Counsel and representatives for both Parties, the members of the Tribunal, and the PCA participated in the meeting.\n\n106.\n\nOn 26 October 2020, in light of the Parties' positions as set out in the procedural meeting, the Tribunal invited the Parties' comments regarding the following three options: (i) a hybrid hearing in Seoul on the reserved hearing dates, with possible spill-over days in the weeks of 29 March 2021 or 24 May 2021; (ii) a virtual hearing on reserved hearing dates, with an additional week in the first half of 2021 to be reserved; and (iii) an in-person hearing in the weeks of 15 and 22 November 2021.\n\n107.\n\nOn 4 November 2020, the Parties respectively expressed a preference for a hybrid hearing in Seoul on the reserved hearing dates.\n\n108.\n\nOn 7 November 2020, the Tribunal determined that the hearing would be held as a hybrid hearing in Seoul during the weeks of 25 January and 1 February 2021. It also requested that the Parties keep the weeks of 15 and 22 November 2021 in reserve, in case of unforeseen developments.\n\n109.\n\nOn 7 December 2020, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference by videoconference to discuss the organization of the hearing. Counsel and representatives for both Parties, the members of the Tribunal, and the PCA attended the meeting.\n\n110.\n\nOn 5 January 2021, following the Respondent's letters of 23 and 29 December 2020 and 5 January 2021 concerning the evolving COVID-19 situation in the ROK, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to request that the Tribunal vacate the hearing scheduled during the weeks of 25 January and 1 February 2021. Noting that the Parties would be willing to conduct the hearing sooner than the reserved dates in November 2021, the Claimant further requested that the Tribunal indicate any additional availability that might permit the hearing to take place before November 2021.\n\n111.\n\nOn 6 January 2021, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing scheduled to commence on 25 January 2021 would be postponed until further notice.\n\n112.\n\nOn 8, 25 and 27 January 2021, the Tribunal consulted the Parties in respect of possible hearing dates before November 2021 and the venue for an in-person hearing.\n\n113.\n\nOn 27 January 2021, having considered the Parties' correspondence of 25 and 27 January 2021, the Tribunal determined that the hearing be held during the weeks of 15 and 22 November 2021 in Europe.\n\n114.\n\nOn 13 August 2021 and 13 October 2021, case management conferences were held to discuss the conduct of the hearing.\n\n115.\n\nOn 1 November 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 20, based on a joint proposal of the Parties, setting out the rules governing the conduct of the hearing to be held from 15 to 26 November 2021. Annexed to Procedural Order No. 20 was the Parties' agreed indicative hearing schedule previously approved by the Tribunal on 6 October 2021.

The Tribunal also issued its Questions to the Parties to be addressed in the Parties' respective post-hearing submissions.\n\n**I. Post-Hearing Proceedings**\n-------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nOn 4 March 2022, the day on which the Parties' simultaneous post-hearing briefs were due, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had received from the Respondent, on the same day, a number of additional documents that were in the Korean language. In order to \"avoid reference to new documents in reply post-hearing briefs unless unavoidable,\" the Claimant proposed to delay the exchange of post-hearing briefs by one week to allow the Claimant to translate and properly consider the new documents.\n\n119.\n\nOn the same date, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Respondent indicated that the documents it produced to the Claimant originated from hearings in the ongoing criminal trial, and that they were produced in good faith pursuant to its continuing document production obligation pursuant to Procedural Order No. 18. The Respondent further noted that it would provide its response to the Claimant's request \"as soon as possible.\"\n\n120.\n\nPending the Tribunal's decision on the Claimant's request, the Parties filed their respective post-hearing briefs with the PCA on a without-prejudice basis.\n\n121.\n\nOn 5 March 2022, the Respondent, explaining that the documents were produced \"as soon as practicable after the very recent criminal hearings\" following a formal request to the PPO and the Korean courts to obtain them, disagreed with the Claimant that there was any basis for the Claimant's requested one-week extension. The Respondent also requested that the Tribunal order that the Respondent \"shall not be required to make further production pursuant to [Procedural Order No. 18] from hearings in the ongoing criminal trial beyond today's date.\" The Respondent further requested that the Tribunal extend the time limits of subsequent filings by one week in the event the Claimant's request was granted.\n\n122.\n\nOn 7 March 2022, the Tribunal invited the Claimant, *inter alia*, (i) to submit its request for leave to introduce the additional documents into the record by 11 March 2022; and (ii) to comment on the Respondent's correspondence of 5 March 2022. The Tribunal also indicated that the Respondent would then be invited to comment on the Claimant's request for leave by 18 March 2022 and thereafter would be given an opportunity to produce evidence in response to any new documents that were admitted. The Tribunal suspended all remaining deadlines pending its rulings.\n\n123.\n\nOn 11 March 2022, the Claimant sought leave to introduce five documents into the record as new evidence, and proposed additional procedural steps. The Claimant further submitted that the Respondent's ongoing disclosure obligations pursuant to Procedural Order No. 18 \"should naturally end on the date of that last substantive written submission from the Parties.\"\n\n124.\n\nOn 18 March 2022, the Respondent stated that it did not object to the Claimant's request to introduce the five documents into the record, even though it disagreed with the alleged relevance of the documents. The Respondent also provided comments on the Claimant's proposed procedural directions.\n\n125.\n\nOn 28 March 2022, the Tribunal *inter alia* (i) granted the Claimant's request of 11 March 2022 to admit the five documents; (ii) provided the Respondent with an opportunity to produce evidence in response to the new exhibits by 6 April 2022; and (iii) provided directions regarding the remaining post-hearing submissions. The Tribunal further suspended the Respondent's ongoing obligation to produce documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 18 pending the filing of the Parties' post-hearing briefs, but ordered that the obligation would resume as of the date of the filing of the Parties' reply post-hearing briefs until the proceedings were closed pursuant to Article 31 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n126.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's directions, the Claimant submitted the five exhibits on 30 March 2022, and the Respondent filed two new exhibits in response on 6 April 2022.\n\n127.\n\nOn 13 April 2022, the Parties filed their post-hearing briefs (respectively, the \"**Claimant's PHB**\" and the \"**Respondent's PHB**\").\n\n128.\n\nOn 18 May 2022, the Parties filed their reply post-hearing briefs (respectively, the \"**Claimant's Reply PHB**\" and the \"**Respondent's Reply PHB**\").\n\n129.\n\nOn 20 May 2022, the Respondent submitted an updated version of the Respondent's Reply PHB, with clerical corrections, to which the Claimant did not object.\n\n130.\n\nOn 1 June 2022, the Parties filed their costs submissions.\n\n131.\n\nOn 3 June 2022, referring to the amount of the Claimant's costs claim, the Respondent submitted that \"the Claimant's astronomical costs claim demands extraordinary justification\" and that each individual component of the claim \"must be scrutinized and assessed for reasonableness.\"\n\n132.\n\nOn 8 June 2022, the Claimant provided its comments on the Respondent's letter of 3 June 2022 asserting, *inter alia*, that it undertook \"a significant fact-gathering exercise, including attendance at as many of the public sessions of key criminal trials as possible \u2026, the contemporaneous records of which proved critical and necessary in justifying and obtaining the document production orders that led to the introduction of profoundly important evidence.\"\n\n133.\n\nOn 13 March 2023, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was in the process of finalizing the Award and therefore declared the proceedings closed in accordance with Article 31(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal also noted that, in accordance with paragraph 8.2 of the Terms of Appointment, the Award would be issued simultaneously in English and Korean, unless the Parties agreed that the English version may be issued first, with the Korean version to follow.\n\n134.\n\nOn 20 March 2023, the Respondent indicated its agreement with the Tribunal's intention to defer the issuance of the Award until both language versions were available, in accordance with paragraph 8.2 of the Terms of Appointment. On the same day, the Claimant indicated that it saw \"no reason why the English language version of the Tribunal's award need be delayed so as to provide a simultaneous translation into Korean.\"\n\n135.\n\nOn 21 March 2023, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, in the circumstances in which the Parties did not agree the English version of the Award be issued before the Korean version, the Award would be issued simultaneously in two language versions.\n\n**III.

The Claimant's Shareholding and Interest in SC&T and Cheil**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. SC&T***\n-------------\n\n165.\n\nElliott states that it began investing in the ROK in 2002.68 It first invested in SC&T in 2003 and continued to invest in SC&T at various times from 2010 to 2014.69\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 17; First Smith Statement, para. 11 (**CWS-1**).\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 18; First Smith Statement para. 12 (**CWS-1**).\n\n166.\n\nBetween July 2007 and November 2014, Elliott analysts assessed that SC&T shares were trading in the range of a 34.3% discount to a 25.8% premium to NAV, at an average of a 16% discount to NAV over the seven-year period.70 In November 2014, SC&T's discount sharply widened to over 30%, which Elliott analysts considered \"unexplained\" and \"unjustifiable.\"71 Consequently, from 27 November 2014, EALP and Elliott International L.P. (\"**EILP,**\" and together with EALP, the \"**Elliott Funds**\"), began to purchase total return swaps referencing SC&T shares, considering that SC&T provided \"a low risk/high reward investment opportunity.\"72\n\nSecond Smith Statement, para. 17 (**CWS-5**).\n\nReply, paras. 25(a), 29; Second Smith Statement, paras. 17, 25 (**CWS-5**). While one factor that may cause a discount in the share price of a Korean company is related to the company's shareholder base, where minority shareholders become \"wary\" that the *chaebol* in control of the company, *i.e.* the majority shareholder, would not always consider the best interests of minority shareholder interests, the Claimant explains that the analysis of SC&T did not raise these concerns. The Lee family collectively held only minority ownership in SC&T and the largest single shareholder of SC&T was the NPS. *See* First Smith Statement, para. 15 (**CWS-1**).\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 21; Reply, para. 30; First Smith Statement, para. 16 (**CWS-1**). *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 106:19 \u2013 107:2.\n\n167.\n\nEALP's interest in SC&T was held at the time in the form of total return swaps.73 According to the Claimant, EALP's inability as a holder of swaps (as opposed to a shareholder) to participate in corporate governance \"did not matter\" since it was \"only seeking to generate returns on behalf of [its] stakeholders\" and was \"not at that time seeking to exercise voting rights in respect of proposals put to shareholders.\"74\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 22.\n\nReply, para. 31, *citing* First Smith Statement, para. 19 (**CWS-1**).\n\n168.\n\nUnder Elliott's initial trading plan, the Elliott Funds were to continue to increase their investment in SC&T up to a 40% discount to the NAV, which would lead to a total investment of USD 200 million.75 Accordingly, as the discount to NAV of SC&T's shares increased steadily in December 2014 and January 2015, the Elliott Funds increased their interest in SC&T.

The Claimant's Response to the Rumors of the Merger***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nAccording to Mr. Smith, Elliott analysts assessed that it was unlikely that SC&T's shareholders would approve a merger between SC&T and Cheil because, in their view, SC&T shares were significantly undervalued, whereas Cheil shares were significantly overvalued.115 At the same time, however, aware of \"the widening discount in the trading prices of SC&T, as compared to its NAV\" and the possibility that SC&T might be involved in the restructuring of the Samsung Group, Elliott started taking \"precautionary measures\" to protect its investment in SC&T.116\n\nFirst Smith Statement, para. 22 (**CWS-1**);

First Smith Statement, para. 23(i) (**CWS-1**).\n\n187.\n\nSecond, recognizing that the NPS, as the largest single shareholder in SC&T, was in a position to influence the result of any shareholder vote on a merger proposal, the Claimant commissioned third-party consultants, including Investor Relations Counsellors (the \"**IRC**\") and Spectrum Asia, to prepare reports on the NPS, in particular its voting rules.120 According to the Claimant, the reports confirmed that the NPS could be expected to object to any merger on detrimental terms to SC&T shareholders due to its obligation to manage the Fund in accordance with the principles of profitability and independence.121\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 32;

The Announcement of the Merger Vote***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nAccording to Mr. Smith, the Claimant, considering that a merger was unlikely, prepared restructuring proposals for SC&T which it intended to raise with the Lee family.135 The Claimant states it submitted its proposals through a high-ranking officer of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, whom the Claimant understood to be personally acquainted with the Lee family.136 It is not clear whether the Claimant's proposals were ever received by the Lee family.137\n\nElliott's proposal envisaged four steps: (i) a merger between Samsung Electronics and Samsung SDS Ltd.; (ii) a de-merger of the new Samsung Electronics into a holding company and an operating company; (iii) a three-way merger between the holding company, Cheil, and Cheil; and (iv) a de-merger of the new holding company crated in the previous step into a Samsung General Holding Company and a Samsung Financial Holding Company. *See* Reply, para. 54; Second Smith Statement, paras. 52-63 (**CWS-5**).\n\nSecond Smith Statement, paras. 57-62 (**CWS-5**); Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 35:13-17.\n\n*See* Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 37:2-5.\n\n196.\n\nOn 26 May 2015, however, just when Elliott had started its efforts, the boards of SC&T and Cheil announced that they had approved the proposed Merger.138 The terms of the Merger were as follows:\n\n(a) Cheil would acquire SC&T and would in turn be renamed as New SC&T;139\n\n(b) The merger ratio would be set at 1 Cheil share for every 0.3500885 SC&T share (the \"**Merger Ratio**\");140\n\n(c) The list of shareholders entitled to vote on the proposed Merger would close on 12 June 2015;141\n\n(d) The shareholders' vote on the Merger would take place on 17 July 2015 at each company's scheduled EGM;142\n\n(e) Dissenting shareholders could exercise buy-back rights in a two-week period following the shareholders' vote;143 and\n\n(f) The Merger would close on 1 September 2015.144\n\nSecond Smith Statement, para. 57 (**CWS-5**).\n\nDART Filing titled \"Samsung C&T Corporation/Company Merger Decision\" by SC&T, 26 May 2015, p. 1 (**C-16**).\n\nDART Filing titled \"Samsung C&T Corporation/Company Merger Decision\" by SC&T, 26 May 2015, p. 1 (**C-16**).\n\nDART Filing titled \"Samsung C&T Corporation/Company Merger Decision\" by SC&T, 26 May 2015, p. 7 (**C-16**).\n\nDART Filing titled \"Samsung C&T Corporation/Company Merger Decision\" by SC&T, 26 May 2015, p. 4 (**C-16**).\n\nDART Filing titled \"Samsung C&T Corporation/Company Merger Decision\" by SC&T, 26 May 2015, pp. 5-7 (**C-16**).\n\nDART Filing titled \"Samsung C&T Corporation/Company Merger Decision\" by SC&T, 26 May 2015, p. 4 (**C-16**).\n\n197.\n\nAccording to SC&T's press release, the purpose of the Merger was to \"establish the foundation for the two companies to grow into a global leader in fashion, F&B, construction, leisure and biotech industries, to offer premium services across the full span of human life.\"145\n\nSamsung C&T Corporation, Press Release, \"Merger between Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T,\" 26 May 2015 (**C-17**).\n\n198.\n\nPursuant to the Korean Capital Markets Act, the Merger Ratio was calculated by reference to the average share price of each company over a period of up to one month prior to the announcement of the Merger.146 The application of the statutory formula led to an average price for SC&T shares of KRW 55,767 per share and an average price for Cheil shares of KRW 159,294 per share, resulting in the 1:0.35 Merger Ratio.147\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 40, *referring to* Enforcement Decree of the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act, 8 July 2015, Art. 176-5(1) (**C-222**).\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 40; Statement of Defence, paras. 76-77.\n\n199.\n\nWhile the Claimant contends that it was \"shocked\" by the unforeseen announcement of the Merger,148 the Respondent asserts, relying on a review of press reports conducted by Professor Dow, its quantum expert, that by the time of the formal announcement, the market had already widely anticipated for many months that the transaction would be proposed.149 Accordingly, in the Respondent's view, the announcement was a mere formality and one that the Claimant \"knew was coming.\"150\n\nReply, para. 58.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 75, *referring to* Expert Report of James Dow, 27 September 2019 (\"First Dow Report\"), paras. 53-54 (**RER-1**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 3; First Dow Report, para. 53 (**RER-1**).\n\n200.\n\nImmediately following the Merger announcement, the share prices of both SC&T and Cheil increased, the share price of Cheil rising by 14.98% and that of SC&T rising by 14.83% from the previous trading day.151\n\nFirst Dow Report, paras. 23-24 (**RER-1**); \"Samsung C&T share prices increase by 10%, prices likely to fluctuate,\" Maeil Economy, 4 June 2015 (**R-88**). *See* First Dow Report, p. 9, Figure 2 (**RER-1**).\n\n***4. The Claimant's Opposition to the Merger***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThere were diverse reactions in the marketplace to the proposed Merger Ratio of 1:0.35.152 At least 21 Korean securities analysts viewed the Merger positively, some speculating that the Merger could lead to an increase in sales and in share prices.153 It was reported that \"[f]or a [SC&T] investor, a number of possibilities are in the open for a long-term increase of enterprise value of the merged company, making it possible to recoup losses in terms of the rate of return on the investment\" and that it would be \"more advantageous for investors to vote yes to the Merger,\" given its potential positive effects on Samsung Electronics.154\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 82.\n\n\"How do the Domestic Securities Analysts View the 'Samsung C&T Merger'?,\" Digital Daily, 8 July 2015 (**R-11**);

(ii) its analysis of the intrinsic values of SC&T and Cheil, including independent valuations prepared by an accounting firm for each company; (iii) its recollection of the 18 March 2015 meeting at which the NPS expressed the view that a merger on the basis of then-current share prices would not be beneficial to the NPS;

Under Article 147 of the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act, an investor holding 5% or more in a security issued by a Korea Exchange-listed company must report such holdings to the Financial Services Commission and the Korea Exchange within five business days of the trade date. The Financial Supervisory Service determined that a disclosure violation may have occurred based on Elliott's report that it purchased more than 3.3 million SC&T shares in a single day on 3 June 2015.

According to the Voting Guidelines, voting rights shall be exercised in good faith to the benefit of the National Pension Scheme subscribers and pensioners193 and \"to enhance long-term shareholder value,\" \"considering environmental, social, and governance factors in order to improve the long-term and stable rate of return.\"194 The Fund shall vote against any proposal that \"lowers shareholder value or goes against the interests of the Fund\"195 and a vote should be rendered against a merger \"if it is expected that the shareholder value may be damaged.\"196\n\nFirst CK Lee Report, para. 103 (**CER-1**); Guidelines on the Exercise of the National Pension Fund Voting Rights, 28 February 2014, Art. 3 (**C-309**/**R-57**). *See also* National Pension Fund Operational Guidelines, 9 June 2015, Art. 17(2) (**C-194/R-99**).\n\nFirst CK Lee Report, para. 103 (**CER-1**); Guidelines on the Exercise of the National Pension Fund Voting Rights, 28 February 2014, Arts. 4, 4-2 (**C-309**/**R-57**). *See also* National Pension Fund Operational Guidelines, 9 June 2015, Art. 17(3) (**C-194/R-99**).\n\nGuidelines on the Exercise of the National Pension Fund Voting Rights, 28 February 2014, Art. 6(2) (**C-309**/**R-57**).\n\nGuidelines on the Exercise of the National Pension Fund Voting Rights, 28 February 2014, Annex 1, Art. 34(1) (**C-309**/**R-57**).\n\n223.\n\nUnder the Fund Operational Guidelines, the Investment Committee exercises the voting rights of equities held by the Fund following \"deliberation and resolution.\"197 In addition, the Fund Operational Guidelines provide that \"items for which it is difficult for the [Investment Committee] to determine whether to approve or disapprove are decided by the [Experts Voting Committee].\"198 Article 8(2) of the Voting Guidelines further provides that the Investment Committee may request a decision from the Experts Voting Committee when it \"finds difficult to choose between an affirmative and a negative vote.\"199\n\nGuidelines on the Exercise of the National Pension Fund Voting Rights, 28 February 2014, Annex 1, Art. 8(1) (**C-309**/**R-57**).\n\nNational Pension Fund Operational Guidelines, 9 June 2015, Art. 17(5) (**C-194/R-99**).\n\nGuidelines on the Exercise of the National Pension Fund Voting Rights, 28 February 2014, Art. 8(2) (**C- 309/R-57**).\n\n224.\n\nAt the time of the Merger, the exercise by the Experts Voting Committee of the NPS's voting rights was governed by Article 2 of the Regulations on the Operation of the Special Committee on the Exercise of Voting Rights. Article 2 reads:\n\nThe Special Committee reviews or determines items below regarding the exercise of voting rights of equities owned by the National Pension Fund and reports the results thereof to the Fund Committee.\n\n1.

(Citations omitted.)\n\n225.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether Article 2(6) of the Regulations on the Operation of the Special Committee on the Exercise of Voting Rights allows the Chair of the Experts Voting Committee to determine the items on the agenda. According to the Claimant, \"[m]atters might also be directed to the Experts Voting Committee if the Chair of that committee deemed it necessary.\"201 The Respondent argues that the Claimant's reading contradicts the NPSIM's express authority to determine its own agenda202 and broadens the scope of the Expert Voting Committee's authority beyond deciding \"difficult\" matters delegated by the NPSIM.203\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, paras. 61, 66(c), 233.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 54; Guidelines on the exercise of the National Pension Fund Voting Rights, 28 February 2014, Arts. 8(1)-(2) (**C-309**/**R-57**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 54, *citing* Regulations on the Operation of the Special Committee on the Exercise of Voting Rights, 9 June 2015, Art. 2(4) (**R-98**).

The Expected Benefits of the Merger***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the economic benefits that the NPS could reasonably have expected to result from the Merger.\n\n247.\n\nThe Parties' positions are based on the analyses of their respective experts. The Claimant's quantum expert, Mr. Boulton, takes the view that there was no reasonable economic justification for the NPS to vote for the Merger. The Respondent's quantum experts, Professors Dow and Bae, conclude that there was an economic justification because the market expected synergies to result from the Merger, pointing to the reactions of the prices of SC&T and Cheil and the falling share prices of several competitors after the Merger announcement, as well as the positions of several market analysts. They also highlight that NPS was entitled to consider the impact of the Merger on its portfolio as a whole, as well as on the Korean economy more broadly.\n\n**(a) The Claimant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nMr. Boulton seeks to quantify the net economic impact of the Merger on the NPS. Because the NPS held 11.2% of outstanding SC&T common stock but only 4.8% of outstanding Cheil common stock, Mr. Boulton submits that \"[f]or every dollar transferred from [SC&T] shareholders to Cheil shareholder, the NPS stood to make an economic loss of 6.4 cents.\"248 Relying on his calculation that between KRW 8,623,298 million and KRW 9,637,804 million were transferred from SC&T shareholders to Cheil shareholders,249 Mr. Boulton concludes that the net economic loss to the NPS from the Merger, even after accounting for its shareholding in both SC&T and Cheil, is between KRW 551,891 million and KRW 616,819 million.250 Accordingly, he opines that no \"significant operating or financial synergies could reasonably have been expected to result from the Merger.\"251\n\nSecond Expert Report of Richard Boulton KC dated 17 July 2020 (\"Second Boulton Report\"), para. 8.3.4 and Figure 23 (**CER-5**).\n\nMr. Boulton quantifies this \"transfer of value\" as part of a \"cross-check\" on his SOTP analysis in his second report. *See* Second Boulton Report, Section 7 (**CER-5**).\n\nSecond Boulton Report, para. 8.3.5 and Figure 24 (**CER-5**).\n\nSecond Boulton Report, para. 8.2.6 (**CER-5**); First Boulton Report, para. 8.5.3 (**CER-3**).\n\n249.\n\nMr. Boulton also analyzes the movements of listed prices of SC&T, Cheil, and New SC&T throughout the 2015 calendar year.252 He observes that there was a short-term increase in the listed prices of SC&T and Cheil in the eleven days following the Merger announcement.253 Mr. Boulton suggests that this may have been due to the market's \"overly optimistic\" reaction to the \"promise of significant revenue synergies presented in the Merger announcement\" or to the \"alleged market manipulation \u2026 currently the subject of ongoing criminal proceedings.\"254 In any event, he does not consider that \"this short-lived reaction \u2026 had any impact on [SC&T]'s Intrinsic Value.\"255 Mr. Boulton notes the decline in SC&T and Cheil share prices following the Merger Vote,256 and the fact that the New SC&T's share price in the four months following the Merger257 was almost identical to the range of combined prices of SC&T and Cheil in the five months prior to the Merger announcement.258 Accordingly, any expectations of synergies \"appear to have been driven by misinformation contained in the Merger Announcement\" and \"short-lived because there was no meaningful fundamental improvement to the businesses of [SC&T] or Cheil that could have reasonably been expected to result from the Merger.\"259\n\nSecond Boulton Report, paras. 8.2.13-8.2.44 and Figure 22 (**CER-5**).\n\nSecond Boulton Report, n. 234 (**CER-5**).\n\nSecond Boulton Report, paras. 8.2.16-8.2.19 (**CER-5**).\n\nSecond Boulton Report, paras. 8.2.17-8.2.21 (**CER-5**).\n\nSecond Boulton Report, paras. 8.2.26-8.2.31 (**CER-5**). Anticipating questions about why SC&T and Cheil prices did not begin to decline sooner than the date of the Merger vote, Mr. Boulton speculates that (i) \"[t]his may have been because some shareholders waited to see the result of the vote before selling their shares\" or (ii) \"due to the alleged market manipulation in support of the Merger.\" Second Boulton Report, para. 8.2.30 (**CER-5**).\n\nSecond Boulton Report, paras. 8.2.32-8.2.37, 8.2.42 (**CER-5**). Mr. Boulton submits that during the \"Merger Event Period\" between the Merger Announcement Date and the Merger Completion Date, the prices of SC&T and Cheil witnesses heightened volatility and speculation and traded outside the normal trading range outside of the Merger Event Period. Mr. Boulton does not regard these allegedly inflated prices to be a reliable indicator of the Intrinsic Value of the Merged Entity. Second Boulton Report, paras. 8.2.39-8.2.41 (**CER-5**).\n\nSecond Boulton Report, para. 8.2.28-8.2.29, 8.2.36, n. 247 (**CER-5**).\n\nSecond Boulton Report, para. 8.2.5, n. 223 (**CER-5**).\n\n250.\n\nMr. Boulton concludes that his analysis suggests that the KRW 2.1 trillion of synergies predicted by the NPS was not realistic.260 He adds that \"it is readily observable that [SC&T] and Cheil's core operating businesses primarily operated in dissimilar industries and geographies, each with diverse and largely non-overlapping operations, customers and sales channels,\" thus limiting the opportunities for operational synergies.261\n\nFirst Boulton Report, para. 8.3.70 (**CER-3**).\n\nFirst Boulton Report, para. 8.1.2 (**CER-3**). *See also* First Boulton Report, para. 8.3.67 (**CER-3**).\n\n251.\n\nMoreover, while there was the potential to achieve financial synergies, such synergies were not likely to be high in value at the enterprise level (since both SC&T and Cheil had significant cash balances and access to financing without the Merger) or at the shareholder level (since shareholders in both companies likely had easier and less costly paths to diversification than the Merger).262\n\nFirst Boulton Report, para. 8.3.69 (**CER-3**).\n\n252.\n\nFinally, Mr. Boulton considers that neither the \"brand royalty synergies\" nor the \"revenue synergies\" anticipated by the NPS itself would offset the net economic loss.263\n\nSecond Boulton Report, paras. 8.4.1-8.4.7 (**CER-5**).\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nThe Respondent's expert Professor Bae notes that mergers within emerging market business groups could be considered either value-enhancing or value-destroying (due to the potential of tunneling).264 However, he opines that a sample of mergers between 2000 and 2019 suggests the Korean stock market \"no longer generally perceived *chaebol* mergers to be value-destroying.\"265\n\nExpert Report of Professor Ki-hong Bae dated 12 November 2020 (\"Bae Report\"), paras. 39-40 (**RER-5**).\n\nBae Report, paras. 40-41 and Appendix E (**RER-5**).\n\n254.\n\nAccording to Professor Bae, it was common knowledge among investors in Korea that \"JY Lee wanted to assume his father's position and control power over the [Samsung Group].\"266 As such, Professor Bae opines that JY Lee's motivation to maintain control of the Samsung Group was enough of a signal to the market to cause the share prices to be revalued in expectation of the Merger, so that the share price of Cheil (in which JY Lee had a 23.34% ownership) would increase while the share price of SC&T (in which JY Lee had no ownership) would decrease, irrespective of any alleged manipulation of share prices by JY Lee.267\n\nBae Report, para. 44 (**RER-5**).\n\nBae Report, para. 44 (**RER-5**); Hearing Transcript, Day 6, pp. 111:11-24, 112:22 \u2013 113:2.\n\n255.\n\nProfessor Dow points out that a number of analysts at the time expected synergies to result from the Merger.268 Based on the share price reactions to the Merger, which according to him is \"the standard approach when the companies involved are publicly listed and traded in efficient markets,\" Professor Dow submits that the positive reaction of both SC&T and Cheil share prices to the Merger announcement, as well as the parallel fall in share prices of SC&T's competitors in the construction sector, suggests that the market expected synergies from the Merger.269\n\nRejoinder, para. 490(c), 501; Second Expert Report of Professor James Dow dated 12 November 2020 (\"Second Dow Report\"), paras. 154-64 (**RER-3**), *referring to* Shinhan Investment Corp., Samsung C&T: Merger with Cheil Industries announced, 27 May 2015, p. 1 (**DOW-68**) (\"the merger was intended to enhance core competitiveness and secure growth engine\"); UBS, \"Samsung C&T: Merge or not to merge?

Professor Dow also examined returns among SC&T's comparable companies in the trading sector, finding more mixed but directionally consistent results. *See* Second Dow Report, paras. 163-64 and Figure 16 (**RER-3**).\n\n256.\n\nProfessor Dow suggests that the trades in SC&T and Cheil by entities of Elliott should be considered as a whole, regardless of which Elliott entity made a particular transaction; in his view, Mr. Smith's testimony confirmed that trades were managed \"on a consolidated basis.\"270 Professor Dow notes that focusing only on SC&T's loss, without netting off the gain from Cheil, could \"create an opportunistic or windfall litigation gain from a trading strategy, a merger arbitrage that was an integrated bet,\" *i.e.* that the share price of Cheil would move in the opposite direction to SC&T's share price.271\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 8, p. 8:11-13.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 8, pp. 7:3-13, 8:16-20.\n\n**D.

At the time of the hearing, the decisions of the Seoul High Court in 2018 with respect to the indictments remained on appeal before the Korean Supreme Court or had been remanded by the Supreme Court for further proceedings. *See* Rejoinder, Annex A: Updated Table of Korean Court Proceedings, pp. 295-98.\n\n265.\n\nThe proceedings brought to light two private meetings between President Park and JY Lee, including meetings held on 15 September 2014 and 25 July 2015, during which President Park allegedly requested JY Lee to sponsor certain \"preferred projects.\"291 The Parties disagree as to whether the Park administration's support for the Merger was a *quid pro quo* or was otherwise linked to President Park's \"preferred projects,\" and in particular whether the Korean courts have found that the NPS vote in favor of the Merger was delivered in exchange for bribes.292\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, paras. 139-40; Statement of Defence, para. 157-58.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 139; Statement of Defence, para, 152.\n\n**(a) The evidentiary value of indictments and court findings**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that the Tribunal may rely on the factual findings of the Korean courts unless the Tribunal has been presented with evidence to the contrary, in which case it should weigh the evidence to reach its own factual conclusions.293 There is also no dispute between the Parties that in reaching affirmative findings of fact in criminal matters the Korean courts apply a higher standard of proof (*i.e.* beyond a reasonable doubt) than the standard applicable in this arbitration (*i.e.* balance of probabilities).294\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 110; Respondent's PHB, para. 45.\n\nReply, para. 172; Respondent's PHB, para. 108.\n\n267.\n\nThe Parties however disagree on the evidentiary value of the factual allegations made in prosecutorial indictments.295\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 110; Respondent's PHB, para. 40.\n\n268.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Tribunal can rely on the factual allegations in the indictments because (i) indictments in the ROK are issued only if there is sufficient evidence to meet the criminal standard of proof (*i.e.* beyond a reasonable doubt);296 and (ii) the PPO is, in any event, a State organ, whose statements the Respondent cannot disavow in this arbitration.297 In the Claimant's view, the referral of a case to the Indictment Deliberation Panel,298 or any non-binding recommendations by such panel (which in the present case recommended not to indict JY Lee and other Samsung executives), is irrelevant to the evidentiary value of the indictments in the context of treaty claims.299\n\nThe Claimant explains that the required standard of proof under the ROK's Prosecution Practice Manual is more stringent than the \"probable cause\" standard applied by prosecutors in the United States. *See* Claimant's PHB, para. 108, *referring to* Prosecution Practice Manual I: Law Practice Course (2018), p. 14 (**CLA-196**); Claimant's Reply PHB, para. 25.\n\nClaimant's PHB, paras. 108-10; Claimant's Reply PHB, para. 25. *See also* Claimant's PHB, para. 105.\n\nAn Indictment Deliberation Panel comprises ten to fifteen Korean citizens from various fields to review each potential indictment and to serve as \"a check on (although not a bar to)\" the PPO's discretion to issue indictments. Respondent's PHB, para. 44.\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 26.\n\n269.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the indictments represent \"unproven charges\" and include assertions that have been rejected by the Korean courts.300 Contrary to what the Claimant alleges, the Respondent submits that Korean prosecutors have the sole discretion to determine whether to issue an indictment and need not satisfy any standard of proof to do so.301 The Respondent notes that the PPO issued its indictment against JY Lee notwithstanding the Investigation Deliberation Committee's recommendation against it.302 The Respondent argues that the Tribunal has the discretion to consider whether the evidence underlying the allegations in the indictments is persuasive, and thus should be weighed like any other evidence in the record.303\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 40; Respondent's Reply PHB, para. 21.\n\nRespondent's PHB, paras. 42-4.

A few months later, President Park's confidante, Soon-sil Choi, was also convicted and sentenced to 20 years on charges of, *inter alia*, demanding and accepting bribery, conspiring with President Park to demand and accept bribes, and abuse of authority. *See* Amended Statement of Claim, para. 143(d), *referring to* Seoul High Court Case No. 2018Noh723-1, 24 August 2018, p. 3 (**C-285**).\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018, p. 1 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\nRejoinder, Annex A, p. 297. *See* Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap364-1, 6 April 2018 (**C-280**); Seoul High Court Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\n272.\n\nAs to the question whether President Park was solicited by JY Lee in relation to the Merger, the Seoul High Court determined that, \"[a]mong the individual issues alleged by the prosecutor,\" the Merger was an issue that was:\n\nalready resolved at the time of the one-on-one talks on July 25, 2015 when [President Park] had made a demand to sponsor the AA Center and others. Hence, in light of the aforementioned legal doctrine, the foregoing issues cannot be viewed as having *quid pro quo* relationships with [President Park]'s demand at the foregoing one-on-one talks and provision of money or other valuables pursuant thereto.308\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018, p. 51 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\n273.\n\nBy its decision dated 29 August 2019, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Seoul High Court on the ground that a technical error was made by the Seoul High Court when it issued one aggregate sentence in respect of all convictions of President Park, rather than issuing a separate sentence for each of the charges of which she had been found guilty.309 On 10 July 2020, the Seoul High Court in the remanded proceedings rendered two separate sentences against President Park, one for the bribery charge, and one for all other charges, which resulted in a total sentence of 20 years.310\n\nReply, para. 172(a)(i)-(ii), *referring to* Supreme Court Case No. 2018Do14303, 29 August 2019, p. 13 (**R-180**).\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2019No1962, 10 July 2020, pp. 2-3 (**R-314**).\n\n274.\n\nPresident Park's three aides, Blue House Senior Secretaries Byeong-u U and Jong-beom An, as well as Blue House Chief of Staff Ki-chun Kim, were also implicated in the corruption and have been convicted of criminal charges.311\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 142; Reply, para. 170(b).\n\n275.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Korean courts have confirmed that President Park abused her power to coerce the Samsung Group into paying bribes, in particular during the private meeting held on 15 September 2014 between President Park and JY Lee.312 Noting that the Samsung Group \"[could] only have agreed to these payments in the expectations that its millions would pay for the Government's support when [it] needed it,\" the Claimant characterizes the bribes as a \"down-payment on corrupt help from the Government aligned with the Government's predisposition and prejudice against Elliott.\"313 The Claimant refers to the testimony of an official of one of President Park's preferred organizations that benefitted from the proceeds of the bribery, who was told that the Samsung Group was providing financial support \"[b]ecause [Samsung] received help with the [SC&T-Cheil] merger.\"314 The Claimant rejects the Respondent's contention that it has mischaracterized the court's factual findings, arguing that the Korean courts have indeed confirmed that President Park accepted bribes specifically in exchange for assisting with the Samsung Group's succession plan.315\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 139, *referring to* Seoul High Court Case No. 2017No2556, 5 February 2018, pp. 116, 120-21

administration's ensuring that the NPS would vote in favor of the Merger.316 The Respondent points to findings of the Seoul High Court (not reversed by the Supreme Court) that the alleged *quid pro quo* relationship with JY Lee concerning the Samsung Group's succession plan could not have arisen before 25 July 2015, that is, after the Merger was approved.317 In particular, the Respondent refers to evidence that President Park, in return for the Samsung Group's financial support to the Korea Winter Sports Elite Center, backed certain *later* steps in the Samsung Group's succession plan, subsequent to the Merger approval.318 Accordingly, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's attempt to conflate the Respondent's support for the Merger with support for the Samsung Group's broader succession plan should be rejected, and that the findings of corruption by the Korean courts are wholly irrelevant to the shareholder vote on the Merger at issue in this arbitration.319\n\nStatement

proceedings against JY Lee**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nJY Lee has been charged with offering bribes to solicit President Park's support in relation to the Merger or the Samsung Group's succession plan, as well as other charges.320\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 156. *See* Rejoinder, Annex A, pp. 296-97; \"[Exclusive] We release the indictment against Jae-yong Lee in full,\" Ohmy News, 10 September 2020, p. 59 (**R-316**).\n\n278.\n\nOn 25 August 2017, the Seoul Central District Court sentenced JY Lee to five years in prison after finding him guilty on five charges.321 On the question of bribery, the Court found that the Samsung Group bribed President Park and Soon-sil Choi in the expectation that they would assist in facilitating the Samsung Group's succession plan.322\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 143(b), *referring to* \"Samsung heir jailed 5 years for bribery,\" The Korea Herald, 25 August 2017 (**C-76**).\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 143(b), *referring to* \"Samsung heir jailed 5 years for bribery,\" The Korea Herald, 25 August 2017 (**C-76**).\n\n279.\n\nThe finding of bribery was partially upheld by the Seoul High Court on 5 February 2018, when the Court ruled that, at President Park's direction, the Samsung Group transferred about USD 3 million to Soon-sil Choi for her personal use, \"fully aware\" that this constituted bribery.323\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2017No2556, 5 February 2018, pp. 61, 106-09 (**C-80**).\n\n280.\n\nBy its decision dated 29 August 2019, the Supreme Court found that the Seoul High Court had applied an incorrect standard in examining the evidence that the Samsung Group's succession plan was the subject of an unjust solicitation in the context of its finding that JY Lee was not guilty of bribery.324 Accordingly, the Supreme Court remanded to the Seoul High Court the question of whether the previous factual findings supported a conviction for JY Lee on the charge of bribery.325\n\nSupreme Court Case No. 2018Do2738, 29 August 2019, p. 28 (**R-178**).\n\nSupreme Court Case No. 2018Do2738, 29 August 2019, p. 28 (**R-178**).\n\n281.\n\nThere have been further criminal investigations into the Samsung Group and its officials in relation to alleged accounting fraud and manipulation of the SC&T and Cheil share prices prior to the Merger, including the PPO Indictment alleging that JY Lee manipulated the SC&T and Cheil share prices.326\n\nReply, para. 172(d).\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimant underscores that the Supreme Court remanded to the Seoul High Court only a specific question, leaving the previous factual findings undisturbed.327 The Claimant highlights that the PPO Indictment alleges the existence of a corrupt presidential *quid pro quo* specifically in relation to the Merger, which formed the backdrop to the illegal intervention by the ROK government and caused the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger.328\n\nReply, para. 172(c).\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 38(b), 39.\n\n283.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates its position that the question of whether a connection exists between the alleged bribery and the Merger has not been resolved by the Korean courts.329 Specifically, the Respondent asserts that the Seoul High Court in the JY Lee criminal proceedings \"did not hold that Mr. JY Lee promised to pay bribes or made an improper solicitation for a favor from Ms. Park during the meeting in September 2014.\"330 As discussed above, the Respondent also highlights that, in President Park's proceedings, the Supreme Court did not find that bribes were paid for direct support of the Merger.331\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 159.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 157, *referring to* Seoul High Court Case No. 2017 No2556, 5 February 2018, pp. 38, 91

Hong**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nOn 8 June 2017, the Seoul Central District Court found Minister Moon and CIO Hong guilty of misfeasance in public office, among other offences.332\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 70-73 (**C-69**).\n\n285.\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court determined that Minister Moon abused his authority by exerting pressure on CIO Hong to induce votes in favor of the Merger, infringing upon the independence of the NPS, and in doing so, compelling others to perform contrary to their official duties.333 The Court further found that Minister Moon committed perjury during the parliamentary investigation hearing on 30 November 2016 by testifying that the MHW neither intervened in the Merger nor induced the approval of the Merger.334\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 6-7, 10, 59 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 10-11 (**C-69**).\n\n286.\n\nThe District Court similarly found that CIO Hong breached his fiduciary duties and caused the NPS to suffer loss by directing Mr. [REDACTED] to fabricate the synergy effect of the Merger and improperly soliciting votes in favor of the Merger from members of the Investment Committee.335\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 9, 17-18, 62 (**C-69**).\n\n287.\n\nOn 14 November 2017, the Seoul High Court affirmed the decision of the Seoul Central District Court.336 Additionally, noting that Mr. [REDACTED] Head of the NPS Research Team, fabricated figures suggesting economic synergies created by the Merger under the direction of Minister Moon and CIO Hong, the Seoul High Court recognized that the NPS held the \"casting vote\" to decide the Merger and that \"[a] considerable number of the Investment Committee members \u2026 would have voted against the Merger motion if they had known about the fabricated synergy effect.\"337\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, 14 November 2017

167.\n\n288.\n\nOn 14 April 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed the Moon/Hong appeal and upheld the findings of the Seoul High Court.338\n\nSupreme Court Case No. 2017Do19635, 14 April 2022 (**C-781**).\n\n289.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the findings of the Korean courts constitute \"evidence of clear illegality in the procedure and actions taken by [the Respondent] in relation to the Merger.\"339 In particular, the Claimant contends that the records reveal that the MHW instructed CIO Hong to \"have the Investment Committee decide on the [Merger],\" and precluded NPS employees from referring the Merger to the Experts Voting Committee.340 The Claimant further refers to the findings of the Seoul High Court that Minister Moon \"was at least aware of [President Park's] instruction to 'look into issues relating to the [NPS's] exercise of its voting rights on the Merger'\" and that he likely received the instruction either directly from President Park or one of her aides.341 The Seoul High Court also determined that such conduct by the MHW \"cannot be viewed as a rightful performance of duty.\"342\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 143(a)(ii).\n\nAmended Statement of Claim,

that the Respondent subverted the NPS's decision-making process regarding the Merger.343 Contrary to what the Claimant alleges, the Respondent submits that the Seoul High Court affirmed that the NPS's adoption of the open voting system344 was \"in efforts to better adhere to the [Voting Guidelines]\" and was \"not a violation of the procedural regulations relating to the exercise of voting rights and is not contrary to their official duties set forth by law.\"345 The Court also ruled that the NPS had not taken any unlawful steps as a result of the instruction by Minister Moon, \"save that [CIO] Hong 'reported' to the [MHW] that the NPS Investment Committee would decide the matter.\"346\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 160.\n\nThe open voting system allowed each of the twelve members of the Investment Committee to choose one of four voting options \u2013 in favor of, against, neutral, abstain \u2013 or abstain from the Committee vote.

Proceedings by Other Shareholders to Annul the Merger***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nOn 29 February 2016, Ilsung Pharmaceutical, a shareholder of SC&T with a 2.11% stake prior to the Merger, and several other minority shareholders filed a lawsuit seeking annulment of the Merger on grounds that the Merger Ratio was \"manifestly unfair\" and that the NPS's vote in favor of the Merger was defectively exercised under improper instructions from the MHW and misconduct of CIO Hong (the \"**Merger Annulment Proceedings**\").349\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 182.\n\n294.\n\nOn 19 October 2017, the Seoul Central District Court dismissed the shareholders' claims.350 The District Court found that the Merger Ratio was calculated in compliance with the Capital Markets Act, and absent evidence of market manipulation or unfair trading, the Merger Ratio could not be deemed \"manifestly unfair.\"351 Even if the Merger was part of the Samsung Group's succession plan at the expense of SC&T's shareholders, the Court noted that such purpose of the Merger could not be considered improper.352\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017 (**R-20**); Reply, para. 177.\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, pp. 17-19 (**R-20**); Reply, para. 177(b).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, pp. 11-12 (**R-20**).\n\n295.\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court further determined that the NPS's exercise of its voting rights by the Investment Committee, including the adoption of the open voting system, was in compliance with the Voting Guidelines and did not constitute a breach of trust by incurring an investment loss or damage to shareholder value.353 The Court noted that considering the professional experience of the members of the NPS Investment Committee, \"it appear[ed] more likely that [they] would make their decisions based on earnings or the shareholder value rather than be swayed by an individual's influence.\"354 As to the alleged intervention by the MHW, the Court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the NPS Chairman was aware of the intervention by the MHW or the conduct of CIO Hong.355\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, pp. 44-46 (**R-20**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, p. 45 (**R-20**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, pp. 41-42 (**R-20**).\n\n296.\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court's decision was appealed, but the appeals were subsequently withdrawn.356 Accordingly the decision is now final.357\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2017Na206657, 2 May 2022 (**R-388**).\n\nRespondent's Reply PHB, para. 19.\n\n297.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Seoul Central District Court's dismissal of the shareholder claims does not establish that the Merger was not improperly motivated to benefit the Lee family at the expense of the SC&T shareholders.358 Moreover, the Claimant observes that while a finding of a \"manifestly unfair\" ratio requires a high threshold of showing criminal market manipulation, evidence of such manipulation had only come into light after the Court's decision as a result of the investigations by the Korean prosecutors.359\n\nReply, para. 177(a).\n\nReply, para. 177(b).\n\n298.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, any issues relating to the Respondent's wrongdoing in relation to the Merger only arose indirectly in the annulment proceedings as the relevant question to the Court was whether the NPS Chairman was aware of the wrongful intervention of Minister Moon or the misconduct of CIO Hong, while their wrongful acts were not in question.360\n\nReply, para. 177(c).\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the court rulings in the Merger annulment proceedings do not support the Claimant's claims because they show that (i) the Merger Ratio was determined in accordance with the relevant statute; (ii) the NPS's exercise of its voting rights could not be considered illegal; and (iii) the decision of the Investment Committee did not constitute a breach of trust.361\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 183.\n\n***3. The NPS Internal Audit***\n-------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nIn June 2018, the NPS performed an internal audit to examine \"the propriety of the general procedures related to the exercise of voting rights in connection with the [M]erger proposal in July 2015,\" including the draft valuation reports on each company involved in the Merger, the calculation of the Merger synergy effect, and the calculation of Cheil's land value.362\n\nNPS Internal Audit Results related to Samsung C&T/Cheil Industries Merger, submitted with a screenshot of the NPS website showing publication of the NPS Internal Audit taken on 5 July 2018, 21 June 2018, p. 2 (**C-84**).\n\n301.\n\nThe public report of the audit concluded, in relation to the question whether there was any violation of duties through \"distortion of the appropriate merger ratio through coercive instruction regarding the merger proposal, manipulation of the synergy effect, improper calculation of [Cheil]-possessed land,\" that Mr. [REDACTED] the Head of the Research Team at the time of the Merger, was \"[r]esponsible for significant violation of duty of care, duty of preserving integrity and duty to oblige to the [Fund Operational Guidelines], corresponding to 'severe degree of misconduct and malicious intent.'\"363 Mr. [REDACTED] a member of the Research Team at the time of the Merger, was found to have violated the duty of care, corresponding to \"mild degree of misconduct and minor negligence.\"364 Mr. [REDACTED] another member of the Research Team at the time of the Merger, was also found to be negligent in the performance of his duties and breached the NPS's code of conduct.365\n\nNPS Internal Audit Results related to Samsung C&T/Cheil Industries Merger, submitted with a screenshot of the NPS website showing publication of the NPS Internal Audit taken on 5 July 2018, 21 June 2018. p. 4 (**C-84**).\n\nNPS Internal Audit Results related to Samsung C&T/Cheil Industries Merger, submitted with a screenshot of the NPS website showing publication of the NPS Internal Audit taken on 5 July 2018, 21 June 2018, p. 4 (**C-84**).\n\nNPS Internal Audit Results related to Samsung C&T/Cheil Industries Merger, submitted with a screenshot of the NPS website showing publication of the NPS Internal Audit taken on 5 July 2018, 21 June 2018, p. 4 (**C-84**).\n\n**IV.

The Respondent's Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nIn the Statement of Defence, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DISMISS the Claimant's claims in their entirety;\n\n(b) in the alternative, DECLARE that even if the ROK violated the Treaty, the Claimant is not entitled to any award of damages;\n\n(c) ORDER the Claimant to pay all costs and fees for this arbitration and all related proceedings on a full indemnity basis, including the administrative fees and costs incurred, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of any experts appointed by it, and the ROK's legal costs (both internal and external) and disbursements for this arbitration; and\n\n(d) ORDER such other and further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.370\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 643.\n\n307.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DISMISS the Claimant's claims in their entirety;\n\n(b) ORDER the Claimant to pay all costs and fees for this arbitration and all related proceedings on a full indemnity basis, including the administrative fees and costs incurred, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of any experts appointed by it, and the ROK's legal costs (both internal and external) and disbursements for this arbitration; and\n\n(c) ORDER such other and further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.371\n\nRejoinder, para. 544.\n\n308.\n\nIn the Respondent's PHB and Reply PHB, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DISMISS the Claimant's claims in their entirety;\n\n(b) ORDER that the Claimant shall, within 30 days of it or any Elliott Group entity receiving a \"Top Up Payment\" under the Settlement Agreement, pay an amount equivalent to the \"Top Up Payment\" to the ROK;\n\n(c) ORDER the Claimant to pay all costs and fees for this arbitration and all related proceedings on a full indemnity basis, including the administrative fees and costs incurred, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of any experts appointed by it, and the ROK\"s legal costs (both internal and external) and disbursements for this arbitration; and\n\n(d) ORDER such other and further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.372\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 236; Respondent's Reply PHB, para. 98.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n309.\n\nThe Respondent raises four objections to jurisdiction and admissibility: (i) none of the impugned acts of the Respondent and the NPS constitute \"measures adopted or maintained\" by the Respondent, as required by Article 11.1 of the Treaty; (ii) the actions of the NPS, including the Merger vote, are not attributable to the Respondent; (iii) the Claimant's ownership of shares and swaps in SC&T is not a protected investment under the Treaty; and (iv) the Claimant's claims constitute an abuse of process.\n\n310.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's objections based on a number of arguments, which are set out below in the respective sections.\n\n**A. Whether the Claimant's Claims Arise Out of \"Measures Adopted or Maintained\" by the Respondent**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nArticle 11.1.1 of the Treaty governs the scope and coverage of the Treaty in relation to investment:\n\n**ARTICLE 11.1: SCOPE AND COVERAGE**\n\n1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) investors of the other Party;\n\n(b) covered investments; and\n\n(c) with respect to Articles 11.8 and 11.10, all investments in the territory of the Party.\n\n***1. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Respondent submits that none of the acts of which the Claimant complains are \"measures adopted or maintained\" by the Respondent, pursuant to Article 11.1 of the Treaty. Accordingly, the Respondent submits that its consent to arbitrate does not extend to such acts.\n\n**(a) Interpretation of the term \"measure\"**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, in order to constitute a \"measure\" that triggers the protection of the Treaty, an act of the host State must involve \"some kind of legislative, regulatory, or administrative rule-making and practice.\"373 In support of its contention, the Respondent cites various dictionaries which define \"measure\" as a \"proposed legislative act,\"374 a \"legislative enactment proposed or adopted\"375 and a \"legislative bill.\"376 On this basis, the Respondent argues that commercial acts or mere policy initiatives do not qualify as \"measures.\"377\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 203; Rejoinder, para. 20.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 205(a), *citing* Merriam-Webster Dictionary (online), \"Measure,\" accessed on 18 September 2019 (**R-183**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 205(b), *citing* Oxford English Dictionary (online), \"Measure,\" accessed on 18 September 2019 (**R-184**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 205(c), *citing* Lexico (Oxford University) (online), \"Measure,\" accessed on 18 September 2018 (**R-185**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 205. *See* Rejoinder, paras. 25-26.\n\n314.\n\nThe Respondent argues that in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**VCLT**\"), the ordinary meaning of the term \"measure\" must apply \"in the context of the Treaty's purpose of providing protections to attract foreign investors, without paralyzing the State's ability to act.\"378 According to the Respondent, the broader context of the Treaty confirms that the term \"measure\" refers to legislative or regulatory rule-making and enforcement by the State.379 As stated in the preamble of the Treaty, the Treaty was entered into by the State Parties \"to establish clear and mutually advantageous rules governing their trade and investment\" and that developing these legislative and regulatory rules in each State in accordance with these principles is indeed the Treaty's object and purpose.380\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 204, *citing* Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 23 May 1969, Art. 31(1) (**RLA-5**); Rejoinder, para. 21.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 211, 213.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 211-12, *citing* Treaty, Preamble (**C-1**).\n\n315.\n\nNoting that Article 1.4 of the Treaty defines \"measure\" as \"any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice,\" the Respondent contends that other uses of the term \"measure\" within the Treaty confirm that \"measures\" must involve an exercise of the State's legislative or regulatory rule-making and its enforcement. The Respondent refers to the following examples:\n\n(a) Article 1.3 of the Treaty requires that the States Parties \"ensure that all necessary measures are taken in order to give effect to the provisions of the [Treaty];\"381\n\n(b) Article 3.3 refers to \"Agricultural Safeguard Measures\" and permits each Contracting Party to apply a measure \"in the form of a higher import duty\" on an agricultural good;382\n\n(c) The term \"Non-Tariff Measures\" in Section D of Chapter 2 includes \"any prohibition or restriction on the importation of any good,\" any new or modified import licensing procedure, or \"any duty, tax, or other charge on the export of any good;\"383\n\n(d) Section E of Chapter 2 addresses \"Other Measures\" which specifically cover \"existing laws and regulations governing the manufacture of [distinctive alcohol] products, and \u2026 any modifications it makes to those laws and regulations;\"384 and\n\n(e) Chapter 20 addresses \"laws, regulations and all other measures\" in reference to acts necessary to fulfil each Contracting Party's obligations under the multilateral environmental agreements listed in Annex 20-A (\"covered agreements\").385\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 212(a); Rejoinder, para. 22(b).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 212(d).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 212(b), *citing* Treaty, Articles 2.8.1, 2.9.2(b), 2.11 (**C-1**); Rejoinder, para. 22(c).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 212(c), *citing* Treaty, Article 2.13.3 (**C-1**); Rejoinder, para. 22(c).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 212(e); Rejoinder, para. 22(a).\n\n316.\n\nThe Respondent argues that investment tribunals have endorsed the Respondent's position that \"not all governmental acts necessarily constitute 'measures,'\"386 such that contractual breaches *per se*,387 certain judicial acts,388 and an \"un-enacted legislative proposal\" were not considered to constitute \"measures\" under the relevant treaty.389 The Respondent further notes that the International Court of Justice (the \"**ICJ**\") in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction* case recognized that the term \"measure\" encompasses \"statutes, regulations and administrative actions.\"390\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 206, *citing* *Mesa Power Group, LLC v.

Ghana*.399\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 13, *referring to* *Gustav F W Hamester v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, para. 331 (**CLA-6**).\n\n**(b) Whether the conduct of the Blue House and the Ministry constitutes \"measures\" within the meaning of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the influence on the Merger vote allegedly exercised by officials of the Blue House and the Ministry cannot constitute an actionable \"measure\" under the Treaty irrespective of whether those actions are considered unlawful under Korean law.400\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 220, 225, 227; Rejoinder, para. 28.\n\n321.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that such conduct, which allegedly took place during the \"prelude\" to the Merger, did not in itself cause any cognizable loss and thus cannot constitute \"measures.\"401 The Respondent asserts that the NPS's Merger vote based on the Merger Ratio is the sole basis of the Claimant's claim in this arbitration.402 Accordingly, in the Respondent's view, the alleged improper conduct of the Blue House and the Ministry, namely instructing the NPS to \"monitor\" the Merger and to have the Investment Committee make the decision on the Merger vote, constitutes mere \"background allegations.\"403\n\nRejoinder, para. 28(b).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 221.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 221, 225, 227, Rejoinder, paras. 28(a)-(b); Respondent's Reply PHB, para. 9.\n\n322.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that the alleged instruction by the MHW to CIO Hong to have the Investment Committee decide on the Merger vote may be \"the only possible 'action' that the Claimant might point to\" in support of its claim. However, according to the Respondent, such action also occurred prior to the Merger vote.404\n\nRejoinder, para. 28(c).\n\n323.\n\nSecond, even if the alleged pressure from the Blue House and the MHW that the NPS vote in favor of the Merger were to be considered \"measures\" under the Treaty, the Respondent denies that it is a \"measure adopted or maintained\" under Article 11.1 of the Treaty.405 Since a measure is adopted only when an internal government deliberation process is completed, the Respondent argues that the alleged conduct represents, at most, the general pursuit of a policy initiative, in respect of which the Park administration allegedly used the weight of her office to influence the NPS.406\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 222.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 225.\n\n**(c) Whether the NPS's vote in favor of the Merger constitutes a \"measure\" within the meaning of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the NPS's vote in favor of the Merger does not constitute \"measures adopted or maintained\" by the Respondent as it was purely a commercial act exercised by a shareholder at its discretion for its own purpose.407 Specifically, the Respondent avers that such a shareholder vote is not a \"law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice\" within the meaning of Article 1.4 of the Treaty, nor a step in the process of passing or enforcing a law or administrative rule.408 According to the Respondent, even the Claimant's definition of the term \"measure\" \u2013 \"a governmental action, step, or omission\" \u2013 does not encapsulate such a commercial act.409\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 215; Rejoinder, para. 29(b).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 215, *citing* Treaty, Art. 1.4 (**C-1**); Rejoinder, para. 29(b).\n\nRejoinder, para. 29(b), *citing* Reply, para. 261.\n\n325.\n\nEven if the NPS's vote on the Merger could be attributed to the ROK,410 the Respondent contends that defining a purely commercial act as a \"measure\" under the Treaty would \"elevate improperly an 'ordinary transaction' between commercial actors into a Treaty dispute.\"411 Referring to *Azinian v. Mexico*, in which the tribunal rejected the notion that \"ordinary transactions with public authorities\" are protected by investment treaties, the Respondent contends that the \"slippery-slope concern\" raised by the *Azinian* tribunal is \"even more acute\" with respect to the commercial act at issue involving a shareholder vote that the NPS took unilaterally without any government action of any kind, whether legislative, regulatory or administrative.412\n\nThe Respondent rejects that the NPS's vote on the Merger is attributable to it.

United States* and *Resolute Forest Products v. Canada*, that the phrase \"relating to\" in the Treaty context requires the Claimant to show that a \"legally significant connection\" exists between the NPS vote to approve the Merger and the Claimant's investment in SC&T, and that the alleged harm suffered is not simply \"tangential or merely consequential.\"414 The Respondent notes that this understanding is shared by the United States.415 As such, the Respondent maintains that the \"relating to\" requirement involves something substantial, not merely \"more than just some collateral\" effect, as the Claimant suggests.416\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 229-33, *citing* *Methanex Corporation v.

The Tribunal's Determination***\n-------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe relevant provisions in determining whether the Claimant's claims arise out of \"Measures Adopted or Maintained by the Respondent\" are Article 11.1 and Article 1.4 of the Treaty. Article 11.1.1 deals with the \"Scope and Coverage\" of Chapter Eleven of the Treaty and provides:\n\n**Article 11.1: SCOPE AND COVERAGE**\n\n1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) investors of the other Party;\n\n(b) covered investments; and\n\n(c) with respect to Articles 11.8 and 11.10, all investments in the territory of the Party.\n\n349.\n\nArticle 1.4 of the Treaty, which contains a list of \"Definitions,\" provides that the term \"measure\" includes \"any law, regulation, procedure, requirement, or practice.\"\n\n350.\n\nAs summarized above, the Parties disagree as to (i) how the term \"measure\" should be interpreted; (ii) whether the conduct of the Blue House and the Ministry constitutes \"measures\" within the meaning of the Treaty; (iii) whether the NPS's vote in favor of the Merger constitutes a \"measure\" within the meaning of the Treaty; and (iv) whether the Respondent adopted or maintained measures \"relating to\" the Claimant and its investment.\n\n351.\n\nAs for the issue of interpretation, the Parties agree that the relevant rules of interpretation are those set out in Article 31 of the VCLT, which contains the \"general rule of treaty interpretation.\" According to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\" When read in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 1.4, and in the context of the Treaty as a whole, it is evident that the definition of the term \"measure\" in Article 1.4 is not exhaustive; Article 1.4 specifically provides that the term \"includes\" the types of conduct listed, which implies that it may \"include\" other types of conduct. Moreover, while the term \"measure\" is used in the Treaty primarily in the context of regulatory and administrative action, its use is not limited to such contexts but is used in a broader sense, governing not only regulatory and administrative action, but also State conduct (\"practice\"), including acts and omissions. This interpretation is supported, *inter alia*, by provisions such as Articles 2.13 and 13.14, which refer to \"recognition\" as a measure covered by the Treaty, and Annex 11-B (\"Expropriation\"), which envisages that an expropriation may result from \"[a]n action or a series of actions by a Party\" that \"interferes with a tangible or intangible property right in an investment\" or from \"an outright seizure,\" and \"government action.\"\n\n352.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that its jurisdiction extends to any \"measures adopted or maintained\" by the Respondent, in the broad sense of the term \"measures,\" including a \"practice\" or \"an action or a series of actions\" by the Respondent and other forms of \"government action,\" including acts and omissions.\n\n353.\n\nAs for the issue of whether the conduct of the Blue House and the Ministry constitutes \"measures\" within the meaning of the Treaty, the Respondent argues, as summarized above, that the sole basis of the Claimant's claims is the NPS's Merger vote. Accordingly, in the Respondent's view, the influence on the Merger vote allegedly exercised by officials of the Blue and House and the MHW cannot constitute an actionable measure under the Treaty, and in any event is not a \"measure adopted or maintained\" under Article 11.1 of the Treaty.\n\n354.\n\nThe Tribunal has found above that the term \"measure\" is used in the Treaty in a broad sense, governing any kind of \"government action.\" The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent's related argument that the Treaty does not cover the allegedly improper conduct of the Blue House and the MHW on the basis that these constitute mere \"background allegations\" that did not yet amount to a \"measure\" within the meaning of the Treaty.\n\n355.\n\nAs for the issue of whether the NPS's vote in favor of the Merger constitutes a \"measure\" within the meaning of the Treaty, the Respondent argues that this cannot be the case because the NPS's vote was a purely commercial act exercised by a shareholder. As such, according to the Respondent, it cannot qualify as a \"measure\" even under the Claimant's definition of the term \"measure\" \u2013 \"a governmental action, step, or omission.\" The Tribunal notes that the Respondent's argument is closely linked to its argument that the NPS's vote is not attributable to the Respondent under international law, and that it was not taken in the exercise of sovereign powers and therefore cannot constitute a breach of the Treaty. The Respondent's argument that the NPS's vote does not constitute a \"measure\" is therefore closely intertwined with the merits of the case and accordingly the Tribunal will consider the issue on the merits.\n\n356.\n\nAs for the issue of whether the Respondent adopted or maintained measures \"relating to\" the Claimant and its investment, as required under Article 11.1 of the Treaty, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's case does not meet this requirement, *inter alia,* because the \"relating to\" clause requires a \"legally significant connection\" between the measure in question and \"investors of a Party\" or \"covered investments,\" a connection which the Respondent alleges to be lacking. The Claimant agrees that the \"relating to\" clause requires a \"legally significant connection,\" but argues that such a connection exists in this case.\n\n357.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, the same as for any other term of the Treaty, the interpretation of the terms \"relating to\" must be based on the general rule of treaty interpretation set out in Article 31 of the VCLT. According to that general rule, the terms of a treaty must be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" Therefore, the Tribunal must interpret the terms \"relating to\" in accordance with their ordinary meaning in their context and light of the object and purpose of the Treaty. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the ordinary meaning of the terms \"relating to\" denotes a relationship between the measure in question and \"investors of a Party\" or \"covered investments.\" Before addressing the ordinary meaning of the terms \"relating to\" in more detail, the Tribunal notes that the proximate context of this expression includes the term \"measure,\" which is to be interpreted broadly, as determined above. The context therefore indicates that the terms \"relating to\" must denote a relationship that is sufficiently broad to accommodate the broad meaning of the term \"measure.\" In addition, the context of Article 11.1 as a whole also suggests that the relationship denoted by \"relating to\" must have a sufficiently broad scope to relate the measures to *both* \"investors of a Party\" *and* \"covered investments.\"\n\n358.\n\nThe terms \"relating to\" must also be interpreted \"in light of\" the object and purpose of the Treaty. In contrast with investment contracts, investment treaties \u2013 including the Treaty \u2013 are generally meant to apply to a class of anonymous or undetermined investors \u2013 any investment that falls within the scope of application of an investment treaty *ratione temporis*, *ratione personae*, and *ratione materiae* is generally protected under the treaty. There is therefore no requirement of \"privity\" or \"immediacy\" between the host State and the protected investor, and accordingly it is not necessary for the host State even to be aware of a foreign investor having invested in the territory of the host State, or of its investment, for such investment to be protected under the treaty in question. Indeed, foreign investment is often based exclusively on transactions between private parties and hence may not directly involve the host State at all. This does not mean, however, that such investments are not protected under the applicable investment treaty.\n\n359.\n\nAs noted above, the interpretation of the Treaty must also take into account the ordinary meaning of the terms \"relating to.\" In the present case, the Treaty makes clear that its scope of application, insofar as it relates to \"Investment,\" is limited to \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party *relating to*: (a) investors of the other Party; [and] (b) covered investments.\" (Emphasis added.) The ordinary meaning of the terms \"relating to,\" in this context, is narrower than that of other similar terms; for instance, the Treaty does not say in Chapter Eleven, as it does in some other chapters, that it applies to any investor or investment \"affected\" by the measures adopted or maintained by a Party. The \"relating to\" clause therefore cannot be interpreted so broadly as to cover any adverse impact on an investor or a covered investment, even if such impact was not reasonably foreseeable by the host State at the time when it adopted or maintained the measure. It follows that the terms \"relating to\" in the Treaty must have a meaning that, on the one hand, is broad enough to denote a relationship between a measure and a class of anonymous or undetermined investors or covered investments but, on the other hand, is narrower than denoting a relationship based merely on an *ex post* determination of an adverse effect on an investor or a covered investment. At the same time, the search for such a narrower or \"legally significant\" meaning cannot be used as a backdoor to create a requirement of \"privity\" or \"immediacy\" between the investor and the host State.471 Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that a measure \"relates to\" an investor or an investment under the Treaty if it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the measure in question was adopted or maintained that it may adversely affect an investor of the other Party or a covered investment, as the case may be.472 Such a relation between a measure and an investor or a covered investment can also be said to be \"legally significant,\" as argued by the Parties by reference to the *Methanex* award.473\n\nIn the present case, such a relationship would appear to exist, however, as the Korean Government and the NPS were clearly aware of the Claimant's investment in SC&T, and the position the Claimant had taken in relation to the Merger. See Section VI.A below.\n\nThis is because the obligations that are set out after Article 11.1 of the Treaty are worded differently in terms of whether they apply to an investor of the other Party, to such an investor's covered investment, to both, or to all investors in the territory of the State, including domestic investors. Article 11.5, for example, applies to covered investments, not to investors.\n\n*Cf*. *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para. 147 (**RLA-22**). It should be noted that the *Methanex* award was issued under the NAFTA, and not the Treaty.\n\n360.\n\nIn the circumstances of the present case, this test is clearly met. Not only was the effect of the Respondent's intervention in the NPS's vote on the Claimant's investment reasonably foreseeable at the time the intervention occurred; as a matter of fact, the Respondent foresaw at the time that the Claimant's investment would be adversely affected by the intervention, as it was very much a matter in the public domain, and well known to the Blue House, the MHW, and the NPS, that the Claimant opposed the Merger.474 Moreover, the evidence shows that Minister Moon and CIO Hong in particular invoked the Claimant's opposition to the Merger as an argument to persuade other officials of the MHW and the NPS, and the members of the NPS's Investment Committee, to support the Merger.475 In the circumstances, the Claimant need not establish that the Claimant itself, or its investment, were \"targeted\" by the measures in question for there to exist a relationship of \"relating to\" between such measures and the Claimant's investment. Nor does the Claimant need to show, for the purposes of establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction, that the loss or damage for which it seeks compensation in this arbitration was proximately caused by the Respondent's conduct. These are matters of causation, and as such they belong to the merits of the case.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp, 4, 17, 44, 55, 66-67 (**C-69**); Seoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, 14 November 2017, pp. 9, 25, 29, 37, 53, 78, 85 (**C-79/R-153**).

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to show that the NPS's conduct in voting in favor of the Merger is attributable to the Respondent under Article 11.1.3 of the Treaty.477\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 238-39.\n\n**(a) The applicable standard on attribution**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Article 11.1.3 of the Treaty is *lex specialis* and displaces general international law, as reflected in Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles.478 In the Respondent's view, to implicate Treaty protection, conduct must strictly fall within the confines of Articles 11.1.3(a) or (b), in which the Contracting Parties have exhaustively documented the agreed grounds of attribution.479\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 241, 245-46, *referring to* Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v.

The provision, however, was incorporated in the initial draft of the United States dated 19 May 2006. Statement of Defence, n. 362.\n\n365.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the ILC Articles become relevant only to the extent that the Treaty does not exclude them.480 To the extent that ILC Articles 4 and 5 are \"broadly similar\" to the requirements in Article 11.1.3(a) and (b) of the Treaty, the Respondent asserts that two ILC Articles can be a \"useful guide.\"481\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 295.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 241, 245-46; Respondent's PHB, para. 27.\n\n366.\n\nThe Respondent submits that ILC Article 8 however cannot provide an alternative basis for attribution because Article 11.1.3 is *lex specialis*482 and sets forth no equivalent ground of attribution.483 The Respondent further contends that the principles of attribution reflected in ILC Articles 9 to 11 can be relied upon to support attribution under the Treaty only if they fall within the scope of Article 11.1.3.484 In this respect, the Respondent notes that investment tribunals have recognized that express treaty language may limit the circumstances under which the acts of an entity may be attributable to the State.485\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 295 Respondent's PHB, para. 26; Respondent's Reply PHB, para. 17(a).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 249, 302-04; Rejoinder, para. 92; Respondent's PHB, para. 27.\n\nRespondent's PHB, paras. 28-29.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 298-300, *referring to* *Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v.

Professor SS Kim explains that \"central administrative agencies\" are divided into three categories: *Bu* (ministries under the President), *Cheo* (ministries under the Prime Minister), and *Cheong* (agencies established under the control of a *Bu*). According to Professor SS Kim, all *Bu*, *Cheo* and *Cheong* which are affiliated to a constitutional institution (*i.e.* to the President and Prime Minister) are properly considered as State organs. First SS Kim, para. 18 (**RER-2**).\n\n372.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Article 2(2) of the Government Organization Act provides an exhaustive list of the \"central administrative agencies\" that have been set up under the Government Organization Act and other individual statutes.501 Further, the Respondent underscores that when an entity is to be considered part of the State under Korean law, an amendment will be made to the Government Organization Act to include that entity in the list.502 Consequently, following the opinion of Professor Kim, the Respondent takes the view that the fact that the NPS is not included under Article 2(2) of the Government Organization Act as a \"central administrative agency\" is \"sufficient to conclude that the NPS is not part of the organic structure of the Korean government.\"503\n\nRejoinder, paras. 48(e)-(f);

First SS Kim Report, para. 14 (**RER-2**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 267.\n\n374.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the concept of \"indirect administrative agency\" is well-established in Korean administrative law and denotes \"an independent public organization or public corporation that does not form part of the vertical hierarchy of the State (and also does not make such an agency a *de facto* part of the State)\" which performs \"specific public duties in a more independent and efficient manner.\"507\n\nRejoinder, para. 52; Second SS Kim, paras. 31-34 (**RER-4**).\n\n375.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent maintains that the designation of the NPS as a \"fund management type quasi-governmental institution\" under Article 4(1) of the Public Institutions Act does not have an impact on its status of an institution under Korean law.508 Specifically, the Respondent notes that the reason for such classification is that their \"public nature\" makes such entities subject to greater checks and balances and transparency in their functioning.509 As stated by Professor Kim, these checks and balances also apply to private bodies and do not result in those institutions being State organs.510 The Respondent notes that there are more than 300 public institutions in Korea, including a casino and a home shopping entity, and that the Claimant's expert, Professor Choong-kee Lee also agrees that not \"all public institutions form part of the State organ or the State organization.\"511\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 268, *referring to* Act on the Management of Public Institutions, 28 May 2014, Art. 4(1) (**C-56**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 268, *citing* First SS Kim Report, para. 57 (**RER-2**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 269;

First SS Kim Report, paras. 52-53 (**RER-2**).\n\n378.\n\nFinally, noting that investment tribunals have considered separate legal personality of an entity as a \"decisive criterion\" in determining whether that entity is a *de jure* State organ,515 the Respondent argues that the NPS is not a *de jure* State organ because it (i) is established as a corporation with separate legal personality; (ii) has the power to acquire, hold, and dispose of property in its own name; (iii) is subject to corporate tax; (iv) may sue and be sued in its own name; and (v) is a private law entity government by provisions of civil law.516\n\nRejoinder, para. 53, *referring to* *Kristian Alm\u00e5s and Geir Alm\u00e5s v.

The Respondent alleges that the Claimant's presentation of the facts in relation to the 10 steps are flawed. See Section VII.B.2 below.\n\n399.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that the evidence offered by the Claimant shows only that the Blue House was concerned about the management of the Samsung Group and considered the NPS's investments relevant to JY Lee's succession in respect of the Samsung Group.555 However, nothing in relation to the supposed \"monitoring\" request from President Park on the status of the Merger \"hints at an instruction having been made to the NPS in relation to the Merger.\"556\n\nRejoinder, para. 101(a)(i)-(ii). See para. 758 below.\n\nRejoinder, para. 101(a)(iii).\n\n400.\n\nSecond, the Respondent asserts that there is no evidence that the MHW gave instructions to the Investment Committee to approve the Merger and bypass the Experts Voting Committee.557 The Respondent contends that evidence only supports the conclusion that Blue House official Mr. Ki-nam Kim sought updates on the status of the NPS's handling of the Merger.558 The Respondent further contends that evidence only shows that the MHW instructed CIO Hong to have the Investment Committee \"first make a decision,\" without specifying that the Investment Committee must decide in favor of the Merger.559\n\nRejoinder, para. 101(b).\n\nRejoinder, para. 101(b)(i).\n\nRejoinder, para. 101(b)(iii).\n\n401.\n\nEven assuming *arguendo* that an instruction by the MHW to approve the Merger existed, the Respondent points out that the most the Claimant could show is that such instruction would have been given to a limited number of individuals, such as CIO Hong and Mr. [REDACTED] and not to the eleven members of the Investment Committee.560 In this respect, the Respondent highlights that the Seoul High Court has not ruled that the MHW instructed any of the eleven individual members of the Investment Committee to vote in favor of the Merger.561\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 311; Rejoinder, para. 101(b)(ii).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 311, *referring to* Seoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, 14 November 2017, pp. 31-32 (**C-79/R-153**). The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Seoul High Court on limited grounds. See para. 288 above.\n\n402.\n\nThe Respondent likewise contends that the Claimant has not shown specific control of the State over the vote in favor of the Merger decided by the twelve individual members of the Investment Committee.562 In the Respondent's view, the record of the three-hour deliberation on the Merger issue refutes \"any claim that the outcome was pre-ordained or was controlled by\" the Respondent.563\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 312.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 313. *See also* Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, p. 45 (**R-20**).\n\n403.\n\nThird, the Respondent states that there is no evidence that the MHW instructed the NPS to fabricate calculations of an appropriate merger ratio and the synergy effect to be expected from the Merger because Mr. [REDACTED] did not attend the meetings where he allegedly received such instructions.564\n\nRejoinder, para. 101(c).\n\n404.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that events that allegedly occurred after the Investment Committee's vote on the Merger are irrelevant to the question of attribution of the NPS's vote on the Merger. This applies to the purported instruction from the MHW to the Investment Committee to \"stand by\" while CIO Hong spoke with the Blue House565 and the Experts Voting Committee meeting in which the MHW allegedly interfered.566\n\nRejoinder, para. 101(d)(i).\n\nRejoinder, para. 101(d)(ii).\n\n***2. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nThe Claimant invokes three separate grounds for attributing the conduct of the NPS to the Respondent: (i) the NPS constitutes a State organ under Article 11.1.3(a) of the Treaty, consistent with ILC Article 4; (ii) the NPS exercised delegated governmental powers for the purposes of Article 11.1.3(b) of the Treaty and ILC Article 5; and (iii) the NPS acted under direction and control of the Respondent for the purposes of ILC Article 8.567\n\nReply, para. 299; Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 60.\n\n**(a) The applicable standard on attribution**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the *lex specialis* in Article 11.1.3 of the Treaty is concordant with general international law on attribution and \"coexists with it, rather than excluding it.\"568 According to the Claimant, the application of the *lex specialis* principle under ILC Article 55 requires not only overlap in \"the same subject matter \u2026 dealt with by two provisions,\" but also \"some actual inconsistency between them, or else a discernible intention that one provision to exclude the other.\"569 Conversely, when two overlapping treaty provisions or obligations \"harmoniously co-exist,\" the Claimant asserts that they operate alongside each other.570\n\nReply, para. 299; Claimant's PHB, para. 64,\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 161, *citing* Commentary to ILC Articles, Art. 55, p. 140, para. 4 (**CLA-38**); Reply, para. 301; Claimant's PHB, para. 64.\n\nReply, paras. 301-02.\n\n407.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant submits that no actual inconsistency exists between Article 11.1.3 of the Treaty and ILC Article 8.571 Nor is there any discernible intention that the drafters of the Treaty intended to exclude general rules of international law.572 As the application of general international law cannot be presumed to be excluded by mere silence,573 the Claimant submits that the Tribunal should decide disputes \"in accordance with [the Treaty] and applicable rules of international law,\" including ILC Article 8, as directed under Article 11.22 of the Treaty.574\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 65.\n\nReply, para. 309; Claimant's PHB, paras. 65-66.\n\nReply, paras. 305, 309, *referring to* *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

The U.S. Submission***\n----------------------------\n\n435.\n\nThe United States submits that Article 11.1.3(a) of the Treaty applies to any State organ at the central, regional, or local level of government, consistent with the principles of attribution under customary international law.645 The text of Article 11.1.3(a) does not draw distinctions based on the type of conduct at issue, \"whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions.\"646\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 3.\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 3, n. 2, *citing* ILC Articles (with commentaries) (2001), Art. 4 (**CLA-38**).\n\n436.\n\nArticle 11.1.3(b) of the Treaty governs attribution of conduct of a non-governmental body to a Contracting Party, which requires that the conduct be governmental in nature and the measures adopted or maintained by the non-governmental body be undertaken \"in the exercise of powers delegated by\" the government or an authority of a Party.647 Thus, if the conduct of a non-governmental body falls outside the scope of the relevant delegation of authority, such conduct is not a \"measure[] adopted or maintained by a Party\" under Article 11.1 of the Treaty.648 In this respect, the United States refers to Article 16.9 of the Treaty, which defines \"delegation\" in the context of competition-related matters as including, *inter alia*, \"a legislative intent, and a government order, directive, or other act, transferring to the \u2026 state enterprise, or authorizing the exercise by the \u2026 state enterprise of, governmental authority.\"649\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 4, *citing* Treaty, Art. 11.1.3(b) (**C-1**).\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 4.\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 4, *citing* Treaty, Art. 16.9 (**C-1**).\n\n437.\n\nAccording to the United States, the circumstances in which a non-governmental body, such as a State entity, may exercise regulatory, administrative, or other governmental authority delegated by a Party in its sovereign capacity include \"the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions, or impose quotas, fees or other charges.\"650\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 5.\n\n***4. The Tribunal's Determination***\n-------------------------------------\n\n438.\n\nThe sole disagreement between the Parties regarding attribution relates to the conduct of the NPS.\n\n439.\n\nThe relevant provision in determining whether the NPS's conduct is attributable to the Respondent is Article 11.1.3 of the Treaty, which sets out the definition of \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party:\"\n\n**ARTICLE 11.1: SCOPE AND COVERAGE**\n\n...\n\n3. For purposes of this Chapter, **measures adopted or maintained by a Party** means measures adopted or maintained by\n\n(a) Central, regional, or local governments and authorities; and\n\n(b) Non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by central, regional, or local governments or authorities.\n\n440.\n\nThe Parties disagree on a number of points regarding the interpretation and application of this provision, including whether Article 11.1 constitutes a *lex specialis* and thus replaces and substitutes for the ILC Articles in their entirety, or whether the provision should be read together with the ILC Articles, and indeed whether the ILC Articles, in particular Article 8, remain applicable with the framework of the Treaty.\n\n441.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis of this issue must be based on Article 31 of the VCLT, which sets out the general rule of treaty interpretation. The specific terms of Article 11.1.3 must therefore be the starting point of the Tribunal's analysis; and on this basis, it should be noted at the outset that Article 11.1.3 does not deal expressly with attribution, and indeed does not even mention the term, but rather defines the State organs and entities that may maintain or adopt \"measures\" falling under the Treaty. The Tribunal therefore considers that the ILC Articles may be applied as guidance in the interpretation of Article 11.1.3, but only to the extent that the ILC Articles are consistent with the specific terms of Article 11.1.3; they cannot be relied upon to deviate from the clear terms of the provision.\n\n442.\n\nApplying these principles, the Tribunal notes that Article 11.1.3(a) of the Treaty reflects, in substance, Article 4 of the ILC Articles, which provides that the conduct of any \"State organ\" shall be considered an act of that State under international law, regardless of the type of government conduct at issue. Similarly, Article 11.1.3(a) provides that measures adopted or maintained by a Party means measures adopted or maintained by \"central, regional, or local governments and authorities,\" which are generally considered to be State organs.\n\n443.\n\nArticle 11.1.3(b) of the Treaty similarly reflects, in substance, Article 4 of the ILC Articles, which provides that \"[t]he conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\" Article 11.1.3(b) similarly provides that measures adopted or maintained by a Party means measures adopted or maintained by \"non-governmental bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by central, regional, or local governments or authorities.\"\n\n444.\n\nThe Parties appear to agree, and the Tribunal concurs with them, that the NPS cannot be considered a *de jure* State organ under Korean law. The NPS is organized as a corporation operating under private law651 and therefore cannot be considered formally, or *de jure,* a State organ under Korean law, which is the relevant point of reference under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.652 This is not, however, the end of the matter. First, Article 11.1.3 of the Treaty makes no reference to Korean law, and accordingly the determination of whether an organ is to be considered an organ of the State cannot be based solely on Korean law but must also take into account the relevant facts. Second, although the NPS is formally a corporation, it was created by a statute \u2013 the National Pension Act.653 Moreover, although the NPS is a legal entity separate from the Korean State, this cannot be determinative, as under Korean law local government authorities also have a separate legal personality and they are nonetheless indisputably State organs.654 The NPS is also both functionally and financially closely linked to, and effectively part of, the Korean State. The function of the NPS is to manage and administer the National Pension Fund, which under Korean law belongs to the State, and not to the NPS.655 Similarly, under Korean law, when the NPS exercises its voting rights to acquire shares, the entity that acquires the shares in question is the State, and not the NPS.656 Contributions to the Fund are not voluntary, as Korean citizens are required by law to contribute to the Fund under a specific delegation by the MHW. The NPS's operational expenses are funded from the national State budget and the NPS's annual budget proposal must be approved by the MHW. The NPS's officials are appointed and supervised by the Minister of Health and Welfare. The NPS is also subject to annual audits by the National Assembly, and the NPS's dispositions are reviewable as public law acts.\n\nNational Pension Act, 31 July 2014, Art. 48 (**C-77**).\n\nILC Articles (with commentaries) (2001), Art. 4(2) (**CLA-38**) (\"[a]n organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal of the State.\").\n\nNational Pension Act, 31 July 2014, Art. 26 (**C-77**).  \n*See* ILC Articles (with commentaries) (2001), p. 39 (**CLA-38**) (\"The State as a subject of international law is held responsible for the conduct of all the organs, instrumentalities and officials which form part of its organization and act in that capacity *whether or not they have separate legal personality under its internal law*.\") (Emphasis added.)\n\nEuijeongboo District Court Case No. 2014Guhap9658, 25 August 2015, p. 6 (**C-252**).\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2015Nu59343, 9 March 2016, p. 3 (**C-262**).  \nIn light of the evidence, this would be the Tribunal's finding also under the \"complete dependence\" test applied by the ICJ in Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007, paras. 392-93 (**CLA-24**). The Tribunal however is not persuaded that this is the relevant test in the present context, which does not involve attribution of acts of genocide in the circumstances of an armed conflict. Here, the Tribunal tends to agree with the observations of the tribunal in *Bayindir Insaat Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009, para. 130 (**CLA-26**) (noting that \"the approach developed in such areas of international law [*i.e.* 'foreign armed intervention' or 'criminal responsibility'] is not always adapted to the realities of international economic law and that they should not prevent a finding of attribution if the specific facts of an investment dispute so warrant.\").\n\n445.\n\nIn light of the wealth of evidence before it, linking the NPS to the State both functionally and financially, the Tribunal finds that the NPS is *de facto* a State organ and accordingly its conduct is attributable to the Korean State.657 In so deciding, the Tribunal takes no view on whether the NPS exercises any governmental authority, or *puissance publique,* or whether it exercised such authority when exercising its voting rights on the Merger. This issue, which is also in dispute between the Parties, is one for the merits, as it is irrelevant, for purposes of attribution, whether the relevant conduct of a State organ is to be classified as exercise of governmental authority, or a sovereign act, or as a commercial conduct.658\n\n*See* ILC Articles (with commentaries) (2001), p. 41 (**CLA-38**) (\"It is irrelevant for purposes of attribution [under Article 4 of the ILC Articles] that the conduct of a State organ may be classified as 'commercial' or as *acta iure gestionis*.\").\n\n446.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 11.1.3 of the Treaty does not contain a provision corresponding to Article 8 of the ILC Articles, which provides that \"[t]he conduct of a person or a group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instruction of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out its conduct.\" In view of the findings reached above, regarding the other grounds of attribution, the Tribunal need not address the issue of whether attribution on this basis is also available under the Treaty.\n\n**C. Whether the Claimant has Made Covered \"Investments\" PEursuant to the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nArticle 1.4 of the Treaty defines the term \"covered investment\" as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE 1.4: DEFINITIONS**\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified:\n\n...\n\n**covered investment** means, with respect to a Party, an investment, as defined in Article 11.28 (Definitions), in its territory of an investor of the other Party that is in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter[\u2026]\n\n...\n\n448.\n\nArticle 11.28 of the Treaty defines the term \"investment\" as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE 11.28: DEFINITIONS**\n\nFor the purposes of this Chapter:\n\n...\n\n**investment** means every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.\n\nForms that an investment may take include:\n\n(a) \u2026\n\n(b) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise;\n\n(c) \u2026\n\n(d) futures, options, and other derivatives[\u2026]\n\n...\n\n***1. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n449.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the two interests the Claimant allegedly held in relation to SC&T, namely the shareholding and the total return swaps in SC&T, do not constitute covered investments under Articles 1.4 and 11.28 of the Treaty. Specifically, in respect of the Claimant's SC&T share ownership, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant's purported investment lacks the contribution or the duration required to constitute a covered investment under the Treaty.659\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 369.\n\n**(a) The Claimant's shareholding in SC&T**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n450.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, despite the use of \"or\" in Article 11.28 of the Treaty in listing the exemplary \"characteristics of an investment\" \u2013 namely, \"the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk\" \u2013 the use of the plural form \"characteristics\" confirms that an asset requires more than a single characteristic to warrant Treaty protection.660\n\nRejoinder, paras. 110-11, *citing* Treaty, Art. 11.28 (**C-1**).\n\n451.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the holding in *Seo v. Korea* does not support the Claimant's position, given that the tribunal's test involved \"a global assessment of which characteristics and how strongly they show in the asset in the question \u2026 start[ing] with the three listed characteristics because they were deemed particularly important by the drafters of the [Treaty].\"661 It was after examining all three characteristics of the Treaty that the tribunal determined that it did not qualify as an \"investment.\"662\n\nRejoinder, para. 113, *citing Jin Hae Seo v.

Republic of Korea*, HKIAC Case No. HKIAC/18117, Final Award, 27 September 2019, paras.138-39 (**CLA-138**)\n\n452.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent submits that the global assessment of the Claimant's shareholding in SC&T shows that no protected investment exists under the Treaty because the Claimant has failed to prove that it contributed capital to obtain SC&T shares for a sufficient duration with the expectation of a long-term presence.663\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 357; Rejoinder, para. 109.\n\n453.\n\nRelying on *Seo v. Korea*, the Respondent argues that \"it is relevant how significant the commitment of capital or other resources is\" in determining whether an asset constitutes an \"investment,\" given that the purpose of the Treaty is \"to raise living standards, promote economic growth and stability, create new employment opportunities, and improve general welfare.\"664 Consequently, the Respondent considers that \"commitment of capital\" is one of the most important characteristics that an asset must have to qualify as an \"investment.\"665\n\nRejoinder, para. 124, *referring to Jin Hae Seo v. Republic of Korea*, HKIAC Case No. HKIAC/18117, Final Award, 27 September 2019, para. 104 (**CLA-138**).\n\nRejoinder, para. 124.\n\n454.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, no evidence has been proffered to prove that EALP, as opposed to a different Elliott entity, paid for those additional shares.666 Referring to Mr. Smith's statements that 66% of the swaps were not owned by EALP, but by two other Elliott funds, EILP and Liverpool L.P., the Respondent points out that approximately 4.4 million (*i.e.* 66% of the 6.6 million shares bought with swap proceeds as of 17 July 2015) were bought with funds not belonging to the Claimant.667 Consequently, the Respondent takes the view that the Claimant cannot claim damages for such shares.668\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 359-60, *referring to* DART filing titled \"Report on Stocks, etc. Held in Bulk,\" 4 June 2015, p. 2 (**R-3**).\n\nRejoinder, para. 126, *referring to* Second Smith Statement, paras. 6(iii), 36, 65 (**CWS-5**).\n\nRejoinder, para. 126.\n\n455.\n\nThe Respondent, relying on the holding in *KT Asia v. Kazakhstan*, argues that \"no matter how long the duration is in practice, it must exist with the expectation of some long-term relationship.\"669 Therefore, the Respondent asserts that an investment must be at least intended to last for a sufficient duration to justify it being protected under the Treaty.670 Yet, for the Respondent, there is no evidence that the Claimant intended to maintain its shareholding in SC&T for any extended duration; rather, it \"planned to exit its investment at the soonest possible moment that it could realise what it considered to be a satisfactory profit,\" as shown in EALP's trading plans in November 2014 and March 2015.671\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 365, *citing* *KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v.

The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n464.\n\nThe Claimant submits that both its shareholding in SC&T and the swap contracts referencing SC&T shares display \"the characteristics of an investment\" and qualify as protected investments under the Treaty.687\n\nReply, para. 200, *citing* Treaty, Art. 11.28 (**C-1**).\n\n**(a) The Claimant's shareholding in SC&T**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nThe Claimant denies that the Treaty requires that a protected investment needs to exhibit all of the characteristics listed in Article 11.28 of the Treaty.688 The proper reading of Article 11.28, in the Claimant's view, is to treat the listed characteristics of an investment as disjunctives and consider the list illustrative only, as indicated by the phrase \"including such characteristics as\" and the use of the word \"or.\"689\n\nReply, para. 214.\n\nReply, para. 214, *citing* Treaty, Art. 11.28 (**C-1**); Claimant's PHB, para. 46.\n\n466.\n\nIn support of its contention, the Claimant relies on the holding of the tribunal in *Seo v. Korea* that \"the list is merely illustrative,\"690 and that that \"as the word, 'or' implies, none of [the listed characteristics] is indispensable.\"691 According to the Claimant, its investment in SC&T qualifies for Treaty protection because it exhibits at least two of the listed characteristics: \"the expectation of gain of profit\" and \"the assumption of risk.\"692 In any event, the Claimant posits that its purchase of over KRW 685 billion to acquire 11,125,927 SC&T shares is \"undoubtedly a 'substantial' and 'meaningful' commitment of capital.\"693\n\nReply, para. 215, *citing* L.

Second Smith Statement, para. 66 (**CWS-5**).\n\n467.\n\nThe Claimant qualifies the Respondent's assertion that EALP used the swap proceeds of EILP to purchase some of its SC&T shares as a \"made up\" story, given that Mr. Smith in his witness statements did not discuss the source of funds used for EALP's share purchases in February 2015 and onwards.694 Therefore, according to the Claimant, no necessary correlation exists between EILP exiting swap positions and EALP purchasing shares.695 In this respect, the Claimant also relies on *Gavrilovic v. Croatia* to argue that \"[t]he source of funds is irrelevant for the purposes of determining whether there [is] an 'investment' under the [Treaty].\"696\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 25. *See* Second Smith Statement, para. 36 (**CWS-5**).\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 27.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 31, *citing* *Georg Gavrilovic and Gavrilovic d.o.o. v.

The U.S. Submission***\n----------------------------\n\n479.\n\nThe United States submits that the categories listed under the heading \"[f]orms that an investment may take\" in Article 11.28 of the Treaty are illustrative and non-exhaustive.714 Thus, the enumeration of a type of an asset in Article 11.28 is not dispositive of the question whether a particular asset, owned or controlled by an investor, meets the definition of investment.715 Yet, in order to qualify as \"investment,\" the asset \"must still always possess the characteristics of an investment,\" including \"such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.\"716\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 7.\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 7.\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 7, *citing* Treaty, Art. 11.28 (**C-1**).\n\n***4. The Tribunal's Determination***\n-------------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nThe relevant provisions for purposes of determining whether the Claimant has made a qualifying \"investment\" are Articles 1.4 and 11.28 of the Treaty. Article 1.4 defines the term \"covered investment\" as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE 1.4: DEFINITIONS**\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise specified:\n\n...\n\n**covered investment** means, with respect to a Party, an investment, as defined in Article 11.28 (Definitions), in its territory of an investor of the other Party that is in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter[\u2026]\n\n...\n\n481.\n\nArticle 11.28 of the Treaty, in turn, defines the term \"investment\":\n\n**ARTICLE 11.28: DEFINITIONS**\n\nFor the purposes of this Chapter:\n\n...\n\n**investment** means every asset that an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment, including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.\n\nForms that an investment may take include:\n\n(a) \u2026\n\n(b) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise;\n\n(c) \u2026\n\n(d) futures, options, and other derivatives[\u2026]\n\n...\n\n482.\n\nAs summarized above, the Parties disagree on whether the Claimant made a qualifying investment protected under the Treaty and, accordingly, whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the Claimant's claims. The Tribunal must therefore determine whether the assets that the Claimant allegedly \"invested\" in the Republic of Korea qualify as a protected investment under the Treaty.\n\n483.\n\nAs noted above, the Treaty provides separate definitions for \"investment\" and a \"covered investment.\" It is therefore not sufficient for the Claimant to establish that its alleged investment qualifies as an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 11.28; the alleged \"investment\" must also qualify as a \"covered investment\" under Article 1.4; that is, it must have been made in the territory of the Republic of Korea.\n\n484.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' positions and the supporting evidence, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant's shareholding in SC&T constitutes an investment within the meaning of Articles 11.28 and 1.4. Indeed, shareholding may be considered a quintessential form of investment in the sense that it typically involves a capital contribution, or commitment of capital, in a business venture \u2013 in this case, SC&T \u2013 in the expectation of profit, while also involving assumption of the risk that the share price will not develop, in the future, as expected at the time the investment was made, and indeed that its value may be lost in its entirety if the business venture fails. While Article 11.28 of the Treaty does not specifically require that the commitment of capital should have a certain duration in order to qualify as a protected investment under the Treaty, a shareholding generally meets this requirement as it does not involve a one-off (commercial) transaction such as transactions for purchase and sale of goods or services. This is also, indisputably, the case here. Similarly, in view of the amounts spent by the Claimant in purchasing SC&T's shares \u2013 according to the Claimant, KRW 685 billion717 \u2013 as well as the fact that SC&T is a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Korea, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant's shareholding in SC&T meets the requirements of contribution and territoriality and thus amounts to an \"investment\" in the Republic of Korea, within the meaning of Articles 11.28 and 1.4 of the Treaty.\n\nSee Section VIII below.\n\n485.\n\nAs for the total return swap contracts, the Tribunal notes that the Treaty specifically mentions \"derivatives\" as a form that an investment may take, and that the Respondent does not appear to dispute the Claimant's argument that a swap contract is a form of a derivative. Nevertheless, as summarized above, the Respondent argues in its Statement of Defence that the total return swaps referencing SC&T shares do not possess the inherent characteristics of an investment under Article 11.28 of the Treaty, and also do not meet the requirement of territoriality under Article 1.4 of the Treaty.718 In the Reply, the Claimant stated that, although it was \"wrong\" to argue, as the Respondent did, that swaps do not qualify as protected investments under the Treaty, it \"no longer held any swaps at the date the Measures at issue here culminated in damage to the Claimant, and therefore the Claimant does not seek to found the jurisdiction on its swaps.\"719\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 344-56.\n\nReply, para. 200.\n\n486.\n\nIn view of the Claimant's confirmation that it does not rely on the total return swaps to found the Tribunal's jurisdiction, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to decide on whether the Claimant's swap contracts constitute an investment in the territory of the Republic of Korea under Articles 11.28 and 1.4 of the Treaty.\n\n**D. Whether the Claimant's Claims Constitute an Abuse of Process**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's claims constitute an abuse of process on two grounds: (i) the Claimant purposefully restructured its investment by selling its swaps to buy shares in SC&T so that it could pursue litigation; and (ii) the Claimant is seeking to re-litigate issues already resolved in the Settlement Agreement.720\n\nRejoinder, para. 130.\n\n**(a) Whether the Claimant abusively restructured its investment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nRelying on *Philip Morris v. Australia*, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant \"restructure[d] its investment in such a fashion as to fall within the scope of protection of a treaty in view of a specific foreseeable dispute.\"721 The Respondent argues that the Claimant restructured its investment from one made through swap contracts, which did not attract Treaty protection, to one made through direct shareholding, which could attract Treaty protection, at a time when a dispute was foreseeable.722\n\nRejoinder, para. 132(b), *citing* *Philip Morris Asia Limited v.

Grenada*, the Respondent contends that \"having had one bite at the cherry in claims against [SC&T] (the proper defendant), it is abusive for the Claimant now to try for more against a different respondent (the ROK).\"733\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 381, 385; Rejoinder, para. 147.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 383.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 384, *referring to* *Grynberg and others v.

The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nThe Claimant submits, referring to the judgment of the ICJ in the *Immunities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France) Case*, that \"it is only in exceptional circumstances that the Court should reject a claim based on a valid title to jurisdiction on the ground of abuse of process.\"738 According to the Claimant, the Respondent has not identified any decision \"disapproving or even questioning\" the standard applied by the ICJ.739\n\nReply, para. 386, *citing* *Immunities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v.

Australia*, relied on by the Respondent, requires an examination as to whether Claimant restructured its investment for the sole purpose of gaining the protection of an investment treaty at a point in time when the dispute was already foreseeable.740\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 137.\n\n**(a) Whether the Claimant abusively restructured its investment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n498.\n\nFirst, the Claimant denies that its acquisition of shares amount to a restructuring of its investment, and instead argues that it constituted \"an enlarging of an existing investment.\"741 According to the Claimant, the swap positions it closed in March related only to 1.51% of SC&T shares, whereas the Claimant's ownership of SC&T shares grew from 1.43% in early March 2015 to 4.74% by 20 April 2015.742\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 141.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 140(c). *See* Second Smith Statement, Appendix A (**CWS-5**).\n\n499.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that such expansion of its investment was part of its ordinary economic activity to enhance its ability to defeat the Merger at the EGM as a minority shareholder.743 The Claimant explains that following the \"shock[ing]\" Merger announcement on 26 May 2015, the acquisition of additional shares was a \"prompt[]\" response \"to prepare for what it believed at the time would be a fair proxy fight against the Merger proposal.\"744 Accordingly, as the purchase of additional SC&T shares served a legitimate commercial purpose, there can be no basis to the Respondent's allegation that the Claimant's \"unique goal\" or \"the sole purpose\" for any alleged \"restructuring\" was to gain Treaty protection that it did not already have.745\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 392; Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras. 146, 148.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 148. *See* First Smith Statement, para. 36 (**CWS-1**); Third Witness Statement of James Smith dated 23 December 2020, para. 7(ii) (**CWS-6**).\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 143(a), *citing* *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. the Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, para. 142 (**RLA-45**).\n\n500.\n\nFinally, the Claimant avers that the specific dispute at issue in this arbitration \u2013 the alleged illegal governmental intervention in the Merger vote \u2013 was not foreseeable, let alone conceivable by the Claimant when it purchased the additional SC&T shares.746 The Claimant points out that the specific dispute submitted to the Tribunal in this case does not concern the Merger or the possibility thereof, but rather the Respondent's improper conduct in bringing about the Merger, which was concealed from the Claimant.747\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 151, *citing* *Philip Morris Limited v.

Grenada* is distinguishable.755 Accordingly, the present case, which is based on an international cause of action after settling a \"different claim in relation to a different cause of action against a different [r]espondent,\" is a \"genuine dispute.\"756\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 157.\n\nReply, paras. 403-04, *referring to* *Grynberg and others v.

The Tribunal's Determination***\n-------------------------------------\n\n504.\n\nThe Respondent's raises its abuse of process argument on two grounds: (i) that the Claimant abusively restructured its investment in order to create jurisdiction after the dispute had already arisen; and (ii) that the Claimant has already resolved its claims as a result of the Settlement Agreement concluded with SC&T.\n\n505.\n\nThe former argument is based on the allegation that the Claimant restructured its investment from one made through swap contracts to one based on direct shareholding, beginning on 29 January 2015 when the Merger was already foreseeable, and when the Claimant had already decided to oppose the Merger. The Claimant's subsequent actions in the course of the spring and summer of 2015 allowed it to position itself to interfere with the Merger and, if necessary, to litigate to defend its position.\n\n506.\n\nThe Respondent's argument fails on the facts. The present dispute does not arise out of the dispute between the Claimant and SC&T, or the Claimant's failure to block the Merger; it arises out of the Respondent's alleged interference with NPS's vote regarding the Merger. There was no information in the public domain, even in the form of rumors, at the relevant time that the Respondent would be taking any action, or was in fact taking any action, to interfere with that vote.757 According to the Claimant, information about the Respondent's potential interference with the Merger vote began to circulate in the public domain only towards the end of 2016, over a year after the Merger, which took place on 17 July 2015. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that such information was available in the public domain, even in the form of rumors, at any earlier time, let alone in the spring or summer of 2015. The Claimant subsequently commenced this arbitration on 13 April 2018, alleging government interference in the Merger vote.\n\nWhile the Spectrum Asia Report on SC&T and Cheil (**R-255**, p. 24) did state that the NPS was \"unlikely to pose a threat to the merger process,\" and noted that \"[t]raditionally, NPS has also been protecting Samsung from hostile takeover attempts by any other large shareholder within the company,\" this is a reference to what the NPS might do, rather than what the Korean Government might do.\n\n507.\n\nThe Respondent's second abuse of process argument is based on the allegation that the Claimant has already resolved its claims as a result of the Settlement Agreement it concluded in March 2016 with SC&T, following litigation before Korean courts. The Respondent's argument fails for the same reason as its first abuse of process argument. The present dispute is not one between the Claimant and SC&T arising out of the price re-appraisal of the Claimant's buy-back shares; it arises out of the Republic of Korea's alleged interference with the Merger vote, and thus is distinguishable from the Settlement Agreement in terms of both the counterparty and the subject matter of the dispute. As pointed out by the Claimant, the Settlement Agreement is relevant to the present dispute only to the extent that the Tribunal finds against the Respondent on the merits. In such a case, the Tribunal would have to deduct any amounts the Claimant has received from SC&T in respect of the buy-back shares. According to the Claimant, it has taken these amounts into account when quantifying its claims.\n\n508.\n\nThe Respondent's abuse of process argument is thus unfounded and must be dismissed.\n\n509.\n\nIn view of the findings reached above, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to address any of the legal arguments raised by the Parties in connection with the Claimant's alleged abuse of process.\n\n**VI. MERITS**\n--------------\n\n510.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's conduct in connection with the Merger constitutes breaches of Articles 11.5 and 11.3 of the Treaty. This is disputed by the Respondent. The Parties also disagree as to whether the Claimant knowingly assumed the risk of approval of the Merger in making its investments, and whether such assumption of risk can be relied upon as a defense to the alleged breaches of the Treaty by the Respondent.\n\n511.\n\nThe Tribunal will address each of these issues below in turn.\n\n**A. Minimum Standard of Treatment**\n------------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nArticle 11.5 of the Treaty provides, in relevant part:\n\n**ARTICLE 11.5: MINIMUM STANDARD OF TREATMENT**\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide:\n\n(a) \"fair and equitable treatment\" includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and\n\n(b) \"full protection and security\" requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.\n\n513.\n\nAnnex 11-A of the Treaty further provides:\n\nCustomary International Law. The Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law\" generally \u2026 results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 11.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.\n\n***1. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) The applicable standard under Article 11.5 of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n514.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent's conduct in connection with the Merger constitutes a breach of the international minimum standard of treatment (\"**MST**\") obligation under Article 11.5 of the Treaty, which \"includes and incorporates\" the obligation to accord investors \"fair and equitable treatment.\"758\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 217-20.\n\n515.\n\nThe Claimant relies in support of its position, *inter alia*, on *Waste Management.759* According to the Claimant, the *Waste Management* tribunal, relying on *S.D. Myers*, *Mondev*, *ADF,* and *Loewen*, held that the MST is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant that is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety. This standard would be breached in the event of a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process.760\n\n*Waste Management Inc v.

A formulation of a purported rule of customary international law based entirely on arbitral awards that lack an examination of State practice and *opinio juris* fails to establish a rule of customary international law as incorporated by Article 11.5.1.\"873\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 20.\n\n***4. The Tribunal's Determination***\n-------------------------------------\n\n565.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the content of the applicable legal standard under the Treaty, which is largely agreed by the Parties, and then whether the Claimant has proven, on the facts, that the Respondent has breached that standard.\n\n**(a) The Content of the Minimum Standard of Treatment under the Treaty**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n566.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the Treaty for the purposes of the MST obligation are Article 11.5 and Annex 11-A of the Treaty. Article 11.5 provides, in relevant part:\n\n**Article 11.5: MINIMUM STANDARD OF TREATMENT**\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide:\n\n(a) \"fair and equitable treatment\" includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and\n\n(b) \"full protection and security\" requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.\n\n3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.\n\n567.\n\nFootnote 1 to Article 11.5 states that \"Article 11.5 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 11-A.\" Annex 11-A (\"Customary International Law\") in turn provides:\n\nThe Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law\" generally and as specifically referenced in Article 15.5 and Annex 11-B results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 11.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.\n\n568.\n\nArticle 11.5 thus makes clear that the applicable standard is that of customary international law rather than an autonomous standard of fairness and equity established by the Treaty, and that the terms \"fair and equitable treatment\" in the provision do not add to the customary international law standard and \"do not create additional substantive rights.\" Similarly, \"full protection and security\" requires each Party to provide \"the level of police protection required under customary international law.\" The Tribunal must thus interpret the terms \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" in the context of, and as an element of, the MST obligation, while giving meaning to such terms in accordance with the general rule of treaty interpretation as set out in the VCLT, which requires that a treaty be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" Moreover, while applying Article 11.5, the Tribunal must take into account the State parties' shared understanding of customary international law, as stated in Annex 11-A of the Treaty.\n\n569.\n\nIt follows from the language of Article 11.5(1) and (2) of the Treaty, when interpreted in accordance with Annex 11-A, that in order to establish a breach of the MST, the claimant must demonstrate that the act or omission of the respondent State of which it complains (i) constitutes a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure of customary international law governing treatment of aliens; or (ii) is incompatible with a substantive rule (or norm) of customary international law governing the treatment of aliens. These two standards of conduct are reflected in the language of Article 11.5(2)(a), which confirms that (i) the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment \"includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world,\" which is a procedural standard of conduct; and that (ii) the obligation to provide \"full protection and security\" requires each Party to \"provide the level of police protection required under customary international law,\" which is a substantive standard of conduct.\n\n570.\n\nIt also follows from the language of Article 11.5(1) and (2) of the Treaty, when interpreted in accordance with Annex 11-A, that it is the Claimant, as the moving party, that bears the burden of proving, to the Tribunal's satisfaction, that the Respondent's alleged conduct amounts to a breach of the MST obligation, either because it is in breach of a fundamental rule of procedure of customary international law or because it is incompatible with a substantive rule of customary international law governing fair and equitable treatment or full protection and security. To the extent that the Claimant bases its claim on an alleged rule of procedure or a substantive rule of customary international law that has not been specifically endorsed by the State Parties as such in the Treaty itself, or found to qualify as such by international courts or tribunals in decisions that are generally accepted as reflective of customary international law, the Claimant bears the burden of showing that the alleged rule or norm \"results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation,\" in accordance with Annex 11-A of the Treaty.\n\n571.\n\nAs noted above, the Parties agree that the content of the MST obligation was authoritatively described in the *Waste Management II* award. In that case, the tribunal reflected on the \"general standard\" of the MST obligation in the following terms:\n\nThe search here is for the Article 1105 standard of review, and it is not necessary to consider the specific results reached in the cases discussed above. Taken together, the S.D. Myers, Mondev, ADF and Loewen cases suggest that the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety \u2013 as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.874\n\n*Waste Management Inc v. United Mexican States (II)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, para. 98 (**CLA-16**).\n\n572.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the MST obligation, as characterized by the *Waste Management II* tribunal, includes references to standards of conduct that are primarily or exclusively substantive (*e.g.*, \"arbitrary,\" \"unjust,\" \"idiosyncratic,\" \"discriminatory\") or primarily or exclusively procedural (*e.g.*, \"unfair,\" \"lack of due process\"), as well as to the required degree of severity of the conduct departing from those standards *(e.g.*, \"*grossly* unfair,\" \"lack of due process leading to an *outcome which offends judicial propriety*,\" \"*manifest* failure of natural justice,\" \"*complete* lack of transparency and candour\").\n\n573.\n\nThe *Waste Management II* award was not based on the Treaty, but on Article 1105 of NAFTA. Nevertheless, although the wordings of Article 11.5 of the Treaty and Article 1105 of NAFTA are not identical, they are similar, in particular when Article 1105 of NAFTA is considered in light of its interpretation by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission. Both provisions require a State party to accord to the investments of an investor of another State party treatment in accordance with international law, \"including fair and equitable treatment.\" While Article 11.5 of the Treaty further specifies that the reference is to \"customary international law\" (and not only to \"international law\"), the Note of Interpretation of the NAFTA Free Trade Commission made clear that Article 1105 of NAFTA also referred to customary international law, and that \"[t]he concepts of 'fair and equitable treatment' and 'full protection of security' do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\" As noted above, Article 11.5 of the Treaty similarly specifies that \"[t]he concepts of 'fair and equitable treatment' and 'full protection and security' do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard [*i.e.* the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens], and do not create additional substantive rights.\" In contrast with Article 1105 of NAFTA, as interpreted by the Free Trade Commission, Article 11.5 of the Treaty goes on to specify that the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment \"includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world.\" Finally, in contrast with the NAFTA, as interpreted by the Free Trade Commission, footnote 1 to Article 11.5 of the Treaty specifies that the article \"shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 11-A.\" In that annex, the Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"'customary international law' generally and as specifically referenced in Annex 11-A \u2026 results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation,\" and that the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to \"all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.\"\n\n574.\n\nOther NAFTA tribunals have also reflected on the content of the MST obligation as established in customary international law, including the *Cargill* tribunal, to which both Parties make a specific reference. Noting that \"Article 1105 [of NAFTA] requires no more, no less, than the minimum standard of treatment demanded by customary international law,\" the *Cargill* tribunal went on to find that the customary international law standard was \"at least that set forth in the 1926 *Neer* arbitration,\" and that all State Parties to NAFTA agreed with that position:\n\nIn the case of customary international law standard of \"fair and equitable treatment,\" the Parties in this case and the other two NAFTA State Parties agree that the customary international law standard is at least that set forth in the 1926 *Neer* arbitration \u2026 The Parties and the other two NAFTA State Parties also agree that the standard may evolve and, indeed, may have evolved since 1926.875\n\n*Cargill, Incorporated v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2, Award, 18 September 2009, para. 272 (**CLA-2**).\n\n575.\n\nThe *Neer* decision, which was issued by the U.S.-Mexico General Claims Commission, described the applicable customary international law standard in the following terms:\n\n4. \u2026 Without attempting to announce a precise formula, it is in the opinion of the Commission possible to go a little further than the authors quoted, and to hold (first) that the propriety of governmental acts should be put to the test of international standards, and (second) that the treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency. Whether the insufficiency proceeds from deficient execution of an intelligent law or from the fact that the laws of the country do not empower the authorities to measure up to international standards is immaterial \u2026.\n\n5. It is not for an international tribunal such as this Commission to decide, whether another course of procedure taken by the local authorities at Guanacevi might have been more effective. On the contrary, the grounds of liability limit its inquiry to whether there is convincing evidence either (1) that the authorities administering the Mexican law acted in an outrageous way, in bad faith, in wilful neglect of their duties, or in a pronounced degree of improper action, or (2) that Mexican law rendered it impossible for them properly to fulfill their task.876\n\n*Neer and Neer (U.S.) v. United Mexican States*, General Claims Commission (Mexico and United States), Decision, 15 October 1926, pp. 61-62 (**CLA-12**).\n\n576.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that judicial and arbitral pronouncements such as those in *Neer* must be considered with due care. First, in contrast with *Neer*, which arose out of an alleged \"failure to apprehend or punish,\" the present case deals with the protection of foreign investment.877 Accordingly, leaving aside the question whether the standard articulated in *Neer* has evolved in the almost one hundred years that have elapsed since it was adopted (an issue that the Tribunal need not address, in view of its findings below), the Tribunal notes that the Treaty envisages and indeed specifically confirms that the MST standard applies not only in circumstances such as those in *Neer*, but also to treatment of foreign investment, and requires \"fair and equitable treatment\" of covered investments. Second, and in any event, judicial and arbitral pronouncements regarding the content of customary international law cannot substitute for the Tribunal's exercise of its own judgment in determining whether the Respondent's conduct, in light of the facts as established by the Tribunal on the basis of the evidence before it, amounts to a breach of Article 11.5 of the Treaty. As the *Mondev* tribunal put it, when considering the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article 1105 of NAFTA:\n\nWhen a tribunal is faced with the claim by a foreign investor that the investment has been unfairly or inequitably treated or not accorded full protection and security, it is bound to pass upon that claim on the facts and by application of any governing treaty provision. A judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case. It is part of the essential business of courts and tribunals to make judgments such as these. In doing so, the general principles referred to in Article 1104(1) and similar provisions must inevitably be interpreted and applied to the particular facts.878\n\n*Neer and Neer (U.S.) v. United Mexican States*, General Claims Commission (Mexico and United States), Decision, 15 October 1926, p. 60 (**CLA-12**).\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, para. 118 (**CLA-11**).\n\n577.\n\nThis observation applies to the determination of whether the MST obligation in Article 11.5 of the Treaty has been breached in this particular case.\n\n578.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore now turns to the relevant facts of this case, as summarized above in Section III.\n\n**(b) Whether the Respondent breached the Minimum Standard of Treatment obligation under the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nThe Claimant's case is that the Respondent's breached its MST obligation under the Treaty by a series of actions that commenced on 24 June 2015 and culminated, on 10 July 2015, in the vote of the Investment Committee of the NPS to support the Merger. According to the Claimant, the NPS reached its decision in favor of the Merger on the basis of a Merger Ratio that significantly undervalued the SC&T stock and by fabricating a synergy effect to offset the losses that the NPS was aware it would suffer on the Merger from the perspective of its being a shareholder in SC&T. (The Merger Ratio would, conversely, benefit the NPS as a shareholder in Cheil, but the evidence is that that benefit would not outweigh the loss occasioned to its SC&T shareholding.) The Claimant contends that the Respondent's conduct therefore was irrational, involved willful disregard of due process, and was the result of a gross illegality.\n\n580.\n\nAs summarized above, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proving that the alleged conduct of ROK officials and the NPS breached the MST obligation, because, among other reasons, that conduct did not reach the threshold of seriousness sufficient to establish a treaty breach. According to the Respondent, the NPS's decision-making process did not involve manifest arbitrariness or a manifest lack of reasons, was not made in willful disregard of due process, and indeed the Korean courts have not found that the NPS's decision-making process in connection with the Merger violated any applicable regulation. Moreover, according to the Respondent, EALP was not the only foreign investor whose shares in SC&T were allegedly devalued by the Merger; the investments of other foreign and domestic investors in SC&T, including the NPS itself, were affected in the same way. The Respondent also contends that the vote on the Merger did not involve exercise of sovereign authority, or *puissance publique*, and accordingly cannot establish State responsibility under international law.\n\n581.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the starting point in determining whether, on the facts, the Respondent's conduct can be said to amount to a breach of its MST obligation under the Treaty is the decisions of the local Korean courts dealing with the criminal proceedings arising out of the NPS's approval of the Merger. The essential facts underlying these decisions are not in dispute between the Parties.879 When considering the evidentiary value of these decisions, the Tribunal notes that, while a breach of domestic law, including a criminal act established under domestic law, does not necessarily amount to a breach of an international obligation, it may constitute evidence of facts establishing such breach. If such evidence is available, and the evidence is relevant and material, the Tribunal must determine whether the Respondent's conduct amounts to a breach of Article 11.5 of the Treaty, applying the standards and the methodology outlined above. The Parties agree that the applicable standard of proof in making this determination is balance of probabilities, and not one applicable in criminal proceedings, which the Parties agree is, in the Republic of Korea, proof beyond a reasonable doubt.880\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 16:17-19.\n\n*See* Reply, n. 1501, *referring to* *Glencore International A.G. and C.I.

At the time, Elliott Associates, L.P. (\"Elliott\"), an international fund which had amassed a 7.12% stake in SC&T, vehemently opposed the Merger in the interests of the SC&T shareholders. As Elliott opposed the Merger, the NPS held a casting vote.885\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 4 (**C-69**).\n\n586.\n\nThe Court noted that Minister Moon, in his capacity as Minister of Health and Welfare, directed and supervised the NPS. The Court found that, at a time when the NPS's vote on the Merger was discussed, Minister Moon \"exert[ed] pressure on the Investment Management,\" which amounted to \"unlawful uses of his general powers as a public official.\"886 According to the Court, Minister Moon provided \"detailed instructions to intervene\" in the NPS's vote \"that should be independently decided by the NPS through its voting process.\"887 More specifically, the Court found as follows:\n\nAt the end of June 2015, [Minister Moon] expressed to [Mr. Jo] that he would \"like to see the Samsung merger approved\" \u2026 On June 30, 2015, per [Minister Moon], [Mr. Jo], among others, visited the Investment Management office \u2026 and instructed [CIO Hong] of NPS and other Investment Management employees to \"have the Investment Committee decide on the SC&T / Cheil merger,\" with the underlying directive to have the Investment Committee vote in favor of the Merger and added, \"Even a little child would know the answer, but do not say that the Ministry of Health and Welfare was involved.\"888\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 59 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 5 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 7 (**C-69**).\n\n587.\n\nAs it became evident that a referral of the matter to the Experts Voting Committee, which had decided on the earlier SK/SK C&C merger, would not \"guarantee\" the approval of the Merger, in the morning of 8 July 2015, Minister Moon \"instructed [Mr. Nam-kwon Jo] to have the Merger motion reviewed by the Investment Committee instead of Experts Voting Committee.\"889 CIO Hong subsequently instructed to \"fabricate a synergy effect to offset the expected loss in case of the Merger to serve as a justification for the Merger approval.\"890 Ignoring the Experts Voting Committee's request to refer the matter to them, CIO Hong \"convened and convinced the Investment Committee to vote in favor of the Merger motion based on the fabricated figures.\"891\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 8 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 9 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 9 (**C-69**).\n\n588.\n\nOn 30 June 2015, CIO Hong met with Mr. Nam-kwon Jo, Director of Pension Policy Bureau of the MHW, to discuss the Merger. Mr. Jo told CIO Hong that \"the Merger must be decided on by the Investment Committee.\"892 Mr. Jo reiterated the instruction at a subsequent meeting with CIO Hong held on 8 July 2015 at the MHW, stressing that \"the voting right must be exercised in favor of the Merger. That is what [Minister Moon] wants.\"893 Pursuant to Mr. Jo's instruction, CIO Hong subsequently \"exert[ed] pressure in favor of the Merger by conferring the voting right to the Investment Committee as opposed to the Experts Voting Committee and by exerting pressure on the Investment Committee employees who were under his supervision to agree on the Merger in the Investment Committee meeting.\"894\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 13 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 13 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 14-15 **(C-69**).\n\n589.\n\nOn 9 July 2015, Mr. [REDACTED] reported to CIO Hong that \"if the Merger goes through with Samsung's merger ratio of 1 (Cheil) : 0.35 (SC&T), \u2026 the Merger would cause a loss of at least 138.8 billion won to the NPS.\"895 As noted above, when hearing this report, CIO Hong ordered Mr. [REDACTED] \"to fabricate a merger synergy effect that was needed to offset the expected 138.8 billion won of damages in order to justify the NPS's support for the Merger.\"896 On the same day, Mr. [REDACTED] instructed a member of his research team to create the required synergy effect of 2 trillion won, to offset the expected loss of the same amount. The report, which was prepared \"in a single day,\" confirmed the required synergy effect, even if there were \"no facts to substantiate [the] assumptions.\"897 CIO Hong subsequently ordered Mr. [REDACTED] to attend the Investment Committee meeting to brief the members of the Committee on the fabricated synergy effect.\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 15 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 15 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 15 (**C-69**).\n\n590.\n\nOn 10 July 2015, the NPS exercised its voting rights in favor of the Merger, and thus played \"a vital role\" in the approval of the Merger.898\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 7 (**C-69**).\n\n591.\n\nThe Court found that, throughout the process, CIO Hong, who chaired the Investment Committee, \"actively induced the members of the Investment Committee to vote in favor of the Merger by delegating [Mr. [REDACTED] who attended the meeting, to explain to the members that 'the expected losses to NPS due to Samsung's merger ratio will be offset by the synergy profit of 2.1 trillion won.'\"899 CIO Hong also approached the members of the Investment Committee individually, stating to at least some of them that if the Merger failed, \"the public will accuse us of selling out national wealth to foreign investor[s] just as [Wan-yong Lee].\"900 On this basis, the Court found that CIO Hong \"violated his occupational duty by causing a loss of unknown value to the NPS.\"901\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 17 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 17 (**C-69**).

Despite being an expert in the field of pension, the Defendant put pressure on the NPS through the Ministry officials, thereby seriously infringing the independence of the Investment Management, and damaging [the] NPS' shareholder value. The culpability of such action is substantial.905\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 65-66 (**C-69**).\n\n595.\n\nSimilarly, the Court found that CIO Hong, in his capacity as Chief Investment Officer of the NPS, was \"entrusted with the administration and management of the NPS\" and \"was required to make decisions under a fiduciary duty and in accordance with the said Management Guidelines and the Guidelines for the Exercise of Voting Rights.\"906 The Court went on to state:\n\nIn regards to the Merger, the NPS had a de facto casting vote as the largest shareholder of SC&T; [t]he Merger ratio was such that major shareholders of the Samsung Group such as [JY Lee] would be at a gain, and SC&T shareholders would be at a loss; [t]he Ministry was exerting pressure to consummate the Merger. As such the Defendant had an obligation to act under an even stricter fiduciary duty under the circumstances. This means that the Defendant should not let the Investment Management exercise their voting rights unless the Merger clearly meets the conditions to cast a favorable vote, under Article 6 of the Guidelines for the Exercise of Voting Rights (the exercise shall not reduce shareholder value nor be against the interests of the Fund).907\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 61 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 61-62 **(C-69**).\n\n596.\n\nIn light of its findings, the Court determined that CIO Hong had breached his official duties:\n\nBased on the facts and findings recognized above, it can be inferred that the Defendant, through [Mr. [REDACTED] actions, manipulated the synergy effect and explained the same at the Investment Committee of the Investment Management, and encouraged certain members to approve the Merger before and during the meeting, thereby ultimately causing the Committee to decide in favor of the Merger. Such action goes against the Defendant's occupational duty. Even assuming that the Defendant had considered the overall portfolio of the Fund, or the possibility of a collapse in the share price if the Merger were to be nullified, he had clearly understood the merger ratio to be unfavorable to SC&T shareholders, and thus that the shareholder value for NPS could have dropped upon consummation of the Merger. Therefore the Defendant's breach of its [*sic*] official duties can be easily established.908\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 62-63 **(C-69**).\n\n597.\n\nThe Court concluded and determined that CIO Hong \"ignored [the] principles of investment management and used various unlawful means to induce a favorable decision that run against the interests of the Fund.\"909 Accordingly, as a result,\n\n\u2026 the NPS suffered losses, such as no longer having the casting vote for the Merger, and suffering a decrease in share value. As such, the culpability of the Defendant's acts and the results arising from such acts, is significant.910\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 66 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 67 (**C-69**)\n\n598.\n\nThe Court relied on the following evidence and \"recognized facts\" in support of its conclusions regarding the conduct of Minister Moon and CIO Hong:\n\n\u2022 The guidelines governing the exercise of NPS's voting rights provide that matters that do not bring out a reduction in shareholder value and do \"not go against the profits of the [F]und\" are to be voted for, and matters that bring about a reduction in shareholder value or go against the Fund's profits are to be voted against;911\n\n\u2022 According to the policies set by the NPS for the Merger, the voting rights were to be exercised by the Experts Voting Committee;912\n\n\u2022 Towards the end of June 2015, when \"this [M]erger \"became a big issue because of Elliott,\" Minister Moon instructed [Nam-kwon Jo, Director General of Pension Policy at the MHW] that the Merger \"must be voted in favor;\"913\n\n\u2022 On 30 June 2015, Mr. Jo visited the NPS with another official of the MHW and instructed CIO Hong and other officials of the NPS that the Investment Committee should decide on the Merger. When CIO Hong asked whether they could say that this was done \"under the pressure\" of the MHW, Mr. Jo replied that \"even a little child knows that, but you may not state that the [MHW] is involved in this.\" The compliance officer of the NPS testified that the MHW had never previously discussed procedural matters with the NPS, and that he \"perceived this as a pressure;\"914\n\n\u2022 After further investigations into whether the matter could be decided favorably by the Experts Voting Committee, Minister Moon on 8 July 2015 instructed the NPS to \"search for a solution to have this merger case decided by the fund management headquarters Investment Committee.\" On the same day, in a separate meeting at the MHW, Mr. Jo \"firmly told\" CIO Hong that \"it is [the Minister's] intention to handle this through the Investment Committee;\"915\n\n\u2022 A member of the NPS staff who was not familiar with either SC&C or Cheil was instructed by [Mr. [REDACTED] after discussion with CIO Hong, to calculate a synergy effect of the Merger, in the amount of approximately KRW 4.1 trillion, to offset the loss following from the Merger, \"without verifying whether a synergy was feasible;\"916\n\n\u2022 A number of the Investment Committee members testified that they would likely have voted against the Merger had they known that the synergy effect was fabricated;917\n\n\u2022 CIO Hong said to one of the members of the Investment Committee during a break that \"[i]f the merger falls apart the hedge fund will denounce to me to the [Wan-yong Lee] that sold out on the national wealth. I hope you'll make a good decision.\" CIO Hong also spoke with a number of other members of the Investment Committee, both before and during the meeting;918 and\n\n\u2022 In the evening of 10 July 2015, after the Investment Committee had voted favorably in support of the Merger, CIO Hong reported the results to the NPS, the MHW, and the Blue House.919\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 43 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 43-44 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 44*.* (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 44-45 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 47 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 53 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 54 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 55-56 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 57 (**C-69**).\n\n599.\n\nOn appeal, the Seoul High Court in its judgment of 14 November 2017 substantially upheld the judgment of the Seoul Central District Court. In its \"Reasons for Sentencing,\" the High Court ruled, in relation to Minister Moon, as follows:\n\nBecause the National Pension Fund is a reserve fund to support pension payments, it must be managed/operated so that it maintains its stability by adhering to the principles of profitability, stability, public benefit and liquidity. As such, the Fund must not be used to serve as a tool to achieve certain policy goals or promote political agenda or serve certain interest groups, in a way contrary to the interests of the pensioner. In short, it should not serve certain interest groups or serve as a channel for policy goals or political objectives.\n\n...\n\nRegarding this matter, [Minister Moon], who is responsible for the management/operation of the National Pension Fund as [Minister of Health and Welfare], abused his authority in directing and/or monitoring [the NPS] by making [CIO Hong], through the Ministry of Health and Welfare officials, induce votes in favor of the Merger, thereby making him perform actions contrary to his official duties.920\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, 14 November 2017, p. 71 (**C-79/R-153**).\n\n600.\n\nIn relation to CIO Hong, the High Court ruled as follows:\n\nRegarding this matter, the Court finds [CIO Hong], as [CIO] of the [NPS] as well as [the chair] of the Investment Committee, had the duty to conduct the Investment Committee meeting in a fair and transparent manner and provide factually accurate information so that the Investment Committee members could make independent and autonomous decisions without undue influence from the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Albeit this duty, [CIO Hong] advised several Investment Committee members to vote in favor of the Merger, and had fabricated synergy effect explained in order to induce votes in favor of the Merger. As such, [CIO Hong] breached his duty, thereby allowing Samsung Group majority shareholders to obtain unquantifiable profit, including to [JY Lee] while causing unquantifiable losses in potential profit that may have been attained with an active use of [the NPS's] casting vote, and as such, the nature of crime is depraved. Moreover, [CIO Hong] exerted unlawful undue influence over the exercise of voting rights attached to the shares of certain entities which [the NPS] owns, with the motive to consummate the Merger of certain entities, thereby undermining the function of institutional devices established to ensure independence in the operation of [the NPS] and causing loss to [the NPS]. Further, [CIO Hong] weakened the pillars of [the NPS] by damaging the ROK citizens' trust in the National Pension Fund's professional and autonomous management/operation. Taking factors such as the above into consideration, [CIO Hong] must be punished accordingly.921\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, 14 November 2017, p. 72 (**C-79/R-153**).\n\n601.\n\nThe judgment of the Seoul High Court was appealed to the Supreme Court. On 14 April 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed the Moon/Hong appeal and upheld the findings of the Seoul High Court.922\n\nSupreme Court Case No. 2017Do19635, 14 April 2022 (**C-781**).\n\n602.\n\nThe factual findings of the Seoul Central District Court and the Seoul High Court, and the key supporting evidence relied upon by the Courts, therefore establish that:\n\n(a) The Respondent, through the MHW, intervened in the NPS's vote on the Merger and instructed the NPS to ensure that the vote would be in favor of the Merger; and\n\n(b) The NPS, under the direction and instructions of the MHW, took steps to ensure that the vote would be conducted by the Investment Committee rather than the Experts Voting Committee, influenced the vote conducted by the Investment Committee, including by fabricating a synergy effect of the Merger that had no basis in fact and meeting with members of the Investment Committee, to the effect that the Investment Committee voted in favor of the Merger.\n\n603.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both the Seoul Central District Court and the Seoul High Court reached their conclusions regarding the conduct of Minister Moon and CIO Hong by applying the criminal standard of proof, which the Parties agree is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.923 The Seoul Central District Court further characterized in its judgment the culpability of Minister Moon and CIO Hong as \"substantial\" and \"significant,\" respectively, as a matter of Korean criminal law.924 In light of these findings of the Korean courts, and the Tribunal's finding in Section V.B above that the conduct of the NPS, and thus also that of CIO Hong, is attributable to the Respondent, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent's conduct in connection with the Merger was \"unjust\" and amounted to a \"willful neglect of \u2026 duties\" and \"a pronounced degree of improper action.\"925 As such, it was incompatible with a rule of customary international law prohibiting such conduct that forms part of the minimum standard of treatment of aliens and therefore amounts, *prima facie*, to a breach of the Respondent's MST obligation under Article 11.5 of the Treaty.\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 108; Respondent's PHB, para. 43.\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 66-67 (**C-69**).\n\n*See* *Waste Management Inc v. United Mexican States (II)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, para. 98 (**CLA-16**); *Neer and Neer (U.S.) v. United Mexican States*, General Claims Commission (Mexico and United States), Decision, 15 October 1926, pp. 61-62 (**CLA-12**).\n\n604.\n\nThe Tribunal's finding is not affected by the fact that the Republic of Korea has taken vigorous action to investigate the intervention to the Merger and to punish the wrongdoers in accordance with its criminal justice system. While the action taken by the Korean State in this regard is commendable and demonstrates its commitment to the rule of law, it does not provide any relief to the Claimant for the breach of its rights under the Treaty, which is the subject matter of the present arbitration.\n\n605.\n\nIn an effort to challenge the relevance of the judgments of the Seoul Central District Court and Seoul High Court in the Moon/Hong criminal proceedings, the Respondent relies, in particular, on the judgment of the Seoul Central District Court in connection with proceedings commenced by Ilsung Pharmaceutical and several minority shareholders of SC&T for the annulment of the Merger \u2013 referred to above as the \"Merger Annulment\" case.926 Indeed, the Merger Annulment judgment appears to contradict, in part, the Moon/Hong judgments.\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017 (**R-20**).\n\n606.\n\nIn the Merger Annulment proceedings, the plaintiffs claimed, *inter alia*, that (i) the purpose of the Merger was \"improper\" as it was to ensure that JY Lee and his family succeeded in securing control over the Samsung group; (ii) the Merger Ratio was \"manifestly unfair\" as it favored the shareholders of Cheil over those of SC&T; and (iii) the NPS unlawfully interfered with the establishment of the Merger Ratio and exercised its voting rights unlawfully as it approved the Merger under the instructions of the President and the Minister of Health and Welfare.927 In its judgment, issued on 19 October 2017 (*i.e.* after the judgment of the same court in the Moon/Hong criminal proceedings), the Seoul Central District Court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims. The Court stressed, at the outset, that it should adopt a strict approach to invalidating a merger, \"considering the collective legal nature of the merger and the instability of the legal relationship due to the invalidation of the merger.\"928 On this basis, the Court found, *inter alia*, that the plaintiffs had not produced evidence to demonstrate that the Merger Ratio was manifestly unfair, and also dismissed the claim that the NPS had exercised its voting rights unlawfully on the basis that there was no evidence that Mr. [REDACTED], the chairman of the board of directors of the NPS, was aware of the intervention of the Minister of Health and Welfare and CIO Hong in the NPS's decision-making process. The Court appears to have based its finding on the principle that a company's intent should be equated with that of its CEO and accordingly, since the NPS was represented at the time of the Merger by Mr. [REDACTED], who was not aware of any illegality, the NPS could not be considered to have acted illegally when voting in favor of the Merger:\n\n[P]ursuant to Article 59(2), Article 116(1) of Cheilvil [*sic*] Act, the determination of defective declaration should be considered by referencing the CEO's perception. Therefore, it is not reasonable to transfer internal organizational risks such as professional malpractice and defect of individual employee's declaration of intent to an outsider, and any disadvantages or damages arising from this should be dealt by the internal legal relation between the corporation and its members. As to this case, \u2026 it can be acknowledged that the NPS is represented by its chairman, and [REDACTED], who was the chairman of the board of directors at the time when the Merger agenda was passed, \u2026 and there is no evidence to suggest that [REDACTED] knew of the intervention by the Ministry of Health and Welfare or the director of the Investment Management Division during the time when he was preparing to decide for or against the Merger at NPS. Therefore, NPS's decision to pass the Merger agenda at the Shareholders' Meeting can be said to have no defects, regardless of the existence of defect in the internal decision making process.929\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, p. 5 (**R-20**)\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, p. 6 (**R-20**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, pp. 35-36 (**R-20**).\n\n607.\n\nThe Court concluded that there was \"insufficient evidence to suggest that the Investment Committee's decision in favor of the Merger itself involved an element of breach of trust such as [to cause] large amounts of loss in investment or damage to the value of the shareholders,\"930 and that therefore \"the exercise of voting rights by NPS at the Shareholders' Meeting cannot be considered as illegal so plaintiff's claim which alleges illegality of the resolution as a prerequisite for their argument does not have grounds.\"931 The Tribunal understands that the Court's judgment in the Merger Annulment Proceedings is now final.932\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, p. 37 (**R-20**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, p. 40 (**R-20**).\n\nRespondent's Reply PHB, para. 19, *referring to* Seoul High Court Case No. 2017Na206657, 2 May 2022 (**R-388**).\n\n608.\n\nThe Parties disagree on how the findings of the Seoul Central District Court in the Merger Annulment Proceedings should be read in light of the findings of fact made by the same court, and those of the Seoul High Court, in the Moon/Hong case. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should respect the Korean courts' \"affirmative factual findings unless the Tribunal has, before it, evidence that it could weigh \u2013 including against the courts' findings \u2013 to reach its own factual conclusions on a balance of probabilities\"933 According to the Respondent, this is the case\n\nparticularly where the courts have made conflicting findings. For example, the Korean courts have not consistently found that the NPS's sales synergy calculations and alleged pressure applied by CIO Hong affected the Investment Committee's decision. The Seoul Central District Court, when considering the application to annul the Merger (i.e., Merger Annulment Proceeding), found that they did not.934\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 45; Respondent's Reply PHB, para. 19.\n\nRespondent's Reply PHB, para. 19, *referring to* Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, p. 45 (**R-20**).\n\n609.\n\nThe Respondent further argues, relying on the Seoul Central District Court's judgment in the Merger Annulment Proceedings, that \"[t]he Court confirmed that the Investment Committee members exercised independent judgment in considering the \u2026 factors when each of them decided how they would vote on the Merger agenda item.\"935\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 58(c), *referring to* Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, pp. 41-46 (**R-20**).\n\n610.\n\nThe Claimant asserts, in response, that the Respondent \"overstates the court's findings,\" and that its argument \"amounts to gross mischaracterization when considered against the fact that most if not all of the illegal conduct at issue had not been exposed, let alone considered, at the time of the decision in 2017.\"936 The Claimant notes that \"[t]he court said no more than that '[IC] members who voted for the Merger appeared to have concluded that the Merger would \u2026 be beneficial [to the NPS].'\"937\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 32 (**R-20**).\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 32, *citing* Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, p. 39 (**R-20**).\n\n611.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that no new evidence has been presented in the course of this arbitration that would cause the Tribunal to question the factual findings of the Seoul Central District Court and Seoul High Court in the Moon/Hong matter or of the Seoul Central District Court in the Merger Annulment Proceedings. In view of the Parties' conflicting readings of these decisions, the Tribunal must determine whether there is indeed a contradiction between the decisions and, if that is the case, the evidentiary weight to be given to each of the decisions.\n\n612.\n\nHaving considered the factual basis of each of the decisions, the Tribunal notes that the judgment of the Seoul District Court in the Merger Annulment Proceedings was based on what the Court itself described as a \"strict\" approach:\n\nSince a merger is a high-level collective action between companies which is achieved by following the procedures set out in the Commercial Act, denying the effect of a merger which has already been achieved is an act of ignoring the will of majority shareholders or causing a great confusion to collective legal relationship \u2026 The Commercial Act does not specify grounds for invalidating a merger, but it would be proper to strictly determine the grounds for invalidation of merger by considering the collective legal nature of the merger and the instability of the legal relationship due to the invalidation of the merger: 1) when the law and regulations restricting a merger have been violated; 2) when the merger agreement fails to follow the statutory requirements; 3) when there is flaw in the merger resolution; 4) when creditor protection has been violated; 5) when the merger ratio is manifestly unfair.938\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, pp. 6 (**R-20**).\n\n613.\n\nOf these potential grounds of invalidation, only the third one \u2013 \"when there is [a] flaw in the merger resolution\" \u2013 could potentially be invoked against the findings of the courts in the Moon/Hong matter. As noted above, the Seoul Central District Court in the Merger Annulment Proceedings concluded that there were no \"sufficient grounds to void or cancel the resolution made at the Shareholders' Meeting\" as Mr. [REDACTED], chairman of the NPS's board of directors, was unaware of the intervention of the MHW and CIO Hong in the NPS's decision-making process; accordingly, the NPS could not be construed to have had an unlawful intent when adopting the resolution.939\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, pp. 35-36 (**R-20**).\n\n614.\n\nIn view of the strict approach adopted by the Court to the determination of the grounds on which a merger resolution could be annulled under Korean law, and the technical approach it adopted to the issue of whether the NPS could be construed to have been aware of the intervention of the MHW and CIO Hong in the NPS's decision-making process, the Tribunal considers that there is no contradiction, in substance, between the decisions of the Korean courts in the Moon/Hong matter, on the one hand, and in the Merger Annulment matter, on the other. It is rather the case that the courts reached what appear to be differing conclusions because the context and purpose of the Merger Annulment proceedings (which involved weighing the consequences of unraveling a merger of two large companies) and the applicable legal standards were different, and accordingly the courts weighed the relevance and materiality of the evidence before them differently. There is also no suggestion in the judgment of the Seoul Central District Court that it disagreed with the findings of fact of the courts in the Moon/Hong matter; it rather considered that those findings were not relevant to the determination of the issues before it, given the applicable legal standard governing corporate intent.940\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2016GaHap510827, 19 October 2017, pp. 35-36 (**R-20**).\n\n615.\n\nThe Court in the Merger Annulment Proceedings also did not have access to the evidence that emerged, only after its judgment was issued, in connection with the criminal proceedings against former President Park and JY Lee. In its judgment issued on 24 August 2018 in the criminal proceedings against former President Park, the Seoul High Court concluded that:\n\nduring the process whereby NPS exercised their voting rights on the Merger, [the AGI Division] ended up making the decision at the Investment Committee, not the Experts' Voting Committee, under MHW's unjust instructions that infringed upon the principle of independence with respect to fund management. The Court also finds that AGI Division induced the Investment Committee to approve the Merger by way of the unreasonably computed fair merger ratio, improvised analysis results on merger synergy and CIO on AGI, AGJ's pressure on members of the Investment Committee. As a result, favorable measure for [JY Lee] was taken in relation to the Merger, which is considered to be the most essential piece of the succession plan.941\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018, p. 86 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\n616.\n\nThe Court also considered former President Park's involvement in the Merger, noting that, at the time of the Merger, \"the [Samsung Group] was facing an emergency situation with aggravating difficulties as [the Claimant] came on the scene,\" and finding, after a review of the relevant evidence, that \"it was inevitable to reach the conclusion that the defendant gave direction or approval during the process of deciding on the approval of the issue of the Merger.\"942\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018, pp. 86-87, 90 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\n617.\n\nThe Court also referred to the meeting held between the former President and Mr. JY Lee on 25 July 2015, finding that the Park Administration had instructed the MHW to \"unduly intervene\" in the NPS's vote on the Merger, and had given \"decisive assistance\" to the Merger:\n\nThe meeting was held immediately after the Merger which was considered as one of the most crucial succession processes when issues such as stricter separation of industrial and financial capital and promotion of economic democratization policies were increasingly brought up for discussion with the status of [Geon-hui Lee]. In order to accelerate the succession to consolidate his control of the group under the succession-friendly [Park] Administration that assisted the Merger, it was necessary for [JY Lee] to show his gratitude to the Defendant with regard to the Merger and ask for continued assistance in connection with the succession.\n\nAround the one-to-one talks on 25 July 2015, the Defendant thought that she could give assistance to [JY Lee's] succession, and her thought was shared by the presidential staff in the Blue House. [The Samsung Group] faced a situation where the success of the Merger hinged on a showdown vote at the general shareholders' meeting with the unexpected emergence of the [Claimant] in the course of the Merger and went all out to seal the Merger in a group-wide effort. By having the Ministry of Health and Welfare unduly intervene in the process of the NPS' exercise of its voting rights, the Defendant and her presidential staff in the Blue House had caused the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger at the general shareholders meeting of [SC&T], which had a decisive influence on sealing the Merger.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the office of [the Blue House] prepared a talking points memo dated July 25, 2015 to provide the Defendant with reference materials to the Defendant for her one-on-one meeting with [JY Lee]. \u2026 [T]he talking points memo contained the following in connection with the succession: \"The corporate governance of [the Samsung Group] is vulnerable to threats from foreign hedge funds, etc. A crisis of [the Samsung Group] is the crisis of the Republic of Korea, so I hope [the Samsung Group's] corporate governance becomes quickly stabilized so that the group can be committed to future affairs in the face of fierce international competition.\"\n\n...\n\nThere was decisive assistance from the [Park] Administration to the Merger immediately prior to the meeting, and such friendly stance of [the Park] Administration was sustained afterwards.\"943\n\nSeoul High Court Case, No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018, pp. 101-03 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\n618.\n\nThe Court's findings establish that not only the MHW but also the administration of the former President Park intervened, by instructing the MHW to intervene, in the Merger vote, including, *inter alia*, to fend off the \"unexpected emergence of [the Claimant].\"\n\n619.\n\nIn a judgment rendered by the Seoul High Court on 10 July 2020 in the remanded criminal proceedings against former President Park, the Seoul High Court confirmed its earlier finding:\n\nThere is no evidence to acknowledge that [JY Lee] had explicitly solicited the Defendant in aid of the succession plan. It is natural for the Defendant (having given decisive assistance to the Merger and intended to continue to support [JY Lee's] succession work and [JY Lee] (having received such decisive assistance for the Merger and required the Defendant's assistance for the subsequent succession work) to have had a conversation during the 25 July 2015 one-on-one meeting about [JY Lee's] primary matter of concern which was the succession of corporate control \u2013 including the Merger that was recently achieved by NPS's approval \u2013 on which [the Samsung Group] had exerted all its powers. There was a decisive assistance from the [Park] Administration to the Merger immediately prior to the meeting, and such friendly stance of the [Park] Administration was sustained towards the succession after the meeting.944\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2019No1962, 10 July 2020, pp. 44-45 (**R-314**). *See also* Seoul High Court Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018, pp. 101-03 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\n620.\n\nThe Korean courts have also found that the Korean State's support for JY Lee's succession plan involved corruption at the highest governmental level. While it does not appear that the State's intervention in the Merger itself was instigated by corruption, Korean courts have found that after the Merger, former President Park's support for the Merger was rewarded by undue benefits. Thus, the Seoul High Court held, in the proceedings against former President Park:\n\nThe pending issue that became the purpose of the solicitation was the succession plan of [JY Lee]. During the one-on-one talks of July 25, 2015, the Defendant demanded sponsorship for a certain organization while asking to \"provide monetary support to an organization founded by medalists from the winter Olympics.\" Moreover, at the one-to-one talks on February 15, 2016, the Defendant demanded a sponsorship of a certain amount by conveying a document titled \"Youth [*Ggumnamu*] Dream Team Promotion Plan Proposal,\" which was prepared by the AA Center.\n\n...\n\nSponsorship for the AA Center was provided between October of 2015 and March of 2016 when the individual issues that form part of the succession plan were proceeding, including the winding of circular-shareholding, the strengthening of defense of management right against foreign capital, and the conversion of [AV] into a financial holding company pursuant to the merger in the present case.\n\n...\n\nWith respect to the sponsorship for the [AA] center, the presence of unjust solicitation that requested for assistance in [JY Lee's] succession plan is found.945\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018, pp. 104-05, 107, 111 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\n621.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the judgment of the Seoul Central District Court in the Merger Annulment Proceedings does not upset its finding, reached above, that the Respondent's conduct in connection with the Merger was incompatible with a substantive rule of customary international law and thus constitutes *prima facie* a breach of the Respondent's MST obligation under Article 11.5 of the Treaty. In view of this finding, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to consider the evidentiary value of indictments issued in proceedings that have not yet resulted in a judgment, or of statements given to the prosecutors in connection with criminal investigations.\n\n622.\n\nThe Tribunal's finding remains subject to its determination of the Respondent's defenses, including its defenses that (i) a breach of an international obligation such as the MST obligation under Article 11.5 of the Treaty requires that the respondent State acted in its capacity as sovereign, and was not engaged in commercial activity; and that (ii) in this case, the conduct of the NPS in connection with the Merger qualifies as purely commercial conduct and is therefore not governed by international law and thus cannot amount to a breach of the Treaty. The Tribunal's finding also remains subject to its determination of the Respondent's further defense, to the effect that the Claimant made its investments in SC&T at a time when the Merger was already foreseeable and thus assumed the risk of the loss for which it is now claiming compensation. The Tribunal will address the former defense in this Section, and the latter defense, which is properly characterized as an argument relating to causation, in Section VI.C below.\n\n623.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that in ordinary circumstances the NPS's conduct in the exercise of its voting rights would likely qualify as commercial conduct. However, the circumstances of the present case are far from ordinary. As established above, when voting on the Merger, the NPS did not act independently and for commercial purposes; as the Korean courts have determined, the NPS did not take its decision independently, based on the commercial merits of the Merger, but acted under the direction and instructions of the MHW and thus effectively as an instrument of the MHW in the implementation of a governmental policy. In light of these considerations, the Tribunal finds that the NPS's conduct in connection with the vote on the Merger qualifies as an exercise of governmental authority (*puissance publique*).\n\n624.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that the Seoul Central District Court specifically found that Minister Moon engaged in \"unlawful uses of *his general powers as a public official*,\" and thereby committing \"an action irrelevant to *official duties*.\"946 (Emphasis added.) The Seoul Central District Court similarly found that CIO Hong breached his \"official duties,\"947 which suggests that, in the Court's view, both Minister Moon and CIO Hong acted in their capacity of public officials when committing the impugned acts.\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 59 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 63 (**C-69**).\n\n625.\n\nIn view of its findings, as set out above, the Tribunal need not reach the question of whether an exercise of governmental authority (*puissance publique*) is a necessary requirement for a breach of Article 11.5 of the Treaty.\n\n626.\n\nHaving determined that the NPS exercised governmental authority when voting on the Merger, the Tribunal must determine whether the Merger vote amounts to a \"measure\" under the Treaty. This is an issue that the Tribunal deferred to the merits as it was closely intertwined with the Respondent's defense on the merits that the NPS's vote on the Merger did not involve exercise of governmental authority and thus could not amount to a breach of the Treaty under international law.948 The Tribunal has determined above in Section V.A.3 that the term \"measure\" is used in the Treaty in a broad sense, governing any kind of \"government action.\" Since the Tribunal has determined above in this Section that the Merger vote qualifies as an exercise of governmental authority under the Treaty, it also necessarily qualifies as a \"measure\" within the meaning of the Treaty, as determined in Section V.A.3 above. Accordingly, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimant's MST claim in its entirety.\n\nSee Section V.A.3 above.\n\n**B. National Treatment**\n-------------------------\n\n627.\n\nArticle 11.3 of the Treaty provides:\n\n**ARTICLE 11.3: NATIONAL TREATMENT**\n\n1.

The U.S. Submission***\n----------------------------\n\n658.\n\nThe United States points out that Article 11.3 of the Treaty is not intended to prohibit all differential treatment among investors or investments, only nationality-based discrimination.1018 Nationality-based discrimination may be *de jure* (facially discriminatory) or *de facto* (facially neutral, but discriminatory on the basis of nationality in its application).1019 Proof of discriminatory intent is not required.1020\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 23.\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 23.\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 23.\n\n659.\n\nAccording to the United States, to establish a breach of national treatment under Article 11.3, a claimant has the burden of proving that it or its investments were accorded \"treatment;\" were in \"like circumstances\" with domestic investors or investments; and received treatment \"less favorable\" than that accorded to the domestic investors or investments identified by the claimant as comparators.1021\n\nU.S. Submission, paras. 22, 24.\n\n660.\n\nThe United States submits that identifying \"like circumstances\" requires a context-dependent, fact-specific inquiry seeking to identify a domestic investor or investment that is alike in all relevant respects but nationality of ownership (rather than simply *any* domestic investor or investment receiving more favorable treatment).1022 In particular, the United States \"understands the term 'circumstances' to denote conditions or facts that accompany treatment as opposed to the treatment itself;\" identifying the relevant circumstances requires looking to the \"totality of the circumstances,\" including whether the treatment distinguishes between investors or investments based on legitimate public welfare objectives.1023\n\nU.S. Submission, paras. 25-27.\n\nU.S. Submission, paras. 25-26.\n\n***4. The Tribunal's Determination***\n-------------------------------------\n\n661.\n\nThe relevant provision of the Treaty for the purposes of the Claimant's national treatment claim is Article 11.3. Article 11.3 provides, in relevant part:\n\n**ARTICLE 11.3: NATIONAL TREATMENT**\n\n1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.\n\n2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.\n\n662.\n\nThe two reservations invoked by the Respondent to bar the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Claimant's national treatment claim \u2013 the Equity Interests Reservation and the Social Services Reservation \u2013 are set forth in Annex II of the Treaty.\n\n663.\n\nAccording to the Equity Interests Reservation, \"Korea reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to the transfer or disposition of equity interests or assets held by state enterprises or governmental authorities.\"\n\n664.\n\nAccording to the Social Services Reservation,\n\nKorea reserves the right to adopt or maintain any measure with respect to the provision of law enforcement and correctional services, and the following services to the extent that they are social services established or maintained for public purpose: income security or insurance, social security or insurance, social welfare, public training, health, and child care.\n\n665.\n\nAs for the Equity Interests Reservation, the Tribunal has determined above that the conduct of the NPS is attributable to the Republic of Korea and therefore qualifies as \"governmental authority\" under the Equity Interests Reservation. The question that arises is whether the NPS's vote on the Merger qualifies as a \"measure with respect to the transfer or disposition of equity interests or assets held by state enterprises or governmental authorities.\"\n\n666.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined above in Section V.A.3 that the term \"measure\" is used in the Treaty in a broad sense, including a \"practice\" or \"an action or a series of actions\" by the Respondent and other forms of \"government action,\" including acts and omissions. The vote on the Merger therefore qualifies as a \"measure\" under the Treaty.\n\n667.\n\nThe remaining question is whether the NPS's vote on the Merger constitutes a measure \"with respect to the \u2026 disposition of equity interests.\" As noted above, the Claimant argues that neither the Respondent's intervention in the NPS's decision-making nor the NPS's vote in favor of the Merger was a \"disposition\" of SC&T shares. According to the Claimant, \"disposition\" \"requires a final step or settlement with respect to the shares, not simply a vote on a proposed transaction.\" The Tribunal notes that the National Treatment provision of the Treaty, Article 11.3, uses the term \"disposition\" in a broad sense, providing that the National Treatment obligation applies to \"the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale *or other disposition* of investments.\" (Emphasis added.) The Tribunal is therefore unable to agree with the Claimant's argument that a \"disposition\" consists only of \"a final step or settlement with respect to the shares.\" In this case, the disposition of the State's shares is a complex act including a vote on the Merger involving the sale of SC&T shares at a certain price, as well as the consummation of the sale as a result of that vote. It therefore falls under the Equity Interests Reservation.\n\n668.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant's claim for breach of the National Treatment obligation in Article 11.3 of the Treaty stands to be dismissed. In the circumstances, the Tribunal need not determine whether the Claimant's claim also stands to be dismissed under the Social Services Reservation.\n\n**C. Assumption of Risk**\n-------------------------\n\n669.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its responsibility under the Treaty is precluded because the Claimant knowingly assumed the risk that the Merger would be approved, and thus that it could incur a loss in respect of its investment.\n\n670.\n\nAs this argument is raised by the Respondent by way of a defense, it will be addressed below before the Claimant's response.\n\n***1. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n671.\n\nThe Respondent argues that where an investor knowingly assumes the risks of its investment, State responsibility is not engaged, and an investor's claim for breach of investment treaty protections cannot be sustained.1024 According to the Respondent, an investor cannot claim damages for actions that occurred or were anticipated before it made its investment, because the expected effects of these actions would have been factored into the price the investor paid.1025 In support of its contention, the Respondent points to a number of awards of investment tribunals, each affirming that investment treaties are not \"insurance policies\" against \"bad business judgments\" or \"the kind of risks that [the relevant claimants] assumed.\"1026\n\nRejoinder, para. 318; Respondent's PHB, para. 63.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 598.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 517-21, *citing* *Waste Management Inc. v.

The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n681.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the Respondent has not established that the principle of assumption of risk is a recognized defense to liability in accordance with the principle of good faith under international law.1050\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 36.\n\n682.\n\nEven assuming that such defense existed under international law, the Claimant denies that it assumed the risk of the Respondent's alleged breaches of the Treaty.1051 In this respect, the Claimant distinguishes between ordinary \"commercial risks\" \u2013 which the Claimant suggests it carefully assessed prior to making its investment and concedes it is not insured against \u2013 and the \"risks of arbitrary and discriminatory measures, fueled by criminal corruption\" at issue in the arbitration.1052\n\nReply, paras. 442-51; Claimant's PHB, para. 143; Claimant's Reply PHB, para. 37.\n\nReply, para. 444; Claimant's PHB, paras. 144-45.\n\n683.\n\nThe Claimant suggests that the decisions in the cases cited by the Respondent upheld assumption of risk defenses related to \"bad business judgments\" in respect of commercial risks or the \"failure of a business plan.\"1053 The Claimant accepts in this regard that it assumed the commercial risks of \"share price fluctuations, the application of the Statutory Formula or the risks that in a fair shareholder vote the shareholders of SC&T would acquiesce to a predatory merger.\"1054\n\nReply, para. 443, *referring to* *Waste Management, Inc. v.

The Tribunal's Determination***\n-------------------------------------\n\n687.\n\nAs summarized above, the Respondent's case is that the legal basis for its assumption of risk defense is the principle of good faith. The Respondent relies, *inter alia*, on *Maffezini*, where the tribunal noted, in an oft-quoted passage, that investment treaties \"are not insurance policies against bad business judgments,\" and that investors should not be allowed to recover under investment treaties for losses resulting from \"business risks inherent in any investment.\"1063 The Respondent notes that several treaty tribunals, including NAFTA tribunals, \"have cited this principle in dismissing investors' claims.\"1064\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 65; *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Award, 13 November 2000, para. 64 (**CLA-33**).\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 65.\n\n688.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that *Maffezini*, or the NAFTA cases cited by the Respondent, purported to establish a legal rule or principle establishing assumption of risk as a legal defense against investment treaty claims, or that the tribunals in those cases had the power to establish such a general rule. Indeed, the passages relied upon by the Respondent rather reflect the tribunals' *factual findings* on the basis of the evidence before them. In other words, in circumstances where the evidence shows that the investor, when making an investment, assumed a certain commercial risk that is always inherent \u2013 indeed by definition \u2013 in any investment, the materialization of such risk, without more, cannot amount to a breach of the applicable investment treaty by the host State. In order to prevail on its claim, the investor must establish that the host State breached the applicable treaty. This is also how the relevant passage of the *Maffezini* award can be read:\n\n63. The Tribunal is also satisfied, after hearing expert and witness testimony on these issues, that the feasibility study made by SODIGA, whether faulty or not, was intended solely for SODIGA's internal purposes of deciding on its own participation in the capital of EAMSA and that it was not intended to serve as a substitute for the study the investor commissioned by hiring COTECNO. Hence, SODIGA cannot be held responsible for cost overruns, whatever their real amount might have been. Moreover, SODIGA's membership on the board of EAMSA, an aspect that has also been raised by the claimant so as to justify an attribution of responsibility in this connection, was also consistent with normal business arrangements. Subsidies were granted by the Spanish State and the Xunta de Galicia at the request of EAMSA and not by SODIGA, thus neither providing a link to potential attribution of responsibility to the latter. Even the preferential rates applied to SODIGA's loans were paid for by the Xunta de Galicia by way of reimbursement.\n\n64. In this connection, the Tribunal must emphasize that Bilateral Investment Treaties are not insurance policies against bad business judgments. While it is probably true that there were shortcomings in the policies and practices that SODIGA and its sister entities pursued in the here relevant period in Spain, they cannot be deemed to relieve investors of the business risks inherent in any investment. To that extent, it is clear that Spain cannot be held responsible for the losses Mr. Maffezini may have sustained any more than would any private entity under similar circumstances.1065\n\n*Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Award, 13 November 2000, paras. 63-64 (**CLA-33**).\n\n689.\n\nThe NAFTA awards cited by the Respondent are similarly based on conclusions reached by the tribunals on the basis of their factual findings, which in the circumstances did not support a finding of breach of treaty.1066\n\n*Waste Management Inc v. United Mexican States (II)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, paras. 108-15 (**CLA-16**); *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award, para. 67 (**RLA-33**); *Fireman's Fund Insurance Company v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/1, Award, 17 July 2006, para. 180 (**RLA-32**).\n\n690.\n\nThe Respondent has also failed to establish that there is any provision in the Treaty or a rule of customary international law to the effect that a claim for breach of an investment treaty can be defeated by what the Respondent characterizes as \"assumption of risk.\"\n\n691.\n\nIt is also evident, on the facts of the present case, that while the Claimant clearly did assume the risk, at the time of making its investment, that the Merger could occur (see Section III.C.1 above), it did not assume the risk that the Korean government would interfere with the Merger vote. Indeed, as determined by the Korean courts, the State's interference with the Merger commenced only towards the end of June 2015,1067 which was well after the Claimant had completed the process of converting its swap positions into direct shareholding.1068 Moreover, it appears that information about the State's interference with the Merger entered the public domain only months later, apparently towards the end of 2016, over a year after the Merger.1069 On the facts, therefore, the Claimant cannot be said to have assumed the risk that the Korean State would intervene in the Merger, and in any event, the risk of a breach of an investment treaty is not a risk that an investor can legitimately be said to have assumed. Indeed, it is the very purpose of an investment treaty to provide protection against its breach by the host State.\n\nSee para. 586 above.\n\nSee para. 173 above.\n\nSee para. 506 above.\n\n692.\n\nThe Respondent's assumption risk defense therefore stands to be dismissed.\n\n**D. The Parties' Requests for Adverse Inferences**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n693.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, both Parties made multiple requests that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences against the other Party for alleged failures to comply with their document production obligations. The Tribunal determined that the \"the appropriate time to take a decision on the Parties' request for adverse inference is indeed the time of the Award.\"1070\n\nProcedural Order No. 18 dated 20 September 2021, para. 79.\n\n***1. The Claimant's Requests***\n--------------------------------\n\n694.\n\nNoting that the Respondent has chosen not to provide any witness evidence from either NPS representatives who attended the meeting of 18 March 2015, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal draw an adverse that inference that \"had the ROK complied with the Tribunal's orders and produced the statement of [REDACTED], that statement would have confirmed Mr. Smith's recollection of this meeting\" that the NPS representatives agreed with Mr. Smith that the Merger on the basis of the two companies' then-current share prices would be detrimental to SC&T shareholders.1071\n\nSee para. 188 above. Reply, para. 42.\n\n695.\n\nIn respect of President Park's alleged personal involvement in directing the NPS's actions in relation to the Merger, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal draw the adverse inferences against the Respondent \"that President Park agreed to wield her significant influence and control over the Blue House, Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the NPS, to cause the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger, in exchange for bribes paid by the Samsung Group,\"1072 and \"that to fulfil her side of the corrupt bargain with Samsung, President Park triggered a chain of instructions reaching from the Blue House, through the Ministry of Health and Welfare, to the NPS.\"1073\n\nClaimant's Application for Adverse inferences dated 14 July 2021, paras. 24, 46(i)(a). *See also* Reply, para. 355(e); Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 117(e).\n\nClaimant's Application for Adverse Inferences dated 14 July 2021, paras. 29, 46(i)(b).\n\n696.\n\nThe Claimant further requests that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences that, in order to achieve the NPS's vote in favor of the Merger:\n\n(a) \"CIO Hong was ultimately pressured by and acted under the instructions of the Blue House and the Ministry officials to have the NPS Investment Committee vote in favor of the Merger;\"1074 and\n\n(b) \"government officials, including CIO Hong, coordinated with Samsung officials, first to try to induce the NPS's [Experts Voting Committee] vote in favor of the Merger, and, once it became clear that the [Experts Voting Committee] would not support the Merger on the terms proposed, conspired instead to have the Investment Committee decide in favor of the Merger.\"1075\n\nClaimant's Application for Adverse Inferences dated 14 July 2021, paras. 33, 46(i)(c).\n\nClaimant's Application for Adverse Inferences dated 14 July 2021, paras. 33, 46(i)(c).\n\n697.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant argues that the Respondent failed to disclose documents which were specifically relied upon in the PPO Indictment, and thus seeks adverse inferences that \"the statement of facts in the ROK's PPO Indictment \u2026 reflect the ROK's genuine belief as to the facts as issue,\" namely those concerning the *quid pro quo* between President Park and JY Lee and the manipulation of SC&T and Cheil share prices before and after the Merger.1076\n\nClaimant's Application for Adverse Inferences dated 14 July 2021, paras. 23, 24(i), 29(i), 33(i), 44.\n\n698.\n\nOn the issue of sovereign immunity of the NPS, the Claimant points out that the Respondent has not denied that the NPS is entitled to claim sovereign immunity in foreign courts but has failed to produce any decisions of courts and tribunals that have upheld or denied the Respondent's claim of sovereign immunity in relation to the NPS in accordance with the Tribunal's decision.1077 Consequently, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal draw an adverse inference that the NPS would be entitled to claim sovereign immunity in the foreign courts.1078\n\nReply, para. 331(1).\n\nReply, para. 331(1); Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, para. 80(c).\n\n***2. The Respondent's Requests***\n----------------------------------\n\n699.\n\nIn respect of whether the Claimant holds a covered investment, the Respondent posits that the Claimant failed to produce documentary evidence regarding the precise timing and the nature of its investment and thus requests the Tribunal to \"draw any negative inferences reasonably resulting from the lack of evidence and dismiss the Claimant's claims.\"1079\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 317.\n\n700.\n\nAs to the Claimant's acquisition of SC&T shares, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's \"deficient descriptions in its privilege log\" warrants an inference that the Claimant knew in January 2015 \u2013 before it started buying SC&T shares \u2013 that the Merger Ratio might damage its investment.1080 Consequently, it requests that the Tribunal draw an adverse inference that the Claimant \"knew and assumed the risk of the Merger's being proposed and passed at the Merger Ratio, during the time it continued to buy shares in [SC&T].\"1081\n\nRejoinder, paras. 535-38.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 532, 534.\n\n701.\n\nIn addition, on the basis of the Claimant's failure to produce a valuation model of SC&T created by Deutsche Bank, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal draw an adverse inference that this valuation model would show, contrary to the Claimant's arguments, that \"the value of [SC&T] was, consistently with an efficient market, its market price.\"1082\n\nRejoinder, paras. 540-43.\n\n702.\n\nFinally, noting that the Claimant failed to produce documents that show the price it paid for all of its swap agreements, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal \"infer that the missing price information is at least equal to the price information that was produced, and accept Professor Dow's calculation of the profit that the Claimant earned form its Cheil swap agreements as proven.\"1083\n\nRejoinder, para. 533.\n\n***3. The Tribunal's Determination***\n-------------------------------------\n\n703.\n\nAs summarized above, the Parties' requests for adverse inferences are based on the alleged failure by the opposing Party to comply with their document production obligations. The Tribunal notes that, in light of the Tribunal's findings above, and further in Section VIII.G below, such requests have become either irrelevant or otherwise moot. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Parties' requests for adverse inferences.\n\n**VII. CAUSATION**\n------------------\n\n704.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent, as a result of its unlawful intervention, caused the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger, that the vote caused the Merger to be approved, and that the Merger approval caused a loss to the Claimant.\n\n705.\n\nThe Respondent denies the causal nexus alleged by the Claimant.\n\n**A. The Applicable Legal Standards**\n-------------------------------------\n\n706.\n\nPursuant to Article 11.16(1)(a) of the Treaty, a claimant \"on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim \u2026 that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\" The Parties differ as to the legal test for causation under Article 11.16(1)(a) of the Treaty and public international law.\n\n***1. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n707.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the recognized test of causation in public international law distinguishes between causation in fact and causation in law (or proximate causation).1084 While the former requires that, \"but for the State's wrongful acts, a claimant would have sustained the injury alleged,\" the latter requires that \"the injury falls within the scope of injury that can, as a matter of law, result from the wrongful act, namely, injury that is foreseeable, not too remote, and is the natural consequence of the wrongful act.\"1085\n\nReply, para. 504.\n\nReply, para. 504.\n\n708.\n\nThe Claimant rejects any further distinction between \"liability causation\" and \"loss causation\" as suggested by the Respondent.1086 It argues that the Respondent seeks to introduce causation as an \"obstacle\" to establishing a breach of the Treaty, contrary to the law of State responsibility.1087 In any case, according to the Claimant, the Respondent's framing of its \"liability causation\" analysis at the stage of post-hearing briefs (as opposed to earlier pleadings) in fact comports with the Claimant's analysis.1088\n\nReply, para. 504.\n\nReply, paras. 502-03.\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 42.\n\n709.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's position that, in international law, a claimant must demonstrate that it would not have suffered harm but-for the State's wrongful conduct.1089 Rather, according to the Claimant, international law requires the Claimant to demonstrate only that the Claimant would not have suffered the harm it did but-for the Respondent's breaches.1090\n\nClaimant's PHB, paras. 167-68.\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 168.\n\n710.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant argues that \"an enquiry into a *sine qua non* condition does not require a claimant to establish that no other factual scenario could have led to the same result.\"1091 Rather, it is sufficient for the Claimant to show that the Respondent's wrongdoing was the reason why the Merger was approved.1092\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 49.\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 49.\n\n711.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimant denies the relevance of the English court judgment referred to by the Respondent as authority for the proposition that an intervening independent decision breaks the chain of causation.1093 The Claimant argues that, while the \"judgment stands for the proposition that the consequences of an independent act in a chain of causation are too remote from the original wrong to be deemed causally connected to the original wrongdoing,\" in the present case \"the independence of the act in question is precisely the issue in dispute.\"1094\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 48.\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 48.\n\n712.\n\nThe Claimant finally denies that international law imposes a high standard for establishing causation.1095 In the Claimant's view, the standard that an injury must \"in all probability\" or with a \"sufficient degree of certainty\" have been caused by the breach \"is not higher than the standard of proof generally applied in international law, namely the 'balance of probabilities' or 'preponderance of the evidence' standard.\"1096\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 168.\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 43.\n\n***2. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n713.\n\nThe Respondent's starting point is that \"there cannot be a claim under the Treaty unless the Claimant first shows that the Respondent caused the breach of the Treaty.\"1097 According to the Respondent, the Claimant must show, first, that \"but for\" the alleged wrongful conduct, the harmful event would not have occurred; and, second, that the alleged wrongful conduct was the proximate cause of the harming event.1098\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 393; Rejoinder, paras. 150, 155-57.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 404.\n\n714.\n\nThe concept of proximate cause in turn requires that the harm to the Claimant must be incurred \"by reason of, or arising out of\" the Respondent's breach of the Treaty.1099 This implies a \"clear,\" \"unbroken\" and \"legally significant connection\" between the impugned act and the alleged loss.1100 No compensation is due for losses that are \"too indirect, remote, and uncertain.\"1101\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 623, *citing* Treaty, Art 11.16.1(a)(ii) (**C-1**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 405, *citing Administrative Decision No. II*, 7 RIAA, 1 November 1923, p. 29 (**RLA-2**); *Methanex Corporation v.

International Arbitration Awards 1905, p. 1931 (**RLA-1**).\n\n715.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent argues that that there must be no intervening cause \u2013 that is, the Claimant must \"show that the last, direct act, the immediate cause \u2026 did not become a superseding cause and thereby the proximate cause.\"1102 The Respondent further contends that the Claimant must show that the Respondent's impugned conduct in breach of the Treaty was the \"dominant cause\" of its alleged loss.1103 The Respondent also suggests that if \"a Treaty-compliant process could have led to the same result, damages are not available.\"1104\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 625, *citing* *Ronald S. Lauder v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 September 2001, para. 234 (**RLA-20**).\n\nRejoinder, para. 466, *referring to* *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula, S.C. European Food S.A, S.C.

The Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2009-04, Award on Damages, 10 January 2019, paras. 168-76 (**RLA-90**).\n\n716.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant has the burden of proving both but-for (factual) and proximate (legal) causation at two stages of its claim: to establish liability and to recover its alleged loss.1105 Specifically, the Respondent contends that the relevant question for liability causation is whether, even if the Tribunal finds a breach of the Treaty, \"the wrongful conduct made a difference to the NPS's decision to approve the Merger.\"1106 The relevant question for loss causation is whether, even if the Tribunal finds a breach of the Treaty, \"the ROK's breach, and not any intervening cause, must have caused the loss claimed.\"1107\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 87.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 87.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 87.\n\n717.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant must establish \"that the result of the impugned conduct would not have happened absent the ROK's breaches of the Treaty.\"1108 The Respondent bases its argument on the ICJ's judgment in the *Bosnian Genocide* case, in which the Court decided that a \"sufficiently direct and certain causal nexus\" requires that it can be concluded \"with a sufficient degree of certainty\" that the result of the impugned conduct \"would in fact have been averted if the Respondent had acted in compliance with its legal obligations.\"1109\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 88.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 89, *citing* Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007, para. 462 (**CLA-24**).\n\n718.\n\nThe Respondent further refers to domestic legal authority in support of the proposition that \"a decision made in the independent exercise of a discretion negates the causal connection\" of injury with the original wrongful act.1110 According to an English court judgment, \"[w]hen there comes in the chain the act of a person who is bound by law to decide a matter judicially and independently, the consequences of his decision are too remote from the original wrong which gave him a chance of deciding\" so that \"the liability of [the] defendant for damages stops when the damage is only continued by the independent act of a person under a legal duty to form an independent opinion.\"1111\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 95.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 95, *citing Harnett v. Bond and Another* [1924] 2 KB 517 (**RLA-141**).\n\n719.\n\nThe Respondent finally contends that, in international law, a \"high standard of factual certainty\" is required to establish causation. The Respondent cites the award in *Bilcon v. Canada*, which states:\n\nAuthorities in public international law require a high standard of factual certainty to prove a causal link between breach and injury: the alleged injury must \"in all probability\" have been caused by the breach (as in *Chorz\u00f3w*), or a conclusion with a \"sufficient degree of certainty\" is required that, absent a breach, the injury would have been avoided (as in *Genocide*). While the facts of the *Genocide* case were of course markedly different from those underlying the present arbitration, there is an important similarity: the ICJ, as the Tribunal in the present case, was confronted with a situation of factual uncertainty, where in the view of one of the parties, the same injury would have occurred even in the absence of unlawful conduct.\n\nAn even stricter approach was established in *Nordzucker*, where the tribunal enquired whether the State's conduct \"necessarily\" led the investor to act in ways that harmed its profitability.1112\n\nRejoinder, paras. 432-33, *referring to* *Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. and others v.

The U.S. Submission***\n----------------------------\n\n720.\n\nThe United States submits that Article 11.16(a)(ii) of the Treaty requires that the Claimant establish \u2013 as a necessary but not a sufficient condition for reparation \u2013 the causal nexus between the alleged breach and the harm suffered.1113 The United States notes that the investor must establish both factual (but-for) causation and proximate causation.1114 Furthermore, the United States notes that proximate causation is among the \"applicable rules of international law\" pursuant to Article 11.22.1 of the Treaty.1115\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 9.\n\nU.S. Submission, paras. 9-11.\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 11.\n\n721.\n\nThe United States observes that factual causation requires a showing that an outcome would not have occurred but for the conduct of the State in violation of its obligations.1116 According to the United States:\n\nThe standard for factual causation is known as the \"but-for\" or \"*sine qua non*\" test whereby an act causes an outcome if the outcome would not have occurred in the absence of the act. This test is not met if the same result would have occurred had the breaching State acted in compliance with its obligations.1117\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 9.\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 9.\n\n722.\n\nIn support, the United States refers to case law of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, which concluded that \"if one were to reach the conclusion that both tortious (or obligation-breaching) and non-tortious (obligation-compliant) conduct of the same person would have led to the same result, one might question that the tortious (or obligation-breaching) conduct was *conditio sine qua non* of the loss the claimant seeks to recover.\"1118 The United States also relies on the *Bosnian Genocide* judgment of the ICJ.1119\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 9, *citing* Islamic Republic of Iran v.

Serbia and Montenegro), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007, para. 462 (**CLA-24**).\n\n723.\n\nProximate causation, in turn, requires that the \"harm must not be too remote\" \u2013 that is, the harm must be \"sufficiently 'direct,' 'foreseeable,' or 'proximate'\" \u2013 and cannot be based on \"acts, events, or circumstances not attributable to the alleged breach.\"1120\n\nU.S. Submission, para. 10-11, *citing* ILC Articles (with commentaries) (2001), Commentary to Article 31, p. 93 (**CLA-38**).\n\n**B. Whether the Respondent Caused the NPS to Vote in Favor of the Merger**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n724.\n\nThe Claimant argues that there are two \"causal pathways, either of which is sufficient to establish causality as a matter of international law,\" to link the NPS vote in favor of the Merger to the Respondent.1121 First, the Claimant contends that, but for the instruction to bypass the Expert Voting Committee, the decision would have been referred to that Committee, which would not have voted in favor of the Merger.1122 Second, the Claimant alleges that, in any event, but for the fabrication of a valuation and synergy effect, the Investment Committee would not have voted in favor of the Merger.1123\n\nClaimant's PHB, paras. 161-62.\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 161(a).\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 161(b).\n\n**(a) President Park's alleged instructions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n725.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Merger decision was the \"direct result\" of directions of ROK officials at the Blue House and MHW.1124 According to the Claimant, President Park \"recogniz[ed] the pivotal role the NPS would play in determining whether the Merger went ahead\" after the Experts Voting Committee decided to vote against the SK Merger and instructed her staff to \"monitor\" the Merger.1125\n\nReply, para. 432.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 97.\n\n726.\n\nThe Claimant relies on evidence from Korean domestic criminal proceedings allegedly recording President Park's instructions to other senior Blue House officials, and the Blue House officials' instructions in turn to the MHW, to \"send the Blue House information regarding the status of the NPS's decision-making process.\"1126\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, paras. 98-100.\n\n727.\n\nAmong other evidence, the Claimant refers to a handwritten memorandum prepared in August or September 2014 by Mr. Yeong-sang Lee,1127 the Blue House's Executive Official to the Secretary of Civil Affairs, which in the Claimant's view \"records that the NPS could be used as a means to assist the Lee Family with succession of control of the Samsung Group.\"1128\n\nYeong-sang Lee's Handwritten Memo, undated, p. 4 (**C-585**).\n\nReply, para. 89.\n\n728.\n\nThe Claimant points out that President Park allegedly met one-on-one with JY Lee on 15 September 2014.1129 Referring to evidence from Korean criminal proceedings, the Claimant argues that President Park accepted financial support for her favored organization as a *quid pro quo* for assisting with Samsung's managerial succession.1130\n\nReply, para. 91. *See also* Reply, para. 435.\n\nReply, para. 91.\n\n729.\n\nThe Claimant also points to an internal Blue House memorandum that considered whether the ROK should \"*intervene* in the NPS's exercise of voting rights\" and how it should \"set\" the NPS vote.1131\n\nReply, para. 95, *citing* Blue House, \"Direction of the National person Service's Exercise of Voting Rights regarding Samsung C&T Merger,\" p. 41 (**C-588**).\n\n730.\n\nPresident Park then allegedly \"set in motion a chain of instructions that would cascade through the Blue House, the Ministry and ultimately the NPS to 'actively intervene[] in the exercise of voting rights by NPS related to the Merger.'\"1132\n\nReply, para. 104, *citing* Seoul High Court No. 2018No1087, 24 August 2018, p. 90 (**C-286/R-169**).\n\n731.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's contention that the instruction at this step was only to \"monitor\" a merger \"is contradicted by [] evidence.\"1133 According to the Claimant, the evidence shows that President Park \"was fixed resolutely on the way in which her Ministry, and through her Ministry its pensions agency, was addressing an overwhelmingly clear Presidential direction to support the Lee Family's succession plan and defeat Elliott's opposition, by voting 'yes' to the Merger.\"1134\n\nReply, para. 107.\n\nReply, para. 107.\n\n**(b) The MHW's alleged instructions**\n--------------------------------------\n\n732.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the MHW pressured,1135 and eventually instructed,1136 the NPS Investment Committee to approve the Merger through a \"chain of command [that] extended from President Park and the Blue House directly and through the Ministry to the NPS.\"1137 Relying on evidence from the Korean criminal proceedings, the Claimant alleges that on the instruction of President Park or her staff, Minister Moon, in turn, instructed Ministry officials to meet with the NPS's CIO Hong to steer the vote in favor of approval.1138\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 103.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, paras. 103-04.\n\nReply, para. 108.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, paras. 103-04;

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n754.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, even if one were to assume that the Respondent had intervened in the NPS's voting processes, there would be no Treaty breach if either the NPS could have voted the same way absent its intervention or the Merger could still have been approved absent the NPS's affirmative vote.1187\n\nRejoinder, paras. 152-53.\n\n755.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's view that the relevant but-for inquiry is \"whether the NPS's vote caused the Merger.\"1188 According to the Respondent, the NPS was at liberty to exercise its voting rights \"however it wished\" without being bound by any \"duty to any other shareholder\" of SC&T.1189 The relevant inquiry is whether the Respondent's *wrongful conduct* (rather than the fact of the NPS's vote) caused the Merger; to that end, the Respondent criticizes the Claimant's unsubstantiated assertion that the NPS \"almost assuredly\" would have voted against the Merger but for the allegedly undue influence.1190 Relying on the standard set forth in *Bosnian Genocide* and *Bilcon v. Canada*, the Respondent argues that the Claimant must establish \"in all probability\" or \"with a sufficient degree of certainty\" that the NPS would not have voted for the Merger in a Treaty-compliant scenario.1191\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 397.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 397.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 469, *referring to* Amended Statement of Claim, paras. 84, 115, 65.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 469, *citing* *Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. and others v.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant cannot prove with a sufficient degree of certainty that (i) \"absent the ROK's alleged wrongful conduct, the Investment Committee members would not have considered the Merger;\"1192 (ii) \"had there not been any 'governmental order,' the Investment Committee members would not have voted the way they did, i.e., by majority in favour of the Merger;\"1193 and (iii) the Experts Voting Committee, on the assumption that the vote would have been referred to it, would have rejected the Merger.1194\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 91.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 92.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 93.\n\n757.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondent alleges that there are several breaks in the Claimant's causal chain, any one of which is sufficient to defeat the Claimant's argument that the Respondent's alleged wrongful conduct caused the approval of the Merger.1195\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 467.\n\n**(a) President Park's alleged instructions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n758.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, President Park's request that her staff \"monitor\" the Merger does not prove that the Respondent caused the Merger.1196 The Respondent argues that the evidence only suggests the Blue House was monitoring Samsung's management succession, \"not \u2026 the Merger specifically.\"1197 According to the Respondent, the Blue House's concern in monitoring the management succession was to ensure that the \"management of the Samsung Group could be handed over to someone else in a stable manner, because the succession of management of the Samsung Group could greatly affect the Korean economy.\"1198\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 427.\n\nRejoinder, para. 169.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 170-71.\n\n759.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent contends that there is no evidence that the Blue House directed and controlled the outcome of the Merger vote.\"1199 The Respondent emphasizes that the evidence adduced by the Claimant relates at best to communications between the Blue House and the MHW, but does not prove an \"instruction to approve\" nor make out a \"connection between the activities in the Blue House as detailed in the [Amended Statement of Claim] and the NPS's voting for the Merger.\"1200 The Respondent characterizes the Blue House's role as a passive one, with Blue House officials receiving information from the MHW.1201\n\nRejoinder, paras. 176, 178-79.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 428.\n\nRejoinder, para. 177.\n\n760.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant's reference to a handwritten memorandum prepared by Mr. Yeong-sang Lee omits what the Respondent interprets as \"the Blue House's recognition that \u2026 JY Lee might lose control of the Samsung Group if he did not prove himself able to manage the company successfully.\"1202 The Respondent also alleges that Mr. Lee did not state that the NPS's shareholding could be used to facilitate the succession, but only that \"there could have been an examination of the NPS's exercise of voting \u2026 for some reason 'related' to the Samsung Group's management succession issues.\"1203\n\nRejoinder, para. 172(a), *referring to* Yeong-sang Lee's Handwritten Memo, p. 4 (**C-585**).\n\nRejoinder, para. 172(b), *referring to* Reply, para. 89; Transcript of Court Testimony of Yeong-sang Lee (JY Lee Seoul Central District Court), 25 July 2017, pp. 21-22, 31 (**R-296**); Statement Report of Yeong-sang Lee to the Public Prosecutor's Office, 17 July 2017, pp 12-13 (**C-522**).\n\n761.\n\nThe Respondent also challenges the inference of a *quid pro quo* relationship suggested by the Claimant on the basis of the 15 September 2014 meeting between former President Park and JY Lee.1204 The Respondent refers to court decisions and media reports stating that the meeting was not pre-arranged but serendipitous, occurring after President Park asked JY Lee for a \"short meeting that lasted only five minutes\" at a ceremony that both were attending on that day.1205 The Respondent notes that according to his testimony, Mr. Yeong-sang Lee was unaware of this meeting when he prepared his August/September 2014 memorandum.1206 The Respondent also alleges, based on findings in the Korean court proceedings, that \"at the 15 September 2014 meeting, President Park did not promise any favors in return for the support that she solicited from JY Lee;\" in fact, JY Lee did not promise to provide any financial support until after a 25 July 2015 meeting, well after the Merger Vote.1207\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 157; Rejoinder, paras. 173-74.\n\nRejoinder, para. 174(a), *referring to* Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap364-1, 6 April 2018, p 44 (**C-280**); \"[Reconstructing the meeting between Park and JY Lee] 1.

The Respondent's own translation (**R-99**) does not use mandatory language.

The Tribunal's Determination**\n-----------------------------------\n\n813.\n\nThe relevant standard under the Treaty for purposes of causation is Article 11.16(1)(a), which provides that, in the event an investment dispute cannot be resolved by negotiation, a claimant \"on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim (i) that the respondent has breached [an obligation under the Treaty] and (ii) that the claimant *has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach*.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n814.\n\nThe provision thus makes clear that causation \u2013 whether a claimant \"has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach\" \u2013 is about the relationship between the alleged breach and the claimed loss or damage, and not about the relationship between the respondent and the alleged breach, which is a matter of attribution rather than causation. The Tribunal therefore cannot accept the Respondent's argument that the Claimant must prove that the Respondent caused the NPS to breach the Treaty. Indeed, the Tribunal has already determined above in Section V.B.4 that the conduct of the NPS is attributable to the Republic of Korea. The Claimant therefore need not show that the Respondent caused the NPS to breach the Treaty; for the purposes of determining whether the Respondent breached the Treaty, the conduct of the NPS is attributable to the Respondent.\n\n815.\n\nThe two relevant aspects of causation that the Tribunal must consider are causation in fact and causation in law. The former involves the determination of whether the claimant would have suffered the claimed loss or damage in the absence of the alleged breach, whereas the latter is about whether the claimed loss or damage is sufficiently closely linked to the alleged breach. The required link may be determined in terms of whether the claimed loss or damage is a \"direct\" result of the alleged breach, or whether it is \"proximately\" caused by the alleged breach; and the Parties in this case have argued the issue of causation in these terms, without clearly distinguishing between the two.1343 The two formulations are indeed technically distinguishable but in substance equivalent ways of stating the applicable test for determining whether the required causal link between the alleged breach and the claimed loss or damage has been established \u2013 the former formulation states the applicable test by starting the analysis from the *cause* of the alleged loss or damage (*i.e.* the alleged breach), whereas the latter starts the analysis from the *effect* of the alleged breach (*i.e.* the claimed loss or damage). Both approaches also accept that there may be an intervening cause that breaks the chain of causation, rendering the alleged loss or damage \"indirect\" or too \"remote\" to be compensated.1344\n\nSee Section VII.A-D above.\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Second Partial Award, 21 October 2002, para. 140 (**RLA-23**). *See also* *Ronald S. Lauder v. The Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 September 2001, para. 234 (**RLA-20**); *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, para. 138 (**RLA-22**).\n\n816.\n\nThe causation in fact has been addressed by the Korean courts in the decisions addressed above. Thus the Seoul Central District Court found in the Moon/Hong proceedings that there was \"reasonable doubt\" that the share price of SC&T was being manipulated by the Samsung Group to generate a favorable Merger Ratio for SC&T shareholders, and in the circumstances, the NPS held a casting vote\":\n\nSuch actions were objective circumstances that provided for a reasonable doubt that the Merger was planned to occur at a time that was most favourable to the Cheil shareholders, including the Samsung Group family members such as [JY Lee], and that the Samsung Group deliberately engineered SC&T's poor performance to generate a disadvantageous merger ratio for SC&T shareholders.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the NPS, as the largest shareholder of SC&T holding 11.21% stake, would profit from an advantageous merger ratio for SC&T because it would be able to own a higher percent of shares of the merged company. At the time, Elliott Associates, L.P. (\"Elliott\"), an international fund which had amassed a 7.12% stake in SC&T, vehemently opposed the Merger in the interests of the SC&T shareholders. As Elliott opposed the Merger, the NPS held a casting vote.1345\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 3-4 (**C-69**).\n\n817.\n\nThe Court further found that \"[i]n regards to the Merger, the NPS had a *de facto* casting vote as the largest shareholder of SC&T\"; and that \"[t]he merger ratio was such that major shareholders of the Samsung Group such as [JY Lee] would be at a gain, and SC&T shareholders would be at a loss.\"1346 The Court further held:\n\nIt can thus be inferred that [Mr. Hong's] breach of duty caused a risk of loss to NPS's assets. And unlike other SC&T shareholders, NPS held a casting vote on the Merger, and the approval of the Merger had a direct effect of profiting the major shareholders of the Samsung group such as [JY Lee]. Here, the losses to NPS should be assessed as the difference between what the financial status of NPS would have been had the Merger not been approved, and its financial status after the approval of the Merger. Such difference could be calculated by comparing the economic value (or shareholder value) of the SC&T and Cheil Industries shares that NPS owned before and after July 10, 2015, the date in which the committee decided in favor of the Merger.1347\n\nSeoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, p. 61 (**C-69**).\n\nSeoul Central District Court, Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 63-64 (**C-69**). The Court also held that CIO Hong ignored principles of investment management such as the obligation to \"exercise voting rights in the direction of increasing shareholder value and profitability of the Fund,\" and \"[a]s a result, the NPS suffered losses, such as no longer having the casting vote for the Merger, and suffering a decrease in share value.\" Seoul Central District Court Case No. 2017GoHap34, 183 (Consolidated), 8 June 2017, pp. 66-67 (**C-69**).\n\n818.\n\nOn appeal, the Seoul High Court agreed with and \"acknowledged\" the finding of fact of the Seoul Central District Court that, in view of Elliott's opposition to the Merger, the NPS held a *de facto* casting vote:\n\nMeanwhile, an international hedge fund Elliott Associates, L.P. (\"Elliott\") disclosed around June 4, 2015 the fact that they held 7.12% of shares in SC&T, announced their objective to participate in management, and actively opposed the Merger on the grounds that the Merger Ratio in this case was unfavorable to SC&T shareholders. Around that time, considering the ownership of SC&T's shares and the interests of several SC&T shareholders, [the NPS's] vote in favor of the Merger, which held 11.21% of shares in SC&T, was absolutely necessary to secure more than two-thirds of the participating votes required to approve the Merger. Accordingly, the [NPS] came to have the *de facto* casting vote that would determine whether the Merger would proceed.1348\n\nSeoul High Court Case No. 2017No1886, 14 November 2017, p. 9 (**C-79**/**R-153**).\n\n819.\n\nThe Korean Courts have thus found that the NPS held a casting vote, and that there was therefore a direct causal link between the NPS's vote on the Merger and the loss suffered by the NPS and other SC&T shareholders, including the Claimant.\n\n820.\n\nThere is no evidence before the Tribunal in the present proceedings that would cause the Tribunal to second-guess the findings of the Korean courts. While the Respondent seeks to rely on the witness evidence of Mr. Cho, a member of the Experts Voting Committee, to argue that the evidence does not show that the members of the Experts Voting Committee would have voted against the Merger, it acknowledges that Mr. Cho did not state in his witness statements that he would have voted in favor of the Merger (or indeed against it, as he was undecided), had the matter been referred to the Experts Voting Committee.1349 His evidence is therefore inconclusive and, in any event, the Respondent does not challenge the findings of the Korean courts but indeed specifically accepts them, as noted above.1350\n\nFirst YG Cho Statement, para. 30 (**RWS-1**); Second YG Cho Statement, paras. 5-6 (**RWS-2**)\n\nSee para. 266 above.\n\n821.\n\nAs for legal causation, the Tribunal is satisfied that, as the acts of the NPS are attributable to the Respondent, the loss and damage claimed by the Claimant is a direct result of the Respondent's conduct and thus was proximately caused by the Respondent. There is no evidence before the Tribunal of any intervening act that would have broken the chain of causation between the NPS's vote and the claimed loss and damage. While the Respondent argues that the outcome of the NPS's vote on the Merger was leaked to the market a few days before the EGM and this fact therefore affected the vote of the other shareholders, the Respondent has not shown that the leak caused any change in the position of other shareholders between the leak and the EGM. The Tribunal is therefore unable to conclude that, had the result of the vote not been leaked, the outcome of the vote at the EGM would have been different. The leak therefore cannot constitute an intervening act that interrupted the chain of causation. Hence the Tribunal need not consider the Claimant's argument that the leak forms part of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty.\n\n822.\n\nThe Tribunal is also unable to agree with the Respondent's argument that there was no causal link or that any such link was interrupted because the Experts Voting Committee *could* also have rejected the Merger, or that even if the NPS had voted against the Merger, any of the shareholders that held more than 2.7% of the shares *could* have voted against the Merger, which would have prevented the approval of the Merger. A chain of causation is not interrupted by a potential event; it can only be interrupted by an event that has actually taken place. Neither of the potential events relied upon by the Respondent has in fact taken place, and accordingly they could not have broken the chain of causation.\n\n823.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the NPS's vote on the Merger caused the harm claimed by the Claimant. This finding is without prejudice to the Tribunal's determination as to whether the Claimant has established that it has, in fact, suffered any quantifiable ham, an issue which will be addressed in the next Section. The Tribunal will also in that connection deal with the Respondent's argument that it cannot be held liable for any losses that the Claimant may have suffered due to Samsung's manipulation or suppression of market prices and the operation of the statutory formula (the Merger Ratio). These issues are closely intertwined with the question of quantum and are properly dealt with in that context.\n\n**VIII. QUANTUM**\n-----------------\n\n824.\n\nThe Parties agree that any compensation to which the Claimant may be entitled should be quantified as the difference between the fair market value (the \"**FMV**\") of the Claimant's shares in SC&T in the but-for scenario and the actual sales proceeds from the Claimant's sale of SC&T shares. The Parties disagree on the appropriate valuation method for determining the FMV of SC&T shares in the but-for scenario as well as the underlying assumptions in performing the valuation, including the effect of the rejection of the Merger on the FMV of SC&T shares.\n\n**A. The Claimant's Valuation on the basis of Intrinsic Value**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n825.\n\nThe Claimant bases its case on quantum on the opinion of Mr. Boulton, its quantum expert. Mr. Boulton calculates the value of the Claimant's shares in SC&T in the but-for scenario on the basis of a \"sum of the parts\" (\"**SOTP**\") valuation (*i.e.* an analysis in which each of the assets held by a company is valued separately, and the values of the assets are then summed to arrive at a valuation of the company).1351 The Claimant considers that Mr. Boulton's SOTP analysis reflects SC&T's \"intrinsic value.\"1352 According to the Claimant, such intrinsic value represents the value of SC&T shares in the but-for scenario.1353\n\nFirst Boulton Report, para. 4.3.1 (**CER-3**).\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 264.\n\nReply, paras. 583-85; Second Boulton Report, paras. 2.4.4, 2.8.2 (**CER-3**).\n\n826.\n\nThe Claimant explains that the observed discount then applied by Mr. Boulton in valuing SC&T can be divided into two components: a \"holding company discount,\" which applies to SC&T because of its characteristics as a Korean holding company, and an \"excess discount,\" which arises because of market concerns of a predatory transaction, such as the Merger, as well as market manipulation in support of the Merger.1354\n\nSecond Boulton Report, para. 2.5.3 (**CER-5**).\n\n827.\n\nThe Claimant submits that a rejection of the Merger, as is to be assumed in the but-for scenario, would have had a \"therapeutic effect,\" reflecting the \"market's understanding that the New SC&T is no longer a target of a predatory transaction to benefit the Lee Family.\"1355 According to the Claimant, this \"therapeutic effect\" would have significantly narrowed the discount between SC&T's share price and its \"intrinsic value.\"1356 The Claimant argues that this would have caused a substantial majority of the \"observed discount\" to the \"intrinsic value\" to unwind.1357 The Claimant therefore concludes that it is entitled to an amount of USD 306,950,089 or, alternatively, USD 408,253,247 in damages, depending on the applicable rate of the holding company discount.1358\n\nReply, para. 595; Second Boulton Report, para. 6.5.4 and Section 8.2 (**CER-5**).\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 208.\n\nReply, para. 593, 595, *referring to* Second Boulton Report, paras. 2.5(iii), 2.8.5, 3.3.4, 4.2.22, 6.5.12-6.5.15, 6.9.5 (**CER-5**). *See also* Reply, para. 594 (alleging that the \"NPS's own contemporaneous expectation [was] that the price of SC&T stock would 'skyrocket' if the Merger were not approved\").\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 102.

and (ii) an \"excess discount,\" which would have dissipated if the Merger had been rejected.1373 Moreover, the Claimant highlights Mr. Boulton's observation that part of the observed discount was attributable to tunneling, \"both in the sense of actions to influence the share price and market appreciation of a risk that SC&T would be the target of a predatory transaction.\"1374\n\nSecond Boulton Report, paras. 2.5.7(III), 4.2.22, 6.2.3-6.2.4 (**CER-5**).\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 209.\n\n834.\n\nProfessor Milhaupt similarly takes the view that the primary driver of the \"wedge\" between SC&T's intrinsic value and its share price is one of the \"favored features of the corporate governance practices of the *chaebol*;\"1375 the risk of \"tunneling\" or \"related-party\" transactions that direct the \"private benefits of control\" to the *chaebol*'s controlling family at the expense of unaffiliated minority shareholders.1376\n\nMilhaupt Report, para. 54 (**CER-6**).\n\nMilhaupt Report, paras. 18, 22, 56, 73-79 (**CER-6**). *See also* Reply, para. 587.\n\n835.\n\nAs to the quantification of the two discounts, Mr. Boulton submits that any discount between the traded price of New SC&T (*i.e.* the merged entity) and its intrinsic value that persisted after the Merger represented a true holding company discount, since the risk of a predatory transaction had disappeared as the Merger had been accomplished.1377 Consequently, Mr. Boulton concludes that of the approximately 40% observed discount that is reflected in the Merger Ratio, \"5% to 15% is properly described as a holding company discount.\"1378 Conversely, the rest of the observed discount constitutes the excess discount attributable either directly to Samsung's efforts to influence share price or indirectly to market fears of a predatory merger.1379\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 209;

Furthermore, a large part of the \"observed discount\" between the two values was attributable to a SC&T-specific \"excess discount\" rather than any generalized discount applicable to all Korean *chaebol* companies. The Claimant submits that the rejection of the Merger would have caused a \"therapeutic effect\" to the FMV of the SC&T shares, which should have significantly narrowed the discount between SC&T's share price and its \"intrinsic value.\"1393\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 216.\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 208.\n\n841.\n\nAs noted above, Professor Milhaupt considers that the risk of tunneling transactions was the primary cause of the SC&T's observed discount. Accordingly, in the relevant but-for scenario where the Merger would have been rejected, he opines that such event would have informed the market that SC&T's minority shareholders were protected from predatory transactions, thereby removing \"the primary driver of the discount\" and increasing SC&T's share price towards its \"intrinsic value.\"1394\n\nReply, para. 558(c), 591, *referring to* Milhaupt Report, paras. 84-87, 89 (**CER-6**).\n\n842.\n\nProfessor Milhaupt submits that, had the Merger been voted down by minority shareholders, the event \"could be expected to have therapeutic effects to the benefit of all unaffiliated shareholders\" because of the \"potential to mitigate the agency conflict between family controllers and minority investors, thereby improving corporate governance in the ROK and reducing the '*chaebol*/Korea discount.'\"1395 According to Professor Milhaupt, the rejection of the Merger \"would have informed the market that, notwithstanding SC&T's affiliation to Samsung *chaebol*, SC&T's minority/unaligned shareholders would protect it from predatory transactions that looted its value in order to benefit another, favored *chaebol* affiliate and the controlling Lee Family.\"1396\n\nMilhaupt Report, para. 9 (**CER-6**). *See also* Reply, para. 591.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n846.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's SOTP analysis is based on far-fetched assumptions.1404 In particular, the Respondent takes the view that a \"realistic\" discount in valuing SC&T would be approximately 40 percent.1405 The Respondent also contends that the \"holding company discount\" would not have dissipated even assuming that the Merger was rejected, because the discount was based on SC&T's holding company structure and the associated governance problems, and these factors would have remained the same after the rejection of the Merger.1406\n\nSecond Dow Report, para. 131 (**RER-3**).\n\nRespondent's PHB, paras. 212-20.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 490(e), 508, *referring to* Second Boulton Report, para. 189 (**CER-5**); Milhaupt Report, para. 88 (**CER-6**).\n\n847.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the alleged \"excess discount\" exists,1407 and further submits that Mr. Boulton's quantification of the purported \"excess discount\" is \"unrealistic and unsupported.\"1408 The Respondent emphasizes that no academic literature supports the Claimant's theory that \"the Korea discount of a holding company like SC&T is the sum of the Korea discounts applicable to each of its parts.\"1409 Moreover, in response to Mr. Boulton's view that the risk of a predatory transaction dissipated upon the approval of the Merger, the Respondent argues that it is \"illogical\" for Mr. Boulton to assume that the market would have forgotten about the allegations of manipulation once the Merger was approved.1410\n\nRespondent's PHB, paras. 190-91.\n\nRespondent's Reply PHB, para. 89.\n\nRespondent's Reply PHB, para. 90(b).\n\nRespondent's Reply PHB, para. 91.\n\n**(a) The \"intrinsic value\"/SOTP approach**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n848.\n\nThe Respondent submits that an assessment of an \"intrinsic value\" in the context of a valuation based on the SOTP approach is not a reliable method of determining the FMV of the SC&T shares.1411\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 589; Rejoinder, para. 499.\n\n849.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that the concept of \"intrinsic value\" should be distinguished from the concept of FMV. The Respondent points to the literature Mr. Boulton himself cited to define \"intrinsic value,\" which indicates that FMV and \"intrinsic value\" are \"each distinct \u2013 and alternative \u2013 standards of value.\"1412\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 155.\n\n850.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that Mr. Boulton's testimony to the effect that the \"market price at the valuation date is not reliable, because it embeds the risk of [the Merger]\" is \"analytically flawed.\"1413 The Respondent submits that the market price on the valuation date rightly reflected the risk of the Merger. According to the Respondent, in the relevant but-for scenario, where the ROK did not cause the NPS to vote in favor of the Merger, \"the risk of the Merger would necessarily still be embedded in SC&T's share price on 16 July 2015, because that risk was created by Samsung, not the ROK's alleged treaty breach, and so is not removed for the purposes of the counterfactual.\"1414\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 159, *citing* Hearing Transcript, Day 7, p. 72:16-19.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 159.\n\n851.\n\nThird, the Respondent claims that any discrepancy between SC&T's market value and its \"intrinsic value\" is due to subjectivity in \"intrinsic value.\"1415 The Respondent submits that the Claimant and Mr. Boulton fail to explain why Mr. Boulton's \"own individual view must override the views of thousands of institutional investors and professional advisors, all of whom had the same basic information about SC&T on which he relies.\"1416\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 167.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 164.\n\n**(b) Discounts applicable to the SOTP valuation**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n852.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal should apply a \"common sense\" or \"suitable\" discount to determine SC&T's FMV if the Tribunal accepts the Claimant's SOTP valuation.1417\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 210.\n\n853.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent notes that the Parties agree that holding company discounts exist in the ROK and are applicable to the SOTP valuation of both SC&T and Cheil.1418\n\nRejoinder, para. 488(b), (e); Second Boulton Report, para. 2.5.7(I) (**CER-5**); Second Dow Report, para. 70(d) (**RER-3**).\n\n854.\n\nIn addition to the holding company discount, Professor Dow suggests that a \"Korea discount\" applies to Korean companies relative to their counterparts in more developed economies \u2013 regardless of whether or not the Korean company is part of a business group \u2013 due to political instability on the Korean peninsula, weak corporate governance practices largely based on circular-shareholding structures, and the tendency of Korean firms not to prioritize dividend payments.1419 In this respect, the Respondent highlights that Professors Dow, Bae, and Milhaupt all agree that the tunneling transactions by which controlling families benefit their private interests at the expense of minority investors contribute to the Korea discount.1420\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 604; First Dow Report, paras. 154-55, 158 (**RER-1**); Second Dow Report, para. 22 (**RER-3**).\n\nRejoinder, para. 489, *referring to* Second Dow Report, para. 71 (**RER-3**).\n\n855.\n\nProfessor Dow explains that such a discount \"is standard in the circumstances and applies generally to other holding companies in the Korean context, so as to create the illusion of a gap between EALP's proceeds from selling its shares and the supposed 'intrinsic value'.\"1421 Therefore, according to Professor Dow, a \"proper economic analysis shows that no such gap existed.\"1422\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 604, *citing* First Dow Report, para. 165 (**RER-1**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 604*, citing* First Dow Report, para. 165 (**RER-1**).\n\n856.\n\nProfessor Dow cites to the academic literature discussing what is termed a \"holding company discount puzzle,\" which predicts that discounts to NAV are persistent and can arise in many circumstances, including within Korean *chaebols*.\"1423\n\nFirst Dow Report, para. 146 (**RER-1**).\n\n857.\n\nProfessor Dow also refers to academic literature suggesting that large and persistent holding company discounts (ranging from a \"rule of thumb\" of 30-40% up to 60%) have applied to the NAVs of Korean *chaebols* for decades.1424 Market analysts allegedly identified discounts to NAV on the value of SC&T's listed investments ranging from 24.2% to 50% based *inter alia* on the NAV discounts applicable to other *chaebols* such as LG and SK Holdings.1425\n\nFirst Dow Report, paras. 149-50, 152, 164, Table 6, and Figure 15 (**RER-1**). *See also* Statement of Defence, para. 631. In his survey of the related academic literature, Professor Dow notes that similar holding company discounts have been identified in other countries and that there are related NAV discounts that apply to parent companies and within the closed-end mutual fund industry. *See* First Dow Report, paras. 149, 151 (**RER-1**).\n\nFirst Dow Report, paras. 147, 162-64, Table 6, and Figure 15 (**RER-1**).\n\n858.\n\nProfessor Dow suggests that Mr. Boulton's damages estimates are inflated as a result of his assuming an \"unrealistically low\" holding-company discount range of 5% to 15%.1426 Professor Dow submits that these estimates are significantly lower than the discounts that can be inferred from EALP's own models (32.8% to 44.6%),1427 EALP's trading plans (20.0% to 27.5%),1428 or the discounts Mr. Boulton calculates for his sample of holding companies (with a median of 39.3% and mean of 43.2%),1429 each of which would further lower the value of SC&T's shares in the but-for scenario and therefore reduce the quantum of damages asserted.1430\n\nSecond Dow Report, para. 45 (**RER-3**).\n\nSecond Dow Report, paras. 46(b), 184(a), and Figure 7 (**RER-3**), *referring to* Second Smith Statement, paras. 17, 21 (**CWS-5**); 'Historical' tab of EALP Model (**C-395**). Professor Dow also observed that between July 2007 and November 2014 (during which period Mr. Smith has testified EALP did not expect a merger between Cheil and SC&T), EALP believed SC&T traded between 34.3% discount and 25.8% premium, for an average of 16% discount to intrinsic value.

yet taking it into account would have at most a *de minimis* impact on the share price, as Professor Dow showed.1479 Even so, the Respondent considers this adjustment inappropriate as the Korean courts have confirmed that the timing of the announcement of the Qatar contract did not amount to a manipulation.1480\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 136.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 149. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 8: pp. 222:4-21.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 150(b), *referring to* Hearing Transcript, Day 8, p. 222:17-21. *See also* First Dow Report, para. 115 (**RER-1**);

Respondent's Reply PHB, para. 79.\n\n***2. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n881.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, \"[t]o quantify the Claimant's damages, it is necessary to perform valuation analysis rather than simply use traded share.\"1482 In the Claimant's view, SC&T's listed share price cannot be relied upon as an indicator of value including because of the alleged price manipulation and tunneling transactions, which were concealed from the market.1483\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 190.\n\nReply, para. 558(c), 587, 591; Milhaupt Report, paras. 61-62, 89 (**CER-6**).\n\n**(a) The stock market price as indicator of FMV**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n882.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the observable share price, used as a \"proxy\" for \"fair market value\" by the Respondent and its expert Professor Dow, did not reflect the intrinsic value of SC&T shares.1484 The Claimant submits that \"[t]he Merger was proposed and concluded using the Merger Ratio, which was based on share prices that purposely overvalued Cheil and undervalued SC&T and incorporated the threat of a predatory merger;\" therefore, the market price of SC&T shares did not come close to reflecting their true value.1485\n\nReply, paras. 536, 558(b), 568.\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 192(a).\n\n883.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that it is inappropriate to use market prices to value damages in a case where the asserted loss results from allegedly distorted share prices that undervalued SC&T and overvalued Cheil; according to the Claimant, \"the mechanism that caused the loss cannot logically be the measure of the loss.\"1486\n\nReply, paras. 569-70; Second Boulton Report, para. 2.2.11 and Appendix 4-2 (**CER-5**).\n\n884.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that, as the fluctuation of the holding company discount observed in Professor Dow's presentation indicates, \"general governance factors and associated factors applicable to holding companies in Korea cannot fully explain the observed discount between the SOTP/intrinsic value and the market price of SC&T shares prior to the Merger.\"1487\n\nClaimant's PHB, paras. 207-08, *referring to* Professor Dow's presentation material, slide 33.\n\n885.\n\nThe Claimant further points to the testimony of Mr. [REDACTED], of the accounting firm Deloitte Anjin, to the ROK's prosecutors to the effect that Deloitte changed the valuation of Cheil and SC&T seventeen times in order to make it aligned with the Merger Ratio that Samsung had \"pre-determined.\"1488 The Claimant argues that the evidence shows that \"contemporaneous market participants, including Deloitte, which ha[d] been hired by SC&T to provide the company's valuation for the Merger, did not believe that SC&T share price was an accurate measure of its value.\"1489\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 196.\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 197.\n\n886.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, therefore, \"it is self-evidently impossible to use the traded share price of SC&T as the sole metric for performing that calculation.\"1490\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 192(c).\n\n**(b) Effect of the rejection of the Merger on the stock market price in the but-for scenario**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n887.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, in the Claimant's favored but-for scenario, the Merger would have been rejected, and the market price of SC&T's share \"would, in all probability\" have instantaneously converged upon its \"intrinsic value.\"1491 According to Mr. Boulton, SC&T's listed price would have increased and Cheil's listed price would have decreased, but the listed prices of both companies would have continued to reflect a holding company discount of 5% to 15%.1492\n\nSecond Boulton Report, paras. 2.4.4, 2.8.2 (**CER-5**);

specifically, SC&T shareholders were made to forfeit the 'discount' portion of SC&T's value as a result of the Merger.\"1495\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 192(a).\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 192(a).\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 192(a), *referring to* First Boulton Report, para. 2.1.2 (**CER-3)**; Second Boulton Report para. 2.6.10 (**CER-5**).\n\n889.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the Respondent's theory that any impact of the alleged manipulation could be eliminated by a minor adjustment to SC&T's market price is not sufficient to correct the \"fundamental deficiency.\"1496\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 70.\n\n890.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[t]he evidence before this Tribunal shows that 'share price manipulation' of the sort that is currently being prosecuted by the ROK was but one of the reasons why the SC&T share price did not reflect SC&T's value \u2013 one aspect of the wider succession scheme.\"1497 Further, the Claimant argues that \"[s]imply adjusting for a single instance of share price manipulation, as the ROK proposes, would fail to capture the full extent to which the predatory Merger was causing a discount to SC&T's share price relative to its intrinsic value.\"1498 The Claimant also submits that Professor Dow has not provided the Tribunal with a quantification of the appropriate adjustments; therefore, the Tribunal should not adopt this theory.1499\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 71.\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 71.\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 72.\n\n891.\n\nThe Claimant further rejects the Respondent's proposition that the FMV of SC&T's shares can be valued by reference to the market price on 10 or 16 July 2015.1500 In this regard, the Claimant asserts that the market price of the SC&T share was unreliable because of price manipulation and so-called tunneling transactions allegedly undertaken by Samsung and the Lee family.1501\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 59.\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 61.\n\n892.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that any pre-Merger share price is inconsistent with the relevant but-for scenario. The Claimant submits that the pre-vote share prices on both 10 and 16 July 2015 would include \"some market uncertainty\" about the outcome of the vote that was scheduled for 17 July 2015; therefore, those pre-vote share prices cannot reflect what the price would have been in the but-for scenario \"where, after that vote, the risk of the predatory Merger had certainly disappeared.\"1502\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 64.\n\n**C. Profits from Cheil Swaps and Mitigation of Loss**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) Profits from Cheil Swaps**\n--------------------------------\n\n893.\n\nThe Claimant confirms that Elliott made KRW 49.5 billion of a trading gain through the Cheil short swaps.1503 The Claimant submits that \"Elliott occasionally seeks to make profits by taking a 'short' position in a security that it considers to be overvalued,\" and \"Elliott's short swaps in Cheil were an example of this.\"1504\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 241.\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 239.\n\n894.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that \"the Cheil short swaps exposed Elliott to the same risk in respect of the outcome of the Merger as the SC&T shares did.\"1505 In this regard, the Claimant contends that Professor Dow accepted that \"[t]he Cheil short swaps were not an offsetting bet to offer protection against the Claimant's position in SC&T.\"1506\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 240.\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 240, *referring to* Professor Dow's presentation material, slide 11.\n\n895.\n\nThe Claimant seeks to clarify that, in the present proceedings, it is not claiming \"for the gains it would have made on the Cheil short swaps;\"1507 therefore, any amount of profits made out of the Cheil short swaps should not be subtracted from the Claimant's claimed damages.1508\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 239.\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 242.\n\n**(b) Mitigation of Loss**\n--------------------------\n\n896.\n\nThe Claimant suggests that, after the Merger, \"EALP mitigated its loss and exited from its investment in SC&T\" by \"exercis[ing] its rights to require SC&T to buy-back 7,732,779 of its shares in SC&T\" in accordance with its rights under Korean law1509 and by selling its remaining 1,187,902 shares in the merged entity \"before the market price could fall further and exacerbate its losses.\"1510\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 255, *referring to* SH Lee Report, paras. 67-69 (**CER-2**) (explaining that under Korean law, within 20 days of an EGM approving a merger, a dissenting shareholder may demand that the company buy back that shareholder's shares).\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, paras. 260, 263; Reply, para. 601; First Smith Statement, para. 62 (**CWS-1**).\n\n897.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it only entered into a confidential settlement in March 2016 while an appeal was pending in the appraisal litigation, because the Respondent's Korean Securities Depositary would not reveal the minimum amount to which EALP was entitled under the statutory appraisal price formula and because \"approximately US$ 400 million of its investors' funds [were] tied up in this process.\"1511\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 259.\n\n898.\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Boulton states that EALP sought to mitigate damages by purchasing additional SC&T shares \"following rumours of the potential Merger\" to strengthen its voting power with the aim of blocking the Merger.1512\n\nSecond Boulton Report, para. 9.3.3 (**CER-5**).\n\n899.\n\nThe Claimant dismisses the Respondent's argument that EALP could have invested in other Korean holding companies with large and persistent holding company discounts, such as LG Corporation or SK Holdings.1513 Requiring the Claimant to seek alternative investment opportunities in Korea \u2013 particularly after the Claimant alleges it was harmed by the Korean government's conduct \u2013 would go \"well beyond\" the Claimant's burden of acting in reasonable mitigation when confronted by the alleged losses.1514 Furthermore, with respect to the Respondent's proposed alternative investments, the Claimant objects that its active pursuit of value in SC&T was not based on a \"cookie-cutter strategy\" and could not have been readily replicated with other holding companies.1515\n\nReply, para. 602; Second Boulton Report (**CER-5**).\n\nReply, paras. 603, 607.\n\nReply, para. 608.\n\n900.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of showing that the Claimant failed to mitigate avoidable loss.1516 Once the Merger was approved, the Claimant suggests, the difference between the \"intrinsic value\" of its investment and the Merger Ratio price had been permanently and irrevocably transferred to Cheil's shareholders.1517\n\nReply, paras. 603-04.\n\nReply, para. 605.\n\n***2. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n**(a) Profits from Cheil Swaps**\n--------------------------------\n\n901.\n\nBased on Professor Dow's calculations, the Respondent contends that the amount of profit the Claimant gained through the Cheil swaps is KRW 51.7 billion, instead of KRW 49.5 billion as asserted by the Claimant.1518\n\nRespondent's Reply PHB, para. 60.\n\n902.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the amount of profit the Claimant gained through the Cheil swap transactions must be deducted from the amount of damages to be awarded to the Claimant. The Respondent states that \"[s]ince EALP's profits on its SC&T and Cheil swap transactions in fact amounted to KRW 51.7 billion, and EALP's trading losses on its SC&T shares amounted to KRW 49.2 billion (using the before-tax amounts at which the shares were sold), EALP made a profit of KRW 2.5 billion.\"1519 The Claimant concludes that the Claimant \"thus suffered no damages from the Merger's approval.\"1520\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 120.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 120.\n\n**(b) Mitigation of Loss**\n--------------------------\n\n903.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant had opportunities to mitigate its alleged losses by investing in \"another of several Korean *chaebols* that arguably displayed the same discount\" to their putative \"intrinsic value.\"1521 The Respondent rejects arguments about the non-replicability of EALP's approach to spotting and actively pursuing a supposed discount in SC&T,1522 arguing that the \"'intrinsic value' approach necessarily is not specific to [SC&T], but, if correct, must apply to all of the many Korean *chaebols* and similar corporate groups that arguably trade at a discount to their NAV.\"1523\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 607, *referring to* First Dow Report, Section V.A.

Proceeds from Settlement Agreement with SC&T**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n904.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant is entitled to receive compensation from SC&T under the Settlement Agreement. The Tribunal should deduct, from any damages awarded to the Claimant, the relevant amount the Claimant receives from SC&T.1524\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 232; Respondent's Reply PHB, para. 96.\n\n905.\n\nIn this regard, in its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent specifically requests that \"the Tribunal order that the Claimant shall, within 30 days of it or any Elliott Group entity receiving a 'Top Up Payment' under the Settlement Agreement, pay an amount equivalent to the 'Top Up Payment' to the ROK.\"1525\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 236.\n\n***2. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n906.\n\nThe Claimant states in its Reply Post-Hearing Brief that, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement with SC&T, on 12 May 2022 it received a \"Top-Up Payment\" from SC&T of KRW 65,902,634,943, net of withholding and other taxes. The Claimant notes that it has accordingly updated its damages claim by deducting that amount from the principal amount.1526\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 102.\n\n907.\n\nTherefore, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's request for relief that was newly added with its Post-Hearing Brief is unnecessary and should be dismissed.\n\n**E. Quantification of Loss**\n-----------------------------\n\n***1. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n908.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimant submits that the appropriate valuation date for the SC&T share is 16 July 2015, the day before the shareholders' vote for the Merger.1527 According to the Claimant, this is \"the day the Claimant's investment still incorporated an intrinsic value that would have been released if the Merger was voted down the next day,\" and it is also \"the day before SC&T's intrinsic value was permanently lost as soon as the Merger at the confiscatory Merger Ratio was approved, thereby accomplishing the ROK's corrupt scheme.\"1528\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 264(a).\n\nClaimant's PHB, para 13; Milhaupt Report, para. 75 (**CER-6**).\n\n909.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Claimant seeks a principal amount of up to USD 408,253,247 (equivalent to KRW 517,363 million) in damages, which is the difference between:1529\n\n(a) the \"intrinsic value\" of the 7.12% of SC&T shares held by the Claimant on 16 July 2015, less a 5% holding company discount resulting in KRW 1,091,261 million;1530 and\n\n(b) the amount of KRW 65,902,634,943 that the Claimant has received from the sale of its 7,732,779 putback shares through the Settlement Agreement and the disposal of its 1,187,902 shares in New SC&T.1531\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, paras. 102, 106(b).\n\nSecond Boulton Report, para. 10.1.2(I), 10.3.1(I), 10.3.2, and Figure 27 (**CER-5**). Mr. Boulton calculates SC&T's SOTP value as KRW 18,510,678 million as of 16 July 2015. Second Boulton Report, Figure 3 (**CER-5**). For comparative purposes, as of 30 June 2015, EALP's own estimate of SC&T's NAV was approximately 15,004,075 million or 23.4% lower than the valuation in Mr. Boulton's second report. *See* Elliott SC&T NAV Analysis, 30 June 2015 (**C-395**).\n\nReply, paras. 557, 590; Claimant's Reply PHB, para. 102. *See* Second Boulton Report, paras. 2.6.7, 7.3.2-7.3.3, 10.1.2(II), 10.2.2(II), 10.2.4-10.2.7, 10.3.1(II), Figures 20 and 26 (**CER-5**).\n\n910.\n\nThe Claimant summarizes the quantification of its claim in the form of the following table:1532\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **KRW millions** | **US$** |\n| **5% holding company discount** |  |\n| Net loss to EALP (as at 12 May 2022) | 517,363 | 408,253,247 |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Pre-award interest (to 18 May 2022) | 261,850 | 206,633,357 |\n| **15%** | **holding company discount** |\n| Net loss to EALP | 388,979 | 306,950,089 |\n| Pre-award interest (to 18 May 2022) | 209,593 | 165,393,777 |\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 102.\n\n***2. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n911.\n\nAs noted above, it is the Respondent's primary position that the Claimant did not suffer any damage, instead it \"profited.\"1533 However, the Respondent submits, if the Tribunal awards damages despite the Claimant's trading profit, the total possible damages that can be sought by the Claimant amount to KRW 5,248 million, representing the difference between the KRW 61,400 share price on 2 March 2015 (\"the date before which EALP did not consider a Cheil/SC&T Merger to be plausible\"1534) and the actual sales price for the shares (for which Professor Dow uses the average putback settlement price of KRW 59,050) multiplied by the number of shares (2,233,011) owned on 2 March 2015.1535\n\nRespondent's Reply PHB, para. 64.\n\nSecond Dow Report, para. 54 (**RER-3**). Professor Dow notes that using a but-for date of 22 May 2015 would result in damages of KRW 21,583 million, but opines that \"this date is less plausible given EALP's many preemptive actions since early March 2015 to prepare for the possibility of a Merger between SC&T and Cheil.\" *See* Second Dow Report, para. 208, n. 66 (**RER-3**).\n\nSecond Dow Report, para. 207 (**RER-3**), *referring to* First Boulton Report, para. 6.2.8 (**CER-3**). Professor Dow excludes swaps from his damages calculation because only SC&T shareholders are entitled to dividends and votes on SC&T's corporate governance. *See* Second Dow Report, para. 209 (**RER-3**).\n\n**F. Currency of Award**\n------------------------\n\n***1. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n912.\n\nThe Claimant requests that it be compensated in U.S. Dollars, contending that it is commonplace for damages to be awarded in the Claimant's national currency to prevent exposure to currency risk between the alleged breach and the payment of damages.1536 Mr. Boulton calculates the Claimant's total losses (including pre-award interest) between KRW 602,591,041,703 to KRW 766,365,191,448, which he converts to USD 502,427,548 to USD 638,978,938 at the 30 June 2020 exchange rate.1537\n\nReply, para. 616.\n\nSecond Boulton Report, paras. 11.4.1-11.4.4, Appendices 11-1 and 11-2, Figures 29 and 30 (**CER-5**), *referring to* USD:KRW Exchange Rate on 30 June 2020 (**C-670**).\n\n***2. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n913.\n\nThe Respondent submits that any award rendered should be denominated in Korean Won because the Claimant invested in a South Korean company, bought and sold its shares in Korean Won, and denominated its damages calculations and proposed interest rates based on Korean Won.1538 Professor Dow observes that, contrary to the Claimant's own legal position, the Claimant's expert Mr. Boulton calculated damages and pre-award interest through 30 June 2020 in Korean Won and only then converted the amounts into U.S. Dollars at the then-prevailing exchange rate.1539\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 608-09; Rejoinder, para. 527. *See also* Second Dow Report, paras. 55, 215(b) (**RER-3**); First Dow Report, para. 173 (**RER-1**).\n\nSecond Dow Report, para. 213(b) (**RER-3**), *referring to* Second Boulton Report, para. 11.4.1 (**CER-5**).\n\n914.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that \"it is the Claimant that should bear any exchange rate risk for its investment made in KRW.\"1540\n\nRejoinder, para. 527, *referring to* Second Dow Report, para. 215 (**RER-3**).\n\n915.\n\nProfessor Dow adds that borrowing costs depend *inter alia* on the currency of the debt, meaning that \"[a]pplying an interest rate from one currency to a principal amount in another currency is a basic error of economics.\"1541\n\nSecond Dow Report, para. 215(a) (**RER-3**).\n\n**G. The Tribunal's Determination**\n-----------------------------------\n\n916.\n\nNeither the Treaty nor the UNCITRAL Rules provide any standards or guidance on the quantification of an MST claim, which is the only claim granted by the Tribunal. Accordingly, in accordance with Article 11.22.1, the Tribunal must determine the quantum of the Claimant's claims on the basis of the applicable rules of international law and the relevant expert and other evidence.\n\n917.\n\nThe relevant issues that the Tribunal must determine include (i) whether the Claimant has suffered any loss or damage as a result of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty; (ii) if the Claimant has shown that it suffered a loss, what is the appropriate method to value such loss; (iii) establishing the valuation date; and (iv) quantifying the amount of compensation. As these four issues are intertwined, the Tribunal will start with the second issue, the issue of methodology, because the answer to this question may also answer, at least in part, the first question; and also because this is also the order in which the Parties have approached the determination of quantum.\n\n918.\n\nAs to the valuation methodology, the Claimant's case is that the valuation of its loss should be based on the intrinsic value (rather than the market price) of the SC&T shares that it held prior to the approval of the Merger. The Respondent argues, in response, that the more reliable measure of value of the SC&T shares is their observable market price, which shows that the Claimant has not suffered any damage.\n\n919.\n\nAs summarized above, the Parties agree that, in principle, any compensation to which the Claimant may be entitled should be quantified as the difference between the FMV, or the fair market value, of the Claimant's shares in SC&T in the but-for scenario and the actual sales proceeds from the Claimant's sale of the SC&T shares it held, including the proceeds it received under the Settlement Agreement with SC&T. Nevertheless, they disagree virtually on all other issues relating to valuation and quantification, including on whether the Claimant's chosen method of valuation reflects the FMV of the Claimant's alleged loss, and indeed on whether the Claimant has suffered any loss.\n\n920.\n\nThe Claimant argues that its shares in SC&T should be valued on the basis of a SOTP (sum of the parts) methodology, in which each of the assets held by a company is valued separately, and the value of these assets are summed to arrive at a valuation of the company as a whole. This methodology produces the \"Net Asset Value,\" which the Claimant uses interchangeably as a synonym for \"intrinsic value.\" According to the Claimant, this is the proper valuation approach since the share price of SC&T cannot be relied upon, as it was depressed as a result of market manipulation. The depressed share price was eventually locked in by way of the Merger Ratio as a result of the Respondent's Treaty breach; and accordingly, the difference between the NAV of the shares the Claimant held in SC&T and the depressed share price locked in by the Merger Ratio, minus the sales proceeds, represents the Claimant's loss.\n\n921.\n\nThe Respondent argues, in turn, that the Claimant's speculative \"intrinsic value\" theory is subjective, inaccurate, and unreliable, and that the most reliable means of determining the FMV in this case is by reference to the market price, that is, SC&T's stock price.1542 According to the Respondent, \"intrinsic value\" is not a method of determining the FMV, but a different standard of value from the FMV altogether, and is defined by the American Society of Appraisers as a \"subjective value\" that \"will vary from analyst to the next.\"1543\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 589.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 155.\n\n922.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that both the share price and an SOTP analysis are valid methods of valuation, and indeed have been recognized as such by relevant professional bodies such as the American Society of Appraisers and are generally being used in practice by market participants when making investment decisions. Indeed, the SOTP method was used by the Claimant when making its decisions on the purchase of SC&T stock, and by other investors in SC&T, including the NPS.1544 While the SOTP methodology may be characterized as a more \"subjective\" valuation method than the market price, which is a reflection of the collective wisdom of the marketplace, it is applied on the basis of a professional valuer's expert opinion, and in this sense \"objectively.\" In the context of dispute-resolution proceedings such as the present arbitration, it will also be subject to testing by the counterparty and its experts, as well as questioning by the arbitral tribunal. Therefore, the issue here is not whether one or the other is a \"better\" or more \"reliable\" method of valuation in the abstract, but which one of the two methods is the more appropriate one in the circumstances of this case.\n\nFirst Smith Statement, pp. 4-5 (**CWS-1**); Second Boulton Report, para. 4.2.5 (**CER-5**); UBS, \"Samsung C&T Lacking catalysts; downgrade to Neutral,\" 27 April 2015 (**C-363**).\n\n923.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimant's case is that the SOTP methodology is more appropriate than market price in this case because the market price of SC&T is not a reliable measure of value as it was depressed as a result of market rumors, fears of a predatory merger, and manipulation by the Lee family, the controlling shareholders of the Samsung group, in an effort to establish a Merger Ratio as between SC&T and Cheil that favored Cheil's shareholders, including JY Lee, at the expense of SC&T's shareholders.1545 Indeed, according to the Claimant, the very purpose of the Merger was to transfer value from the shareholders of SC&T to those of Cheil.1546 The Claimant argues that the NPS's vote, which was critical for the Merger to proceed, therefore \"locked in\" and made permanent and irreversible the transfer of value from SC&T's shareholders to Cheil's shareholders and thus deprived the Claimant of the value of its investment in SC&T.1547 The compensation to be awarded should therefore be commensurate with this value transfer, while taking into account the Claimant's efforts to mitigate its loss by exercising its right under Korean law to require SC&T to buy-back its shares in SC&T, to the extent they were subject to a buy-back right.1548 The Claimant concludes that, since the manipulated share price was the \"mechanism\" by which the Lee family's strategy was achieved, and thus caused the Claimant's loss, it cannot logically be the measure of that loss.1549\n\nReply, para. 564; Claimant's PHB, paras. 56, 61.\n\nReply, para. 545.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, para. 262.\n\nSee para. 176 above. The Claimant sold its remaining 1,187,902 shares in SC&T (its 3,393,148 shares had been converted into 1,187,902 shares in the New SC&T).\n\nReply, para. 569.\n\n924.\n\nThe Claimant relies, *inter alia*, on the judgment of the Korean Supreme Court in the Appraisal Price Litigation,1550 in which the Court endorsed the lower court's conclusion that the share purchase price of SC&T must be determined on the basis of the market price as of 17 December 2014, the day before the listing of Cheil, as the market price of SC&T \"around the day before the date of the board resolution of this merger did not reflect the objective value of the former SC&T.\"1551 According to the Court, this was the case because \"the market share price of the former SC&T, then potentially a likely merger counterparty for Cheil, had been affected by this merger at least around the time of listing of Cheil.\"1552\n\nThe case was brought by former shareholders of SC&T who had opposed the Merger and rejected the share purchase price offered by the merged entity, calculated on the basis of the Capital Markets Act. Under Korean law, where a shareholder dissents from a board resolution regarding a merger, that shareholder may demand that the company purchase its shares. *See* Amended Statement of Claim, para. 244, *referring to* SH Lee Report, para. 67 (**CER-2**). Where the dissenting shareholder objects to the appraisal price determined in accordance with the Appraisal Price Formula, it may request that the Korean courts determine a new appraisal price. This was the purpose of the Appraisal Price Litigation.\n\nSupreme Court Case No. 2016Ma5394 (Consolidated), 14 April 2022, p. 6 (**C-782**).\n\nSupreme Court Case No. 2016Ma5394 (Consolidated), 14 April 2022, p. 9 (**C-782**).\n\n925.\n\nWhile the Parties agree that the share price of SC&T was depressed throughout the relevant period in the sense that it traded at a discount compared to its SOTP value for reasons such as the holding company discount and/or the \"Korea discount,\" they disagree on whether any market manipulation has in fact been proven. The Claimant's case that SC&T's share price was manipulated is based, *inter alia*, on the Samsung group's actions that allegedly depressed SC&T's share price and its alleged failure to disclose to the market certain developments which, if disclosed, would have resulted in an increase in SC&T's share price. These include failure to disclose a large transaction involving the Qatar Facility D IWPP (and certain other transactions) in a timely manner, the timing of announcement of Cheil subsidiary Samsung Biologics' listing on the NASDAQ, and other actions, including a \"frontloading\" of negative news involving SC&T, which would depress the SC&T share price.1553\n\nReply, para. 574.\n\n926.\n\nThe Respondent argues, in response, that the alleged market manipulation has not been proven and is still subject to pending criminal proceedings in Korea, that the instances of alleged market manipulation relied upon by the Claimant would have resulted only in a marginal, if any, increase in the share price of SC&T, and that in any event, the alleged market manipulation is not attributable to the Respondent.1554 According to the Respondent, one of the most \"fundamental flaws\" in the Claimant's damages claim is that the Respondent \"did not cause the harm of which the Claimant complains, even on the Claimant's own evidence.\"1555 The Respondent notes that Korean *chaebols* have for decades traded at prices below their NAVs, \"for perfectly good economic reasons,\" and if there was manipulation of SC&T's share price in terms of the timing of the Merger announcement and selecting the information that was provided to the market in the run-up to the announcement, it was not the Respondent that was responsible for it.1556\n\nRespondent's PHB, paras. 136-53.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 620.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 631, 634-36.\n\n927.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties that SC&T's shares were trading at a discount relative to the company's NAV, and that this was the case throughout the relevant period, from the date of listing of Cheil on 18 December 2014 (as there could not have been market manipulation as between the share prices of SC&T and Cheil before this date)1557 and the approval of the Merger on 17 July 2015 (or 13 July 2015, when the news about the NPS's vote on the Merger appears to have been leaked to the market; see below). The Tribunal further notes that this is also the period during which the Claimant purchased all of the SC&T's shares at issue in this arbitration.1558 The Claimant was therefore able to acquire its entire shareholding in SC&T at a discounted price (relative to SC&T's NAV).\n\nThe Claimant indicated at the hearing that the market manipulation would have started on 14 November 2014, when Samsung SDS was limited. Hearing Transcript, Day 9, pp. 79:10 \u2013 80:16. Accepting this date as the relevant start date does not affect the Tribunal's conclusions.\n\nSecond Smith Statement, para. 66(i) (**CWS-5**); Response provided to FSS by EALP (attaching trade confirmations), 18 September 2015 (**C-442**). The Tribunal notes that the alleged market manipulation is still subject to ongoing criminal proceedings in the ROK.\n\n928.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the Claimant does not appear to argue that the Respondent was responsible for the alleged market manipulation and depression of SC&T's share price (relative to its NAV, or intrinsic value).1559 The Claimant's case is rather that the approval of the Merger \u2013 which was procured by the Respondent by way of its intervention in the NPS's vote \u2013 locked in the Merger Ratio and thus rendered the transfer of value from SC&T's shareholders to Cheil shareholders irreversible. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to decide whether the SC&T's depressed share price was primarily the result of market manipulation rather than other factors, such as the \"tunneling\" risk in Korean *chaebols* (or the \"Korea discount\") or a more general holding company discount.\n\nIn its Reply PHB, the Claimant suggests that \"the wider succession scheme\" was \"one aspect\" of the alleged \"share price manipulation,\" but does not elaborate and appears to take the view that main cause of SC&T's depressed share price was the risk of a \"predatory Merger.\" Claimant's Reply PHB, para. 71.\n\n929.\n\nIt follows that, since SC&T's depressed share price in any event was not a result of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty, the period from the listing of Cheil on 18 December 2014 until the approval of the Merger on 17 July 2015, when SC&T's share price was depressed, cannot in its entirety form part of the counterfactual scenario where the Respondent did not breach the Treaty. The counterfactual must be the scenario where the Respondent did not breach the Treaty, *i.e.* where the NPS did not vote in favor of the Merger and thereby cause the approval of the Merger. The date of valuation of the Claimant's loss must therefore be determined by reference to this scenario.\n\n930.\n\nThe Claimant's position is that the valuation date should be the day before the Merger approval, *i.e.* 16 July 2015, whereas the Respondent argues that the \"best\" valuation date would be Friday, 10 July 2015, the date of the NPS's vote, as the outcome of the NPS's vote appears to have been leaked to the market on the first business date thereafter, that is, on Monday, 13 July 2015. Having considered the Parties' positions on this issue, and having reviewed the supporting evidence, the Tribunal is not convinced that 10 July 2015 should be the valuation date. While there appear to have been press reports citing reports about the outcome of the NPS's vote,1560 the Tribunal notes that the NPS refused to confirm its position before the EGM, and in any event, there was no significant reaction in the SC&T's share price on 13 July 2015.1561 This suggests that the market did not consider the information sufficiently reliable. Both Parties' experts also adopted 16 July 2015 as the valuation date. The Tribunal therefore considers that 16 July 2015 is the appropriate valuation date, as this is the day before the day when the effects of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty were felt in the market, as reflected in the value of the Claimant's shareholding in SC&T.\n\n\"NPS decides to vote yes to Samsung C&T \u2013 Cheil Industries Merger,\" YTN News, 11 July 2015 (**R-131**).\n\nSC&T's share price moved from KRW 64,400 on 10 July 2015 to 65,000 on 13 July 2015. *See* SC&T and Cheil Share Prices, 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, p. 11 (**C-256**).\n\n931.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimant argues that the valuation of the Claimant's investment, on the valuation date, should be based on SC&T's NAV rather than the share price because, but for the Respondent's breach, the share price would have reached the level of the NAV. According to the Claimant, the intrinsic value of its investment would have been \"released,\" and the share price of SC&T would have \"skyrocketed,\" had the Merger been rejected. While the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the approval of the Merger \"locked in\" the Merger Ratio that reflected the discount in SC&T's share price and thus irreversibly transferred value from SC&T's shareholders to Cheil's shareholders, it is unable to agree that the valuation of the Claimant's shareholding in SC&T should be based on the company's NAV rather than its share price. That is so for two reasons. First, as noted above, the discount in SC&T's share price was not a consequence of the Respondent's breach. Second, the Tribunal accepts, *as a possibility*, that in a counterfactual scenario in which the Merger had been rejected, the value of SC&T shares might have increased to narrow the gap between the pre-Merger market price of the shares and the total value of SC&T based on a SOTP valuation. Such a potential increase in value would represent, in the actual scenario, a corresponding potential loss for the Claimant. But for such potential loss to be compensable under international law, the Claimant would have had to demonstrate, under the principle of full compensation set forth in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, that the claimed increase in value would have occurred in \"all probability.\"1562 The Tribunal is not convinced by the evidence that the Claimant has made such a showing.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)*, Decision on the Merits, PCIJ Rep., Series A \u2013 No. 17, 13 September 1928, p. 47 (**CLA-97**).\n\n932.\n\nThe evidence before the Tribunal shows that while SC&T's share price did fall immediately after the approval of the Merger, from KRW 69,300 to KRW 62,110 (which is the reaction one would expect if the market considered that the rejection of the Merger would have released, at least in part, SC&T's intrinsic value), the market had previously reacted favorably to the Merger announcement itself, resulting in SC&T's share price rising by 14.83%, from KRW 55,300 to KRW 63,500. This suggests that the market's reaction to the Merger was at best mixed. While this does not exclude that SC&T's rise could have risen, even substantially, had the Merger been rejected, the Tribunal is not convinced that this would have happened overnight. It is a matter of speculation as to how high the share price would have risen, or how long this would have taken, or at what point in time any such increase of value should be definitively measured (before its level would start reflecting other, countervailing factors), and under international law speculative claims of value are generally not compensable.1563 The Tribunal is also not convinced by the evidence that the \"Korea discount\" that depressed SC&T's share price throughout the relevant period would have disappeared overnight, or even in the foreseeable future. The \"Korea discount\" reflects the tunneling risk (and related concerns over governance) inherent in all Korean *chaebols*, and even if the Merger had been rejected, this would not have resulted in a change of control over SC&T, which would have remained part of the Samsung *chaebol* and thus subject to the \"Korea discount.\" In the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the proper method of valuation of the Claimant's loss is market value, which may be quantified as the difference between SC&T's share price on the valuation date, 16 July 2015, and the price at which the Claimant subsequently disposed of its shareholding.\n\nILC Articles (with commentaries) (2001), Commentary to Article 36, para. 27 (**CLA-38**).\n\n933.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore determine whether the Claimant indeed disposed of its shareholding \u2013 its investment \u2013 in SC&T at a price that was lower than the value of its shareholding on the valuation date. This is a loss that the Claimant would have suffered as a result of the Respondent's breach, as it would indeed have \"locked in,\" or realized, the reduction in value of the Claimant's investment in SC&T as a result of approval of the Merger. This is therefore the relevant measure of value to which the Tribunal will now turn.\n\n934.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant acquired a total of 7,732,779 SC&T shares before the Merger announcement of 26 May 2015, and a total of 3,393,148 shares after the Merger announcement and the date of the shareholders' approval of the Merger on 17 July 2015, resulting in a total of 11,125,927 shares.1564 The former shares were subject to a reappraisal right under Korean law (the \"**Putback Shares**\"), and accordingly the Claimant (and other SC&T shareholders who objected to the Merger) had the right to require that those shares be repurchased from them, whereas no such reappraisal right attached to the 3,393,148 shares that the Claimant purchased after the Merger announcement.1565 The Claimant purchased the 7,732,779 Putback Shares during the period January to May 2015 at a total price of KRW 469.8 billion (at an average price of KRW 60,754 per share),1566 and the 3,393,148 shares to which it had no reappraisal rights, during the period from 28 May to 4 June 2015 at a total price of KRW 215.8 billion (at an average price of KRW 63,599 per share).1567 The Claimant's total investment in SC&T's shares thus amounted to KRW 685.6 billion.1568\n\nFirst Boulton Report, paras. 4.3.25, 4.4 (**CER-3**).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, based on the evidence before it, the price of SC&T stock appears to have fluctuated approximately between KRW 55,000 and 65,000 during the period from 18 December 2014, the date of Cheil's IPO, and the Merger announcement on 26 May 2015, and then fluctuating a substantially higher level, approximately between KRW 65,000 and 75,000, during the period between the Merger announcement and the date of the shareholders' approval of the Merger on 17 July 2015. *See* First Dow Report, para. 23 (**RER-1**); Second Boulton Report, Section 10 (**CER-5**).\n\nReply para. 553 (\"spent KRW 469.8 billion to acquire the Putback Shares and received into its account only KRW 402 billion via the Settlement Agreement, realizing a loss of approximately KRW 68 billion (approximately USD 56 million at today's exchange rates).\"). *See also* Second Smith Statement, para. 66(i) (**CWS-5**); Response provided to FSS by EALP (attaching trade confirmations), 18 September 2015 (**C-442**); Spreadsheet of EALP's shareholding in SC&T from 27 January to 4 June 2015 (**C-384**).\n\nSecond Smith Statement, para. 66(ii) (**CWS-5**); Response provided to FSS by EALP (attaching trade confirmations), 18 September 2015 (**C-442**).\n\nFourth Smith Statement, para. 18 (**CWS-7**).\n\n935.\n\nBy the valuation date of 16 July 2015, the value of the Claimant's shareholding in SC&T had increased to KRW 69,300 per share.1569 This translates into a total valuation of the Claimant's entire shareholding in SC&T (11,125,927 shares) of KRW 771,026,741,100, or approximately KRW 771 billion (KRW 535,881,584,700 for the 7,732,779 Putback Shares plus KRW 235,145,156,400 for the remaining 3,393,148 shares).\n\nSC&T and Cheil Share Prices, 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015, p. 11 (**C-256**).\n\n936.\n\nThe Claimant subsequently sold the Putback Shares which it had purchased before the Merger announcement and to which it had a reappraisal right (and which had been subsequently exchanged for 2,707,157 shares in New SC&T on 14 September 2015 as per the Merger Ratio) at a price of KRW 57,234 per share, plus a payment for delay, the total price per share amounting to KRW 59,050.1570 This amounts in total to KRW 456,620,599,950, or approximately KRW 456.6 billion or, net of tax KRW 402 billion.1571 The Tribunal considers that the pre-tax amount is the one to be taken into account, to ensure consistency; and indeed Mr. Boulton in his calculation of the Claimant's trading losses also took into account the pre-tax amounts.1572 Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, EALP subsequently received a \"Top Up Payment\" from SC&T, in the total amount of KRW 65,902,634,943.1573 The per share price of the Top Up Payment is not on record, but based on the number of shares (7,732,779) and the total amount of the Top Up Payment (KRW 65,902,634,943), it appears to be KRW 8,522.50 per share. When this is added to the amount already paid pursuant to the Settlement Agreement (KRW 59,050), the total sales price per share amounts to KRW 67,572.50, whereas the total for all 7,732,779 shares amounts KRW 522,523,208,978, or approximately KRW 522.5 billion. These amounts are below the value of the Claimant's shareholding in the Putback Shares as at the valuation date (KRW 69,300 per share and the total value of KRW 535,881,584,700), the loss per share therefore being KRW 1,727.50 and the Claimant's total loss for the Putback Shares being KRW 13,358,357,723, or approximately KRW 13.4 billion.\n\nFirst Boulton Report, para. 6.2.8 (**CER-3**).\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 117(a)-(c); Hearing Transcript, Day 6, p. 69:5-14.\n\nFirst Boulton Report, para. 10.2.6 (**CER-3**); Second Boulton Report, para. 10.2.6 (**CER-5**).\n\n*See* Claimant's Reply PHB, para. 102.\n\n937.\n\nThe Claimant also subsequently sold the shares which it had purchased after the Merger announcement and to which it had no appraisal rights (and which had been subsequently exchanged for 1,187,902 shares in New SC&T on 14 September 2015 as per the Merger Ratio). The Claimant sold its shares in New SC&T between 17 and 25 September 2015 at a price ranging between KRW 145,914 and 160,464, for a total of KRW 179,759,400,000, or approximately KRW 179.8 billion.1574 On the valuation date, the value of the Claimant's shareholding in these shares was KRW 235,145,156,400, or approximately KRW 235.1 billion. Thus the loss suffered by the Claimant amounts to KRW 55,385,756,400, or approximately KRW 55.39 billion.\n\n*See* First Boulton Report, para. 6.2.12 (**CER-3**); Second Boulton Report, para. 10.2.6 (**CER-5**). *See also* Reply, para 554, *referring to* Second Smith Statement, para. 66 (**CWS-5**); EALP, Records of SC&T Share Disposition, 15 September to 1 October 2015 (**C-672**); Spreadsheet of EALP's disposal of non-Putback shares in SC&T, 14 September to 1 October 2015 (**C-443**).\n\n938.\n\nThe Claimant's total loss on its entire stock of 11,125,927 shares it held on the valuation date of 16 July 2015 thus amounts to KRW 68,744,114,123, or approximately KRW 68.7 billion (KRW 13,358,357,723 for the Putback Shares + KRW 55,385,756,400 for the non-putback shares). Subject to the Tribunal's determination on the Respondent's remaining defense, relating to the offset of the profit allegedly made by the Claimant in short-selling its swaps on SC&T and Cheil, this is therefore the amount to which the Claimant is, in principle, entitled under the Treaty in compensation of the loss of value of its investment as a result of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty.\n\n939.\n\nAs to the remaining issue, there is no dispute between the Parties that the Claimant made a profit from its swap trades in Cheil and SC&T in 2015-2016. They disagree, however, on the amount of the profit made, the Claimant asserting that it made a profit of approximately KRW 49.5 billion, whereas the Respondent's expert, Professor Dow, calculated the profit at KRW 51.7 billion.1575 In view of its finding below, the Tribunal need not resolve this issue.\n\nRespondent's PHB, para. 116.\n\n940.\n\nThe Claimant argues that \"[t]he Cheil short swaps were not an offsetting bet to offer protection against the Claimant's position in SC&T.\"1576 In this connection, the Claimant notes that Professor Dow accepted at the hearing that \"the Cheil short swaps exposed Elliott to the same risk in respect of the outcome of the Merger as the SC&T shares did.\"1577\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 240.\n\nClaimant's PHB, para. 240.\n\n941.\n\nThe Respondent argues, in response, that the Claimant's trading profits on the swaps should be taken into account when quantifying the Claimant's trading losses. The Respondent contends that, when both trading in SC&T's shares (based on differentials between the prices at which the Claimant purchased the shares and the prices at which it subsequently disposed of them) and swaps referencing SC&T's and Cheil's shares are taken into account, the Claimant did not suffer any loss.\n\n942.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the valuation and quantification it has conducted above is not one relating to the Claimant's \"trading losses,\" but to the loss of value of its investment \u2013 shareholding \u2013 in SC&T, as a result of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty. Indeed, as noted above in Section III.B, while the Claimant engaged in the course of 2015 in extensive trading in total return swaps referencing SC&T's shares, from 29 January 2015 onwards it gradually increased its shareholding in SC&T by directly purchasing shares in addition to swaps. After the Merger announcement on 26 May 2015, the Claimant began to cross its swap positions into shareholding, and by 3 June 2015, it no longer held any swap positions in SC&T.1578 Accordingly, the Claimant did not hold any such swap positions on the valuation date, which by then had been converted into shareholdings. These swap positions therefore could not have offset the Claimant's loss on the value of its investment.\n\nSecond Smith Statement, Appendix A (**CWS-5**).\n\n943.\n\nAs for the short positions in Cheil that the Claimant held in the form of swaps, the Claimant states that it increased its positions before the Merger, including because such short positions were expected to generate a return following a failure of the Merger; and even if the Merger were approved, the short positions would \"offset some of the downward movement in the price of SC&T shares that was to be expected following their exchange ratio into overvalued New SC&T shares upon the consummation of the Merger.\"1579 The Claimant further explains that after the approval of the Merger, from 20 July 2015 onwards, it undertook arbitrage by way of investing in SC&T and Cheil swaps.1580 As of 14 September 2015, it focused on exiting these short positions, and fully exited from them by 21 January 2016. According to the Claimant, since the Cheil short swaps exposed Elliott to the same risk in relation to the outcome of the Merger as its shareholding in SC&T, they were not an offsetting bet to offer protection against the Claimant's position in SC&T. Since the Claimant is not claiming for any gains it would have made on the Cheil short swaps had the Merger been rejected, it argues that the profits made by the Claimant out of the Cheil short swaps should not be deducted from the Claimant's damages.\n\nFourth Smith Statement, paras. 9-10 (**CWS-7**).\n\nFourth Smith Statement, para. 14 (**CWS-7**).\n\n944.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the profits derived by the Claimant from the Cheil swaps should be deducted from any compensation to be awarded to the Claimant, as they form part of the Claimant's trading activities, which include the acquisition of its shareholdings in SC&T. As noted above, the Respondent also claims, based on Professor Dow's calculations, that the profit made by the Claimant from the Cheil short swaps amounts to KRW 51.7 billion, instead of the KRW 49.5 billion asserted by the Claimant.\n\n945.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' positions, the Tribunal accepts that the Cheil short swaps were initially set up to offer protection against the Claimant's position in SC&T and thus were exposed to the same risk in relation to the outcome of the Merger as its shareholding in SC&T, and therefore were not an \"offsetting\" bet. Moreover, even if they had been set up as an off-setting bet, they could not be legitimately considered to constitute an offsetting bet against the Respondent's intervention in the Merger since, as determined above in Section VI.C, this was not a commercial risk that the Claimant could reasonably anticipate when making its investment in SC&T. Consequently, the trading profits the Claimant made from the Cheil swaps during the period prior to 17 July 2015 should not be deducted from the amount of any compensation due to the Claimant.\n\n946.\n\nThese considerations do not apply, however, to the Claimant's shorting on Cheil swaps after 17 July 2015; these transactions can be considered as an attempt to mitigate damage. As Mr. Smith explained, \"[f]rom 16 July 2015, \u2026 we became more focused on the third function of the Cheil short positions [*i.e.* in the event that 'the Merger was approved, the Cheil swaps would offset some of the downward movement in the price of SC&T shares that was to be expected following their exchange into overvalued New SC&T shares upon the consummation of the Merger'], in case we would receive overvalued New SC&T shares in exchange for our SC&T shares (more than 30% of which did not benefit from any putback rights).\"1581\n\nFourth Smith Statement, paras. 11, 13 (**CWS-7**).\n\n947.\n\nThe remaining issue is the impact of this matter on quantum. As noted above, the Claimant takes the view that it made a profit of KRW 49.5 billion of a trading gain through the Cheil short swaps, whereas Professor Dow, the Respondent quantum expert, calculates that the profits amounted to KRW 51.7 billion. The Tribunal notes that both calculations include transactions entered into prior to the date of approval of the Merger. In view of the Tribunal's findings above, these transactions should be excluded from any considerations of quantum. As to the remaining transactions, it appears from the evidence that the Claimant in fact made a loss on the New SC&T/Cheil short transactions which it entered into after the Merger.1582 Accordingly, there is no basis to make any deductions from the compensation to be awarded to the Claimant.\n\nElliott Fund positions in Cheil, May-July 2015 (**R-325**); Spreadsheet of Elliott's swap holdings in Cheil from 27 July 2015 to 21 January 2016 (**C-750**); Spreadsheet of Elliott's swap holdings in SC&T from 21 July 2015 to 14 September 2015 (**C-760**).\n\n948.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimant's loss of value of its investment as a result of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty amounts to KRW 68,744,114,123.\n\n949.\n\nThe only remaining issue is the currency of the award. As summarized above, the Parties disagree on whether the award should be made in KRW or USD.\n\n950.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither Party has cited any provision of the Treaty or any rule of international law that would exclude or limit the Claimant's right to claim that the payment of any compensation as a result of a Treaty breach be made in its own currency, even it had been quantified in the currency of the host State. As noted by the Claimant, \"it is entirely commonplace for damages to be awarded in the currency of the Claimant's nationality.\"1583\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 916, *citing* S. Ripinsky and K. Williams, Damages in International Investment Law (2006), p. 394 (**CLA-157**).\n\n951.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that according to Article 11.6(2) (\"Expropriation and Compensation\") of the Treaty, which provides useful guidance more generally, \"[e]ach Party shall permit transfers relating to a covered investment to be made in a freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing at the time of transfer.\"1584 Article 11.7(1)(d) (\"Transfers\") further specifically provides that \"payments arising out of a dispute\" qualify as \"transfers relating to a covered investment.\" Annex 11-G of the Treaty, which also deals with \"Transfers,\" makes clear that any measures available under the Korean Foreign Exchange Transactions Act do not apply to \"payments or transfers associated with foreign direct investment.\" Footnote 3 to Article 11.7 further confirms that \"[f]or greater certainty, Annex 11-G applies to this Article.\"\n\nThe Tribunal understands that, like the U.S. Dollar, the Korean Won is a freely convertible (\"usable\") currency. However, this is not determinative of the question of whether the Claimant may claim payment in U.S. Dollars.\n\n952.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Treaty cannot be read so as to limit the Claimant's right to claim that the payment of any compensation under the Treaty be made in U.S. Dollars. The Tribunal considers that the appropriate date of conversion from KRW to USD is the date of this Award. Accordingly, the amount of the Award is USD 53,586,931.00.1585\n\nThe Tribunal has used the KRW to USD exchange rate from OANDA. On the date of the Award, the exchange rate was KRW 1,000 : USD 0.77951. *See* OANDA's Currency Converter, https://www.oanda.com/currency-converter/.\n\n**IX. INTEREST**\n----------------\n\n953.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is entitled to pre- and post-Award interest based on the statutory interest rate applicable in the Republic of Korea.\n\n954.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees, arguing that the award of interest in the context of this international arbitration should follow the standards of international law, rather than the domestic rate that might be applied in domestic court proceedings.\n\n**A. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n955.\n\nThe Claimant seeks pre-award interest at 5%, the standard Korean commercial judgment rate, compounded monthly from the valuation date (16 July 2015) to 30 June 2020.1586 The Claimant suggests that this rate is an \"objective benchmark\" to guide the Tribunal's \"wide discretion to determine the rate and basis of interest.\"1587 The Claimant argues that neither a risk-free rate nor Korea's borrowing rate would accomplish full compensation.1588 According to the Claimant, the full compensation principle requires making the Claimant whole for its opportunity cost.1589 The Claimant points to its average annualized return of [REDACTED] between the valuation date and 31 March 2020.1590\n\nSecond Boulton Report, paras. 11.2.1-11.3.3 and Figure 28 (**CER-5**); First Boulton Report, paras. 1.6.2, 7.2.1 (**CER-3**); Reply, para. 611.\n\nReply, paras. 610-11.\n\nReply, para. 612, n. 1750.\n\nReply, para. 613.\n\nReply, paras. 613-14.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n956.\n\nThe Respondent argues that a 5% interest rate, compounded monthly, is excessive and unjustified, compensating the Claimant \"for risk it did not bear.\"1591 The Respondent contends that there is no basis for applying the Korean commercial judgment rate in an arbitration governed by international law principles of full compensation.1592 The Respondent asserts that according to the Claimant's own authorities, \"the trend in investment disputes has been for tribunals to award interest at market savings or lending rates, such as the U.S. T-bill rate or the LIBOR rate\" to give effect to principle of full reparation.1593 The Respondent considers that regardless of the rate used, there is no basis for monthly compounding.1594 The Respondent therefore submits that the most appropriate interest rate is Korea's borrowing cost of approximately 2.1% (compounded annually), which would appropriately compensate the Claimant for the time value of money under either the risk-free or forced loan views of pre-award interest.1595\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 608; Rejoinder, para. 526; First Dow Report, para. 40(b) (**RER-1**); Second Dow Report, paras. 55, 210, 214(b) (**RER-3**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 608-09; Rejoinder, para. 523.\n\nRejoinder, para. 524.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 609; First Dow Report, para. 171 (**RER-1**).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 608.

The Tribunal's Determination**\n-----------------------------------\n\n958.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, although the Treaty deals with interest payable on compensation for expropriation, it remains silent on interest payable on any compensation awarded as a result of a breach of the MST. In the circumstances, the Tribunal has discretion to determine the appropriate interest rate, taking into account any relevant rules of international law, the Parties' argument and evidence, as well as international arbitral practice.\n\n959.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties that the Claimant is entitled to both pre-award and post-award interest.\n\n960.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimant's case is that it is entitled to recover pre-award interest at the rate of 5%, the standard Korean commercial judgment rate, compounded monthly from 16 July 2015, as well as post-award interest at the same rate, also compounded monthly. The Respondent argues in response, relying on Professor Dow's evidence, that the appropriate interest rate is either the simple risk-free rate or the borrowing rate of the ROK. According to the Respondent, there is no basis for applying the Korean court interest rate in an international arbitration proceeding such as the present one.\n\n961.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in Section VIII.G above that the Claimant is entitled to payment of compensation awarded in U.S. Dollars; however, since the Claimant incurred and has quantified its losses in Korean Won, the appropriate date of conversion must be the date of the Award and not any earlier date. The currency to which the pre-award interest is applicable is therefore Korean Won. Having considered the Parties' positions and the evidence before it, including arbitral practice dealing with awards of interest, the Tribunal finds that the determination of the applicable interest rate should be based on the principle that the Claimant must be made whole and accordingly must be entitled to compensation based on what it would have obtained had it invested the funds corresponding to the amount of compensation during the period when it was deprived of such funds. In the circumstances, and in the absence of any evidence relating to relevant market savings or lending rates, the Tribunal determines that the applicable interest rate should be 5%, in accordance with the standard Korean commercial judgment rate. The Tribunal considers it appropriate that the interest accrued should be compounded yearly from 16 July 2015 until the date of this Award.\n\n962.\n\nAs for the post-award interest, since the Award is made in U.S. Dollars, the applicable interest rate should, in principle, reflect this currency. However, in the absence of any evidence before the Tribunal relating to relevant market savings or lending rates applicable or relevant to U.S. Dollar amounts, the Tribunal determines that the appropriate interest rate is 5%, applicable as of the date of this Award, and compounded yearly from the date of the Award until the date of payment.1598\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this rate is reasonably close to a potentially applicable market rate, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), which on the date of the Award stood at 5.06%. *See* Federal Reserve Bank of New York, http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/sofr.\n\n**X. COSTS**\n------------\n\n963.\n\nAccording to Article 11.26.2 of the Treaty, \"[a] tribunal may \u2026 award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules.\"1599\n\nTreaty, Art. 11.26 (**C-1**).\n\n964.\n\nArticle 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules further provides:\n\n1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award, or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\n\n965.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL provides, in relevant part:\n\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\n\n2. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n**A. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n966.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is entitled to full reimbursement of the costs of this arbitration, including compound interest on the Tribunal's award of costs, as the prevailing party pursuant to the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Rules, and the principle of full reparation under customary international law.1600 The Claimant further asserts that its costs are reasonable in the \"circumstances of the case.\"1601\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 1, 51.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 21.\n\n***1. Alocation of Costs***\n---------------------------\n\n967.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it should be considered the prevailing party in this arbitration for purposes of awarding costs because, according to the Claimant, \"[it] has proved that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute, that the ROK's measures breached the Treaty, and those breaches caused the Claimant's loss.\"1602 The Claimant further recalls that it has been the successful party on the various procedural issues that the Tribunal has decided during these proceedings.1603\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 17-18.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 19.\n\n968.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant submits that it is entitled under the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Rules, and the principle of full reparation to recover its costs in full, consistent with a long line of authorities.1604 Conversely, an award that fails to compensate a successful litigant for the costs it reasonably incurred in pursuing its claim, the Claimant asserts, falls short of the international law standard.1605\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 8, 10, 20, *referring to* *Libananco Holdings Co.

Reasonableness of Costs***\n--------------------------------\n\n970.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the costs incurred in this arbitration are reasonable for the following reasons.1608\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 21.\n\n971.\n\nFirst, noting that \"this arbitration arises from one of the most significant corruption scandals to have rocked the ROK in its history,\" the Claimant argues that extensive briefing was necessary in the context of the serious allegations made and the size of the loss that the Claimant suffered.1609 The Claimant adds that the appointments of senior and experienced counsel by both sides, as well as voluminous fact, expert, and documentary evidence advanced by both Parties, demonstrate the importance and complexity of this case.1610\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 24.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 22-23.\n\n972.\n\nSecond, the Claimant asserts that considerable costs were incurred in its extensive and expensive fact-gathering exercise as part of its groundwork to ensure the merit of its claims.1611 Specifically, the Claimant stresses that lawyers and [REDACTED] at Kobre & Kim from March 2017 had to attend as many sessions as possible of the public hearings of the criminal proceedings against President Park, Minister Moon and CIO Hong, and JY Lee for several years.1612 The Claimant further explains that it had to engage external service providers who, alongside Kobre & Kim, monitored the relevant Korean press coverage, prepared and translated the media updates.1613 According to the Claimant, such preparatory work was necessary to enable the Claimant to determine whether there was sufficient evidence of the ROK's governmental wrongdoing to bring a claim under the Treaty within the applicable time limit.1614\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 28.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 30.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 31, 40.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 34.\n\n973.\n\nThe Claimant further underscores that it was through this extensive groundwork that it was able to make \"narrow, targeted, and specific document requests for court transcripts, statements to prosecutors, and documents that had been directly mentioned in open court,\" and as a result, \"the highly reliable evidence from the Korean criminal proceedings came into the record of this arbitration with the Claimant's Statement of Reply.\"1615 The Claimant submits that the overall development of its factual case, including document production and review, represents approximately 30-35% of the fees incurred by Kobre & Kim.1616\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 35-36, 39.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 32-34.\n\n974.\n\nThird, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's conduct unnecessarily increased the Claimant's costs by:\n\n(a) Unsuccessfully seeking to deprive the Claimant of the right to file an Amended Statement of Claim and a Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections;1617\n\n(b) Raising \"meritless\" preliminary objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, two of which were ultimately abandoned by the end of the Respondent's briefing;1618\n\n(c) Avoiding to produce responsive document that were in the ROK's possession, custody and control until the Claimant \"chased it\" by way of *inter partes* correspondence and application to the Tribunal for further orders;1619\n\n(d) Producing responsive documents that the Claimant had long requested on the day the Parties were due to file their first post-hearing briefs and, as a result, delaying the filing of the post-hearing submissions by six weeks;1620\n\n(e) Contesting the merits of this in case, including the evidentiary value of an indictment by its own PPO, even though the same evidence led to the conviction and incarceration of the ROK government officials relevant to this arbitration;1621 and\n\n(f) Insisting to cross examine Kobre & Kim [REDACTED] even after their handwritten notes were confirmed through document production to be highly accurate reflections of the in-court testimony they had heard.1622\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para.

39.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 38.\n\n975.\n\nFinally, the Claimant avers that procedural and logistical challenges that arose during the proceedings, including the Treaty's requirement to provide all submissions and exhibits in both English and Korean languages and the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in the postponement of the hearing, as well as the change in the hearing venue, increased their costs.1623\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 46-50.\n\n976.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Claimant submits that it is entitled to full reimbursement of the costs of this arbitration, including compound interest on the Tribunal's award of costs, as set out below.1624\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Incurred amount (US$ / GBP\u00a3)** |\n| **Payments to

back to the Parties with a subsequent deposit request. Since the Claimant had used a great number of real-time connections at the hearing than the Respondent, the Claimant established an additional deposit of the corresponding amount of GBP 18,995 (USD 23,679.17 according to the exchange rate of 20 May 2022 published by the Bank of England) as reimbursement of the hearing-related expenses.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n977.\n\nIn the event that it is successful in this arbitration, the Respondent requests that that the Tribunal order the Claimant to pay the costs of this arbitration incurred by the Respondent on a fully indemnity basis.1626 Conversely, should the Claimant succeed in any part of its claims, the Respondent takes the view that the Parties should pay their own costs.1627\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 26.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 2.\n\n***1. Alocation of Costs***\n---------------------------\n\n978.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, if it is successful \u2013 including if the Claimant is not awarded damages despite any finding of liability \u2013 in this arbitration, it should be awarded its costs in full on an indemnity basis in accordance with the \"costs follow the event\" rule.1628 In particular, the Respondent argues that it should be made whole, having regard to the Claimant's \"deleterious\" conduct in the course of the proceedings which \"resulted in significant inconvenience and unnecessary time and expense.\"1629 These include:\n\n(a) Filing an Amended Statement of Claim, which included new factual allegations and altered claims on damages, despite its decision to commence arbitration by filing a statement of claim together with its notice of arbitration;1630\n\n(b) Refusing to produce the Settlement Agreement despite relying on it in its Amended Statement Claim;1631\n\n(c) Failing to produce documents related to swap transactions in Cheil on time, which resulted in the Respondent's application to the Tribunal;1632 and\n\n(d) Delaying the production of these documents until the hearing itself, which prompted the Respondent's counsel and experts to devote significant time during the hearing to review and interpret the financial data contained therein and necessitated the Claimant to file an additional witness statement of Mr. Smith, as well as for Mr. Smith to be recalled for further cross-examination on the documents.1633\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 2, 8.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 8, 10.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 9(b), (d).\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 9(c).\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 9(a).\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 9(a).\n\n979.\n\nConversely, should the Claimant succeed in any part on its claims, the Respondent contends that each Party should bear its own costs of the arbitration in light of the \"undue inefficiencies\" that resulted from the Claimant's \"own strategic choices\" as explained above.1634 Moreover, the Respondent takes the view that it should be entitled to recover its costs which it incurred as a result of, among other things, the delayed production of the swap documents and the Settlement Agreement.1635 The Respondent highlights the Tribunal's broad discretion under Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules to apportion costs in proportion that it deems reasonable in the circumstances of the case.1636\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 11-12.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 12.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 4-7.\n\n980.\n\nShould the Tribunal nevertheless decide to award some costs to the Claimant, any costs awarded to the Claimant, the Respondent posits, should be limited to, at most, an amount determined proportionally in relation to the percentage of its claimed damages that the Claimant is actually awarded.1637\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 13.\n\n***2.

The Tribunal's Determination**\n-----------------------------------\n\n983.\n\nThe relevant rules governing award of costs are set out in Article 11.26.2 of the Treaty and Article 40 and 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n984.\n\nArticle 11.26.2 of the Treaty provides that \"[a] tribunal may \u2026 award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules.\"1640\n\nTreaty, Art. 11.26 (**C-1**).\n\n985.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL provides, in relevant part:\n\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\n\n2. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n986.\n\nArticle 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules further provides:\n\n1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award, or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\n\n987.\n\nPursuant to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal \"shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award.\" According to Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the term \"costs\" covers \"only\" the categories of costs listed in the provision. These include the costs of arbitration (*i.e.* the costs incurred by the members of the Arbitral Tribunal and the PCA), as well as the legal costs (*i.e.* the legal and other costs incurred by the Parties in connection with the arbitration).\n\n988.\n\nAs to arbitration costs, the Tribunal notes that each Party has made advance payments in the amount of USD 1,200,000.00, which amount, in total, to USD 2,400,000.00. Furthermore, according to paragraph 11.2 of the Terms of Appointment, each member of the Tribunal was remunerated at the rate of USD 750 per hour for all work carried out in connection with the arbitration. The fees of the members of the Tribunal amount to USD 362,812.50 for Mr. Oscar M. Garibaldi, USD 414,585.00 for Mr. J. Christopher Thomas KC, and USD 594,675.00 for Dr. Veijo Heiskanen. The travel and other expenses of the members of the Tribunal amount to USD 48,814.05. The PCA's fees and expenses for its services, which were paid in accordance with the PCA's schedule of fees, amount to USD 354,992.42. Other costs, which include costs of court reporting, interpretation and translation services, IT support, catering, courier expenses, hearing venue services, currency translation variances, and banking services, amount to USD 584,703.32.\n\n989.\n\nAccordingly, the total costs of the arbitration amount to USD 2,360,582.29. The PCA will provide the Parties with a statement of account after the issuance of this Award and will return any unused balance to the Parties in equal shares.\n\n990.\n\nAs to the allocation of arbitration costs, as quantified above, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that each Party bears its own costs of arbitration. These costs arise directly out of the Parties' arbitration agreement and thus constitute costs that the Parties have agreed to bear, before any arbitration proceedings and thus regardless of the outcome of this case. The Tribunal is also satisfied that the Parties and their counsel have acted in the course of the arbitration in a professional and constructive manner, and accordingly it cannot be said the Parties' conduct has resulted in unnecessary or unreasonable additional arbitration costs.\n\n991.\n\nAs to legal costs, Article 40.2(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that legal costs may be awarded \"to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable.\" The Tribunal considers that what qualifies as \"reasonable\" depends on the circumstances of the case.\n\n992.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' costs submissions, the Tribunal finds that the Parties' legal costs are generally not unreasonable, in light of the importance and complexity of the case. However, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the fees incurred by Kobre & Kim, one of the Claimant's external counsel, in attending the public hearings of the criminal proceedings against President Park, Minister Moon, CIO Hong and JY Lee, over a period of several years, can be considered in their entirety reasonable. The Tribunal notes, in this connection, that it did not rely on the evidence of the Kobre & Kim [REDACTED] including the notes they prepared when attending the hearings or their evidence, in support of any of its findings, but rather relied on the decisions of the Korean courts in those proceedings. While the Claimant may not have been in a position to rely, at the time of the public hearings, on the availability of the decisions of the Korean courts as evidence in the present proceeding, and therefore considered that it was prudent to incur the costs it did, the Tribunal is unable to accept that the total amount of Kobre & Kim's fees, in the total amount of USD 38.8 million, is reasonable in the circumstances of this case. Having considered the matter, the Tribunal has decided to allow USD 8.8 million of these costs, which should reasonably cover the costs incurred by Kobre & Kim, including those incurred in participating in the present proceeding.\n\n993.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that as to the four main categories of issues addressed in this Award \u2013 jurisdiction, merits, causation, and quantum \u2013 the Claimant prevailed on the first three of these issues (jurisdiction, merits and causation), and the Respondent largely prevailed on the fourth one (quantum), the Claimant being awarded some 13-18% of the amount claimed (depending on the applicable holding company discount).1641 The Tribunal therefore considers it appropriate to apportion the Parties' legal costs, in accordance with Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal considers it reasonable to award the Claimant 78% of its legal costs (after the deduction of the amount specified in paragraph 992 above), and the Respondent 22% of its legal costs. Taking into account the Tribunal's decisions above, to the effect that each Party bear its arbitration costs, the Claimant is awarded USD 28,903,188.90,1642 and the Respondent is awarded USD 3,457,479.87.1643\n\n*See* Claimant's Reply PHB, para. 102.\n\nThe portion of the total costs in GBP claimed by the Claimant were converted to USD based on OANDA's exchange rate on the date of the Award. *See* OANDA's Currency Converter, https://www.oanda.com/currency-converter/.\n\nThe portion of the total costs in other currencies claimed by the Respondent were converted to USD based on OANDA's exchange rate on the date of the Award. *See* OANDA's Currency Converter, https://www.oanda.com/currency-converter/.\n\n994.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it appropriate to award both Parties interest on their cost awards at the rate of 5 percent, compounded yearly, payable from 30 days of the date of this Award.\n\n**XI.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal determines as follows:\n\na. The Respondent has breached the Treaty;\n\nb.

The Respondent is ordered to pay the Claimant the legal costs incurred by the Claimant in relation to these proceedings in the amount of USD 28,903,188.90, with interest at the rate of 5 percent, compounded yearly, payable from 30 days of the date of this Award; and\n\nh. All other claims and requests for relief are dismissed.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, the abbreviations and definitions used in this Decision are the same as those introduced in the Award.\n\n2.\n\nOn 18 July 2023, the Respondent submitted its Request for Correction and Interpretation of the Award (the \"**Respondent's Request**\") in accordance with Articles 37 and 38 of the 2013 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 20 July 2023, the Claimant submitted its Request for Correction of the Award (the \"**Claimant's Request**\") in accordance with Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n4.\n\nOn 1 August 2023, the Claimant submitted its response to the Respondent's Request (the \"**Claimant's Response**\"), in which it requested that the Tribunal (i) dismiss the Respondent's Request in its entirety; and (ii) order the Respondent to pay the Claimant the legal costs incurred in connection with the Respondent's Request in U.S. Dollars, with interest.\n\n5.\n\nOn 4 August 2023, the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimant's Request (the \"**Respondent's Response**\"), in which it requested that the Tribunal (i) dismiss the Claimant's Request in its entirety; and (ii) order the Claimant to pay the Respondent the legal costs incurred in connection with the Claimant's Request.\n\n**II. THE RESPONDENT'S REQUEST**\n--------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent submits two requests. First, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal correct an error in the computation of damages, caused by the \"inadvertent\" use of a post-tax figure when a pre-tax figure was intended.2 Second, the Respondent seeks clarification regarding the currency of pre-award interest ordered in paragraph 995(c) of the Award in accordance with Article 37 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 7.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's request for correction exceeds the scope of Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules. It further contends that no ambiguity exists in the Award that warrants an interpretation.\n\n**A. Request for Correction**\n-----------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the category of \"any error in computation\" stipulated in Article 38(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules is broader than \"any clerical or typographical error\" and includes errors, such as miscalculation, use of incorrect data, omission of data in the tribunal's assessment of costs, or failure to include an amount that should have been included in a calculation.3 Moreover, the error must be \"obvious on the face of the award\" and the correction must be to \"effectuate the tribunal's true intentions rather than to alter those intentions.\"4 Accordingly, the Respondent notes that the categories of correctible errors under Article 38(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules are distinct from each other, not all of which are clerical in nature.5\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 29, *referring to* Jan Paulsson & Georgios Petrochilos, UNCITRAL Arbitration (2017), Art. 38, para. 5 (**CLA-205**).\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 11, *citing* N.

Born, International Commercial Arbitration (3rd ed., 2022), para. 24.03 (**RLA-175**).\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 28.\n\n9.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent seeks \"to correct the Tribunal's inadvertent use of a post-tax figure (wrong data) that does not correspond to the Tribunal's stated intention to use pre-tax figures (failure to account for an amount that should have been accounted for).\"6\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 30.\n\n10.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal \"unwittingly\" used a post-tax figure in computing the loss in relation to the Claimant's shares in SC&amp;T that were subject to a reappraisal right under Korean law (the \"**Putback Shares**\"), despite its \"affirmative intention \u2026 to consistently use pre-tax figures for all three components of [the] formula.\"7 In support of its assertion, the Respondent points to the Tribunal's analysis in the Award as follows:\n\n(a) The Tribunal stated that \"the pre-tax amount is the one to be taken into account, to ensure consistency; and indeed Mr. Boulton in his calculation of the Claimant's trading losses also took into account the pre-tax amounts;\"8\n\n(b) The Tribunal used pre-tax amounts for the value of the Claimant's shareholding in the Putback Shares (KRW 535,881,584,700) and the sale proceeds the Claimant received in exercising its reappraisal right for the Putback Shares (KRW 456,620,599,950);9 and\n\n(c) The Tribunal observed that the Claimant received a \"Top-Up Payment from SC&amp;T of KRWS 65,902,634,943, net of withholding and other taxes.\"10\n\nRespondent's Request, paras. 2, 10-11. The Respondent summarizes the Tribunal's formula for the computation of the Claimant's loss in relation to the Putback Shares as follows: *Total loss of Putback Shares* = *Counterfactual Scenario Value* \u2013 *(Sale Proceeds + Top-Up Payment)*.

The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Tribunal has only \"circumscribed power\" under Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules to correct errors in computation that are \"calculating equivalent of the 'clerical or typographical' errors of which this provision allows the correction.\"24 The types of errors that may be corrected are therefore those that are \"merely mechanical,\" such as, for example, changes to dates, names and addresses referenced in the award, sums that do not add up, mixing up currencies, or figures that contain decimal points rather than commas.25\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 6; Claimant's Response, paras. 5-6.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 6; Claimant's Response, paras. 7-8.\n\n19.\n\nMeasured against this standard, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's request for correction should be dismissed for two reasons.26\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 10.\n\n20.\n\nFirst, contrary to what the Respondent alleges, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal's adoption of a post-tax Top-Up Payment value was not \"inadvertent.\"27 Recalling that the Tribunal explicitly referred to the Top-Up Payment \"net of withholding and other taxes,\" the Claimant contends that the Tribunal \"consciously\" and \"knowingly\" adopted the post-tax amount.28\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 11.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 13, *citing* Award, para. 906.\n\n21.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant maintains that the adoption of the post-tax Top-Up Payment was \"entirely logical,\" as it \"ensure[d] consistency in how the Tribunal valued the purchase and sale value of the same shares.\"29 In this respect, the Claimant notes that the Tribunal observed Mr. Boulton's calculation of the Claimant's net trading losses, but not the Top-Up Payment, which had also taken into account pre-tax values.30 To the contrary, the Claimant posits that the Tribunal gave no indication that, for reasons for consistency or otherwise, that it \"intended\" to apply a pre-tax value for the Top-Up Payment.31\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 14\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 14.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 15.\n\n22.\n\nInsofar as the Tribunal was not provided with a pre-tax Top-Up Payment value, the Claimant argues that the Respondent should not be allowed to remedy its \"own omission\" in post-award briefing \"in the guise of a purported correction application.\"32\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 12.\n\n23.\n\nSecond, even assuming *arguendo* that the error was inadvertent, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent's requested correction is not the computational equivalent of clerical or typographical error.33 Rather, it calls on the Tribunal to reconsider evidence, make new findings of fact, adopt a new mathematical formula in order to derive, by itself, the pre-tax value of the Top-Up Payment, adjust its methodology for calculating damages using this new input, and based on these new factual findings, make a series of corrections to the Award.34 Accordingly, for the Claimant, the Respondent's request is \"more akin to a third bite of the apple of post-hearing submissions on quantum\" and thus exceeds the \"strict scope\" permitted under Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules.35\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 10; Claimant's Response, para. 17.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 8; Claimant's Response, paras. 16-17.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 9; Claimant's Response, para. 6.\n\n24.\n\nFinally, the Claimant notes that the Respondent has applied to set aside the Award in part for \"serious irregularity\" under section 68 of the English Arbitration Act 1996 in part for the alleged methodological error that the Respondent requests be addressed by way of correction.36 In the Claimant's view, \"the Tribunal's introduction by way of an Article 38 correction of such a new step in its methodology for calculating damages could itself amount to a serious procedural irregularity.\"37\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 11.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 11.\n\n**B. Request for Interpretation**\n---------------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, ambiguity arises because the Tribunal initially stated that \"[t]he currency to which the pre-award interest is applicable is therefore Korean Won,\" and then subsequently ordered the Respondent to pay pre-award interest at rate of 5% on a sum reflecting the Claimant's loss in U.S. Dollars.38 The Respondent contends that these two statements offer two competing interpretations: (a) the Respondent is required to pay pre-award interest that accrued on USD 53,586,931, without any need for any currency conversion; or (b) the Respondent is required to pay pre-award interest that accrued on KRW 68,744,114,123, with payment to be made in U.S. Dollars.39\n\nRespondent's Request, paras. 26-27.\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 27.\n\n26.\n\nIf pre-tax interest is to be awarded in Korean Won but be payable in U.S. Dollars, the Respondent further submits that there is ambiguity as to the applicable date of conversion from Korean Won to U.S Dollars.40\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 27.\n\n27.\n\nConsequently, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal clarify \"whether the Tribunal intended to order [the Respondent] to calculate the pre-award interest in US Dollars, as stated in paragraphs 995(b) and 995(c), or in Korean Won, as stated in paragraph 961 (and, if the latter, a further clarification as to the applicable date of conversion to US Dollars).\"41\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 28.\n\n***2. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to identify an ambiguity in the Tribunal's Award within the scope of Article 37 of the UNCITRAL Rules.42\n\nClaimant's Response, paras. 20-21, 23.\n\n29.\n\nAs to the currency applicable to the pre-award interest, the Claimant asserts that the Tribunal's reference to Korean Won being the currency to which pre-award interest applied was made only to explain the Tribunal's decision to use the Korean statutory rate of 5% interest compounded annually.43 According to the Claimant, this was \"not a determination that the amount awarded as pre-award interest should actually be *paid* in Won.\"44 In fact, such a determination would have been incompatible with the Tribunal's finding that \"the Claimant is entitled to payment of compensation awarded in U.S. Dollars.\"45\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 24.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 24 (emphasis in original).\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 24, *citing* Award, para. 961.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant also asserts that there is no ambiguity as to the date of conversion of the pre-award interest from Korean Won to U.S. Dollars because the Tribunal clearly stated that that \"the appropriate date of conversion from KRW to USD is the date of this Award.\"46\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 25, *citing* Award, para. 952.\n\n31.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant disputes the need for any clarification of the Award because, in its view, the Respondent \"remains liable to pay the same amount of pre-award interest irrespective of whether it is calculated by reference to a US dollar figure or whether it is first calculated by referenced to a Korean won figure and subsequently converted into US dollars.\"47 As such, for the Claimant, the two possible interpretations of the Award identified by the Respondent would \"lead exactly to the same quantum of damages owed to the Claimant.\"48\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 26\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 26\n\n**III. THE CLAIMANT'S REQUEST**\n-------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal finds that Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules encompasses methodological corrections, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal correct the \"methodological error\" in its calculation of pre-award interest, consistent with the Tribunal's intention to make the Claimant \"whole.\"49\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 17.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's Request seeking to alter the Tribunal's chosen methodology is impermissible under Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules and is, in any event, without merit.\n\n**A. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nShould the Tribunal determine that the scope of Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules extends to corrections in calculation methodology, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal correct the calculation of the interest awarded to the Claimant to reflect the Tribunal's decision to compensate the Claimant \"based on what it would have obtained had it invested the funds corresponding to the amount of compensation during the period when it was deprived of such funds.\"50\n\nClaimant's Request, paras. 12-14, 18, *citing* Award, para. 961.\n\n35.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, while the Tribunal recognized that \"the partial set off of the Claimant's loss was piecemeal over time, rather than immediate on 16 July 2015,\" it failed to take this fact into account when it calculated interest on the Claimant's net loss of KRW 68.74 billion with interest running on this amount from 16 July 2015.51 Consequently, the Claimant contends that the Tribunal \"made a methodological error in its calculation of interest and erroneously failed to make the Claimant 'whole' (as it intended to do), when it omitted to calculate interest based on the actual amount of funds of which the Claimant was deprived for the period between 16 July 2015 and 20 June 2023.\"52\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 17.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 17.\n\n36.\n\nAccordingly, consistent with the Tribunal's intention and the underlying principles of international law, the Claimant requests that Tribunal recalculate the interest after taking into account that the value of the SC&amp;T shares held by the Claimant on 16 July 2015 was in fact KRW 771,026,741,100,21 \"which it only subsequently recovered in partial tranches months and years later: (a) between 17-25 September 2015 (KRW 179,759,400,000); (b) on 18 March 2016 (KRW 456,620,599,950); and (c) on 12 May 2022 (KRW 65,902,634,943).\"53\n\nClaimant's Request, paras. 15-17. *See* Claimant's Request, para. 19.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it is common ground between the Parties that the Claimant's Request does not seek to correct an \"error of computation\" or an error \"of a similar nature\" within the meaning of Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, but rather \"seeks to alter the method adopted by the Tribunal to calculate pre-award interest.\"54 The Respondent submits that the Claimant's acknowledgement as such is a sufficient reason to deny the Claimant's Request.55\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 4, 13.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 3.\n\n38.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to identify an \"error\" that is obvious on the face of the Award that may be corrected under Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules.56 Instead, the Claimant has attempted to \"manufacture\" an error by \"effectively seeking to change not only the Tribunal's methodology as to Pre-Award Interest but also its finding as to the principal amount of Claimant's loss.\"57 The Respondent underscores the Tribunal's finding that the Claimant's loss was limited to \"the difference between the FMV, or the fair market value, of the Claimant's shares in the but-for scenario [*i.e*. SC&T's share price on the valuation date, 16 July 2015] and the actual sales proceeds from the Claimant's sale of the SC&T shares it held.\"58 Yet, the Respondent contends that, contrary to this finding, the Claimant's proposed methodology leads to principal amounts that far exceed the amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal.59 The Claimant is therefore attempting to recover interest on amounts that did not constitute any part of the loss awarded by the Tribunal.60\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 14.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 16.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 8, 18-19, *citing* Award, para. 919. *See also* Award, para. 932.\n\nRespondenet's Response, para. 13.\n\nRespondent's Response, paras. 7-9, 20-21, 23.\n\n39.\n\nEven assuming *arguendo* that the purported error can be corrected in accordance with Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's proposed methodology for calculating loss as \"flawed\" and \"improper.\"61 It argues that the Claimant's proposed methodology (a) awards the Claimant, in the first two of its four time periods, interest on funds corresponding to total shareholding in the SC&T still held by the Claimant during that period; (b) adds to the principal amount in the second, third, and fourth time periods the compounded interest from all prior periods, contrary to the Tribunal's direction that interest be compounded annually.62 In the Respondent's view, this error compounds the previous error by including interest from the first two time periods in the principal amount for the third and fourth time periods.63\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 22.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 22.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 22.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the Respondent's requests for correction and interpretation, and then the Claimant's request for correction.\n\n**A. The Respondent's Request**\n-------------------------------\n\n***1. The Respondent's Request for Correction***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe relevant provision is Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which deals with \"correction of the award.\" Article 38 provides:\n\n1. Within 30 days after receipt of the award, a party, with notice to other parties, may request the arbitral tribunal to correct in the award any error of computation, any clerical or typographical error, or any error or omission of a similar nature. If the arbitral tribunal considers that the request is justified, it shall make the correction within 45 days of receipt of the request.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal may within 30 days after the communication of the award make such corrections on its own initiative.\n\n3. Such corrections shall be in writing and shall form part of the award. The provisions of article 34, paragraphs 2 to 6, shall apply.\n\n42.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Respondent's request was made within 30 days of the receipt of the Award by the Parties, and accordingly it is timely.\n\n43.\n\nAs to the applicable legal standard, the Respondent's request for correction is based on the argument that the Tribunal made an \"error in computation\" in the Award within the meaning of Article 38(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. According to the Respondent, \"[t]he purpose of correction is to conform the Award to the decision intended by the arbitral tribunal.\"64 The Respondent contends that, in the present case, the Tribunal made a \"self-evident error\" in its computation of damages, \"caused by the erroneous (and apparently inadvertent) use of a post-tax figure when a pre-tax figure was intended.\"65\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 6.\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 7.\n\n44.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimant argues, in response, that pursuant to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, \"the Tribunal has only a limited power to correct mechanical, clerical errors.\"66 According to the Claimant, \"the kind of error in 'computation' of which [Article 38] is intended to allow correction is the calculating equivalent of the 'clerical or typographical' errors of which this provision also allows the correction.\"67 The Claimant submits that the corrections requested by the Respondent \"would entail the Tribunal making new findings by revisiting the factual evidence and reevaluating the Tribunal's judgment; they are akin to a third bite at the apple of post-hearing submissions on quantum and should be dismissed.\"68\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 2(i).\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 5.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 2(i).\n\n45.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' legal arguments and the legal authorities relied upon by the Parties in support of their positions, the Tribunal finds that a proper reading of Article 38(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules requires that a distinction be made between an \"error in computation\" and \"any clerical or typographical error.\" As noted by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in *Petrolane, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran*,\n\n[t]he Tribunal Rules [which were adapted from the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, and as to Article 36, currently Article 38, without any modification] make provision for a correction of award on the basis of two main categories of errors: (a) material or substantive errors (ex. errors in computation), and (b) textual errors (such as those made in typing or printing the text, or which are of a grammatical nature). As regards the passage or any errors of similar nature, it unquestionably embraces any conceivable errors which could be categorized as either substantive or textual.69\n\n*Petrolane, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran*, Dec. No. DEC 101-131-2 (25 November 1991), reprinted in 27 Iran-US CTR 264, 265 (1199-II), p. 11 (**CLA-211**). The language of the first sentence of Article 36 of the Tribunal Rules is in substance identical to the language of the first sentence of Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules. *See also* Luis Olavo Baptista, Correction and Clarification of Awards, ICCA Congress Series No. 15 (Rio 2010), Arbitration Advocacy in Changing Times, p. 281 (**RLA-174**) (\"Material errors are computational, such as mistakes in the calculation of a certain amount.\"); Jan Paulsson & Georgios Petrochilos, UNCITRAL Arbitration, p. 347 (**CLA-205**) (\"All three categories of errors described in article 38(1) fall within the notion of inadvertent slips. \u2026 The error must thus be of a material nature rather than an intellectual error in the tribunal's judgment.\").\n\n46.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that a \"material or substantive\" error in computation qualifies as an \"error in computation\" within the meaning of Article 38(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Article 38(1) does not deal merely with errors \"equivalent of\" clerical or typographical errors, but also allows the correction of a material or substantive error in computation.\n\n47.\n\nHaving considered the Parties' positions, the Tribunal finds that there is indeed an error of computation in the Award within the meaning of Article 38(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, as interpreted above. As noted by the Respondent, the Tribunal made clear in the Award that it intended to rely consistently on pre-tax amounts of all elements relevant to the computation of the compensation due to the Claimant, including the actual proceeds for the Putback Shares that the Claimant received pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The actual proceeds in turn were calculated by the Tribunal as the sum of the proceeds that the Claimant received in exercising its reappraisal right for the Putback Shares under Article 1.1 of the Settlement Agreement and the Top Up Payment that the Claimant received pursuant to Article 2.4 of the Settlement Agreement.\n\n48.\n\nHowever, the amount of the Top Up Payment (KRW 65,902,634,943) received by the Claimant, as communicated by the Claimant in its Reply PHB, was \"net of withholding and other taxes.\"70 Although the Claimant did not provide the pre-tax amount in its submission and such amount was not available as such anywhere else in the record (indeed the Parties' Reply PHBs being the very last substantive submissions in the matter), the Tribunal notes that the amount can be calculated, as noted by the Respondent, by using the formula set out in Article 2.4 of the Settlement Agreement. The formula reads as follows:\n\n\"Top Up Payment\" means A multiplied by B, where (i) = the amount of consideration or other transfer of value per share (whether described as such or not and including without limitation any payment or transfer of value which is described as compensation for or in respect of any loss, cost or liability) which is in excess of the Suggested Price paid or made (a) in respect of or in connection with the purchase by SC&amp;T or any other SC&amp;T Group member or other SC&amp;T Person, or any of their respective nominees of any shares in Extinct SC&amp;T (now being shares in SC&amp;T) from any shareholder or former shareholder of Extinct SC&amp;T (or any of its affiliates or its or their officers or controllers) which or who exercised dissention rights with respect to the Merger; or (b) in respect of any other Top Up Event transaction, and (B) = 7,732,779.71\n\nClaimant's Reply PHB, para. 102.\n\nShare Purchase Price and Transfer Agreement between Elliott Associates, L.P. and Samsung SC&T Corporation, 15 March 2016, Art. 2.4, Definition of \"Top Up Payment\" (**C-450**).\n\n49.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement defined the \"Suggested Price\" as KRW 57,234, whereas the amount paid to shareholders other than the Claimant in the form of the appraisal price as confirmed by the Korean Supreme Court in April 2022 amounted to KRW 66,602 per share, which is KRW 9,368 higher than the Suggested Price.72 Accordingly, applying the formula set out in Article 2.4 of the Settlement Agreement (KRW (66,602 \u2013 57,234) x 7,732,779), the pre-tax amount of the Top Up payment is KRW 72,440,673,672 (instead of KRW 65,902,634,943, as stated in the Award). the Award must thus be corrected to reflect the pre-tax amount of the Top Up Payment.\n\nSupreme Court Case No. 2016Ma5394 (Consolidated), 14 April 2022 (**C-782**).\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the corrections to the Award requested by the Respondent and agrees that, except for a number of typographical errors, they correctly set out the consequences of the above correction. The Tribunal therefore corrects the relevant paragraphs (936, 938, and 948) of the Award, including the typographical errors in the Respondent's Request, as set out in Section V (\"Decision\") below.\n\n***2. The Respondent's Request for Interpretation***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe relevant provision governing this request is Article 37 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which deals with \"interpretation of the award.\" Article 37 provides:\n\n1. Within 30 days after receipt of the award, a party, with notice to the other parties, may request that the arbitral tribunal give an interpretation of the award.\n\n2. The interpretation shall be given in writing within 45 days after the receipt of the request. The interpretation shall form part of the award and the provisions of article 34, paragraphs 2 to 6, shall apply.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal \"resolve an ambiguity in relation to the currency in which pre-award interest should be computed.\"73 The Respondent notes that according to paragraph 961 of the Award, since the Claimant incurred and has quantified its losses in Korean Won, \"[t]he currency to which the pre-award interest is applicable is therefore Korean Won.\"74 Nevertheless, since the operative part of the Award orders that the Respondent pay the Claimant pre-award interest at a rate of 5 percent on the sum stated in paragraph 995(b) of the Award, which is stated in U.S. Dollars, there is an ambiguity in the Award as to whether pre-award interest should be calculated in Korean Won or U.S. Dollars, and further whether, if pre-award interest is to be calculated in Korean Won and then to be converted to U.S. Dollars, \"whether that date [*i.e*. the date of conversion] should be the date of the Award or the date of payment.\"75\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 23.\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 26, *citing* Award, para. 961.\n\nRespondent's Request, para. 27.\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimant argues, in response, that there is no ambiguity in the Award, for three reasons. First, the Tribunal determined clearly that the currency in which the pre-award interest is applicable is Korean Won. This finding did not imply that the amount awarded as pre-award interest should actually be paid in Korean Won. Second, there is no ambiguity as to the date of conversion for purposes of payment since the Tribunal determined \"in no uncertain terms\" that the appropriate date of conversion from Korean Won to U.S. Dollars is the date of the Award.76 Third, no clarification is required in any event since for the purposes of calculating damages, including pre-award interest, \"any conversion from Korean won to US dollars must take place on the date of the Award.\"77 Accordingly, the two possible interpretations are \"mathematically equivalent and would lead to exactly the same quantum of damages owed to the Claimant.\"78\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 25.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 26.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 26.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent's application was made within 30 days of the receipt of the Award, and accordingly it was timely.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it made the following determinations in the Award regarding pre-award interest that are relevant to the issue of the currency in which pre-award interest is to be calculated and paid:\n\n(a) In paragraph 948 of the Award, the Tribunal determined that \"the Claimant's loss of value of its investment as a result of the Respondent's breach of the Treaty amounts to KRW 68,744,114,123;\"\n\n(b) In paragraph 952 of the Award, the Tribunal determined that the Claimant is entitled to payment of compensation in U.S. Dollars, and that \"the appropriate date of conversion from KRW is the date of this Award.\" The Tribunal determined that on that date the amount of the Award was USD 53,586,931;\n\n(c) In paragraph 961 of the Award, the Tribunal determined that \"since the Claimant incurred and has quantified its losses in Korean Won, the appropriate date of conversion must be the date of the Award and not any earlier date,\" and that accordingly \"[t]he currency to which the pre-award interest is applicable is therefore Korean Won;\" and\n\n(d) In paragraph 995(c), which forms part of the operative part of the Award, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent \"to pay the Claimant pre-award interest at a rate of 5 percent on the sum in sub-paragraph (b) above, compounded yearly from 16 July 2015 until the date of this Award.\"\n\n56.\n\nAccordingly, in light of these determinations, the pre-award interest is to be calculated on the amount of the Award in Korean Won, KRW 68,744,114,123, at a rate of 5 percent, compounded yearly from 16 July 2015 until the date of the Award. The total amount awarded, including pre-award interest, is then to be converted into U.S. Dollars on the date of the Award, as reflected in the language of paragraphs 952, 995(b) and 995(c) of the Award. The reference in paragraph 995(c) of the Award to \"the sum in sub-paragraph (b) above\" thus must be read as referring to the amount of the Award in Korean Won, as converted into U.S. Dollars on the date of the Award, in accordance with paragraph 952 of the Award.79\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the recapitulation of the sums set out in paragraphs 55-56 above reflected the Tribunal's analysis at the time of the making of the Award and that they now stand to be corrected in light of its decision to accept the Respondent's request for correction.\n\n57.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal does not consider that there is any ambiguity in the Award, and accordingly the Respondent's request for interpretation is dismissed.\n\n**B. The Claimant's Request**\n-----------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal correct its computation of interest, as \"there have been errors, so that the outcome has deviated from [the determinations and principles on which the Award is based], contrary to the Tribunal's own intention.\"80 The Claimant submits its request on the assumption that the Tribunal accepts that \"Article 38 encompasses methodological corrections,\" even though its primary case, in response to the Respondent's request, is that Article 38 does not extend to methodological errors.81\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 16.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 12.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"the partial set off of the Claimant's loss was piecemeal over time, rather than immediate on 16 July 2015.\"82 However, according to the Claimant, the Tribunal's calculation failed to reflect this fact. Specifically, the Tribunal based its interest calculations on the Claimant's net loss with interest running on the final net amount from 16 July 2015, however, according to the Claimant,\n\nthe value of the SC&amp;T shares that the Claimant held on 16 July 2015 was KRW 771,026,741,100, which it only subsequently recovered in partial tranches months and years later: (i) between 17-25 (KRW 179,759,400,000); (ii) on 18 March 2016 (KRW 456,620,599,950); and (iii) on 12 May 2022 (KRW 65,902,634,943). The Tribunal therefore made a methodological error in its calculation of interest and erroneously failed to make the Claimant \"whole\" (as intended to do), when it omitted to calculate interest based on the actual amount of funds of which the Claimant was deprived for the period between 16 July 2015 and 20 June 2023.83\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 17.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 17 (citations omitted).\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimant therefore proposes a correction to the Award \"to ensure that the computation reflects the Tribunal's decision to compensate the Claimant 'based on what it would have obtained had it invested the funds corresponding to the amount of compensation during the period when it was deprived of such funds.'\"84 The Claimant sets out the basis on which the Claimant's entitlement to interest should be calculated in paragraph 19 of its Request for Correction, and its requested corrections in paragraph 20 of its Request for Correction.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 18.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's Request is \"utterly without merit\" and should be denied as the Claimant itself acknowledges that it seeks to \"alter the 'methodology' adopted by the Tribunal for determining Claimant's loss.\"85 According to the Respondent, the Claimant's request falls outside the scope of Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules and \"is of a fundamentally different nature than Korea's Request.\"86 The Respondent notes that the Tribunal quantified the amount of compensation on which the Respondent was ordered to pay interest at KRW 68,744,114,123, whereas \"the amount of principal on which Claimant seeks to accrue pre-award interest is larger \u2013 by an order of magnitude \u2013 than the amount of compensation award by the Tribunal.\"87 Accordingly, in the Respondent's view, the \"Claimant is seeking a windfall by attempting to recover interest on amounts that did not constitute any part of the loss awarded by the Tribunal. Put differently, Claimant effectively is seeking to challenge the Tribunal's determination of the amount of Claimant's principal loss.\"88\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 3.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 3.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 8.\n\nRespondent's Response, para. 9.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimant's application was made within 30 days of the receipt of the Award, and accordingly it was timely.\n\n63.\n\nAs noted above, under Article 38(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, a party may request that the arbitral tribunal \"correct in the award any error in computation, any clerical or typographical error, or any error or omission of a similar nature.\" The Claimant's case is that the Tribunal's award of interest does not reflect the principles and determinations in the Award, in particular the principle that the Claimant be made whole and that the amount of compensation be based on \"what [the Claimant] would have obtained had it invested the funds corresponding to the amount of compensation during the period when it was deprived of such funds.\"89 According to the Claimant, the Tribunal should therefore have relied upon the market value of the SC&T shares on 16 July 2015, *i.e*. KRW 771,026,741,100, as the basis of its interest calculation rather than the Claimant's net loss (KRW 68.74 billion). The Claimant thus seeks a change of the basis of calculation of interest, and therefore its request is not for a correction of an error in computation, but for a revision of the Award.\n\nClaimant's Request, para. 18, *citing* Award, para. 961.\n\n64.\n\nAccordingly, since the correction that the Claimant is seeking does not qualify as a correction of \"error in computation\" within the meaning of Article 38(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, it stands to be dismissed.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n65.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal determines as follows:\n\n(a) The Respondent's request for correction of the Award is granted as follows:\n\n1. In paragraph 936, lines 9-10 of the Award, the sentence \"Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, EALP subsequently received a 'Top Up Payment' from SC&T, in the total amount of KRW 65,902,634,943\" is replaced to read \"Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, EALP subsequently received a 'Top Up Payment' from SC&T, in the total amount of KRW 65,902,634,943, corresponding to a pre-tax amount of KRW 72,440,673,672,\" and the related footnote no. 1573 (\"*See* Claimant's Reply PHB, para. 102\") is corrected to read \"*See* Claimant's Reply PHB, para. 102; Supreme Court Case No. 2016Ma5394 (Consolidated), 14 April 2022 (**C-782**); Settlement Agreement, Art. 2.4 (**C-450**);\"\n\n2.
