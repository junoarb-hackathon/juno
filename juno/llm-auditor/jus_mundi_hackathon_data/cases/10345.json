Hereinafter, Claimant and Respondent shall be jointly referred to as the \"**Parties**\".\n\n2.\n\nOn 10 August 2020 the Parties received the consolidated version of the Terms of Appointment, which were deemed to have been signed by the Parties and the Arbitrators on 4 August 2020.\n\n3.\n\nOn 14 October 2020 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, on the conduct of the arbitration and the procedural timetable, after consulting with the Parties.\n\n4.\n\nPursuant to the procedural timetable, on 30 October 2020 Claimant filed its Statement of Claim. On 20 November 2020 Respondent submitted a Motion for Bifurcation of the jurisdictional questions from the merits and damages [the \"**Motion**\"].

POSITION OF MOZAMBIQUE**\n-----------------------------\n\n8.\n\nMozambique submits that the bifurcation of the jurisdictional questions from the merits and damages is the efficient, economical and a sensible approach to this case1.\n\nMotion, p. 1.\n\n**A. Criteria for bifurcation**\n-------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nMozambique explains that under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 1976 [\"**UNCITRAL Rules**\"], the Tribunal has the power to bifurcate jurisdictional questions. According to Mozambique, tribunals generally inquire whether the jurisdictional objections2:\n\n- Are \"*prima facie* serious and substantial\",\n\n- Can \"be examined without prejudging or entering the merits\", and\n\n- \"If successful [would] dispose of all or an essential part of the claims made\".\n\nMotion, p. 7, referring to Doc. RL-2 [*Philip Morris Asia Ltd. v. Commonwealth of Australia*, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No 8 on Bifurcation, 14 April 2014, at para. 109].\n\n**B. There are substantial jurisdictional questions**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nAccording to Mozambique, these factors favor the bifurcation of jurisdiction in the present proceedings3, given that there are substantial jurisdictional questions:\n\n- Whether Patel made an investment (**a.**),\n\n- Whether the Parties contractually agreed to ICC arbitration (**b.**),\n\n- Whether in the 2011 Memorandum of Interest [\"**MOI**\"] the Parties chose to proceed before the ICC in the case of claims arising under the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of India and the Republic of Mozambique for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investment [\"**BIT**\"] (**c.**),\n\n- Whether this UNCITRAL proceeding should yield to the ICC arbitration (**d.**),\n\nand\n\n- Whether Patel exhausted its remedies in Mozambique (**e.**).\n\nMotion, p. 8.\n\n**a. First Objection: whether Patel made an investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nMozambique notes that Patel asserts that in 2011 it entered into a MOI with Mozambique, pursuant to which Patel was allegedly provided a right of first refusal to enter into a concession to build a railroad/port in Mozambique. Thereafter, a dispute arose whether Mozambican law required the public tender of the project. To resolve the matter, Patel organized a consortium and agreed to participate in a 2013 public tender. In such tender, Patel was provided a point bidding advantage to account for the MOI. After Patel's consortium did not win, Patel abandoned the consortium and reverted to insisting on its alleged right of first refusal4.\n\nMotion, pp. 1 and 5.\n\n12.\n\nMozambique finds that, before reaching the merits of Patel's claims, the Tribunal must determine whether the purported right of first refusal, the MOI and/or the expenditures related to the preparation of a feasibility study, constitute an \"investment\" sufficient for there to be jurisdiction *ratione materiae*. In Respondent's view, they do not:\n\n13.\n\nFirst, there are doubts as to whether the MOI and a right of first refusal are an investment. According to various tribunals, a MOI is merely an expression of interest and does not constitute an investment5. Mozambique submits that in the present case the MOI did not compel Patel or the Mozambican Ministry of Transport and Communications [\"**MTC**\"] to enter into a concession. The MOI contained several conditions precedent that had to be satisfied before it became a binding commitment and Patel was free not to exercise its option. Mozambique finds that the MOI is like a memorandum of understanding, which, according to the findings of the tribunal in *PSEG Global*, is not an investment6.\n\nMotion, p. 9, referring to Doc. RL-5 [*PSEG Global Inc., The North American Coal Corp., and Konya Ilgin Elektrik \u00dcretim ve Ticaret Ltd. Sirketi v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5 Decision on Jurisdiction, 4 June 2004, para. 176.]\n\nMotion, pp. 9-10.\n\n14.\n\nSecond, Mozambique contends that there are also substantial questions as to whether the expenditures made by Patel in connection with the MOI \u2013 including those incurred in preparation of the feasibility study \u2013 constitute an investment7. Mozambique avers that such expenditures are not an investment because the concession never came to fruition. Mozambique finds that even if Patel were to have a contract claim under local law (*quod non*), that type of claim is not protected under the BIT8.\n\nMotion, pp. 10-11, referring to Doc. RL-6 [*Mihaly Int'l Corp. v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2, Award, 15 March 2002, paras. 48-50].\n\nMotion, p. 11.\n\n15.\n\nThird, Mozambique invokes the *Salini* factors and points out that an investment requires a substantial contribution by the investor, for a certain duration, the existence of an operational risk, a certain regularity of profit for the investor, and a contribution to the economic development of the host State9. According to Respondent, applying these factors in the present case, one finds that this is a pre-concession, pre-investment contractual dispute, involving the validity of the MOI and Patel's belated claims over a completed public tender10:\n\n- The preparation of a feasibility study is not a substantial contribution to Mozambique, lacks sufficient duration and contains no operational risk;\n\n- Likewise, there is no profit arising from the MOI itself and the MOI did not provide a contribution to Mozambique's economic development.\n\nMotion, p. 11, referring to Doc. RL-7 [*Salini Construttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, para. 52].\n\nMotion, pp. 1, 5-6 and 11-12.\n\n16.\n\nFourth, there is a question whether the MOI is an investment for the purposes of Art. 1(b)(iii) of the BIT, given that the MOI is exploratory and conditional, and not a \"right to money\"; it also does not have financial value11. Furthermore, Art. 1(b)(v) of the BIT does not apply either, given that no concession was conferred by Mozambique to Patel by law or under contract12.\n\nMotion, p. 12, referring to Art. 1(b)(iii) of the BIT, which according to Respondent defines an investment as \"rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\".\n\nMotion, p. 12, referring to Art. 1(b)(v) of the BIT, which according to Respondent provides that investments include \"business concessions conferred by law or under contract\".\n\n17.\n\nLastly, Mozambique submits that Patel never registered as a foreign investor in Mozambique pursuant to Art. 22, Section 1 of the Mozambique Investment Law13. Given that the BIT defines investments as those made \"in accordance with the national laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made\", Patel cannot be considered an investor14.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Art. 22, Section 1 of the Mozambique Investment Law requires that a \"foreign investor, within one hundred and twenty (120) days counted from the date of notification of the decision authorizing the investment project, shall register the undertaking involving direct foreign investment with the authority responsible for monitoring the inflow of capital, and register subsequently each actual capital import operation that takes place\" [Motion, p. 12].\n\nMotion, p. 12.\n\n**b. Second Objection: whether the Parties contractually agreed to ICC Arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nMozambique argues that the MOI's arbitration agreement provides for arbitration under the ICC Rules in Mozambique15. The agreement is valid, enforceable and severable from the question of the MOI's validity16. From Mozambique's perspective, Patel intentionally violated the MOI's arbitration agreement when it filed this UNCITRAL arbitration. Mozambique further notes that the ICC Rules are sufficiently broad to permit arbitration of investment treaty claims17.\n\nMotion, p. 6, referring to Doc. R-1 [MOI, Clause 10].\n\nMotion, p. 13.\n\nMotion, p. 13.\n\n19.\n\nMozambique explains that it submitted a request for arbitration, dated 20 May 2020, against Patel, pursuant to the MOI's arbitration agreement and the ICC Rules [the \"**ICC Arbitration**\"]18. Mozambique finds that Patel must bring its BIT claims in the ICC Arbitration and that this Tribunal must respect and give effect to the Parties' arbitration agreement and selection of Mozambique as the place of arbitration19.\n\nMotion, p. 6.\n\nMotion, p. 13.\n\n**c. Third Objection: whether the Parties elected under the BIT to proceed before the ICC**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nMozambique further submits that there is a substantial jurisdictional question whether in the MOI the Parties chose to bring claims under the BIT before the ICC.\n\n21.\n\nMozambique notes that under the BIT the parties may agree to a particular mode of dispute resolution \"in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party which has admitted the investment to that Contracting Party's competent judicial, arbitral or administrative bodies\"20. According to Respondent, the ICC is an arbitral body recognized in Mozambique. Mozambique further points out that the MOI provides that21:\n\n\"The arbitration will be governed by Mozambique law and the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce shall be followed.\"\n\nMotion, p. 14, referring to Doc. R-1 [MOI, Clause 10].\n\nMotion, p. 14, referring to Doc. RL-8 [Art. 9(2)(a) of the BIT].\n\n22.\n\nTherefore, it can be argued that the Parties agreed in the MOI to submit their disputes under the BIT to ICC arbitration22.\n\nMotion, p. 14.\n\n**d. Fourth Objection: whether this proceeding should yield to the ICC Arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nMozambique finds that there is a substantial jurisdictional question whether this UNICTRAL proceeding should be dismissed or stayed in deference to the pending ICC Arbitration23.\n\nMotion, p. 14.\n\n24.\n\nMozambique contends that this UNCITRAL proceeding is subsumed within the ICC Arbitration, where Mozambique and the MTC seek a relief which is substantially broader than the issues raised in this UNCITRAL proceeding, and which includes investment treaty questions24. Furthermore, Mozambique notes that Patel is participating in the ICC Arbitration and requesting relief on the merits, including an award that Mozambique and the MTC \"have violated their obligations under the MOI\"25. Therefore, Mozambique submits that the ICC Arbitration can determine all contract and BIT disputes among all parties, including the MTC.\n\nMotion, p. 15.\n\nMotion, p. 18.\n\n25.\n\nIn the alternative, Mozambique finds that the present arbitration should be suspended until the ICC Arbitration determines the validity of the MOI and contractual rights thereunder26. In the *Fraport* case, the tribunal accepted an objection to ICSID jurisdiction, holding that since the investment was contrary to local law, there was no investment under the treaty. Mozambique submits that if it were found that the MOI violated Mozambican procurement law, there would be no protected investment under the BIT and the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction27.\n\nMotion, p. 18.\n\nMotion, pp. 15 and 18, referring to Doc. RL-9 [*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 23 July 2007, para. 19, 44, 46].\n\n**e. Fifth Objection: whether Patel exhausted remedies in Mozambique**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nMozambique argues that, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that the ICC Arbitration does not encompass BIT claims, the Tribunal should still dismiss or suspend this arbitration. Pursuant to Art. 39 of Mozambican Law No. 15/2011 on Public Private Partnerships, disputes must be resolved pursuant to the terms of the parties' contract; and in the present case, the contract dispute has not yet been resolved in the ICC Arbitration28.\n\nMotion, p. 18.\n\n27.\n\nLastly, Mozambique avers that Patel's bid dispute should have been timely resolved utilizing the procedures for contesting bids under Mozambican procurement law. By trying to belatedly turn a procurement dispute into an investment treaty case, Patel seeks to impermissibly expand the scope of investor-State arbitration29.\n\nMotion, p. 19.\n\n**C. The jurisdictional objections are not intertwined with the merits**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nMozambique argues that the above jurisdictional questions are not inextricably intertwined with the merits or damages: they relate to whether the MOI and expenditures constitute an investment, and whether this Tribunal should respect and enforce the Parties' arbitration agreement. Such questions are thus distinct from the merits (such as whether the MOI is valid, what are the substantive rights under the MOI, whether there was a breach of the MOI, whether there are investment treaty claims, and whether there are damages)30.\n\nMotion, pp. 19-20.\n\n29.\n\nTherefore, Mozambique requests that the Tribunal bifurcate the jurisdictional objections, since this is the most efficient and economical solution, which will allow the Parties and the Tribunal to save resources31.\n\nMotion, p. 20.\n\n**2. POSITION OF PATEL**\n------------------------\n\n30.\n\nClaimant submits that the Motion should be dismissed because procedural efficiency and fairness militate against the bifurcation of Respondent's jurisdictional objections in this case32.\n\nResponse, para. 2.\n\n**A. Criteria for bifurcation**\n-------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nClaimant argues that the Tribunal's discretion to bifurcate jurisdictional questions must be exercised with care, particularly where bifurcation could increase the time and costs of the overall proceedings33. According to Claimant, fairness and procedural efficiency are determinant when considering a bifurcation application34. Procedural efficiency is even more *\u00e0 propos* where the arbitration is seated in The Hague, as is the case here35.\n\nResponse, paras. 14-18.\n\nResponse, para. 18, referring to Doc. CLA-183 [*Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn UK Holdings Limited (CUHL) v. Government of India*, PCA Case No. 2016-7, Procedural Order No. 4 \u2013 Decision on the Respondent's Application for Bifurcation, 19 April 2017, para. 78].\n\nResponse, para. 19, referring to Art. 1036(3) of the Dutch Arbitration Act: \"The arbitral tribunal shall guard against unreasonable delay of the proceedings and, if necessary, at the request of a party or of its own motion, take measures. The parties shall mutually be obliged to prevent unreasonable delay of the proceedings.\"\n\n32.\n\nAs to the factors that the Tribunal should consider when assessing the Motion, Patel argues that each case turns on its own circumstances, but that the factors identified in the *Glamis* case constitute helpful guidance36. Although Claimant does not disagree with the criteria put forward by Respondent, it argues that they are not \"one-size-fit-all\". Furthermore, Claimant notes that Mozambique relies on a low threshold to determine whether a jurisdictional objection is substantial; therefore, the Tribunal should prefer the standard formulated in *Glamis*37.\n\nResponse, para. 20, referring to Doc. CLA-190 [*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised), 31 May 2005, paras. 10-11].\n\nResponse, paras. 22-24.\n\n**B. Procedural efficiency and fairness militate against bifurcation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nPatel finds that in the circumstances of this case, bifurcation would not promote procedural efficiency and economy. It would also be unfair for the Tribunal to grant Respondent's Motion38.\n\nResponse, para. 38.\n\n34.\n\nPatel submits that Respondent's objections as to the existence and legality of the investment are intertwined with the merits and quantum, and require the Tribunal to consider a substantial amount of evidence at the jurisdictional stage39:\n\n- The objection concerning the existence of an investment requires the Tribunal to review the vast majority of the documentary and witness evidence submitted in the Statement of Claim, including expert forensic evidence on the authenticity of the version of the MOI relied upon by Patel;\n\n- The objection in respect of the legality of the investment requires the consideration of expert evidence on Mozambican law, that is also relevant to the merits of Patel's case.\n\nResponse, paras. 3 and 29-33.\n\n35.\n\nAs to Respondent's other objections, which essentially revolve around the parallel ICC Arbitration, they are so frivolous and contrived that it would be a waste of time and costs to deal with such objections on a preliminary basis. Patel finds that it would also be unfair for Mozambique to be permitted to benefit from its own procedural tactics40: Respondent and the MTC commenced the ICC Arbitration three months after this arbitration was commenced and almost two years after Respondent had been notified of an investment dispute between the Parties under the BIT41. According to Patel, proof that the ICC Arbitration is a mere tactical maneuver aimed at undermining this arbitration is the fact that Mozambique and the MTC have no genuine claim in the ICC Arbitration, in which they essentially seek declaratory relief42.\n\nResponse, paras. 4 and 34-37.\n\nResponse, para. 7.\n\nResponse, para. 8.\n\n36.\n\nPatel further finds that Respondent's arguments on procedural efficiency and reducing unnecessary costs are contradicted by the fact that Respondent refused to consolidate both the ICC Arbitration and this proceeding in a single arbitration under either set of arbitration rules, with a seat in a neutral jurisdiction43.\n\nResponse, paras. 10-13 and 36.\n\n**C. The objections are meritless and intertwined with the merits/quantum**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. First Objection: whether Patel made an investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nPatel finds that Mozambique's First Objection is meritless and intertwined with the merits, which means that there would be no procedural efficiency in bifurcating it.\n\n38.\n\nFirst, Patel argues that it invested in an economic transaction aimed at developing a rail corridor and port in Mozambique, valued at USD 3,115 billion [\"**Project**\"]. According to Patel, its investment included44:\n\n- The direct award of a concession to implement the Project and all the rights under the MOI associated with the Project (right of first refusal, exclusive right to develop the Project etc.);\n\n- The value of the information and data transferred to Mozambique;\n\n- The preliminary study conducted by Patel in 2011;\n\n- The detailed prefeasibility study carried out by Patel during 2011-2012.\n\nResponse, para. 42.\n\n39.\n\nPatel submits that to determine Respondent's objection, the Tribunal must answer the question of what comprised Patel's investment, including what was agreed under the MOI. According to Patel, this is not a question that can be resolved on the face of the MOI, but will require the Tribunal to review extensive factual and expert evidence (including evidence on the history and implementation of the MOI, as well as on the authenticity of the English version relied upon by Claimant)45.\n\nResponse, paras. 43-44.\n\n40.\n\nClaimant finds that the question of what was agreed under the MOI is intertwined with the merits. The Tribunal must determine what was or not promised to Patel to decide Patel's claims that Respondent breached the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard and that Respondent indirectly expropriated Patel's contractual rights to a concession and to exclusivity46.\n\nResponse, para. 45.\n\n41.\n\nIn any case, Claimant argues that Respondent's objection is meritless as a matter of law. In the *PSEG Global* case, on which Respondent relies, the tribunal found that the concession agreement between PSEG and the Turkish government was a valid concession agreement, which constituted an investment. As to the decision on the memorandum of understanding, the circumstances of that case have nothing to do with the case at hand47.\n\nResponse, para. 47.\n\n42.\n\nSecond, Respondent's objection on the basis that expenditure made by Claimant in connection with the MOI does not constitute an investment is equally meritless. Claimant does not rely on expenditure in relation to the MOI as its investment. In any case, this goes to show that the determination of what was agreed between the Parties under the MOI is key to the determination of whether Claimant has made a qualifying investment48.\n\nResponse, paras. 49-51.\n\n43.\n\nThird, as to the *Salini* factors invoked by Respondent, this objection cannot be decided on the face of the MOI. The determination of what comprised Patel's investment and what was agreed under the MOI requires the Tribunal to consider substantial factual and expert evidence; it is also intertwined with the merits and quantum49. Patel notes that there is also considerable debate as to whether the *Salini* criteria are compulsory requirements or mere indicators of the possible existence of an investment. In any event, such criteria are met in the present case50.\n\nResponse, paras. 52-53.\n\nResponse, para. 54.\n\n44.\n\nFourth, Patel submits that its investment clearly falls within the scope of the definition of \"investment\" under the BIT, as demonstrated in the Statement of Claim. Patel further argues that its investment is much broader than Respondent tries to define it, and includes the information, data, studies, and know-how provided by Patel to Mozambique, without which Mozambique's largest infrastructure project to date would have been a non-starter51.\n\nResponse, paras. 57-58.\n\n45.\n\nLastly, Patel argues that it is well-established that failure to register an investment, even if such registration is required by law, is not sufficient for a finding that an investment has not been made in accordance with the law52.\n\nResponse, para. 60, referring to Doc. CLA-87 [*Mytilineos Holdings SA v. The State Union of Serbia & Montenegro and Republic of Serbia*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 8 September 2006, para. 146].\n\n**b. Second Objection: whether the Parties contractually agreed to ICC Arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nPatel agrees that the ICC Rules may be appropriate to govern a BIT dispute \u2013 in fact, Patel has offered that the two arbitrations be consolidated under the ICC Rules. However, Respondent conflates the issue of the arbitration rules with that of jurisdiction, suggesting that the ICC tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this claim53. Patel submits that this is incorrect:\n\n- Clause 10 of the MOI only covers claims arising out of the MOI, not disputes arising out of violations of the BIT, which contains a separate dispute resolution agreement;\n\n- The law applicable to the MOI is Mozambique law, not international law;\n\n- Tribunals appointed under an arbitration clause contained in a contract have no basis to uphold their jurisdiction under a separate arbitration agreement contained in an investment treaty; *a contrario*, treaty tribunals routinely hold that they have jurisdiction to hear claims arising out of a breach of contractual obligations where a breach of an umbrella clause is invoked.\n\nResponse, para. 62.\n\n47.\n\nAccordingly, the only tribunal that has jurisdiction to hear both arguments under the MOI and under the BIT is this Tribunal54.\n\nResponse, para. 63.\n\n**c. Third Objection: whether the Parties elected under the BIT to proceed before the ICC**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nPatel finds that Mozambique's Third Objection is meritless for three reasons:\n\n49.\n\nFirst, the Parties' agreement to submit disputes arising out of the MOI to ICC arbitration is not an agreement for the purposes of Art. 9(2)(a) of the BIT, which clearly refers to a dispute under the Treaty, and not to a contractual dispute55. Claimant's claim is for breach of the Treaty, not of the MOI. In contrast, Clause 10 of the MOI only covers disputes \"arising out of this Memorandum\"56.\n\nResponse, paras. 65-66.\n\nResponse, para. 66.\n\n50.\n\nSecond, Art. 9(2)(a) of the BIT contemplates that the parties' agreement as to dispute resolution must be subsequent to their failure to settle the dispute amicably. In the present case, the negotiation period started seven years after the MOI was entered into. Therefore, the parties to the MOI could not have contemplated that their investment dispute, which would arise seven years later, would be covered by Clause 10 of the MOI57.\n\nResponse, para. 67.\n\n51.\n\nThird, the Parties were aware of the BIT (which had entered into force in 2009) at the time they executed the MOI in May 2011. Yet, the Parties did not exclude a resort to the BIT in Clause 10 of the MOI. This shows that Clause 10 of the MOI only covers disputes \"arising out of\" the MOI and not investment disputes58.\n\nResponse, para. 68.\n\n**d. Fourth Objection: whether this proceeding should yield to the ICC Arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nPatel argues that \"it is difficult to see how [Respondent's Fourth Objection] is a proper jurisdictional objection\"59.\n\nResponse, paras. 69-71.\n\n53.\n\nClaimant notes that the ICC Arbitration was commenced by Mozambique after Claimant commenced this arbitration, the request for arbitration in the ICC Arbitration reads as a response to the arguments raised by Patel in this arbitration, and Mozambique and the MTC have essentially sought declaratory relief in the ICC Arbitration, including relief aimed at depriving this Tribunal of jurisdiction over Claimant's claims60.\n\nResponse, para. 71.\n\n54.\n\nClaimant further observes that Respondent suggests that bifurcation would be appropriate in that it would allow time for the ICC tribunal to reach a decision. Patel argues, however, that the purpose of bifurcation is not to have another tribunal decide issues before this Tribunal61.\n\nResponse, para. 73.\n\n55.\n\nLastly, Patel avers that Respondent should have made the argument that, if the MOI violated Mozambican law, Claimant had failed to make a protected investment, with its objection on the existence of the investment. Respondent, however, chose not to do so, because it knows that the argument on the legality of the MOI is intertwined with the merits and will require the Tribunal to examine substantial expert evidence on Mozambican law. In other words: Respondent's objection is not suited to bifurcation62.\n\nResponse, paras. 74-76.\n\n**e. Fifth Objection: whether Patel exhausted remedies in Mozambique**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nPatel finds that Mozambique's Fifth Objection is not only hard to follow, but also does not appear to be a proper jurisdictional objection63.\n\nResponse, paras. 78-79.\n\n57.\n\nPatel notes that the BIT does not contain any requirement that an investor exhaust local remedies before bringing a claim under the BIT64.\n\nResponse, para. 80.\n\n58.\n\nIn any event, Patel argues that to the extent Mozambique is suggesting that the MOI's arbitration agreement somehow precludes Patel from commencing a treaty claim, the objection is also meritless: it is a well-established principle that an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract does not prevent an investor from commencing a treaty claim, as the causes of action are different65.\n\nResponse, para. 79, referring to Doc. CLA-102 [*Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, paras. 86-116].\n\n59.\n\nIn view of the above, Patel requests that the Tribunal dismiss Respondent's Motion and order Respondent to pay all costs incurred by Patel in connection with this Motion, including interest66.\n\nResponse, para. 81.\n\n**3. ANALYSIS OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. Criteria for bifurcation**\n-------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nBoth Parties agree67 that the Tribunal has discretion to bifurcate jurisdictional questions, *inter alia*, pursuant to Art. 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules68.\n\nMotion, p. 7; Response, para. 14.\n\nArt. 15(1) UNCITRAL Rules: \"Subject to these Rules, the arbitral tribunal may conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, provided that the parties are treated with equality and that at any stage of the proceedings each party is given a full opportunity of presenting his case.\"\n\n61.\n\nThe case law cited by the Parties shows that arbitral tribunals generally consider the following three-factor test when deciding whether to grant bifurcation69:\n\n- Whether the jurisdictional objections raised are *prima facie* serious and substantial;\n\n- Whether any objection to jurisdiction, if granted, will result in a material reduction of the proceedings at the next phase, or would dispose of all or an essential part of the claims; and\n\n- Whether bifurcation is impractical, in that the jurisdictional issue is too intertwined with the merits, making it very unlikely that there will be substantial savings in time or cost.\n\nDoc. CLA-195 [*Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41, Procedural Order No. 2, para. 49]; Doc. CLA-190 [*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised), 31 May 2005, para. 12(c)]; Doc. RL-2 [*Philip Morris Asia Ltd. v. Commonwealth of Australia*, PCA Case No. 2012-12, Procedural Order No 8 on Bifurcation, 14 April 2014, para. 109].\n\n**B. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Parties agree that the bifurcation of jurisdictional objections from merits and quantum has one main goal: to increase the procedural efficiency and economy of the proceeding. Indeed, if a jurisdictional objection is successful, bifurcation will allow for an early termination of the arbitration, sparing the time and cost required to adjudicate the merits and quantum.\n\n63.\n\nThe Parties disagree, however, whether such goal will be attained in the present case:\n\n- While Respondent finds that bifurcation will maximize procedural efficiency, given that the jurisdictional objections are serious and substantial, and can be decided without going into the merits,\n\n- Claimant submits that procedural efficiency militates against bifurcation, because two of Mozambique's jurisdictional objections are intertwined with the merits and will require the Tribunal to review substantial evidence; as to the remaining objections, they are so frivolous that it would be a waste of time and costs to deal with such objections on a preliminary basis.\n\n64.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing Mozambique's objections to jurisdiction in light of the above criteria and in the interests of procedural economy and efficiency, the Tribunal decides not to bifurcate the proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Respondent's First Objection, on the existence of a protected investment, is inextricably intertwined with the merits, Claimant and Respondent holding opposing views as to the occurrence of the relevant facts. To properly adjudicate the First Objection, the Tribunal cannot simply rely on the facts as pleaded by Claimant but will have to review and analyze a significant amount of evidence, including witness and expert evidence, in order to make its own findings. In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that a short, bifurcated procedure is not appropriate for the proper adjudication of the First Objection.\n\n66.\n\nConsidering the Tribunal's decision on the First Objection, the Tribunal decides to join the remaining Objections to the merits.\n\n**C. Decision**\n---------------\n\n67.\n\nIn view of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal decides to:\n\n- Dismiss Mozambique's Motion for Bifurcation;\n\n- Join the jurisdictional objections to the merits and quantum; and\n\n- Direct the Parties to follow the procedural timetable set out in Scenario B of Annex I to Procedural Order No. 1."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 4 (Decision on Respondent\u2019s Stay Application)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2021-11-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 4 (Decision on Respondent\u2019s Stay Application)\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**WHEREAS**\n-----------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration arises between Patel Engineering Limited [\"**Patel**\" or \"**Claimant**\"] and The Republic of Mozambique [\"**Mozambique**\" or \"**Respondent**\"]. Hereinafter, Claimant and Respondent shall be jointly referred to as the \"**Parties**\".\n\n2.\n\nOn 30 October 2020 Claimant filed its Statement of Claim.\n\n3.\n\nOn 20 November 2020 Respondent presented a Motion for Bifurcation, to which Claimant responded on 4 December 2020. On 14 December 2020 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, deciding to dismiss Mozambique\u2019s Motion for Bifurcation and to join the jurisdictional objections to the merits and quantum.\n\n4.\n\nOn 19 March 2021 Respondent filed its Jurisdictional Objections and Statement of Defense. On 9 August 2021 Claimant submitted its Reply on the Merits and Response to Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n5.\n\nOn 1 October 2021 the Tribunal received Respondent\u2019s \"Application for a stay and modification of the procedural timetable (and request for interim suspension of briefing and all deadlines pending the decision on this application)\" [the \"**Application**\"].\n\n6.\n\nOn 7 October 2021 the Tribunal rejected Respondent\u2019s request for an interim suspension of all deadlines pending the decision on the Application, after finding that there was no \"good cause to amend the procedural timetable, since the Tribunal is simply expecting Claimant\u2019s response to Respondent\u2019s Application, which does not impact on Respondent\u2019s preparation of its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction\"1. The Tribunal nevertheless announced that it was minded \"to grant Respondent a two-week extension of the deadline to submit the Rejoinder [on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction], and a corresponding extension to Claimant to file its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction\".\n\nCommunication A 30.\n\n7.\n\nOn 15 October 2021 Claimant filed its Response to Respondent\u2019s Application [\"**Response**\"]. On that same day Respondent asked for an opportunity to reply to Claimant\u2019s argument before the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on the Application.\n\n8.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s communication A 31, on 20 October 2021 Respondent submitted a Reply in support of its Application [\"**Reply**\"], and on 25 October 2021 Claimant submitted a Rejoinder to Respondent\u2019s Reply [\"**Rejoinder**\"].\n\n9.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the Parties\u2019 respective submissions, the Tribunal hereby issues the following procedural order with its Decision on Mozambique\u2019s Application:\n\n**PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 4**\n--------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will start by summarizing the positions of Respondent (**1.**) and Claimant (**2.**) and then adopt its decision (**3.**).\n\n**1.** **P****osition of** **M****ozambique**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nMozambique submits that the present arbitration must be stayed until after the arbitral tribunal in the parallel proceeding No. 25334/JPA before the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce [\"**ICC Tribunal**\" and the \"**ICC Arbitration**\"] determines the existence, validity, and scope of the Parties' contractual rights under the Memorandum of Interest [\"**MOI**\"], given that Patel's Treaty claims are premised and dependent on the validity of the MOI and its underlying contractual rights2.\n\nApplication, paras. 3 and 7; Reply, paras. 1 and 4.\n\n12.\n\nMozambique argues that a stay is necessary to prevent a waste of time and resources given that the ICC Tribunal has uncontested jurisdiction over the local contractual law claims. Additionally, the ICC Tribunal might conclude that it also has jurisdiction to decide on the Treaty claims brought by Patel before this Arbitral Tribunal, as suggested by Mozambique3.\n\nApplication, paras. 22-26.\n\n**A.** **The Tribunal has the authority to stay proceedings and amend the procedural timetable**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nMozambique contends that under Art. 15(1) of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 1976\u00a0[\"UNCITRAL Rules\"] the Tribunal has clear authority and discretion to stay proceedings as it considers appropriate, provided the Parties are treated with equality, have the opportunity to be heard, and do not suffer unreasonable delay. Respondent further asserts that in this case there are no limitations to these broad procedural powers4.\n\nApplication, paras. 35-37.\n\n14.\n\nMoreover, Mozambique avers that pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, the agreed-upon Terms of Appointment, and Art. 23 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal can amend the procedural timetable at any time for \"good cause\", either at the \"reasonable request of any party\" or on its own initiative5.\n\nApplication, paras. 47-49.\n\n15.\n\nMozambique also points out to the International Law Association Recommendations on *Lis Pendens* and Arbitration [\"**ILA Recommendations**\"] and to the *Cairn Energy PLC, Cairn UK Holdings Limited v. The Republic of India* case *[\"****Cairn\"****],* in which the tribunal developed a four-factor test to guide tribunals in exercising their power to stay the proceedings.\n\n**B.** **A stay is sensible and warranted in these circumstances**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nRespondent asserts that all stay requirements found in the UNCITRAL Rules and in non-binding persuasive authority (such as the ILA Recommendations and *Cairn)* are fully satisfied in the present circumstances6:\n\nApplication, para. 50.\n\n17.\n\nFirst, the existence, validity, and scope of the disputed rights under the MOI form the underlying basis for Patel's Treaty claims. According to Mozambique, the MOI (if valid and binding) only offered Patel a *direito de preferencia,* which is not an \"investment\" under Treaty jurisprudence, was in any event no breached, and would not give rise to the lost profit damages Patel seeks. Mozambique's position on the MOI dispute is fatal for Patel's position as to jurisdiction, liability, and damages in this UNCITRAL arbitration. Therefore, Mozambique contends that the resolution of the local contractual law dispute over Patel's alleged \"rights\" under the MOI is material and fundamental to the outcome of this arbitration7.\n\nApplication, paras. 20-21 and 51-67.\n\n18.\n\nSecond, Mozambique argues that a temporary stay is sound case management as it would respect the Parties' MOI arbitration agreement and mitigate the risk of conflicting decisions and cost inefficiencies. Respondent further claims that even if Patel suffers *any* material prejudice - which is difficult to ascertain - it does not outweigh the undeniable and paramount benefits of the stay of these proceedings8.\n\nApplication, paras. 68-76.\n\n19.\n\nThird, each of the four factors identified and developed by the *Cairn* tribunal is met in the present case9:\n\nApplication, paras. 77-79.\n\n20.\n\n*One,* a stay would not create an imbalance between the Parties or violate Patel's right to equal treatment. Rather, the balance of convenience favors a stay since the prejudice caused to Mozambique in continuing this proceeding (given that the ICC Tribunal deciding the local law contractual dispute is a prerequisite to resolution of the Treaty claims) far outweighs whatever prejudice Patel may claim in suspending this arbitration10.\n\nApplication, paras. 80-83.\n\n21.\n\n*Two,* a stay would not deprive Patel of the right to present its case. Patel may present its arguments before the ICC Tribunal on the local law contractual dispute, and thereafter, as appropriate, before this UNCITRAL Tribunal11.\n\nApplication, para. 84.\n\n22.\n\n*Three,* a stay would not delay these proceedings unreasonably. The ICC Secretariat's deadline for a final award in the ICC Arbitration is 29 April 2022. The suspension would thus last for a reasonable period of time according to arbitral jurisprudence12.\n\nApplication, para. 85.\n\n23.\n\n*Four,* the outcome of the ICC Arbitration on the local contractual law dispute is a prerequisite to the outcome of this arbitration. It is necessary to establish the existence of Patel\u2019s alleged contractual rights under the MOI in order to assess any violation of Treaty rights13.\n\nApplication, para. 86.\n\n24.\n\nFinally, Mozambique submits that considerations of economy and efficiency strongly support an interim suspension of all deadlines in these proceedings until after this Tribunal decides on Mozambique\u2019s Application14.\n\nApplication, paras. 91-92.\n\n25.\n\nIn view of the above, Mozambique requests the Tribunal to stay the Arbitration until a final award is made in the ICC Arbitration15.\n\nApplication, para. 97(b).\n\n**2.** **P****osition of** **P****atel**\n----------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondents\u2019 Application to suspend the proceedings should be dismissed since Mozambique fails to justify it as a matter of law or fact16.\n\nResponse, para. 4.\n\n27.\n\nAccording to Patel, Mozambique filed the ICC Arbitration as a tactic to undermine and derail this arbitration, and to manufacture a potential challenge of this Tribunal\u2019s final award. Claimant sustains that the situation, which Mozambique claims creates a risk of inconsistent awards and cost inefficiencies, was deliberately created by the Respondent alone by filing the ICC Arbitration17.\n\nResponse, paras. 5 and 10-19.\n\n28.\n\nClaimant avers that Mozambique fails to define the \"local contractual law dispute\" because there is no *genuine* contractual dispute before the ICC. Rather, Patel argues that Respondent\u2019s defense (exhibits, legal authorities, witness reports, etc.) is essentially identical in the two arbitrations18.\n\nResponse, paras. 20-26.\n\n29.\n\nPatel points out that the ICC Tribunal suspended the entire timetable in the ICC Arbitration pending a decision on its jurisdiction over the so-called \"Treaty-Claims\"19. Patel sustains that this Application is the continuation of Respondent\u2019s obstructive tactics. Claimant notes that while in the ICC Arbitration Mozambique has sought to expediate the proceedings, in this UNCITRAL arbitration Mozambique has made every effort to delay the case20.\n\nResponse, paras. 27-33.\n\nResponse, paras. 34-39.\n\n**A.** **Applicable legal principles**\n--------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nClaimant agrees with Respondent on the applicability of Art. 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the ILA Recommendations, and the *Cairn* standard. Claimant notes, however, that Recommendation 6 - which deals with arbitral tribunals\u2019 discretion to stay their proceedings where the circumstances of the case do not fall within the other specific recommendations, and on which Respondent relies -should only be exercised very sparingly in exceptional circumstances21.\n\nResponse, paras. 40-52.\n\n**B.** **The circumstances of the case militate against a stay of this arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nAccording to Patel, Mozambique has not sufficiently proven that the circumstances of the case meet the test proposed by the *Cairn* tribunal:\n\n32.\n\nFirst, a stay would create an imbalance between the Parties, and/or cause material prejudice to Patel, thereby violating the Parties' right to equal treatment. It would only reward Mozambique's obstructive tactics and prevent Patel from advancing its Treaty claims, which are only before this Tribunal22.\n\nResponse, paras. 54-63; Rejoinder, para. 6.\n\n33.\n\nSecond, a stay would deprive Patel of the right to present its case since the ICC Arbitration is currently suspended indefinitely and to date, Treaty claims are only considered by this Tribunal23.\n\nResponse, paras. 64-68; Rejoinder, para. 4.\n\n34.\n\nThird, a stay would unreasonably delay the UNCITRAL Arbitration. The Parties do not know with certainty when the proceedings before the ICC Tribunal will be resumed and the assumption that a suspension will only delay these proceedings by a few months is unfounded24.\n\nResponse, paras. 69-71; Rejoinder, para. 5.\n\n35.\n\nFourth, the outcome of the ICC Arbitration is not material to the outcome of this arbitration. This Tribunal is not bound by any findings of the ICC Tribunal and is completely independent. Each tribunal has been appointed under different instruments of consent and deals with different causes of action25.\n\nResponse, paras. 72-83; Rejoinder, paras. 2-3.\n\n36.\n\nIn view of the above, Claimant invites the Tribunal to deny Respondent's Application. It further asks the Tribunal to order Respondent to pay all the costs incurred by Claimant in connection with the Application26.\n\nResponse, para. 84.\n\n**3.** **D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** **The Tribunal is empowered to stay the proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArt. 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules\n--------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the Tribunal has the power to stay the proceedings and to amend the procedural timetable, provided the Parties' equality of arms and due process rights are respected. According to the Parties27, this power stems from Art. 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which establishes that:\n\n\"Subject to these Rules, the arbitral tribunal may conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, provided that the parties are treated with equality and that at any stage of the proceedings each party is given a full opportunity of presenting his case.\"\n\nApplication, paras. 35-56; Response, para. 40.\n\nRules in force in the arbitration\n---------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nFurthermore, the Parties agreed in the Terms of Appointment that the arbitration would be conducted in accordance with a procedural timetable, which would be established by the Tribunal in a procedural order and that28:\n\n\"[...] [t]he Tribunal may modify such Procedural Timetable at any time, after consultation with the Parties.\"\n\nTerms of Appointment, paras. 74-75.\n\n39.\n\nLikewise, Procedural Order No. 1 establishes that the procedural timetable may be amended for \"good cause\" at the request of a Party or on the Tribunal's own initiative29.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, para. 8.\n\nILA Recommendations\n-------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Parties also concur that when deciding on Mozambique's Application the Tribunal may be guided by the ILA Recommendations30. Recommendation no. 1 provides that a tribunal that considers itself to be *prima facie* competent should proceed with the arbitration and determine its own jurisdiction, regardless of any other proceedings pending before another arbitration tribunal involving the same parties and substantially the same issues - so-called \"Parallel Proceedings\"31:\n\n\"1. An arbitral tribunal that considers itself to be *prima facie* competent pursuant to the relevant arbitration agreement should, consistent with the principle of competence-competence, proceed with the arbitration ('Current Arbitration') and determine its own jurisdiction, regardless of any other proceedings pending before a national court or another arbitral tribunal in which the parties and one or more of the issues are the same or substantially the same as the ones before the arbitral tribunal in the Current Arbitration ('Parallel Proceedings'). Having determined that it has jurisdiction, the arbitral tribunal should proceed with the arbitration, subject to any successful setting aside application.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nApplication, para. 40; Response, para. 43.\n\nDoc. RLA-143, p. 83.\n\n41.\n\nNevertheless, recommendation no. 2 contains an exception to the above principle32:\n\n\"2. Nevertheless, in the interest of avoiding conflicting decisions, preventing costly duplication of proceedings or protecting parties from oppressive tactics, an arbitral tribunal requested by a party to decline jurisdiction or to stay the arbitration on the basis that there are Parallel Proceedings should decide in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 below.\"\n\nDoc. RLA-143, p. 84.\n\n42.\n\nWhile recommendations no. 3 and 4 deal with parallel court proceedings, recommendation no 5 provides that the second tribunal seized should decline jurisdiction or stay the proceedings in certain cases33:\n\n\"5. Where the Parallel Proceedings have been commenced before the Current Arbitration and are pending before another arbitral tribunal, the arbitral tribunal should decline jurisdiction or stay the Current Arbitration, in whole or in part, and on such conditions as it sees fit, for such duration as it sees fit (such as until a relevant determination in the Parallel Proceedings), provided that it is not precluded from doing so under the applicable law and provided that it appears that:\n\n\u2022 the arbitral tribunal in the Parallel Proceedings has jurisdiction to resolve the issues in the Current Arbitration; and\n\n\u2022 there will be no material prejudice to the party opposing the request because of (i) an inadequacy of relief available in the Parallel Proceedings; (ii) a lack of due process in the Parallel Proceedings; (iii) a risk of annulment or non-recognition or non-enforcement of an award that has been or may be rendered in the Parallel Proceedings; or (iv) some other compelling reason.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. RLA-143, p. 84.\n\n43.\n\nRecommendation no. 6, on the other hand, deals with the tribunal\u2019s residual discretion to stay the proceedings, in cases that do not qualify as \"Parallel Proceedings\", under certain conditions34:\n\n\"6. Also, as a matter of sound case management, or to avoid conflicting decisions, to prevent costly duplication of proceedings or to protect a party from oppressive tactics, an arbitral tribunal requested by a party to stay temporarily the Current Arbitration, on such conditions as it sees fit, until the outcome, or partial or interim outcome, of any other pending proceedings (whether court, arbitration or supra-national proceedings), or any active dispute settlement process, may grant the request, whether or not the other proceedings or settlement process are between the same parties, relate to the same subject matter, or raise one or more of the same issues as the Current Arbitration, provided that the arbitral tribunal in the Current Arbitration is:\n\n\u2022 not precluded from doing so under the applicable law;\n\n\u2022 satisfied that the outcome of the other pending proceedings or settlement process is material to the outcome of the Current Arbitration; and\n\n\u2022 satisfied that there will be no material prejudice to the party opposing the stay.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. RLA-143, p. 84.\n\nThe *Cairn* four-factor test\n----------------------------\n\n44.\n\nFinally, both Parties agree35 that when deciding on the stay of the proceedings, the Tribunal may also find guidance in the four-factor test identified by the *Cairn* tribunal. The *Cairn* tribunal, \"bearing in mind that a stay is an exceptional remedy and that for it to be granted the applicant must provide compelling reasons to show that it is warranted\", considered the following factors36:\n\n- Whether the stay creates an imbalance between the parties, or causes material prejudice to one of the parties, thus violating their right to equal treatment;\n\n- Whether the stay amounts to depriving a party from the right to present its case;\n\n- Whether the stay delays the proceedings unreasonably; and\n\n- Where the stay is premised on the finalization of other pending proceedings, whether the outcome of the other pending proceedings is material to the outcome of the arbitration.\n\nApplication, para. 44; Response, paras. 50 and 53.\n\nDoc. RLA-141, para. 114.\n\n**B.** **Background to Respondent's Application**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nBefore making its decision, the Tribunal will recall some relevant procedural elements to Mozambique's Application.\n\n46.\n\nOn 20 March 2020 Patel filed a Notice of Arbitration against Mozambique, under the UNCITRAL Rules and pursuant to the Agreement between India and Mozambique for the reciprocal promotion and protection of investment [previously defined as the \"Treaty\"].\n\n47.\n\nTwo months later, on 20 May 2020, Mozambique (and the Mozambique Ministry of Transport and Communications) filed a Request for Arbitration with the ICC against Patel under the arbitration agreement contained in the MOI37, giving rise to the ICC Arbitration.\n\nDoc. R-3.\n\n48.\n\nAlthough this Tribunal, once constituted, encouraged the Parties to consolidate the UNCITRAL arbitration and the ICC Arbitration under a single proceeding, the Parties were not able to agree on such consolidation.\n\n49.\n\nTherefore, both the UNCITRAL and the ICC Arbitrations proceeded in parallel38.\n\nHowever, the Parties do not argue that these are \"Parallel Proceedings\" for the purposes of Recommendation 5 of the ILA Recommendations (Response, para. 46; Doc. R-63, para. 83).\n\n50.\n\nOn 4 August 2020 the Parties and this Tribunal signed the Terms of Appointment, in which Mozambique manifested its understanding that39:\n\n\"This dispute must be resolved in the ICC arbitration which can also address any Treaty claims or the ICC arbitration must be concluded first because it pertains to the existence of underlying rights. Notwithstanding the Terms of Appointment, Respondent disputes that the arbitration clause in the Treaty governs this dispute, and by signing these Terms does not waive this contention.\"\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 58 (Summary of Mozambique's claims and relief sought).\n\n51.\n\nOn 14 October 2020, after extensive consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 and the procedural timetable. And on 14 December 2020 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, dismissing Mozambique's Motion for Bifurcation.\n\n52.\n\nOn 20 July 2021, once Claimant's Reply on the Merits was due, the Tribunal was informed that on 21 June 2021 Patel had filed an application to stay the ICC Arbitration until a final award in this arbitration was made40. On 16 August 2021 the ICC Tribunal rejected Patel's stay application41.\n\nCommunication C-17, para. 5.\n\nDoc. R-59.\n\n53.\n\nThereafter, on 1 October 2021 Mozambique filed its Application in the present arbitration, requesting a stay of the proceedings until the ICC Tribunal makes its final award on the basis that42:\n\n- The ICC Tribunal has refused to stay the ICC Arbitration and has held that it has jurisdiction over the Parties' local law contractual dispute under the MOI;\n\n- Patel's Treaty claims are dependent on the validity of the MOI and the existence of contractual rights under the MOI - issues that are pending decision in the ICC Arbitration; and\n\n- The ICC Tribunal may also determine Patel's Treaty claims in the ICC Arbitration and, thus, the present arbitration must be stayed until the ICC Tribunal issues a final award.\n\nSee Section 1 - Position of Mozambique *supra.*\n\n**C.** **A suspension of the proceedings is not warranted**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nAfter duly examining the applicable legal standards and the Parties' positions, the Tribunal considers that there is no good cause to amend the procedural timetable and to stay the proceedings, for several reasons.\n\n55.\n\nFirst, the Parties chose to proceed with two parallel arbitrations. Despite being aware of the existence of these two arbitrations, the Parties agreed on a procedural calendar for this arbitration, over a year ago. The Parties have been complying with this calendar so far. There seems to be no material change of circumstances that warrants a stay of the agreed calendar. In particular, the fact that the ICC Tribunal rejected Patel's stay application in the ICC Arbitration has no bearing over the procedural calendar in this arbitration.\n\n56.\n\nSecond, the stay suggested by Mozambique is equivalent to a *sine die* suspension of the proceedings. Although under the ICC Rules the ICC Tribunal should issue a final award by April 2022, there is no guarantee that such award will be issued by said deadline. Even if it were, the proposed suspension would unreasonably delay the proceedings, considering that the hearing in this arbitration is scheduled to take place precisely in April 2022. Nothing in the applicable legal standards provides for a *sine die* suspension of an ongoing arbitration, particularly when the procedural timetable has been agreed between the Parties and the Tribunal for over a year.\n\n57.\n\nThird, the Tribunal shares the view of the ICC Tribunal that despite the overlap between the two proceedings, a stay of these proceedings pending a decision by another tribunal, constituted on the basis of a different agreement, is not justified43. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the respective causes of action appear to be quite different, considering not only that one proceeding is based on the Treaty and the other one on the MOI, but also that, although the same parties are involved in both arbitrations, their corresponding roles as claimant and respondent are reversed.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\nDoc. R-59.\n\n58.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides to dismiss Mozambique\u2019s Application. The Tribunal reserves a decision on the costs of this procedural incident to a future award.\n\n59.\n\nAs already anticipated in communication A 30, the Tribunal grants Respondent an additional two weeks to file its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction, and a corresponding extension to Claimant to submit its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction. Please find attached Annex I *septies* to Procedural Order No. 1, which reflects the amended procedural timetable."}, {"Title": "Decision on Respondent\u2019s Second Stay Application", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2022-04-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Respondent\u2019s Second Stay Application\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal acknowledges receipt of Mozambique's communications R 39 and R 40, and of Patel's communication C 47, concerning Mozambique's request to stay the present arbitration until after the tribunal in the parallel case before the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce [the \"**ICC Tribunal**\" and the \"**ICC Arbitration**\"] issues the final award regarding the existence, validity and scope of the Parties' contractual rights under the Memorandum of Interest [\"**MOI**\"] [\"**Second Stay Application**\"].\n\n**A.** **Respondent's request**\n-------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nRespondent explains that the ICC Tribunal issued a partial award on jurisdiction [\"**Partial Award**\"]1 and requests the Tribunal to reconsider its earlier decision not to suspend the present arbitration.\n\nDoc. R-92.\n\n3.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that the ICC Tribunal has now finally adjudicated that it has jurisdiction over the Parties' contractual dispute. The ICC Tribunal also held that it lacks jurisdiction over the Parties' treaty dispute. It is Respondent's position, however, that Patel's Treaty claims are dependent on the existence of Claimant's alleged contractual rights under the MOI. Respondent contends that the MOI's arbitration agreement is mandatory on the Parties, with the consequence that all disputes arising out of the MOI should be referred to ICC arbitration2. Consequently, Mozambique argues that these proceedings should be suspended until the ICC Tribunal issues a final award3.\n\nCommunication R 39, p. 4.\n\nCommunication R 39, p. 1.\n\n4.\n\nSecond, Respondent contends that the existence of the Claimant's Treaty claims is contingent on the prior resolution of the Parties' contractual dispute4. Without the contractual rights that Patel asserts, and that Mozambique disputes, there are no local rights to protect under the BIT and Patel can have no Treaty claims. It would be premature for this Tribunal to proceed further before the ICC Tribunal adjudicates the Parties' underlying contractual dispute5.\n\nCommunication R 39, p. 7.\n\nCommunication R 39, p. 8.\n\n5.\n\nThird, Respondent avers that the Partial Award is final and binding, and thus Patel is bound to arbitrate the Parties' underlying contractual dispute before the ICC pursuant to the MOI's arbitration agreement6. This means that Patel has an obligation to agree to immediately suspend this UNCITRAL proceeding (until after the adjudication by the ICC Tribunal of the Parties' underlying contractual dispute) in order to carry out the Partial Award. The Partial Award also constitutes *res judicata* as the dispute is between the same Parties7. Respondent argues that PEL has an obligation to agree to suspend the present proceedings, while the Tribunal must respect the jurisdiction of the ICC Tribunal8.\n\nCommunication R 39, p. 5.\n\nCommunication R 39, p. 5.\n\nCommunication R 39, p. 5.\n\n6.\n\nIn sum, Mozambique considers that the Tribunal should reconsider the decision set out in Procedural Order No. 4 and requests the suspension of this proceeding until after the ICC Tribunal issues the final award on the Parties' contractual dispute9.\n\nCommunication R 39, p. 9.\n\n**B.** **Claimant's response**\n------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent's Second Stay Application is misconceived and points to the Tribunal's decision in Procedural Order No. 4 [the \"**First Stay Decision**\"]10.\n\nCommunication C 47, p. 1.\n\n8.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal has already considered and rejected Mozambique's request to stay this arbitration. Claimant avers that nothing has changed in the five months that have passed between the First Stay Decision and the issuance of the ICC Partial Award. Likewise, Claimant contends that the Partial Award in no way alters the Tribunal's analysis and conclusions in the First Stay Decision11; and that the ICC Tribunal's jurisdiction over the MOI was already \"uncontested\".\n\nCommunication C 47, p. 2.\n\n9.\n\nSecond, Patel argues that Mozambique must demonstrate the substantial and material change of the point at issue12. However, Claimant considers that the basis of Respondent's Second Stay Application is essentially the same as the stay application of 1 October 2021, which the Tribunal found was not warranted13. Mozambique's argument continues to be that the resolution of the local contractual dispute is necessary and constitutes a prerequisite for this arbitration to proceed14.\n\nCommunication C 47, p. 3.\n\nCommunication C 47, p. 2.\n\nCommunication C 47, p. 2.\n\n10.\n\nThird, Claimant notes that both this and the ICC Tribunal concur that the causes of action and instruments of consent are different in each of the proceedings15. Furthermore, Patel argues that Mozambique misconstrues the Partial Award and that the ICC Tribunal never concluded that this Tribunal has any obligation to suspend the present proceedings pending a final award in the ICC Arbitration16. On the contrary, Claimant avers that Respondent's arguments do not withstand scrutiny since17:\n\n- The Partial Award specifically states that nothing in the MOI prevents Patel from pursuing its Treaty claims in this UNCITRAL proceeding;\n\n- The ICC Tribunal considers that both proceedings can continue in tandem harmoniously.\n\nCommunication C 47, p. 4.\n\nCommunication C 47, p. 6.\n\nCommunication C 47, p. 6.\n\n11.\n\nIn sum, Patel requests that this Tribunal reject the Second Stay Application. Two arguments further support this request18:\n\n- The Partial Award confirms the lack of jurisdiction of the ICC Tribunal over Patel's Treaty claims;\n\n- Patel's Treaty claims are only before this Tribunal, while Mozambique's contract claims are only before the ICC Tribunal.\n\nCommunication C 47, p. 8.\n\n**C.** **Arbitral Tribunal's decision**\n---------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nIn the ICC Arbitration (where Mozambique and the Ministry of Transport and Communications [\"**MTC**\"] act as claimants, and Patel as respondent), Mozambique argued that the ICC Tribunal had jurisdiction to decide on the entirety of the relief requested by Mozambique and the MTC, including all declaratory relief relating to the alleged violations of the BIT that are the basis of Patel's claims in the present arbitration19. In turn, Patel recognized the ICC Tribunal's jurisdiction over \"certain contract law claims arising out of the MOI\" but rejected that the arbitration agreement in the MOI could confer jurisdiction to the ICC Tribunal over any Treaty claims20.\n\nPartial Award, para. 113.\n\nPartial Award, para. 122.\n\n13.\n\nThe ICC Tribunal upheld that it had jurisdiction to decide on any \"dispute arising out of the MOI\" but concluded that its jurisdiction did not extend to the Treaty claims21. In particular, the ICC Tribunal found that22:\n\n\"[\u2026] it can, and should, interpret the Arbitration Agreement in a manner that harmoniously respects the jurisdictional realms of both international tribunals, the jurisdiction of which is, respectively based on two separate legal instruments (the MOI and the Treaty) to which the Republic of Mozambique has *prima facie* consented. The Tribunal prefers this approach to one that would expand the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to disputes that are not properly \"arising out of\" the MOI, potentially at the exclusion of, or in collision with, the jurisdiction of the PCA Tribunal. Accordingly, this Tribunal has unquestioned jurisdiction for deciding on any disputes arising out the MOI but no jurisdiction for deciding any disputes arising out of the Treaty.\"\n\nPartial Award, paras. 133 and 154(a).\n\nPartial Award, para. 142.\n\n14.\n\nDespite this outcome, Mozambique argues in the present arbitration that the Tribunal should reconsider its First Stay Decision and suspend these proceedings until the ICC Tribunal has issued its final award. It is Mozambique's position that Patel's Treaty claims are contingent upon the existence of Claimant's alleged contractual rights under the MOI, and for this reason this Tribunal should wait for the ICC Tribunal's final award.\n\n15.\n\nIn its First Stay Decision the Tribunal decided that Mozambique's request for a suspension was not warranted for several reasons:\n\n- First, the Parties consciously chose to proceed with two parallel arbitrations; the Parties agreed on a procedural calendar in the present arbitration and there had been no change of circumstances which could warrant a modification of the agreed calendar23;\n\n- Second, the stay suggested by Mozambique was equivalent to a *sine die* suspension of the proceedings, given the uncertainty as to the date in which the ICC Tribunal would issue the final award; this would lead to an unreasonable delay in the present proceedings24;\n\n- Third, a stay of the proceedings pending a decision by another tribunal, constituted on the basis of a different agreement, was not justified25.\n\nFirst Stay Decision, para. 55.\n\nFirst Stay Decision, para. 56.\n\nFirst Stay Decision, para. 57.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the circumstances have not changed since the First Stay Decision, regardless of the issuance of the ICC Partial Award.\n\n17.\n\nAs expected, the ICC Tribunal upheld jurisdiction over the Parties' contractual claims and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the Treaty claims26. This is because both the ICC Tribunal and this Tribunal concur that the causes of action and instruments of consent are different in each of the proceedings27.\n\nPartial Award, paras. 142 and 154.\n\nPartial Award, para. 142; First Stay Decision, para. 57. See also Doc. R-59.\n\n18.\n\nConsidering that there has not been a change of circumstances, the Tribunal sees no good cause to revisit its First Stay Decision and stay these proceedings, particularly before the hearing on jurisdiction and merits has been held.\n\n19.\n\nThe arbitration shall proceed, with the consequence that Mozambique's Second Stay Application is dismissed."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Suspension)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2022-11-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 6 (Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Suspension)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**WHEREAS**\n-----------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration arises between Patel Engineering Limited [\"**PEL**\" or \"**Claimant**\"] and The Republic of Mozambique [\"**Mozambique**\" or \"**Respondent**\"] under the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of India and Mozambique for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investment dated 19 February 2009 [the \"**BIT**\"]. Hereinafter, Claimant and Respondent shall be jointly referred to as the \"**Parties**\".\n\n2.\n\nThere is a parallel proceeding No. 25334/JPA pending before an arbitral tribunal [the \"**ICC Tribunal**\"] constituted under the Arbitration Rules of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce [the \"**ICC Rules**\"], brought by Mozambique and the Ministry of Transport and Communications [\"**MTC**\"] against PEL [the \"**ICC Arbitration**\"].\n\n3.\n\nOn 16 February 2022 the ICC Tribunal issued a partial award on jurisdiction [\"**ICC Partial Award**\"], deciding, *inter alia*, that1:\n\n\"The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide on the Treaty Claims as circumscribed in Section A.V.\"\n\nICC Partial Award (Doc. R-92), para. 154(a).\n\n4.\n\nThis decision was accompanied by a separate opinion of co-arbitrator Mr. Stephen Anway [\"**Anway Separate Opinion**\"], as follows2:\n\n\"In sum, I agree with the *dispositif* of the Partial Award on Jurisdiction to (i) dismiss Claimants' Treaty Claims, and (ii) deny Claimants' application to enjoin Patel in the UNCITRAL Arbitration. I write separately to make clear my view that it should not be presumed that this Tribunal has the power to police a party's conduct in a different arbitration before a different tribunal or that, if such a power were available to us, it would be appropriate to exercise in this case.\"\n\nAnway Separate Opinion (Doc. R-93), para. 8.\n\n5.\n\nOn 24 November 2022 the ICC Tribunal issued a procedural order enjoining PEL [\"**ICC Injunction**\"]3:\n\n\"[\u2026] from pursuing the determination of any matters in dispute between the Parties arising out of the MOI in any other forum, even if only accessorily for the purpose of the adjudication of Treaty Claims, until this Arbitral Tribunal has taken its decision on those matters.\"\n\nICC Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 14 dated 24 November 2022 [\"**PO 14**\"], para. 101, as amended by the ICC Tribunal's *corrigendum* dated 25 November 2022 [\"**Corrigendum**\"], attached as Annexes I and II.\n\n6.\n\nOn 24 November 2022 Mozambique transmitted the ICC Injunction to the Tribunal, together with Mozambique's application for an emergency order [\"**Third Stay Application**\"]4:\n\n\"[\u2026] confirming these UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings are suspended, in their entirety, until the ICC [Tribunal] issues a final award.\"\n\nCommunication R 61.\n\n7.\n\nOn that same day, PEL sent the dissenting opinion of the ICC Tribunal co-arbitrator Mr. Anway [\"**Anway Dissenting Opinion**\"], who found that5:\n\n\"Today the Majority silences a party before a different, public international law tribunal empowered under a different arbitration agreement. In effect, the Majority's Order deprives that public international tribunal of even hearing that party's submissions. That is a breathtaking proposition.\n\nThe silencing of a party\u2014particularly in a proceeding over which the tribunal issuing the order has no jurisdiction\u2014should concern not only every stakeholder in the ISDS system, but every party concerned with the rule of law. One tribunal's attempt to silence a party before another tribunal, when the claims are brought under different legal instruments, inexorably leads to due process concerns.\n\nIt is not for Mozambique or for the Majority to determine what arguments PEL can and cannot raise before the Treaty Tribunal. For all of the reasons discussed above, I conclude that this Contract Tribunal should simply decide the claims before us, and the Treaty Tribunal should simply decide the claims before it\u2014without interfering with each other's arbitral proceedings.\n\nI dissent.\"\n\nAnway Dissenting Opinion, paras. 88-91, attached as Annex III.\n\n8.\n\nOn Friday, 25 November 2022, the Tribunal took note of the ICC Injunction, the Third Stay Application and the Anway Dissenting Opinion, and decided that6:\n\n\"The hearing is scheduled to commence next Monday morning. Participants are travelling. Therefore, the Tribunal confirms that the hearing will take place. This procedural incident shall be discussed preliminarily first thing on Monday morning. The Parties should be prepared for the full hearing to unfold as scheduled.\"\n\nCommunication A 55.\n\n9.\n\nOn the first day of the evidentiary hearing [\"**Hearing**\"], the Parties presented their comments on the effect of the ICC Injunction and the Third Stay Application. After deliberating, the Tribunal decided to proceed with the Hearing and announced that it would issue a procedural decision with its reasoning.\n\n10.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the Parties' respective submissions, the Tribunal hereby issues the following procedural order with its decision on Mozambique's Third Stay Application:\n\n**PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 6**\n--------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal will briefly summarize the Parties' positions (**1.** and **2.**) before proceeding to its decision (**3.**).\n\n**1.** **R****espondent****'****s position**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nRespondent presented three main points regarding the ICC Injunction.\n\n13.\n\nFirst, Respondent considers that the ICC Injunction binds not only PEL, but also the Tribunal. Respondent cites to the ICC Rules reaffirming the binding nature of the ICC Tribunal's decisions on the Parties7. Respondent further cites to an ICSID decision concerning the *res judicata* effect of the ICC's decisions \"in the international sphere\"8. Respondent notes that the ICC Tribunal's decisions are also binding under Art. 1075 of the Dutch Civil Code, respecting Art. 2 of the New York Convention9.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 25, l. 24 - p. 26, l. 19, citing to Doc. R-94.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 26, l. 20 -p. 27, l. 1, citing to Doc. RLA-160, para. 39.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 27, ll. 2-13.\n\n14.\n\nConsidering the above, Respondent invites the Tribunal to \"immediately suspend this arbitration\" considering the ICC Tribunal's Partial Award and Injunction, and to wait for the ICC Tribunal's final award10. Respondent finds that only by suspending this arbitration would the Tribunal be \"providing [the ICC Tribunal] the proper amount of deference\"11, afford international comity12, and respect its \"sister\" ICC Tribunal's lawful decisions13.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 9, ll. 5-16.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 10, ll. 7-11.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 27, ll. 21-23.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 27, ll. 14-20.\n\n15.\n\nMoreover, Respondent warns that proceeding otherwise would \"injure Mozambique's rights to have the underlying contractual disputes decided\" in the ICC Arbitration, putting Mozambique \"in an untenable position\"14. Respondent submits that to further address the merits of the present arbitration at the Hearing would be to disrespect the ICC Injunction.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 10, ll. 17-22.\n\n16.\n\nSecond, Respondent points to the ICC Partial Award, which found that \"the ICC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine any matters in dispute between the parties arising out of the MOI\", as confirmed by the connected ICC Injunction and as agreed by PEL in the Memorandum of Interest's [\"**MOI**\"] arbitration clause15. Respondent emphasizes that the ICC Partial Award is undoubtedly binding pursuant to the ICC Rules16.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 11, l. 1 - p. 12, l. 10, citing to ICC Injunction, para. 65.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 14, ll. 15-22.\n\n17.\n\nThird, Respondent submits that it is validly entitled to have this arbitration suspended. Respondent indicates that PEL itself admitted that this Tribunal will have to decide on numerous contractual matters in assessing the BIT claims, leaving the ICC Tribunal with \"nothing\". This *prima facie* breaches PEL's obligations under the MOI's arbitration agreement, which confers the ICC Tribunal exclusive jurisdiction over the MOI claims17.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 21, l. 15 - p. 22, l. 3.\n\n**2.** **C****laimant****'****s position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nClaimant's position with respect to the ICC Injunction is also threefold.\n\n19.\n\nFirst, PEL submits that the ICC Injunction contradicts the ICC Tribunal's own Partial Award18. Claimant denies that the ICC Partial Award has the effect of preventing PEL from pursuing the BIT claims in the present arbitration19. The ICC Tribunal itself found that any MOI contractual obligations are \"merely accessory and preliminary questions for determining the [BIT Claims]\" and any consequent remedies under international law20.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 33, ll. 21-22.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 33, ll. 6-10, referring to the Anway Dissenting Opinion, paras. 13 *et seq*.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 33, ll. 11-20, referring to ICC Partial Award, para. 139.\n\n20.\n\nClaimant further submits that the ICC Injunction does not prevent PEL from participating in the Hearing. The ICC Tribunal itself rejected Mozambique's request to that effect, saying it would go \"beyond the bounds of\" the ICC Tribunal's mandate21. The ICC Injunction is an *in personam* order against PEL which does not specifically affect this arbitration22.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 32, ll. 5-13, referring to ICC Injunction, para. 97.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 32, ll. 21-24.\n\n21.\n\nSecond, Claimant considers that the ICC Tribunal's final award is not binding on the present Tribunal anyway, so there is no point in waiting for it. PEL further explains that in the ICC Arbitration Mozambique is only seeking declaratory relief, and is not invoking the protection of its legal rights. Mozambique's remaining claims for putative and nominal damages are tortious, and PEL considers them to be outside the ICC Tribunal's jurisdiction and in any event time barred23. This is what PEL referred to when it was cited by the ICC Tribunal as saying that allowing for this Tribunal to issue its award before the ICC Tribunal would leave the latter with \"nothing\" to decide24. Mozambique's ICC Arbitration case has no substance.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 35, ll. 1-22.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 34, ll. 21-25, and p. 35, l. 23 - p. 36, l. 4.\n\n22.\n\nThird, PEL submits that the ICC Injunction violates its due process rights in an \"incongruous and unprecedented\" way, both under the BIT and Article 10.36 of the Dutch Arbitration Act25. The Injunction seeks to silent Claimant, keep PEL from exercising its right to present its case before a different tribunal empowered by a different legal instrument, and to strip this Tribunal of its *kompetenz-kompetenz*26. PEL is in full agreement with the Anway Dissenting Opinion, which also confirms that \"this type of injunction has never been issued before and directly contravenes 20 years of settled jurisprudence\", exceeding the ICC Tribunal's mandate27.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 38, ll. 14-23.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 36, l. 23 - p. 37, l. 10.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 36, l. 23 - p. 37, l. 10.\n\n23.\n\nTherefore, PEL has asked28:\n\n- That the Tribunal confirm its previous orders (Procedural Order No. 3, Procedural Order No. 4 and A 39); and\n\n- To continue the Hearing as scheduled, provided that the Tribunal, when establishing its jurisdiction, does not feel fettered by the ICC Injunction.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 39, l. 11 - p. 41, l. 8, 20-24.\n\n**2.1 D****ecision of the** **A****rbitral** **T****ribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal is called upon to decide on Mozambique's Third Stay Application.\n\n25.\n\nAs the name indicates, this is not the first time that this Tribunal is addressing an application by Mozambique to suspend the present proceedings. As Mozambique itself has recognized, it \"[\u2026] has consistently insisted that the ICC maintains exclusive jurisdiction\"29 \u2013 and it has also repeatedly requested that this Tribunal suspend these UNCITRAL proceedings.\n\nCommunication R 61.\n\n26.\n\nPEL, in turn, asks the Tribunal to confirm its previous decisions and to clarify its understanding of the effect of the ICC Injunction on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n27.\n\nBefore making its decision (**B.**), the Tribunal will recall some procedural elements relevant to Mozambique's Third Stay Application (**A.**).\n\n**A.** **Background to the Third Stay Application**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nOn 20 March 2020 PEL filed a Notice of Arbitration against Mozambique, under the UNCITRAL Rules and pursuant to the India-Mozambique BIT, asking for30:\n\n\"(a) a declaration that the Respondent has violated its obligations under Article 3 and/or Article 4 and/or Article 5 of the Treaty and/or to its obligations under customary international law;\n\n(b) an order that the Respondent make full reparation to the Claimant for the loss of its investment arising from the Respondent's violations of the Treaty and/or its obligations under customary international law, such reparation being in the form of monetary compensation in an amount to be determined by the Tribunal;\n\n(c) an order that the Respondent pay the costs of this arbitration, including the costs of the Tribunal and the legal costs and expenses of the Claimant including, without limitation, the fees of legal counsel, experts, and fees associated with third party funding;\n\n(d) an order that the Respondent pay interest on any compensation awarded and/or on any legal costs and expenses awarded, in each case at such rate and for such period or periods as the Tribunal shall consider just and appropriate; and\n\n(e) such further or alternative relief as the Tribunal shall consider just and appropriate.\"\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 110.\n\n29.\n\nTwo months later, on 20 May 2020, Mozambique (and the MTC) filed a Request for Arbitration with the ICC against PEL under the arbitration agreement contained in the MOI31, a Request which resulted in the ICC Arbitration. Mozambique (and the MTC) sought declaratory relief with regard to the MOI, and also asked for an award32:\n\n\"280.7 enjoining PEL from proceeding with any other legal proceeding, court action and/or arbitration against Mozambique and/or the MTC that refers or relates to any dispute arising out of the MOI, including the international arbitration initiated by PEL pursuant to the India-MZ BIT. In the alterative, the request[ed] injunction should be granted and remain in place until after this Tribunal finally adjudicates the issues otherwise within its jurisdiction;\"\n\nDoc. R-46.\n\nDoc. R-46, para. 280.7.\n\n30.\n\nBoth the UNCITRAL and the ICC Arbitrations are proceeding in parallel.\n\n31.\n\nOn 4 August 2020 the Parties and this Tribunal signed the Terms of Appointment, in which Mozambique manifested its understanding that33:\n\n\"This dispute must be resolved in the ICC [A]rbitration which can also address any Treaty claims or the ICC [A]rbitration must be concluded first because it pertains to the existence of underlying rights. Notwithstanding the Terms of Appointment, Respondent disputes that the arbitration clause in the Treaty governs this dispute, and by signing these Terms does not waive this contention.\"\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 58 (Summary of Mozambique's claims and relief sought).\n\n32.\n\nOn 14 October 2020, after extensive consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 and the procedural timetable.\n\n33.\n\nOn 14 December 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, deciding to reject Mozambique's request for bifurcation. The Tribunal considered Mozambique's Jurisdictional Objections and concluded that they were best addressed together with the merits. One of these Objections was that PEL had breached the MOI arbitration agreement by instituting the present arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nOn 10 June 2021, PEL filed an application with the ICC Tribunal to stay the ICC Arbitration until a final award is made in the present arbitration34. The ICC Tribunal scheduled a stay application hearing35. PEL argued that Mozambique requests for relief from the ICC Tribunal would be tantamount to it seizing the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Mozambique reaffirmed its position that the ICC Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate all claims, including BIT claims36.\n\nCommunication C 17.\n\nCommunication A 25.\n\nCommunication R 15.\n\n35.\n\nOn 16 August 2021 the ICC Tribunal issued its Procedural Order no. 5 [\"**ICC PO 5**\"], deciding, *inter alia*, that:\n\n- It is \"not convinced that the cause of action of this [ICC A]rbitration is identical to the cause of action of the UNCITRAL Arbitration\"37;\n\n- It is \"not satisfied that 'arbitral efficiency' warrants a stay in [the ICC Arbitration] and/or of any 'exceptional circumstances' that could effectively outweigh [Mozambique's] prejudice in not having this issue resolved timely before a tribunal whose jurisdiction to hear the [Mozambique's] contract claims has been accepted by [PEL]\"38;\n\n- \"PEL has not shown the basis for its assumption that [the ICC Tribunal] should be bound by the decision to be rendered in the UNCITRAL Arbitration\"39;\n\n- It was \"not satisfied that these circumstances would justify staying this proceeding where there is a *prima facie* valid arbitration agreement invoked by [Mozambique] as the basis for [the ICC] Tribunal's jurisdiction, merely upon the fact that the UNCITRAL Tribunal was constituted first\"40.\n\nDoc.

R-59, para. 20.\n\n36.\n\nOn 1 October 2021 the Tribunal received Mozambique's \"Application for a stay and modification of the procedural timetable (and request for interim suspension of briefing and all deadlines pending the decision on this application)\" [\"**First Stay Application**\"]. Mozambique submitted that41:\n\n- The ICC Tribunal had refused to stay the ICC Arbitration and had held that it had jurisdiction over the Parties' local law contractual dispute under the MOI;\n\n- PEL's Treaty claims are dependent on the validity of the MOI and the existence of contractual rights under the MOI \u2013 issues that are pending decision in the ICC Arbitration; and\n\n- The ICC Tribunal may also determine PEL's Treaty claims in the ICC Arbitration and, thus, the present arbitration must be stayed until the ICC Tribunal issues a final award.\n\nSee Procedural Order No. 4, Section 1 \u2013 Position of Mozambique.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal granted PEL the opportunity to respond42.\n\nCommunication A 29.\n\n38.\n\nOn 7 October 2021 the Tribunal rejected Mozambique's request for an interim suspension of all proceedings pending the decision on the First Stay Application, finding that there was no43:\n\n\"[\u2026] good cause to amend the procedural timetable, since the Tribunal is simply expecting Claimant's response to Respondent's Application, which does not impact on Respondent's preparation of its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction.\"\n\nCommunication A 30.\n\n39.\n\nThereafter, PEL filed a response to the First Stay Application on 15 October 2021. On 20 October 2021 Respondent submitted a reply in support of its First Stay Application, and on 25 October 2021 Claimant submitted a rejoinder.\n\n40.\n\nOn 3 November 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 with its decision on the First Stay Application, in which it found no good cause to stay the present proceedings. The Tribunal noted that it shared44:\n\n\"[\u2026] the view of the ICC Tribunal [in ICC PO 5] that despite the overlap between the two proceedings, a stay of these proceedings pending a decision by another tribunal, constituted on the basis of a different agreement, is not justified. In the Tribunal's view, the respective causes of action appear to be quite different, considering not only that one proceeding is based on the Treaty and the other one on the MOI, but also that, although the same parties are involved in both arbitrations, their corresponding roles as claimant and respondent are reversed.\"\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, para. 57, citing to Doc. R-59.\n\n41.\n\nOn 9 February 2022 the ICC Tribunal issued its Partial Award, finding that its jurisdiction excludes PEL's BIT claims and only includes contractual claims related to the MOI45. Particularly, the ICC Tribunal found that46:\n\n\"[\u2026] it can, and should, interpret the Arbitration Agreement in a manner that harmoniously respects the jurisdictional realms of both international tribunals, the jurisdiction of which is, respectively based on two separate legal instruments (the MOI and the Treaty) to which the Republic of Mozambique has *prima facie* consented. The Tribunal prefers this approach to one that would expand the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to disputes that are not properly 'arising out of' the MOI, potentially at the exclusion of, or in collision with, the jurisdiction of the PCA Tribunal.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nICC Partial Award (Doc. R-92), paras. 138-142.\n\nICC Partial Award (Doc. R-92), para. 142.\n\n42.\n\nOn 7 March 2022 Mozambique reiterated its request for the present Tribunal to suspend these proceedings until the ICC Tribunal issues its final award47 [\"**Second Stay Application**\"]. After giving PEL an opportunity to comment and considering both Parties' positions, the Tribunal dismissed Mozambique's Second Stay Application. The Tribunal reaffirmed its decision on the First Stay Application, after finding that there had not been a change of circumstances48.\n\nCommunication R 39\n\nCommunication A 39, paras. 15-16 *et seq*.\n\n43.\n\nMeanwhile, on 18 May 2022 Mozambique again turned to the ICC Tribunal filing an \"Application pursuant to Article 28(1) (Renewing) Request to Enjoin [PEL]\" [\"**Request to Enjoin**\"]. Following several exchanges between the Parties, on 6 September 2022 the ICC Tribunal held a hearing to address Mozambique's Request to Enjoin49.\n\nICC Procedural Order No. 11.\n\n44.\n\nOn 24 November 2022 the ICC Tribunal issued the ICC Injunction. Based on this, Mozambique made its Third Stay Application to the Tribunal50.\n\nCommunication R 61.\n\n**B.** **A suspension of the proceedings is not warranted**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the decision it adopted at the Hearing, after hearing the Parties and deliberating51:\n\n\"There is a basic distinction in the type of disputes which can be resolved by arbitration. There can be international law disputes which derive from a treaty breach and there can be contractual disputes which derive from breaches of contract, and as you know, and as we have said in our previous decisions, this is an international law tribunal constituted under the BIT between India and Mozambique. We are an international law tribunal, and the scope of our jurisdiction is restricted to international law disputes which imply a breach of the obligations assumed by the Republic of Mozambique under its BIT.\n\nThe second point is that we have, as an international law tribunal constituted under the BIT and the UNCITRAL rules, [\u2026] the right and the duty to define our own jurisdiction. This is a basic principle of international arbitration. And to make it very clear, this principle is unaffected, is unfettered by any order issued by any other arbitration tribunal.\n\nThe third point is that we reiterate what we said in our PO3 and PO4 in our previous decisions. There is nothing there which we would like to change at this stage.\n\nFourth, we direct that the hearing should proceed as scheduled if Claimant wishes the hearing to proceed.\"\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 42, l. 17 \u2013 p. 43, l. 23.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal remains convinced that the ICC and UNCITRAL Arbitrations are based on different agreements (*i*.*e*., the MOI and the BIT, respectively) and concern different causes of action. Moreover, although the same parties are involved, they appear in different roles (*i*.*e*., each of them is the claimant in one and the respondent in the other)52.\n\nSee Procedural Order No. 4, para. 57.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal has read the ICC Injunction alongside the ICC Tribunal's previous reasoned decisions, including the ICC Partial Award. The ICC Tribunal has agreed that, despite the overlap which the Parties must manage, the two proceedings remain separate from each other; and, most importantly, that neither Tribunal can interfere with the other's mandate53:\n\n\"[\u2026] the dispute about whether the Republic of Mozambique breached the Treaty and whether any damages are owed under the Treaty is of a different nature. Not only are the *claims* brought on such basis clearly arising out of the Treaty; but also the *dispute* over these issues is arising out of that Treaty, and not properly out of the MOI. Any obligations arising out of the MOI \u2013 and thus any dispute over such obligations \u2013 appear to be, from that perspective, merely accessory and preliminary questions for determining the dispute between the Parties over the alleged violations of the Respondent's rights under the Treaty and thus the availability of remedies provided by that Treaty under international law. Taking aside umbrella clauses, any findings of violations of such public international law would not, in themselves, have any relevance for the existence, validity and enforceability about any obligations under the MOI. In that sense, the dispute between the Parties over the alleged obligations arising out of the Treaty could possibly be considered as a dispute arising 'in connection' or 'relating to' the MOI, but not as 'arising out of' the MOI. [\u2026]\n\n**In the Tribunal's view, the PCA Tribunal alone can decide on its own jurisdiction**. It is equally clear (and undisputed) that the Parties have agreed that they have the right and the obligation to have 'any dispute arising out of this memorandum' under Mozambican law resolved in ICC arbitration. Beyond this, there is no clear language in the Arbitration Agreement in the MOI that suggests that [PEL] has also agreed to refrain from proceeding before the PCA Tribunal in favour of this Tribunal for any dispute arising out of the Treaty, when that Treaty provides for its own dispute settlement mechanism, the scope of which is not for this Tribunal to decide upon.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nICC Partial Award (Doc. R-92), paras. 139 and 141.\n\n48.\n\nIn the ICC Injunction, the ICC Tribunal confirmed this understanding and clarified that it does not intend to stop the present Hearing or proceedings54:\n\n\"It is clear from the above, and in particular from [PEL]'s own persistent affirmation that determination of its claims by the PCA Tribunal would leave this ICC Tribunal with '*really nothing*' to decide, that a provisional measure is warranted. It is also clear that the measure needs to be limited to matters in dispute arising out of the MOI. [Mozambique]'s request for [PEL] to be '*enjoin[ed \u2026] from proceeding with the subject UNCITRAL arbitration until after a final award is issued by this ICC Tribunal in this ICC arbitration*' and to be '*ordered to cease and desist from taking any further actions**, and* *participating in a hearing or in any other manner, in the UNCITRAL arbitration during the pendency of said Interim Measures*' **goes beyond these bounds**. [\u2026]\n\n[Mozambique and MTC] have insisted that any order short of enjoining [PEL] entirely from taking any action, including participating in the hearing before the PCA Tribunal would be ineffective. However, the mutual respect between tribunals (as invoked also in the Partial award) and comity requires this Tribunal not to interfere unduly with the UNCITRAL Arbitration. It is for [PEL] to do what is necessary to bring itself back in line with its obligations resulting from the Arbitration Agreement in the MOI. **And it is for the PCA Tribunal to decide what the consequences of [PEL]'s choices are for its own proceedings**.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nICC Injunction, paras. 97 and 99.\n\n49.\n\nThus, granting Mozambique's Third Stay Application would not only contradict this Tribunal's previous decisions on the same issue \u2013 which the Tribunal entirely confirms, as there has not been a change in circumstances \u2013 but also the ICC Tribunal's intentions.\n\n50.\n\nConferring the ICC Injunction any other interpretation, including one which would have the effect of challenging the Tribunal's *kompetenz-kompetenz*, would run contrary to the ICC Tribunal's *ratio* and to reason.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\n51.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal:\n\n- Rejects Mozambique's Third Stay Application,\n\n- Declares that its right to establish its own jurisdiction is unfettered by the ICC Injunction; and\n\n- Orders that the Hearing and the arbitration proceed as scheduled.\n\nPlace of Arbitration: The Hague, Netherlands\n\nDate: 30 November 2022\n\nAnnexes: - ICC Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 14 dated 24 November 2022 (**I**);\n\n- ICC Tribunal's *corrigendum* dated 25 November 2022 (**II**);\n\n- Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Stephen Anway dated 24 November 2022 (**III**)."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 6 bis (Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Suspension)", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2022-12-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 6 bis (Decision on Respondent\u2019s Request for Suspension)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**WHEREAS**\n-----------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration arises between Patel Engineering Limited [\"**PEL**\" or \"**Claimant**\"] and The Republic of Mozambique [\"**Mozambique**\" or \"**Respondent**\"] under the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of India and Mozambique for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investment dated 19 February 2009 [the \"**BIT**\"].

R-92), para. 154(a).\n\n4.\n\nThis decision was accompanied by a separate opinion of co-arbitrator Mr. Stephen Anway [\"**Anway Separate Opinion**\"], as follows2:\n\n\"In sum, I agree with the *dispositif* of the Partial Award on Jurisdiction to (i) dismiss Claimants' Treaty Claims, and (ii) deny Claimants' application to enjoin Patel in the UNCITRAL Arbitration. I write separately to make clear my view that it should not be presumed that this Tribunal has the power to police a party's conduct in a different arbitration before a different tribunal or that, if such a power were available to us, it would be appropriate to exercise in this case.\"\n\nAnway Separate Opinion (Doc. R-93), para. 8.\n\n5.\n\nOn 24 November 2022 the ICC Tribunal issued a procedural order enjoining PEL [\"**ICC Injunction**\"]3:\n\n\"[\u2026] from pursuing the determination of any matters in dispute between the Parties arising out of the MOI in any other forum, even if only accessorily for the purpose of the adjudication of Treaty Claims, until this Arbitral Tribunal has taken its decision on those matters.\"\n\nICC Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 14 dated 24 November 2022 [\"**PO 14**\"], para. 101, as amended by the ICC Tribunal's *corrigendum* dated 25 November 2022 [\"**Corrigendum**\"], attached as Annexes I and II.\n\n6.\n\nOn 24 November 2022 Mozambique transmitted the ICC Injunction to the Tribunal, together with Mozambique's application for an emergency order [\"**Third Stay Application**\"]4:\n\n\"[\u2026] confirming these UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings are suspended, in their entirety, until the ICC [Tribunal] issues a final award.\"\n\nCommunication R 61.\n\n7.\n\nOn that same day, PEL sent the dissenting opinion of the ICC Tribunal co-arbitrator Mr. Anway [\"**Anway Dissenting Opinion**\"], who found that5:\n\n\"Today the Majority silences a party before a different, public international law tribunal empowered under a different arbitration agreement. In effect, the Majority's Order deprives that public international tribunal of even hearing that party's submissions. That is a breathtaking proposition.\n\nThe silencing of a party\u2014particularly in a proceeding over which the tribunal issuing the order has no jurisdiction\u2014should concern not only every stakeholder in the ISDS system, but every party concerned with the rule of law. One tribunal's attempt to silence a party before another tribunal, when the claims are brought under different legal instruments, inexorably leads to due process concerns.\n\nIt is not for Mozambique or for the Majority to determine what arguments PEL can and cannot raise before the Treaty Tribunal. For all of the reasons discussed above, I conclude that this Contract Tribunal should simply decide the claims before us, and the Treaty Tribunal should simply decide the claims before it\u2014without interfering with each other's arbitral proceedings.\n\nI dissent.\"\n\nAnway Dissenting Opinion, paras. 88-91, attached as Annex III.\n\n8.\n\nOn Friday, 25 November 2022, the Tribunal took note of the ICC Injunction, the Third Stay Application and the Anway Dissenting Opinion, and decided that6:\n\n\"The hearing is scheduled to commence next Monday morning. Participants are travelling. Therefore, the Tribunal confirms that the hearing will take place. This procedural incident shall be discussed preliminarily first thing on Monday morning. The Parties should be prepared for the full hearing to unfold as scheduled.\"\n\nCommunication A 55.\n\n9.\n\nOn the first day of the evidentiary hearing [\"**Hearing**\"], the Parties presented their comments on the effect of the ICC Injunction and the Third Stay Application. After deliberating, the Tribunal decided to proceed with the Hearing and announced that it would issue a procedural decision with its reasoning.\n\n10.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing the Parties' respective submissions, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on 30 November 2022. On that same day, Claimant informed the Tribunal that co-arbitrator Mr. Anway had issued on 29 November 2022 an additional dissenting opinion in light of the Corrigendum7 [\"**Anway Additional Dissenting Opinion**\"]. PEL asked the Tribunal to re-issue Procedural Order No. 6 with the Anway Additional Dissenting Opinion included. Therefore, the Tribunal hereby replaces Procedural Order No. 6 on Mozambique's Third Stay Application by the present Procedural Order No. 6 *bis*, to account for the Anway Additional Dissenting Opinion8:\n\nAnway Additional Dissenting Opinion, attached as Annex IV.\n\nNo other changes were made to the Procedural Order.\n\n**PROCEDURAL ORDER NO. 6** ***BIS***\n------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal will briefly summarize the Parties' positions (**1.** and **2.**) before proceeding to its decision (**3.**).\n\n**1.** **R****espondent****'****s position**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nRespondent presented three main points regarding the ICC Injunction.\n\n13.\n\nFirst, Respondent considers that the ICC Injunction binds not only PEL, but also the Tribunal. Respondent cites to the ICC Rules reaffirming the binding nature of the ICC Tribunal's decisions on the Parties9. Respondent further cites to an ICSID decision concerning the *res judicata* effect of the ICC's decisions \"in the international sphere\"10. Respondent notes that the ICC Tribunal's decisions are also binding under Art. 1075 of the Dutch Civil Code, respecting Art. 2 of the New York Convention11.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 25, l. 24 - p. 26, l. 19, citing to Doc. R-94.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 26, l. 20 -p. 27, l. 1, citing to Doc. RLA-160, para. 39.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 27, ll. 2-13.\n\n14.\n\nConsidering the above, Respondent invites the Tribunal to \"immediately suspend this arbitration\" considering the ICC Tribunal's Partial Award and Injunction, and to wait for the ICC Tribunal's final award12. Respondent finds that only by suspending this arbitration would the Tribunal be \"providing [the ICC Tribunal] the proper amount of deference\"13, afford international comity14, and respect its \"sister\" ICC Tribunal's lawful decisions15.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 9, ll. 5-16.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 10, ll. 7-11.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 27, ll. 21-23.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 27, ll. 14-20.\n\n15.\n\nMoreover, Respondent warns that proceeding otherwise would \"injure Mozambique's rights to have the underlying contractual disputes decided\" in the ICC Arbitration, putting Mozambique \"in an untenable position\"16. Respondent submits that to further address the merits of the present arbitration at the Hearing would be to disrespect the ICC Injunction.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 10, ll. 17-22.\n\n16.\n\nSecond, Respondent points to the ICC Partial Award, which found that \"the ICC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine any matters in dispute between the parties arising out of the MOI\", as confirmed by the connected ICC Injunction and as agreed by PEL in the Memorandum of Interest's [\"**MOI**\"] arbitration clause17. Respondent emphasizes that the ICC Partial Award is undoubtedly binding pursuant to the ICC Rules18.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 11, l. 1 - p. 12, l. 10, citing to ICC Injunction, para. 65.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 14, ll. 15-22.\n\n17.\n\nThird, Respondent submits that it is validly entitled to have this arbitration suspended. Respondent indicates that PEL itself admitted that this Tribunal will have to decide on numerous contractual matters in assessing the BIT claims, leaving the ICC Tribunal with \"nothing\". This *prima facie* breaches PEL's obligations under the MOI's arbitration agreement, which confers the ICC Tribunal exclusive jurisdiction over the MOI claims19.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 21, l. 15 - p. 22, l. 3.\n\n**2.** **C****laimant****'****s position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nClaimant's position with respect to the ICC Injunction is also threefold.\n\n19.\n\nFirst, PEL submits that the ICC Injunction contradicts the ICC Tribunal's own Partial Award20. Claimant denies that the ICC Partial Award has the effect of preventing PEL from pursuing the BIT claims in the present arbitration21. The ICC Tribunal itself found that any MOI contractual obligations are \"merely accessory and preliminary questions for determining the [BIT Claims]\" and any consequent remedies under international law22.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 33, ll. 21-22.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 33, ll. 6-10, referring to the Anway Dissenting Opinion, paras. 13 *et seq*.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 33, ll. 11-20, referring to ICC Partial Award, para. 139.\n\n20.\n\nClaimant further submits that the ICC Injunction does not prevent PEL from participating in the Hearing. The ICC Tribunal itself rejected Mozambique's request to that effect, saying it would go \"beyond the bounds of\" the ICC Tribunal's mandate23. The ICC Injunction is an *in personam* order against PEL which does not specifically affect this arbitration24.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 32, ll. 5-13, referring to ICC Injunction, para. 97.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 32, ll. 21-24.\n\n21.\n\nSecond, Claimant considers that the ICC Tribunal's final award is not binding on the present Tribunal anyway, so there is no point in waiting for it. PEL further explains that in the ICC Arbitration Mozambique is only seeking declaratory relief, and is not invoking the protection of its legal rights. Mozambique's remaining claims for putative and nominal damages are tortious, and PEL considers them to be outside the ICC Tribunal's jurisdiction and in any event time barred25. This is what PEL referred to when it was cited by the ICC Tribunal as saying that allowing for this Tribunal to issue its award before the ICC Tribunal would leave the latter with \"nothing\" to decide26. Mozambique's ICC Arbitration case has no substance.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 35, ll. 1-22.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 34, ll. 21-25, and p. 35, l. 23 - p. 36, l. 4.\n\n22.\n\nThird, PEL submits that the ICC Injunction violates its due process rights in an \"incongruous and unprecedented\" way, both under the BIT and Article 10.36 of the Dutch Arbitration Act27. The Injunction seeks to silent Claimant, keep PEL from exercising its right to present its case before a different tribunal empowered by a different legal instrument, and to strip this Tribunal of its *kompetenz-kompetenz*28. PEL is in full agreement with the Anway Dissenting Opinion, which also confirms that \"this type of injunction has never been issued before and directly contravenes 20 years of settled jurisprudence\", exceeding the ICC Tribunal's mandate29.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 38, ll. 14-23.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 36, l. 23 - p. 37, l. 10.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 36, l. 23 - p. 37, l. 10.\n\n23.\n\nTherefore, PEL has asked30:\n\n- That the Tribunal confirm its previous orders (Procedural Order No. 3, Procedural Order No. 4 and A 39); and\n\n- To continue the Hearing as scheduled, provided that the Tribunal, when establishing its jurisdiction, does not feel fettered by the ICC Injunction.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 39, l. 11 - p. 41, l. 8, 20-24.\n\n**2.1 D****ECISION OF THE** **A****RBITRAL** **T****RIBUNAL**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal is called upon to decide on Mozambique's Third Stay Application.\n\n25.\n\nAs the name indicates, this is not the first time that this Tribunal is addressing an application by Mozambique to suspend the present proceedings. As Mozambique itself has recognized, it \"[\u2026] has consistently insisted that the ICC maintains exclusive jurisdiction\"31 \u2013 and it has also repeatedly requested that this Tribunal suspend these UNCITRAL proceedings.\n\nCommunication R 61.\n\n26.\n\nPEL, in turn, asks the Tribunal to confirm its previous decisions and to clarify its understanding of the effect of the ICC Injunction on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n27.\n\nBefore making its decision (**B.**), the Tribunal will recall some procedural elements relevant to Mozambique's Third Stay Application (**A.**).\n\n**A.** **Background to the Third Stay Application**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nOn 20 March 2020 PEL filed a Notice of Arbitration against Mozambique, under the UNCITRAL Rules and pursuant to the India-Mozambique BIT, asking for32:\n\n\"(a) a declaration that the Respondent has violated its obligations under Article 3 and/or Article 4 and/or Article 5 of the Treaty and/or to its obligations under customary international law;\n\n(b) an order that the Respondent make full reparation to the Claimant for the loss of its investment arising from the Respondent's violations of the Treaty and/or its obligations under customary international law, such reparation being in the form of monetary compensation in an amount to be determined by the Tribunal;\n\n(c) an order that the Respondent pay the costs of this arbitration, including the costs of the Tribunal and the legal costs and expenses of the Claimant including, without limitation, the fees of legal counsel, experts, and fees associated with third party funding;\n\n(d) an order that the Respondent pay interest on any compensation awarded and/or on any legal costs and expenses awarded, in each case at such rate and for such period or periods as the Tribunal shall consider just and appropriate; and\n\n(e) such further or alternative relief as the Tribunal shall consider just and appropriate.\"\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 110.\n\n29.\n\nTwo months later, on 20 May 2020, Mozambique (and the MTC) filed a Request for Arbitration with the ICC against PEL under the arbitration agreement contained in the MOI33, a Request which resulted in the ICC Arbitration. Mozambique (and the MTC) sought declaratory relief with regard to the MOI, and also asked for an award34:\n\n\"280.7 enjoining PEL from proceeding with any other legal proceeding, court action and/or arbitration against Mozambique and/or the MTC that refers or relates to any dispute arising out of the MOI, including the international arbitration initiated by PEL pursuant to the India-MZ BIT. In the alterative, the request[ed] injunction should be granted and remain in place until after this Tribunal finally adjudicates the issues otherwise within its jurisdiction;\"\n\nDoc. R-46.\n\nDoc. R-46, para. 280.7.\n\n30.\n\nBoth the UNCITRAL and the ICC Arbitrations are proceeding in parallel.\n\n31.\n\nOn 4 August 2020 the Parties and this Tribunal signed the Terms of Appointment, in which Mozambique manifested its understanding that35:\n\n\"This dispute must be resolved in the ICC [A]rbitration which can also address any Treaty claims or the ICC [A]rbitration must be concluded first because it pertains to the existence of underlying rights. Notwithstanding the Terms of Appointment, Respondent disputes that the arbitration clause in the Treaty governs this dispute, and by signing these Terms does not waive this contention.\"\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 58 (Summary of Mozambique's claims and relief sought).\n\n32.\n\nOn 14 October 2020, after extensive consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 and the procedural timetable.\n\n33.\n\nOn 14 December 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, deciding to reject Mozambique's request for bifurcation. The Tribunal considered Mozambique's Jurisdictional Objections and concluded that they were best addressed together with the merits. One of these Objections was that PEL had breached the MOI arbitration agreement by instituting the present arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nOn 10 June 2021, PEL filed an application with the ICC Tribunal to stay the ICC Arbitration until a final award is made in the present arbitration36. The ICC Tribunal scheduled a stay application hearing37. PEL argued that Mozambique requests for relief from the ICC Tribunal would be tantamount to it seizing the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Mozambique reaffirmed its position that the ICC Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate all claims, including BIT claims38.\n\nCommunication C 17.\n\nCommunication A 25.\n\nCommunication R 15.\n\n35.\n\nOn 16 August 2021 the ICC Tribunal issued its Procedural Order no. 5 [\"**ICC PO 5**\"], deciding, *inter alia*, that:\n\n- It is \"not convinced that the cause of action of this [ICC A]rbitration is identical to the cause of action of the UNCITRAL Arbitration\"39;\n\n- It is \"not satisfied that 'arbitral efficiency' warrants a stay in [the ICC Arbitration] and/or of any 'exceptional circumstances' that could effectively outweigh [Mozambique's] prejudice in not having this issue resolved timely before a tribunal whose jurisdiction to hear the [Mozambique's] contract claims has been accepted by [PEL]\"40;\n\n- \"PEL has not shown the basis for its assumption that [the ICC Tribunal] should be bound by the decision to be rendered in the UNCITRAL Arbitration\"41;\n\n- It was \"not satisfied that these circumstances would justify staying this proceeding where there is a *prima facie* valid arbitration agreement invoked by [Mozambique] as the basis for [the ICC] Tribunal's jurisdiction, merely upon the fact that the UNCITRAL Tribunal was constituted first\"42.\n\nDoc.

R-59, para. 20.\n\n36.\n\nOn 1 October 2021 the Tribunal received Mozambique's \"Application for a stay and modification of the procedural timetable (and request for interim suspension of briefing and all deadlines pending the decision on this application)\" [\"**First Stay Application**\"]. Mozambique submitted that43:\n\n- The ICC Tribunal had refused to stay the ICC Arbitration and had held that it had jurisdiction over the Parties' local law contractual dispute under the MOI;\n\n- PEL's Treaty claims are dependent on the validity of the MOI and the existence of contractual rights under the MOI \u2013 issues that are pending decision in the ICC Arbitration; and\n\n- The ICC Tribunal may also determine PEL's Treaty claims in the ICC Arbitration and, thus, the present arbitration must be stayed until the ICC Tribunal issues a final award.\n\nSee Procedural Order No. 4, Section 1 \u2013 Position of Mozambique.\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal granted PEL the opportunity to respond44.\n\nCommunication A 29.\n\n38.\n\nOn 7 October 2021 the Tribunal rejected Mozambique's request for an interim suspension of all proceedings pending the decision on the First Stay Application, finding that there was no45:\n\n\"[\u2026] good cause to amend the procedural timetable, since the Tribunal is simply expecting Claimant's response to Respondent's Application, which does not impact on Respondent's preparation of its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction.\"\n\nCommunication A 30.\n\n39.\n\nThereafter, PEL filed a response to the First Stay Application on 15 October 2021. On 20 October 2021 Respondent submitted a reply in support of its First Stay Application, and on 25 October 2021 Claimant submitted a rejoinder.\n\n40.\n\nOn 3 November 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 with its decision on the First Stay Application, in which it found no good cause to stay the present proceedings. The Tribunal noted that it shared46:\n\n\"[\u2026] the view of the ICC Tribunal [in ICC PO 5] that despite the overlap between the two proceedings, a stay of these proceedings pending a decision by another tribunal, constituted on the basis of a different agreement, is not justified. In the Tribunal's view, the respective causes of action appear to be quite different, considering not only that one proceeding is based on the Treaty and the other one on the MOI, but also that, although the same parties are involved in both arbitrations, their corresponding roles as claimant and respondent are reversed.\"\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, para. 57, citing to Doc. R-59.\n\n41.\n\nOn 9 February 2022 the ICC Tribunal issued its Partial Award, finding that its jurisdiction excludes PEL's BIT claims and only includes contractual claims related to the MOI47. Particularly, the ICC Tribunal found that48:\n\n\"[\u2026] it can, and should, interpret the Arbitration Agreement in a manner that harmoniously respects the jurisdictional realms of both international tribunals, the jurisdiction of which is, respectively based on two separate legal instruments (the MOI and the Treaty) to which the Republic of Mozambique has *prima facie* consented. The Tribunal prefers this approach to one that would expand the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to disputes that are not properly 'arising out of' the MOI, potentially at the exclusion of, or in collision with, the jurisdiction of the PCA Tribunal.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nICC Partial Award (Doc. R-92), paras. 138-142.\n\nICC Partial Award (Doc. R-92), para. 142.\n\n42.\n\nOn 7 March 2022 Mozambique reiterated its request for the present Tribunal to suspend these proceedings until the ICC Tribunal issues its final award49 [\"**Second Stay Application**\"]. After giving PEL an opportunity to comment and considering both Parties' positions, the Tribunal dismissed Mozambique's Second Stay Application. The Tribunal reaffirmed its decision on the First Stay Application, after finding that there had not been a change of circumstances50.\n\nCommunication R 39\n\nCommunication A 39, paras. 15-16 *et seq*.\n\n43.\n\nMeanwhile, on 18 May 2022 Mozambique again turned to the ICC Tribunal filing an \"Application pursuant to Article 28(1) (Renewing) Request to Enjoin [PEL]\" [\"**Request to Enjoin**\"]. Following several exchanges between the Parties, on 6 September 2022 the ICC Tribunal held a hearing to address Mozambique's Request to Enjoin51.\n\nICC Procedural Order No. 11.\n\n44.\n\nOn 24 November 2022 the ICC Tribunal issued the ICC Injunction. Based on this, Mozambique made its Third Stay Application to the Tribunal52.\n\nCommunication R 61.\n\n**B.** **A suspension of the proceedings is not warranted**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the decision it adopted at the Hearing, after hearing the Parties and deliberating53:\n\n\"There is a basic distinction in the type of disputes which can be resolved by arbitration. There can be international law disputes which derive from a treaty breach and there can be contractual disputes which derive from breaches of contract, and as you know, and as we have said in our previous decisions, this is an international law tribunal constituted under the BIT between India and Mozambique. We are an international law tribunal, and the scope of our jurisdiction is restricted to international law disputes which imply a breach of the obligations assumed by the Republic of Mozambique under its BIT.\n\nThe second point is that we have, as an international law tribunal constituted under the BIT and the UNCITRAL rules, [\u2026] the right and the duty to define our own jurisdiction. This is a basic principle of international arbitration. And to make it very clear, this principle is unaffected, is unfettered by any order issued by any other arbitration tribunal.\n\nThe third point is that we reiterate what we said in our PO3 and PO4 in our previous decisions. There is nothing there which we would like to change at this stage.\n\nFourth, we direct that the hearing should proceed as scheduled if Claimant wishes the hearing to proceed.\"\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 42, l. 17 \u2013 p. 43, l. 23.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal remains convinced that the ICC and UNCITRAL Arbitrations are based on different agreements (*i*.*e*., the MOI and the BIT, respectively) and concern different causes of action. Moreover, although the same parties are involved, they appear in different roles (*i*.*e*., each of them is the claimant in one and the respondent in the other)54.\n\nSee Procedural Order No. 4, para. 57.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal has read the ICC Injunction alongside the ICC Tribunal's previous reasoned decisions, including the ICC Partial Award. The ICC Tribunal has agreed that, despite the overlap which the Parties must manage, the two proceedings remain separate from each other; and, most importantly, that neither Tribunal can interfere with the other's mandate55:\n\n\"[\u2026] the dispute about whether the Republic of Mozambique breached the Treaty and whether any damages are owed under the Treaty is of a different nature. Not only are the *claims* brought on such basis clearly arising out of the Treaty; but also the *dispute* over these issues is arising out of that Treaty, and not properly out of the MOI. Any obligations arising out of the MOI \u2013 and thus any dispute over such obligations \u2013 appear to be, from that perspective, merely accessory and preliminary questions for determining the dispute between the Parties over the alleged violations of the Respondent's rights under the Treaty and thus the availability of remedies provided by that Treaty under international law. Taking aside umbrella clauses, any findings of violations of such public international law would not, in themselves, have any relevance for the existence, validity and enforceability about any obligations under the MOI. In that sense, the dispute between the Parties over the alleged obligations arising out of the Treaty could possibly be considered as a dispute arising 'in connection' or 'relating to' the MOI, but not as 'arising out of' the MOI. [\u2026]\n\n**In the Tribunal's view, the PCA Tribunal alone can decide on its own jurisdiction**. It is equally clear (and undisputed) that the Parties have agreed that they have the right and the obligation to have 'any dispute arising out of this memorandum' under Mozambican law resolved in ICC arbitration. Beyond this, there is no clear language in the Arbitration Agreement in the MOI that suggests that [PEL] has also agreed to refrain from proceeding before the PCA Tribunal in favour of this Tribunal for any dispute arising out of the Treaty, when that Treaty provides for its own dispute settlement mechanism, the scope of which is not for this Tribunal to decide upon.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nICC Partial Award (Doc. R-92), paras. 139 and 141.\n\n48.\n\nIn the ICC Injunction, the ICC Tribunal confirmed this understanding and clarified that it does not intend to stop the present Hearing or proceedings56:\n\n\"It is clear from the above, and in particular from [PEL]'s own persistent affirmation that determination of its claims by the PCA Tribunal would leave this ICC Tribunal with '*really nothing*' to decide, that a provisional measure is warranted. It is also clear that the measure needs to be limited to matters in dispute arising out of the MOI. [Mozambique]'s request for [PEL] to be '*enjoin[ed \u2026] from proceeding with the subject UNCITRAL arbitration until after a final award is issued by this ICC Tribunal in this ICC arbitration*' and to be '*ordered to cease and desist from taking any further actions**, and* *participating in a hearing or in any other manner, in the UNCITRAL arbitration during the pendency of said Interim Measures*' **goes beyond these bounds**. [\u2026]\n\n[Mozambique and MTC] have insisted that any order short of enjoining [PEL] entirely from taking any action, including participating in the hearing before the PCA Tribunal would be ineffective. However, the mutual respect between tribunals (as invoked also in the Partial award) and comity requires this Tribunal not to interfere unduly with the UNCITRAL Arbitration. It is for [PEL] to do what is necessary to bring itself back in line with its obligations resulting from the Arbitration Agreement in the MOI. **And it is for the PCA Tribunal to decide what the consequences of [PEL]'s choices are for its own proceedings**.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nICC Injunction, paras. 97 and 99.\n\n49.\n\nThus, granting Mozambique's Third Stay Application would not only contradict this Tribunal's previous decisions on the same issue \u2013 which the Tribunal entirely confirms, as there has not been a change in circumstances \u2013 but also the ICC Tribunal's intentions.\n\n50.\n\nConferring the ICC Injunction any other interpretation, including one which would have the effect of challenging the Tribunal's *kompetenz-kompetenz*, would run contrary to the ICC Tribunal's *ratio* and to reason.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\n51.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal:\n\n- Rejects Mozambique's Third Stay Application,\n\n- Declares that its right to establish its own jurisdiction is unfettered by the ICC Injunction, and\n\n- Orders that the Hearing and the arbitration proceed as scheduled.\n\nPlace of Arbitration: The Hague, Netherlands\n\nDate: 2 December 2022\n\nAnnexes: - ICC Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 14 dated 24 November 2022 (**I**);\n\n- ICC Tribunal's *corrigendum* dated 25 November 2022 (**II**);\n\n- Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Stephen Anway dated 24 November 2022 (**III**);\n\n- Additional Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Stephen Anway dated 29 November 2022 (**IV**)."}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2024-02-07T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Guido Santiago Tawil", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Guido Santiago Tawil\n------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded, by majority, that Claimant has only made pre-investment expenditures that do not qualify as protected investments under the BIT and, therefore, that it lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to adjudicate the claims submitted by PEL in this case1.\n\n*See* Final Award, paras. 347, 385, 391, and 424.\n\n2.\n\nI respectfully disagree with the view of my esteemed colleagues.\n\n3.\n\nPEL was encouraged by Mozambique to invest in the country. It developed a project and, on 6 May 2011, entered into a binding agreement with the Government (the MOI) which, while obliging PEL to perform some tasks, provided Claimant with specific rights, including the alleged right to obtain the concession of the Project2.\n\nClause 2 of the English version of the original MOI provided by PEL (Doc. C-5A) reads:  \n1. **PEL** shall carry out a prefeasibility study (PFS) on the basis of the report of the working group for assessing the appropriate site of the port and to finalize the rail route thus ensuring that once the terms under Clause 7 [technical and commercial viability] of this memorandum are approved, the Govt. of Mozambique shall issue a concession of the project in favour of **PEL.**  \n2. After the approval of the prefeasibility study **PEL** shall have the first right of refusal for the implementation of the project on basis of the concession which will be given by the Government of Mozambique. [Emphasis added]\n\n4.\n\nPEL prepared and submitted the PFS, which was approved by the MTS on 15 June 20123. Although PEL informed Respondent three days later that it was exercising its right of first refusal4, the implementation of the project was not possible due to the negative of CFM (an entity of the Respondent) to invest in the Project and incorporate a company jointly with PEL as requested by the MTC when approving the PFS5.\n\nDoc. C-11, MTC's letter dated 15 June 2012. Consistent with the idea that the MOI implemented a direct award procedure, the MTC\u00b4s communication stated that: \"[\u2026] in order to pursue the project, Patel Engineering Ltd must: (a) Expressly exercise its right of first refusal; (b) Negotiate with the CFM the creation of a company to implement the project\".\n\nDoc. C-12, PEL's letter dated 18 June 2012.\n\nDaga I, para. 85; Daga II, para. 101.\n\n5.\n\nLater on, on 18 April 2013, PEL received an invitation from the Council of Ministers6 to \"start the process with a view of carrying out these projects\", that initiated a process to directly negotiate the terms of the Project's concession with PEL7.\n\nThe Council of Ministers is Mozambique's highest executive decision-making body. It is composed of the President, the Prime Minister and all of Mozambique's ministers. See Doc. CLA 48a, Constitution of the Republic of Mozambique (as amended in 2018), Art. 201.\n\nThe MTC's 18 April 2013 letter (Doc. C-29) states:  \nThe Council of Ministers, in its 10th Ordinary Session held on the date of 16 April 2013, considering the urgency of these infrastructures, the national strategic interest, the time available and the fact that the tenderer has carried out all the feasibility and engineering studies, and that it is in the national interest that the project be accelerated, decided to invite this company to start the process with a view of carrying out those projects.  \nTherefore, the representatives of Patel Engineering Ltd. are invited to contact the Ministry of Transport and Communications, to begin this process, within seven days.  \nIt is also requested that the company prepare for the project, within thirty days, a bank guarantee corresponding to zero point one per cent (0.1%) of the volume of the investment foreseen for the respective enterprise and keep it valid until the conclusion of the contract, at which time the same shall be returned to the contracted entity.  \nThe company must also present a statement, agreement or *take or pay* memorandum with mining companies, in order to make the project in question feasible. [Emphasis added].  \nThe April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision made no reference to the MOI.\n\n6.\n\nPEL expressed its interest in participating in such process and provided the MTC with the requested bank guarantee in the amount of USD 3,115,0008. However, less than a month later and before PEL could present a statement, agreement, or take-or-pay memorandum with mining companies to initiate the negotiations, it was informed by the MTC, on 13 May 2013, that the Council of Ministers had decided not to proceed with the direct negotiation of the concession with PEL9.\n\nDaga I, para. 129; Daga II, para. 141; Doc. C-33, PEL's letter dated 9 May 2013.\n\nDoc. C-34, MTC's 13 May 2013 letter.\n\n7.\n\nThere is no doubt that Claimant's activities were aimed at obtaining a concession agreement, that Respondent assumed specific commitments to such end, and that both processes were frustrated for reasons foreign to PEL and allegedly attributable to Respondent (*i.e.*, the CFM decision not to invest in the Project and the Council of Ministers' May Decision reversing the offer made to PEL less than a month before).\n\n8.\n\nThe consequences of such decisions and the scope of rights that PEL alleges were illegitimately frustrated should have been, among many others, matters of debate in the present arbitration.\n\n9.\n\nThrough both the MOI and the April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision, Respondent provided PEL with a particular status that had an economic value and clearly differentiated Claimant from prospective investors as those participating in the Public Tender. At the time of the bid, PEL had made different contributions to develop the Project10 and through Respondent's assurances in the MOI and the April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision, what could be considered before as mere expectations crystallized into rights that had an economic value and should, in my view, be considered protected by the Treaty.\n\nAs part of its investment in the Project, Claimant mentioned \"(i) the right to a direct award of a concession and the rights under the MOI associated with the Project; (ii) the transfer of information, data and know-how to Mozambique; (iii) PEL's input into and payment for the Preliminary Study; and (iv) the detailed PFS which Mozambique approved, and which later served as the basis for the irregular tender process which ultimately ended in the award of the Project to ITD\" (C III, para. 218).\n\n10.\n\nSuch rights were *acquired* by PEL directly from Mozambique through the MOI and the April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision and, in my view, qualify within the definition of \"every kind of asset established or acquired\" as investments protected by Article 1 (b) of the Treaty11. The Treaty provides an ample definition of the protected investments and arbitral tribunals shall make no distinctions where the Parties to the Treaty have not.\n\nWhich include \"in particular, though not exclusively \u2026 (iii) rights\u2026to any performance under contract having a financial value; (iv) intellectual property rights in accordance with the relevant laws of the respective Contracting Party [and] (v) business concessions conferred by law or under contract\u2026\" (Treaty, Art. 1 (b)).\n\n11.\n\nPEL's investment process was by no means \u2013 following the wording of the *Nordzucker v. Poland* tribunal \u2013 \"a mere intention to invest which existed only in the mind of the potential investor\"12. Mozambique was not only perfectly aware of such process but actively encouraged PEL and engaged in its investment process.\n\n*Nordzucker v. Poland*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 10 December 2008, para. 185.\n\n12.\n\nNeedless to say, it is not my view that ordinary pre-investments activities shall *per se* be considered protected by investment treaties. PEL was not a simple participant in the Public Tender (as all the other bidders that participated in it) nor a prospective investor exploring potential opportunities. As mentioned before, initially through the MOI and later through the April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision PEL was conferred with a different status from all other participants. Such special status had an economic value and allegedly encompassed certain rights.\n\n13.\n\nTherefore, even if the Tribunal was to conclude that PEL's alleged rights do not qualify as a protected investment under the BIT (a view with which I do not agree), the active engagement of Mozambique in the promotion of its investment and the assurances provided to PEL during such process obliged Respondent to treat them fairly and equitably13 in accordance with Article 3 of the Treaty14.\n\n*See* similar conclusion arrived at by the *Nordzucker* tribunal:  \nBased on the above reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that:  \n(1) the investments in the Szczecin and Gd\u00e1nsk Groups have not been admitted by Poland in accordance with its law and therefore as a matter of principle do not enjoy the protection of the BIT according to article 2 (1) second sentence;  \n(2) as Poland was aware of these intended or envisaged investments and had actually solicited them and actively followed and supervised the procedure for sale of the assets up to (the second before) the last step, Poland had not only an obligation to promote them as far a(s) possible and to admit them in accordance with its law but also to treat them fairly and equitably in accordance with article 2(1) third sentence [...]  \n*See Nordzucker*, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 10 December 2008, para. 218.\n\nArticle 3 of the Treaty provides:  \n(1) Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in its territory, and admit such investments in accordance with its laws and policy.  \n(2) Investments and returns of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\n14.\n\nThe ICC Arbitration is of a contractual basis and clearly differs from the dispute before us, based on the alleged violations of the Treaty. While I expect that PEL will be granted a full opportunity to present its claims before the ICC Tribunal, it was this Treaty arbitration the natural fora in which such claims should have been discussed.\n\n15.\n\nIn light of the decision adopted by the majority to admit Mozambique's objection *ratione materiae*, and to render moot the remainder of the Parties' submissions on jurisdiction, liability, and quantum, I will issue no opinion concerning other matters raised by the Parties in this case.\n\n**Date**: 7 February 2024"}], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Administrative Costs** | Fees and expenses of the arbitrators, of the appointing authority, of any other assistance required by the tribunal, and the expenses of the PCA, under paras.

On the same date, Respondent objected to the Tribunal's decision and reserved its right to make additional submissions once it received Claimant's additional submission on damages valuation.\n\n96.\n\nOn 18 May 2022, Claimant informed the Tribunal that Respondent had filed its sixth application under the ICC Arbitration to enjoin Claimant from proceeding with the present arbitration, reserving its right to claim costs based on the Respondent's actions.\n\n97.\n\nOn 20 May 2022, Respondent objected to Claimant's communication to the Tribunal, reiterating its allegation that Claimant wrongfully continued to pursue the present arbitration despite the jurisdictional finding in the ICC Arbitration.\n\n98.\n\nOn 30 May 2022, Claimant submitted its Additional Submission on Quantum [\"**C IV**\"], together with:\n\n- Exhibits C-381 to C-389;\n\n- Legal authorities CLA-75A, and CLA-322 to CLA-347; and\n\n- Expert report CER-8.\n\n99.\n\nOn 10 June 2022, Respondent submitted a motion objecting to Claimant's introduction of two additional expert witness reports, along with the expert report included as an attachment therein, and the supplemental submission on quantum.\n\n100.\n\nOn 17 June 2022, Claimant submitted its response to Respondent's motion, together with exhibits C-390 and C-391, and legal authorities CLA-348 to CLA-351.\n\n101.\n\nOn the same date, Claimant notified the Tribunal that the tribunal in the ICC Arbitration had issued a procedural order requesting additional pleadings on whether Claimant should be enjoined from proceeding with the present arbitration. Claimant submitted a copy of its submission in the ICC Arbitration dated 15 June 2022, in which it opposed Mozambique's application to enjoin PEL from proceeding with the present arbitration.\n\n102.\n\nOn 7 July 2022, the Tribunal dismissed Respondent's motion of 10 June 2022, *inter alia* allowing the Additional Submission on Quantum and admitting into the record the corresponding expert reports.\n\n103.\n\nOn 26 August 2022, Respondent submitted its Response to Claimant's Additional Submission on Quantum [\"**R III**\"], together with expert reports RER-13, RER-14, and RER-15 and the experts' corresponding exhibits.\n\n104.\n\nOn 29 August 2022, the Tribunal decided to adopt a cut-off date for submissions regarding procedural incidents, other than submissions regarding the organization of the Hearing, to allow all participants to prepare for the Hearing.\n\n105.\n\nOn 29 August 2022, Respondent notified the Tribunal that the ICC Tribunal would be holding a hearing regarding its motion to enjoin PEL from proceeding with the present arbitration, also notifying of the possibility of submitting one or two additional motions *in limine*.\n\n106.\n\nOn 1 September 2022, the Tribunal reiterated that it had established a cut-off date (29 August 2022) for the Parties to present new submissions in order to fully allow all participants to prepare for the Hearing and to preserve procedural efficiency. The Tribunal further noted that it would grant both Parties, at the beginning of the Hearing, an opportunity to orally submit any new issues, which may have arisen after the cut-off date.\n\n**7. Hearing preparations**\n---------------------------\n\n107.\n\nOn 28 April 2022, the PCA informed the Parties that the Tribunal had decided to hold the Hearing in Porto, Portugal.\n\n108.\n\nOn 6 October 2022, the PCA sent a letter to the Tribunal and the Parties concerning the organization of the Hearing and other logistical arrangements. On 10 October 2022, the Tribunal circulated to the Parties draft Procedural Order No. 5 governing the organization of the Hearing and invited the Parties to submit their comments.\n\n109.\n\nOn 13 October 2022, Claimant provided its comments on the PCA's communication of 6 October 2023 concerning the organization of the Hearing. On the same day, Respondent submitted its comments on the same communication. On 19 October 2022, the Parties submitted their joint comments on draft Procedural Order No. 5.\n\n110.\n\nOn 21 October 2022, Respondent submitted a letter identifying its witnesses who are expected to appear at the Hearing in person and virtually. On the same date, Claimant sent a letter listing its witnesses who are anticipated to testify remotely at the Hearing.\n\n111.\n\nOn 25 October 2022, the Tribunal and the Parties held a Pre-Hearing Conference via video-conference.\n\n112.\n\nOn 28 October 2022, Respondent indicated the names of its attendees at the Hearing in addition to the witnesses it previously identified, and listed the witnesses who are likely to make use of simultaneous interpretation between English and Portuguese. On the same date, Claimant submitted the list of its participants for the Hearing, as well as the name of its witness who will require interpretation at the Hearing.\n\n113.\n\nOn 3 November 2022, the PCA circulated on behalf of the Tribunal a draft press release to inform the general public about the Hearing and invited the Parties' comments on the draft.\n\n114.\n\nOn 4 November 2022, the Parties submitted their respective comments on the PCA's correspondence of 6 October 2022 concerning Hearing logistics. On the same date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, which included a tentative Hearing agenda.\n\n115.\n\nOn 7 November 2022, Claimant proposed amendments to the draft press release circulated by the PCA.\n\n116.\n\nOn 8 November 2022, Claimant requested clarification from the Tribunal regarding procedural matters relating to the Hearing, which was provided by the Tribunal on 16 November 2023.\n\n117.\n\nOn 9 November 2022, the PCA noted that no comments had been received from Respondent regarding the draft press release. Accordingly, on 10 November 2022, the PCA published on its website a press release in English and in Portuguese, informing the public about the Hearing and arrangements that had been put in place for members of the public to attend it.\n\n118.\n\nOn 18 November 2022, Claimant asked leave from the Tribunal to refer to additional documents at the Hearing and submitted copies of the proposed exhibits.\n\n119.\n\nOn 19 November 2022, Respondent objected to Claimant's request of 18 November 2022. On the same date, Claimant submitted its response to Respondent's objection.\n\n120.\n\nOn 22 November 2022, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would postpone its decision on Claimant's request of 18 November 2022 to the end of the first Hearing-day. On the same date, Claimant wrote to the Tribunal regarding the Hearing agenda and the order of examination of the witnesses. Respondent submitted its comments thereafter.\n\n121.\n\nOn 23 November 2022, Respondent submitted further comments on the Hearing agenda and the availability of one of its experts to attend the Hearing in person. On the same date, Claimant submitted its response to Respondent's comments, which was followed by a reply from Respondent.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its decision on the Claimant's request of 18 November 2022 to refer to additional documents at the Hearing at the end of the first Hearing day, on 28 November 202217.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 246, l. 16 to p. 248, l. 11.\n\n**8. Third Stay Application**\n-----------------------------\n\n123.\n\nOn 24 November 2022, Respondent transmitted to the Tribunal a copy of a procedural order issued by the ICC Tribunal on the same date [the \"**ICC Injunction**\"], together with a new application for a stay of the present proceedings [\"**Third Stay Application**\"]. On the same date, Claimant sent to the Tribunal a copy of the dissenting opinion to the ICC Injunction, authored by co-arbitrator Stephen P. Anway from the ICC Tribunal [\"**Anway Dissenting Opinion**\"].\n\n124.\n\nOn 25 November 2022, the Tribunal confirmed that the Hearing would take place and that the Third Stay Application would be discussed at the beginning of the Hearing.\n\n125.\n\nAt the start of the Hearing on 28 November 2022, Respondent raised a point of order, reiterating that the Tribunal should grant its Third Stay Application18. Later, Claimant submitted its views on the Third Stay Application and reiterated that the Tribunal should reject the Third Stay Application and, thus, proceed with the Hearing19.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 7, l. 22 to p. 30, l. 2.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 30, l. 23 to p. 42, l. 2.\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal issued its decision on the Third Stay Application during the Hearing on 28 November 2022, rejecting the Third Stay Application, declaring that its right to establish its own jurisdiction was unfettered by the ICC Injunction, and ordering that the Hearing and the present arbitration proceed as scheduled. The Tribunal further noted that it would render in due course a reasoned written statement explaining the Tribunal's decision20. Respondent reserved its rights and stated that it would proceed with the Hearing under protest21.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 42, l. 18 to p. 44, l. 2.\n\nHT, Day 1, p. 45, l. 12 to p. 45, l. 23.\n\n127.\n\nOn 30 November 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, providing its reasons for its decision to reject the Third Stay Application and proceed with the Hearing.\n\n128.\n\nOn 2 December 2022, following an application from Claimant, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 *bis*, which replaced Procedural Order No. 6, to account for an addendum to the ICC Injunction and an additional dissenting opinion issued on 29 November 2022 by Mr. Anway in the ICC Arbitration. The Tribunal maintained its prior ruling in regard to Respondent's Third Stay Application.\n\n**9. Hearing**\n--------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Hearing was held from 28 November to 3 December 2022 and from 5 to 6 December 2022 at the *Pal\u00e1cio da Bolsa* in Porto, Portugal.\n\n130.\n\nThe following persons attended the Hearing:\n\n**The Arbitral Tribunal:**\n\nJuan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto (Presiding Arbitrator)   \nGuido Santiago Tawil   \nHugo Perezcano D\u00edaz\n\n**For Claimant:**\n\nKishan Daga\n\n*Party Representative & Factual Witness*\n\nSarah Vasani  \nLindsay Reimschussel  \nDaria Kuznetsova\n\n*CMS Cameron McKenna Nabarro Olswang*\n\n*LLP*\n\nBaiju Vasani\n\n*20 Essex Chambers*\n\nSofia Martins  \nRenato Guerra de Almeida  \nRicardo Saraiva\n\n*Miranda & Associados*\n\nEdward Ho\n\n*Brick Court Chambers*\n\nAshish Patel (*by video conference*)\n\n*Factual Witness*\n\nRui Medeiros  \nKiran Sequeira  \nPaul Baez  \nDavid Dearman  \nAndrew Comer (*by video conference*)\n\n**For Respondent:**\n\nAngelo Matusse\n\n*Party Representative*\n\nJuan Basombrio  \nTheresa Bevilacqua  \nDaniel Brown\n\n*Dorsey & Whitney LLP*\n\nLuis Amandio Cha\u00faque  \nPaulo Francisco Zucula\n\n*Factual Witnesses*\n\nTeresa F.

Post-Hearing submissions**\n--------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nOn 12 December 2022, the Tribunal directed the Parties to discuss and propose the deadlines for the correction of the Hearing transcripts, the post-hearing briefs, and submissions on costs.\n\n133.\n\nOn 20 December 2022, the Parties submitted their proposed timeline for the post-hearing procedure.\n\n134.\n\nOn 23 December 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, providing directions to the Parties on the post-hearing procedure.\n\n135.\n\nOn 27 January 2023, the Parties submitted their proposed corrections to the Hearing transcripts together with a list of disputed corrections and redactions. The Parties also agreed to mark portions of Mr. Zucula's testimony at the Hearing as confidential.\n\n136.\n\nOn 6 February 2023, the Tribunal issued its decision on the disputed corrections and redactions to the Hearing transcripts.\n\n137.\n\nOn 7 February 2023, in response to an invitation from the Tribunal to establish a supplementary deposit of USD 300,000, Respondent requested (i) that \"PEL pay Mozambique's half of the supplementary deposit\", and (ii) \"confirmation that any payments Mozambique may make to the PCA in the future do not constitute a waiver of any of Mozambique's rights or arguments with respect to jurisdiction or PEL's violation of the ICC injunction\".\n\n138.\n\nOn 11 February 2023, Claimant opposed Respondent's request of 7 February 2023. It further noted that Respondent had filed in the ICC Arbitration an unsolicited \"Updated Damages Statement\", seeking to submit claims for damages which included \"all fees and expenses incurred in the UNCITRAL Arbitration\" and \"offset [of] damages against any adverse UNCITRAL Award\". Claimant submitted a copy of that submission in the ICC Arbitration as exhibit C-408.\n\n139.\n\nOn the same date, the Court Reporters circulated the corrected Hearing transcripts [\"**Hearing Transcript**\" or \"**HT**\"].\n\n140.\n\nOn 13 February 2023, the Tribunal ordered Claimant to make a substitute payment for Respondent's share of the supplementary deposit, in accordance with Art. 41(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal further confirmed that any deposit payment made in this case would not be deemed by this Tribunal to be a waiver of any of the Parties' rights or arguments in relation to the Tribunal's jurisdiction or PEL's alleged violation of its obligation in the ICC Arbitration.\n\n141.\n\nOn 16 February 2023, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to extend the deadline to submit the post-hearing briefs and refrain from citing or including hearing materials from the hearing in the ICC Arbitration that took place on 20-24 February 2023. The Parties further asked the Tribunal to confirm this agreement. On the following day, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties' agreement.\n\n142.\n\nOn 19 February 2023, Claimant asked for additional time until April 2023 to make the substitute payment ordered by the Tribunal on 13 February 2023.\n\n143.\n\nOn 21 February 2023, the Tribunal ordered Claimant to make the substitute payment by 13 March 2023 and directed the Parties to make a new supplementary deposit by 3 April 2023.\n\n144.\n\nOn 4 March 2023, the Parties submitted their respective post-hearing briefs [\"**CPHB**\" and \"**RPHB**\"].\n\n145.\n\nOn 17 March 2023, PCA acknowledged receipt of the substitute payment requested by the Tribunal on 13 February 2023.\n\n146.\n\nOn 7 April 2023, PCA noted that it had not yet received the supplementary deposit requested by the Tribunal on 21 February 2023.\n\n147.\n\nOn 13 April 2023, Claimant requested an extension until 15 May 2023 to transfer its share of the supplementary deposit to the PCA.\n\n148.\n\nOn 18 April 2023, Tribunal granted Claimant's request for additional time and directed it to make a substitute payment for Respondent's share of the supplementary deposit by 15 May 2023.\n\n149.\n\nOn 16 May 2023, PCA acknowledged receipt of Claimant's share of the supplementary deposit requested by the Tribunal on 21 February 2023.\n\n150.\n\nOn 23 May 2023, Claimant asked for an extension until 7 July 2023 to make a substitute payment for Respondent's share of the supplementary deposit and asked whether the Tribunal had questions for the Parties, and, if not, to set a deadline for the Parties' submissions on costs.\n\n151.\n\nOn 29 May 2023, Tribunal (i) granted the time extension requested by Claimant to make the substitute payment, and (ii) confirmed it had no additional questions for the Parties. Nevertheless, the Tribunal noted that it would wait for Claimant to pay the outstanding share of the deposit before fixing the date for the Statements of Costs.\n\n152.\n\nOn 7 July 2023, the PCA acknowledged receipt of Claimant's substitute payment and confirmed that the supplementary deposit requested by the Tribunal on 21 February 2023 had been paid in full. On the same date, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their respective Statements of Costs by 31 July 2023.\n\n153.\n\nOn 10 July 2023, the Parties jointly requested for an extension of time until 18 August 2023 to submit their respective Statements of Costs. On 11 July 2023, the Tribunal approved this request.\n\n154.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, the Parties filed their respective Statements of Costs [respectively, for Claimant and Respondent, \"**C SofC**\" and \"**R SofC**\"]. Claimant marked certain of its exhibits and an expert report as confidential and stated that the C SofC should be redacted for publication.\n\n155.\n\nOn 19 September 2023, Claimant submitted its proposed redactions to its C SofC [the \"**SofC Redacted**\"], Index to Claimant's Factual Exhibits, and Schedule of Costs.\n\n156.\n\nBy letter of 28 September 2023, Respondent objected to Claimant's proposed redactions, arguing that they are untimely and improper, and reserved \"all rights regarding the inappropriate new evidence submitted with [the SofC]\". On the following day, the Tribunal invited Claimant to provide comments on Respondent's letter.\n\n157.\n\nOn 6 October 2023, Claimant provided its comments on Respondent's letter of 28 September 2023, requesting the Tribunal to order the PCA to publish the redacted version of C SofC, Index to Claimant's Factual Exhibits, and Schedule of Costs.\n\n158.\n\nOn 27 November 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 granting Claimant's request to redact certain excerpts of the C SofC and its annexes.\n\n159.\n\nOn 20 January 2024, Claimant informed the Tribunal that the ICC Tribunal expects to submit its draft award to the ICC Court by 29 February 2024.\n\n160.\n\nOn 24 January 2024, the Tribunal took note of the Claimant's correspondence of 20 January 2024. The Tribunal further noted that it had finalized its deliberations and that an electronic copy and original paper copies of its decision, signed by the arbitrators in counterparts, would be communicated to the Parties. Finally, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThis arbitration was initiated by Patel Engineering Limited, an India-based engineering company22, against the Republic of Mozambique, for alleged breaches of the Indian-Mozambique BIT, in relation to Claimant's alleged pre-concession rights over a tentative coal-export project in Mozambique.\n\nDoc. C-162, p. 6.\n\n**1. The Project**\n------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe project consisted in creating a rail line that would run from a site reportedly rich in coal reserves near Moatize, in the Tete province, rich in coal reserves, to a location near the village of Macuse, a coastal village in the Mozambique Channel. The project also envisioned the construction of a port infrastructure near Macuse, from which coal could be exported [the \"**Project**\"]23.\n\nDoc. C-4A, internal p. 4; Daga I, para. 16; C I, para. 57.\n\n163.\n\nIn early 2011 Claimant engaged the Ministry of Planning and Development [the \"**MPD**\"] and the Ministry of Transport and Communication [previously defined as the \"**MTC**\"] of the Government of Mozambique to discuss the proposed Project and enquire whether the Government was interested in entering into a public-private partnership [\"**PPP**\"]24.\n\nDaga I, para. 21; Zucula I, para. 3; Doc. C-199; HT, Day 3, p. 570, ll. 14-18 (Zucula). *See* also Doc. C-55; Doc. C-3.\n\n164.\n\nIn the course of these discussions, Minister Paulo Zucula, of the MTC, expressed interest in the Project and required PEL to commission a preliminary study that would determine the appropriate location for the port infrastructure. The Minister informed PEL that the preliminary study should involve the participation of officials from the MTC and its costs should be covered by PEL25.\n\nDaga I, paras. 21-25; Daga II, paras. 15-17.\n\n165.\n\nIn March 2011 two MTC specialists, Dr. Isaias Abreu Muhate and Mr. Jafar M.C. Ruby, issued a 30-page \"**Preliminary Study**\"26, acknowledging PEL's \"contribution and support\" to the study and concluding that a port in Macuse would enjoy \"comparative advantages\" over the other locations surveyed27.\n\nDoc. C-4A.\n\nDoc. C-4A, internal p. 21. *See* also Daga I, para. 31.\n\n166.\n\nThereafter, Minister Zucula confirmed that the next step would be for PEL and Mozambique to enter into a memorandum of interest [previously defined as the \"**MOI**\"] for Claimant to carry out a pre-feasibility study in relation to the Project [the \"**Pre-Feasibility Study**\"]28.\n\nDaga I, para. 33; Daga II, para. 22; Patel I, para. 35. *See* also HT, Day 3, p. 573, ll. 11-22 and p. 604, ll. 16-19 (Zucula).\n\n**2. The MOI**\n--------------\n\n167.\n\nOn 6 May 2011 PEL and the MTC signed a six-page MOI, in which PEL undertook to carry out the Pre-Feasibility Study for the Project within 12 months29, at its own cost30. If the study proved the technical and economical pre-feasibility of the Project, the Government would initiate the next phase, concerning the negotiation and eventual award of a concession contract, where PEL would enjoy a \"*direito de prefer\u00eancia*\" (in the Portuguese version of the MOI) or \"first right of refusal\" (in the English version of the MOI) for the development of the Project31.\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 3.\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 4.\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 2.\n\n168.\n\nThe Parties have presented the following signed copies of the MOI:\n\n- PEL's and Mozambique's respective signed original MOI in Portuguese \u2013 both being identical [the \"**Portuguese MOI**\"]32;\n\n- Mozambique's scanned copy of the English version [\"**Respondent's English MOI**\"]33, which represents a literal translation of the Portuguese MOI; this is a scanned copy of another copy of the MOI (not of an original copy34); and\n\n- PEL's original copy of the English version [\"**Claimant's English MOI**\"]35, which differs from the other versions in several key terms, including Clause 2(1).\n\nDoc. C-5B and Doc. R-1.\n\nDoc. R-2.\n\nHT, Day 4, p. 751, l. 17 to p. 752, l. 3 (Cha\u00faque).\n\nDoc. C-5A.\n\n**A. Different versions of the MOI**\n------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nA parenthesis must be opened at this stage concerning the different versions of the MOI on the record of these proceedings \u2013 a point of much contention between the Parties throughout the arbitration.\n\n170.\n\nThe evidence shows that PEL \u2013 assisted by its Mozambican legal counsel to ensure compliance with Mozambican law36 \u2013 produced the first drafts of the MOI in English, with the goal of obtaining a \"30-year concession from the time the rail and port are operational\"37 to be granted to PEL \"after the feasibility study\"38.\n\nDaga I, para. 35; Patel I, para. 34.\n\nDoc. C-220.\n\nDoc. C-201, Attachment, p. 1.\n\n171.\n\nBut the Mozambican Government required the MOI to be signed in Portuguese39 and, thus, on 18 April 2011 Claimant produced a first version of the MOI translated into Portuguese40.\n\nC I, paras. 105-106; R I, para. 43; Daga I, para. 38; Doc. C-5A; Doc. C-5B.\n\nDaga II, para. 28; Doc. C-202.\n\n172.\n\nThroughout April and May the parties negotiated the text of the MOI. And on 5 May 2011 representatives of the Parties met to agree on a final Portuguese text41. A \"final revised version\" of the Portuguese MOI was sent to PEL in the early morning of 6 May 2011 by Mr. Rafique Jusob, the head of the Mozambican Centre for Promotion of Investments, who noted that PEL had to \"finalize the English version accordingly\"42. PEL was satisfied with this \"final revised version\"43, which corresponds, by and large, to the text of Claimant's English MOI44.\n\nDaga I, para. 42.\n\nDoc. C-204; HT, Day 2, p. 407, l. 6 to p. 410, l. 12.\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 414, l. 12 to p. 415, l. 12 (Daga).\n\n*See* Doc. C-204; H-17, pp. 17-20.\n\n173.\n\nAt 11 am on 6 May 2011 the Parties' representatives convened to sign the MOI, but Minister Zucula had to delay the meeting45. At the Hearing, PEL explained that when the parties eventually signed the MOI, around 6 pm on that same 6 May 2011, PEL's Portuguese-speaking advisor was no longer present46. Respondent's representatives presented four copies of the MOI for signature: two in Portuguese and two in English. In this arbitration PEL says that Respondent's representatives confirmed at the meeting that both the English and Portuguese copies were the latest versions containing the terms agreed47. Both Parties then signed two copies of each48 version .\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 410, l. 4 to p. 411, l. 24 (Daga).\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 413, l. 15 to p. 415, l. 1 (Daga).\n\nDaga I, para. 45; HT, Day 2, p. 411, ll. 4-24 (Daga).\n\nDaga I, para. 46.\n\n174.\n\nBut the Portuguese MOI that was signed by the Parties differs in several key provisions from the \"final revised version\" circulated by Mr. Rafique in the early hours of 6 May 2011 \u2013 and corresponds literally to Respondent's English MOI. None of the Parties has been able to explain exactly what happened between the morning of 6 May 2011 and that same afternoon; yet it is clear that a new version of the Portuguese MOI was prepared and eventually signed by both Parties.\n\n175.\n\nMr. Kishan Daga, PEL's representative (who does not speak Portuguese), does not deny that he signed the Portuguese MOI but denies that he ever signed Respondent's English MOI49. Minister Zucula, in turn, has recognized that his signature in Claimant's English MOI is authentic50.\n\nHT, Day 2, p. 438, ll. 22-23 (Daga).\n\nHT, Day 3, p. 586, l. 9 to p. 587, l. 3 (Zucula).\n\n176.\n\nAlthough Mozambique's public officials have recognized under oath that all documents signed by the MTC are filed in the Minister's office, Mozambique has failed to marshal an original copy of its English MOI and has offered no satisfactory explanation for this failure51.\n\nHT, Day 3, p. 582, l. 17 to p. 583, l. 13 (Zucula); HT, Day 4, p. 751, ll. 11-23 (Cha\u00faque).\n\n**B. The terms of the MOI**\n---------------------------\n\n177.\n\nWhy is the previous discussion relevant? Because the Parties disagree on the applicable version of the MOI:\n\n- While PEL relies on Claimant's English MOI;\n\n- Mozambique contends that the controlling documents are the Portuguese MOI and Respondent's English MOI.\n\n**a. Undisputed provisions**\n----------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe key (and undisputed) terms of the MOI are the following:\n\n- PEL shall carry out the Pre-Feasibility within 12 months52, at its own cost53;\n\n- The MTC shall provide the information and permissions necessary for PEL to undertake the Pre-Feasibility Study54;\n\n- The MTC agrees that \u2013 during the preparation of the Pre-Feasibility Study and up to its approval \u2013 it will not solicit other studies for the feasibility of the Project from third parties; and it will abstain from granting to third parties any rights or authorizations for the implementation of the key infrastructures of the Project55;\n\n- The parties agree to keep all information exchanged, including the MOI, confidential until the approval of the Project56;\n\n- If the Project57 is found \"techno commercially unviable\"58, the parties agree to sign a new memorandum for a similar project; and\n\n- Any dispute arising out of the MOI is subject to ICC arbitration seated in Mozambique59.\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 3.\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 4.\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 5.\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 6.\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 11.\n\nSee Doc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 6 and 7: \"[\u2026] the corridor from Tete to the province of Zambezia within the area referred under objective of the present memorandum.\"\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 7.\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 10.\n\n**b. Disputed Provision**\n-------------------------\n\n179.\n\nClause 2 of the MOI governs the MTC's approval of the Pre-Feasibility Study and the consequences that follow such approval.\n\n180.\n\nThe English versions of the MOI are drafted in different terms:\n\nRespondent's English MOI and the Portuguese MOI\n\n181.\n\nRespondent's English MOI provides the following60:\n\n\"1. **PEL** shall carry out a pre-feasibility study (PFS) within 12 months and will submit to the government for the respective approval.\n\n2. After the approval of the prefeasibility study **PEL** shall have the first right of refusal for the implementation of the project on basis of the concession which will be given by the Government of Mozambique\".\n\nDoc. R-2, Clause 2(1). *See* also Zucula I, paras. 11-16.\n\n182.\n\nThe Portuguese MOI aligns with Respondent's English MOI61:\n\n\"*1. A PEL realizar\u00e1 um estudo de pr\u00e9-viabilidade (EPV), dentro de 12 meses que submeter\u00e1 ao Governo para a respectiva aprova\u00e7\u00e3o.*\n\n*2. Aprovada a pr\u00e9-viabilidade do empreendimento, a PEL ter\u00e1 o direito de prefer\u00eancia para implementa\u00e7\u00e3o do projecto na base da Concess\u00e3o a ser outorgada pelo Governo*\".\n\nDoc. C-5B; Doc. R-1.\n\n183.\n\nThe documents on which Respondent relies, thus, state that, once the Pre-Feasibility Study is approved, Claimant will have a \"first right of refusal\" (in Portuguese, a \"*direito de prefer\u00eancia*\") to implement the Project \"on basis of the concession which will be given by the Government of Mozambique\".\n\nClaimant's English MOI\n----------------------\n\n184.\n\nClause 2 of Claimant's English MOI states that62:\n\n\"1. **PEL** shall carry out a prefeasibility study (PFS) on the basis of the report of the working group for assessing the appropriate site of the port and to finalize the rail route thus ensuring that once the terms under Clause 7 of the memorandum are approved, the Govt. of Mozambique shall issue a concession of the project in favour of **PEL**.\n\n2. After the approval of the prefeasibility study **PEL** shall have the first right of refusal for the implementation of the project on basis of the concession which will be given by the Government of Mozambique\".\n\nDoc. C-5A, Clause 2.\n\n185.\n\nThe document on which Claimant relies, thus, states that, once the Pre-Feasibility Study is approved, the Government:\n\n- \"shall issue a concession\" for the Project in favor of PEL; and simultaneously,\n\n- PEL shall have a \"first right of refusal\" (in Portuguese a \"*direito de prefer\u00eancia*\") to implement the Project \"on basis of the concession which will be given by the Government of Mozambique\".\n\n**3. The Pre-Feasibility Study**\n--------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nA year after signing the MOI, in May 2012, PEL presented the results of its Pre-Feasibility Study to technical and commercial personnel from the MTC, the MPD, the Ministry of Finance, the Directorate of Ports and Railways, and the Government's chosen entity for participation in the Project, the Mozambican State-owned railroad operator [\"**CFM**\"]63. Eventually, after some technical clarifications64, on 15 June 2012, the MTC informed Claimant that it had approved the Pre-Feasibility Study [the \"**June 2012 Approval**\"], and that65:\n\n\"[\u2026] in order to pursue the project, Patel Engineering Ltd. must:\n\n(a) Expressly exercise its right of first refusal;\n\n(b) Negotiate with the CFMs the creation of a company to implement the project.\"\n\nDaga I, para. 78; Doc. R-8.\n\nDaga II, para. 75; Doc. C-8; Doc. C-9; Doc. C-10.\n\nDoc. C-11. *See* also HT, Day 3, p. 605, l. 25 to p. 606, l. 3 (Zucula).\n\n187.\n\nOn 18 June 2012 PEL expressed to the MTC its desire to execute the Project by \"expressly exercis[ing] [its] right of preference\", and informed that it would engage the railroad operator CFM to incorporate an entity for the implementation of the Project66.\n\nDoc. C-12; Daga I, para. 76.\n\n188.\n\nBetween June and August 2012 PEL approached the CFM to negotiate the terms of the partnership and the subsequent negotiation and signature of a concession agreement67:\n\n\"We would like to request you [CFM] to kindly let us know how we can proceed further in regard to the formation of SVP between PATEL and CFM for the above-mentioned project. We shall be highly obliged to receive your advice letter for formation of SVP so that we can enter into the second phase of the project for discussion and signing of concession agreement as per MOI [\u2026].\"\n\nDoc. R-13.\n\n189.\n\nHowever, a deal never materialized, because the CFM did not have sufficient funds to invest and therefore could not pay for the 20% equity stake in the Project that Claimant was offering68.\n\nDaga I, para. 85; Daga II, para. 101.\n\n**4. The start of the public tender**\n-------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nClaimant was not the only company interested in developing the Project.\n\n191.\n\nOther mining and construction companies submitted to the Government their own PPP proposals to develop similar projects69.\n\nDoc. C-59; Doc. C-230, para. 7.\n\n192.\n\nIn August 2012 the Prime Minister of Mozambique instructed the creation of a \"Working Group composed of the Ministers of the Economic Area\" (including, *inter alia*, the MTC and the Ministry of Mineral Resources), to address all proposals made in a consistent manner and offer a solution on how the project should be adjudicated70. The Working Group acknowledged that71:\n\n- There had been six \"manifestations of interest\" for the development of the main infrastructure of the Project from six different companies: Rio Tinto, PEL, Micaune Investment, Jindal Mozambique Minerals, Euroasian Natural Resources Corporation and China Road and Bridge Corporation72; and\n\n- The Government required a \"consistent and coherent positioning\" and should not respond in isolation to the individual proposals, but rather \"analyze all the manifestations of interest\"73.\n\nDoc. C-230, para. 1.\n\nDoc. C-230.\n\nDoc. C-230, para. 7.\n\nDoc. C-230, para. 7.\n\n193.\n\nThe conclusions of the Working Group were that74:\n\n- All \"pre-feasibility studies of the proposals submitted\" should be collected; and\n\n- The Government should launch a public tender, which was the standard regime for PPP contracting under Law No. 15/2011 [the \"**PPP Law**\"]75 and Decree No. 16/2012 [the \"**PPP Regulation**\"], which had been recently adopted on 4 July 201276.\n\nDoc. C-230, para. 9.\n\nDoc. RLA-6 (POR); Doc. CLA-65A (ENG).\n\nDoc. RLA-7 (POR); Doc. CLA-64 (ENG).\n\n194.\n\nIn November 2012 the Mozambican Government and the CFM announced in the press their intention to initiate an international public tender for the Macuse railway and port project77.\n\nDaga II, para. 111; Doc. C-231; Daga II, para. 159; Doc. C-235.\n\n195.\n\nOn 28 November 2012 PEL wrote to Minister Zucula explaining why it considered it should be awarded a direct concession for the Project on the basis of the MOI and the Pre-Feasibility Study it had prepared proving the viability of its proposed Project78.\n\nDoc. C-18; Daga I, para. 91.\n\n196.\n\nClaimant's efforts to revert the Government's decision to initiate a public tender continued through January 2013, when PEL requested a meeting with Minister Zucula to discuss, *inter alia*, the creation of a joint venture with the CFM and the direct award of the project to that joint venture79.\n\nDoc. C-232; Daga II, para. 114.\n\n197.\n\nOn 11 January 2013 the MTC communicated to Claimant that a public tender would be organized; and that, as Claimant had been unable to forge a partnership with CFM for a direct award, Claimant's right of preference pursuant to the MOI and the PPP Law would be materialized through a scoring advantage in the public tender80.\n\nDoc. C-19, p. 2.\n\n198.\n\nOn 30 January 2013, Respondent published a request for expressions of interest to acquire the rights of concession for the Project81. Over twenty companies submitted expressions of interest82.\n\nDoc. C-236.\n\nClaimant states that 21 companies submitted expressions of interest, whereas Respondent places the number at 25. *See* C I, para. 203; R I, para. 116; Doc. R-22; Doc. R-23.\n\n199.\n\nPEL decided to form a consortium with Grindrod Limited and SPI, through which it could participate in the public tender [the \"**PGS Consortium**\"]83; and on 8 March 2013 the PGS Consortium submitted an expression of interest84, in which it stated that the PGS Consortium's participation in the public tender did not constitute a waiver of PEL's rights under the MOI85.\n\nDaga I, para. 123; Daga II, para. 124; Doc. C-60.\n\nDoc. R-24; Daga I, para. 124.\n\nDoc. R-24.\n\n200.\n\nUltimately, the MTC invited six companies to participate in the public tender, including the PGS Consortium86.\n\n*See* C II, para. 204.\n\n201.\n\nOn 12 April 2013 the MTC issued to the six participants the \"**Tender Documents**\"87 and established a deadline of 29 May 2013 for the submission of technical and financial proposals88.\n\nDoc. C-27; Daga I, para. 125.\n\nDoc. C-27.\n\n**5. The April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nAlthough the public tender had been put in motion, only one week later, on 18 April 2013 the Council of Ministers took the opposite decision: based on the \"urgency\" of the infrastructure and its \"national strategic interest\" it \"decided to invite\" PEL \u2013 as the tenderer that had prepared the Pre-Feasibility Study \u2013 to \"start the process with a view of carrying out these projects\"89 [the \"**April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision**\"]. Minister Zucula sent a communication to Claimant informing it of the Decision. The Council of Ministers thus, decided to initiate a process to directly negotiate the terms of the concession of the Project with PEL. To start the negotiations, PEL was required, within 30 days, to90:\n\n- Provide a bank guarantee amounting to 0.1% of value of the Project; and\n\n- Present a statement, agreement, or take-or-pay memorandum with mining companies.\n\nDoc. C-29.\n\nDoc. C-29.\n\n203.\n\nOn 23 April 2013 PEL responded to the MTC and formally accepted the offer to commence negotiations as per the terms of the April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision91.\n\nDoc. C-30.\n\n204.\n\nOn 9 May 2013 Claimant provided the MTC with the required bank guarantee, in the amount of USD 3,115,00092. But before PEL could present a statement, agreement or take-or-pay memorandum with mining companies to initiate the negotiations with the MTC, the Government reconsidered the direct negotiations approach and decided to continue with the ongoing public tender process.\n\nDaga I, para. 129; Daga II, para. 141; Doc. C-33.\n\n**6. The May 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nIndeed, less than one month after inviting PEL to engage in direct negotiations, the Government pulled back on its offer \u2013 without offering any explanation of its change of opinion. On 13 May 2013 the MTC sent Claimant a new communication stating that, after hearing several stakeholders of the Project and reviewing the legal and regulatory PPP framework, the Council of Ministers had come to the conclusion that the public tender was the correct option for adjudicating the Project [the \"**May 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision**\"]93. The MTC encouraged PEL to continue in the bidding, where it would enjoy a \"preference right from the 15 percentage points stipulated by Law\", and proceeded to return Claimant's bank guarantee, posted just some days before94.\n\nDoc. C-34.\n\nDoc. C-34.\n\n206.\n\nPEL protested against this decision, to no avail95. The public tender, thus, continued its course.\n\nDoc. C-35; Doc. R-28; Daga I, paras. 133-134; Daga II, para 144.\n\n**7. The result of the public tender**\n--------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, the PGS Consortium \u2013 led by PEL \u2013 submitted its financial and technical proposals within the tender process96.\n\nDaga I, para. 140; Daga II, para. 147; Doc. C-37.\n\n208.\n\nIn the competitive tender process, Claimant's consortium enjoyed a 15% scoring advantage with respect to the other bidders during the evaluation process of the offers97.\n\nDoc. C-234.\n\n209.\n\nDespite that initial lead, PGS Consortium's offer proved not to be sufficiently attractive, pursuant to the technical and economical parameters set in the Tender Documents and evaluated by the MTC's Acquisition Management and Execution Office [\"**Evaluation Committee**\"] in charge of scoring the bidders.\n\n210.\n\nOn 15 July 2013 the Evaluation Committee issued its concluding report, ranking in the first place the offer made by ITD. PGS Consortium's proposal was graded as the third preferred option98.\n\nDoc. C-234.\n\n211.\n\nThe PGS Consortium made several informal complaints to the MTC regarding the tender process99; but ultimately, on 27 August 2012 the MTC gave final confirmation to the PGS Consortium that there being no pending \"*recursos*\" (or appeals) the tender was adjudicated to ITD100. And on the following day, the PGS Consortium filed a formal administrative appeal against the tender process101. But the MTC informed the PGS Consortium that there had been no inconsistency in its application of the tender scoring provisions102.\n\nDoc. C-63; Doc. C-40; Doc. R-33; Doc. C-41; Doc. C-42; Doc. R-36.\n\nDoc. C-44.\n\nDoc. C-45; Doc. R-38.\n\nDoc. C-66.\n\n212.\n\nSubsequently, on 18 February 2014, the Mozambican law firm Sal & Caldeira Advogados, Lda. sent a letter to the MTC on behalf of PEL, in which it claimed compensation up to USD 4 million in connection with the results of the tender103.\n\nDoc. C-46, R-40.\n\n**8. The TML Project**\n----------------------\n\n213.\n\nHaving been adjudicated winner of the tender on 27 August 2013104, ITD created a project company [\"**TML**\"] to develop its own version of the Project [the \"**TML Project**\"]. TML is comprised of105:\n\n- ITD, with a 60% interest;\n\n- The Zambezia Development Corridor, with a 20% interest; and\n\n- The CFM, with a 20% interest.\n\nDoc. C-44.\n\nDoc. C-126.\n\n214.\n\nThroughout the fourth quarter of 2013, TML and the MTC negotiated the terms of a concession agreement, that was finally signed in December 2013 [the \"**TML Concession**\"]106. The TML Concession has a term of 30 years, with an option to extend it for an additional 10 years107.\n\nDoc. C-125, p. 145; Doc. C-126. *See* also Doc. R-42, p. 30.\n\nDoc. C-125, p. 145 ; Doc. R-42, p. 30.\n\n215.\n\nIn September 2015 TML completed its own pre-feasibility study for the TML Project108, and nearly two years later, in July 2017, it finalized its feasibility study109.\n\nDoc. R-42, pp. 20 *et seq*.\n\nDoc. R-42; Doc. C-125, p. 145.\n\n216.\n\nThe last information on the record is that in 2018 TML was trying to secure funding from Chinese lenders110. But the reality is that to this day no rail corridor has been built linking Moatize to Macuse. The Project has never been implemented, and in view of the diminishing importance of coal in the international energy market, there are little prospects that it will ever be built.\n\nDoc. C-130.\n\n**9. Arbitration proceedings**\n------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nClaimant's attempts to resolve the dispute with Mozambique amicably between 2013 and 2015 were unsuccessful111. On 25 June 2018 PEL notified Mozambique of the existence of an investment dispute under the Treaty, but informed that it remained open to settle the dispute amicably112.\n\nDoc. C-49, para. 47. *See* also Terms of Appointment, para. 52.\n\nDoc. C-49.\n\n218.\n\nThe Parties engaged in settlement negotiations, to no avail113. Therefore, on 20 March 2020 PEL filed a Notice of Arbitration against the Republic, claiming that Mozambique's conduct towards Claimant and its investment contravened Respondent's obligations under the BIT and under customary international law, and seeking declaratory relief, damages and compensation114.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 102-103.\n\nNotice of Arbitration; Terms of Appointment, paras. 53-54.\n\nThe ICC Arbitration\n-------------------\n\n219.\n\nTwo months later, on 20 May 2020, Mozambique (together with the MTC) filed a Request for Arbitration with the ICC Court against PEL under the arbitration agreement contained in Clause 10 of the MOI115, thus giving rise to the ICC Arbitration116.\n\nClause 10 provides for ICC Arbitration with a seat in the Republic of Mozambique (Doc. C-5A; Doc. R-2).\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 57.\n\n220.\n\nAlthough this Tribunal, once constituted, encouraged the Parties to consolidate the UNCITRAL arbitration and the ICC Arbitration under a single proceeding, the Parties were not able to agree on such consolidation \u2013 the stumbling block being that Mozambique did not agree to seat the arbitration in a neutral jurisdiction117.\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, para. 48.\n\n221.\n\nThe result was that both the UNCITRAL and the ICC Arbitrations proceeded in parallel. As explained in more detail in section II *supra*, Mozambique filed three Applications for the stay of the present proceedings, until the ICC Tribunal could determine the existence, validity, and scope of the Parties' contractual rights under the MOI \u2013 which this Tribunal rejected. Mozambique also requested and obtained the ICC Injunction, issued by the ICC Tribunal, with the purpose of derailing the present procedure.\n\n**IV. RELIEF SOUGHT**\n---------------------\n\n**1. Claimant's relief sought**\n-------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nPEL asked for the following relief in its Statement of Claim118:\n\n\"482 PEL reserves its right to introduce, *inter alia*, further claims, arguments, evidence, fact witnesses, experts and damages valuations.\n\n483 For the reasons set out in PEL's Statement of Claim, PEL requests that the Tribunal:\n\na. FIND that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over PEL's claims;\n\nb. FIND that Respondent has breached its obligations towards PEL under the Treaty;\n\nc. ORDER Respondent to compensate PEL for the loss of its investment arising from Respondent's violations of the Treaty, with such reparation being in the form of monetary compensation in an amount to be determined by the Tribunal, but in any event, no less than USD 115.3 million;\n\nd. ORDER Respondent to pay all costs incurred by PEL in connection with these arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and the Permanent Court of Arbitration, as well as all legal costs and other expenses incurred by PEL (including, *inter alia*, the fees of their legal counsel, experts, and consultants, and fees associated with third party funding);\n\ne. ORDER Respondent to pay interest at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal on any compensation and/or arbitration and/or legal costs and expenses awarded to PEL by the Tribunal in its Final Award or any other award issued in the course of this arbitration; and\n\nf. ORDER such further or alternative relief as the Tribunal shall consider just or appropriate.\"\n\nC I, paras. 482-483.\n\n223.\n\nClaimant requested the following relief in its Reply119:\n\n\"1152 For the reasons set out above, PEL requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DECLARE that it has jurisdiction over all the claims presented by Claimant in this Arbitration;\n\n(b) DECLARE that all the claims presented by Claimant in this Arbitration are admissible;\n\n(c) DECLARE that Respondent has breached Article 3(2) and/or Article 5 of the Treaty and/or Article 3(4) of the Mozambique/Netherlands BIT;\n\n(d) ORDER that Respondent pay compensation to Claimant in the sum of ***USD 156 million***, or such amount that is just;\n\n(e) ORDER that Respondent pay all the costs incurred by Claimant in connection with this Arbitration proceeding, including the costs of the arbitrators and of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, legal costs and other expenses (including but not limited to those of counsel, experts, consultants, and fees associated with third party funding);\n\n(f) ORDER that Respondent pay pre- and post- award interest at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal on any compensation and/or arbitration costs ex and/or legal costs awarded to Claimant; and\n\n(g) ORDER such further relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.\"\n\nC II, para. 1152.\n\n224.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction and in its Post-Hearing Brief, PEL reiterated the requests set forth in its Reply120.\n\nC III, para. 527; CPHB, para. 77.\n\n**2. Respondent's request for relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nRespondent requested the following relief in its Statement of Defense121:\n\n\"940. Based on the foregoing, Respondent is entitled to and seeks an Award, as follows:\n\n940.1 Dismissing PEL's claims as inadmissible or, alternatively, declining jurisdiction;\n\n940.2 Sustaining Respondent's objections to jurisdiction;\n\n940.3 In the alternative, dismissing Claimant's case on the merits;\n\n940.4 Awarding Claimant no damages;\n\n940.5 Ordering that PEL and its litigation funder pay Respondent's attorneys' fees and all costs and expenses; and\n\n940.6 Granting Respondent such further or other relief as the Tribunal shall deem to be just and appropriate.\"\n\nR I, para. 940.\n\n226.\n\nIn its Rejoinder and in its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent reiterated the requests set forth in its Statement of Defense122.\n\nR II, para. 1601; RPHB, p. 21.\n\n**V. DISCUSSION**\n-----------------\n\n227.\n\nIn this arbitration PEL submits that the Republic breached the BIT by failing to award PEL the concession contract to build the Project. Claimant says that it entered into the MOI with the Government of Mozambique with the purpose of conducting the Pre-Feasibility Study and developing the concept of the Project; and in exchange, the Government agreed to grant the concession for the Project directly to PEL. Claimant asserts it spent millions of USD preparing the Pre-Feasibility Study that proved that the Project was viable and established the technical and economic terms for obtaining the concession123.\n\n*See* Notice of Arbitration, paras. 18-19; Terms of Appointment, paras. 42-44.\n\n228.\n\nHowever, after the Government approved the Pre-Feasibility Study, Mozambique took Claimant \"on a roller-coaster of contradictory and unlawful decisions\"124: promising first that it would abide by its commitment to grant the concession directly to PEL; but then organizing a public tender, in breach of Claimant's exclusive right to the concession contract; thereafter, the Council of Ministers offered again a direct award to PEL, only to reverse its decision a few weeks later on the basis of unfounded reasons.\n\nC II, para. 6.\n\n229.\n\nPEL seeks a compensation of USD 156 million, which allegedly equates to PEL's lost profits caused by Respondent's refusal to grant Claimant the concession contract.\n\n230.\n\nRespondent rejects any wrongdoing under international law and makes six jurisdictional objections125, the most relevant of which is that Claimant held no protected \"investment\" under the BIT126. Claimant was not awarded a concession contract, and thus, it did not design, finance, build or maintain any infrastructure in Mozambique.\n\nRespondent's six jurisdictional objections are that: (i) Claimant made no \"investment\" under the BIT; (ii) this is a contractual dispute; (iii) Claimant is not an investor under the BIT; (iv) the BIT was denounced and that it is not enforceable in the present case; (v) Claimant failed to exhaust local remedies; and (vi) PEL's claims are barred due to its fraudulent and illegal conduct.\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 59.\n\n231.\n\nThe Republic adds that PEL is making a speculative claim, on the basis of a preliminary agreement that solely governed the preparation of a Pre-Feasibility Study. The Republic never guaranteed that it would award PEL the concession contract. At best, Claimant had an option to negotiate the adjudication of the concession or enjoy a scoring advantage in a public tender. Respondent says that the Tribunal should not permit Claimant's attempt to extend the protection of the BIT to the pre-award and pre-concession activities that PEL conducted in Mozambique. To rule otherwise would create new international standards for procurement disputes that would allow any unsuccessful bidder to claim disproportionate amounts of damages when a project is awarded to another contractor.\n\n232.\n\nUltimately, Respondent argues, this is not the appropriate forum to adjudicate what is, in essence, a contractual dispute about the execution, alleged validity, alleged terms, interpretation and alleged breaches of the MOI127.\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 60.\n\n233.\n\nAt the outset of this case the Tribunal dismissed Respondent's Motion for Bifurcation, on the basis that Mozambique's main objection, on the existence of a protected investment, was an issue inextricably intertwined with the merits. The Tribunal found that to properly adjudicate this objection, the Tribunal could not simply rely on the facts as pleaded by PEL but would have to review and analyze a significant amount of evidence to make its own findings. Therefore, the Tribunal saw no gains in bifurcating this objection from the merits128.\n\nProcedural Order No. 3, para. 65.\n\n234.\n\nAfter a full briefing of this case, the Tribunal is now in a position to render its decision: the Tribunal will address the *ratione materiae* objection first and will conclude that Claimant did not have a protected investment under the BIT; and thus, it has no standing to bring this claim.\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal clarifies that it could not have been able to render this decision without hearing the Parties' full case. As anticipated in the decision on bifurcation, the determination of the *ratione materiae* objection is inextricably intertwined with the merits and required the Tribunal to evaluate all the evidence brought before it.\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal's findings with respect to Mozambique's *ratione materiae* objection render the remainder of the Parties' submissions on jurisdiction, liability and quantum, moot and, as a result, the Tribunal will not address them.\n\n237.\n\nIn the following sections, the Tribunal will set out the legal rules relevant to its decision (**1.**), summarize the Parties' positions with respect to the objection (**2.**), and will then adopt a decision concluding that Claimant's activities in Mozambique are not covered under the scope of the BIT and that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the case (**3.**).\n\n**1. The relevant legal rules**\n-------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThis Tribunal has been constituted under the UNCITRAL Rules, pursuant to Art. 9 of the BIT and as agreed by the Parties as set out in the Terms of Appointment129.\n\n*See* Terms of Appointment, para. 69.\n\n239.\n\nArt. 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules defines the Tribunal's authority to decide on its own jurisdiction:\n\n\"The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on objections that it has no jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration clause or of the separate arbitration agreement.\"\n\n240.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal has the power to decide on its own jurisdiction.\n\n241.\n\nAs regards the applicable rules of law, Art. 33 of the UNCITRAL Rules states that:\n\n\"The arbitral tribunal shall apply the law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute. Failing such designation by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall apply the law determined by the conflict of laws rules which it considers applicable.\"\n\n242.\n\nIn this case, in accordance with Art. 9(3)(c)(iii) of the Treaty130:\n\n\"The arbitral award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement [\u2026].\"\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\n243.\n\nThe adjudication of the jurisdictional objection requires the interpretation of the BIT, and both Parties have referred to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties [\"**VCLT**\"] and specifically to its Art. 31, which has been accepted as a codification of customary international law and which reads as follows131:\n\n\"Article 31 \u2013 General rule of interpretation\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty; (b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions; (b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation; (c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\"\n\nDoc. CLA-5.\n\n244.\n\nThe Parties have also made reference to numerous arbitral awards. These decisions do not constitute a formal source of international law, do not have a binding character and are mere \"sources of inspiration, comfort or reference to arbitrators\"132. That said, the Tribunal finds value in following convincing and consistent case law.\n\nDoc. RLA-61, *Romak*, para. 170. *See* also Doc. RLA-105, *Bayindir*, para. 76.\n\n**2. The Parties' positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n**2.1 Claimant's position**\n---------------------------\n\n245.\n\nClaimant says that it held a protected investment in the form of133:\n\n- The right to a direct award of the concession to implement the Project, by virtue of the MOI, the Government's decision to approve the Pre-Feasibility Study and the April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision; and, as an ancillary right, it had the first right of refusal, that consisted in Claimant's prerogative to accept developing the Project and sign the concession agreement \u2013 or refuse to do so, in which case the Government could offer the Project to third parties;\n\n- The valuable know-how transferred to the State with PEL's Project concept, contained in the Preliminary Study and the Pre-Feasibility Study.\n\nC I, paras. 95-96, 257; C II, paras. 163, 510; C III, para. 218; CPHB, para. 7.\n\n246.\n\nPEL says that its investment falls within the broad chapeau of Art. 1(b) of the BIT that protects \"every kind of asset established or acquired, including changes in the form of such investment in accordance with the national laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made\", and in particular, within the non-exhaustive list of assets, that include134:\n\n- \"business concessions conferred by law or under contract\" (Art.1(b)(v));\n\n- \"rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\" (Art. 1(b)(iii)); and\n\n- \"intellectual property rights, in accordance with the relevant laws of the respective Contracting Party\" (Art. 1(b)(iv)).\n\nC II, para. 513; C III, para. 222.\n\n247.\n\nClaimant says that the Republic mischaracterizes PEL's investment as \"contingent\" rights or an \"option\"; but this is a flawed argument. The MOI is a binding contract, which includes certain rights and obligations \u2013 such as the right to the direct award of a concession, subject to the approval of the Pre-Feasibility Study and PEL exercising its right of first refusal135. Additionally, as a logical flipside to its commitment to award the concession, Mozambique136:\n\n- Granted PEL exclusivity rights in relation to the Project;\n\n- Committed not to grant rights in that respect to any other party; and\n\n- Committed to keep the information shared in relation to the Project confidential.\n\nC II, para. 599; C III, paras. 246, 199, *et seq*.; CPHB, paras. 31, 41-42.\n\nC III, para. 247.\n\n248.\n\nPEL says that it is undisputed that on 12 June 2012 Mozambique approved the Pre-Feasibility Study and some days later, on 18 June 2012, PEL exercised its right of first refusal, definitively acquiring its right to the concession137.\n\nC III, paras. 248-251; CPHB, para. 9.\n\n249.\n\nAdditionally, there was nothing \"contingent\" about the April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision, which expressly granted a direct award to PEL138.\n\nCPHB, para. 9.\n\n250.\n\nClaimant submits that, while it is true that PEL did not physically sign a concession agreement (due to Respondent's breach of the BIT), Claimant did \"establish\" or \"acquire\" an immediate and direct right to a concession, that became vested in PEL once Mozambique approved the Pre-Feasibility Study and PEL exercised its right to the direct award of the Project concession139.\n\nC II, paras. 517-518; C III, para. 244.\n\n251.\n\nClaimant says that there was nothing \"contingent\" about PEL's vested right to be awarded the concession140.\n\nC II, para. 521.\n\n252.\n\nBut even if the Tribunal were to consider that Claimant's right to the concession was \"contingent\" \u2013 because it did not sign a concession agreement \u2013 and that contingent assets fall outside the scope of the BIT141, Claimant submits that the Tribunal should view the totality of Claimant's activities holistically as a unitary investment. In other words, the Tribunal should avoid \"surgically separat[ing]\" the protected assets under the BIT (such as Claimant's rights under the MOI, know-how, the Pre-Feasibility Study and Preliminary Study) from non-covered assets (the contingent concession) and regard the investment operation as a whole. This is particularly required in this case because Respondent's failure to sign the concession is the root of Respondent's objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and also constitutes the core aspect of its delict under the BIT142.\n\nC II, para. 532.\n\nC II, para. 533.\n\nThe position of Claimant's expert regarding the rights conferred by the MOI\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nPEL has submitted two legal opinions of Prof. Rui Medeiros regarding the rights conferred by the MOI.\n\n254.\n\nProf. Medeiros concludes \u2013 based on Claimant's English MOI and the conduct of the Parties \u2013 that the MOI grants a \"right of preference\" that should be interpreted as PEL's right to a direct award of the concession, once the Pre-Feasibility Study is approved, and143:\n\n- The \"*direito de prefer\u00eancia*\" as understood under Mozambican law does not require the existence of third-party bids, and therefore, cannot mean a quantitative advantage in a tender process; and\n\n- The behavior of the Parties after the execution of the MOI confirms that they understood that the MOI granted PEL the right to a direct award.\n\nCER-6, Medeiros II, paras. A-D.\n\n**2.2 Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n255.\n\nThe Republic says that the definition of investment in Art. 1(b) of the BIT provides that \"the term 'investment' means every kind of asset established or acquired [\u2026]\". Thus, the Contracting States established the limitation that, for particular assets to qualify as protected investments, they had to be \"established\" or \"acquired\" as opposed to contingent or optional rights, that fall within the category of non-covered pre-investment activities144.\n\nR I, para. 367.\n\n256.\n\nThis limitation is particularly relevant in the present case because the potential investment under discussion was a concession contract that never came to fruition; and the requirement that the investment be \"established\" or \"acquired\" is reinforced in the case of concession agreements, as per Art. 1(b)(v) of the BIT, which only protects \"business concessions *conferred* by law or under contract\"145.\n\nR I, paras. 368-369.\n\n257.\n\nIn the Republic's view, the MOI is a preliminary and contingent contract that sets forth the requirements or conditions under which PEL and Mozambique may enter into a PPP in the form of a concession contract146.\n\nRPHB, pp. 2 and 5-7. *See* also R I, paras. 385-387; R II, para. 661.\n\n258.\n\nRespondent says that, when the MTC approved the Pre-Feasibility Study on 12 June 2012, it provided Claimant with two options147:\n\n- To exercise its \"*direito de prefer\u00eancia*\" consisting of a 15% margin in a public tender; and/or\n\n- To negotiate with CFM the creation of a joint venture, which could potentially have been awarded the concession by \"*ajuste directo*\".\n\nRPHB, p. 8, citing to Doc. C-11.\n\n259.\n\nPEL opted to pursue both options148:\n\nRPHB, pp. 8-9.\n\n260.\n\nFirst, it sought negotiations with the CFM, but failed to reach an agreement. Respondent says that it was only if PEL and the CFM had reached an agreement, then the joint venture of PEL and CFM would have been granted the concession by \"*ajuste directo*\" (but the concession would have never been awarded through \"*ajuste directo*\" solely to PEL, without the CFM).\n\n261.\n\nSecond, after the failed negotiation, the MTC proceeded with the tender process, pursuant to the PPP Law. PEL participated in the public tender and exercised its \"*direito de prefer\u00eancia*\" margin of 15%. However, an independent jury (not the MTC) scored PEL's bid in last place, and the Government awarded the concession to the bidder with the highest score149.\n\nRPHB, p. 9.\n\n262.\n\nBefore the public tender was finalized, on 18 April 2013, the Government went even further and granted PEL another chance to enter into an agreement with the CFM, in order to obtain the concession through \"*ajuste directo*\", subject to two conditions150:\n\n- That PEL provide a bank guarantee; and\n\n- That PEL sign a written letter, agreement or take-or-pay memorandum with mining company off-takers.\n\nRPHB, p. 10; Doc. C-29.\n\n263.\n\nClaimant failed to comply with the second requirement and, therefore, no further negotiations ensued151.\n\nRPHB, p. 10.\n\n264.\n\nIn light of the above, Respondent sustains that Claimant had at best a contingent contract152, an option153, or a \"mere agreement to agree\"154 and that the conditions to award the concession were never met. This is why Mozambique never awarded PEL the concession contract. Therefore, Claimant never \"established\" or \"acquired\" a concession \"conferred by law or under contract\"155.\n\nR II, paras. 661-679; RPHB, pp. 2, 5-7.\n\nR I, para. 362. *See* also Terms of Appointment, para. 59.\n\nR I, para. 362.\n\nR I, paras. 373-375.\n\n265.\n\nAll expenditures and efforts by PEL in connection to the MOI are not an investment \u2013 they are instead pre-investment activities that, at best, may give rise to a contractual dispute156.\n\nR I, paras. 388, 391.\n\nThe position of Respondent's expert regarding the rights afforded by the MOI\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nThe Republic submitted two legal opinions of Ms. Teresa F. Muenda, who expressed her views on the nature of the rights conferred by the MOI \u2013 an agreement which, in the expert's opinion, is governed by and must be interpreted in accordance with Mozambican law157.\n\nRER-2, Muenda I, p. 2, paras. 1-2.\n\n267.\n\nMs. Muenda agrees with Respondent that the MOI does not constitute a direct and definitive award of the concession contract; but rather a contingent contract that establishes a \"*direito de prefer\u00eancia*\"158.\n\nRER-2, Muenda I, p. 6, para. 11(e); RER-7, Muenda II, p. 2.\n\n268.\n\nMs. Muenda offered two alternative interpretations of what constitutes such \"*direito de prefer\u00eancia*\"159:\n\n- In 2011, when the Parties entered into the MOI, the PPP Law was not in force; the only reference in the Mozambican legal regime to a \"*direito de prefer\u00eancia*\" was the one in Art. 414 of the Civil Code; therefore, in that context, PEL's right consisted in a \"*direito potestativo de, aceitando o cumprimento dos elementos da oferta vencedora, celebrar o contrato na posi\u00e7\u00e3o de concession\u00e1ria*\";\n\n- Once the PPP Law came into effect in 2012, PEL's right under the MOI \"transformed\" into a \"*direito e margem de 15%*\".\n\nHT, Day 8, pp. 1734-1736, 1785 (Muenda).\n\n**3. The Tribunal's decision**\n------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nThere is no dispute regarding the fact that Mozambique never awarded PEL a concession to develop the Project. What the Parties discuss is whether Claimant's rights enshrined in the MOI, together with its expenditures and activities (prior to Mozambique's decision to award a concession to ITD/TML, and not to Claimant) are covered investments under the BIT.\n\n270.\n\nEssentially, PEL avers that it held the following \"assets\" that are protected under the BIT:\n\n- Under the MOI and pursuant to the Government's decision to approve the Pre-Feasibility Study, Claimant had the right to obtain a direct award of the concession contract to implement the Project; Claimant's right to a direct award is confirmed by the April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision; and, as an ancillary right, Claimant had a first right of refusal under the MOI, that consisted in Claimant's prerogative to accept developing the Project and to sign the concession agreement, or to refuse, in which case the Government could offer the Project to third parties; and\n\n- The valuable know-how transferred to the State with its Project concept, contained in the Preliminary Study and the Pre-Feasibility Study.\n\n271.\n\nMozambique views the situation differently: it says that the MOI was a preliminary and contingent contract that set forth the requirements or conditions under which PEL and Mozambique could enter into a PPP in the form of a concession contract. PEL undertook to carry out the Pre-Feasibility Study at its own costs, and in exchange Mozambique agreed to grant Claimant a \"*direito de prefer\u00eancia*\", which constituted either of:\n\n- A right to engage in direct negotiations with CFM, in order to constitute a joint venture that could eventually be awarded a concession contract; or\n\n- A 15% scoring advantage in a public tender.\n\n272.\n\nThe Republic says that Claimant failed to reach an agreement with CFM. Then, the Government put in place a public tender, in which Claimant enjoyed a 15% scoring advantage; but eventually, an independent jury scored PEL's bid in last place, and the Government awarded the concession to the bidder with the highest score. In these circumstances, PEL failed to make an investment in Mozambique.\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal is called upon to establish the proper meaning of the term \"investment\" as used in the BIT and to decide whether Claimant's activities and rights qualify as such. To perform this task the Tribunal will:\n\n- Establish the definition of investment in the BIT (**3.1**);\n\n- Analyze whether the BIT presupposes an objective and inherent concept of investment and conclude that it does (**3.2**);\n\n- Explore the boundaries of the objective and inherent concept of investment (**3.3**); and\n\n- Apply its findings to the facts of the present case (**3.4**).\n\n274.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal will make some final considerations regarding the case (**3.5**).\n\n**3.1 The definition of investment in the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe definition of investment is contained in Art. 1(b) of the BIT160:\n\n**\"Article 1**\n\n**Definitions**\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n[\u2026] (b) The term \"investment\" means every kind of asset established or acquired, including changes in the form of such investment in accordance with the national laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\n(i) movable and immovable property as well as others rights such as mortgages, liens or pledges;\n\n(ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other similar forms of participation in a company;\n\n(iii) rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value;\n\n(iv) intellectual property rights, in accordance with the relevant laws of the respective Contracting Party;\n\n(v) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for and extract oil and other minerals. [\u2026]\"\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\n276.\n\nBut this is not the only relevant provision. Art. 1(e) of the BIT defines a fundamental element of an investment, the capacity to generate a return161:\n\n\"(e) The term \"returns\" means the monetary amounts yielded by an investment such as profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and fees.\"\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\n277.\n\nArt. 7(1) of the BIT then provides rules regarding the \"[t]ransfer of Investments and Returns\"162:\n\n\"(1) Each Contracting Party shall permit all funds of an investor of the other Contracting Party related to an investment in its territory to be freely transferred, without unreasonable delay and on a non-discriminatory basis. Such funds may include:\n\n(a) Capital and additional capital amounts used to maintain and increase investments;\n\n(b) Net operating profits including dividends and interest in proportion to their share-holdings;\n\n(c) Repayments of any loan including interest thereon, relating to the investment;\n\n(d) Payment of royalties and services fees relating to the investment;\n\n(e) Proceeds from sales of their shares;\n\n(f) Proceeds received by investors in case of sale or partial sale or liquidation;\n\n(g) The earnings of citizens/nationals of one Contracting Party who work in connection with investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\n**3.2 Is there an inherent meaning of investment?**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nRespondent suggests that the concept of investment has a deeper meaning which transcends the mere definition contained in the BIT: to determine whether an \"asset\" falls within the protection of the BIT the Tribunal must examine whether it has the inherent characteristics of an investment. In order to do so, Mozambique proposes that the Tribunal apply the so-called *Salini* test163.\n\nR I, paras. 400-401.\n\n279.\n\nPEL, on the other hand, suggests that the Tribunal should adhere to a literal interpretation of the BIT, and refrain from applying the *Salini* test to derive the inherent characteristics of an investment. Such approach is only applicable in the ICSID context, and is, thus, not relevant in this case164.\n\nC II, paras. 574-576.\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that there must be an inherent meaning of investment, which underlies the definition of \"investment\" as set-forth in the BIT; and does not share Claimant's suggestion that the meaning of investment is contingent on the applicable forum or arbitration rules. That said, the Tribunal is also skeptical of the utility of applying the *Salini* test to assess whether a particular asset possesses the inherent characteristics of an investment165.\n\n*See* para. 306 *infra*.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal's position is supported by the following arguments:\n\n**a. Irrelevance of the forum**\n-------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal recalls that under Art. 9 of the BIT the investor enjoys the option to have any investment dispute adjudicated by arbitration under the ICSID Convention (if the Contracting Parties are both parties to the ICSID Convention), under the ICSID Additional Facility (if the disputing parties agree), or alternatively, pursuant to the UNCITRAL Rules166. The claimant thus has the option to select whether it prefers to pursue an institutional or *ad hoc* arbitration to adjudicate the dispute with the host State.\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\n283.\n\nDoes this choice have any influence on the concept of protected investment?\n\n284.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, the term \"investment\" in Art. 1(b) of the BIT cannot have different meanings depending on the forum where the dispute is to be adjudicated167. It must have a unique meaning, irrespective of the forum and the arbitration rules that the claimant elects. To understand otherwise would lead to the untenable result that a procedural feature, freely chosen by the investor, impacts on the tribunal's jurisdiction and on the material scope of protection.\n\nDoc. RLA-61, *Romak*, paras. 194, 207; Doc. RLA-58, *Nova Scotia*, para. 80.\n\n**b. Interpretation under Art. 31 of the VCLT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nSecond, an interpretation of the BIT, in accordance with Art. 31 of the VCLT, supports the conclusion that not every legal relationship involving the investor can be labelled as investment; rather, there must be an inherent meaning of investment, with a set of features, which such legal relationship must meet to deserve protection under the BIT.\n\n286.\n\nPursuant to Art. 31 of the VCLT168:\n\n\"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\nDoc. CLA-5.\n\n287.\n\nThe starting point is thus the ordinary meaning of the terms contained in Art. 1(b) of the BIT. This provision offers a succinct definition, stating that investment169:\n\n\"[\u2026] means every kind of asset established or acquired, including changes in the form of such investment in accordance with the national laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made.\"\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\n288.\n\nThe Treaty defines \"investment\" as an \"asset\" \u2013 a very wide concept which encompasses items with a certain value, which, if held by a merchant, can be represented as a credit in the merchant's balance sheet170.\n\n*See* the definition of \"asset\" in *Black's Law Dictionary*: \"1. An item that is owned and has value. 2. (*pl*.) The entries on a balance sheet showing the items of property owned, including cash, inventory, equipment, real estate, accounts receivable, and goodwill. 3. (*pl*.) All the property of a person (esp. a bankrupt or deceased person) available for paying debts or for distribution.\" (Garner, B. A., & Black, H. C., *Black's Law Dictionary*, 9th ed. St. Paul (2009), p. 134).\n\n289.\n\nAfter this simple definition, the Treaty adds an open list of five categories of assets, which \"in particular, though not exclusively\" constitute investments171:\n\n- Categories (i) and (iv) refer to certain rights *in rem* (e.g., ownership, mortgages, liens or pledges) over movable or immovable property, including intellectual property rights;\n\n- Category (ii) concerns certain type of securities, in the form of \"shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other similar forms of participation in a company\"; this includes the paradigmatic form of equity investment, where an investor creates or acquires a lasting interest, normally associated to control, in an enterprise located in the host State;\n\n- Category (iii) refers to \"rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\"; and\n\n- Category (v) mentions \"business concessions\" conferred pursuant to domestic law, in particular, those related to the \"search for and extract[ion of] oil and other minerals\".\n\nDoc. CLA-1, Art. 1(b).\n\n290.\n\nSince the list in Art. 1(b) is non-exhaustive, there must be assets, not mentioned in that list, which also qualify as investments \u2013 the reason being that they meet the requirements inherent in the concept of investment. The paradigmatic example is the creation by a protected investor of a branch or permanent establishment in the host State, which carries out entrepreneurial activity.\n\n291.\n\nThe reverse also holds true: an asset, by the mere fact that it is mentioned in any of the categories listed in Art. 1(b), does not automatically become a protected investment; for this to happen it is again necessary that the inherent features of an investment are met.\n\n292.\n\nThis argument can best be proven by a *reductio ad absurdum*172: assume a citizen of one Contracting Party who is entitled to collect a pension from the other Contracting Party to the Treaty. Such citizen does indeed hold \"rights to money\" in the territory of the other State. Even though \"rights to money\" is mentioned in category (iii) of the non-exhaustive list of forms of investments, the right to collect a pension cannot be deemed an investment protected under the BIT, the main reason for this being that the object and purpose of the Treaty is to foster \"greater investments by investors of one State in the territory of the other State\"173 (as stated in its preamble) \u2013 not to protect the collection of pension rights.\n\n*See OI*, Award, para. 218.\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\n**c. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n293.\n\nSumming up, the fact that an asset is not mentioned in the non-exhaustive list of Art. 1(b) does not affect the fact that it may be an investment. Conversely, the mere fact that an asset falls within one of the categories included in the non-exhaustive list of Art. 1(b) does not necessarily imply that it can be considered as a protected investment. An additional requirement must be met: the asset must indeed qualify as an investment, by meeting the objective and inherent features which are shared by all investments174.\n\nDoc. RLA-61, *Romak*, para. 180; Doc. CLA-280, *Quiborax*, para. 214*. See* also *KT Asia*, Award, para. 165; *Global Trading*, Award, para. 43; see also *OI*, Award, para. 218.\n\n294.\n\nA note of caution: this conclusion does not mean that the contracting parties to a BIT do not have the possibility to clarify whether specific categories of assets are or not protected under that specific treaty. This is especially relevant in the case of loans and bonds: contracting parties can exclude certain classes of loans (*e.g.*, short term loans) and include others (*e.g.*, sovereign debt)175. But the fact that the contracting parties to an investment treaty enjoy certain flexibility in defining the scope of protection, does not detract from the notion that there are common features that define an investment, and that all protected investments must meet these features.\n\nSee also *Gramercy*, Award, paras. 205-215, which makes reference to the Peru-United States Free Trade Agreement, Annex 10-F entitled \"Public Debt\".\n\n295.\n\nIn the next section (**3.3**), the Tribunal will further develop the requirements which cause an asset to qualify as a protected investment.\n\n**d. Case law**\n---------------\n\n296.\n\nCase law supports this conclusion.\n\n297.\n\nThe tribunal in *Nova Scotia* noted that176:\n\n\"No matter what the forum, the ordinary meaning of investment in the relevant bilateral investment treaty derives from something more than a list of examples and calls for examination of the inherent features of an investment.\"\n\nDoc. RLA-58, *Nova Scotia*, para. 80.\n\n298.\n\nIn the *Romak* case, an arbitration conducted under the BIT between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Uzbekistan and pursuant to the UNCITRAL Rules, the tribunal was faced with the task of determining whether a wheat supply agreement constituted a protected investment. In its reasoning, the tribunal concluded that177:\n\n\"[\u2026] the term 'investments' under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk. The Arbitral Tribunal is further comforted in its analysis by the reasoning adopted by other arbitral tribunals [\u2026] which consistently incorporates contribution, duration and risk as hallmarks of an 'investment.' By their nature, asset types enumerated in the BIT's non-exhaustive list may exhibit these hallmarks. But if an asset does not correspond to the inherent definition of \"investment,\" the fact that it falls within one of the categories listed in Article 1 does not transform it into an 'investment.' In the general formulation of the tribunal in *Azinian,* '*labeling\u2026 is no substitute for analysis*'.\" [Emphasis in the original]\n\nDoc. RLA-61, *Romak*, para. 207 (footnotes omitted).\n\n**3.3 Determination of the inherent meaning of investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nWhat is then the inherent meaning of the term investment?\n\n300.\n\nThis issue is one of the *quaestiones vexatae* of investment arbitration. And it is a question to which there is no clear answer, because the term \"investment\" is not, in its origin, a legal concept: it was imported from the economic and financial realms, in which it refers to the economic process of conversion of money into productive property, in the expectation of a return. The process which economists label \"investment\" encompasses a wide variety of activities in which the investor contributes capital (and sometimes also know-how and other intangibles), hoping to earn a future return over a certain period. For economists the investment can result from an investor:\n\n- Exploiting an enterprise,\n\n- Exploiting real estate,\n\n- Owning a portfolio of shares or bonds,\n\n- Holding certain types of loans, or\n\n- Operating a concession or other long-term contract in the host State.\n\n301.\n\nLegally speaking, investments are formalized (*inter alia*) by the creation of a branch, by the incorporation of or capital increase in a local company, by the acquisition of ownership or other rights *in rem* over property, by the subscription of shares or debentures or by the execution of various types of contracts.\n\n302.\n\nThe purpose of investment treaties is to foster foreign investment. An expansive approach to the concept of investment permits that a wider range of activities enjoy protection (if invested by a protected investor and assuming that the territoriality requirements are met). But this expansive approach provokes a conceptual difficulty: there is no single legal concept (be it ownership, contract, corporation, branch, *etc.*) capable of encompassing these assorted legal relationships. Thus, treaties often opt for an open definition plus a non-exhaustive list of examples \u2013 an approach which may simplify drafting, but which creates a grey area of situations, in which tribunals must decide, with little guidance from the treaty wording, whether an asset qualifies or not as an investment.\n\nThe *Salini* test\n-----------------\n\n303.\n\nTo solve these difficulties, tribunals have developed lists of traits, which help them decide whether assets constitute protected investments. The best-known catalogue is the so-called *Salini* test, which refers to four characteristics178:\n\n- Contributions;\n\n- Duration of performance;\n\n- Risk of the transaction; and\n\n- Contribution to the economic development of the host State.\n\nNamed after the award in Doc. RLA-57, *Salini*, paras. 52-57, although used before that in Doc. CLA-307, *Fedax*, para. 43, to which the *Salini* decision alludes*.*\n\n304.\n\nThe *Salini* test arose in the context of an ICSID arbitration involving a construction contract, and the tribunal found that such contract indeed gave rise to a protected investment.\n\n305.\n\nTo be helpful, the application of any test should lead to analogous results, whatever the class of asset analyzed. But a blind application of the *Salini* test to different classes of assets seems to yield inconsistent results.\n\n306.\n\nIf the *Salini* test is chosen as yard stick for defining investments, no common profile seems to emerge that can be applied uniformly to all classes of assets. Equity investment, debentures, ownership of real estate, concession contracts, construction contracts \u2013 each category seems to have its own and unique profile of contribution, risk and duration, and thus the *Salini* features are of limited assistance in trying to establish an objective and inherent concept for all classes of investment.\n\n307.\n\nHow to solve the difficulty?\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal feels that the better approach in this case is to proceed in two steps: first to break up the analysis, taking as a starting point the classes of protected \"investments\", which can be deduced from the non-exhaustive list provided for in the BIT, and in a second step to seek common features within each category.\n\n309.\n\nIn the present case, there are two classes of alleged \"investments\" which are potentially relevant: equity investment in an enterprise (**A.**) and investment in the form of contracts (**B.**). The Tribunal will also consider a related category of legal relationships, so-called \"pre-investment activities\", which are especially relevant in the present case (**C**.).\n\n**A. Investment in an enterprise**\n----------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nInvestment in the equity of an enterprise implies the acquisition by a foreign investor of a lasting interest, frequently associated with control, in an enterprise located in the host State (an enterprise being an organization incorporating labor and capital and producing goods or services to be sold on the market). Equity investments are usually formalized by:\n\n- Creating a local branch or permanent establishment (a form not explicitly mentioned in the non-exhaustive list of Art. 1(b) of the BIT); or\n\n- Taking or acquiring a capital participation in a local corporation (*i*.*e*., Art. 1(b)(ii) of the BIT: \"shares in and stock [\u2026] of a company and any other similar forms of participation in a company\").\n\n311.\n\nThe acquisition of equity in an enterprise represents the paradigmatic form of investment, which treaties seek to foster and encourage; in general, this type of investments meets the inherent features of investment \u2013 normally, no further investigation (applying the *Salini* criteria or any other) would be necessary179.\n\nSee also *OI*, para. 224. Equity investments are routinely mentioned in the non-exhaustive lists of investments contained in bilateral investment treaties.\n\n**B. Investments in the form of contracts**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe situation is different in those cases where the alleged investment is formalized as a contract or as rights deriving from a contract (as opposed to an equity investment)180. Arts. 1(b)(iii) and (v) of the BIT include among the admitted forms of investment two contractual situations:\n\n- \"(iii) rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\"; and\n\n- \"(v) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for and extract[ion of] oil and other minerals\".\n\nCertain contractual investments \u2013 *e.g.*, concessions \u2013 can result in the investor creating an enterprise in the host State, and then section (A.) would also be relevant.\n\n**a. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n313.\n\nThe issue whether contracts qualify or not as investments has most frequently been discussed in the context of construction, services and concession agreements signed with the host State or with one of its agencies.\n\n314.\n\nOn certain occasions, tribunals have found (frequently by applying the *Salini* test) that medium or long-term construction contracts181, service contracts182 or concession contracts183 constitute protected investments. In most of these cases, the investor, in complying with the contract, performed an entrepreneurial activity in the host State (often by incorporating a branch or a subsidiary), hiring local staff and contributing its own capital, assets and know-how.\n\nDoc. RLA-57, *Salini*; Doc. CLA-146, *White Industries*.\n\n*See* Doc. CLA-289, referring to *SGS*; *see* also *MHS*.\n\n*See* also *Flughafen*.\n\n315.\n\nBut this is not always the case. On certain occasions tribunals have held that contracts performed in the host country do not give rise to protected investments184. And rightly so: the mere fact that contractual rights are included in the non-exhaustive list of assets in Art. 1(b) of the BIT does not necessarily imply that the rights deriving from each and all contracts are protected investments.\n\nDoc. RLA-53, *Joy Mining*, which held that a contract involving two phases (one concerned with the replacement of equipment in a mining project located in Egypt's Western Desert, and the second entailing the engineering, design and supply of a new longwall system) was not an investment*.*\n\n316.\n\nTo give an example of special relevance in the present case: Art. 1(b)(iii) includes in the list of assets which can constitute investments \"rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\". But this inclusion does not imply that every contract where the performance by one party has a financial value (*e.g.*, the contract for the sale of a tractor) constitutes an investment. The Tribunal has already found that the rights in question must have the inherent features shared by all investments185.\n\n*See* para. 293 *supra*.\n\n**b. The inherent features of investments**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, the common features of investments can be discerned from a careful review of the wording of the BIT:\n\n- Under Art. 1(b) of the BIT, investments must be \"assets\" \u2013 in accordance with its ordinary meaning, an item which is owned and has value186;\n\n- Art. 1(e) foresees that investments made by an investor are expected to produce \"returns\", normally in the form of \"profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and fees\"; and\n\n- Furthermore, Art. 7(1)(a) refers to \"[c]apital and additional capital amounts used to maintain and increase investments\", and includes contributions transferred by the investor into the host State to establish, maintain or increase an investment.\n\nGarner, B. A., & Black, H. C., *Black's Law Dictionary*, 9th ed. St. Paul (2009), p. 902.\n\n318.\n\nThe common features of an investment are thus:\n\n- A contribution of capital or equivalent value made by the investor;\n\n- The ownership of, or entitlement to, an asset with value, located in the host State, that results from such contribution;\n\n- An asset which is expected to produce a return, in the form of \"profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and fees\"; and\n\n- A certain duration.\n\n319.\n\nNormal commercial contracts, where money is paid as a simple *quid pro quo* against delivery of goods or services, do not meet these features; investments, however, involve a capital outlay for the establishment or acquisition of an asset, which is expected to generate returns in due course.\n\n320.\n\nLong-term construction contracts or concession contracts will normally meet these requirements: the investor contributes capital, machinery, intellectual property or other economic resources into the host State, in the expectation of a future profit which will accrue over time.\n\n**C. Pre-investment activities**\n--------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThere is an additional category of legal relationships that merit attention.\n\n322.\n\nAn investment frequently requires that a prospective investor perform certain pre-investment activities, *i*.*e*., that the investor accomplish certain tasks and incur certain costs in preparation of a (future) investment; these are typically activities and expenditures incurred in:\n\n- Negotiating the investment;\n\n- Securing financing;\n\n- Obtaining the necessary governmental authorizations or permits; or\n\n- Performing preparatory works, such as engineering or legal or environmental studies on the feasibility of a project.\n\n323.\n\nMost of these pre-investment activities are simply factual, and only require the participation of the investor (*e.g.*, the request of an administrative authorization).\n\n324.\n\nBut in other occasions these activities may take the legal form of a contract (*e.g.*, a memorandum of intent to acquire shares, or a contract with a local engineering firm to carry out a feasibility study). The question, again, is whether these contracts are protected under the BIT, simply because they fit within the terms of Art. 1(b)(iii): \"rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\".\n\n**a. General rule**\n-------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe answer is that pre-investment activities, even if formalized under certain contracts, are generally not protected as investments under international investment agreements. As Professor Schreuer notes187:\n\n\"Steps preparatory to an investment will not by themselves be accepted as an investment [\u2026].\"\n\nSchreuer, C. H., *et al*, *The ICSID Convention \u2013 A Commentary*, 2nd ed. (2009), p. 134, para. 175.\n\n326.\n\nThe reason is that as a rule pre-investment activities do not possess the features of an investment identified by the Tribunal: they do not entail a contribution, which results in the establishment or acquisition of an asset, which in turn is expected to produce a return for the benefit of the investor over an extended period of time.\n\n327.\n\nAs the term itself suggests, pre-investment activities are tasks performed or costs incurred by the investor, prior to and with the purpose of preparing an investment; their aim is to facilitate the subsequent capital contribution, which will set in motion the establishment or acquisition of the asset in the host State. The expected result of the pre-investment activity is not the direct obtention of \"returns\" (*i*.*e*., \"profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and fees\"), but rather the establishment or acquisition of an asset, and this asset in turn will set in motion the generation of \"returns\".\n\n328.\n\nDisputes can and do arise in the pre-investment phase: negotiations can be frustrated by improper State conduct, administrative authorizations can be denied for arbitrary or discretionary reasons, or the prospective investor can be unlawfully prevented from making an investment188. In these situations, however, the investment has not yet materialized, the protection of the BIT is not available, and the investor must resort to contractual or extracontractual remedies under municipal law.\n\nHeiskanen, V., \"Of capital import: the definition of 'investment' in international investment law\", in *Protection of Foreign Investments through Modern Treaty Arbitration \u2013 Diversity and Harmonization*, A. Hoffmann ed., ASA Special Series No. 34, May 2010.\n\nCase law\n--------\n\n329.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by investment case law.\n\n330.\n\nAs stated by the tribunal in *Mihaly*189:\n\n\"It may be and the Tribunal does not have to express an opinion on this, that during periods of lengthy negotiations even absent any contractual relationships obligations may arise such as the obligation to conduct the negotiations in good faith. These obligations if breached may entitle the innocent party to damages, or some other remedy. However, these remedies do not arise because an investment had been made, but rather because the requirements of proper conduct in relation to negotiation for an investment may have been breached.\"\n\nDoc. RLA-54, *Mihaly*, para. 51.\n\n331.\n\nAnd the tribunal in *Raymond Charles Eyre* concluded190:\n\n\"[\u2026] more than potential is necessary. There must have been substantive commitments and arrangements entered into, involving specific commitments and financial costs, all of which would entail both certain risks as well as possible benefits. The Tribunal can find only that the Hotel Project remained at best aspirational at the time [\u2026] Consequently, [claimant's] contributions rose only to the pre-investment level and he did not face the operational risk necessary for the Hotel Project to qualify as a protected investment [\u2026].\"\n\nSee also *Raymond Charles Eyre*, paras. 301-302.\n\n**b. Exceptions**\n-----------------\n\n332.\n\nThe vast majority of investment treaties do not provide for the protection of pre-investment activities or so-called \"pre-establishment rights\"191. The investor is expected to assume the costs of the pre-investment activities and the risk that the tentative project will not materialize. The State does not guarantee the recovery of expenditures with pre-investment activities192.\n\n*UNCTAD Series on International Investment Policies for Development \u2013 Investor State Disputes arising from Investment Treaties: A Review*, UN, New York, 2005, pp. 31-32.\n\nDoc. RLA-56, *Zhinvali*, paras. 406-408, 411.\n\n333.\n\nThere are, however, exceptions.\n\n334.\n\nFor instance, the North American Free Trade Agreement [\"**NAFTA**\"], and its successor, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement of 2020 [\"**USMCA**\"], do allow for the protection of pre-investment activities. Indeed, Art. 1339 of the NAFTA provides that:\n\n\"investor of a Party means [\u2026] a national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n335.\n\nThus, it seems that the Contracting Parties to NAFTA had the intention of protecting all phases of the formation of an investment \u2013 including the phase when an investor \"seeks to make\" or is in the process of \"making\" an investment.\n\n336.\n\nA similar language was incorporated into Art. 14.1 of the new USMCA, that defines \"investor\" as a person who:\n\n\"[\u2026] attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment [\u2026]\"\n\n337.\n\nAnd footnote 3 of this provision clarifies that:\n\n\"For greater certainty, the Parties understand that, for the purposes of the definitions of \"investor of a non-Party\" and \"investor of a Party\", an investor \"attempts to make\" an investment when that investor has taken concrete action or actions to make an investment, such as channeling resources or capital in order to set up a business, or applying for a permit or license.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n338.\n\nSumming up, the general rule is that pre-investment activities fall outside the scope of protection of the treaty, except if the language of the treaty provides otherwise.\n\n**c. Does the Indian-Mozambique BIT protect pre-investment activities?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nArt. 1(b) of the BIT states that193:\n\n\"(b) The term \"investment\" means every kind of asset established or acquired, including changes in the form of such investment in accordance with the national laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made [\u2026].\" [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\n340.\n\nArt. 2 of the BIT goes on to describe its scope194:\n\n\"This Agreement shall apply to all investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, accepted as such in accordance with its laws and regulations, whether made before or after the coming into force of this Agreement. It shall however not be applicable to claims or disputes which occurred prior to its entry into force.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\n341.\n\nThe terms of the BIT, construed in accordance with Art. 31(1) of the VCLT (\"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty\"195), support the conclusion that pre-investment activities that have not been consolidated into an investment, are not protected:\n\nDoc. CLA-5.\n\n342.\n\nFirst, pursuant to Art. 1(b), an \"asset\" to be protected must be \"established or acquired\"; the use of the simple past tense is significant, as it indicates that the investment has already occurred. There is no wording in the Treaty extending the protection to preceding activities, performed by the investor when seeking to establish or acquire its investment.\n\n343.\n\nSecond, pursuant to Art. 2, the scope of protection of the BIT only extends to \"investments made\". Once again, the use of the simple past tense shows that the protection extends to a consolidated investment, and not to activities that pertain to the process of making an investment.\n\n344.\n\nIn sum, the language of the BIT suggests that the Contracting Parties had no intention of protecting pre-investment activities made by investors prior to the actual establishment or acquisition of the investment.\n\n**3.4 Application to this case**\n--------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nThe Tribunal must now apply its findings to the present case.\n\n346.\n\nClaimant says that it holds a protected investment in the form of\n\n- a right to the direct award of a concession, created by a contract \u2013 the MOI \u2013 and certain Government decisions, plus\n\n- valuable know-how contained in the Pre-Feasibility Study196.\n\nRespondent counters that Claimant only made pre-investment expenditures that do not qualify as protected investments under the BIT197.\n\nC I, paras. 95-96, 257; C II, paras. 163, 510; C III, para. 218; CPHB, para. 7.\n\nR I, paras. 4, 21, 295, 362, *et seq*.; R II, paras. 4, 662, *et seq*.\n\n347.\n\nThe Tribunal, after carefully studying the Parties' submissions, the evidence marshalled and weighing the countervailing legal arguments, concludes that PEL never held an asset that qualifies as an investment for purposes of this specific BIT between India and Mozambique.\n\n348.\n\nThere are two preliminary (and undisputed) observations concerning certain key features of the Project:\n\n349.\n\nFirst, PEL never created an enterprise (either in the form of a branch or a subsidiary) located or incorporated in Mozambique, with the purpose of developing the Project (or, for that matter, with any other purpose). Claimant was asked by the Government to create a joint venture company in Mozambique, in which the CFM (the Mozambican rail operator) would participate as a junior partner; but after a few rounds of negotiations, the initiative stalled and the plans never materialized \u2013 there was pre-investment activity (*e.g*., discussions on whether to create a local corporation), but no investment.\n\n350.\n\nSecond, Mozambique never awarded the concession for the Project to PEL; there was no law passed or contract signed between PEL and Mozambique pursuant to which PEL was actually conferred a business concession198. Therefore, Claimant never obtained (for the purposes of Art. 1(b) of the BIT) a \"business concession [\u2026] conferred by law or under contract\".\n\nPEL recognizes this in its submissions (C II, para. 518; C III, para. 244).\n\n351.\n\nClaimant does not disagree with these observations. Its argument is different. It avers that:\n\n- It had a contractual right, enshrined in the MOI, to be awarded the concession of the Project, that became vested once Respondent approved the Pre-Feasibility Study and PEL exercised its right of first refusal by agreeing to proceed with the Project on 18 June 2012199; and\n\n- The content of the Pre-Feasibility Study constituted valuable intellectual property200.\n\nC I, paras. 258-259; C II, para. 518; C III, paras. 222, *et seq*., 244-250.\n\nC I, paras. 258-259; C II, para. 579; C III, paras. 261-263.\n\n352.\n\nIn Claimant's view, these \"assets\", would be protected under:\n\n- Art. 1(b)(iii) of the BIT, which extends protection to \"rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\"; and\n\n- Art. 1(b)(iv) of the BIT, which includes \"intellectual property rights, in accordance with the relevant laws of the respective Contracting Party\".\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established that a mechanic application of the terms of the BIT is not sufficient to establish that a certain \"asset\" qualifies as an investment201. Only assets that have the inherent characteristics of an investment may enjoy protection under the BIT. *Pro memoria*, these characteristics, of special relevance for investments in the form of contractual rights, are202:\n\n- A contribution of capital or equivalent value made by the investor;\n\n- The ownership of, or entitlement to, an asset with value, located in the host State, that results from such contribution;\n\n- An asset which is expected to produce a return, in the form of \"profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and fees\"; and\n\n- A certain duration.\n\n*See* section V.3.2 *supra*.\n\n*See* para. 318 *supra*.\n\n354.\n\nDo the Pre-Feasibility Study (**A.**) and/or the MOI (**B.**) meet the inherent features of an investment?\n\n**A. The Pre-Feasibility Study**\n--------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nArt. 1(b)(iv) includes among the list of assets which can constitute investments \"intellectual property rights, in accordance with the relevant laws of the respective Contracting Party\". PEL argues that it contributed the funds necessary to carry out the Pre-Feasibility Study, plus the know-how and human resources in the field of geology and engineering that served to identify and develop the Project and that this constituted an investment203.\n\nC II, para. 579.\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees.\n\n**a. Certain factual uncertainties**\n------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nThere are significant factual uncertainties regarding the funds actually contributed by Claimant, and the use by Mozambique of the know-how developed by Claimant and formalized in the Pre-Feasibility Study.\n\nCapital contribution\n--------------------\n\n358.\n\nThe only monetary contribution made by Claimant consisted in the payment of the costs and expenses incurred in the preparation and execution of the MOI, and subsequent elaboration of the Pre-Feasibility Study.\n\n359.\n\nBut Claimant failed to point to any evidence in the file regarding the actual amount expensed by PEL.\n\n360.\n\nThe only figure referred to (and only incidentally) is a sum of USD 4 million, mentioned in a letter sent by PEL on 18 February 2014204, after the Government of Mozambique had granted the concession to TML. In that letter Claimant requested compensation for damages suffered, in the amount of USD 4 million (plus a \"royalty\" for the identification of the Project of 0.5% of the investment)205.\n\nDoc. C-46. *See* also C I, para. 237.\n\nDoc. C-46, p. 3.\n\n361.\n\nThe letter is simply an averment: Claimant has not drawn the Tribunal's attention to any evidence which corroborates the figure of USD 4 million. In the document production phase Mozambique requested, and the Tribunal ordered, the exhibition of documents proving such expenses206. Claimant failed to submit any such documents. And at the Hearing, Mr. Daga, the officer of PEL leading the Project in Mozambique, confirmed that PEL had no records containing this information and that he could not recall the exact figure of such expenses207.\n\nRespondent's DPS, Request Nos. 10, 18, 38, 46.\n\nHT, Day 2, pp. 295-297 (Daga).\n\n362.\n\nWhatever the costs actually incurred by PEL in the execution of the MOI and preparation of the Pre-Feasibility Study, it would seem that, from a contractual point of view, Claimant has in any case waived its right to recover these amounts from Mozambique. Clause 4 of the MOI, whose wording is not disputed by the Parties, provides that208:\n\n\"The direct costs necessary to conduct the feasibility study shall be entirely borne by PEL.\"\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 4.\n\n363.\n\nThus, the Tribunal finds that there was no capital contribution.\n\nIntellectual property rights\n----------------------------\n\n364.\n\nClaimant has also failed to prove that it contributed or developed \"intellectual property rights, in accordance with\" Mozambican law. There is no evidence that \"the concept of the Project\", which Claimant allegedly developed, constitutes an asset protected under municipal intellectual property law. Furthermore, Claimant has pointed to no evidence that Mozambique irregularly transmitted to ITD/TML any proprietary information contained in the Pre-Feasibility Study. The record shows that TML, the consortium that was eventually awarded a concession contract, prepared its own feasibility study in 2015209 and, two years later, a more elaborate bankable feasibility study210.\n\nDoc. R-42, pp. 20, *et seq*.\n\nDoc. R-42; Doc. C-125, p. 145.\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n365.\n\nBe that as it may, even assuming, *arguendo*, that PEL had incurred significant expenses in the preparation and execution of the MOI and that in the Pre-Feasibility Study it developed intellectual property, protected under Mozambican law, these actions never transcended the threshold of pre-investment activity performed in the expectation of a future investment.\n\n366.\n\nSuch future investment \u2013 which once made would have enjoyed protection under the BIT \u2013 was to consist in the concession for the construction of a railway and ancillary port facilities, would imply the incorporation of an enterprise in Mozambique and would require the contribution of substantial amounts of capital \u2013 a concession which, alas, PEL never obtained. The planned investment was the concession, and Mozambique never awarded such concession to PEL. Claimant's activities remained at the level of pre-investment.\n\n**B. The MOI**\n--------------\n\n367.\n\nArt. 1(b)(iii) of the BIT extends protection to \"rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\"211. Claimant submits that the MOI was a contract entered into with Mozambique which had a financial value, and that, as such, it represented a protected investment under the BIT212.\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\nC I, paras. 257, *et seq*.; C II, paras. 518-522; CPHB, para. 7.\n\n**a. A preliminary issue**\n--------------------------\n\n368.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the MOI was executed. But there are three different versions of the contract, which show deviations from each other: there are two different English versions (one in possession of PEL and the other in the hands of the Republic) and one single version in Portuguese (in possession of both Parties):\n\n- Claimant invokes the English MOI in its possession213, which shows significant differences with the version held by Mozambique214; Claimant says that, in accordance with the wording of this version of the contract, once the Government had approved the Pre-Feasibility Study (as it actually did), PEL was entitled to a direct award, or in the terminology of the PPP Law, an \"*ajuste directo*\"215;\n\n- Respondent, in turn, invokes the English MOI in its possession216 and says that the contract established at best a contingent right: once the Government approved the Pre-Feasibility Study, PEL was entitled to negotiate with the CFM the terms of a joint venture, and if these negotiations succeeded, the joint venture would be directly awarded the concession; if unsuccessful, there would be a public tender, and PEL would be entitled to a 15% scoring advantage217.\n\nDoc. C-5A.\n\n*See* section III.2.B.b *supra*.\n\n*See* section V.2.1 *supra*.\n\nDoc. R-2.\n\n*See* section V.2.2 *supra*.\n\n369.\n\nThe Parties have engaged in an extensive discussion of what rights were afforded by the MOI to PEL. This is a contractual dispute regarding the interpretation, scope and content of the MOI, which falls outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Indeed, Clause 10 of the MOI clearly establishes that any dispute \"arising out of\" the MOI is subject to ICC arbitration, seated in Mozambique218.\n\nDoc. C-5A; Doc. R-2, Clause 10.\n\n370.\n\nThus, for the purposes of its analysis, the Tribunal will accept *pro tem* Claimant's interpretation as regards the content of the MOI (which grants a maximum scope of rights to Claimant): once the Government had approved PEL's Pre-Feasibility Study, PEL was entitled to an \"*ajuste directo*\" of the concession.\n\n**b. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n371.\n\nThe question that the Tribunal must answer is whether a contract of this nature \u2013 which incorporates the obligation by the purported investor to carry out a preliminary study, at its own cost, against the promise by the State of the direct award of a concession, if the study is accepted \u2013 constitutes a non-protected pre-investment activity or whether the legal relationship has sufficiently matured so as to constitute a protected investment.\n\n372.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, even assuming that the MOI entails a right to an \"*ajuste directo*\", it is a contract lacking the inherent features necessary to be considered an investment under the BIT. The Tribunal finds the following reasons compelling:\n\n(i) No contribution\n-------------------\n\n373.\n\nFirst, under the MOI, Claimant's side of the bargain was to prepare and submit a Pre-Feasibility Study. This was the only input that PEL undertook to deliver. In the preceding sub-section, the Tribunal has already established that the Pre-Feasibility Study *per se* only amounted to pre-investment activity, with the aim of facilitating the eventual awarding of the concession \u2013 which would, indeed, constitute a protected investment. And, as previously established, under Clause 4 of the MOI the costs of this pre-investment activity do not seem recoverable \u2013 even if the Government decided not to proceed with the Project.\n\n(ii) No certainty that the concession would be awarded\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nSecond, it is true that under the MOI (as interpreted by Claimant), Respondent assumed the obligation to carry out an \"*ajuste directo*\" of the concession in PEL's favor. But this obligation did not guarantee that PEL would actually obtain the concession: the administrative process was at a very early stage, and was subject to a number of conditions, which created significant uncertainties.\n\n375.\n\nThe first uncertainty was that once Mozambique had approved the Pre-Feasibility Study, PEL was required to negotiate with the CFM the creation of a joint venture219 \u2013 a condition which PEL accepted on 18 June 2012220. A failure to reach such agreement (and the evidence shows that CFM was reluctant to enter into such joint venture) would in any case jeopardize the direct award of the concession.\n\nDoc. C-11.\n\nDoc. C-12.\n\n376.\n\nThe second uncertainty was that the administrative process was at a very early stage.\n\n377.\n\nArt. 9 of the PPP Regulation established the \"*fases do processo*\" of contracting a PPP, in general (*i*.*e*., whether it is through public tender, direct award, or other methods)221:\n\n*\"1. O processo completo do empreendimento compreende, em regra, as seguintes fases:*\n\n*a) Concep\u00e7\u00e3o;*\n\n*b) Defini\u00e7\u00e3o dos princ\u00edpios b\u00e1sicos orientadores;*\n\n*c) Elabora\u00e7\u00e3o dos estudos de viabilidade t\u00e9cnica, ambiental e econ\u00f3mico-financeira;*\n\n*d) Promo\u00e7\u00e3o da iniciativa do empreendimento e lan\u00e7amento do respectivo concurso;*\n\n*e) An\u00e1lise e avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das propostas dos concorrentes;*\n\n*f) Adjudica\u00e7\u00e3o;*\n\n*g) Negocia\u00e7\u00e3o;*\n\n*h) Aprova\u00e7\u00e3o do empreendimento e do respectivo projecto de investimento;*\n\n*i) Celebra\u00e7\u00e3o do contrato*;\n\n*j) Passagem do empreendimento;*\n\n*k) Implementa\u00e7\u00e3o;*\n\n*l) Gest\u00e3o, explora\u00e7\u00e3o e manuten\u00e7\u00e3o;*\n\n*m) Monitoria e avalia\u00e7\u00e3o;*\n\n*n) Devolu\u00e7\u00e3o\"*.\n\n*2. A entidade respons\u00e1vel pela tutela sectorial pode dispensar a observ\u00e2ncia das fases previstas nas al\u00edneas a) a c) do n\u00famero anterior, quando a proposta do projecto do empreendimento contenha toda a informa\u00e7\u00e3o exig\u00edvel nos termos das referidas al\u00edneas e em condi\u00e7\u00f5es tais que permitam a an\u00e1lise e avalia\u00e7\u00e3o, nos termos previstos nos artigos 19 e 32 do presente Regulamento, da proposta desse empreendimento*.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nDoc. RLA-7 (POR); Doc. CLA-64 (ENG).\n\n378.\n\nArt. 17.3 of the PPP Regulation states that, the procedure of \"*ajuste directo*\" comprises the same phases described in Art. 9, adapted due to the fact that there is no public tender222:\n\n\"[\u2026] *compreende as fases previstas no artigo 9 deste Regulamento, com a devida adapta\u00e7\u00e3o relativamente ao n\u00e3o lan\u00e7amento do concurso*.\"\n\nDoc. RLA-7 (POR); Doc. CLA-64 (ENG).\n\n379.\n\nDuring the Hearing, the Parties' experts discussed how Art. 9 applied in case of \"*ajuste directo*\". They agreed that223:\n\n- Step \"d) *Promo\u00e7\u00e3o da iniciativa do empreendimento e lan\u00e7amento do respectivo concurso*\" did not apply to the \"*ajuste directo*\"; and that in step \"e) *An\u00e1lise e avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das propostas dos concorrentes*\" the \"*An\u00e1lise e avalia\u00e7\u00e3o*\" refers to a single proposal; and\n\n- All other phases apply to both proceedings.\n\nHT, Day 7, pp. 1652-1654 (Medeiros); HT, Day 8, pp. 1752-1759 (Muenda).\n\n380.\n\nTherefore, even assuming that Claimant under the MOI had the right to an \"*ajuste directo*\", the following steps of the process remained outstanding224:\n\n\"[\u2026]\n\n*g) Negocia\u00e7\u00e3o;*\n\n*h) Aprova\u00e7\u00e3o do empreendimento e do respectivo projecto de investimento;*\n\n*i) Celebra\u00e7\u00e3o do contrato* [\u2026]\".\n\nDoc. RLA-7 (POR); Doc. CLA-64 (ENG).\n\n381.\n\nIn other words: even after the approval of the Pre-Feasibility Study, the actual investment \u2013 the awarding of the concession with the \"execution of the contract\" \u2013 still required the \"negotiation\" of the terms between the State and the prospective investor (including elements so important as duration and determination of concessionary fees) and a final \"approval\" by the State and by the investor \u2013 who at all times retained the right to abandon the Project.\n\nNo expectation of returns\n-------------------------\n\n382.\n\nThird, and finally, a fundamental characteristic of all investments is that the contribution is made in the expectation of \"returns\", which Art. 1(e) of the BIT defines as \"profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and fees\"225.\n\nDoc. CLA-1.\n\n383.\n\nThe purpose of the MOI and Pre-Feasibility Study was not to generate \"returns\" for the benefit of Claimant, but to give Claimant the opportunity to obtain a concession for the construction of the Project, subject to multiple conditions (that it entered into a joint venture with the national railroad company, that it accepted the terms and conditions of the concession, that it reached agreement with the shippers of the coal, that it did not exercise its right to withdraw from the Project\u2026). The return would only come at a later stage, once Claimant had actually obtained the concession \u2013 and it is only at this stage when Claimant could be said to hold a protected investment under the Treaty.\n\n**\\* \\* \\***\n\n384.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that the MOI and the Pre-Feasibility Study do not possess the inherent characteristics of an investment. The MOI and the Pre-Feasibility Study constitute paradigmatic pre-investment activities, which, as previously discussed226, are not protected by the India-Mozambique BIT.\n\n*See* section V.3.3C.c *supra*.\n\n**3.5 Final considerations**\n----------------------------\n\n385.\n\nAll things considered, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant held no investment for the purposes of Art. 1(b) of the Treaty, and, accordingly, that the Tribunal does not have *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over PEL's claims.\n\n386.\n\nThe Tribunal has not reached this decision lightly. It has considerable sympathy for PEL's frustration: PEL signed the MOI with Mozambique, with the intention of making a significant capital contribution for the development of the country. Inexplicably, there are two English versions of the MOI with significant differences. Claimant has proven beyond any doubt that the English version in its possession was duly signed by both parties; but this version is different from the Portuguese MOI, which was also signed by both. It was Respondent who was responsible for the preparation of the execution copies and who organized the signing ceremony at the Ministry \u2013 and Respondent has failed to provide any satisfactory explanation for its inability to locate its own original English MOI.\n\n387.\n\nIn any event, there was no satisfactory explanation either for the differences between PEL's English MOI and both Portuguese versions.\n\n388.\n\nUpon signature of the MOI, PEL then prepared at its own expense a Pre-Feasibility Study to determine \u2013 albeit preliminarily \u2013 the viability of the Project. The Pre-Feasibility Study was approved by Mozambique and PEL sat down with the CFM to negotiate a joint venture \u2013 but no agreement was reached. Thereafter, Mozambique decided to launch a public tender to award a concession for the Project. Albeit under protest, PEL decided to participate in this tender.\n\n389.\n\nBut Mozambique then changed its opinion: in April 2013 the Council of Ministers took the decision of inviting Claimant to engage in direct negotiations of the terms of a concession that could be granted directly to PEL. The Government invited PEL to post a guarantee worth several million USD and to obtain commitments from the mining companies which would provide the coal to be shipped. PEL complied with the first condition and was in the process of securing the commitments.\n\n390.\n\nBut less than a month thereafter, in May 2013, the Council of Ministers made a U-turn and changed its opinion: without providing any satisfactory explanation other than stating that it had spoken with \"several stakeholders\" and that it had reviewed the legal and regulatory PPP framework, the Government opted to continue with the public tender and directed PEL to participate in it, putting an end to any expectation of a direct negotiation of the concession.\n\n391.\n\nIn sum: Claimant conducted several activities in Mozambique with the goal of obtaining a concession, but such activities never surpassed the pre-activity threshold and never matured into a protected investment. Ultimately, PEL has a pre-investment dispute *vis-\u00e0-vis* Mozambique, and the proper forum to solve such dispute is a contractual ICC Arbitration, where the Parties should have a full opportunity to resolve their contractual claims.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n392.\n\nIn this final section, the Tribunal will establish and allocate the costs of this arbitration [\"**Costs of Arbitration**\"]. The Tribunal will first determine the applicable rules (**1.**) and then analyze each category of Costs of Arbitration: the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the PCA, and other Tribunal costs (**2.**), and the fees and expenses incurred by the Parties for their defense in the arbitration (**3.**). The Tribunal will finally make its decision (**4.**).\n\n**1. Applicable rules**\n-----------------------\n\n393.\n\nArts. 38 to 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules govern the determination and allocation of the Costs of Arbitration. Art. 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides the general rule that the Tribunal shall fix the Costs of Arbitration in its award. These Costs are composed of227:\n\n\"(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\"\n\nArt. 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n394.\n\nThus, the Costs of Arbitration include:\n\n- The fees and expenses of the arbitrators, of the appointing authority, of any other assistance required by the tribunal, and the expenses of the PCA, under paras. (a), (b), (c) and (f) of Art. 38 [the \"**Administrative Costs**\"];\n\n- The reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the \"successful party\" in the course of the arbitration, as well as the travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the tribunal, under paras. (d) and (e) of Art. 38 [the \"**Legal Costs**\"].\n\n395.\n\nFurthermore, Arts. 40(1) and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules establish that:\n\n\"1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n396.\n\nIt follows that, in principle, the Costs of Arbitration shall be borne by the losing party; nevertheless, the Tribunal enjoys ample discretion to apportion the Costs differently, if it considers that it is reasonable to do so considering the circumstances of the case.\n\n**2. Administrative costs**\n---------------------------\n\n397.\n\nIn accordance with Art. 41 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Parties deposited the equivalent of **USD 1,234,719** with the PCA as an advance for the Administrative Costs, as follows:\n\n- Claimant's deposits: **EUR 100,000** (which was converted into **USD 117,779.30** upon receipt) and **USD 850,000**; and\n\n- Respondent's deposits: **EUR 100,000** (which was converted into **USD 116,939.70** upon receipt) and **USD 150,000**.\n\n398.\n\nPursuant to the Terms of Appointment, the fees of the members of the Tribunal were determined at the rate of USD 375 per hour for all work carried out in connection with the arbitration, and USD 3,000 per day for hearings that were longer than four hours, plus VAT, if applicable. In addition, the members of the Tribunal shall be reimbursed for all disbursements and charges reasonably incurred in connection with the arbitration, including but not limited to travel expenses, telephone, fax, delivery, printing, and other expenses228.\n\nTerms of Appointment, paras. 89-91.\n\n399.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal are hereby fixed as follows:\n\n- Professor Guido Santiago Tawil: USD 216,093.50 (fees) and USD 11,907.17 (expenses);\n\n- Mr. Hugo Perezcano D\u00edaz: USD 197,062.50 (fees) and USD 7,052.32 (expenses); and\n\n- Professor Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto: USD 246,538.52 (fees) and USD 4,563.68 (expenses).\n\n400.\n\nPursuant to the Terms of Appointment, Ms. Sofia de Sampaio Jalles was appointed as Administrative Secretary and is entitled to the reimbursement of justified reasonable personal disbursements for attending hearings and meetings229. Ms. De Sampaio Jalles' expenses in this arbitration amount to USD 2,391.27.\n\nTerms of Appointment, paras. 26-31, 94.\n\n401.\n\nFurthermore, the Parties agreed that the PCA would administer this arbitration and that the PCA's administrative tasks would be billed in accordance with the PCA's schedule of fees230. The PCA's fees amount to USD 162,857.17 and its expenses amount to USD 5,689.01.\n\nTerms of Appointment, para. 22.\n\n402.\n\nOther administrative costs, including the costs of bank transactions, printing, courier, live transcription, AV/IT support, interpretation, and all other expenses relating to the proceedings, amount to USD 162,129.50.\n\n403.\n\nBased on the above figures, the combined Administrative Costs \u2013 *i*.*e*., costs covered in paras. (a), (b), (c) and (f) of Art. 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules \u2013 amount to USD 1,016,284.64. This amount shall be deducted from the deposit established by the Parties. Since Claimant deposited a significantly larger share of the advance on costs, the unexpended balance of USD 218,434.36 shall be returned to Claimant, subject to any associated bank transfer or exchange fees.\n\n**3. Legal costs**\n------------------\n\n404.\n\nOn 18 August 2023, the Parties submitted their Statements of Costs [previously defined, respectively, for Claimant and Respondent, \"**C SofC**\" and \"**R SofC**\"]. With regard to paras. (d) and (e) of Art. 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Parties' claims for Legal Costs are set out below.\n\n**3.1 Claimant's position**\n---------------------------\n\n405.\n\nClaimant requests compensation for all the costs and expenses of the arbitration, including Administrative and Legal Costs, as well as its third-party funding's costs and expenses231.\n\nC SofC, para. 25(a).\n\n406.\n\nClaimant submits that it has incurred [REDACTED] and Claimant asks that Mozambique be ordered to bear in full these costs both if Claimant is considered the successful233 or the unsuccessful party234.\n\nC SofC, para. 4.\n\nC SofC, paras. 5-7.\n\n407.\n\nPrimarily, Claimant argues that under the UNCITRAL Rules a party can be considered successful \u2013 for the purposes of costs allocation \u2013 when it \"generally prevailed in the overall outcome\" of the proceedings, even though it may not have succeeded in every specific claim brought. PEL should be considered to have met such standard, since it has proven the jurisdiction of the tribunal and a breach of the BIT235.\n\nC SofC, para. 4.\n\n408.\n\nAlternatively, in the case that Claimant would not be considered the successful party, Respondent's conduct justifies a departure from the general standard of \"costs follow the event\". Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal should still award PEL all the costs borne in connection with the present proceedings236. More specifically, *inter alia*, Respondent has237:\n\n- Launched a parallel contractual arbitration;\n\n- Raised various groundless jurisdictional and admissibility objections;\n\n- Refused to cooperate in the document production phase; and\n\n- Refused to pay the PCA's deposit.\n\nC SofC, para. 5.\n\nC SofC, para. 6.\n\n409.\n\nMoreover, if Claimant is awarded any sum in these proceedings, either by being awarded costs or damages, PEL asks to be refunded the success fee of its counsel and the fees of the third-party funder238.\n\nFor a more detailed quantification of such costs, see C SofC, para. 14 and the table of possible outcomes in C SofC, para. 15.\n\n410.\n\nAdditionally, PEL requests to be awarded pre- and post-award interest on any costs allocated in its favor, with a rate fixed either at the US prime plus 2% or Respondent's cost of borrowing239.\n\nC SofC, para. 23.\n\n**3.2 Respondent's position**\n-----------------------------\n\n411.\n\nMozambique asks that Claimant and its third-party funder240 be ordered to pay all the costs incurred by Respondent in connection with the present proceedings, including all Administrative and Legal Costs241. Respondent submits that it has incurred **USD 3,902,744.36** in Legal Costs242.\n\nR SofC, paras. 27-29.\n\nR SofC, para. 25.\n\nR SofC, para. 1.\n\n412.\n\nPrimarily, based on Art. 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, Mozambique considers that the costs of the arbitration should be borne by the unsuccessful party. In order to prevail, it argues that it would only need to succeed in one of its jurisdictional objections243.\n\nR SofC, paras. 5-6.\n\n413.\n\nAlternatively, even if Claimant were to succeed partially or even on all the jurisdictional objections and be entitled to some relief on the merits, PEL should bear the costs of the present proceedings related to:\n\n- The contractual issues arising out of the MOI, since the jurisdiction regarding said matters lies with the ICC Tribunal244; as well as\n\n- The costs associated with Claimant's third damages submission, considered to be purely speculative by Respondent245.\n\nR SofC, paras. 16-23.\n\nR SofC, para. 24.\n\n414.\n\nRegarding these two aspects, Mozambique argues that the Tribunal should take into account the aggravation on costs due to the unnecessary burdening of the proceedings created solely by Claimant, who should therefore bear the related costs246.\n\nR SofC, paras. 14-16 and 26.\n\n415.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent asks to be granted post-award interest accruing at the short-term U.S. Treasury rate until receipt of payment of all costs awarded to it247.\n\nR SofC, para. 37.\n\n**4. The Tribunal's decision**\n------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nBoth Parties have requested an award on costs, each arguing that the Tribunal should adopt the \"costs follow the event\" criterion but recognizing that the Tribunal is free to depart from such principle and to take into account the particular circumstances of the case.\n\n417.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis was limited to one jurisdictional objection and ultimately Respondent is the successful party, since the Tribunal has recognized that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the case.\n\n418.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, in the exercise of its broad discretion under Art. 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, decides to depart from the principle that costs follow the event and to order each Party to bear its own Costs. In reaching this decision the Tribunal finds the following reasons compelling:\n\n419.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal recognizes that there was a genuine dispute between the Parties as to the existence or non-existence of an investment. To reach this difficult decision the Tribunal had to analyze and consider the Parties' submissions in full, and all the evidence available on the record. In other words, the briefing by the Parties on matters other than the *ratione materiae* jurisdictional objection was not in vain and the start of this arbitration was legitimate.\n\n420.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal is bound to take into account Respondent's conduct. The Tribunal understands that Mozambique was not satisfied with the start of this UNCITRAL arbitration. Mozambique chose to start a parallel ICC Arbitration, arguing that this would be a more appropriate forum to solve the dispute. That may well be the case, but this did not entitle Mozambique to repeatedly try to derail these proceedings, by filing multiple requests for stay or by asking for an anti-arbitration injunction from the ICC Tribunal.\n\n421.\n\nRespondent has also failed to cooperate in this arbitration by not paying a part of its share of the proceedings. Good faith requires parties to participate in arbitration proceedings willingly and to share the costs of the arbitration proceedings, even when they dispute the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n422.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal orders each Party to bear its own Legal Costs and to split equally the Administrative Costs.\n\n423.\n\nThe Administrative Costs amount to USD 1,016,284.64. Considering that Claimant has paid a larger share of the Administrative Costs, the unexpended amount of the deposit shall be returned to Claimant (in the amount of USD 218,434.36) and Respondent is ordered to reimburse Claimant in the amount of USD 241,202.62. This amount should be paid by Mozambique within one month of this award, and from that date on will accrue interest at the United States prime rate plus 2%248.\n\nC II, paras. 1080, 1152(f); CPHB, para. 75; C SofC, paras. 23, 25(b).\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n424.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal, by majority:\n\n1. Declares that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims submitted by Patel Engineering Limited;\n\n2. Orders that each Party shall bear its own Legal Costs;\n\n3. Orders that the Administrative Costs shall be split equally between the Parties, with the consequence that the Republic of Mozambique shall reimburse Patel Engineering Limited in the amount of USD 241,202.62; the Republic shall pay this amount within one month from the date of this award, and from that date any unpaid amount shall accrue interest at the United States prime rate plus 2%;\n\n4. Orders that the unexpended balance of the deposit held by the PCA shall be returned to Patel Engineering Limited in the amount of USD 218,434.36; and\n\n5. Dismisses all other prayers for relief.\n\n425.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken these decisions by majority, Arbitrator Mr. Hugo Perezcano D\u00edaz and Presiding Arbitrator Professor Juan Fern\u00e1ndez-Armesto voting in favour.

In light of the above, the Tribunal, by majority:\n\n1. Declares that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims submitted by Patel Engineering Limited;\n\n2. Orders that each Party shall bear its own Legal Costs;\n\n3. Orders that the Administrative Costs shall be split equally between the Parties, with the consequence that the Republic of Mozambique shall reimburse Patel Engineering Limited in the amount of USD 241,202.62; the Republic shall pay this amount within one month from the date of this award, and from that date any unpaid amount shall accrue interest at the United States prime rate plus 2%;\n\n4. Orders that the unexpended balance of the deposit held by the PCA shall be returned to Patel Engineering Limited in the amount of USD 218,434.36; and\n\n5. Dismisses all other prayers for relief.\n\n425. The Tribunal has taken these decisions by majority, Arbitrator Mr. Hugo Perezcano D\u00edaz and Presiding Arbitrator Professor Juan Fernandez-Armesto voting in favour. The dissenting Arbitrator, Professor Guido Santiago Tawil, explains his position in a dissenting separate opinion, which is attached.\"\n\nIn his dissenting opinion of that same day, Professor Guido Santiago Tawil disagreed with the Tribunal\u2019s decision that it lacked jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to adjudicate the claims submitted by Claimant in this case [the \"**Dissenting Opinion**\"].\n\nOn 8 March 2024, Claimant requested a one-week extension of the deadline of 30 days to submit corrections to the Award and the Dissenting Opinion. Respondent agreed to this extension, while reserving the right to respond if Claimant\u2019s submission exceeded the scope and bounds of post-award corrections. On that same day, the Tribunal confirmed the agreed extension.\n\nOn 15 March 2024, Claimant submitted a letter to the Tribunal requesting the correction of alleged errors in the Award and the Dissenting Opinion2 [the \"**Request for Correction**\"].\n\nOn 18 March 2024, the Tribunal granted Respondent the opportunity to respond to Claimant\u2019s Request for Correction by 22 April 20243.\n\nAward, paras. 424-425.\n\nCommunication C 94.\n\nCommunication A 64.\n\n6.\n\nOn 22 April 2024, Mozambique filed its response to Claimant\u2019s Request for Correction [the \"**Response**\"].\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal will first establish the standard for correction of an award under the applicable rules (**II.**). It will then analyze each of Claimant\u2019s proposed corrections (**III.**) and make its decision (**IV.**).\n\n**II. APPLICABLE STANDARD**\n---------------------------\n\n8.\n\nClaimant requests the correction of alleged errors in the Award and in the Dissenting Opinion, pursuant to Art. 36 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules [\"**UNCITRAL Rules**\"]4.\n\nRequest for Correction, paras. 1 and 26.\n\n9.\n\nRespondent, in turn, argues that Claimant is in fact seeking several substantive revisions to the Award and Dissenting Opinion, with the aim of editorializing and challenging the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning5. From Mozambique\u2019s point of view, Claimant\u2019s Request for Correction constitutes an inappropriate and improper use of Art. 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules and should be denied. Indeed, this provision only authorizes the correction of errors that are computational, clerical, typographical or of a similar nature: it does not encompass corrections of alleged mistakes of law, or of factual determinations or discretionary assessments made by the Tribunal6. Respondent submits that the strict narrow scope of corrections permitted under Art. 36 has been repeatedly affirmed by tribunals and doctrine7.\n\nResponse, p. 1.\n\nResponse, p. 1.\n\nResponse, p. 2.\n\nDiscussion\n----------\n\n10.\n\nOnce a final award has been issued, the arbitral tribunal is *functus officio*8*.* From the moment it is received by the parties, the arbitral award becomes final and binding, and the parties are obliged to comply without delay9. The tribunal may no longer change the terms of its decision.\n\nDoc. RLA-162, p. 5 of the PDF.\n\nArt. 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules: \"2. The award shall be made in writing and shall be final and binding on the parties. The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay\".\n\n11.\n\nNotwithstanding this general principle, in certain situations arbitral regulations and national arbitration laws allow a departure from the above principles. An example is the possibility of requesting the correction of an arbitral award under Art. 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which establishes that:\n\n\"1. Within thirty days after the receipt of the award, either party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal to correct in the award any errors in computation, any clerical or typographical errors, or any errors of similar nature. The arbitral tribunal may within thirty days after the communication of the award make such corrections on its own initiative.\n\n2. Such corrections shall be in writing, and the provisions of article 32, paragraphs 2 to 7, shall apply.\"\n\n12.\n\nPursuant to this provision, within 30 days of receipt of the award, a party may request the tribunal to correct a computational, clerical or typographical error, or \"any errors of similar nature\"; the Tribunal may also do so *sua sponte.* The idea behind Art. 36 is to avoid a distortion of the intended outcome of an arbitral dispute or the undermining of the award's validity10.\n\nDoc.

Indeed12:\n\n\"[...] the correction process is not a means for revisiting the substance of the award or for reconsidering the arbitral tribunal's reasoning.\"\n\nDoc.

REQUEST FOR CORRECTION**\n-------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal make the following corrections, pursuant to Art. 36(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules13:\n\ni) Correct paras. 269, 346, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 367, 388, and 391 of the Award;\n\nii) Consider whether additional corrections are necessary for paras. 354 to 383 of the Award, in light of the proposed corrections to Claimant\u2019s representation of its case; and\n\niii) Correct paras. 4 and 14 of the Dissenting Opinion.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 26.\n\n**1. The April 2013 Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision as part of Claimant\u2019s investment and \"undisputed\" observations**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimant\u2019s position**\n--------------------------\n\n16.\n\nFirst, PEL contends that the summary of Claimant\u2019s description of *\"investment\"* in paras. 351 and 352 of the Award is inaccurate and incomplete14. Claimant notes that the Tribunal appears to have relied upon descriptions of Claimant\u2019s investment from earlier pleadings; however, as is common in arbitration, the parties\u2019 positions evolved over the course of the proceedings15. According to Claimant, the most accurate description of its position on the content of its investment is reflected in its post-hearing brief16, where PEL submitted that17:\n\n\"PEL\u2019s investment in Mozambique included: (i) contractual rights under the MOI that had financial value, including the right to a direct award of the concession and the right of first refusal to implement the project; (ii) the direct award of the concession granted by the Council of Ministers; (iii) valuable know-how transferred to Mozambique with PEL\u2019s concept and the proprietary knowledge in the PFS; and (iv) funds contributed for the Preliminary Study and the PFS.\"\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 3.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 3.\n\nRequest for Correction, para.3, referring to CPHB, para. 7.\n\nCPHB, para. 7.\n\n17.\n\nPEL argues that when discussing whether PEL made an investment falling within the BIT\u2019s protective ambit, the Tribunal, by majority, only addressed certain aspects of PEL\u2019s investment in isolation: while the Tribunal discusses PEL\u2019s contractual \"right\" to a direct award in the MOI, it does not address the actual direct award granted to PEL by the April 2013 Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision - which, according to Claimant, is the most critical piece of evidence in its entire case18. It is Claimant\u2019s position that under Mozambican law, the April 2013 Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision in and of itself vested PEL with rights having economic value which could not be taken away without compensation - independent of and in addition to any contractual rights that PEL received through the MOI19.\n\nRequest for Correction, paras. 4-5.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 6.\n\n18.\n\nTherefore, Claimant argues that the Tribunal should correct paras. **346**, **351** and **352** of the Award to amend the description of the investment20. According to Claimant, the omission of the April 2013 Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision from the description of the investments appears to have impacted other aspects of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning21:\n\n- The April 2013 Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision granted PEL a non-contractual right that exists independently of the MOI and does not fall within the ICC Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction; this arbitration was the only arbitral forum available to Claimant to address the violations of the rights it gained through the Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision22;\n\n- The Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, by majority, analyses Claimant\u2019s investment in isolated parts; it is unclear if the *ratio* would remain the same if the direct award granted by the April 2013 Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision had been considered23; the Tribunal failed to address Claimant\u2019s argument that it should view the totality of PEL\u2019s activities holistically and avoid separating the protected assets - again leading Claimant to query whether the Tribunal should correct its ratio24.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 7.\n\nRequest for Correction, paras. 8 *et seq.*\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 9.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 10.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 11.\n\n19.\n\nSecond, PEL argues that the Tribunal incorrectly states that it is *\"undisputed\"* that *\"Mozambique never awarded the concession for the Project to PEL\"\"*. Claimant has repeatedly disputed this. While it is undisputed that the Parties never signed the finalized concession contract, this is an entirely separate matter from awarding the concession as a matter of Mozambican procurement law25.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 12.\n\n20.\n\nClaimant says that it has demonstrated that Mozambique awarded the concession to PEL in the April 2013 Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision: this was the *\"adjudica\u00e7\u00e3o\"* phase of the procurement procedure set forth in the \"PPP Law and Regulations\" and, once that direct award was granted, it could not be arbitrarily revoked. After said Decision, Mozambique was legally obligated to proceed to the next phase of the procedure - the *\"negociagao\";* and Mozambique started this phase, only to reverse course abruptly, purport to revoke the direct award, and then grant the same concession to another party26.\n\nRequest for Correction, paras. 13-14.\n\n21.\n\nTherefore, PEL asks the Tribunal to amend paras. **269**, **348**, **350** and **351** of the Award27.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 15.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n22.\n\nMozambique, in turn, argues that the purported corrections sought by PEL fall outside the scope of errors contemplated under Art. 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules. PEL seeks to rewrite the Tribunal\u2019s recitation of facts and of the Parties\u2019 positions, nitpicking at the ways in which the Tribunal, by majority, has summarized Claimant\u2019s position and the facts at issue. PEL seeks to compel the Tribunal to add significant substantive arguments into the Award28.\n\nResponse, p. 3.\n\n23.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal is not required to recite every argument of Claimant. Furthermore, the fact that the Tribunal has not recounted the Parties\u2019 position in the exact manner Claimant wishes is far from the type of errors that can be corrected under Art. 36. PEL attempts to insert its preferred recitation of its position into the Award; this is an improper substantive revision of the Award29.\n\nResponse, p. 3.\n\n24.\n\nAs the Request for Correction confirms, the issues that Claimant seeks to inject into the Award were contested before the Tribunal and were ultimately rejected. There is no indication that the Tribunal failed to consider, or misunderstood, any arguments of the Parties. The fact that the Tribunal does not ascribe the same significance or effect to the April 2013 Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision as PEL, does not render the Award infirm, incomplete, or inaccurate, and does not entitle PEL to reargue its case under the guise of \"corrections\"30.\n\nResponse, p. 3.\n\n**C. Decision of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nPEL seeks to make the following corrections to the Award (mark-up by Claimant):\n\n- Para. 269:\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s decision**\n\n269. There is no dispute regarding the fact that Mozambique neve~~r awarded PEL a concession to develop the Project~~ signed a finalized concession agreement with *PEL.* What the Parties discuss is whether Claimant's rights enshrined in the MOL together with its expenditures and activities (prior to Mozambique's decision to award a concession to ITD/TML. and not to Claimant and the direct award and  *ensuing rights the Council of Ministers granted PEL in April 2013* are covered investments under the BIT.\n\n- Para. 346:\n\n346. Claimant says that it holds a protected investment in the form of\n\n~~a right to th~~**e** ~~direct award of a concession, erent~~**e**~~d by a contract\u2014th~~**s** ~~MOI\u2014 and c~~**e**~~rtain. Gov~~**e**~~rnm~~**e**~~nt decisions, plus~~\n\n*- - contractual rights under the MOI that had financial value, including the right to a direct award of the concession and the right of first refusal to implement the project.*\n\n*- - the direct award of the concession* (*\"adjudica\u00e7\u00e3o*\") *granted by the Council of Ministers in April 2013 - via a decision that gave PEL a vested right under Mozambican law that could not be withdrawn unilaterally without compensation.*\n\n.\\_\\_\\_\\_valuable know-how *transferred to Mozambique with PEL's concept and the* proprietary knowledge contained in the Pre-Feasibility Study196-. plus\n\n*- - funds contributed for the Preliminary Study and the PFS.*\n\n- Para. 348:\n\n348. There are two preliminary ~~(and undisput~~e~~d)~~ observations concerning certain key features of the Project:\n\n- Para. 350:\n\n350. Second. ~~Mozambique n~~e~~v~~e~~r award~~e~~d th~~e ~~conc~~e~~ssion for th~~e ~~Proj~~e~~ct to PEL:~~ *although Claimant asserts that Mozambique\u2019s Council of Ministers granted PEL a direct award of the concession,* there was no law passed or contract signed between PEL and Mozambique pursuant to which PEL was actually conferred a business concession198. Therefore, Claimant never obtained (for the purposes of Art. 1(b) of the BIT) a \"business concession [...] conferred by law or under contract\".\n\n- Para. 351:\n\n351. Claimant disagrees~~do~~**e**~~s not disagr~~**ee** ~~with th~~**e**~~s~~**e** ~~obs~~**e**~~rvations. Its argum~~**e**~~nt is diff~~**e**~~r~~**e**~~nt.~~ It avers that:\n\n- It had a contractual right, enshrined in the MOL to be awarded the concession of the Project, that became vested once Respondent approved the Pre-Feasibility Study and PEL exercised its right of first refusal by agreeing to proceed with the Project on 18 June 2012199; ~~and~~\n\n~~- The cont~~e~~nt of the Pre-Feasibility Study constitut~~e~~d valuable int~~e~~ll~~e~~ctual property200-.~~\n\n*- It was granted a direct award through the Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision of April 2013, i.e., a right to implement the Project via a concession agreement that was to be negotiated in good faith with the Government;*\n\n*- It had valuable know-how in the form of PEL\u2019s Project concept and proprietary knowledge contained in the pre-Feasibility Study, which PEL transferred, to Mozambique and Mozambique appropriated to launch its public tender: and*\n\n*- It had contributed funds for the Preliminary Study and the Pre-Feasibility Study.*\n\n- Para. 352:\n\n352. In Claimant's view, these \"assets\", would be protected under:\n\n- Art. 1(b)(iii) of the BIT, which extends protection to \"rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\"; ~~and~~\n\n-\\_\\_Art. 1(b)(iv) of the BIT, which includes \"intellectual property rights, in accordance with the relevant laws of the respective Contracting Party\" -.and/or\n\n*- Art. 1(b)(v)of the BIT, which includes a \"business concession [...] conferred by law or under contract\".*\n\n26.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant argues that the Tribunal should consider whether further corrections are required to paras. 354 to 383 of the Award, in light of Claimant's representation of its case.\n\n27.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that none of Claimant's proposed corrections consist of computational, clerical, typographical or \"of similar nature\" errors. Rather, Claimant takes issue with the Tribunal's findings and how it recounted PEL's position, as well as the Tribunal's reasoning in the Award.\n\n28.\n\nFor that reason, Claimant's proposed corrections extrapolate the scope of Art. 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules and are inadmissible.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms that it fully considered Claimant's position. Claimant has not suggested any corrections to section V.2 of the Award, which is entitled *\"The Parties' positions\"* and contains a specific sub-section 2.1 dedicated to *\"Claimant's position\";* that section clearly reflects that PEL's position was that it held a protected investment in the form of, *inter alia*, a \"right to a direct award of the concession to implement the Project, by virtue of [...] the April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision\" (see, e.g., paras. 245 and 249 of the Award).\n\n30.\n\nThis is further made clear in paras. 228 and 270, where the Tribunal notes that Claimant's position is that:\n\n\"228. [\u2026] the Council of Ministers offered again a direct award to PEL, only to reverse its decision a few weeks later on the basis of unfounded reasons.\"\n\nand\n\n\"270. Essentially, PEL avers that it held the following \"assets\" that are protected under the BIT:\n\n- Under the MOI and pursuant to the Government\u2019s decision to approve the Pre-Feasibility Study, Claimant had the right to obtain a direct award of the concession contract to implement the Project; Claimant\u2019s right to a direct award is confirmed by the April 2013 Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision; and, as an ancillary right, Claimant had a first right of refusal under the MOI, that consisted in Claimant\u2019s prerogative to accept developing the Project and to sign the concession agreement, or to refuse, in which case the Government could offer the Project to third parties; and\n\n- The valuable know-how transferred to the State with its Project concept, contained in the Preliminary Study and the Pre-Feasibility Study.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n31.\n\nThese paragraphs accurately reflect Claimant\u2019s position that the April 2013 Council of Ministers\u2019 Decision granted PEL a direct award of the concession. The Tribunal duly considered the Claimant\u2019s position that the Council of Ministers had awarded it a concession, subject to negotiation and execution of the precise terms and conditions of such concession, as shown in paras. 245, 249 and 270 of the Award.\n\n32.\n\nThe paragraphs that Claimant seeks the Tribunal to modify all fall under the umbrella of section V.3.4, entitled *\"The Tribunal\u2019s decision\"*. Claimant is asking the Tribunal to revise its findings and reasoning (not the Claimant\u2019s position). In para. 269 the Tribunal determined that there was \"no dispute regarding the fact that Mozambique never awarded PEL a concession to develop the Project\", even if the Parties disagreed as to whether certain rights were conferred to PEL or not.\n\n33.\n\nPara. 346 clearly states that, according to PEL, it holds a protected investment in the form of a \"right to the direct award of a concession, created by [...] certain Government decisions\" (including the April 2013 Council of Ministers' Decision):\n\n\"346. Claimant says that it holds a protected investment in the form of\n\n- a right to the direct award of a concession, created by a contract - the MOI - and certain Government decisions, plus\n\n- valuable know-how contained in the Pre-Feasibility Study.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n34.\n\nClaimant\u2019s proposed corrections to paras. 348 to 352 seek as well to revise the Tribunal\u2019s findings and reasoning. In para. 347 the Tribunal, by majority, found that PEL never held an asset that qualifies as an investment for the purposes of the specific BIT between India and Mozambique. In paras. 348 to 350, the Tribunal made two preliminary observations that it determined to have been undisputed:\n\n\"348. There are two preliminary (and undisputed) observations concerning certain key features of the Project:\n\n349. First, PEL never created an enterprise (either in the form of a branch or a subsidiary) located or incorporated in Mozambique, with the purpose of developing the Project (or, for that matter, with any other purpose). Claimant was asked by the Government to create a joint venture company in Mozambique, in which the CFM (the Mozambican rail operator) would participate as a junior partner; but after a few rounds of negotiations, the initiative stalled and the plans never materialized - there was pre-investment activity (e.g., discussions on whether to create a local corporation), but no investment.\n\n350. Second, Mozambique never awarded the concession for the Project to PEL; there was no law passed or contract signed between PEL and Mozambique pursuant to which PEL was actually conferred a business concession198. Therefore, Claimant never obtained (for the purposes of Art. 1(b) of the BIT) a \"business concession [...] conferred by law or under contract\".\"\n\n35.\n\nIn paras. 348 to 350 of the Award the Tribunal determined that there was no \"concession\" as defined under the BIT. In footnote 198 to para. 350, the Tribunal notes that \"PEL recognizes this in its submissions (C II, para. 518; C III, para. 244)\" and that it was \"common ground that PEL was not physically granted a concession agreement\"31.\n\nThese submissions state the following:  \n**C II**: \"518 While PEL may not have physically signed a concession agreement (that failing being part and parcel of Respondent\u2019s breach of the Treaty), it acquired an immediate and direct right to a concession that became vested in PEL once Respondent approved the PFS and PEL exercised its right of first refusal by agreeing to proceed with the Project.\"  \n**C III**: \"244 First, while it is common ground that PEL was not physically granted a concession agreement, this is part and parcel of Mozambique\u2019s delict. Respondent cannot be heard to use the fact that PEL never received the actual concession as a defence when it was Respondent\u2019s breach of the Treaty that resulted in PEL not receiving the concession in the first place. Besides, whether PEL did or did not receive the physical concession is irrelevant here for jurisdictional purposes.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal found that Claimant\u2019s argument was different as established in paras. 351 and 352.\n\n37.\n\nIn view of the above, Claimant\u2019s request for corrections of paras. 269, 346, 348, 350, 351 and 352 of the Award is rejected.\n\n**2. The MOI**\n--------------\n\n**A. Claimant\u2019s position**\n--------------------------\n\n38.\n\nPEL further argues that the Tribunal incorrectly summarizes Claimant\u2019s main argument concerning the MOI. While Claimant does contend that the MTC granted PEL valuable rights in the MOI, PEL\u2019s argument in this regard is that, once the conditions precedent contained in the MOI were satisfied by June 2012 (*i*.*e*., the approval of the PFS by Mozambique and PEL\u2019s exercise of its right of first refusal), PEL\u2019s rights under the MOI vested. Those vested rights, in conjunction with the other components of PEL\u2019s investment in Mozambique, were protected under the BIT. Therefore, para. **367** of the Award should be amended as follows32:\n\n**B. The MOI**\n\n367. Art. 1(b)(iii) of the BIT extends protection to \"rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value\"211. Claimant submits that the MOI was a contract entered into with Mozambique *granting rights* which, *once vested,* had a financial value.-, ~~and that, as such, it~~ *Those vested rights, along with the direct award of the concession granted by the Council of Ministers, valuable know-how transferred to Mozambique with PEL\u2019s concept and the proprietary knowledge in the PFS, and funds contributed for the Preliminary' Study and the PFS*. represented a protected investment under the BIT212.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 16.\n\n**B. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n39.\n\nFor the reasons explained in paras. 22-24 *supra,* Mozambique objects to the purported \"correction\": the Tribunal is not required or permitted to make substantive changes to the Award because PEL believes its arguments could have been recounted or repeated in a manner more favorable to Claimant33.\n\nResponse, pp. 3-4.\n\n**C. Decision of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nOnce again, Claimant\u2019s proposed correction goes beyond the scope of Art. 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules and is therefore inadmissible.\n\n41.\n\nClaimant does not seek a correction of section V.2.1 of the Award, which contains the summary of its position and clearly reflects the same argument that Claimant would like to insert in para. 3 6 734. Rather, Claimant seeks to correct the Tribunal\u2019s findings and reasoning. The fact that, when making its decision, the Tribunal does not recount or restate the Parties\u2019 positions in the exact manner that Claimant now proposes does not render the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning improper or incorrect.\n\nSee Award, paras. 248 to 251.\n\n42.\n\nTherefore, Claimant\u2019s request for correction of para. 367 of the Award is rejected.\n\n**3. Negotiations with the CFM**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n43.\n\nClaimant argues that the Tribunal\u2019s description of PEL\u2019s purported negotiations with the CFM is inaccurate. PEL argues that nothing in the record suggests that PEL and CFM had any negotiations, let alone \"rounds of them\". Rather, the \"undisputed evidence demonstrates that PEL never had a chance to engage in any negotiations with the CFM\"35. Under Claimant\u2019s vision of the facts, there were no \"negotiations\" between PEL and the CFM to implement the Project at any time36. Therefore, the Tribunal should correct paras. **349** and **388** to say that the \"CFM refused to negotiate\"37 with PEL, as follows:\n\n- Para. 349:\n\n349. First. PEL never created an enterprise (either in the form of a branch or a subsidiary) located or incorporated in Mozambique, with the purpose of developing the Project (or, for that matter, with any other purpose). Claimant was asked by the Government to create a joint venture company in Mozambique, in which the CFM (the Mozambican rail operator) would participate as a junior partner: but *CFM refused* ro *negotiate and* ~~after a few rounds of negotiations,~~ the initiative stalled and the plans never materialized-there was pre-investment activity (e.g., discussions on whether to create a local corporation) but no investment\n\n- Para. 388:\n\n388. Upon signature of the MOI, PEL then prepared at its own expense a Pre-Feasibility Study to determine - albeit preliminarily - the viability of the Project. The Pre-Feasibility Study was approved by Mozambique and PEL *approached* ~~sat down with~~ the CFM to negotiate a joint venture - but ~~no agr~~ee~~m~~e~~nt was r~~e~~ach~~e~~d~~ *the CFM refused to negotiate with PEL-* Thereafter, Mozambique decided to launch a public tender to award a concession for the Project. Albeit under protest, PEL decided to participate in this tender.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 17.\n\nRequest for Correction, paras. 18-19.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 19.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n44.\n\nFor the reasons explained in paras. 22-24 *supra*, Mozambique objects to the purported \"correction\": the Tribunal is not required or permitted to make substantive changes to the Award because PEL believes its arguments could have been recounted or repeated in a manner more favorable to Claimant38.\n\nResponse, pp. 3-4.\n\n**C. Decision of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nOnce again, the amendments requested by Claimant fall outside the scope of Art. 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules: these are not computational, clerical, typographical or \"similar nature\" errors. Instead, Claimant seeks to redraft the Tribunal's findings of the facts of the case; paras. 349 and 388 both fall under the section of the \"*The Tribunal\u2019s decision\"*. Claimant's proposed corrections are an attempt to have the Tribunal reconsider its findings of the facts and are therefore rejected.\n\n**4. ICC proceedings**\n----------------------\n\n**A. Claimant\u2019s position**\n--------------------------\n\n46.\n\nFinally, Claimant argues that the Tribunal, by majority, and Professor Tawil, in para. 14 of his Dissenting Opinion, incorrectly state that Claimant has a \"full opportunity\" to solve its \"contractual\" dispute in the ICC Arbitration. This is untrue, according to Claimant, because39:\n\n\"[...] the most critical components of PEL\u2019s claim are not contractual in nature, and are therefore outside the ICC Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, and further because PEL no longer has the ability to raise new contractual claims in the ICC arbitration.\"\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 20.\n\n47.\n\nTherefore, Claimant requests the Tribunal to amend para. **391** of the Award as follows40:\n\n391. In sum: Claimant conducted several activities in Mozambique with the goal of obtaining a concession, but such activities never surpassed the pre-activity threshold and never matured into a protected investment. Ultimately, PEL has a pre-investment dispute vis-a-vis Mozambique.~~, and the proper forum to solve such disput~~e ~~is a contractual ICC Arbitration, wh~~e~~r~~e ~~th~~e ~~Parti~~e~~s should hav~~e ~~a full opportunity to r~~e~~solv~~e ~~th~~e~~ir contractual claims.~~\n\nand Professor Tawil to amend para. **14** of the Dissenting Opinion as follows41:\n\n***The ICC Arbitration is of a contractual basis and clearly differs from the dispute before us, based on the alleged violations of the Treaty. ~~While I~~** ~~expect that PEL will be granted a full opportunity to present its claims~~ **~~before the ICC Tribunal,~~ ~~i~~ It was this Treaty arbitration the natural fora in which such claims should have been discussed.***\n\nRequest for Correction, paras. 23, and 26.\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 25.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n48.\n\nMozambique argues that PEL, for its own reasons, declined to raise affirmative claims in the ICC Arbitration and to adhere to the jurisdictional findings of the ICC Tribunal. If PEL no longer has the ability to raise new contractual claims in the ICC Arbitration is a fact of PEL\u2019s own making and does not render inaccurate that the ICC proceedings afforded PEL a full opportunity to adjudicate its claims42.\n\nResponse, p. 4.\n\n**C. Decision of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nClaimant\u2019s request does not fall within the scope of the corrections permitted under Art. 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal, having considered the Parties\u2019 submissions in detail and considering all arguments and evidence put before it, concluded that there was a pre-investment dispute between PEL and Mozambique. This means that this UNCITRAL Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the dispute.\n\n51.\n\nThe MOI contains an arbitration clause in regard to any contractual rights under the MOI.\n\n52.\n\nThe proposed corrections of para. 391 of the Award and para. 14 of the Dissenting Opinion are inadmissible and Claimant\u2019s request is, therefore, rejected.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n53.\n\nIn view of the above, the Tribunal, by majority (Arbitrator Mr. Hugo Perezcano D\u00edaz and Presiding Arbitrator Professor Juan Fernandez-Armesto voting in favor), **dismisses** all the requests for correction of the Award submitted by Patel Engineering Ltd.\n\n54.\n\nAs to the requests for correction of the Dissenting Opinion, Arbitrator Professor Guido Santiago Tawil:\n\n- **Accepts** to correct para. 4 of the Dissenting Opinion, in light of the Parties\u2019 agreement that it contains minor clerical or typographical errors43, as follows:\n\n4. PEL prepared and submitted the PFS. which was approved by the **~~MTS~~** *MTC* on 15 June 20123. Although PEL informed Respondent three days later that it was exercising its right of first refusal4, the implementation of the project was not possible due to the **~~n~~e~~gativ~~e** *refusal* ofCFM (an entity of the Respondent) to invest in the Project and incorporate a company jointly with PEL as requested by the MTC when approving the PFS5.\n\n- **Dismisses** the request for correction of para. 14 of the Dissenting Opinion, which reflects an opinion of the Arbitrator and is not an error that falls within the scope of corrections permitted under Art. 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n**Place of Arbitration:** The Hague, the Netherlands. **Date: 25 June** 2024\n\nRequest for Correction, para. 24; Response, p. 4 and fn. 12."}]}
