INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") under the Energy Charter Treaty (\"**ECT**\"), which entered into force on April 16, 1998, with respect to the Federal Republic of Germany and the Kingdom of Spain, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute relates to measures adopted by the Respondent, which modified the regulatory and remuneration framework applicable to Concentrated Solar Power (\"**CSP**\") producers. The Claimant argues that these measures adversely affected its investment in Arenales Solar PS, S.L. (\"**Arenales Solar**\"), a Spanish company that owns a solar thermal power plant project with molten salt storage, located in the municipality of Mor\u00f3n de la Frontera, Seville (the \"**Project**\" or \"**Arenales Project**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Spain has breached its obligations under Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT. The Claimant asserts that it is entitled to compensation of no less than EUR 79 million for the damages caused to its investment as a result of the ECT violations.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES**\n-------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant is STEAG GmbH (\"**Steag**\"), a company incorporated under German law, with its registered office in Essen.\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (\"**Spain**\"), a sovereign State and Contracting Party to both the ECT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.\n\nHereinafter, the Claimant and the Respondent shall be collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\"\n\n**III. CONSENT TO ARBITRATION**\n-------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted a claim based on Article 26 of the ECT and the ICSID Convention against the Kingdom of Spain, as detailed in Section IV below. The Respondent is a Contracting Party to both the ECT and the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal finds that both Parties have provided written consent to this arbitration, without prejudice to the Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n**IV. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn January 9, 2015, the Centre received a Request for Arbitration from Steag against Spain, accompanied by documentary exhibits C-0001 to C-0008 (\"**Request for Arbitration**\"), in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n9.\n\nOn January 21, 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of its registration. In the registration notification, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to inform the Centre of any agreed stipulations regarding the number of arbitrators and their method of appointment, in accordance with Rule 7(c) of the Procedural Rules Applicable to the Initiation of ICSID Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings. Additionally, the Parties were invited to proceed with the constitution of an arbitral tribunal under Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 17, 2015, ICSID informed the Parties that unless they intervened in the proceedings or requested a suspension by July 21, 2015, the Secretary-General would issue an order taking note of the termination of the proceedings pursuant to Rule 45 of the Procedural Rules Applicable to Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn July 21, 2015, the Claimant appointed Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil as arbitrator, a national of the Argentine Republic,1 and proposed a method to the Respondent regarding the number of arbitrators and their appointment procedure. On the same date, the Centre informed the Parties that, in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, it would not take any action regarding the appointment of Dr. Tawil until the Parties reached an agreement on the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment.\n\nBy letter dated July 31, 2020, Dr. Tawil informed the Parties that he had recently acquired Portuguese nationality in addition to his Argentine nationality.\n\n12.\n\nThrough communications dated August 10, September 15, 18, and 24, 2015, the Parties exchanged proposals concerning the number of arbitrators and the appointment procedure. The Parties agreed to constitute the tribunal under Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, as follows: the tribunal would be composed of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party, and the third, who would preside over the tribunal, would be jointly selected by the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nOn September 29, 2015, ICSID notified the Parties that Dr. Tawil had accepted his appointment as arbitrator in the proceedings.\n\n14.\n\nOn October 23, 2015, the Respondent appointed Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a national of the French Republic, as arbitrator.

If the ballot process did not result in a mutually agreed selection of one of the proposed candidates, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council would proceed with the appointment of the President of the Tribunal from the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, in consultation with the Parties.\n\n19.\n\nOn August 4, 2016, the Centre provided the Parties with a ballot listing five proposed candidates for the position of President of the Tribunal. On September 5, 2016, each Party submitted its completed ballot to ICSID. On September 6, 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that the ballot process had not resulted in the selection of a mutually agreed candidate.\n\n20.\n\nOn September 23, 2016, the Centre informed the Parties that it intended to propose to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council the appointment of Dr. Eduardo Zuleta Jaramillo, a national of the Republic of Colombia, as third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal, and invited the Parties to submit any comments they may have on this proposal by September 29, 2016.\n\n21.\n\nOn October 17, 2016, the Centre transmitted to the Parties additional information provided by Dr. Zuleta regarding observations submitted by the Parties on September 29 and 30, 2016. Additionally, ICSID informed the Parties that any further observations regarding this proposal should be submitted no later than October 20, 2016, and that, in the absence of such observations, the Centre would proceed with the proposed appointment.\n\n22.\n\nOn October 21, 2016, ICSID informed the Parties that, having received no additional observations regarding the appointment of Dr. Zuleta, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council would proceed with his appointment as President of the Tribunal, in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(1) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n23.\n\nOn October 25, 2016, Dr. Zuleta accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal. On the same date, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties that the three arbitrators had accepted their respective appointments, that the Tribunal had been constituted, and that the proceedings were deemed to have commenced.

Procedural Order No. 1 established, inter alia, that: the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules would be those in effect as of April 10, 2006; Spanish would be the language of the proceedings; and Washington, D.C. would be the seat of the arbitration.

On the same date, the Tribunal Secretary transmitted the translation to the Tribunal and the Parties and, in accordance with the Tribunal's instructions, invited the Parties to submit observations on the European Commission's request. The Parties submitted their observations on November 19, 2018.\n\n50.\n\nOn November 21, 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, granting the European Commission leave to file a submission exclusively on the issue of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, subject to the following conditions; the submission had to be filed in Spanish no later than November 28, 2018; The submission could not exceed 15 pages; and The European Commission had to expressly undertake to bear any costs arising from its intervention. Additionally, the Tribunal denied the European Commission's requests for access to the case file and for leave to appear at the Hearing.\n\n51.\n\nOn November 28, 2018, the European Commission submitted to ICSID a \"*Request for Modification of Procedural Order No. 7, dated November 21, 2018, concerning the European Commission's Request to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party under ICSID Rule 37(2).*\" In this document, the European Commission requested that the Tribunal eliminate the Commission's cost commitment and that, *\"[i]n the event that the Tribunal\u2026 decides not to modify Procedural Order No. 7, the Commission suggests that its request to intervene as a non-disputing party be placed on the record of this case.\"* In accordance with the Tribunal's instructions, ICSID transmitted a copy of this request to the Parties and invited them to submit observations regarding the same.\n\n52.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal Secretary informed the Tribunal that ICSID had received a document titled \"*Amicus Curiae* Submission\" and twelve Exhibits from the European Commission. This documentation was sent exclusively to the ICSID Secretariat without copies to the Members of the Tribunal. In accordance with the Tribunal's instructions, none of these documents were transmitted to the Members of the Tribunal or to the Parties and were retained by the ICSID Secretariat pending further instructions from the Tribunal upon receipt of the Parties' comments.\n\n53.\n\nOn November 30, 2018, the Parties submitted their observations on the European Commission's request for modification.\n\n54.\n\nBy letter dated December 3, 2018, the Tribunal noted that, according to the information provided by the ICSID Secretariat, the *Amicus Curiae* Submission and its Exhibits totaled more than 800 pages. The Tribunal invited the European Commission to limit its submission to 15 pages, excluding the twelve Exhibits, and indicated that, if this condition was met, the Tribunal would reconsider its decision in Procedural Order No. 7 concerning the Commission's cost commitment, based on the following considerations:\n\n\"The Tribunal considers that it is unreasonable to expect the Parties to study and respond to the *Amicus Curiae* Submission and its more than 800 pages of Exhibits in the single week remaining before the hearing. This would place an undue burden on the Parties and unfairly prejudice at least one of them \u2014 the Claimant, which opposed the late intervention \u2014 if not both. Moreover, the intervention would seriously disrupt the proceedings, as even assuming that the Parties could study and comment on the European Commission's *Amicus Curiae* Submission in just one week, it would still require substantial modifications to the hearing structure to allow the Parties sufficient opportunity to debate the submission.\"2\n\nLetter to the European Commission dated December 3, 2018, p. 2.\n\n55.\n\nOn December 4, 2018, the European Commission submitted to ICSID a new 15-page version of its Amicus Curiae Submission, excluding the Exhibits, and requested that the Tribunal reconsider its cost decision in Procedural Order No. 7. On the same date, ICSID transmitted a copy of the Commission's communication to the Tribunal, without attaching the *Amicus Curiae* Submission, pending further instructions.\n\n56.\n\nBy letter dated December 5, 2018, the Tribunal informed the European Commission as follows:\n\n\"Given that the European Commission has limited its submission and removed the Exhibits, thereby substantially reducing the risk of disrupting the proceedings and unduly burdening the Parties, the Tribunal will allow the European Commission's intervention, limited to the 15-page submission mentioned above, and will not require the cost condition set forth in Procedural Order No. 7 for this submission, given its limited scope.\"\n\n57.\n\nOn the same date, in accordance with the Tribunal's instructions, ICSID transmitted the European Commission's communication and *Amicus Curiae* Submission to the Parties and informed them that they could refer to the *Amicus Curiae* submission during the Hearing and that, in any event, the Tribunal would provide the Parties with an opportunity to comment in writing on the European Commission's position after the Hearing.\n\n58.\n\nOn December 5, 2018, the Respondent requested the Tribunal's authorization to submit into the record the \"*Decision on Liability and on Principles for Quantum Assessment*\" dated November 30, 2018, issued in the arbitration *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.)

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal presents below a summary of the most relevant facts of the dispute, whether agreed upon, undisputed, or determined by the Tribunal.\n\n106.\n\nThis dispute concerns certain measures adopted by the Respondent in the renewable energy sector (\"**RE Sector**\") and the alleged breaches of its obligations under the ECT regarding the Claimant's investments.3\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 91 and 100.\n\n107.\n\nConcentrated Solar Power (\"**CSP**\") technology is a form of solar thermal technology where solar energy is captured in a liquid carrier fluid, which is used to heat thermal oil as a heat transfer fluid (\"**HTF**\") inside absorption tubes. The HTF converts water into steam using a steam generator, or alternatively, the heat is transferred to a thermal storage system for later use. The generated steam then drives a turbine, which is in turn connected to a generator that produces electricity. The Arenales Plant uses a parabolic trough design, where solar radiation is concentrated on receivers through mirrors or parabolic-trough collectors.4\n\nEstudio Cuatrecasas, Gon\u00e7alves Pereira. Legal Audit Report: Proyecto Termosolar Arenales Solar PS, S.L., Cuatrecasas, Gon\u00e7alves Pereira S.L.P., July 26, 2011 [**C-0017**].\n\n108.\n\nBy using natural gas, CSP plants increase their conversion efficiency from solar energy to electricity and enhance the reliability of their production.\n\n109.\n\nSince the Spanish Constitution of 1978, the Kingdom of Spain has adopted a set of laws governing the Spanish Electricity System (\"**SEE**\"). The SEE consists of electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and supply, along with electricity consumers and various State regulatory authorities.5\n\nRenewable Energy Plan in Spain 2005-2010, Council of Ministers, August 2005 (**\"Plan 2005-2010\"**) [**CL-0016; R-0101**].\n\n110.\n\nOn November 27, 1997, Spain enacted Law 54/1997,6 which partially opened the electricity sector to competition (with both regulated and liberalized activities) and ended the traditional State-owned public service model. This law established the general legal framework for the electricity sector in Spain, including its guiding principles.\n\nLaw 54/1997, dated November 27, 1997, on the Electricity Sector (**\"Law 54/1997\"** or **\"1997 LSE\") [CL-0008; R-0003**].\n\n111.\n\nLaw 54/1997 distinguished between an \"*Ordinary Regime*\", applicable to conventional energy production sources (such as coal-fired power plants), and a \"*Special Regime*\", designed to promote electricity generation from renewable energy sources through various means. The Special Regime applied to electricity production facilities under 50MW that generated electricity from non-consumable renewable energy sources.7\n\nArticle 27(1) of Law 54/1997 [**CL-0008; R-0003**].\n\n112.\n\nThe law specified that electricity production, except for production under the Special Regime, was considered a liberalized activity.8\n\nPreamble of Law 54/1997 **[CL-0008; R-0003]**.\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent states that this dual regime for electricity generation was intended to promote energy production from sources whose \"*competitive market prices were insufficient to cover their construction and operating costs while ensuring a reasonable return on investment. For this reason, such projects required subsidies to be profitable*.\"9 The Parties do not dispute that, due to the high investment costs, CSP energy generation projects required economic incentives recognized by the Government to compete on cost terms with conventional energy projects.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 293 (emphasis omitted).\n\n114.\n\nThe application of the Special Regime was subject to compliance with a series of requirements set forth in the legal and regulatory provisions applicable to the SEE.\n\n115.\n\nLaw 54/1997 also provided for a \"*reasonable rate of return*\" for energy producers. In this regard, Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 established the following:\n\n\"For the determination of premiums, consideration shall be given to the voltage level of energy delivery to the grid, the effective contribution to environmental improvement, primary energy savings, energy efficiency, and the investment costs incurred, in order to achieve reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market.\"10\n\nArticle 30(4) of Law 54/1997 [**CL-0008; R-0003**].\n\n116.\n\nOn December 30, 1997, Spain adopted the 2000-2010 Renewable Energy Promotion Plan.11 This Plan assessed the costs that the SEE would incur due to the deployment of renewable energies, based on the reasonable return expected to be granted, and analyzed whether these costs were sustainable for the SEE under a predictable energy scenario.\n\nSpain's 2000-2010 Renewable Energy Promotion Plan, dated December 19, 1999 [**R-0100**].\n\n117.\n\nAs the first regulatory development of Law 54/1997, Spain enacted Royal Decree (\"**RD**\") 2818/199812 on the production of electricity by facilities powered by renewable energy sources, waste, and cogeneration. RD 2818/1998 aimed to establish *\"a system of temporary incentives for those facilities that require them to compete in a free market\";* to achieve this objective, it determined *\"a premium for facilities larger than 50 MW that use non-consumable and non-hydraulic renewable energy sources, biomass, biofuels, or agricultural, livestock, or service waste, in accordance with the provisions of Article 30.5 of the Electricity Sector Law*.\"13 The regulation allowed for the periodic review and updating of tariffs and premiums applicable to renewable energy (\"**RE**\") producers.14 Article 32 of this regulation, under the heading \"*modifications of premiums and prices*\", provided for premium reviews every four years.\n\nRoyal Decree 2818/1998, of December 23, 1998, on the production of electricity by facilities supplied by renewable energy resources or sources, waste, and cogeneration (\"**RD 2818/1998\") [R-0080**]; Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 306; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 710-712.\n\nRD 2818/1998, art. 1 [**R-0080**].\n\nRD 2818/1998, art. 32 [**R-0080**].\n\n118.\n\nThe promotion and development of renewable energy also constitute an important objective for the European Union (\"**EU**\"). The EU's targets and objectives were established by reference to the global goals agreed upon in the Kyoto Protocol. In turn, in applying the EU's objectives, \"*and to fulfill its own objectives and interests, Spain adopted measures to promote renewable energy*.\"15\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 28.

To achieve this goal, it introduced the following adjustments: ***(i)*** updating, systematizing, and redefining the regulatory provisions issued under Law 54/1997; ***(ii)*** establishing a long-term economic regime for facilities under the special regime, based on an objective and transparent remuneration calculation methodology; ***(iii)*** introducing transitional economic regimes for facilities subject to RD 2366/1994 and RD 2818/1998; ***(iv)*** determining an additional premium for facilities larger than 50 MW, in accordance with Article 30(5) of Law 54/1997; and ***(v)*** allowing producers under the Special Regime to sell the electricity produced, either at a fixed regulated tariff or at market price plus a premium per unit of electricity.26\n\nRoyal Decree 436/2004, of December 27, 2002, establishing the methodology for updating and systematizing the legal and economic regime for electricity production under the special regime (\"**RD 436/2004**\") [**CL-0015; R-0082**]; Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 307-310.\n\nRD 436/2004, art. 18 [**CL-0015**; **R-0082**].\n\n123.\n\nRD 436/2004 established the periodic review and modification of tariffs, premiums, and incentives.27 Additionally, the revised tariffs, premiums, incentives, and supplements resulting from these reviews would apply to facilities that began operating after the corresponding modifications took effect.28\n\nRD 436/2004, art. 40 [**CL-0015**; **R-0082**].\n\nRD 436/2004, art. 40 [**CL-0015**; **R-0082**].\n\n124.\n\nOn August 26, 2005, the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving (\"**IDAE**\"), an advisory body of the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and Trade (the \"**Ministry**\"), proposed a series of recommendations to foster investment growth in the renewable energy (\"**RE**\") sector in Spain. These recommendations were incorporated and approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers in the Renewable Energy Promotion Plan in Spain 2005-2010 (the \"**2005-2010 Plan**\").29\n\nPlan 2005-2010, Introduction [**CL-0016**; **R-0101**].\n\n125.\n\nIn Chapter 3.4, the 2005-2010 Plan summarizes what thermoelectric energy is and provides an assessment of how this type of energy operates in other parts of the world.30 The 2005-2010 Plan also analyzed RD 436/2004 and concluded that it proposed a sufficiently favorable economic framework for the development of the solar thermal sector, but it limited remuneration conditions by setting a maximum of 200 MW.31 The Plan explicitly recognized that, due to the low profitability of these technologies, higher premiums were necessary to ensure project sustainability.32 It then identified a series of economic, technological, and regulatory barriers to the development of thermoelectric projects, including: the need for investment assistance or subsidies for the first projects, limited regulation for thermoelectric plants, and restrictions on current premiums and tariffs for plants within the 200 MW threshold.33\n\nPlan 2005-2010, Introduction, pp. 131, 132 [**CL-0016**; **R-0101**].\n\nPlan 2005-2010, Introduction, p. 138 [**CL-0016**; **R-0101**].\n\nPlan 2005-2010, Introduction, p. 139 [**CL-0016**; **R-0101**].\n\nPlan 2005-2010, Introduction, p. 143 [**CL-0016**; **R-0101**].\n\n126.\n\nOn June 23, 2006, Spain issued Royal Decree-Law (\"**RDL**\") 7/2006,34 \"*adopting urgent measures in the energy sector*,\" which amended certain provisions of Law 54/1997. RDL 7/2006 amended Article 30 of Law 54/1997 to grant \"*priority access to transmission and distribution networks*\" to energy generated by producers under the Special Regime.35 However, this priority access was subject to \"*maintaining the reliability and security of the networks*.\"36 In its Second Transitional Provision, RDL 7/2006 specified that until regulatory development of Sections 1 to 12 of Article 1 was completed, the Government's review of the average tariff would not apply to the prices, premiums, incentives, and tariffs granted to RE producers under the Special Regime.\n\nRDL 7/2006 [**R-0071**].\n\nRDL 7/2006, art. 1 [**R-0071**].\n\nRDL 7/2006, art. 1 [**R-0071**].\n\n127.\n\nOn May 25, 2007, Spain issued RD 661/2007,37 which responded to the need to modify the remuneration scheme available to producers under the Special Regime. RD 661/2007 also aimed to decouple this remuneration from the reference electricity tariff used up to that point, as well as to regulate certain technical aspects and thereby contribute to the growth of RE technologies.\n\nRoyal Decree 661/2007, of May 25, 2007, regulating electricity production activity under the special regime (\"**RD 661/2007**\") [**CL-0018; R-0084**]; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 409; Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 317-321; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 714, 715.\n\n128.\n\nRD 661/2007 repealed RD 436/2004. Among its objectives was \"*the establishment of a legal and economic regime for the production of electricity under the special regime*.\"38 To achieve this, it modified the economic and legal framework that had previously governed the Special Regime. The reasons for this change are explained in the Preamble of RD.39\n\nRD 661/2007, art. 1, *lit.* a [**CL-0018; R-0084**].\n\nRD 661/2007, Preamble [**CL-0018; R-0084**].\n\n129.\n\nThe first reason was the growth of the special regime in recent years, along with the need to regulate certain technical aspects to support the growth of these technologies while safeguarding the security of the electricity system and ensuring the quality of supply. Another reason was the need to minimize production constraints for this type of generation: The economic regime established in RD 436/2004 did not account for certain variables in recent market price behavior, which have become more relevant in the remuneration framework for the Special Regime.40 For this reason, states the Preamble, it became necessary to modify the remuneration scheme, detaching it from the Average or Reference Electricity Tariff, which had been used until then.41\n\nRD 661/2007, Preamble [**CL-0018; R-0084**].\n\nRD 661/2007, Preamble [**CL-0018; R-0084**].\n\n130.\n\nArticle 2 of RD 661/2007 provided that the Special Regime would apply to \"*facilities that use as their primary energy source non-consumable renewable energies, biomass, or any type of biofuel, as long as their owner does not engage in production activities under the ordinary regime*.\"\n\n131.\n\nRD 661/2007 established a system in which producers under the Special Regime could: ***(a)*** sell electricity to the system through the transmission or distribution network, receiving a regulated tariff, uniform for all scheduling periods, expressed in euro cents per kilowatt-hour (\"**Fixed Tariff**\"); or ***(b)*** sell electricity in the electricity production market, in which case the sale price of electricity would be the price resulting from the organized market or the freely negotiated price set by the facility owner or representative, supplemented, where applicable, by a premium in euro cents per kilowatt-hour (\"**Premium**\").42 The choice between these two tariff options (**Feed-in Tariffs, \"FIT\"**) applied for one-year periods. For technologies such as CSP, the Premium option was subject to upper and lower thresholds.\n\nRD 661/2007, art. 31 [**CL-0018**; **R-0084**].\n\n132.\n\nAdditionally, RD 661/2007 had the following features:\n\na. Article 14 established that the final registration of the facility in the Administrative Registry of Electricity Production Facilities under the Special Regime (**RAIPRE**), administered by the Ministry, was a mandatory requirement for the facility to benefit from the Special Regime under RD 661/2007.\n\nb. Article 17(e) granted priority access and connection to the electricity network for RE producers over conventional energy producers, pursuant to the terms set out in Exhibit XI of RD 661/2007.\n\nc. Article 2(1)(b) allowed RE production facilities under the Special Regime to use fuels for electricity generation, provided that the electricity generated by these fuels did not exceed 12% of total production if the facility sold energy under the Fixed Tariff option, or 15% if it sold energy under the Premium option.\n\nd. Article 22 stated that tariffs and premiums established in RD 661/2007 could be reviewed if Spain reached certain installed RE capacity thresholds, but such a review would not apply to facilities already registered in RAIPRE before that date.\n\ne. Article 36 established fixed tariffs and premiums, which would be applicable throughout the entire operational life of each facility.\n\nf. Article 44(1) provided that tariffs, premiums, and upper and lower limits would be adjusted based on fuel price indices and the Consumer Price Index (\"**CPI**\").\n\n133.\n\nUnder Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007:\n\n\"During the year 2010, based on the results of monitoring reports on compliance with the [2005-2010 Plan] and the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), as well as new objectives included in the next Renewable Energy Plan for the 2011-2020 period, the revision of tariffs, premiums, supplements, and upper and lower limits defined in this royal decree will be carried out, taking into account the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the special regime in meeting demand, and its impact on the technical and economic management of the system, always ensuring reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of capital in the market. Every four years thereafter, a new review will be conducted maintaining the same criteria. The reviews referenced in this section regarding the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits will not affect facilities whose commissioning certificate was issued before January 1 of the second year following the year in which the review was conducted.\"\n\n134.\n\nOn the same day that Spain adopted RD 661/2007, the Ministry of Industry, Energy, and Tourism issued a press release,43 in which it identified the purpose and elements of the new RD under the headline: *\"The Government prioritizes profitability and stability in the new Royal Decree on renewable energy and cogeneration \u2013 Government commitment to clean and domestic energy sources.\"*\n\nPress Release from the Ministry of Industry, Energy, and Tourism, May 25, 2007 [**CL-0019**]; Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 378; Memorial of Claim. \u00b6\u00b6 39-43.\n\n135.\n\nOn April 23, 2009, the European Parliament and Council approved Directive 2009/28/EC44 (\"**EU Directive 2009**\"), \" *on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC*.\" The Directive reaffirmed the EU's commitment to promoting renewable energy45 and sets a target for the EU to obtain 20% of its total energy consumption requirements from renewable energy sources by the year 2020.46\n\nDirective 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 23, 2009, on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC, published in the Official Journal of the European Union on June 5, 2009 **[RL-0017]**.\n\nDirective 2009/28/EC, Preamble, \u00b6 1 **[RL-0017]**.\n\nDirective 2009/28/EC, Preamble, \u00b6 8 **[RL-0017]**.\n\n136.\n\nOn April 30, 2009, RDL 6/2009 was approved.47 The Preamble mentions the growing tariff deficit and states that the misalignment between tariffs and revenues affected the ability to finance the investments necessary to ensure the electricity supply for Spanish society. RDL 6/2009 adopted various measures aimed at \"*protecting consumers and ensuring the economic sustainability of the electricity system [\u2026] [and] reactivating and boosting investments in the energy sector*,\"48 it established maximum tariff deficit limits for the years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 and stipulated that the tariff deficit should be eliminated no later than 2013.49\n\nRoyal Decree-Law 6/2009, of April 30, 2009, adopting certain measures in the energy sector and approving the social bonus (\"**RDL 6/2009**\") [**CL-0020**]; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 482, 483; Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 326, 327; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 811.\n\nRDL 6/2009, Preamble **[CL-0020; R-0072]**.\n\nRDL 6/2009, art. 1 [**CL-0020**; **R-0072**].\n\n137.\n\nRDL 6/2009 introduced a new registration process, requiring RE facilities to be registered in the Administrative Register of Remuneration Pre-Assignment before registering in RAIPRE.50 This was a mandatory requirement to receive the benefits granted under the Special Regime. After obtaining registration in the Remuneration Pre-Assignment Register, the plant had a maximum period of 36 months to obtain final registration in RAIPRE in order to benefit from the economic regime of RD 661/2007.51\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 486-489.\n\nRDL 6/2009, art. 4, sec. 1 **[CL-0020; R-0072]**.\n\n138.\n\nOn December 11, 2009, Arenales Solar registered in Phase 3 of the Pre-Assignment Register.52 Phase 3 of the Pre-Assignment Register required that the Plant be registered in RAIPRE before January 1, 2013.

The new law created the Tax on the Value of Electricity Production (the \"**TVPEE**\") on total revenues from the production and injection of electricity into the national grid. The TVPEE, amounting to 7% of this revenue, applied to all energy producers, both conventional and renewable, including those subject to the Special Regime.84\n\nLaw 15/2012, of December 27, 2012, on fiscal measures for energy sustainability (\"**Law 15/2012\") [CL-0024**]; Memorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 997-1000.\n\nLaw 15/2012, arts. 1-8 [**CL-0024**].\n\n153.\n\nThe first final provision of Law 15/2012 introduced modifications to Law 54/1997. In particular, it amended paragraph 2 of Article 15 of Law 54/1997:\n\n\"The costs of regulated activities, including the permanent system operation costs and the costs of diversification and security of supply, shall be financed through revenues collected from access tolls to transmission and distribution networks paid by consumers and producers, as well as from allocations from the General State Budget.\"85\n\nLaw 15/2012, Final Provision One [**CL-0024**].\n\n154.\n\nLaw 15/2012 also added paragraph 7 to Article 30 of Law 54/1997:\n\n\"Electricity attributable to the use of fuel in a generation facility that uses as primary energy a non-consumable renewable energy source shall not be eligible for the regulated economic regime, except in the case of hybrid installations combining non-consumable and consumable renewable energy sources, in which case the electricity attributable to the use of the consumable renewable energy source may be eligible for the regulated economic regime [\u2026].\"86\n\nLaw 15/2012, Final Provision One [**CL-0024**].\n\n155.\n\nOn February 1, 2013, Spain enacted Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 on urgent measures in the electricity system and financial sector.87 Pursuant to Article 1, effective January 1, 2013, all electricity system payments, tariffs, and premiums that were previously updated according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) \u2014 including those applicable to producers under the Special Regime \u2014 would now be updated according to the CPI at constant taxes, excluding unprocessed food and energy products.88\n\nRoyal Decree-Law 2/2013, of February 1, 2013, on urgent measures in the electricity system and the financial sector (\"**RDL 2/2013**\") [**CL-0025**; **R-0077**].\n\nRDL 2/2013, art. 1 [**CL-0025**; **R-0077**].\n\n156.\n\nUnder Article 2 of Royal Decree-Law 2/2013, when producers under the Special Regime opted for a remuneration scheme based on the market price plus a premium, this premium would be reduced to EUR 0.0 cents/kWh for both existing and future installations.\n\n157.\n\nOn July 12, 2013, Spain issued RDL 9/2013,89 which amended Law 54/1997. Specifically, Article 1 of Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 modified Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 as follows:\n\n\"4: Additionally, and under terms to be determined by royal decree of the Council of Ministers, in addition to remuneration for the sale of generated electricity valued at the market price, installations may receive a specific remuneration [the Special Payment] consisting of a term per unit of installed capacity, which will cover, where applicable, the investment costs of a standard installation that cannot be recovered through the sale of electricity, and an operational term that will cover, where applicable, the difference between operating costs and revenues from market participation of the standard installation.\n\nFor the calculation of this specific remuneration, the following will be considered for a standard installation throughout its regulatory useful life and in reference to the activity performed by an efficient and well-managed company:\n\na. Standard revenues from the sale of generated electricity valued at the market price.\n\nb. Standard operating costs.\n\nc. The standard value of the initial investment. [\u2026]\n\nThis remuneration regime shall not exceed the minimum level necessary to cover costs that allow installations to compete on equal terms with other technologies in the market and to enable them to obtain a reasonable return based on the standard installation applicable in each case. [\u2026]\n\nThis reasonable return shall be, before taxes, based on the average return in the secondary market of ten-year Spanish government bonds, applying the appropriate differential.\n\nThe parameters of the remuneration regime may be reviewed every six years.\"\n\nRoyal Decree-Law 9/2013, of July 12, 2013, adopting urgent measures to ensure the financial stability of the electricity system (\"**RDL 9/2013**\") [**CL-0026**]; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1029-1031.\n\n158.\n\nOn December 26, 2013, the Respondent enacted Law 24/2013,90 which replaced Law 54/1997.\n\nLaw 24/2013, of December 26, 2013, on the Electricity Sector (\"**Law 24/2013**\") [**CL-0009**].\n\n159.\n\nThe regime created by Law 24/2013 formally eliminated the distinction between the Ordinary Regime and the Special Regime.91 Both conventional and renewable energy producers were now subject to the same conditions, with the latter having only the right to the Special Payment created by RDL 9/2013.92 Law 24/2013 also eliminated the priority right of access to the grid and the priority of dispatch for RE installations.93 When RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013 were adopted, Spain had not yet implemented a comprehensive regulatory and economic framework for RE installations.94 For the following months, the Fixed Tariff continued to apply (although not the Premium, which had been eliminated by RDL 2/2013).\n\nLaw 24/2013, Preamble [**CL-0009**].\n\nLaw 24/2013, Preamble [**CL-0009**]\n\nLaw 24/2013, art. 26(1) [**CL-0009**].\n\nLaw 24/2013, Final Provision Three [**CL-0009**].\n\n160.\n\nOn June 6, 2014, with the enactment of Royal Decree 413/2014,95 Spain began implementing Law 24/2013, which regulated the activity of electricity production from renewable energy sources, cogeneration, and waste. However, Royal Decree 413/2014 did not establish compensation parameters for Standard Installations.\n\nRoyal Decree 413/2014, of June 6, 2014, regulating the activity of electricity production from renewable energy sources, cogeneration, and waste (\"**RD 413/2014**\") [**CL-0027**].\n\n161.\n\nOn June 20, 2014, Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 was published in the Official State Gazette, *\"approving the remuneration parameters for standard installations applicable to certain electricity production facilities from renewable energy sources, cogeneration, and waste*.*\"*96 As a second measure implementing Law 24/2013, the Ministerial Order established the remuneration parameters applicable to renewable energy producers under the framework of Law 24/2013. According to Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, the reasonable rate of return applicable to installations existing before the entry into force of RDL 9/2013 was set at 7.398%.\n\nMinisterial Order IET/1045/2014, of June 16, 2014, approving the remuneration parameters for standard installations applicable to certain electricity production installations from renewable energy sources, cogeneration, and waste (\"**Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014**\") [**CL-0028**].\n\n162.\n\nUnder the new regime applicable to RE installations, including the Arenales Plant, RE producers were entitled to receive a Special Payment in addition to the market price of the electricity they produced. CSP installations were entitled to the Special Payment only for a regulatory useful life of twenty-five years, rather than for the entirety of their operational life. Additionally, the Special Payment was calculated by reference to a standard installation. Costs incurred and investments made due to local laws or regulations were not taken into account. Finally, the Special Payment could exceed the minimum necessary to allow RE producers to obtain a reasonable return, calculated at 7.398% for existing installations.\n\n163.\n\nAs a consequence of the foregoing, the Claimant asserts that the regulatory framework applicable to the Arenales Plant has changed significantly since Steag made its investment. The measures have altered the regulatory framework in a manner that, according to the Claimant, is inconsistent with the previous system, as the remuneration has shifted from a fixed tariff or a premium granted per MWh produced to a system of *\"*ratios*\"* based on standard installations.97\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 523.\n\n164.\n\nIn February 2020, Steag carried out a divestment transaction through which it sold its stake in Arenales Solar to RREEF.98 According to the Claimant, the stake was sold for a sum of EUR 9,422,027.99\n\nCommunication regarding the transfer of STEAG GmbH's position in Arenales Solar PS, S.L. to Fronterasol, B.V., February 4, 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\nResponse to Spain's comments on the Fronterasol and Steag transaction in Arenales Solar PS, S.L., February 20, 2020, \u00b6 4.\n\n**VI.

The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear a dispute between an investor from an EU Member State and an EU Member State (\"**intra-EU dispute**\") regarding an investment made by the former in the territory of the latter (\"**intra-EU investment**\").\n\nb. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claim concerning the alleged breach of Article 10(1) due to the introduction of the TVPEE through Law 15/2012 of December 27, 2012.103 By operation of Article 21 of the ECT, Article 10(1) of the ECT does not give rise to obligations concerning \"tax measures,\" meaning that Spain has not consented to arbitration over the dispute.104\n\nc. The Tribunal lacks *Ratione Temporis* Jurisdiction. The Claimant made its investment after the dispute arose, when the measures at issue had already been implemented or announced.105\n\nd. The claim concerning the alleged violation of Article 13 of the ECT (expropriation) due to the introduction of the TVPEE is inadmissible; Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT requires that the matter be initially submitted to Spain's competent tax authorities, which must issue a decision within six (6) months.106\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 110-203; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 8 and 206-290.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 5; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 8.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 840-842; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 10 and 311-335.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 204-223; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 9 and 291-310.\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimant has presented its arguments against the jurisdictional and admissibility objections in its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, dated May 11, 2018,107 and in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, dated October 31, 2018.108\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 18 et seq.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1 et seq.\n\n**A. The Intra-EU Objection**\n-----------------------------\n\n1. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThe Kingdom of Spain argues that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear a dispute between an EU Member State and an investor from another EU Member State (\"**intra-EU**\" dispute), especially when the dispute requires the interpretation and application of EU law, including the rules governing State aid.109 Spain raises its intra-EU objection as a challenge to both the Tribunal's *ratione personae* jurisdiction,110 and its *ratione materiae* jurisdiction.111\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 57 et seq. and 84-93; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 73 et seq.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 57 et seq.; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 73 et seq.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 84-205.\n\n1.1. *Ratione personae* jurisdiction\n------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks ratione personae jurisdiction to hear the dispute112 because Article 26 of the ECT covers only disputes between \"*a Contracting Party*\" and \"*an investor of another Contracting Party*.\"113 From this, Spain concludes that the ECT's dispute resolution mechanism does not apply to an intra-EU dispute concerning an intra-EU investment.114 Spain emphasizes that its position is consistent with the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"**CJEU**\") ruling in *Achmea,*115 and stresses that a CJEU judgment constitutes law.116 In this regard, the Respondent draws the Tribunal's attention to the Svea Court of Appeal's decision in *Novenergia II.*117 Additionally, the Respondent asserts that Steag was aware of \"*the issues posed by intra-EU arbitrations*\" at least since 2014.118\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 57 et seq.; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 73 et seq.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 58.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 58.

Claimant's Position\n----------------------\n\n199.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the objection regarding intra-EU jurisdiction is unfounded.222 Steag categorizes the Respondent's arguments into two categories.223 The first relates to the literal wording of the ECT's dispute resolution clauses; the second concerns the relationship and alleged conflict between the ECT and EU law.224 Additionally, Steag analyzes the potential relevance of the CJEU's decision in the *Achmea* case225 and presents five main arguments against Spain's intra-EU objection.226\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 18 et seq.; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 2-5 and 11 et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 21.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 21.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 22; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 103 et seq.\n\nSee Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 18 et seq. and 41 et seq.; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 11 and 16-141.\n\n200.\n\nA **first argument** is that the Respondent has unsuccessfully raised the same objection in other arbitration proceedings.227 Even in the *Novenergia II v. Spain* case, the tribunal rejected Spain's request to reopen the case in view of the CJEU decision in *Achmea.228* The objection has also failed in arbitrations against other EU Member States.229 The Claimant challenges the idea that *Electrabel v. Hungary* supports the Respondent's interpretation of Article 26(6) of the ECT, pointing out that the tribunal in that case concluded there was no incompatibility between EU law and the ECT.230 For Steag, the relevant awards allow the following conclusions:231 ***(a)*** the EU's membership in the ECT does not exclude the right of EU Member States to be sued by investors from other EU Member States; ***(b)*** the ECT does not contain the concept of an \"*EU investor*\"; ***(c)*** since the ECT does not explicitly or implicitly include a \"*disconnection clause*,\" nothing prevents an EU investor from initiating arbitration against an EU Member State; ***(d)*** there is no conflict between the ECT and EU law; and ***(e)*** the EU was a driving force behind the ECT, and the ECT was ratified after the entry into force of the Treaty of Rome, which allows for the presumption that the ECT was designed to be compatible with EU law.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 19 and 27 et seq. In particular, in \u00b6\u00b6 27-30 of its Memorial, the Claimant cites the cases: *Charanne BV et al. v.

Steag (\u00b6\u00b6 37-38) cites the cases *AES Summit Generation Ltd. et al. v. Hungary*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22 (September 23, 2010), \u00b6 6.1.4 [**RL-0039**] and *Blusun S.A. et al. v. Republic of Italy*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3 (December 27, 2016), \u00b6\u00b6 280-284 [**RL-0068**]. In these cases, the applicable treaty was the ECT (\u00b6\u00b6 37, 38). Later, the Claimant (\u00b6 39) refers to the cases *Eastern Sugar B.V. (Netherlands) v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award, SCC Case No. 088/2004 (March 27, 2007), \u00b6\u00b6 168, 172 [**CL-0071**]; *Binder v.

Meanwhile, the ECT's dispute resolution mechanism is intended to ensure the effectiveness of the protection granted by the ECT to foreign investors.242\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 89.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 76, 89.

The Claimant also cites doctrinal writings [**CL-0134**] and a report from the Spanish Council of State on the incorporation of European law into the Spanish legal system, dated February 14, 2008 [**CL-0135**].\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31.\n\n206.\n\nRegarding the arbitral tribunal's decision in the *Vattenfall* case, which classified EU law as part of Public International Law,251 Steag argues that if this Tribunal were to adopt the same conclusion and find a conflict between EU law and the ECT, it would be necessary to analyze Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT.252\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 33, referring to the case *Vattenfall AB et al. v. Federal Republic of Germany*, Decision on the *Achmea* Issue, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12 (August 31, 2018), \u00b6 150 [**CL-0131**].\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 96, 97; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 34 and 39-44.\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the ECT remains an international treaty in force between Germany and Spain.253 Regarding Article 59 of the VCLT, Steag highlights that only some Contracting Parties to the ECT are EU members, which seems to preclude the application of Article 59.254 Furthermore, the Maastricht Treaty and the ECT regulate completely different matters, which eliminates the conditions set out in Article 59(1)(b) of the VCLT.255 As for the potential effect of the 2007 Lisbon Treaty, the Claimant points out that it was not signed by all Contracting Parties to the ECT and pursued objectives that went beyond the ECT. Thus, it cannot be said that the Lisbon Treaty rendered the ECT obsolete or no longer in force.256 The Claimant finds that Spain has not demonstrated that EU Member States intended for there to be an incompatibility between EU agreements and the ECT.257\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 96, 97; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 48, 60, and 84, citing Article 42 of the VCLT and noting that the ECT has not been denounced by Germany or Spain under Article 47 of the ECT.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 97, 98.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 41.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 43.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 98.\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimant explains that Article 30(3) of the VCLT does not apply because the parties to the prior and subsequent treaties do not coincide in relation to the ECT, TEU, and TFEU.258 Article 30(3) of the VCLT conditions the application of provisions in a prior treaty on their compatibility with a subsequent treaty.259 Additionally, since this Tribunal is not required to analyze or interpret EU law, the incompatibility referred to in Article 30(3) does not arise.260 In any case, applying Article 30(3) of the VCLT would not lead to the conclusion that EU law prevails over the ECT, as the Respondent suggests,261 given that the ECT was adopted after the Founding Treaties of the European Communities.262\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 44.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 99; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 42 and 44.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 100, 101.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 37.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 38 et seq. and 42.\n\n209.\n\nThe Claimant also considers unsustainable the argument that the ECT was modified by the treaties that established the European Union.263 In this context, the *lex posterior* rule cannot apply: the articles allegedly incompatible with the ECT (Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU) were also part of the Treaty Establishing the European Community.264 Steag also rejects the notion that Spain and Germany modified the ECT \" *inter se*\" (Article 41(1) of the VCLT), to exclude arbitration involving their nationals.265 That possibility is precluded by Article 16 of the ECT, which applies as *lex specialis.266*\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 47.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 47.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 47.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 47.\n\n210.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that even if a conflict between EU law and the ECT were found, the applicable conflict rule is Article 16 of the ECT, which requires applying the provisions that are more favorable to investment or investors.267 Although Spain has argued that the EU legal system provides a \"*similar level of protection*\" to that offered by the ECT, it fails to provide a solid argument and ignores the absence of investor-State arbitration in EU law.268 The ECT's dispute resolution clause, combined with the broad protection of legitimate expectations under the FET standard and the umbrella clause in Article 10(1) of the ECT, undermine the alleged superiority of the guarantees offered by EU law.269 In the event of a conflict, the ECT must prevail in accordance with Article 16 of the ECT.270 Therefore, since no conflict exists between the ECT and EU law, this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute.271\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 102. In support of its conclusion regarding Article 16 of the ECT, the Claimant (\u00b6\u00b6 104, 105) cites the cases *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Ltd. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Decision on Jurisdiction, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30 (June 6, 2016), \u00b6 87 [**CL-0030**] and *Eiser Infrastructure Ltd*. *et al. v.

Spain*,*280* the Claimant concludes that Article 26 of the ECT must be understood to allow an intra-EU investor to access its dispute resolution mechanism.281\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 77. The Claimant also highlights that even EU citizenship depends on the nationality of a Member State under Article 20.1 of the TFEU (\u00b6 75).\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 49, citing *Eiser Infrastructure Ltd. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36 (May 4, 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 195, 196 [**CL-0003**]. In support of its argument, the Claimant (\u00b6 50) also cites the award in the case *Novenergia II - Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), SICAR v. Kingdom of Spain*, Final Award, SCC Case No. 2015/063 (February 15, 2018), \u00b6 453 [**CL-0069**].\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 51.\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimant considers that the Respondent's argument assumes that the ECT contains an implicit disconnection clause, which would exclude intra-EU arbitration.282 Steag notes that the ECT contains some explicit disconnection clauses283 and that other treaties drafted with EU participation also contain such clauses.284 It follows that, if the intention had been to exclude intra-EU disputes from the scope of application of the ECT, an explicit clause to that effect would have been introduced.285 The Claimant maintains that multiple arbitral decisions have confirmed the interpretation of the ECT.286 Given the above, an interpretation of the ECT in line with the principles of good faith and *pacta sunt servanda* precludes the conclusion that the treaty includes an implicit disconnection clause.287\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 52.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 56.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 57.

In this context, the Claimant specifically refers to the cases *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Ltd. et al. v.

Spain*, the tribunal dismissed Spain's arguments regarding Article 26(6) of the ECT as a provision recognizing the primacy of EU law.290\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 84 et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 72.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 73.\n\n216.\n\nRegarding whether EU law qualifies as Public International Law for the purposes of Article 26 of the ECT, the Claimant reiterates that from a theoretical standpoint, there are two possible perspectives: one option is to consider international law and EU law as elements of a common legal order (monist perspective), while the other is to classify them as distinct legal systems (dualist perspective).291 The Claimant asserts that, while EU law could initially be classified within Public International Law, it has since evolved into an \"*autonomous and self-contained legal system*.\"292\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 76.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 74, 75.\n\n217.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal's jurisdiction derives from the ECT, not from EU law.293 The sole sources of this Tribunal's jurisdiction are Article 26 of the ECT and the ICSID Convention.294 A literal interpretation of Article 26(6) of the ECT, in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, indicates that the \"*applicable rules of international law*\" refer to the substantive rules governing the dispute. Consequently, even if EU law is considered Public International Law, it does not apply to this Tribunal's jurisdiction.295\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 80. In support of this statement, Steag (\u00b6 80) cites the case *Eiser Infrastructure Ltd. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36 (May 4, 2017), \u00b6 199 [**CL-0003**].\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 87, 88.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 87-93.\n\n218.\n\nWith regard to Spain's argument that EU law should apply under the \"*proximity principle*\" of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT,296 Steag finds that this argument does not justify applying Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU or the *Achmea* case to this arbitration.297 The CJEU's decision in Achmea adopts a dualist view of EU law, treating it as autonomous from Public International Law.298 This dualism contradicts the premise of applying Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, which concerns the relationship between different provisions of international law, particularly the interaction between treaties and customary international law.299 In Steag's view, Spain has not demonstrated that the requirements for applying Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT are met in this case.300 No applicable rule of international law requires that Article 26 of the ECT be interpreted in light of Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU.301\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 106.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 106.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 107. According to Steag, this is why the *Achmea* case is often linked to the *Kadi* case, in which the CJEU paved the way for its current dualist stance (\u00b6\u00b6 106, 107). The Claimant here refers to the decision of the Seventh Chamber of the General Court of the EU in the case *Yassin Abdullah Kadi v. European Commission*, Judgment, Case T-85/09 (September 30, 2010), \u00b6 285 [**CL-0082**].\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 108, 109.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 109, 110.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 111, referring to the case *Vattenfall AB et al. v.

In support of its conclusion, Steag (\u00b6 70) refers to the case *Charanne BV et al. v. Kingdom of Spain, Award*, SCC Case No. V 062/2012 (January 21, 2016), \u00b6 448 [**CL-0029**].\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 71.\n\n222.\n\nSteag asserts that since it is not necessary to apply EU law, the relationship between EU law and Public International Law is irrelevant to this case.315\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 82.\n\n223.\n\nFinally, the **fifth argument** specifically concerns the issue of State aid.316 The Claimant stresses that the core issue of the dispute is whether Spain frustrated Steag's legitimate expectations under Article 10(1) of the ECT and whether an expropriation occurred \u2014 not whether the Original Regulatory Regime (\"**RRO**\") constituted State aid.317 The Claimant argues that the question of whether the RRO qualified as State aid is irrelevant to the arbitration and does not impact the claims presented.318 While Steag acknowledges that in this arbitration, the Tribunal may determine compensation amounts by considering the cash flows that would have been generated under the RRO, it has not requested a ruling declaring a right to receive such cash flows indefinitely.319\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 62, 63 and 112., et seq.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 114, and 116-118.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 117-121.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 122, 123.\n\n224.\n\nSteag emphasizes that the parties have not debated whether the RRO falls within the scope of Article 107(1) of the TFEU.320 Moreover, if the European Commission were to declare the RRO to be unlawful State aid, such a decision could not be enforced against Steag. Instead, it would constitute a new breach of the FET standard.321 The applicability of the ECT to subsidy or financial aid programs is limited to Article 10(7) of the ECT and, in any case, does not affect the application of Article 10(1) of the ECT.322\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 117.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 117.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 117.\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that the RRO \"*has not been declared either lawful or unlawful State aid*.\"323 Although the European Commission has addressed the NRR,324 it has not examined either the premium or the possibility of appealing a tariff under the RRO.325 Nor has it referred to the RRO in abstract terms.326 The only aspect of the RRO considered by the Commission was the cash flows of standard installations.327 However, even if the decision on the NRR contained a ruling on the RRO, the fact remains that this decision by the Commission is not final and is still subject to ongoing proceedings.328 The Claimant concludes by stating that Spain cannot avoid enforcement of an award in favor of Steag by invoking the argument of State aid.329\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 125.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 126.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 126.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 126-128.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 126.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 129.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 130.\n\n226.\n\nRegarding the European Commission's decision in the case of *Micula v. Romania*, Steag notes that this decision is currently under review by the CJEU.330 Additionally, in Micula, the European Commission had declared the provision that served as the basis for the claimed compensation to be unlawful, which represents a key distinction from the present case.331 Furthermore, the dispute in *Micula* concerned the elimination of incentives as a result of Romania's accession to the EU, whereas in this case, Spain's measures were not adopted to comply with EU law obligations.332 The Claimant further argues that, according to the CJEU's own case law, compensation for unlawful acts by a State does not constitute illegal State aid.333\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 134, referring to the Appeal lodged on November 28, 2015 \u2013 Micula and Others v.

Tribunal's Analysis\n----------------------\n\n227.\n\nHaving considered all the arguments presented by the Parties regarding the intra-EU jurisdictional objection raised by the Respondent, the Tribunal finds that the discussion has centered around five key issues:\n\n(1) What effect does the CJEU's decision in *Achmea* have on the Tribunal's jurisdiction?\n\n(2) Does the ECT impose obligations concerning intra-EU investors and intra-EU investments?\n\n(3) Should this Tribunal give preference to applying EU law?\n\n(4) What effect do European treaties have on obligations under the ECT in light of Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT?\n\n(5) Should the Tribunal decline jurisdiction over the dispute due to the issue of State aid?\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal will now analyze the Parties' arguments on each of these issues.\n\n3.1. Preliminary Issue: The Relevance of the CJEU's Decision in *Achmea*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nSpain argues that the CJEU's ruling in *Achmea \"is law\"*334 and is therefore \"*extendable*\" to this arbitration.335 The Respondent presents several reasons for this assertion. First, while Spain acknowledges that the CJEU's ruling specifically addressed a BIT between two EU Member States,336 it maintains that the principles established in that decision can be extended to cases under the ECT.337 Second, Spain argues that the grounds for the Achmea decision are not merely \"*formalistic*\" but also substantive, as they are applicable wherever the origin of an investment tribunal's jurisdiction conflicts with the autonomy of the EU legal system.338 *Third,* the Achmea decision references an *\"international agreement concluded between Member State*\"339 and since the ECT is also an \"*international agreement concluded between Member States*,\" Spain maintains that Achmea's conclusions should apply to Article 26(4) of the ECT340 in this case.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 81\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 145 et seq.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 146.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 147.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 148.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 151 (emphasis omitted).\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 152.\n\n230.\n\nThe Investor contends that the CJEU's ruling341 in Achmea should not apply to this case because *the source of jurisdiction in Achmea was a BIT between the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia, and the tribunal's seat was in Germany, an EU Member State*.*342* The Investor also emphasizes that the Achmea case does not analyze the international law instruments applicable to this dispute, namely the ECT and the ICSID Convention, but instead concerns the interaction between a BIT and EU law.343 Steag argues that EU law is not among the applicable laws in this arbitration.344 It further highlights that the Tribunal is constituted under the ECT and does not belong to the EU judicial system.345 Finally, the Claimant asserts that the *Achmea* case does not establish a rule of international law applicable to this case but rather resolves a specific dispute with highly particular circumstances.346 Steag argues that Spain has failed to demonstrate the existence of an international legal norm requiring Article 26 of the ECT to be interpreted in light of Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, as construed by the CJEU.347 In summary, the Claimant contends that, given the differences between the two cases, the CJEU's reasoning in *Achmea* is not extendable to the circumstances of this arbitration.348\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 22; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 103 et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 85, 88; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 104, 105.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 88; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 104.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 87, 88; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 105.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 86, 87.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 110.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 111.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 104, 105, 110 and 111.\n\n231.\n\nGiven the arguments presented by the Parties, this Tribunal must answer the following question: Is the CJEU's ruling in *Achmea* extendable to the ECT?\n\n232.\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the CJEU issued its judgment in Case C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*.*349* The judgment found that Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU \" *must be interpreted as precluding a provision of an international treaty concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Treaty on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic*.\"350 The CJEU held that granting jurisdiction to the tribunal constituted under the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT to interpret and apply EU law undermines the \"*The dialogue from judge to judge, precisely between the Court of Justice and the judicial bodies of the Member States, is intended to ensure the uniform interpretation of Union law, thereby guaranteeing its coherence, its full effectiveness, and its autonomy, as well as, ultimately, the specific character of the law established by the Treaties*.\"351 The CJEU further stated that *\"an arbitral tribunal such as the one established under Article 8 of the BIT cannot be regarded as a 'court or tribunal of a Member State' within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU and is therefore not entitled to make a preliminary reference to the Court of Justice*.\"352\n\nJudgment of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the case *Slovak Republic v.

Three reasons support this conclusion:\n\n234.\n\n*One*. As other tribunals have affirmed,353 the *Achmea* case involved specific factual and legal circumstances that distinguish it from a case under Article 26 of the ECT. The CJEU's decision in Achmea pertained to a specific, bilateral BIT concluded between two EU Member States The CJEU did not address the situation of a multilateral treaty with a \"*mixed*\" nature, concluded by the EU itself, its Member States, and third countries.354 For these purposes, the ECT is hardly comparable to the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT. The CJEU's analysis in Achmea was confined to that specific context. As rightly noted by the tribunal in *Vattenfall v. Germany*, in Achmea, the CJEU did not examine the distinction between dispute resolution clauses in bilateral treaties between EU Member States and the ECT, as outlined in the Opinion of Advocate General M. Wathelet, dated September 19, 2017.355\n\nSee *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability, and Partial Decision on Damages, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/20 (February 19, 2019), \u00b6 144 [**CL-0158**]; *Vattenfall AB et al. v.

Wathelet.\n\n235.\n\n*Two*. Unlike Article 26(4) of the ECT, Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT does not provide for arbitration under the ICSID Convention. In *Achmea*, the proceeding was not protected by the 1965 Washington Convention. This was an arbitration proceeding under the UNCITRAL rules and based in Frankfurt, Germany.356 This arbitration is governed by the ICSID Convention and is not seated within the territory of any EU Member State. The courts of EU Member States lack jurisdiction to annul the award. As rightly noted by the tribunal in *Cube Infrastructure v. Spain*, an ICSID tribunal constituted under the ECT cannot be equated with a UNCITRAL tribunal seated within an EU Member State. \"[\u2026] The Tribunal owes its emergence to two international treaties, the ECT and the ICSID Convention, that are not specifically connected to the legal order of one of the States involved. Both instruments are multilateral agreements that have a scope of application *ratione personae* and *ratione territorii* that extends far beyond the boundaries of the EU [\u2026].\"357\n\nJudgment of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the case *Slovak Republic v.

Original text: \"*The Tribunal owes its emergence to two international treaties, the ECT and the ICSID Convention, that are not specifically connected to the legal order of one of the States involved. Both instruments are multilateral agreements that have a scope of application ratione personae and ratione territorii that extends far beyond the boundaries of the EU*\". *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV et al. v.

Federal Republic of Germany*, Decision on the *Achmea* Issue, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12 (August 31, 2018), \u00b6 159 [**CL-0131**].\n\n237.\n\nFrom a reading of the two treaties, it can be affirmed that, due to the nature, the parties involved, and the scope of the ECT, it cannot be equated with the BIT between the Netherlands and Slovakia, which was the subject of the CJEU's decision in *Achmea*. The Tribunal thus concludes that the reasoning and conclusions of the CJEU's decision in *Achmea* cannot be transposed to this arbitration proceeding.\n\n3.2. The Applicability of the ECT to Intra-EU Investors and Investments\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nOne of the core aspects of Spain's intra-EU jurisdictional objection is that, according to the Respondent, Article 26 of the ECT refers to disputes between \"*a Contracting Party*\" and \"*an investor of another Contracting Party*,\" which, in its view, excludes its application in the context of an intra-EU dispute.360 The Respondent cites several provisions of the ECT.361 The argument focuses on Articles 1(2), 1(3), 1(10), and 36(7) of the ECT, which relate to ORIES,362 as well as Articles 16, 25, and 26 of the ECT.363 In Spain's view, the nature of EU law indicates that, by ratifying the ECT, EU Member States did not undertake obligations towards each other under Part III of the treaty.364\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 58. See also Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 75-77.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 75 et seq.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 76-79 and 82.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 80, 81 and 83.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 173-181 and 195.\n\n239.\n\nIn response, Steag argues that Article 26(1) of the ECT, and the absence of a disconnection clause in the body of the ECT, make it clear that intra-EU disputes are not excluded from the scope of the ECT.365 According to Steag, Article 26(1) only requires that the investor be from a Contracting Party and that the Contracting Party not be the same as the Respondent Contracting Party.366 In the Claimant's view, the definitions in the ECT indicate that both the EU and an EU Member State can violate the ECT and be sued by investors from any other Contracting Party.367\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 42, et seq. 51, et seq.; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 61, et seq. and 80, et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 48.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 75 et seq.\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant is correct. The interpretation of the ECT under the general rule of interpretation in Article 31 of the VCLT leads to this conclusion. A reading of the provisions invoked by Spain (namely, Articles 1, 16, 25, 26, and 36 of the ECT) \u2013 considering their context and the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the treaty \u2013 supports the conclusion that the ECT applies to intra-EU disputes.\n\n241.\n\nThe Tribunal's starting point is Article 26(1) of the ECT, which refers to: \"*Disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of another Contracting Party regarding an alleged breach by the former of an obligation under Part III relating to an investment made by the latter in the territory of the former.*\" A reading of this provision reveals the absence of an explicit exclusion of intra-EU disputes.368 The interpretation of Article 26(1) of the ECT in light of the definitions set forth in Article 1 of the Treaty confirms this observation and further indicates that there is no implicit exclusion of intra-EU disputes.\n\nSee *Blusun S.A. et al. v. Republic of Italy,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3 (December 27, 2016), \u00b6 280 [**RL-0068**] (\" *On its face there is nothing in the text of the ECT that carves out or excludes issues arising between EU Member States*\").\n\n242.\n\nThe ECT defines the term \"*Contracting Party*\" in Article 1(2):\n\n\"[...] 'Contracting Party' means a State or a Regional Economic Integration Organization that has agreed to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force.\"\n\n243.\n\nIn turn, Article 1(3) of the ECT provides a definition of \"*Regional Economic Integration Organization\":*\n\n\"[...] 'Regional Economic Integration Organization' means an organization constituted by States to which they have transferred competence over certain matters, some of which are governed by this Treaty, including the power to make binding decisions on those States with respect to such matters.\"\n\n244.\n\nThe term \"*territory*\" is also expressly defined in the ECT. Under Article 1(10) of the ECT, this term refers to both the territory of a Contracting State and the territory of an ORIE:\n\n\"[...] \"Territory\", *in relation to a State that is a Contracting Party*, means\n\na) the territory over which it exercises sovereignty, including land, internal waters, and the territorial sea; and\n\nb) in accordance with international maritime law, the sea, seabed, and subsoil, over which the Contracting Party exercises sovereign rights and jurisdiction.\n\n*With respect to a Regional Economic Integration Organization that is a Contracting Party*, the term \"territory\" shall encompass the 'territories' of the Member States of such organization, as defined in the agreement establishing that organization.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that these provisions, invoked by Spain to justify the exclusion of intra-EU disputes from the scope of Article 26 of the ECT,369 actually lead to the opposite conclusion. The text of the ECT indicates that there is a diversity of territories when an EU investor brings a claim against an EU Member State, provided that the latter is different from the investor's home country. As explained by the tribunal in *Isolux v. Spain*:\n\n\"[...] Both the territory of the Netherlands and the territory of the Kingdom of Spain are part of the territory of the EU as an ORIE. However, the same Article specifies that, concerning a State that is a Contracting Party, \"*territory*\" means \"*the territory over which it exercises sovereignty*.\" There is no doubt that the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Spain exercise sovereignty over their respective national territories.\n\nThus, the fact that the \"*territory*\" of the EU, according to Article 1(10) of the ECT, encompasses the territories of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Spain does not prevent each of them from also having a \"*territory*\" within the meaning of the ECT. Only an interpretation of Article 26(1) of the ECT can determine which \"territory\" must be considered to assess whether the requirement of territorial diversity is met.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nArticle 26(1) refers to disputes between \"*a Contracting Party and an investor of another Contracting Party... concerning an investment made by the latter in the territory of the former.*\" This clearly implies that the relevant territory is that of the Contracting Party against which the investor is acting. In the present dispute, the alleged investment was made in Spain by an investor claiming to be Dutch and who is acting under the ECT against the Kingdom of Spain, not against the EU.\"370\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 76-79 and 82.\n\n*Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands BV v.

Spain* concluded that \"*the dispute submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal presents itself as a dispute between a Contracting Party (Spain) and an investor of another Contracting Party (the Netherlands) regarding an investment made by the latter in the former*.\"371 According to the tribunal in that case, \"*the fact that the Kingdom of Spain and the Netherlands belong to the same ORIE does not mean that this dispute cannot be raised by an investor of one Contracting Party against another Contracting Party*.\"372 These conclusions, which this Tribunal shares, are fully consistent with the decisions of other tribunals constituted under the ECT.373\n\n*Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands BV v.

In the present case, both Germany and Spain are \"*Contracting Parties*\" with their respective territories, in accordance with the definitions in Article 1 of the ECT. If the EU and Spain are independent and autonomous Contracting Parties, the ECT can be applied separately concerning the responsibility of each. As the tribunal in *BayWa r.e. v. Spain* stated:\n\n\"[I]f, as the Tribunal considers, the Member States were Contracting Parties to the ECT in their own right, there is no difficulty in applying Article 26 severally to them in matters concerning their own territory and responsibility\".374\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal.

Steag has rightly insisted that its legal personality is determined by German law and not by EU law.375 Article 1(7)(ii) of the ECT states that an \"*investor*\" is \"*a company or other organization incorporated under the applicable law of a Contracting Party.*\" Consequently, what is determinative for jurisdictional purposes is the legal system under which a company was incorporated, regardless of whether that place of incorporation is within the territory of an ORIE.376 For this Tribunal, Steag is a company incorporated under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, and for the purposes of Article 26(1) of the ECT, it is not required to be an EU investor making an investment within the EU, but rather a German investor making an investment in the Kingdom of Spain.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 77. The Claimant also highlights that even EU citizenship depends on the nationality of a Member State under Article 20.1 of the TFEU (\u00b6 75).\n\n*Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen GmbH et al. v. Kingdom of Spain,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/1 (December 2, 2019), \u00b6 128 [**RL-0146**] (\"*The operative word in Article 26(1) is* \"*organized,*\" *not* \"*operating under*\" *or* \"*functioning under*\" *a particular State's law. While it is true that all the Claimants by virtue of conducting their activities within the EU are therefore operating to some degree under EU law, they were not created or organized under EU law, but under the laws of Germany or, in Marquesado's case, of Spain. Thus, it cannot be said that, for purpose of Article 26(1) of the ECT, they are Investors of the EU, as well as of Germany*\").\n\n249.\n\nIn light of the definitions provided in Article 1 of the ECT and the text of Article 26(1) of the ECT, it becomes abundantly clear that the Contracting Parties did not agree \u2014 either explicitly or implicitly \u2014 on a disconnection clause that would exclude certain \"*disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of another Contracting Party*\" from the scope of Article 26. The interpretation of these provisions as an implicit disconnection clause has been repeatedly rejected by other arbitral tribunals. In *RREEF v. Spain*, the tribunal explained:\n\n\"The purpose of a disconnection clause is to make clear that EU Member States will apply EU law in their relations inter se rather than the convention in which it is inserted. Absent such a clause in a multilateral treaty, it is intended to be integrally applied by the EU and its Member States. It has not been challenged that no such clause has been included in the ECT. [\u2026] In the Tribunal's view, given that there is no disharmony or conflict between the ECT and EU, as noted above, there was simply no need for a disconnection clause, implicit or explicit.\"377\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal.

This conclusion is even more compelling given the fact that, as the Claimant points out, the ECT contains provisions regulating its effects in cases of potential conflicts with other treaties, such as the Svalbard Treaty.379 This suggests that, as other tribunals have found,380 if the Parties had truly intended to exclude intra-EU relations from the scope of Article 26 of the ECT, they would have explicitly agreed to do so. Moreover, this Tribunal cannot overlook the fact that, when ratifying the ECT, both the European Communities and their Member States refrained from making any reservation regarding the intra-EU scope.381\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 56.\n\nSee *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v.

It has nothing to do with the scope of Article 26 of the ECT.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 82.\n\n253.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal does not find that Articles 16 and 25 of the ECT indicate that the ECT is inapplicable to intra-EU relations.383 This argument is particularly focused on the alleged primacy of EU law. For this reason, the Tribunal will address it in section 3.3 below.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 80, 81 and 83.\n\n3.3. The Relevance of EU Law for Determining the Tribunal's Jurisdiction\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe third issue raised by the Parties concerning the intra-EU objection relates to the relevance of EU law to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Spain argues that it has not consented to submit to arbitration \"*issues [\u2026] concerning the autonomy and primacy of the [EU legal] order*.384 The Respondent analyzes Article 26(6) of the ECT and contends that it \"*prevents an intra-EU investor from bringing an arbitration claim against an EU Member State for its investment*.*\"*385 The Claimant, on the other hand, opposes Spain's arguments in this context. According to Steag, EU law is neither applicable nor relevant to determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction.386\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 7 (see also \u00b6\u00b6 73, et seq. and 84-205).

The text of this provision is as follows:\n\n\"A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\"\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this clause does not create an obstacle to the exercise of jurisdiction over the present case. Nor does it consider EU law to be determinative for the jurisdictional decision. Four reasons support this conclusion.\n\n257.\n\n*One*. Article 26(6) of the ECT refers only to the law applicable to the merits of the dispute. The Tribunal cannot ignore or overlook the distinction between the law applicable to the merits and the law applicable to jurisdiction.387 A reading of Article 26(6) of the ECT in its context, in accordance with the general rule of interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT, indicates that the \"*issues in dispute*\" are precisely those relating to the substantive obligations set forth in Part III of the ECT.388 It cannot be otherwise, as Article 26(1) limits the Tribunal's jurisdiction to disputes concerning Part III of the ECT, and it is therefore in relation to those disputes that the choice of applicable law expressed in Article 26(6) of the ECT applies.389 In *Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen v. Spain*, the tribunal aptly explained:\n\n\"The Tribunal notes that contrary to what the Respondent argues, the law applicable to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is not prescribed by Article 26(6) of the ECT but by Articles 26(1)-(5), which confer jurisdiction upon the Tribunal. Article 26(6) of the ECT does not, therefore, assist the Respondent in demonstrating the superiority of EU law or its protection system over the ECT for the purposes of deciding this jurisdictional objection. Article 26(6) governs the law applicable to the merits of the dispute; this is clear from the wording of this provision: \"A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.\" A \"dispute\" is defined in Article 26(1) as \"an alleged breach by [a Contracting Party] under Part III.\" Part III of the ECT contains the substantive standards of protections, while the dispute resolution provision can be found in Part V of the ECT (\"Dispute Resolution\"). EU law, and in particular Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, as interpreted in *Achmea*, does not, therefore, govern this Tribunal's jurisdiction by virtue of Article 26(6) of the ECT.\"390\n\n*OperaFund Eco-Invest SICAV PLC and Schwab Holding AG v.

Spain*, when it stated that if the Parties had intended for Article 26(6) of the treaty to apply to jurisdictional issues and extend beyond Part III of the ECT, they would have expressed that intention in the text of the provision.391\n\n*SolEs Badajoz GmbH v. Reino de Espa\u00f1a*, Award, Case ICSID No. ARB/15/38 (July 31, 2019), \u00b6 157 [**CL-0161**] (\"*Absent an indication to the contrary, the phrase* \"*issues in dispute*\" *in paragraph (6) of Article 26 can be expected to have the same scope as paragraph (1), which refers to disputes that* \"*concern an alleged breach of an obligation [...] under Part III,*\" *in other words, to the merits of a dispute. If the drafters of the ECT had intended the scope of Article 26(6) to extend beyond Part III of the ECT, such that it governed the law to be applied by Tribunal to decide whether it had jurisdiction over a dispute, they could have so indicated. Article 16 of the ECT, which addresses the relationship between the ECT and other treaties, for example, refers both to Part III and Part V (Dispute Settlement)*\").\n\n259.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that Article 26(6) of the ECT expresses an agreement between the parties regarding the applicable law for the purposes of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, under which *\"[t]he Tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.\"* The reference in Article 42(1) to \"*the dispute*\" indicates that the provision concerns exclusively the law applicable to the merits, and not to jurisdiction.392 This is entirely consistent with the interpretation of Article 26(6) of the ECT as a rule concerning the law applicable to the substance of the dispute. In this context, it is useful to refer to the analysis of the tribunal in the case of *Vattenfall v. Germany*:\n\n\"Under the ICSID Convention, a jurisdictional objection is clearly demarcated from the merits of the dispute. When Article 42(1) refers to the applicable law when the Tribunal \"decides a dispute\", it therefore does not include a decision on any jurisdictional objection [\u2026] Since the Parties have made an agreement in Article 26(6) of the ECT regarding the applicable law, the default rule in the second sentence of Article 42(1) ICSID Convention does not come into operation. [\u2026] In conclusion, Article 26(6) ECT, either viewed through Article 42(1) ICSID Convention or interpreted independently of the ICSID Convention, applies only to the merits of a dispute between the Parties.

For this reason, Respondent's argument that Article 26(6) brings EU law and the ECJ Judgment into application in the context of the Tribunal's jurisdiction must fail.\"393\n\n*Vattenfall AB et al. v.

The jurisdiction of this Tribunal is based on the very terms of the ECT and, in particular, its Articles 26(1) to 26(5).394 The source of this Tribunal's jurisdiction is the ECT and not EU law.395\n\n*Vattenfall AB et al. v.

On the contrary, its interpretation and application are governed by the law of treaties.396 In this context, Spain has suggested that EU law could be applied under the \"*proximity principle*\" of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.397 The Claimant challenges this argument and considers that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that Article 26 of the ECT must be interpreted in light of the TEU and the TFEU, as interpreted by the CJEU in the *Achmea* case.398 The proximity principle of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT is not relevant for determining this Tribunal's jurisdiction, which derives from the ECT, for the reasons expressed in the preceding paragraphs.399\n\n*Vattenfall AB et al. v.

[**RL-0146**].\n\n262.\n\n*Second.* The Respondent's argument is based on the premise that there is an irreconcilable conflict between EU law and the protection of intra-EU investments and investors under the ECT.400 The Claimant, on the other hand, has emphasized that EU law is compatible with the ECT.401 This Tribunal does not find that the Respondent has demonstrated the existence of a specific incompatibility between a provision of the ECT and EU law. The Respondent asserts but does not explain or prove that the dispute affects EU freedoms. Nor does it substantiate how this proceeding affects the CJEU's competence in applying EU law, thereby endangering the autonomy of EU law.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 63; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 75.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 83 et seq.\n\n263.\n\nThe ECT and EU treaties establish fully coherent regimes.402 While the ECT specifically aims to establish \"*a legal framework to promote long-term cooperation in the energy sector, based on achieving complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles expressed in the Charter*\" (Art. 2 of the ECT), the Preamble and Article 3 of the TEU, as well as the Preamble of the TFEU, indicate that the EU legal system pursues much broader objectives. However, the European integration process does not exclude the existence of a parallel regime in the energy sector, particularly when it has a different scope and involves third States.\n\nSee *Blusun S.A. et al. v. Republic of Italy,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3 (December 27, 2016), \u00b6\u00b6 292-303 [**RL-0068**].\n\n264.\n\nSpecifically regarding Article 26 of the ECT, this Tribunal does not find that there is a conflict between Article 26 of the ECT and Article 344 of the TFEU. Article 26 of the ECT deals with \"*disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of another Contracting Party*,\" whereas Article 344 of the TFEU regulates the prohibition on Member States from bringing \"*disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties*\" of the EU before other tribunals. These are independent provisions, addressing different matters, and, as the Tribunal in *Vattenfall v. Germany* correctly stated, they can coexist and be applied simultaneously.403 The CJEU's decision in *Achmea*, which referred specifically to arbitration under a bilateral treaty between two EU Member States with a seat in the territory of an EU State, as explained in Section 3.1 above, does not affect this conclusion.\n\n*Vattenfall AB et al. v. Federal Republic of Germany*, Decision on the *Achmea* Issue, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12 (August 31, 2018), \u00b6 125 [**CL-0131**]. See also *Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen GmbH et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/1 (December 2, 2019), \u00b6\u00b6 138, et seq. [**RL-0146**].\n\n265.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that \"*from the moment a dispute affects the fundamental freedoms of the EU and the pillar of State aid, the CJEU is prevented from ensuring the full application of EU law*.\"404 However, Spain fails to explain why resolving this dispute requires the Tribunal to rule on EU law. As will be explained in Section 3.5 below, the Respondent also fails to demonstrate that resolving the dispute requires determining, in particular, whether the RRO constitutes State aid under EU law.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 185.\n\n266.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that this dispute specifically concerns Spain's obligations under Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT. To determine whether the Respondent has breached these obligations, it is not necessary to assess the validity of any EU act.405 Nor is it necessary to determine whether Spain's measures comply with EU law. This Tribunal will assess those measures solely under the ECT and not under EU law. For this reason, the exercise of jurisdiction in this case does not conflict with the competences of the CJEU or other European bodies. Declaring that the measures comply with the ECT or violate it does not imply any determination regarding their compliance with EU law, nor does it preclude competent bodies from making a decision on the matter in the future.\n\nA similar situation arose in the case C*haranne v. Spain* See *Charanne BV et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Award, SCC Case No. V 062/2012 (January 21, 2016), \u00b6 448 [**CL-0029**].\n\n267.\n\n*Third.* The Respondent has focused part of its argument on characterizing EU law as \"*applicable international law*\" under Article 26(6) of the ECT,406 arguing that EU law has primacy and that this primacy is also recognized in Article 25 of the ECT.407 The Claimant, in turn, analyzes the dualist and monist approaches and argues that, while EU law could be classified as public international law in its origins, today it constitutes a \"*distinct and autonomous legal order*.\"408 According to the Claimant, EU law is not applicable in this context and, in any case, does not prevail over the ECT.409\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 63 and 83, et seq.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 75, 173, 177-178, 185, et seq., 193 and 195.

It has also concluded that EU law is not relevant for determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Additionally, in the absence of a collision or inconsistency between the ECT and EU law, the debate over the hierarchy of one over the other loses any practical relevance for the present case.410\n\nSee *Novenergia II - Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), SICAR v. Kingdom of Spain*, Final Award, SCC Case No. 2015/063 (February 15, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 462, 463 [**CL-0069**].\n\n269.\n\nAlthough, in light of these conclusions, it would not be necessary to address the arguments related to the primacy and autonomy of EU law, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to refer to them, given the importance the Parties have attributed to this issue.\n\n270.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal finds the Respondent's interpretation of Article 25 of the ECT to be unfounded.411 On this particular issue, the Tribunal agrees with the interpretation of the tribunal in *Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen v. Spain*, which, when addressing a similar argument, concluded:\n\n\"[T]he Tribunal is equally unpersuaded by the Respondent's reliance on Article 25 of the ECT to support its position. This provision simply eliminates the possibility of Contracting Parties that are not parties to an Economic Integration Agreement to benefit from the treatment conferred between the parties to such agreement. It does not mandate the prevalence of the EU protection system in respect of the ECT. As such, this provision is inapposite for the present discussion.412\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 75, 173, 177-178, 185, et seq., 193 and 195.

In *Cube Infrastructure v. Spain*, the tribunal analyzed an argument very similar to the one presented by Spain in this arbitration and concluded:\n\n\"To say that EU law is a part of international law and yet has supremacy over other, non-EU components of international law is, in the view of the Tribunal, to mischaracterize EU law and confuse questions belonging to two different legal orders. The EU treaties are, certainly, international agreements of a kind familiar in international law, binding as between the States Parties; but they also function as the constitution of an autonomous community. The rules established by EU secondary legislation are essentially supra-national regulations rather than part of the corpus of international law as such. Similarly, EU law has supremacy *within the EU legal system* over the national laws of the States that are Members of the EU and accordingly subscribe to the EU legal system. But EU law is only one among several regional, and many national, legal systems; and it is international law that regulates relations between these different legal systems. *Within the system of international law, EU law does not have supremacy, and has no hierarchical priority over the laws of non-Member States, or over rules of international law, including the ECT. Any such claim to priority would challenge the basis of the ECT as a multilateral treaty, unilaterally asserting for the EU and its Member States a right to be treated differently from all other ECT Contracting Parties.* The ECT Contracting Parties could have agreed expressly to give different treatment to the EU and its Member States in relation to the matters relevant to the present dispute; but they did not do so. Indeed, it appears that they were not asked to do so.\"415\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal.

But EU law is only one among several regional, and many national, legal systems; and it is international law that regulates relations between these different legal systems. Within the system of international law, EU law does not have supremacy, and has no hierarchical priority over the laws of non-Member States, or over rules of international law, including the ECT. Any such claim to priority would challenge the basis of the ECT as a multilateral treaty, unilaterally asserting for the EU and its Member States a right to be treated differently from all other ECT Contracting Parties. The ECT Contracting Parties could have agreed expressly to give different treatment to the EU and its Member States in relation to the matters relevant to the present dispute; but they did not do so. Indeed, it appears that they were not asked to do so*\". *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV et al. v.

The Tribunal once again emphasizes that its source of jurisdiction is the ECT, that is, a treaty that establishes obligations for EU Member States and the EU itself in relation to third States. Therefore, EU law is not determinative for this Tribunal's jurisdiction.416\n\nSee also *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Ltd. et al. v.

Spain*, the tribunal analyzed Article 16 of the ECT and correctly concluded that Article 16 of the ECT requires, as an initial condition, that there be a treaty addressing the same subject matter as Parts III or V of the ECT.420 It is evident that, for the conflict rule to apply, there must first be a conflict.421 That condition, it must be reiterated, is not met in the present case.\n\n*Vattenfall AB et al. v.

The Respondent argues that the EU system provides a level of protection similar to that offered by the ECT.422 However, it does not explain why the EU treaties should be considered to offer greater protection than that provided by the ECT. In *BayWa v. Spain*, analyzing an objection similar to the one raised by the Respondent in this case, the tribunal found that Parts III and V of the ECT would be the more favorable rule.423 Similarly, in *Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen v.

The Effects of EU Treaties on Obligations under the ECT in Light of Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe Respondent argues that there is a conflict between the ECT and EU treaties that should be resolved in accordance with Articles 30 and 59 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), rather than under Article 16 of the ECT.426 The Claimant acknowledges that EU law could be classified as public international law in its origins, but considers that it has now become an autonomous legal order427 and that if a conflict existed between EU law and the ECT, the ECT would prevail.428\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 186, 194.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 74, 75.

It also found that there is no conflict between EU law and the ECT and that, if a conflict did exist, it would be resolved in favor of the ECT, pursuant to Article 16 of the ECT. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal need only rule on the Parties' arguments regarding the effects of Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT on the relationship between the ECT and EU law.\n\n280.\n\nArticle 30 of the VCLT establishes the rules that must be considered in determining which treaty applies in the event of incompatibility between the \"*rights and obligations*\" of the parties in successive treaties on the same subject matter.429\n\n\"Article 30. Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter.  \n1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations of States parties to successive treaties concerning the same subject matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.  \n2. When a treaty specifies that it is subordinate to a prior or subsequent treaty or that it should not be considered incompatible with that other treaty, the provisions of the latter shall prevail.  \n3. When all parties to the prior treaty are also parties to the subsequent treaty, but the prior treaty is neither terminated nor its application suspended pursuant to Article 59, the prior treaty shall apply only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the subsequent treaty.  \n4. When the parties to the prior treaty are not all parties to the subsequent treaty:  \na) In relations between States that are parties to both treaties, the rule set out in paragraph 3 shall apply.  \nb) In relations between a State that is a party to both treaties and a State that is a party to only one of them, their mutual rights and obligations shall be governed by the treaty to which both States are parties.  \n5. Paragraph 4 shall apply without prejudice to the provisions of Article 41 and shall not prejudge any issue of termination or suspension of the application of a treaty under Article 60, nor any question of liability that a State may incur for concluding or applying a treaty whose provisions are incompatible with obligations undertaken toward another State under a different treaty.\"\n\n281.\n\nArticle 59 of the VCLT governs the compatibility between a prior and a subsequent treaty in time:430\n\n\"Article 59. Termination of a treaty or suspension of its application implied by the conclusion of a subsequent treaty.  \n1. A treaty shall be considered terminated if all its parties subsequently conclude another treaty on the same subject matter and:  \na) It is apparent from the subsequent treaty or otherwise evident that the parties intended for the subject matter to be governed by that treaty; or  \nb) The provisions of the subsequent treaty are so incompatible with those of the prior treaty that both treaties cannot be applied simultaneously.  \nA treaty shall be considered suspended in its application only if it is apparent from the subsequent treaty or otherwise evident that this was the intention of the parties.\n\n282.\n\nThe difference between Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT lies in the fact that while Article 59 refers to the termination of a treaty, Article 30 concerns situations where there are specific inconsistencies between prior and subsequent treaties.431 Article 59 of the VCLT presupposes not only that the two treaties address the same subject matter, but also that it is clear that the parties intended to terminate the earlier treaty, as per Article 59(1)(a), or that there is such an incompatibility that it is impossible to apply both treaties simultaneously, as per Article 59(1)(b).\n\n*Mr. J\u00fcrgen Wirtgen et al. v. Czech Republic,* Final Award, PCA Case No. 2014-13 (October 11, 2017). \u00b6 260 [**RL-0100**].\n\n283.\n\nThe Respondent has not demonstrated compliance with either of these requirements. First, it has not shown that the ECT and EU law address the same subject matter. Nor has it demonstrated that the parties intended to terminate the ECT, in accordance with Article 59(1)(a). As for Article 59(1)(b), the Tribunal reiterates that it has found no incompatibility between the ECT and EU law, which means that there is no impediment to the simultaneous application of both treaties. There is complementarity, not incompatibility \u2014 whether substantive or procedural \u2014 between the ECT and EU law.\n\n284.\n\nThe Parties' arguments regarding Article 30 of the VCLT have focused on Articles 30(3) and 30(4) of the VCLT. This Tribunal begins by noting that these provisions apply when the treaties between which the alleged inconsistency arises do not contain a conflict rule. If a special conflict rule has been agreed upon, it prevails over the provisions of the VCLT (*lex specialis*). The Tribunal notes that in this case, there is an express conflict rule, which is found in Article 16 of the ECT. For the reasons presented in Section 3.3 above, this Tribunal concludes that said rule favors the application of the ECT in the present case. Article 30(3) of the VCLT only applies when \"*all the parties to the earlier treaty are also parties to the later treaty*.\" This requirement is not met between the ECT on one hand and the TEU and TFEU on the other. The Contracting Parties to the ECT include, in addition to EU Member States, the EU itself and third States.\n\n285.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal's conclusion regarding the absence of a conflict between the obligations established in the ECT and those arising from the TEU and TFEU is also relevant for analyzing Articles 30(3) and 30(4) of the VCLT. Indeed, if there are no inconsistencies, Article 30 of the VCLT is inapplicable.\n\n3.5. State Aid Regime\n---------------------\n\n286.\n\nSpain argues that the compensation sought by Steag falls within a \"subsidy scheme\" and would constitute State aid.432 According to the Respondent, given that the incentives provided under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 constitute State aid,433 this case requires the Tribunal to determine the right to receive State aid, thereby exercising competences reserved under EU law to the Commission.434 According to the Respondent, if the market were distorted by a decision in favor of Steag, it would constitute a violation of EU law.435 In its arguments, the Respondent also suggests that Article 10(8) of the ECT excludes the application of the treaty to subsidies.436\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 90 and 97-99; Post-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 177.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 100-103 and 107.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 98, 103, and 107.

The Tribunal first notes, preliminarily, that, as stated in the award rendered in *Greentech v. Spain*, the European Commission's decision on the NRR does not assess the RRO, and in particular, RD 661/2007.441\n\n*Foresight Luxembourg Solar 1 S.\u00c0.R.L. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Final Award, SCC Case No. V2015/150 (November 14, 2018), \u00b6 381 [**RL-0142**]. The Parties addressed this aspect of the decision in their post-hearing briefs: Response to the Claimant's Comments on the Decision on Liability and Principles of Damages in *RREEF v. Spain* and on the Award in *Greentech v. Spain*, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20 (specifically referring to the Partially Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Ra\u00fal E. Vinuesa [**RL-0143**]); Response to Spain's Comments on the *Greentech* Award and the *RREEF* Decision, \u00b6 48.\n\n289.\n\nThe dispute before this Tribunal concerns an alleged breach of obligations under the ECT, not a dispute regarding the State aid status of the RRO. Indeed, the classification of the incentives granted under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 as State aid is not a legal issue that this Tribunal needs to resolve in order to decide the dispute concerning Spain's obligations under the ECT.\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the Respondent's arguments regarding the alleged illegality of the RRO under the EU State aid regime and its relevance to the analysis of Steag's legitimate expectations. In particular, Spain has argued that the RRO constitutes State aid that, having not been notified to the Commission, is illegal and could not have given rise to any legitimate expectation.442\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 109, referring to European Commission Decision C(2017) 7384, S.A. 40348(2015/NN) (November 10, 2017) \u00b6 158 [**RL-0092**].\n\n291.\n\nAs previously indicated, in order to decide the present case, the Tribunal does not need to determine whether the RRO qualifies as State aid under EU law. Nevertheless, the Tribunal accepts that, in principle, the possible applicability of the State aid regime may be a factor to consider when making an investment, and, as a result, it may have an impact on the assessment of the legitimate expectations the investor had at the time of investment. This was affirmed by the tribunal in *Antin v. Spain*:\n\n\"In principle, the issue of whether an investor in an EU Member State that provides state aid to RE investors should, when making the investment, consider that the State's RE subsidy program is governed not only by the applicable national regime, but also by EU state aid rules which are legally binding on Member States under EU law, could be relevant to determine the legitimate expectations of the investor.\"443\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal. Original text: \"*In principle, the issue of whether an investor in an EU Member State that provides state aid to RE investors should, when making the investment, consider that the State's RE subsidy program is governed not only by the applicable national regime, but also by EU state aid rules which are legally binding on Member States under EU law, could be relevant to determine the legitimate expectations of the investor*\". *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31 (June 15, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 658 [**CL-0130**].\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that the mere absence of notification of the RRO to the Commission does not, in itself, exclude the possibility of legitimate expectations arising. It must be determined, for example, to what extent the State can base a defense on its own omissions and what scope or consequences should be attributed to them. Additionally, it must be assessed what a reasonable and diligent investor could have expected under the circumstances of the case. As the tribunal stated in *Cube Infrastructure v. Spain*:\n\n\"The obligations regarding State aid were incumbent upon the Respondent, and investors were entitled to assume that they had been taken into account by the Respondent when drafting its legislation. It was not for the Claimants to second-guess the Respondent's legislature. Moreover, at the time that the investments were made it was not at all clear that the tariff regime should be regarded as State aid, let alone as impermissible State aid.\"444\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal. Original text: \"*The obligations regarding State aid were incumbent upon the Respondent, and investors were entitled to assume that they had been taken into account by the Respondent when drafting its legislation. It was not for the Claimants to second-guess the Respondent's legislature. Moreover, at the time that the investments were made it was not at all clear that the tariff regime should be regarded as State aid, let alone as impermissible State aid*\". *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability, and Partial Decision on Damages, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/20 (February 19, 2019), \u00b6 306 [**CL-0158**].\n\n293.\n\nHowever, this merely means that the State aid regime is one of many factors that, within the factual matrix of a particular case, must be considered when assessing the investor's expectations. The issue is not whether Spain complied with its obligations under EU law, but rather to determine, as a matter of fact, whether the risk of non-compliance should have been taken into account by the investor (and, if so, to what extent) when committing its capital to the Arenales Solar project.\n\n294.\n\nFor these reasons, the arguments put forward by Spain do not raise an issue of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, but rather a potential factual element of the discussion surrounding Steag's expectations, an issue that the Tribunal will consider in its decision on the merits, particularly in relation to the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal also takes note of Spain's argument that an award in favor of Steag could be considered unlawful State aid.445 The Tribunal does not find in this allegation a sufficiently substantiated jurisdictional argument. The argument is based on a series of assumptions about potential future decisions of the European Commission and other EU bodies. However, the Respondent has not demonstrated the existence of a real risk that a favorable award for the investor, protected under the ICSID Convention, would be unenforceable for this reason. Nor does Spain's argument consider that, since this Tribunal is not seated in the territory of an EU Member State, the award is not subject to annulment by the courts of any such State. Furthermore, Spain has not explained to what extent the alleged risk of non-compliance with the award could or should affect the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 105.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal does not rule out, purely as a hypothesis, that the enforcement of a favorable award for Steag in some jurisdictions, particularly within the territory of EU Member States, may face challenges if Spain's argument on State aid were to be accepted. However, the mere fact that the enforcement of an award might hypothetically be difficult does not mean that the award is unenforceable. The Tribunal's jurisdiction derives from the ECT and the ICSID Convention. The national legal frameworks governing the enforcement of awards do not determine the exercise of jurisdiction conferred upon this Tribunal by those instruments.\n\n297.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the Parties have briefly referred to Articles 10(7) and 10(8) of the ECT. The Tribunal observes that Article 10(8) refers to: *\"[t]he conditions of application of paragraph 7 to programs under which a Contracting Party grants subsidies or other types of financial aid or enters into research and development contracts for energy technologies [\u2026].\"* The provision indicates that those conditions of application \"*shall be reserved for the supplementary treaty mentioned in paragraph 4*\". This Tribunal agrees with the Claimant446 that both paragraph 7 and paragraph 4 (which, in turn, refers to paragraph 3 of Article 10 of the ECT) specifically concern obligations regarding more favorable treatment for other investors. None of the cited provisions exclude the application of the obligations established in Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT, which are precisely the provisions relevant to Steag's claims.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 117.\n\n298.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the Parties in this case and rejects the intra-EU objection raised by the Respondent.\n\n**B. The objection regarding the Tribunal's jurisdiction over matters relating to the introduction of the TVPEE**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its consent to arbitration does not cover the dispute concerning the alleged violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT through the introduction of the TVPEE, and therefore, this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the matter.447 According to Spain, by operation of Article 21 of the ECT, Article 10(1) of the ECT *\"does not create obligations with respect to tax measures*.*\"*448\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 110-113; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 206 et seq. and 290.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 112, 113, 120 and 121; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 207, 218.\n\n300.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the TVPEE, introduced by Law 15/2012 (in force since January 1, 2013), \"*levies the production and injection of electricity into the Spanish electrical system*.\"449 Spain details the taxable base, applicable rate, and tax period of the TVPEE and characterizes it as \"*a general tax*\" applicable to conventional and renewable energy generation facilities.450\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 114-116; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 284.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 116-119.\n\n301.\n\nSpain argues that under Article 26 of the ECT, its consent to arbitration is limited to obligations derived from Part III of the ECT.

Russia* case, for example, the good faith analysis arose in a different situation than the present arbitration, relating to the use of a tax measure as a pretext to harm a political opponent.490 The Respondent challenges the relevance of a measure's economic effects for determining whether it qualifies as a tax measure, arguing that the key consideration is its \"*legal operation*.\"491 Spain further highlights that Steag has not proven that the TVPEE was adopted in bad faith.492\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 219 et seq.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 220 et seq.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 222, referring to the awards *Hulley Enterprises Ltd. v.

Claimant's Position\n----------------------\n\n311.\n\nThe Claimant does not dispute that the TVPEE is a \"*tax measure*\", but it challenges the notion that it is a measure adopted in good faith and therefore covered by Article 21 of the ECT.504 Steag also contends that the Respondent wrongly presents the TVPEE as an isolated measure, rather than the \"*first step*\" in the \"*drastic change*\" introduced to the RRO.505 According to the Claimant, \"*the TVPEE can be analyzed under Article 10(1) of the ECT as part of a composite measure by Spain that violates the fair and equitable treatment standard*.\"506 In particular, Steag argues that \"*the cumulative effect of all the Measures*,\" including the TVPEE, must be analyzed, a possibility recognized in arbitral decisions to prevent treaty protection from being circumvented through the \"*fragmentation of measures*.\"507 The Claimant thus asserts that, rather than a measure introduced in good faith, the TVPEE is one of the elements of the NRR, which in turn constitutes a \"*composite measure*\" in breach of the FET standard.508\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 111; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 142.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 112, 114.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 113.

Argentina* referred to \"*progressive violations*\" of the FET standard.512\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 117.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 118.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 119.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 119, citing the case *El Paso Energy International Company v.

Republic of Macedonia*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/16 (July 6, 2012), \u00b6 275 [**CL-0089**].\n\n313.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that, as recognized by other tribunals, Article 21 of the ECT only covers tax measures adopted in good faith, which makes it essential to assess whether Spain acted in good faith when introducing the TVPEE.513 According to Steag, Spain's arguments about good faith remain at the \"*purely legal and formal level*\" and never engage in an \"*economic analysis*\" of the issue.514 The Claimant explains that determining whether the TVPEE is a good faith tax measure that can be isolated from the other elements of the composite measure that Steag claims violates the ECT must be based on a \"*substantive assessment of the tax measure*\" rather than solely on Spain's formal characterization of it.515\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 121-124.

The NRR conditions total remuneration for operating costs on a minimum number of hours. If this minimum is not met, even though the remuneration for investment costs is received, the remuneration for operating costs is reduced. As a result, the TVPEE has a significant impact if Arenales Solar fails to reach the minimum threshold. In such a scenario, \"*the remuneration for operating costs must cover both the TVPEE levied on it and the TVPEE levied on the remuneration for investment costs.*\"\n\nb. The NRR introduced a \"*maximum number of operating hours*\" beyond which no additional remuneration is granted, yet the TVPEE continues to be levied, meaning it cannot be considered a \"*neutral cost*.\"\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 125 et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 125.

In this proceeding, the Supreme Court acknowledged the difficulty in identifying the \"*extrafiscal purpose*\" of the TVPEE.523 The Constitutional Court dismissed the constitutional challenge but did not specifically address this issue.524 The Claimant argues that this Tribunal must assess whether the TVPEE \"*serves the undeclared objective of covertly reducing the remuneration of renewable energy producers.*525 According to Steag, this is precisely the case.526\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 117, 127.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 156.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 158-161.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 162, citing the Order of the Second Section of the Administrative Litigation Chamber of the Supreme Court of Spain (January 10, 2018) [**CL-0143**].\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 163, citing Order No. 69/2018 of the Full Court of the Constitutional Court of Spain (June 20, 2018) [**CL-0144**].\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 164.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 165.\n\n3. Tribunal's Analysis\n----------------------\n\n316.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that it never consented to arbitration regarding the dispute arising from the alleged violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT due to the implementation of the TVPEE.527 Spain emphasizes that it has only consented to submit to arbitration disputes concerning alleged breaches of obligations under Part III of the ECT.528 It further contends that Article 21 of the ECT does not create obligations concerning tax measures and that the provisions of Law 15/2012 regarding the TVPEE constitute a tax measure for the purposes of the ECT.529 Steag, however, claims that the TVPEE is part of a maneuver by the Respondent against it and must be analyzed in conjunction with other legislative provisions and the effects produced by the tax, which it characterizes as a \"*composite measure*\" in violation of the FET standard.530\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 110-113; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 206 et seq. and 290.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 125.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 141-144; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 285.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 110-113.\n\n317.\n\nIn light of the parties' arguments, the Tribunal must first determine whether the TVPEE qualifies as a tax measure and whether it is excluded from the scope of the ECT. Second, it must establish whether the creation of the tax through Law 15/2012 constitutes an act of bad faith.\n\n318.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 21(1) of the ECT is a \"*carve-out*\" provision that exempts fiscal measures from the scope of the ECT.531 This interpretation is based on the text of the ECT and the decision in *Plama Consortium v. Bulgaria.*532 The Claimant agrees with the Respondent that the TVPEE qualifies as a \"*tax measure*\"; however, it contends that such measures are not categorically excluded under Article 21 of the ECT.533\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 110, 111.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 135; *Plama Consortium Ltd. v.

In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\"\n\n320.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, establishing that a measure is of a tax nature is sufficient for the carve-out provision to apply.534 The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the wording of Article 21(1) indicates that \"*taxation measures*\" are excluded from the ECT. In resolving this objection, it is therefore to determine whether the TVPEE qualifies as a \"*taxation measure*.\"\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 219 et seq.\n\n321.\n\nAs previously noted, both parties affirm in their submissions that the TVPEE is a \"*taxation measure*.\"535 The Respondent bases its argument on the assertion that the TVPEE is a tax clearly defined and regulated under both national and international law.536 It further points out that international arbitral tribunals in cases such as *EnCana v. Ecuador, Duke Energy v. Ecuador, and Burlington Resources v. Ecuador* have established criteria for determining whether a measure is tax-related.537 According to the Respondent, the TVPEE meets the three essential characteristics of a tax, namely:538 \"*(i) It is established by law; (ii) It imposes an obligation on a group of persons; and; (iii) It requires payment of a sum of money to the State*.\"539 For its part, Steag argues that the TVPEE is part of a series of bad-faith decisions and actions by Spain that drastically altered the RRO, thereby affecting its investment.540\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 111; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 142; Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 114-116; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 211-218.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 145-150 and 164.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 169-172, citing *EnCana Corp. v.

The preamble of the law explicitly states:\n\n\"The purpose of this Law is to align our tax system with more efficient and environmentally friendly energy use and sustainability. [\u2026] through this Law, three new taxes are established: the tax on the value of electricity production, the tax on spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste resulting from nuclear power generation, and the tax on the storage of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste in centralized facilities.\"542\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 142 et seq.\n\nLaw 15/2012, Preamble [**CL-0024**].\n\n324.\n\nFurthermore, Article 8 establishes that \"*the tax shall be levied at a rate of 7 percent*.\" The Tribunal has no doubt that the purpose of this regulation is to impose tax burdens on various actors in the renewable energy sector. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the TVPEE is a \"*tax measure*\" enacted in accordance with Spanish law.543\n\nThe legislative process and approval of Law 15/2012 by the Spanish Congress of Deputies and the Senate is public and can be consulted in detail on the official websites of the Congress and Senate [**R-0034**]; Judgment 183/2014 of the Full Court of the Constitutional Court, Constitutional Appeal No. 1780-2013 (November 6, 2014) [**R-0043**].\n\n325.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with the criteria set forth by the arbitral tribunals544 cited by the Respondent, which serve as indicators for determining, beyond national law, whether a measure constitutes a tax. The TVPEE also aligns with these criteria.\n\n*EnCana Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador*, Award, LCIA Case No. UN 3481 (February 3, 2006), \u00b6 142 [**RL-0027**]; *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners et al. v.

The Respondent discusses these cases in its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 169-172.\n\n326.\n\nIn its submissions, the Claimant invokes the doctrine of \"*composite measure*,\"545 developed by some tribunals in cases such as *El Paso c. Argentina*546 y *Swisslion c. Macedonia,*547 and requests that the Tribunal analyze the TVPEE as part of a \"*composite measure*\" by Spain, which allegedly violates the FET standard.548\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 117.\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v.

Republic of Macedonia*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/16 (July 6, 2012). \u00b6 275 [**CL-0089**].\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 117.\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal finds two reasons to reject the application of the \"*composite measure*\" doctrine as suggested by the Claimant: *First*, a tax is typically part of a broader set of legislative or administrative measures that may collectively impact an investment. However, this does not mean that the tax itself, as an act of the State, merges with those other measures to become part of a \"*composite measure*\" and \u2014 thereby - losing its tax nature. *Second*, the Tribunal does not find any compelling evidence in the record that establishes a \"*connection*\" between the measures adopted by the State or demonstrates the negative impact of the alleged \"*composite measure*\" on Steag's investment. The Claimant describes the \"*composite measure*\" doctrine but fails to explain how it applies to this case.\n\n328.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Tribunal concludes that the TVPEE is a \"*taxation measure*\" under Spanish law and in accordance with the criteria set out other tribunals. The TVPEE falls within the definition of \"*taxation measure*\" provided for in Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT.\n\n329.\n\nRegarding the argument that the TVPEE is a taxation measure adopted in bad faith, the Claimant asserts that, under Article 21 of the ECT, only taxation measures adopted in good faith can \"*benefit from the defense that investment protection agreements afford to tax measures*.\"549\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 123\n\n330.\n\nThe Claimant, citing the awards in *Antin v. Spain*550 and *Antaris Solar v. Czech Republic*,551 urges the Tribunal not to limit itself to the formal characterization of the TVPEE by the State.552 Spain, in turn, maintains that the TVPEE is a tax adopted in good faith,553 as it establishes a uniform tax base,554 does not discriminate against taxpayers,555 and serves the purpose of raising public revenue.556 The Kingdom of Spain maintains that, to determine whether the TVPEE was adopted in good faith, the Tribunal should only conduct an analysis of legal issues and not of the economic effects of the \"*taxation measure*.\"557\n\n*Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. et al. v.

This Tribunal must now determine whether the tax created under Law 15/2012 was adopted in good faith or, as the Claimant alleges, was \"*designed with the specific objective to covertly reduce remuneration under the Original Regulatory Regime*.\"558\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 144.\n\n332.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the burden of proving that the State did not act in good faith when introducing the TVPEE through Law 15/2012 falls on the Claimant. As a general rule, the party making an allegation must prove it. Steag was therefore required to demonstrate that the TVPEE was not designed to serve Spain's general interest but rather had a malicious objective aimed at harming investments in the sector. The standard for rebutting the presumption of good faith is high. As the tribunal stated in Isolux v. Spain, \"*[i]t is not easy to rebut the presumption that the taxation measures enacted by a State are bona fide*.\"559 Likewise, in Antin v. Spain, the tribunal stated:\n\n\"It is well established in international law that an abuse of right claim is subjected to a high threshold of proof. The Tribunal must therefore determine if the TVPEE was adopted by Spain with the precise aim of abusing its rights under the ECT, by strategically creating the TVPEE to curtail the investors' alleged rights under the Treaty, in a manner that abusively sought to employ the taxation exclusion.\"560\n\n*Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands BV v.

Original text: \"*It is well established in international law that an abuse of right claim is subjected to a high threshold of proof. The Tribunal must therefore determine if the TVPEE was adopted by Spain with the precise aim of abusing its rights under the ECT, by strategically creating the TVPEE to curtail the investors' alleged rights under the Treaty, in a manner that abusively sought to employ the taxation exclusion*\". *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. et al. v.

Steag failed to demonstrate that Spain's intent in introducing the TVPEE was different from what is stated in the preamble of the Law, as cited above. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the analysis of the arbitrators in *Isolux v. Spain*:\n\n\"[\u2026] The economic repercussions or effects of the TVPEE may be unclear and debatable, but that does not constitute sufficient grounds to conclude that the TVPEE is a tax measure enacted in bad faith.\n\nIt is possible that this tax measure does not have the intended environmental impact and that its enactment served no purpose other than to reduce the tariff deficit, as claimed by the Claimant. However, the Arbitral Tribunal does not need to rule on this issue because, if the real purpose of the measure was merely to raise revenue \u2014 as the Claimant argues \u2014 this would align with the legitimate purpose of any tax, without allowing it to be characterized as a bad faith taxation measure. If it were true that the State presented a purely revenue-generating measure as an environmentally friendly measure, the conclusion would remain the same. It is the actual purpose of the measure that must be assessed by the Tribunal, not its cosmetic presentation, which may be explained by political motives that fall outside the scope of the Arbitral Tribunal's analysis.\"561\n\n*Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands BV v. Kingdom of Spain*, Award, SCC Case No. V 2013/153 (July 12, 2016), \u00b6\u00b6 739, 740 [**RL-0003**].\n\n334.\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal concludes that it lacks jurisdiction to rule on the alleged violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT through the introduction of the TVPEE under Law 15/2012.\n\n**C. The objection regarding the Tribunal's** ***ratione temporis*** **jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this Tribunal lacks *ratione temporis* jurisdiction.562 The Respondent preliminarily notes that while the Memorial of Claim identifies June 8, 2012, as the date of investment, Steag's experts indicate that the investment was carried out in stages between 2012 and 2014.563 Spain alleges that: ***(i)*** as of the investment date indicated in the Memorial of Claim, the dispute was foreseeable and already in existence; and ***(ii)*** if the dates provided in the expert report are considered, a significant portion of the investments took place when the dispute had already crystallized in enacted measures.564 The Respondent seeks to demonstrate that, when making its investment, Steag was aware that, by the first half of 2013 at the latest, Spain would implement measures affecting all operators in the electricity system and altering the existing remuneration model for renewable energy sources, without prejudice to the guarantee of \"*reasonable return*.\"565\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 840 et seq.; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 311 et seq. and 335.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 840, referring to \u00b6 9 and Section C.II of the Memorial of Claim, and Section II, \u00b6 7, of the Brattle Expert Report on economic damages.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 840-842; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 319.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 841; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 318.\n\n336.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the ECT protects only those investors who can demonstrate that they held an investment before the dispute arose.566 Citing arbitral decisions and academic writings, the Respondent asserts that there is no *ratione temporis* jurisdiction when, after a dispute has arisen, an investor restructures its investment to gain access to the protection of a BIT.567\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 844; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 320.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 845.

Australia.577* According to the Respondent, that decision clarifies that the relevant moment for a *ratione temporis* objection is \"*when the measures become concrete*.\"578\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 850; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 325, 326.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 850.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 850.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 851-857.

Claimant's Position\n----------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's *ratione temporis* objection \"*is based on a self-serving interpretation of government announcements related to various macroeconomic issues*\" and only makes sense if there is a \"*complete lack of understanding*\" of the financing structures behind projects such as Arenales Solar.601 Steag contends that the objection is baseless and should be dismissed.602\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 134, 135.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 136; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 173, 216.\n\n349.\n\nFirst, the Claimant explains that \"*the 'ratione temporis' objection is in reality an unfounded allegation of abuse of rights*.\"603 Steag argues that a distinction must be drawn between an ICSID Tribunal's *ratione temporis* jurisdiction and the \"*ratione temporis* applicability\" of the treaty's protection standards.604 The Claimant notes that a *ratione temporis* objection typically concerns the temporal application of a BIT and focuses on whether the dispute arose before the BIT's entry into force or whether any clause limits the temporal application of the treaty's guarantees.605\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 136-137 et seq. See also Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 214, et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 138.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 139.\n\n350.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's assertions, Steag maintains that \"*Article 2 of the ECT does not impose any temporal limitation on the protections granted under the treaty*.\"606 The Claimant argues that Spain alleges an abuse of rights and *treaty shopping*, calling Steag's good faith into question but failing to specify what the alleged abuse consists of.607 The Claimant points out that, unlike in *Philip Morris v. Australia*, Steag's investment was not restructured after the dispute arose in order to secure the treaty's applicability: Steag is a good-faith investor.608\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 140.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 141; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 214, 215.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 142; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 215, 216.\n\n351.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent's objection assumes that the contested measures had been announced and were foreseeable *before* the investment was made.609 Therefore, it is essential to determine two key dates: ***(i)*** the moment the dispute arose, which Steag claims coincides with the approval of the TVPEE on December 27, 2012; and ***(ii)*** the date the investment was made, which Steag states was June 8, 2012.610\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 143.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 174.\n\n352.\n\nRegarding the **emergence of the dispute**, Steag argues that the dispute arose with the approval of the measures,611 and that \"*the mere announcement of contested measures does not, therefore, give rise to a dispute*.\"612 The Claimant explains that multiple arbitral awards, including those cited by Spain, confirm that the \"*critical date*\" coincides with the approval of the contested measures.613 According to the Claimant, the \"*critical date*\" is therefore December 27, 2012, when the TVPEE was approved \u2014 after SMAG acquired its shares.614\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 143. Regarding the date on which the dispute is considered to have arisen, Steag (\u00b6 143) cites the case *Philip Morris Asia Ltd. v. Commonwealth of Australia*, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, PCA Case No. 2012-12 (December 17, 2015), \u00b6 533 [**RL-0037**].

Canada*, Award, UNCITRAL Case (September 15, 2011), \u00b6\u00b6 323-325 [**RL-0079**]. The Claimant considers that the case *Phoenix Action*, also cited by Spain, is not relevant to the present case (\u00b6 184).\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 145; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 174.\n\n353.\n\nThe Claimant contends that even if this Tribunal were to conclude that the announcement of the measures marked the beginning of the dispute, none of the Spanish government's announcements constituted a \"*clear, forceful, and unequivocal notice of the Measures*.\"615 Steag explains that the core of the Respondent's argument is that \"*the Measures were foreseeable to any diligent investor*.\"616 However, Steag finds Spain's argument inconsistent. On one hand, in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, Spain implies that the dispute arose with the Sustainable Economy Law (\"**LES**\") of March 4, 2011.617 If that were the case, the relevance or necessity of the alleged announcement of the measures during the December 2011 elections would be unclear.618 On the other hand, Spain shifts its argument by suggesting that the dispute arose on March 7, 2012, with the CNE Report, in an attempt to show that the dispute pre-dated the investment.619 Steag notes that: (***i***) the new government's announcements only referred to reducing the tariff deficit and not to the \"*drastic change*\" that was to come; and ***(ii)*** the CNE Report mentioned adjustments to the RRO, whose effect was neutral, but did not refer to the measures adopted between 2013 and 2014.620\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 146.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 147.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 147, referring to \u00b6\u00b6 618-623 of the Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 147, 148, and 162.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 149, 150.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 151.\n\n354.\n\nThe Claimant provides a timeline of its investment decisions, beginning in autumn 2011, when it first made contact with SMAG regarding a potential investment in Arenales Solar, and ending on July 31, 2012, when the SPA and other agreements between Steag and SMAG were made public.621 Steag concludes that the investment decision was made in good faith, at a time when the measures had not yet been announced.622 Steag sets out three main arguments.623\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 152.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 153, 178.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 154.\n\n355.\n\n*First*, the Claimant asserts that the LES only established \"*guiding principles*\" consistent with the 1997 Electricity Sector Law (LSE) and did not introduce the NRR, nor did it suggest any alteration to the remuneration regime.624 Steag argues that the LES aimed to \"*deepen the indicative planning model*\" already applied under the RRO.625 The 2012 LES sought to expand the share of concentrated solar power and other renewable energies in Spain's energy mix, in line with the targets set for 2020.626 After analyzing the 2012 LES, Steag concludes that it cannot be interpreted as an announcement of the subsequent reform.627\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 154-157.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 157. The Claimant refers in this context to the Preamble of the LSE of 1997.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 158, 159. In this context, the Claimant references Article 79(3) of the LES of 2012.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 160, 161. Steag specifically refers to Article 79(4) of the LES, which sets out the legislative principles for Government measures (\u00b6 160).\n\n356.\n\nSecond, Steag explains that \"*[b]etween late 2011 and mid-2012, the Spanish Government merely announced its intention to eliminate the tariff deficit without specifying how it would do so*.\"628 In his 2011 investiture speech, President Rajoy \"*did not define what strategy his administration would adopt regarding the tariff deficit, beyond stating that it would seek to reduce system costs*.\"629 Steag acknowledges that the new President recognized the complexity of the issue and stated that tariff increases should not fall entirely on consumers, but argues that the President's remarks did not rule out the adoption of measures different from those ultimately implemented.630\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 154 and 163 et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 163.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 163-165. The Claimant cites examples of these alternatives: (***i***) adjusting the increase in SEE (Electricity System) access tolls; (***ii***) introducing changes to ensure long-term system sustainability by increasing investment in renewable energy, reducing CO2 emissions and environmental costs; (***iii***) introducing tax measures that do not focus solely on electricity producers; or (***iv***) increasing competition among electricity producers to foster efficiency.\n\n357.\n\nSteag highlights that *\"[t]he lack of definition regarding the measures to be taken was a constant in the following months\" and refers to the milestones that, according to the State, signaled the measures, namely: (i) the CNE press release of December 28, 2011, on the elimination of the tariff deficit; (ii) Royal Decree-Law 1/2012 of January 27, 2012; (iii) Royal Decree-Law 13/2012 of March 30, 2012; and (iv) the National Reform Program approved on April 27, 2012*.*\"*631 Steag asserts that these measures, as such, \"*did not affect concentrated solar power (CSP) plants*.\"632 The Claimant states that it welcomed the fact that CSP remained \"*outside the scope of regulatory changes*\", which was consistent with Royal Decree 661/2007, Royal Decree 1614/2010, the objectives set out in the 2011-2020 National Renewable Energy Action Plan, as well as the Summary of the 2011-2020 Renewable Energy Plan.633\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 166.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 167, 168.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 168-170.\n\n358.\n\nSteag argues that between late 2011 and mid-2012, the Respondent had not only not yet announced the New Remuneration Regime (NRR), at least with respect to CSP, but that its measures indicated continuity in the policies adopted for this sector.634 In its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimant maintains that, in any case, in its most recent submissions, the Respondent abandoned its arguments regarding the LES of 2011 and other actions from 2011 having announced the measures, thereby placing the emergence of the dispute at the time of the publication of the CNE Report in March 2012.635\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 171.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 172.\n\n359.\n\n*Third*, the Claimant argues that the CNE Report from March 2012 suggested measures whose scope and principles were very different from those that led to the NRR in 2013 and 2014.636 For Steag, the Report, prepared by an independent body and considered non-binding by the Government, merely proposed \"*minor adjustments to the Original Regulatory Regime*\", which also respected investments in CSP plants.637 Steag explains that Spain rejected those recommendations, partly due to the impact their announcement had on the stock market, and even stated that certain measures would not be adopted.638 The Claimant contends that the implementation of the NRR began with the approval of the TVPEE on December 27, 2012, at which point Steag had already made its investment, and not with the CNE Report.639\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 154, 172 and 173; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 191.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 174-177.

Tribunal's Analysis\n----------------------\n\n366.\n\nUnder the heading of its *ratione temporis* objection, the Respondent essentially argues that \"*the dispute predates the alleged acquisition of the investment by the Claimant*.\"670 Steag opposes the Respondent's argument, emphasizing that Spain disregards the nature of project finance structures, such as the one used for Arenales Solar.671 In addition to explaining in detail the structure of the investment it claims to have made, the Claimant asserts that Spain's objection does not actually relate to the Tribunal's *ratione temporis* jurisdiction but rather constitutes an abuse of rights objection.672\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 880.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 141; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 202 - 213.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 141; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 214 et seq.\n\n367.\n\nIn light of the arguments presented by the parties, the Tribunal will first examine its *ratione temporis* jurisdiction as such and will then rule on the Respondent's objections concerning abuse of rights.\n\n3.1. The tribunal's *ratione temporis* jurisdiction\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nWith regard to the *ratione temporis* objection, the Parties' arguments have focused on determining the date of the investment and the date on which the dispute arose.673 It is undisputed that the investment was not made before June 8, 2012.674 The issues in dispute are whether a controversy already existed at that time and whether, as the Respondent has suggested, the capital injections made between 2012 and 2014 qualify as \"*successive investments*\" that must be analyzed separately.675\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 840, et seq.; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 319, et seq.; Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 143, et seq.

Republic of El Salvador*, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12 (June 1, 2012), \u00b6 2.101 [**RL-0084**]; *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v.

Republic of Peru*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/17 (January 9, 2015), \u00b6 146 [**CL-0096**].\n\n370.\n\nBased on the above, the central question before the Tribunal for the purposes of the *ratione temporis* jurisdictional objection is the following: Did a protected investment exist when the dispute concerning the investment arose?\n\n371.\n\nThe first step in answering this question is determining the date on which the investment was made. The Tribunal finds that the investment was made on June 8, 2012. The Respondent characterizes the capital injections made by Steag after that date as additional \"*investments*.\"679 However, the project structure, based on the evidence presented, does not support Spain's argument.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 878-880.\n\n372.\n\nThe Claimant has explained and demonstrated in a detailed and satisfactory manner not only that the acquisition of Arenales Solar was structured through a project finance scheme but also the obligations undertaken by Arenales Solar's shareholders (sponsors), including the obligation to maintain a specific DSCR.680 As is typical in project finance structures, the loan repayment was to be made using Arenales Solar's cash flows. However, the obligations assumed by the shareholders (sponsors) required them to make additional capital contributions with each disbursement of the approved credit.681 If the cash flows of the special purpose vehicle were insufficient to service the debt, the shareholders (sponsors) would be required to provide additional funds in accordance with the terms and conditions stipulated in the contracts forming part of the project finance structure.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 190, 191.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 191-194.\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the fact that the shareholders (sponsors) and lenders agreed to a scheme requiring additional capital injections does not mean that each capital injection constitutes a new investment. The investment is a single one \u2014 the acquisition of SMAG's shares in Arenales Solar on June 8, 2012. The additional capital injections correspond to the fulfillment of contractual obligations within the same project, which were undertaken before the NRR was introduced. They are therefore not new \"*investments*\". All contributions fall within a single transaction.\n\n374.\n\nThe economic structure of an operation may result in different capital injections over an extended period, without necessarily implying the existence of multiple independent investments. In this case, Steag made multiple capital injections as part of a single project, beginning on June 8, 2012.682 That is the date of the investment. Furthermore, regardless of the classification of later capital injections as \"*investments*,\" the parties do not dispute that Steag made an investment on June 8, 2012.\n\nSee Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 195, et seq.\n\n375.\n\nA separate matter is the relevance of the commitments that Steag undertook after June 8, 2012, for the purpose of determining the Claimant's legitimate expectations and any damages suffered as a result of the alleged ECT violation. However, this is a merits issue rather than a jurisdictional one and will be addressed when discussing the merits of the case.\n\n376.\n\nThe second step, taking June 8, 2012, as the date of the investment, is to determine whether a dispute concerning the investment had already arisen by that time.\n\n377.\n\nThe relevant portion of Article 26 of the Treaty, regarding disputes that may be submitted to arbitration, states that they are those disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III (\"*Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III*\").683\n\nECT, art. 26 [**RL-0006**].\n\n378.\n\nThe Treaty does not define what constitutes a \"*dispute*.\" However, in its natural sense, the word \"*dispute*\" implies a disagreement or conflicting opinions between two or more parties. As the PCIJ stated in the *Mavrommatis* case, a dispute is \"*a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between two persons*.\"684 In general terms, a dispute cannot exist if one party has made a statement, declaration, or taken a position on facts or law, and the other party has not expressed any opposition or disagreement.\n\nThe Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, *Greece v. United Kingdom*, CPJI/PCIJ, Ser. A. No 2, (1924) p. 11 [**RL-0024**] [Tribunal's Translation].\n\n379.\n\nThe disputes that may be submitted to arbitration under Article 26 of the Treaty are disputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party \"*relating to Investments*\" of the latter and concerning the \"*alleged breach*\" of obligations under Part III of the ECT. It follows that not every dispute, nor every \"*disagreement on a point of law or fact*\" between the parties, can be submitted to arbitration under the Treaty. To qualify as a \"*dispute*\" within the meaning of Article 26 of the ECT, the disagreement must arise in connection with the Claimant's investments in the Respondent's territory and must relate to alleged violations of obligations under Part III of the Treaty.\n\n380.\n\nBased on the above, and in accordance with Article 26 of the Treaty, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to rule on the dispute between the Parties only if the dispute arises from a claim of Treaty violation related to the Claimant's investment in Spain. Any dispute arising from alleged breaches of the Treaty concerning Steag's investment, but which arose before the Claimant acquired Arenales Solar, would not fall within the Tribunal's *ratione temporis* jurisdiction.\n\n381.\n\nSpain has sought to demonstrate that the dispute arose with the publication of the CNE Report on March 7, 2012.685 According to the Respondent, a series of announcements had been made regarding the measures being prepared, and the controversy \"*crystallized*\" with the issuance of the aforementioned CNE Report. Even the Claimant acknowledges that the measures it claims were announced in 2011 and early 2012 were not approved until December 2012, with Law 15/2012.686\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 875.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 312.\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Respondent's argument is unpersuasive. The Tribunal reiterates that a dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact or a conflict of legal positions or interests between two parties. The Respondent's unilateral statements, which were neither objected to nor discussed by the Claimant, cannot be considered expressions of disagreement on a factual or legal point for these purposes. A dispute between Spain and Steag only arises once Spain adopts a measure. It is the adoption of the measure that affects the rights and interests of the investor, who may then oppose it. Until such a measure is enacted, there is no state act capable of causing harm. An announcement is not a legal act and does not impact in any way the rights or legal positions of the affected parties. Such an effect can only be produced by acts that generate legal consequences under the applicable legal framework, which, in this case, is Spanish law. There is no dispute between Steag and the Respondent prior to the date of the investment. Neither the CNE Report nor the acts that \"*announced*\" the measures alter this conclusion.\n\n383.\n\nFurthermore, the dispute must arise in connection with the Claimant's investments in the Respondent's territory and must relate to alleged breaches of obligations under Part III of the Treaty. The Claimant has made no allegation that any events prior to June 8, 2012, could potentially constitute a violation of the ECT in relation to the Arenales Solar project.\n\n384.\n\nThe Claimant is therefore correct in asserting that, for the purposes of *ratione temporis* jurisdiction, the decisive factor is not the *announcement* of the measures but their *approval.*687 The foreseeability of the measures at the time the investment was made is certainly relevant for assessing the investor's legitimate expectations and may therefore impact the success of its claims on the merits. However, the presence or absence of those expectations does not affect the existence of a protected investment for the purposes of the Tribunal's *ratione temporis* jurisdiction. The mere announcement of a measure does not raise a retroactivity issue in the application of the treaty and, therefore, cannot be equated with the adoption of a measure for jurisdictional purposes. A mere announcement is not a legal act; it does not impact in any way the rights or legal positions of the affected parties. Only legal acts produce such an effect. In *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy v. Peru*, the tribunal stated:\n\n\"The determination of the critical date is therefore essential to establishing the Tribunal's *ratione temporis* jurisdiction. In the Tribunal's view, the critical date is the date on which the State adopts the contested measure, even when that measure represents the culmination of a process or series of events that may have begun years earlier.\"688\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 145; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, 175, et seq.; *Vito G.

Allegations of abuse of rights\n-----------------------------------\n\n387.\n\nAs part of its objection to the Tribunal's *ratione temporis* jurisdiction, the Respondent also suggests that Steag may have engaged in an abuse of rights.689 Emphasizing that the timing of the dispute is \"determinative\" in establishing such abuse,690 Spain argues that \"*Steag's supposed investment took place precisely when the conflict had already arisen*.\"691 The Claimant, in turn, contends that the Respondent has failed to specify in what way Steag allegedly abused its rights.692 In this regard, the Claimant is correct.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 867-871.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 867-871.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 865, 866.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 141; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 214, 215.\n\n388.\n\nThe objection of lack of *ratione temporis* jurisdiction is conceptually distinct from an abuse of rights objection.693 In the present case, the Respondent has not put forward an abuse of rights objection that is sufficiently distinct from its arguments concerning the lack of *ratione temporis* jurisdiction, nor has it presented facts or evidence to substantiate such an objection. It is merely a suggestion embedded within the claim of lack of *ratione temporis* jurisdiction.\n\nSee *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador*, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12 (June 1, 2012), \u00b6 2.101 [**RL-0084**].\n\n389.\n\nThe burden of proving that Steag committed an abuse of rights and, in doing so, acted in bad faith, rests with the Respondent. As recognized by the tribunal in *Philip Morris v. Australia*, the standard that a State alleging abuse of rights must meet is high.694 The Tribunal finds that Spain has not met this burden.\n\n*Philip Morris Asia Ltd. v. Commonwealth of Australia,* Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, PCA Case No. 2012-12 (December 17, 2015), \u00b6\u00b6 539, 550 [**RL-0037**].\n\n390.\n\nAbuse of rights is closely linked to the requirement of good faith on the part of the investor.\n\n391.\n\nIn the present case, there is no indication that Steag held an \"*unprotected*\" investment before June 8, 2012, and that it structured its investment solely for the purpose of gaining access to jurisdiction under the ECT without being entitled to it. No aspect of the 2012 transaction suggests that Steag abused its rights. Moreover, as previously stated in relation to *ratione temporis* jurisdiction, before June 8, 2012, no measure had been adopted that affected Steag's interests. There is even less reason to suggest an abuse of rights before that date.\n\n392.\n\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not proven that the Claimant engaged in an abuse of rights. This does not preclude the possibility that events prior to June 8, 2012, may be relevant in assessing the investor's expectations when analyzing the merits of the dispute, particularly concerning the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n393.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects the *ratione temporis* objection and the allegations of abuse of rights raised by the Respondent.\n\n**D. Objection to the admissibility of the claim regarding the alleged violation of article 13 of the ECT (expropriation) through the introduction of the TVPEE**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n394.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the claim concerning the alleged violation of Article 13 of the ECT (expropriation) through the introduction of the TVPEE is inadmissible.695 The Respondent emphasizes that Article 21 of the ECT establishes that the Treaty does not create rights or obligations regarding tax measures (the \"taxation carve-out\"), except for the cases listed in that provision (the \"claw-backs\").696 Under Article 21(5)(a) of the ECT, Article 13 of the ECT (expropriation) is one of these exceptions.697\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 204 et seq.; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 291 et seq.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 207.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 208-210.\n\n395.\n\nHowever, arbitration of such claims is subject to certain requirements. Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT requires that issues relating to the expropriatory or discriminatory nature of a tax must first be submitted to the competent tax authority, either by the investor or, if the investor does not do so, by the Arbitral Tribunal.698 The term \"*competent tax authority*\" is defined in Article 21(7)(c) of the ECT as \"*the competent authority under a double taxation treaty in force between the Contracting Parties*.\"699 In the absence of such an agreement, the term is understood to refer to \"*the minister or ministry responsible for taxation or their authorized representatives*.\"700 The competent tax authority must seek to resolve the matter within six months of the submission of the request, after which the issue may be submitted to arbitration.701 The Respondent emphasizes that this requirement is mandatory, as evidenced by the use of the word \"*someter\u00e1*\" (shall submit) in Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT.702\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 205, 216 and 217; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 292.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 212.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 212.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 205, 218 and 219.

Republic of Bulgaria*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24 (August 27, 2008), \u00b6 266 [**RL-0034**].\n\n396.\n\nThe Respondent states that it has no knowledge of Steag having submitted the issue of the alleged expropriatory effect of the TVPEE to the competent tax authority.703 The Respondent specifically refers to Steag's communication to the President of the Spanish Government, the Minister of Economy and Competitiveness, and other senior officials, dated May 12, 2014.704 The Respondent notes that \"*this letter is merely a Trigger Letter in which Steag requests that the Spanish Government enter into negotiations to attempt to reach an amicable resolution to the dispute*.\"705 The Respondent emphasizes that the letter does not contain a request concerning the alleged expropriatory effects of the TVPEE for the purposes of Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT, a provision that is not even mentioned in the letter.706 Indeed, the letter refers to a violation of the ECT \"in general\" through Law 15/2012, without specifically mentioning either Article 13 of the ECT or the TVPEE.707 The Respondent concludes that Steag could not expect the competent authorities to engage in \"*a guessing exercise*\" to understand that they were being asked for a ruling on the alleged expropriatory nature of the TVPEE.708 Finally, Spain argues that the letter was not sent to the Minister of Finance and Public Administration or to their authorized representative, who was the competent tax authority for the purposes of Article 21(7)(c) of the ECT, in accordance with Article 3(1)(g) of the Double Taxation Treaty between Germany and Spain.709\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 206, 211 and 220.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 295, et seq., referring to Exhibit **C-0005.**\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 297.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 300.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 301-304.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 305.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 306.\n\n397.\n\nConsequently, the Respondent requests that this Tribunal***: (i)*** declare the inadmissibility of the claim regarding the alleged expropriatory effect of the TVPEE; *and **(ii)*** if the Claimant fails to comply with its obligation to submit the matter to the competent national tax authority, refer the issue to that authority for a ruling within the time frame established in Article 21(5) of the ECT.710 The Respondent also reserves the right to present arguments on this issue once the matter has been submitted to the aforementioned tax authority.711\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 221, 222; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 307-310.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 223.\n\n2. Claimant's Position\n----------------------\n\n398.\n\nRegarding the Respondent's argument under Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT, the Claimant states that it sent a letter to the Spanish Government on May 12, 2014, seeking to reach an amicable settlement of the dispute.712 In that letter, the Claimant asserts, \"*Steag already indicated that the TVPEE could constitute a violation of the protections granted to investors under Part III of the ECT*.\"713 The Claimant emphasizes that these protections include not only the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT but also the expropriation clause in Article 13 of the ECT.714\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 128, 129; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 166.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 130.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 130.\n\n399.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that it has complied with its obligation to submit the matter to the competent tax authority.715 The Minister of Economy and Finance is the competent authority of the Kingdom of Spain under Article 3(1)(g) of the Double Taxation Treaty between Germany and Spain and must therefore be considered the \"*competent tax authority*\" for the purposes of the ECT, in accordance with Article 21(7)(c) of the Treaty.716 Steag provides a list of the officials to whom the letter was sent.717 The Claimant explains that, although the letter was not sent to the Minister of Finance and Public Administration, it was sent to the President of the Government, who is the Minister's superior.718 The Claimant also asserts that the letter was received, inter alia, by the Minister of Economy and Competitiveness.719\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 113, 133.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 132, referring to Article 3(1)(g) of the Double Taxation Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Kingdom of Spain (February 3, 2011) [**CL-0094**].\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 131.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 169, 170.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 132; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 169.\n\n400.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's assertions that the communication was not explicit enough and was not addressed to the competent authority \"*amount to mere formalism*\" and serve as a \"*distraction to obscure reality*.\"720 Steag contends that its letter clearly referred to Law 15/2012 and that, among the measures established by that Law, only the TVPEE could affect solar thermal energy producers.721\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 166, 167.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 168.\n\n3. Tribunal's Analysis\n----------------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal declare the claim regarding the alleged expropriatory effect of the TVPEE inadmissible, arguing that the Claimant failed to fulfill its obligation to submit the matter to the \"*competent tax authority*,\" as required by Article 21(5) of the ECT.722 According to Spain, the \"*competent tax authority*\" never received such a request from the Claimant.723 Steag contends that it did fulfill its obligation to submit the issue of the alleged expropriatory effect of the TVPEE to the \"*competent tax authority*\" of the Kingdom of Spain.724 The Claimant asserts that it sent the relevant letter to the President of the Government, who is the hierarchical superior725 of the Minister of Economy and Competitiveness.726 Steag further argues that the Respondent's allegations regarding non-compliance with procedural requirements \"*are mere formalism*\" and constitute a clear \"*distraction to obscure reality*\" before the Tribunal.727\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 221, 222; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 307-310.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 205, 216 and 217; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 292.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 113, 133.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 169, 170.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 132; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 169.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 166, 167.\n\n402.\n\nArticle 21(5)(b) of the ECT provides:\n\n\"Where a dispute arises as to whether a tax constitutes an expropriation under Article 13, or as to whether a tax alleged to constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the following provisions shall apply:\n\ni) The Investor of the Contracting Party alleging such expropriation shall submit the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether it is discriminatory to the competent tax authorities. If neither the Investor nor the Contracting Party submits the issue, the bodies to which disputes are referred under Article 26(2)(c) or Article 27(2) shall submit the issue to the competent tax authority.\"\n\n403.\n\nThere is no dispute between the parties regarding the requirement under Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT to submit matters concerning the alleged expropriatory or discriminatory nature of a tax to the \"*competent tax authorities*.\" Nor is it contested that the TVPEE is a tax. Therefore, the Tribunal must resolve two issues: First, whether the letter effectively \"*submitted the issue*\" of the alleged expropriatory nature of the tax to the authority. Second, whether the letter was indeed sent to the \"*competent tax authority*\" designated to address the request.\n\n404.\n\nRegarding the first issue, the Tribunal finds that the letter of May 12, 2014, does not meet the requirement set forth in Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT. The provision clearly states that issues concerning the expropriatory nature of a tax must be \"*submitted*\" to the competent tax authority. The letter, however, begins by stating that its purpose is \"*to notify the existence of a breach by the Kingdom of Spain of [its] obligations toward Steag under Part III of the ECT*.\"728 It then proceeds to explain the \"*origins*\" of the alleged breach, attributing it to regulatory changes in Spain's tax framework that directly affected Steag's investments in the renewable energy sector:\n\n\"The breach originates in the regulatory changes affecting the financial regime applicable to thermosolar power plants, which were introduced through various regulations: Law 15/2012 of December 27 on fiscal measures for energy sustainability (\"Law 15/2012\"); Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 of February 1 on urgent measures in the electricity system and financial sector (\"RDL 2/2013\"); Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 of July 12, which adopts urgent measures to ensure the financial stability of the electricity system (\"RDL 9/2013\"); Law 24/2013 of December 26 on the Electricity Sector (\"LSE\"), and its subsequent implementing regulations, currently available as a draft (the future Royal Decree regulating the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, cogeneration, and waste; and the future Order of the Ministry of Industry, Energy, and Tourism approving the remuneration parameters for standard facilities applicable to certain electricity production facilities based on renewable energy sources, cogeneration, and waste).\"729\n\nLetter for an amicable settlement sent by Steag to the Kingdom of Spain, dated May 12, 2014 [**C-0005**].\n\nLetter for an amicable settlement sent by Steag to the Kingdom of Spain, dated May 12, 2014 [**C-0005**].\n\n405.\n\nSteag concludes by alleging that the regulatory changes violate the standards of treatment and protection offered by the Kingdom of Spain to investors under the ECT. The letter cites Article 26(1) of the ECT as the basis for \"*calling upon*\" the competent authority of the Spanish Government to seek an amicable resolution to the dispute.\n\n406.\n\nIt is evident that the communication makes no reference to Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT. The letter does not contain the word \"*expropriation*\" anywhere. There is no indication in the text that the senders intended to consider the tax as expropriatory or that they sought to \"*submit the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation*\" to the authorities.\n\n407.\n\nThe general rule of interpretation set out in Article 31 of the VCLT requires that a treaty be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with the \"*ordinary meaning*\" of its terms. The key term in this case is \"*submit*\". The Tribunal must determine whether Steag effectively \"*submitted*\" the issue of the expropriatory nature of the tax to the competent tax authorities of the Kingdom of Spain. This means assessing whether, in its communication, the Claimant requested that those authorities rule on or clarify the alleged expropriatory nature of the TVPEE. The language used in the document does not reflect a formal notification aimed at prompting the recipients to assess whether the proposed tax could be considered expropriatory. The recipient of the letter could not reasonably understand or infer, based on its text, that they were being asked to initiate the process set forth in Article 21(5) of the ECT.\n\n408.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the above is already sufficient to conclude that the Claimant did not submit the issue of the expropriatory nature of the TVPEE to the competent tax authority. However, the Tribunal will also address Spain's second argument. On this point, the Tribunal notes that Article 21(7)(c) of the ECT730 states:\n\n\"[C]ompetent tax authority\" means the competent authority under a double taxation treaty in force between the Contracting Parties or, where no such treaty is in force, the Minister or Ministry responsible for taxation or their authorized representatives.\"\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 132, referring to Article 3(1)(g) of the Double Taxation treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Kingdom of Spain (February 3, 2011) [**CL-0094**].\n\n409.\n\nFrom Article 21(7)(c), it follows that, in this case, the \"*competent tax authorities*\" are those designated under the bilateral double taxation treaties concluded between the Kingdom of Spain and the Federal Republic of Germany.731 The Claimant submitted to the record the \"*Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital*\" (Exhibit **CL-094**), concluded between Spain and Germany. Article 3(1)(g) of the Convention states that the \"*competent authority*\" in Spain is \"*the Minister of Economy and Finance or their authorized representative*.\"732\n\nInstrument of Ratification of the Treaty between the Kingdom of Spain and the Federal Republic of Germany for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Tax Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, and its Protocol, executed in Madrid on February 3, 2011 [**CL-0094**].\n\nInstrument of Ratification of the Treaty between the Kingdom of Spain and the Federal Republic of Germany for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Tax Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, and its Protocol, executed in Madrid on February 3, 2011 [**CL-0094**].\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the requirements of Article 21(5)(b) may be satisfied by a letter, provided that it is properly formulated and addressed to the Respondent's competent tax authority. Thus, it would be sufficient for a Claimant to \"*submit*\" the issue of the expropriatory nature of the TVPEE to the Minister of Finance of Spain.\n\n411.\n\nIn the Reply on the Merits and Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, as well as the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimant asserts that it sent a letter to the Spanish Government on May 12, 2014, seeking an amicable resolution to the dispute.733 It reiterates that the letter was sent to the President of the Government, as the hierarchical superior within the Spanish State structure.734 However, nothing indicates that the letter was addressed to the Spanish Minister of Finance\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 128, 129; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 166.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 131; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 169.\n\n412.\n\nThe term \"*competent tax authority*\" is explicitly defined in the ECT, which expressly and unequivocally refers to a \"*double taxation treaty in force between the Contracting Parties.*\" Since such an agreement exists between Spain and Germany and provides a clear definition of \"*competent tax authority*,\" it is that authority \u2014 and no other \u2014 to whom the relevant request must be submitted. This Tribunal cannot overlook the plain and unequivocal wording of the ECT. It is not sufficient for Steag to have sent a communication to any official within the Spanish State structure, regardless of their seniority. Moreover, the Claimant has not presented a clear argument that would allow the Tribunal to conclude that any of the officials who received the May 12, 2014 letter qualify as the \"*competent tax authority*\" under the ECT.\n\n413.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant has not demonstrated that its May 12, 2014 letter was sent to a \"*competent tax authority*,\" as defined in the ECT and as designated under the Double Taxation Treaty between Spain and Germany. Furthermore, the content of the letter itself does not indicate that the Claimant was requesting the authority to assess the potential expropriatory effects of a fiscal measure.\n\n414.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant did not submit the issue of the alleged expropriatory nature of the 7% tax on electricity production, established under Law 15/2012, to the \"*competent tax authority.*\" As a result, it failed to comply with the procedural requirement set out in Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT. Accordingly, the claim regarding the alleged violation of Article 13 of the ECT through the introduction of the TVPEE is deemed inadmissible.\n\n415.\n\nThe Tribunal declines to independently refer the issue of the TVPEE's expropriatory nature to the Spanish authority, as doing so would cause an unnecessary delay in resolving the matters before this Tribunal. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant's arguments under Article 13 of the ECT pertain to the RRO as a whole and do not present a sufficiently differentiated argument regarding the expropriatory nature of the TVPEE specifically. In any event, a determination by the Spanish authority would not alter the Tribunal's conclusions reached in paragraphs 679 and 680 of this decision. The Tribunal emphasizes that, consequently, a decision by the Spanish Minister of Economy and Finance or their authorized representative would not lead to a different outcome in these proceedings.\n\n**VIII. MERITS OF THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Fair and Equitable Treatment (Article 10(1) of the ECT)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Claimant's Position\n----------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimant analyzes the fair and equitable treatment (**FET**) standard as an element of Article 10(1) of the ECT.735 The Claimant asserts that the FET standard includes at least three elements: the protection of fundamental legitimate expectations that motivated the investment,736 the obligation to act in good faith,737 and the prohibition of discriminatory or exorbitant measures.738\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 206. Steag observes that the FET standard derives from general international law and highlights its \"*generality and lack of precision,*\" while recognizing that its meaning has been progressively developed and refined through arbitral practice (\u00b6\u00b6 206, 207, 215, and 216).\n\nMemorial of Claim, particularly in \u00b6\u00b6 206, 210-216.

See also \u00b6\u00b6 234, 243.\n\n422.\n\nEssentially, the Claimant argues that through RD 661/2007, the 2010 ER Communication, and RD 1614/2010, the State created the expectation that \"*the remuneration of the Arenales Project would not be substantially and unjustifiably modified*.\"760 In Steag's view, the NRR frustrated these expectations by replacing the guaranteed tariffs with the reasonable return ratio.761 Additionally, Steag contends that the State breached commitments made to investors under the final paragraph of Article 10(1) of the ECT, as it deprived pre-assigned installations of the premiums and tariffs set out in RD 661/2007, thereby violating the guarantee derived from the 2010 ER Communication and RD 1614/2010.762 Finally, Steag asserts that the lack of \"*economic justification*\" for the TVPEE also constitutes a breach of the good faith requirement and the prohibition of discrimination, meaning that this tax measure\u2014regardless of its compliance with domestic law\u2014is contrary to the ECT.763\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 223.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 222, 223.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 237, 238.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 239, 240.

United Mexican States*, Arbitral Award, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1 (December 16, 2002) [**RL-0072**]. Regarding the conformity of the measure with domestic law, the Claimant references the cases *Feldman v. Mexico and OEPC v. Ecuador*.\n\n423.\n\nThe issue is not the evolution of the regulatory regime, but rather its \"*arbitrary modification*\" and the alleged frustration of investors' expectations, which in its view constitutes a violation of the FET standard.764 The Claimant argues that the NRR is exorbitant and cannot be justified by the tariff deficit,765 as the State's response to the deficit should have been reasonable and consistent with the ECT.766 Steag asserts that the 2013 and 2014 reforms were unreasonable and drastic.767 Furthermore, Steag alleges that Spain did not act in good faith.768 Ultimately, Steag argues that Spain attracted investors with favorable conditions and, once the sector had been developed, \"*radically*\" altered the regulatory regime.769\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 233.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 229.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 229, 235.

Steag repeatedly states that his expectation was never to freeze the RRO.770 The Claimant explains that, at the time of its investment, Spain had followed a public policy of promoting renewable energy for fifteen years.771 Under the ECT, Steag argues that Spain has a duty of transparency regarding its regulatory regime,772 a duty that forms part of the context for assessing investors' expectations.773 The State must act consistently toward investors, giving them the opportunity to \"*know in advance what the State's policy will be in the area relevant to their investment*.\"774 Steag also highlights that the stability required by the ECT differs from similar concepts in domestic law, meaning that the Spanish Supreme Court's classification of the measures as non-retroactive is irrelevant.775\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 229.

After a detailed review of Spain's legal framework on the matter, the Claimant concludes that these successive changes \"*were not intended to better align revenues and costs in the Spanish electricity system*.\"817 Instead, Steag asserts, \"*[t]hey were aimed at attracting new investors to the market.*818\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 302, et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 303-305.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 305.

The Claimant places particular emphasis on p. 16 of the CNE Report 3/3007 regarding the draft royal decree regulating electricity production activity under the special regime and certain assimilated technologies of the ordinary regime, dated February 14, 2007 [**CL-0017**].\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 324, citing \u00b6\u00b6 101-103 of the Brattle Report [**C-0003**], pp. 22, 23 of the CNE Report 3/2007 [**CL-0017**], pp. 13, 14 of the RD 661/2007 Project Memorandum [**R-0065**], and p. 4 of the Report by the Technical General Secretariat of the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Tourism [**C-0048**].\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 325.\n\n435.\n\nThe Claimant acknowledges that RDL 6/2009 introduced changes to the RRO that could impact solar thermal plants, but notes that the rule applied \"*only to future plants and those under development*.\"825 According to Steag, this RDL sought to \"*stagger the commissioning of plants to better match different electricity demand scenarios*.\"826 Steag argues that once the tariff deficit issue was identified, Spain chose to uphold its interpretation of the RRO, ensuring legal certainty and creating the pre-assignment register, without affecting the RD 661/2007 remuneration regime.827 From the Claimant's perspective, the pre-assignment registry provided the opportunity to \"*modulate the commissioning of power plants in line with renewable energy targets and the absorption capacity of installed capacity*.\"828 Steag believes that the pre-assignment resolution for Arenales Solar confirms this function of the register.829 The Claimant contends that the changes introduced by RDL 6/2009 aimed to \"*protect investors and promote renewable energy investments,*\" even though the tariff deficit was already a known issue.830\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 326.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 327, referring at this point to Exhibit **C-0049**.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 328.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 328.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 329, citing Exhibit **C-0009**\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 330.\n\n436.\n\nThe Claimant notes that in 2010, Spain modified the remuneration regime for photovoltaic solar energy, a reform analyzed in *Charanne*, where the tribunal found that the reform preserved the \"*essential characteristics*\" of RD 661/2007.831 Steag argues, however, that these changes did not affect solar thermal energy, as confirmed by RD 1614/2010 and the 2010 ER Communication.832 Similarly, RDL 14/2010 did not affect solar thermal plants, as it only applied to photovoltaic plants, in line with the prevailing regulatory regime.833 For Steag, the \"*only*\" significant change affecting solar thermal production came with RDL 1/2012, which impacted new installations but preserved the rights of those registered in the pre-assignment register.834 According to the Claimant, this confirms that Spain understood that registration in the pre-assignment register could generate legitimate expectations.835\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 331.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 332-335, also referring to \u00b6 114 of Exhibit **C-0003**. Steag highlights the consistency of this measure with the objective of promoting renewable energy and cites p. 82 of an article by Prof. Cayetano Espejo Mar\u00edn [**CL-0105**]. In this context, the Claimant (\u00b6\u00b6 333, 334) makes a detailed reference to the Preamble of RD 1614/2010.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 336-338, referring particularly to Additional Provision One of RDL 14/2010.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 339, 340.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 340.\n\n437.\n\n***Third***, Steag asserts that Arenales Solar was designed with a capacity of less than 50 MW to ensure it was covered under RD 661/2007.836 This, according to Steag, aligns with the findings of the CNMC inspection on June 1, 2015.837\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 342, et seq., particularly \u00b6 345. The Claimant refers to Spain's arguments regarding the plant's capacity in \u00b6\u00b6 342-344. According to the Claimant, the Respondent itself has acknowledged this point in various documents (\u00b6 345), citing pp. 1, 6, and 105 of the Plant Execution Project [**C-0051**]; the November 23, 2007 resolution by the Regional Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Enterprise of the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda [**C-0052**]; the letter from Arenales Solar dated October 14, 2009, regarding the pre-assignment registry [**C-0053**]; the project's technical description dated May 12, 2011 (particularly pp. 31, 71-72, and 84) [**C-0054**]; the EPC Contract, Clause 3.1 [**C-0013**]; and the administrative resolutions provided in Exhibit **C-0055**. See also \u00b6 348.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 346, 347, citing pp. 1-2, 4, 5, 9, 32, and 33 of Exhibit **C-0056**.\n\n438.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent created the expectation that there would be no drastic regulatory change concerning solar thermal power plants included in the pre-assignment register \u2014 an expectation reinforced by RD 1614/2010 and RDL 1/2012 \u2014 which was a fundamental factor in the decision to invest in Arenales Solar.838 Steag explains that an expectation can arise not only from contractual commitments but also from unilateral declarations or the regulatory regime itself.839 The Claimant suggests that its expectations stemmed from the *due diligence* process conducted prior to the investment, and that these are protected under the final paragraph of Article 10(1) of the ECT.840\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 349, et seq. and 353.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 349-351. Steag also refers here to Spain's arguments on the protection of investors' legitimate expectations.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 352.\n\n439.\n\nDeveloping this argument, the Claimant contends that the umbrella clauses in investment agreements protect not only contractual obligations but also \"*commitments implicitly assumed by a State through its political and regulatory conduct*.\"841\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 354. Steag conducts a detailed analysis of arbitral decisions and academic writings related to the umbrella clause in \u00b6\u00b6 354-370. These arguments will be considered in the section related to Steag's claims under the umbrella clause.\n\n440.\n\nSteag asserts that Spain's statements indicated that changes to solar thermal energy tariffs would not affect existing plants and would apply only prospectively.842 According to the Claimant, despite successive adjustments to the RRO, the Respondent \"*was unable to attract the necessary investment for the development of its energy policy*.\"843 This, in its view, explains why it made unilateral commitments in 2007 and 2010, and why the regulatory changes progressively increased the remuneration offered to renewable energy producers.844 The elements Spain needed to achieve its sectoral objectives included: Introducing a minimum and maximum remuneration, setting a premium for the operational life of the plants, and establishing a methodology for revising the premium.845 These policies, by making cash flows more predictable, enabled investments in the sector to rely on project finance structures.846 Finally, Steag emphasizes that Spain actively promoted its regulatory regime worldwide, inviting investment in the sector.847\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 371, et seq., particularly \u00b6\u00b6 373, 374.

Steag suggests that the RAIPRE and RDL 6/2009 sought to control the \"*registration flow*\" and explains that the State \"*decided to protect this sector [solar thermal energy] with great technological potential from the changes that did occur in the photovoltaic energy sector*\" (\u00b6 380).\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 381, citing pp. 13, 14 of Exhibit **CL-0113.** See also Steag's analysis of the purposes of Article 2 of RD 1614/2010 (\u00b6 382), citing pp. 23, 24 of the CNE Report on the draft Royal Decree regulating and modifying certain aspects of the special regime, dated September 14, 2010 [**CL-0114**]. Later, Steag cites an academic article referring to the interrelation between RD 1614/2010 and RDL 6/2009, authored by Prof. Pere Mir [**CL-0115**] (\u00b6 383).\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 384, 385, citing Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 and the Regulatory Impact Analysis Report of the RD 1614/2010 Project [**R-0066**].\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 386, citing Exhibit **CL-0021.** In support of its argument, Steag (\u00b6\u00b6 387, 388) also cites pp. 28, 29 of the 2011 IDAE analysis (Exhibit **CL-0116**).\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 389.\n\n442.\n\nThe Claimant states that, based on the Respondent's conduct and the *due diligence* conducted by Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Abogados, \"*it relied on the stability of the regulatory framework*.*\"*854 The Claimant contends that RD 1614 and the moratorium established by RDL 1/2012 led Steag to believe that the RRO would remain in force for Arenales Solar,855 as reflected in Steag's internal documents.856 According to the Claimant, the moratorium played a key role in the investment decision,857 since during the pre-investment phase, it guaranteed the continuity of the RD 661/2007 remuneration regime, a guarantee that constituted \"*the only relevant milestone affecting solar thermal power producers*.\"858 Arenales Solar was registered in the pre-assignment register, a factor that Steag considered an indication that its investment was \"*on the safe side of the fence*.\"859\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 390.

The Claimant cites here p. 3 of the internal document regarding the first offer [Exhibit **C-0038**], which considered the moratorium for pre-registered projects under RDL 6/2009. The Claimant also refers (\u00b6 392) to pp. 8-9 of the April 25, 2012 presentation for Steag's team analyzing the investment project [**C-0040**].\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 393-395, citing in \u00b6 393 Steag's internal summaries of the project, from April 27 and May 25, 2012 (Exhibit **C-0057**) (particularly pp. 6, 7). Steag then refers to the context of the moratorium in \u00b6\u00b6 396-398, citing the Preamble and Articles 4.5 and 4.8 of RDL 6/2009, as well as the Resolution of the Secretary of State for Energy on the organization of projects registered in the pre-assignment registry [**CL-117**].\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 407.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 399-404. The Claimant (\u00b6\u00b6 401, 402) refers to the minutes of Steag's supervisory body, which recorded discussions on the pre-registration, particularly citing pp. 15-17 of Exhibit **C-0058** and pp. 6, 7 of Exhibit **C-0041**. The Claimant states that, in contrast, the statements that \u2014 according to the State \u2014 announced the measures from December 2012 were merely \"*empty statements*\" (\u00b6 406).\n\n443.\n\nSteag therefore argues that Spain created legitimate expectations, which are protected under the FET standard.860 The Claimant further asserts that, even if legitimate expectations were not covered by the FET standard, it would still protect investors from \"*unreasonable and inconsistent*\" regulatory changes.861\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 408-411.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 409.\n\n444.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Spain violated \"*its obligation to promote a stable legal framework*\" and the protection afforded against \"*illogical and inconsistent measures*.\"862 At the heart of its argument is the claim that the measures introduced by Spain \"*lack any rational political justification*.\"863\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 415, 416. In this context, the Claimant refers *extensively* to the State's arguments regarding the claims based on Article 10(1) of the ECT (\u00b6\u00b6 412, et seq.), summarizing Steag's claims (\u00b6 413) and the State's arguments (\u00b6 414).\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 415.\n\n445.\n\nThe Claimant begins by explaining that some of the awards on which the Respondent relies to justify the NRR did not concern solar thermal energy.864 Additionally, Steag notes that *Charanne* did not analyze RD 1614/2010.865 *AES Summit v. Hungary* dealt with facts that were significantly different from the present case.866 The Claimant also briefly refers to the proportionality test in *Electrabel.*867 Steag observes that the award in *Eiser* was the first to analyze the situation in the solar thermal energy sector.868 The Claimant also refers to the decision in *Novenergia II*, which, although it concerned investments in photovoltaic energy, recognized that the reforms introduced from RDL 9/2013 were radical, unexpected, and had a significant impact on investors.869 The key question, then, is whether the measures were \"*reasonable, logical, and proportionate*.\"870 Steag argues that they were not, citing four reasons.871\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 417-432, referring to the awards *AES Summit Generation Ltd. et al. v.

Steag adds that Spain has not explained the revenues of the SEE and the combination of regulated and free-market prices, focusing solely on the system's costs (\u00b6 450).\n\n448.\n\nSteag explains that, in the proportionality and reasonableness analysis under the FET standard, the specific case must be examined, so that \"*this case does not involve a judgment on the entirety of the Spanish electricity system, but rather its specific impact on the concentrated solar power sector*.\"880 The Claimant finds that the Respondent has not provided a concrete analysis: it has not explained the causes of the deficit or the reasons why the alternative measures proposed by The Brattle Group were rejected.881 Rather, Steag argues, the Respondent sought to avoid the \"*electoral cost*\" of introducing prices that reflect the cost of electricity.882\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 453.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 454.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 454.\n\n449.\n\nThe Claimant highlights that Spain's advisory consultations regarding the NRR, conducted by the Boston Consulting Group and Roland Berger, took place after the measures were adopted and were clouded by alleged pressure from the Ministry of Industry to ensure that the results reflected what the Respondent wanted.883 For these reasons, the Claimant asserts, it is clear that the measures were neither proportional nor logical, nor were they supported by truly independent advisory assessments.884\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 455. The Claimant analyzes this advisory in detail in \u00b6\u00b6 456-458 and the dissatisfaction of the Ministry of Industry with the results of the advisory, citing Exhibits **C-0059**, **C-0060**, and **C-0061.** The Claimant notes that the Ronald Berger Report did not take into account, for example, the LSE 2013, and suggests that its conclusions were \"*adjusted to the figures that Spain wanted them to reflect*\" (\u00b6 458), citing Exhibit **C-0062**.

Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n453.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Spain highlights two central points.903 The first point is that the burden of proving a violation of the FET standard rests with the Claimant.904 The second point is that the guarantees provided under the ECT must be interpreted in light of the treaty's teleology.905 For the Respondent, \"*[t]his prevents Investor protection from becoming an absolute value, overriding the State's general interest needs and even those of nationals, whether they be consumers or domestic investors*.\"906\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 882, 883.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 882, citing *Electrabel S.A. v.

In the Counter-Memorial (\u00b6\u00b6 881 et seq.), Spain emphasizes that the Memorial of Claim omitted the analysis of national regulations, Spanish Supreme Court rulings, sections of CNE reports, and various statements from sector actors, which, in Spain's view, \"*determine that the Kingdom of Spain has not violated the FET standard*\" (\u00b6\u00b6 884, 885). The Respondent also notes that the Memorial of Claim bases its analysis primarily on awards concerning breaches of state contracts but omits important decisions specifically addressing the ECT (\u00b6\u00b6 886, 887).

In no case shall such investments be accorded treatment less favorable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations [...].\"1073\n\nECT, art. 1 [**RL-0006**] (emphasis added).\n\n500.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting that, as pointed out by the Respondent, the burden of proving a violation of the FET standard lies with Steag.1074 The Claimant's arguments can be divided into two main points:\n\n(i) The first concerns the alleged violation of the standard due to the frustration of Steag's legitimate expectations.1075 The Claimant contends that RD 661/2007, the 2010 ER Communication, and RD 1614/2010, together with the registration of the Arenales Project in the pre-assignment registry, created an expectation that there would be no unjustified substantial changes to the project's remuneration.1076 The investor could not have foreseen fundamental changes to the system.1077 The Respondent allegedly breached this expectation by adopting the NRR, which led to \"*the abolition of guaranteed tariffs for electricity production and their replacement with the New Regulatory Regime, which provides for a 'reasonable return' ratio as Steag's investment remuneration*.\"1078\n\n(ii) The second argument is that, under the ECT, the FET standard includes a guarantee of stability.1079 In this regard, Steag asserts that: \"*Even if it were understood that the fair and equitable treatment standard corresponds to an international minimum that does not include the protection of investors' legitimate expectations, it certainly protects against drastic changes that are unreasonable and inconsistent, for which it will be necessary to take into account precisely the legitimate expectations generated for the investor*.\"1080\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 882.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 233.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 223, 237 and 238.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 247.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 222.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 231, 232; Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 229 et seq. and 239 et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 409.\n\n501.\n\nThe Tribunal will now analyze each of these arguments separately.\n\n3.1. Steag's Legitimate Expectations\n------------------------------------\n\n502.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the frustration of a protected investor's legitimate expectations may constitute a violation of the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that this is one of the core functions of the FET standard.1081\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary*, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, and Liability, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19 (November 30, 2012), \u00b6 7.75 [**RL-0002**].\n\n503.\n\nHowever, not every expectation of an investor is relevant for establishing a violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT.1082 The concept of \"*legitimate expectations*\" has been refined in numerous arbitral decisions regarding Article 10(1) of the ECT. In general, these decisions have indicated that expectations must be objectively established, exist at the time of the investment, and be based on the State's positive conduct.1083\n\n*RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Ltd. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Decision on Liability and the Principles for Quantum Assessment, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30 (November 30, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 260, 261 [**RL-0140**].\n\n*Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. et al. v.

Czech Republic*, Final Award, PCA Case No. 2014-13 (October 11, 2017), \u00b6\u00b6 407, 411 [**RL-0100**].\n\n504.\n\nFor the purposes of this case, the first step is to determine which actions of the Respondent were capable of generating a legitimate expectation regarding Steag's investment as of the investment date, i.e., June 8, 2012 **(a)**. It is also necessary to establish to what extent the State's conduct was a decisive factor in Steag's decision to invest in Spain, which requires examining the investor's conduct and the information it knew or should have known at the time of the investment **(b)**. If the Tribunal finds that there is an objective basis for the formation of legitimate expectations and that the acts capable of generating expectations played a role in the decision to invest in Spain, the Tribunal must then determine what Steag's expectations actually were, i.e., their scope **(c)**. Once this analysis is complete, the Tribunal must assess the extent to which the adoption of the NRR frustrated those expectations **(d)**.\n\n*a) Acts of the Respondent Capable of Generating Legitimate Expectations Regarding Steag's Investment*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n505.\n\nThere is a degree of consensus that the creation of legitimate expectations requires acts attributable to the State that are objectively capable of generating those expectations. However, there is debate as to whether those acts must necessarily consist of specific representations to one or more particular investors or under what conditions general measures can give rise to legitimate expectations.1084\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary*, Decision on jurisdiction, applicable law, and liability, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19 (November 30, 2012), \u00b6 7.76 [**RL-0002**]; *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8 (September 11, 2007), \u00b6 331 [**CL-0033**].\n\n506.\n\nSome tribunals constituted under the ECT have found that, although the elements of a regulatory regime may be directed at certain specific investors, \"*this does not make them commitments specifically addressed to each of them*.\"1085 It has been argued that *\"[c]onverting a regulatory rule, by virtue of the limited number of persons subject to it, into a specific commitment made by the State to each of these subjects, would constitute an excessive limitation on the ability of States to regulate the economy in the public interest*.*\"*1086\n\n*Charanne BV et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Final Award, SCC Case No. V 062/2012 (January 21, 2016), \u00b6 493 [**RL-0049**].\n\n*Charanne BV et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Final Award, SCC Case No. V 062/2012 (January 21, 2016), \u00b6 493 [**RL-0049**].\n\n507.\n\nOther tribunals have found that the regulatory framework in highly regulated industries can give rise to legitimate expectations. In *Cube Infrastructure v. Spain*, the tribunal explained:\n\n\"The Tribunal does not find it necessary for a specific commitment to have been made to each individual claimant for a legitimate expectation to arise. At least in the case of a highly regulated industry, and as long as the representations are sufficiently clear and unequivocal, it is sufficient that a regulatory regime is established with the manifest purpose of attracting investments, offering potential investors the prospect that their investments will be subject to a set of regulatory principles that, as a deliberate policy, will remain in force for a finite period of time. Such regimes are clearly designed to create expectations, which investors will rely on; and insofar as those expectations are objectively reasonable, they give rise to legitimate expectations when investments are actually made based on them.\"1087\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal.

Such regimes are plainly intended to create expectations upon which investors will rely; and to the extent that those expectations are objectively reasonable, they give rise to legitimate expectations when investments are in fact made in reliance upon them*\").

But neither can it be affirmed, as a general rule, that legal norms cannot generate legitimate expectations or crystallize specific commitments. Everything depends on the specific case. An investor's expectations may arise from administrative acts, legislative provisions, contracts, or other acts attributable to the State, or a combination thereof, depending on the circumstances of the case.1088 When legal norms give substance to particular and specific administrative acts, the commitment may arise from the combination of both. The existence or absence of a specific commitment should not be examined through an abstract discussion on the legislative, administrative, or contractual nature of the relevant acts. What is fundamental is whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, there are acts attributable to the State that, individually or collectively, could generate a specific expectation in the investor.\n\nSee 1404 *Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. v. The Czech Republic*, Award, UNCITRAL Case (November 12, 2010), \u00b6 285 [**CL-0111**].\n\n509.\n\nThis Tribunal finds that, in the specific case of Steag, as presented before this Tribunal, it is not necessary to address the debate on whether a specific legal or regulatory provision can create a legitimate expectation. There is no dispute that a specific commitment by the State to an investor can create a legitimate expectation, and in the case of Arenales Solar, the Tribunal finds that there were specific acts by the Spanish State relating to the project which, within the context of the relevant legislation, were capable of generating legitimate expectations. Specifically, the Spanish State issued a resolution in favor of Arenales Solar registering it in the pre-assignment register for remuneration, which constitutes a particular and concrete administrative act rather than a general legal or regulatory norm. This administrative act, applicable only to its recipient, explicitly, specifically, and unequivocally stated that the installation would benefit, under the terms and conditions established in the applicable regulatory framework, from the economic regime of RD 661/2007.\n\n510.\n\nThe Resolution of Registration of Arenales Solar is, therefore, a specific act that expresses a specific commitment by the Spanish State. Steag is correct in asserting that the register was capable of generating legitimate expectations:1089\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 340.\n\n511.\n\nTo begin with, the very title of the resolution indicates that it had effects beyond a mere administrative registration: \"*Resolution of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines by which the installation ARENALES, whose owner is ARENALES SOLAR PS, S.L., is registered in the Pre-Assignment Register for Remuneration, **granting it the regulated economic regime under Royal Decree 661/2007, dated May 25***.\"1090\n\nResolution of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines registering the ARENALES facility, owned by ARENALES SOLAR PS, S.L., in the Pre-Assignment Register, granting it the regulated economic regime under Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, 2007 [**C-0009**]; (emphasis added).\n\n512.\n\nThe rationale section of the resolution explicitly states: \"*In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of the fifth transitional provision of the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law [RDL 6/2009], **the economic regime of installations registered in the Pre-Assignment Register for Remuneration pursuant to the provisions of the fourth transitional provision of the same, shall be as provided in Royal Decree 661/2007**, dated September 26*.\"1091\n\nResolution of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines registering the ARENALES facility, owned by ARENALES SOLAR PS, S.L., in the Pre-Assignment Register, granting it the regulated economic regime under Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, 2007 [**C-0009**]; (emphasis added).\n\n513.\n\nThe legal effects of a particular and specific administrative act, such as this resolution, depend on the legislation within which the act in question was issued. This is why the significance of this specific representation can only be understood through a comprehensive reading of the legal framework applicable to the pre-assignment remuneration register.\n\n514.\n\nArticle 9 of RD 661/2007 requires the registration of special regime production installations in what was called the \"*Administrative register of special regime production installations*.\"1092 Section 4 of RDL 6/2009 establishes the \"*Pre-Assignment Register for the Special Regime*.\"1093 The Tribunal observes that various provisions of RD 1614/2010 express the relevance and effects of registration in the RAIPRE and the pre-assignment register for solar thermal power plants (see Arts. 2.3, 2.4, 4). The Parties dispute the function of this register.\n\nRD 661/2007, art. 9 [**CL-0018**; **R-0084**].\n\nRDL 6/2009, section 4 [**CL-0020**; **R-0072**].\n\n515.\n\nFor Spain, the register served a mere administrative function; it was a \"*mandatory administrative register*\" that had no significance beyond being a \"*regulatory requirement for obtaining subsidies*.\"1094 For Steag, when the Spanish State faced the tariff deficit, the pre-assignment register was used to maintain legal certainty for investors; the register modulated the start of plant operations, taking into account the capacity to absorb installed power.1095 Steag argues that RDL 6/2009 also aimed to protect investments in renewable energy.1096 For the investor, there was an expectation of stability derived from registration in the pre-assignment register.1097\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 912.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 328.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 330.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 379, 380.\n\n516.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept Spain's position that it was merely a \"*regulatory requirement for obtaining subsidies.*\"\n\n517.\n\nThe pre-assignment register cannot be analyzed in isolation but within the legal framework under which it was created and considering the successive regulatory provisions adopted by Spain after its creation.1098\n\nIn other ECT cases, it has already been concluded that registration in the RAIPRE was not a mere \"*administrative requirement*\" but entailed significant legal consequences. *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31 (June 15, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 552 [**CL-0130**].\n\n518.\n\nSpecifically, Article 2 of RDL 1/2012, dated January 27, 2012, suspended the pre-assignment remuneration processes but explicitly protected installations that had already been registered or were in the process of registration.\n\n\"Article 2. Scope of application.\n\n1. This Royal Decree-Law shall apply to the following installations:\n\na) Those special regime installations that, at the date of entry into force of this Royal Decree-Law, **had not yet been registered in the Pre-Assignment Register for Remuneration, as provided in Article 4.1 of Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, of April 30**, which adopted certain measures in the energy sector and approved the social bonus.\n\nb) Those special regime photovoltaic technology installations that, at the date of entry into force of this Royal Decree-Law, had not yet been registered in the Pre-Assignment Register for Remuneration, as provided in Article 4.1 of Royal Decree 1578/2008, of September 26, on the remuneration of electricity production activities through photovoltaic solar technology for installations after the deadline for maintaining the remuneration of Royal Decree 661/2007, of May 25, for said technology.\n\n[...]\n\n2. This Royal Decree-Law **shall not apply to special regime installations that had submitted an application for registration in the Pre-Assignment Register for Remuneration** when the corresponding resolution deadline, under the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of Article 42 of Law 30/1992, of November 26, on the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and Common Administrative Procedure, had already expired at the date of its entry into force\".1099\n\nRDL 1/2012, Art. 2 [**R-0074**] (emphasis added).\n\n519.\n\nThe registration resolution for Arenales Solar, therefore, carries a meaning that goes far beyond the mere certification of compliance with an administrative requirement. Within the regulatory framework of Spanish law, the registration materializes the promise of providing a certain degree of stability in the economic regime applicable to the installation. Spain, through the express terms of the Arenales Solar registration resolution, \"*granted the regulated economic regime under Royal Decree 661/2007*.\"1100 The rules governing the final registration under RD 661/2007 and the pre-assignment registration under RDL 6/2009, collectively, made it reasonable to infer that this resolution ensured a certain level of protection against future changes. RDL 1/2012 and RD 1614/2010 confirmed this interpretation and, as will be seen later, clarified the scope of this guarantee.\n\nResolution of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines registering the ARENALES facility, owned by ARENALES SOLAR PS, S.L., in the Pre-Assignment Register, granting it the regulated economic regime under Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, 2007 [**C-0009**].\n\n520.\n\nWhen the State grants an investor a specific status through a particular and concrete administrative act, which domestic law endows with certain legal effects, the combination of the administrative act and the rules that give it substance can generate legitimate expectations. In such cases, the expectation does not arise from general legislation considered in isolation, but rather from a particular act to which legislation attributes specific legal effects. In a situation like the present one, where the administration directly addressed a specific party (Arenales Solar) through a registration resolution, and the legislature itself defined the effects of that administrative declaration, there is a clear and solid basis for the formation of legitimate expectations. Given that these acts generate legal effects under the law of the host State, it could be argued that such a situation creates an even stronger commitment than a mere non-binding statement or communications between an investor's representatives and a State official.\n\n521.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, according to Spain, the pre-assignment register could not generate legitimate expectations because it might be incompatible with the EU State aid regime. The Tribunal finds that such a potential incompatibility does not prevent the Spanish State's positive acts described above from giving rise to a legitimate expectation.\n\n522.\n\nFirstly, there is no decision from an EU body clearly indicating that the RRO violates EU law. Moreover, if there were a contradiction with EU law, it would imply that the Spanish State had failed to comply with its obligations under EU law. Under the principle of good faith in international law, the State cannot be allowed to use its own unlawful conduct as a means to escape liability under the FET standard; *nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans*. Furthermore, Steag is correct in arguing that the duty to conduct due diligence before making an investment does not require anticipating an international violation.1101\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 255.\n\n*b) The relevance of Steag's conduct and due diligence before the investment date in determining the existence and scope of legitimate expectations*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n523.\n\nFor the purposes of the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT, an investor's legitimate expectations must be determined not in abstract terms but in light of the specific circumstances surrounding the investment decision and at the time of the investment itself. In addition to the existence of State acts capable of generating an expectation, it must be demonstrated that these acts actually motivated the investment or, at the very least, were considered in the investment decision.\n\n524.\n\nThis analysis involves establishing what information the investor knew or should have known at the time of making the investment. The investor cannot rely on subjective expectations arising from a negligent lack of knowledge of the applicable regulatory framework. In this sense, the investor bears the burden of adequately informing itself about the circumstances of the location where it intends to invest.\n\n525.\n\nIn *Parkerings v. Lithuania*, the tribunal explained:\n\n\"The investor will have a right of protection of its legitimate expectations provided it exercised due diligence and that its legitimate expectations were reasonable in light of the circumstances. Consequently, an investor must anticipate that the circumstances could change, and thus structure its investment in order to adapt it to the potential changes of legal environment.\"1102\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal.

Spain,* \"[...] *an investor cannot be expected to conduct an extensive legal investigation. What is important in determining whether the expectations claimed by the investor are reasonable is what any prudent investor must know about the regulatory framework before investing and the actual information available to the investor invoking specific expectations*.\"1106\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Spain), \u00b6 71.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Spain), \u00b6 69.\n\n*Isolux Infrastructure Netherlands BV v.

The Tribunal notes that the reports by Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf and Cuatrecasas emphasized the importance of the pre-assignment registration for the economic regime that would apply to Arenales Solar.\n\n529.\n\nThe Consolidated Report by Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf, dated June 5, 2012, highlights the importance of Arenales Solar's pre-assignment registration as a condition that, if other requirements were met, would allow it \"***to obtain the guaranteed feed-in tariffs according to RD 661/2007** of May 25*.\"1107 The Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Report indicates that certain benefits of the RRO were expected to be maintained.1108 The Cuatrecasas Report also considers the pre-assignment of the Arenales Solar project under the terms of RDL 6/2009 and states that if the requirement for final registration was met before January 1, 2014, \"***it will be able to receive the remuneration regime established in Royal Decree 661/2007**, of May 25, which regulates the activity of electricity production under the special regime (\"RD 661/2007\")* [\u2026].\"1109\n\nArenales Solar PS, S.L. \u2013 Due Diligence \u2013 Executive Summary, Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Abogados, June 5, 2012 [**C-0031**] (emphasis added).\n\nSee also Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 278, referring to Exhibit **C-0031**.\n\nLegal Audit Report: Proyecto Termosolar Arenales Solar PS, S.L., Cuatrecasas, Gon\u00e7alves Pereira S.L.P., of July 26, 2011 [**C-0017**] (emphasis added).\n\n530.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that two different law firms (Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf and Cuatrecasas) reached the same conclusion in their due diligence reports: that Arenales Solar's registration in the pre-assignment register was a source of regulatory stability relevant to the investment.1110\n\nSee Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 248 et seq., 251-252, and 265; Post-Hearing Brief \u2013 First Round (Steag), \u00b6\u00b6 55 et seq.\n\n531.\n\nThese reports also highlight the importance given to other laws that developed the special economic regime, such as RDL 6/2009, RD 1614/2010, and especially the moratorium under RDL 1/2012.1111 Indeed, as the Claimant points out, these reports indicate: (***i***) the relationship between the design of the Arenales Solar Plant (with a capacity of less than 50 MW) and the objective of ensuring the application of RD 661/2007;1112 ***(ii)*** the relevance of the pre-assignment register for Steag's decision to invest in Arenales Solar;1113 and ***(iii)*** access to these reports before June 8, 2012.1114\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 283.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 340, et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 281, 349 et seq. and 399 et seq.

The Claimant has explained that the reports were submitted for consideration as part of the internal assessments presented to Steag's governing bodies.1115 Mr. Voswinkel emphasized that the pre-assignment register was one of the key aspects of Steag's investment process.1116 Referring to the purpose of the legal due diligence that was carried out, Mr. Voswinkel stated: *\"From our perspective, what we analyzed was the foundation of the feed-in tariff system: whether there had been changes, or not, and **what the situation was at the time we were about to invest, as well as how it would develop in the future.

The investment date marks a fundamental difference compared to the factual circumstances analyzed by various tribunals under the ECT. Within the context of the SEE and the measures adopted by Spain after Royal Decree 661/2007, investing in 2009 is not the same as investing in 2012. To determine what expectations Steag could have had in June 2012, it is first necessary to consider the evolution of the applicable regulatory framework up to that point.\n\n534.\n\nThe Tribunal has established that obtaining the resolution for registration in the pre-assignment register1118 could generate legitimate expectations. It is also clear that the pre-assignment registration was a circumstance that was specifically considered in the due diligence reports conducted before the investment date. However, the Parties dispute the object of Steag's expectation.\n\nResolution of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines registering the ARENALES facility, owned by ARENALES SOLAR PS, S.L., in the Pre-Assignment Register, granting it the regulated economic regime under Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, 2007 [**C-0009**].\n\n535.\n\nThe Claimant explains that within the regulatory framework designed by Spain to attract investments, \"*[o]perators assumed that, once registered in the RAIPRE, projects would be promoted in accordance with the regulatory framework of RD 661/2007*.\"1119 Specifically, Steag argues that \"*Spain created in the Claimant the legitimate expectation that the regulation of thermosolar energy for facilities registered in the pre-assignment remuneration register would not undergo drastic changes*.\"1120 The Claimant asserts that, in its understanding, \"***tariffs applicable to thermosolar energy** would only be revised in the future and would not negatively affect existing plants*.\"1121 Spain, on the other hand, contends that this expectation lacks foundation because Spanish law only guaranteed a reasonable return, not the fossilization of the regulatory regime.1122\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 379.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 349, et seq.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 373 (emphasis added).\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 908, 910.\n\n536.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting that both Parties agree that Spanish law guarantees a reasonable return. By the time of investment, the concept of reasonable return had been a constant feature in the evolution of Spain's legal framework. The principle of reasonable return appears in the Electricity Sector Law (LSE) of 1997,1123 in RD 436/2004,1124 in RDL 7/2006,1125 RD 661/2007,1126 RD 1614/20101127 and RDL 1/2012.1128 In this regard, this Tribunal concurs with the conclusion of the award in *RREEF v. Spain*, where it was held that \"*A reasonable return or reasonable profit was undoubtedly part of the guarantees granted to the Claimants \u2014 and, more broadly, to all investors in the Spanish RE sector*.\"1129 The issue in this case is whether Steag had an expectation of additional stability, beyond the general concept of reasonable return referred to in the cited provisions or, in other words, whether Steag had a legitimate expectation that a certain level of profitability, previously established by Spain as reasonable return, would be maintained.\n\nArticle 30.4 of the 1997 LSE stipulated for special regime installations that \"*For the determination of premiums, consideration shall be given to the voltage level of energy delivery to the grid, the effective contribution to environmental improvement, primary energy savings, energy efficiency, and the investment costs incurred, **in order to achieve reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market***\" [**CL-0008**; **R-0003]** (emphasis added).\n\nThe First Additional Provision of Royal Decree 436/2004 stated: \"*The economic regime of these installations shall particularly consider their effective contribution to environmental improvement, primary energy savings, and energy efficiency. It shall also take into account the investment costs incurred to ensure **reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in capital markets.*****\" [CL-0015; R-0082**] (emphasis added)\n\nRDL 7/2006, Article 1.13, which amends Article 30 of Law 54/1997, refers to the goal of \"*achieving **reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market***\" [**R-0071**] (emphasis added).\n\nArticle 44(3) of RD 661/2007, which referred to the revision of tariffs, premiums, supplements, and upper and lower limits (discussed in section 1.3.1 above), stated that revisions would be made \"***always guaranteeing reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market***\" [**CL-0018; R-0084**] (emphasis added).\n\nThe Preamble of RD 1614/2010 indicated that \"*the support scheme, as formulated, must be adapted \u2014 **while safeguarding the legal certainty of investments and the principle of reasonable return** \u2014 to the evolving reality of the learning curves of the different technologies and to the technical constraints that emerge with their increased penetration in the generation mix*\" [**CL-0022; R-0088**] (emphasis added).\n\nArticle 3 of RDL 1/2012 reiterates the guarantee of \"*reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market*\", even for new installations [**R-0074**].\n\n*RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Ltd. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Decision on Liability and on Principles for Quantum Assessment, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30 (November 30, 2018), \u00b6 381 [**RL-0140**].\n\n537.\n\nAfter analyzing the Parties' arguments and the evidence on record, the Tribunal finds that Steag did have an expectation of stability regarding a specific level of return, which had been defined as reasonable and which went beyond the mere concept of reasonable return. This expectation, as will be further explained below, related exclusively to three elements of the economic regime under RD 661/2007, namely: ***(i)*** Tariffs; ***(ii)*** Premiums; and ***(iii)*** and Lower and upper limits This conclusion is derived not only from an analysis of the laws that, in their entirety and prior to the investment date, embodied the economic promise inherent to Arenales Solar's registration in the pre-assignment register, but also from the Claimant's own arguments and statements.\n\n(i) The significance of Arenales Solar's pre-assignment registration within the regulatory framework in force at the time of the registration resolution's issuance\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n538.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that the Resolution of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines, dated December 11, 2009, registers Arenales Solar in the pre-assignment remuneration register and \"*grants it the economic regime regulated under Royal Decree 661*.\"1130 The scope of this resolution can only be understood by analyzing it in conjunction with the other provisions of the regulatory regime that were in force at that time.\n\nResolution of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines registering the ARENALES facility, owned by ARENALES SOLAR PS, S.L., in the Pre-Assignment Register, granting it the regulated economic regime under Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, 2007 [**C-0009**].\n\n539.\n\nThe starting point must be,1131 which introduced a remuneration system for electricity production under the special regime. The system established by this decree provided, *inter alia*:\n\n(i) The option of remuneration through either the fixed tariff option or the regulated tariff option, as set out in Articles 17(c)1132 and 24(1).1133 Article 17(c) clarifies that \"*[t]he right to receive the regulated tariff, or, as the case may be, a premium, shall be subject to the definitive registration of the installation in the Special Regime Production Installations Register under the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines, prior to the deadline established in Article 22*.\"1134\n\n(iii) Article 2(1)(b)(1) of RD 661/2007 allowed certain installations to benefit from the special regime, including \"*facilities that use as their primary energy source non-consumable renewable energies, biomass, or any type of biofuel, as long as their owner does not engage in production activities under the ordinary regime*.\" The regulation established specific subcategories of installations. Subgroup b.1.2 covered \"*[i]nstallations that use only thermal processes to convert solar energy, as primary energy, into electricity*. *These installations may use equipment that utilizes a fuel to maintain the temperature of the heat transfer fluid to compensate for the lack of solar irradiation that could affect the expected energy output. The electricity generation from such fuel must be less than, on an annual basis, 12% of the total electricity production if the installation sells its energy under option (a) of Article 24.1 of this Royal Decree* [regulated tariff per kilowatt-hour]. *This percentage may reach up to 15% if the installation sells its energy under option (b) of the aforementioned Article 24.1* [market price plus premium].\"\n\n(iii) Based on Article 17(b), the right to \"*[t]ransfer to the system, through the distribution or transmission company, its net electricity production or sold energy, provided that its absorption by the grid is technically possible.\"*\n\n(iv) Article 17(e) granted special regime installations the right to \"*[p]riority access and connection to the electricity grid under the terms set out in Exhibit XI of this Royal Decree or in the regulations that replace it*.\"\n\n(v) The decree granted remuneration for the useful life of the plants, in accordance with Article 36, which differentiated between various categories. According to the Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Report,1135 Arenales Solar was classified under group b.1.2, entitling it to a regulated tariff of 26.9375 c\u20ac/kWh for the first 25 years, with a reference premium of 25.4000. After this 25-year period, the regulated tariff was set at 21.5498 c\u20ac/kWh, with a reference premium of 20.3200. For plants in this group, an upper limit of 34.3976 c\u20ac/kWh and a lower limit of 25.4038 c\u20ac/kWh were established.\n\n(vi) Article 44.1 provided a mechanism for the \"*updating and review of tariffs, premiums, and supplements.*\" Article 44.3 specifically foresaw \"*the review of the tariffs, premiums, supplements, and upper and lower limits defined in this Royal Decree, taking into account the costs associated with each of these technologies, the level of participation of the special regime in meeting demand, and its impact on the technical and economic management of the system, always guaranteeing reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of capital in financial markets. Every four years thereafter, a new review will be carried out, maintaining the previous criteria.\"* The second paragraph of this provision stated that *\"[t]he reviews referred to in this section of the regulated tariff and of the upper and lower limits **shall not affect installations whose commissioning certificate was issued before January 1 of the second year following the year in which the review was conducted**.\"*1136\n\nRD 661/2007 [**CL-0018**; **R-0084**].\n\nThus, Article 17(c) of RD 661/2007 provides that producers under the special regime have the right to: \"*c) Receive payment for the sale, in whole or in part, of their net generated electricity in any of the options set out in Article 24.1, as stipulated in the economic regime of this royal decree [\u2026]*\" [**CL-0018**; **R-0084**].\n\nArticle 24.1 of RD 661/2007 states that: *\"1. To sell, in whole or in part, their net electricity production, the owners of installations subject to this royal decree must choose one of the following options: a) Transfer the electricity to the system through the transmission or distribution network, receiving a regulated tariff, which is the same for all scheduling periods, expressed in euro cents per kilowatt-hour. b) Sell the electricity in the electricity production market. In this case, the sale price of electricity will be the price determined in the organized market or the freely negotiated price agreed upon by the owner or representative of the installation, supplemented, where applicable, by a premium in euro cents per kilowatt-hour*\" [**CL-0018**; **R-0084**].\n\nArticle 22.1 of RD 661/2007 refers to the \"*period for maintaining regulated tariffs and premiums*\" and provides that: *\"1. Once 85 percent of the capacity target for a group or sub-group, as established in Articles 35 to 42 of this royal decree, has been reached, a resolution by the Secretary General of Energy will determine the maximum period during which installations registered in the Administrative Register of Special Regime Production Installations before the deadline will be entitled to the premium or, where applicable, the regulated tariff set in this royal decree for that group or sub-group. This period shall not be less than twelve months.*\" [**CL-0018; R-0084**].\n\nArenales Solar PS, S.L. \u2013 Due Diligence \u2013 Executive Summary, Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Abogados, June 5, 2012 [**C-0031**].\n\nRD 661/2007, art. 44 [**CL-0018**; **R-0084**]. (emphasis added)\n\n540.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the second paragraph of Article 44(3) of Royal Decree 661/2007 refers to installations whose commissioning certificates predate a certain date. It is worth emphasizing that Royal Decree 661/2007 made no reference to the pre-assignment register, which would be created later under Royal Decree-Law 6/2009. In any case, it is evident that the stability promised in the second paragraph of Article 44(3) of Royal Decree 661/2007 was limited exclusively to reviews of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits.\n\n541.\n\nIn 2009, with the enactment of Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, the pre-assignment remuneration register was created. The rationale behind this mechanism is explained in the recitals of the Royal Decree-Law, which state:\n\n*\"The current regulation of the special regime does not establish adequate mechanisms to plan installations of this type of energy, nor to determine the amount and timing of remuneration premiums and, therefore, the impact on the costs allocated to the tariff system. **The measure provided in the Royal Decree-Law, by creating the Pre-Assignment Remuneration Register, allows for the correction of the situation described above from the very moment of its entry into force.** It will allow, **within the timeframes set by the Royal Decree-Law, to determine which installations are not only planned but also comply with the conditions to be executed and connected to the electricity system with all legal and regulatory requirements, the volume of power associated with them, and their impact on electricity tariff costs and schedule.** In any case, **the rights and expectations of the owners of the installations are respected**, with the necessary safeguards being established and a transitional regime being provided for adaptation*.\"1137\n\nRDL 6/2009, Preamble [**CL-0020**; **R-0072**] (emphasis added).\n\n542.\n\nThe text of the provision itself indicates that the pre-assignment register was intended to protect the rights and, specifically, the \"*expectations*\" of installation owners. This further confirms that pre-assignment registration was capable of generating expectations.\n\n543.\n\nNonetheless, registration in the pre-assignment register, under the terms of RDL 6/2009 of April 30, did not yet grant a definitive right to the economic regime of RD 661/2007. In accordance with Article 4(2) of RDL 6/2009: \"*Registration in the Pre-Assignment Register for remuneration shall be a necessary condition for the granting of the right to the economic regime established in Royal Decree 661/2007, of May 25, regulating the production of electricity under the special regime*.\"1138 Along the same lines, the Council of Ministers' Agreement of November 13, 2009 emphasized that Article 4 of Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 \"*creates an administrative Pre-Assignment Remuneration Register for electricity production installations and establishes that registration therein shall be a **necessary condition for receiving the economic regime associated with the special regime***.\"1139 The same Agreement underscored the importance of definitive registration (Section IV). Article 4(8) of Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 further clarified that: *\"[I]nstallations registered in the Pre-Assignment Remuneration Register shall have a maximum period of thirty-six months from the date of notification to be definitively registered in the Administrative Register of Electricity Production Installations under the competent authority and to commence energy sales. **Otherwise, they shall lose the economic right associated with inclusion in the Pre-Assignment Remuneration Register***.\"1140\n\nRDL 6/2009, art. 4(2) [**CL-0020**; **R-0072**].\n\nResolution of November 19, 2009, from the Secretary of State for Energy, publishing the Council of Ministers Agreement of November 13, 2009, which regulates the ordering of projects or installations submitted to the administrative register of pre-assignment of remuneration for electricity production facilities, as provided for in Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, of April 30, adopting certain measures in the energy sector and approving the social bonus, of November 24, 2009 [**R-0098**] (emphasis added).\n\nRDL 6/2009, art. 4(8) [**CL-0020**; **R-0072**]. (emphasis added).\n\n544.\n\nRoyal Decree-Law 6/2009 clarifies the scope of the Resolution of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines, which \"*grants the economic regime regulated under Royal Decree 661/2007*\" to Arenales Solar PS, S.L., on December 11, 2009.1141\n\nResolution of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines registering the ARENALES facility, owned by ARENALES SOLAR PS, S.L., in the Pre-Assignment Register, granting it the regulated economic regime under Royal Decree 661/200.7 of May 25, 2007 [**C-0009**].\n\n545.\n\nThe pre-assignment register created expectations of stability and granted the economic regime of Royal Decree 661/2007, but it did so under the conditions of Royal Decree-Law 6/2009. In the case of Arenales Solar, the Tribunal notes that the resolution of December 11, 2009, repeatedly references Royal Decree-Law 6/2009.1142 The registration is carried out in accordance with the Fourth Transitional Provision, which relates to the requirements for pre-registration,1143 and subject to the Fifth Transitional Provision, concerning the fulfillment of installed capacity targets.1144\n\nThe resolution states: *\"In accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of the fifth transitional provision of the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law [RDL 6/2009], the economic regime of installations registered in the Pre-Assignment Register for Remuneration pursuant to the provisions of the fourth transitional provision of the same, shall be as provided in Royal Decree 661/2007, dated September 26.\"* [**C-0009**].\n\nRDL 6/2009, Fourth Transitional Provision (\"*Special regime installations that, at the time of the entry into force of this royal decree-law, met the requirements of the pre-assignment remuneration register. Those installation projects, except for photovoltaic solar technology, that, at the time of the entry into force of this royal decree-law, met the requirements established in Article 4.3, except as provided in paragraph i), shall have a period of 30 calendar days from the date of entry into force of this royal decree-law to submit their application to the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines. Likewise, they shall have an additional 30 calendar days to deposit the guarantee referred to in Article 4(3)(i) of this royal decree-law and to submit the corresponding receipt to the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines. Once compliance with the prior requirements of the installation projects has been verified, they shall be registered in the pre-assignment remuneration register*\") [**CL-0020**; **R-0072**]*.*\n\nRDL 6/2009, Fifth Transitional Provision (\"*Fulfillment of the installed capacity targets for the special regime upon the entry into force of this royal decree-law. 1. When the power associated with the projects registered pursuant to the Fourth Transitional Provision of this royal decree-law, for a group and sub-group, is below the corresponding capacity target established in Royal Decree 661/2007, of May 25, the economic regime provided therein shall be extended until the target is met. If, on the contrary, the power associated with the registered projects exceeds the planned target, the economic regime established in RD 661/2007 shall apply and be exhausted with the registered installations. In this case, by agreement of the Council of Ministers, at the proposal of the Minister of Industry, Tourism, and Trade, annual restrictions may be established on the execution and entry into operation of registered installations and their prioritization, in order to avoid compromising the technical and economic sustainability of the system, appropriately extending, where applicable, the maximum period established in Article 4.8 of this royal decree-law.\")* [**CL-0020**; **R-0072**]*.*\n\n546.\n\nRDL 6/2009 stipulates that facilities had to be definitively registered in the RAIPRE within a specified period and establishes that failure to meet this requirement would result in the loss of the *\"economic right associated with inclusion in the pre-assignment remuneration register.\"* In other words, the registration resolution in the pre-assignment register did not create an acquired right, but rather established a legitimate and objective expectation that, if certain additional requirements were met, access to the economic regime of RD 661/2007 would be granted. As explicitly stated in RDL 6/2009 and reaffirmed by the Council of Ministers Agreement of November 24, 2009,1145 registration was a prerequisite for ultimately receiving the economic regime of RD 661/2007.\n\nResolution of November 19, 2009, from the Secretary of State for Energy, publishing the Council of Ministers Agreement of November 13, 2009, which regulates the ordering of projects or installations submitted to the administrative register of pre-assignment of remuneration for electricity production facilities, as provided for in Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, of April 30, adopting certain measures in the energy sector and approving the social bonus, of November 24, 2009 [**R-0098**].\n\n547.\n\nThe right acquired by Arenales Solar pursuant to the resolution of December 11, 2009, was therefore not definitive. The installation still had to comply with the necessary conditions for definitive registration.\n\n(ii) Royal Decree 1614/2010 and the Expectation of Stability in Tariffs, Premiums, and Upper and Lower Limits\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n548.\n\nAccording to Steag, in 2010, Spain granted installations registered in the Pre-Assignment Register the right to enhanced stability. The Claimant first invokes the 2010 ER Communiqu\u00e9,\n\n549.\n\nThe 2010 ER Communiqu\u00e9, in which, according to Steag, the State \"*emphasised the commitment acquired in RD661/2007*\", is actually a press release titled \"*Industry reaches agreement with the wind and solar thermal sectors to revise their remuneration frameworks*,\" issued by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and Trade on July 2, 2010. The specific message of this document states: \"*The Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and Trade has reached agreements with the wind and solar thermal industry associations, Asociaci\u00f3n Empresarial E\u00f3lica (AEE) and Protermosolar, respectively, to revise the regulatory frameworks for electricity production using these technologies*.\"1146\n\nPress release: \"Industry reaches agreement with the wind and solar thermal sectors to revise their remuneration frameworks,\" issued by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and Trade p. 1 [**CL-0021**].\n\n550.\n\nThe document explicitly mentions a \"*pact*\" or \"*agreement*\" between the Ministry and the solar thermal energy sector regarding some modifications to the regulatory regime. The press release expressly states: ***(i)*** That the premiums for wind technology provided for in Royal Decree 661/2007 would be reduced by 35% until January 1, 2013; ***(ii)*** That solar thermal plants would be prevented from accessing the market price plus premium option for one year of operation; ***(iii)*** That the commissioning of solar thermal plants would be delayed relative to the scheduled dates of the projects presented for pre-registration under Royal Decree-Law 6/2009; and ***(iv)*** That a cap would be imposed on the number of hours eligible for remuneration above market price for wind and solar thermal plants.1147\n\nPress release: \"Industry reaches agreement with the wind and solar thermal sectors to revise their remuneration frameworks,\" issued by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and Trade p. 2 [**CL-0021**].\n\n551.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal acknowledges that the press release announced that the State would reinforce \"*the visibility and stability of the regulation of these technologies going forward, guaranteeing the current premiums and tariffs under Royal Decree 661/2007 for operating installations (and for those included in the pre-register) from 2013 onwards*.\"1148\n\nPress release: \"Industry reaches agreement with the wind and solar thermal sectors to revise their remuneration frameworks,\" issued by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, and Trade p. 2 [**CL-0021**].\n\n552.\n\nHowever, the 2010 ER Communiqu\u00e9 does not have the scope that the Claimant ascribes to it in its submissions.1149 The Tribunal finds that this communiqu\u00e9 serves as contextual information and reveals that, by mid-2010, Spain was already planning to modify certain elements of the regulatory regime for renewable energy while also seeking to guarantee some stability for registered companies. However, the 2010 ER Communiqu\u00e9 did not grant specific economic rights.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 386.\n\n553.\n\nThe specific, clear, and objective stability commitment was materialized through RD 1614/2010 of December 7. The key regulatory milestone was RD 1614/2010, issued on December 7, 2010.\n\n554.\n\nThe recitals of RD 1614/2010 state:\n\n\"Therefore, this Royal Decree aims to resolve certain inefficiencies in the application of the aforementioned Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 of April 30, for wind and solar thermal technologies.

[\u2026] This agreement also reinforces the visibility and stability of the regulation of these technologies in the future, guaranteeing the current premiums and tariffs under Royal Decree 661/2007 for operating installations (and those included in the pre-register) from 2013 onwards*.\"1162 Steag highlights the use of the terms \"*agreement*\" and \"*pact*\" in the document.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 387.\n\nMemorial of Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 386, citing Evaluation of the Potential of Solar Thermal Energy, PER 2011-2020 Technical Study, IDAE, 2011, pp. 28, 29 [**CL-0116**].\n\n562.\n\nSteag asserts that from the regulatory texts, announcements, and reports in the record, it can be concluded that \"*Spain saw the Original Regulatory Regime, enshrined in Royal Decree 661/2007 and Royal Decree 1614/2010, as a commitment to solar thermal installation*s.\"1163 According to the Claimant, Spain's measures and statements over the years \"*generated legitimate expectations for investors like Steag*.\"1164 The Claimant emphasizes, in particular, that \"***RD 1614/2010 played a fundamental role*** in shaping Steag's legitimate expectations.\"1165\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 389.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 389.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 335 (emphasis added).\n\n563.\n\nAt the same time, Steag clarifies in its Memorial of Reply on the Merits that \"*[t]he Claimant's position is not that the Original Regulatory Regime was immutable, but rather that over an extended period, Spain repeatedly announced that the tariffs applicable to solar thermal energy would only be reviewed in the future and would not negatively affect Existing Plants.*\"1166\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 373.\n\n564.\n\nThe Respondent challenges Steag's interpretation of the provisions cited above. According to Spain, these regulations do not constitute a stabilization clause, nor do they establish an objective expectation that the remuneration regime would be frozen upon registration in the RAIPRE. Regarding Article 44(3) of Royal Decree 661/2007, the Respondent presents two arguments:\n\n565.\n\n***First***, it cannot be deduced from the literal wording of the article that there is a stabilization clause freezing the Spanish regulatory framework for an indefinite period of time.1167 The text limits its scope to the reviews provided for in that section of the regulation. It only refers to revisions of \"*the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits.*\"1168 The provision does not grant stability against \"any revision.\"1169 Thus, Spain argues that Article 44(3) does not prevent revisions aimed at avoiding overcompensation or ensuring the sustainability of the SEE and certainly does not freeze the choice between the tariff and premium regimes or the CPI-based updates.1170\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 448; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 650.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 453.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 449.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 451, 452.\n\n566.\n\nThe Respondent draws a comparison between Article 40(3) of Royal Decree 436/2004 and Article 44(3) of Royal Decree 661/2007. Article 40 of Royal Decree 436/2004 referred to \"*tariffs, premiums, incentives, and supplements*\" and used much more restrictive language, explicitly stating that revisions would apply to plants entering operation after the decree came into effect, \"*without retroactive impact on previous tariffs and premiums*.\"1171\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 459, 460.\n\n567.\n\nThis contrasts with Article 44 of Royal Decree 661/2007, which does not apply to premiums, incentives, or supplements, nor does it mention retroactivity.1172 The Respondent points out that the Spanish Supreme Court repeatedly held that Article did not prevent regulatory measures, provided they were consistent with the guarantee of reasonable return and aligned with Law 54/1997.1173\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 460.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 461.\n\n568.\n\n***Second*****,** Spain also argues that energy regulations were subordinate to Law 54/1997 and, consequently, to the fundamental principle of SEE sustainability.1174 In cases such as Charanne and Isolux, it was decided that the regulatory framework could not create the legitimate expectation that it would not be modified by laws like those adopted in 2010.1175\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 455.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 463-466.\n\n569.\n\nRegarding Article 4 of RD 1614/2010, the Respondent argues that it is merely a provision that, taking into account the entry into force of RDL 6/2009 and the Agreement of the Council of Ministers of 13 November 2009, extended Article 44(3) of Royal Decree 661/2007 to certain solar thermal installations.1176 Specifically, the purpose of the provision was to extend what was established in the second paragraph of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 to the premiums for pre-registered installations.1177\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1056.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 853. See also \u00b6\u00b6 859, 860.\n\n570.\n\nSpain reiterates its argument regarding the differences between Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 and RD 661/2007, noting that even though Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 was much more restrictive, it did not prevent the application of numerous regulatory revisions to existing installations. (e.g. The revisions introduced by RDL 7/2006, Royal Decree 661/2007, RDL 6/2009, The Council of Ministers Agreement of November 13, 2009, and Royal Decree 1565/2010).1178 For Spain, it follows that Articles 4 and 5(3) of RD 1614/2010 could not have the effect of preventing further revisions.1179 Thus, Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 does not constitute a stabilization clause, nor does it modify the scope of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007.1180\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 861.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 861.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 852.\n\n571.\n\nAccording to Spain, the effect of Articles 4 and 5(3) of RD 1614/2010 was merely to modify the wording of Article 40(3) of the repealed RD 436/2004, extend the provisions of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 to include premiums, and finally to ensure that these provisions applied to pre-registered installations.1181 In Spain's view, the Claimant's interpretation is incorrect, as the regulation does not prevent the regulator from \"*revising the existing economic regime when necessary to ensure the sustainability of the SEE and guarantee reasonable return*.\"1182 Spain insists that the core principle in energy remuneration regulations is the guarantee of reasonable return, not the freezing of the regulatory framework.1183\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 859, 860.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1056.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 908, 910.\n\n572.\n\nThe Parties also dispute the intended purpose of the regulations under review. Steag argues that Spanish law on this matter was not primarily aimed at adjusting SEE income and costs but rather had \"*the declared purpose of attracting new investors*.\"1184 Spain contends that RD 661/2007 was never part of a state-driven campaign to attract investors and insists that any diligent investor would have been aware that the regulatory framework could change.1185\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 316.\n\nMemorial of Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 1289, citing \u00b6 772 of *Isolux v. Spain* [**RL-0090**].\n\n573.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, over an extended period, Spain indeed sought to create a relatively stable framework for investors. Even before RD 661/2007, RD 436/2004 already sought to establish a regulatory framework for special tariffs that was \"*durable, objective, and transparent*.\"1186 Similarly, the preambles of RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010, concerning the renewable energy sector,1187 and other documents such as the 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan, acknowledged that Spain needed to provide incentives ensuring long-term stability to achieve its policy objectives for the CSP sector.1188\n\nRD 436/2004 [**CL-0015; R-0082**]; Economic Report on RD 436/2004, p. 2 [**R-0014**].\n\nRD 661/2007 [**CL-0018; R-0084**]; Project Report on RD 661/2007 [**R-0065**].\n\n2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan [**CL-0016; R-0101**].\n\n574.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the text of Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 and Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, both enacted prior to the Claimant's investment, must be interpreted within the legislative and regulatory context of the time in which they were issued. Before Steag's investments in 2012, regulatory changes occurred in the renewable energy sector that affected operational facilities. These changes were implemented through Royal Decree 1565/2010, Royal Decree 1614/2010, and RDL 14/2010.1189 These late 2010 regulatory changes should have obviously been taken into account by any investor intending to invest in the sector \u2014 as was the case for the Claimant.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 934. On November 19, 2010 the RD 1565/2010 was approved, regulating and amending certain aspects related to electricity production activity under the special regime. On December 7, 2010, RD 1614/2010 was approved, regulating and amending certain aspects related to electricity production activity using solar thermal and wind technologies. On December 23, 2010, Royal Decree-Law 14/2010 was approved, establishing urgent measures to correct the tariff deficit in the electricity sector.\n\n575.\n\nAt the same time, having considered the Parties' arguments regarding Articles 44(3) of RD 661/2007 and 4 of RD 1614/2010, the Tribunal finds merit in the view that the cited provisions reflect an intent to provide stability for certain elements to facilities registered in the pre-assignment register. At least from the enactment of RD 1614/2010, which applies to solar thermal energy, facilities registered in the pre-assignment register could legitimately expect that certain elements of the RRO would be maintained over time. Spain itself acknowledges that RD 1614/2010 extends Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 to certain solar thermal facilities, in light of the entry into force of RDL 6/2009 and the Council of Ministers Agreement of November 13, 2009.1190\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1056.\n\n576.\n\nArticle 4 of RD 1614/2010, which applies to Arenales Solar as a pre-registered facility under the fourth transitory provision of RDL 6/2009, protects that facility against specific revisions. However, the scope of this protection is not unlimited and does not apply to all economic elements of the special regime established by RD 661/2007. In the Tribunal's view, it is clear that, as the Claimant itself states in its arguments regarding its expectations, \"*RD 1614/2010 played a fundamental role in shaping the legitimate expectations.*\"1191 It is the Claimant itself that acknowledges that the expectations created by the registration resolution are those derived from RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010, interpreted together, and not RD 661/2007 in isolation. As of the investment date, there was no objective basis to extend the expectation of stability beyond the three elements listed in Article 4 of RD 1614/2010: ***(i)*** Tariffs; ***(ii)*** Premiums; and ***(iii)*** Lower and upper limits.\n\nReply Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 335.\n\n(iii) The 2011 Announcements and the Moratorium under RDL 1/2012\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n577.\n\nIn 2011, Spain made significant statements regarding the future of the Spanish Electricity System (SEE). In this regard, the Sustainable Economy Act of March 2011 stated:\n\n\"In accordance with this [energy] planning, legislation will regulate the necessary public incentives to meet the objectives set forth in the previous section, in accordance with the following principles: a) Guarantee of an adequate return on investments in special regime technologies, which encourages an installation volume compatible with the objectives established in energy plans. [\u2026] e) In all cases, it must be ensured that the objectives are met while considering the principles of economic efficiency among the various alternatives and the economic sustainability of the measures adopted.\"1192\n\nLaw 2/2011, of March 4, 2011, on Sustainable Economy (\"**Law 2/2011**\"), Art. 79.4, lit. a and d [**R-0062**].\n\n578.\n\nIn December 2011, during his investiture speech, the President of the Government, Mariano Rajoy Brey, explicitly referred to the need for structural reforms in the energy sector due to the tariff deficit crisis:\n\n\"We must be fully aware that Spain has a significant energy problem, especially in the electricity sector, with an annual deficit exceeding \u20ac3 billion and an accumulated tariff debt of more than \u20ac22 billion. Electricity tariffs for household consumers are the third highest in Europe, and the fifth highest for industrial consumers. [\u2026] If reforms are not undertaken, the imbalance will become unsustainable, and price and tariff increases would place Spain at the greatest competitive disadvantage in energy costs within the entire developed world. **We will therefore have to implement a policy focused on curbing and reducing the system's average costs**, making decisions without demagoguery, using all available technologies without exceptions, and regulating with the primary objective of ensuring the competitiveness of our economy.\"1193\n\nSpeech by Mariano Rajoy during the investiture session as President of the Government, Congress of Deputies, December 19, 2011, p. 11 [**R-0173**] (emphasis added).\n\n579.\n\nThese statements suggested that changes were forthcoming. However, they did not indicate that such changes would impact the economic benefits granted by Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 to facilities registered in the pre-assignment register.\n\n580.\n\nAfter the enactment of RD 1614/2010 and a few months before Steag's investment, Spain introduced a moratorium on the registration of new electricity generation facilities through RDL 1/2012, dated January 27.\n\n581.\n\nThe purpose of RDL 1/2012, as stated in Article 1, was: \"*a) The elimination of economic incentives for electricity production facilities under the special regime and for those under the ordinary regime using technologies comparable to those included in the special regime, as detailed in Article 2.1. b) The suspension of the pre-assignment remuneration procedure for granting the premium economic regime.*\"1194\n\nRoyal Decree-Law 1/2012, of January 27, 2012, suspending pre-assignment remuneration procedures and eliminating economic incentives for new electricity production installations from cogeneration, renewable energy sources, and waste (\"**RDL 1/2012**\") [**R-0074**].\n\n582.\n\nArticle 2 of RDL 1/2012, which defines its scope of application, provides a clear material scope for the pre-assignment register:\n\n\"1. This Royal Decree-Law shall apply to the following installations:\n\na) Those facilities under the special regime that, as of the date of entry into force of this royal decree-law, **had not been registered in the pre-assignment remuneration register**, as provided for in Article 4.1 of Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, of April 30, which adopted certain measures in the energy sector and approved the social tariff.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n2. This royal decree-law **shall not apply to special regime facilities that had submitted an application for registration in the pre-assignment remuneration register**, where the corresponding resolution deadline, pursuant to Articles 42(2) and 42(3) of Law 30/1992, of November 26, on the Legal Regime of Public Administrations and Common Administrative Procedure, had already expired as of its entry into force.\"1195\n\nRDL 1/2012, art. 2 [**R-0074**] (emphasis added).\n\n583.\n\nFurthermore, Article 4 of RDL 1/2012 suspended the registration of new facilities in the pre-assignment register.\n\n584.\n\nThe Claimant argues that \"*[t]his moratorium was also crucial for the Claimant's interest in Arenales Solar, as it understood that this measure marked the definitive end of the adjustments applicable to renewable energy sources (RES), and specifically to concentrated solar power (CSP)*.\"1196 Specifically, according to the Claimant, the moratorium and the regulations preceding it led Steag to believe that Arenales Solar would benefit from the RRO throughout its regulatory lifespan and that this remuneration would not be reduced.1197 As the Claimant puts it: \"*[t]he moratorium under RDL 1/2012, the presence of RD 1614/2010 in relation to RD 661/2007, and the registration in the pre-assignment remuneration register and in RAIPRE were the main sources of security for the Claimant regarding the remuneration Arenales Solar would receive for its electricity production.*\"1198\n\nReply Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 339. See also\u00b6 11.\n\nReply Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 353, 392, 393 y 395.\n\nReply Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 401-403.\n\n585.\n\nIn turn, the Respondent asserts that Steag misinterpreted the fact that these measures did not affect its investment as an indication that Spain would not modify the existing commitments formalized through its registration in RAIPRE.1199\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 476.\n\n586.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant in asserting that the moratorium introduced by RDL 1/2012 and the inclusion in the pre-assignment remuneration register under RDL 6/2009 created the expectation that this register protected the plant's remuneration mechanisms.1200\n\nReply Memorial on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 278.\n\n587.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that the stability being promised went beyond a generic concept of reasonable return. Reasonable return, in general, is a guarantee granted not only to facilities registered in the pre-assignment register but also to new installations. For example, the final clause of Article 3 of RDL 1/2012, which establishes the \"*[r]emoval of economic incentives for new installations,\"* states that the determination of specific economic regimes would be carried out \"*taking into account reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital markets.*\"1201 Thus, under this provision, a facility did not necessarily have to be in the pre-assignment register for Spanish law to ensure it a reasonable return.\n\nRDL 1/2012 [**R-0074**].\n\n588.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal finds that RDL 1/2012 did not alter the content of Article 4 of RD 1614/2010. Therefore, it did not change the scope of the expectation generated by the previous regulations. As noted above, the protection referred to very specific elements of the remuneration system, as outlined in the 2010 regulation: ***(i)*** tariffs; ***(ii)*** premiums; and ***(iii)*** upper and lower limits.\n\n589.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, as of June 8, 2012, the date of the investment, Arenales Solar had a legitimate expectation that the economic regime resulting from RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 would apply, provided certain conditions were met.\n\n590.\n\nThe Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Report1202 itself states that: (***i***) Arenales Solar was already recognized as a special regime producer, classified under Group b.1.2 of RD 661/2007; (***ii***) The facility or project was registered in the pre-assignment register, under phase 4, meaning that definitive registration had to take place before December 31, 2013, \"*to obtain the guaranteed feed-in tariffs under RD 661/2007*\"; and (***iii***) Arenales Solar had priority access, with a capacity of 50 MW at the SET Don Rodrigo station. The report concluded that \"*ARENALES has met the essential general conditions to apply the guaranteed tariff regime, but must ensure that the installation is completed on time*.\"1203\n\nArenales Solar PS, S.L. \u2013 Due Diligence \u2013 Executive Summary, Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Abogados, June 5, 2012 [**C-0031**].\n\nArenales Solar PS, S.L. \u2013 Due Diligence \u2013 Executive Summary, Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Abogados, June 5, 2012, \u00b6 4(a) [**C-0031**].\n\n591.\n\nThe investor engaged Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Abogados to prepare a report on the regulatory status of the Arenales Plant and the real estate permits required for its operation. The analysis report1204 dated January 7, 2012, explicitly stated that at the time of the investment, the Arenales Solar plant: \"*has been entered into the registry of pre-registrations (Registro de Preasignaci\u00f3n, Real Decreto-Ley 6/2009 dated 30/4 and Real Decreto 1/2012 dated January 27), initially in phase 3, but on application by ARENALES now in phase 4. As a result, the definitive registration in the Registro Auton\u00f3mico de Instalaciones de Producci\u00f3n en R\u00e9gimen Especial (RAIPRE) must be effected before January 1, **2014 in order to be able to obtain the promised feed-in tariffs according to RD 661/2007** dated May 25*.\"1205\n\nAnalysis of the Legal Report Regarding the Current Situation of Approvals and Real Estate Legal, Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Abogados, January 7, 2012 [**C-0032**].\n\nAnalysis of the Legal Report Regarding the Current Situation of Approvals and Real Estate Legal, Fr\u00f6hlingsdorf Abogados, de January 7, 2012, \u00b6 8 [**C-0032**] (emphasis added).\n\n592.\n\nSimilarly, the Cuatrecasas Report1206 stated that the Arenales project was pre-assigned and was at that time in phase 4, meaning that definitive registration had to be completed by January 1, 2014 and that: \"***If** the Project meets these deadlines, **it will be eligible for the remuneration regime established in Royal Decree 661/2007***.\"1207\n\nLegal Audit Report: Proyecto Termosolar Arenales Solar PS, S.L., Cuatrecasas, Gon\u00e7alves Pereira S.L.P., July 26, 2011 [**C-0017**].\n\nLegal Audit Report: Proyecto Termosolar Arenales Solar PS, S.L., Cuatrecasas, Gon\u00e7alves Pereira S.L.P., July 26, 2011 p.10 [**C-0017**] (emphasis added).\n\n(iv) Conclusion on the scope of Steag's legitimate expectation\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n593.\n\nAfter analyzing RD 661/2007, RDL 6/2009, RD 1614/2010, and RDL 1/2012 together, the Tribunal has found that the registration resolution of December 2009, interpreted in light of RDL 6/2009 and considering the stability commitment established in Article 4 of RD 1614/2010, which was also linked to that resolution, was capable of generating a legitimate expectation of stability concerning certain elements of the economic regime applicable to Arenales Solar.\n\n594.\n\nThis expectation of stability does not translate into a \"*freeze*\" of the entirety of RD 661/2007 with respect to Arenales Solar. Spain defined, within the cited regulations, the elements that constituted a reasonable return, and Steag obtained from Spain an administrative act of a specific and concrete nature that established the components of reasonable return, provided that certain conditions were met. The expectation that Steag could objectively have and did have as of June 8, 2012, was that: The reasonable return determined by Spain at that time would be upheld; The tariffs, premiums, and upper and lower limits referenced in RD 1614/2010\u2014a regulation that the Claimant itself considers fundamental to its expectations \u2014 would remain unchanged. This stability would extend for the plant's useful life, provided that the requirement of definitive registration before January 1, 2014, was met \u2014 which it was.\n\n*d) Frustration of Steag's Legitimate Expectations*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n595.\n\nThe Claimant has successfully demonstrated that it had an expectation of stability regarding the elements of premium, tariff, and upper and lower limits under the economic regime applicable to the Arenales Solar plant throughout the installation's useful life. Steag alleges that this expectation was frustrated by the gradual adoption of the NRR. Specifically, the Claimant argues that, after making the investment, \"*the Spanish Government, under the presidency of Mr. Rajoy Brey, introduced, retroactively, a series of changes to the regime applicable to solar thermal power plants (which, of course, includes Arenales Solar) on the grounds that this would eliminate the Spanish tariff deficit.\"*1208\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 88. See also Spain's description of the purpose of RDL 2/2013 in Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 676; Table with the Separate Economic Impact of Each of the Challenged Measures under the DCF Model, submitted by the Claimant's Experts on March 15, 2019, \u00b6 3(b).\n\n596.\n\nAccording to Steag, the NRR was structured through six legislative milestones:1209 ***(i)*** Law 15/2012; ***(ii)*** RDL 2/2013; ***(iii)*** RDL 9/2013; ***(iv)*** Law 24/2013, or the 2013 LSE; ***(v)*** RD 413/2014; and, finally, ***(vi)*** Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 89.\n\n597.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the NRR's provisions represented a \"*drastic change*\" whose severity progressively increased as the aforementioned legislative instruments were enacted.1210 Steag describes how Spain gradually dismantled the economic regime under RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010.1211 The Tribunal will now examine each of these legislative milestones to determine the extent to which the measures adopted through them disrupted Steag's legitimate expectation of stability in tariffs, premiums, and upper and lower limits, as previously described.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 91 et seq.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 91 et seq.\n\n598.\n\n**Law 15/2012**,1212 enacted on December 27, introduced fiscal measures for energy sustainability with the stated objective of harmonizing the tax system with more efficient and environmentally friendly energy use. Steag's claim refers to two measures introduced by this law.\n\nLaw 15/2012 [**CL-0024**].\n\n599.\n\nThe first was the creation of a 7% tax on the total value of all electricity fed into the National Power Grid by energy producers (TVPEE). The Tribunal preliminarily notes that the substantive analysis of the alleged violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT excludes the allegations related to the introduction of the 7% TVPEE under Law 15/2012. The Tribunal has ruled that it lacks jurisdiction over this issue, as the TVPEE qualifies as a \"*tax measure*\" under Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT.\n\n600.\n\nThe second measure was the elimination of the possibility of selling electricity generated using natural gas under the regulated tariff.1213 The Tribunal notes that Final Provision One, Section 2, of Law 15/2012 added a seventh paragraph to Article 30 of Law 54/1997, which reads as follows:\n\n\"7: Electricity attributable to the use of a fuel in a generation facility that uses a non-consumable renewable energy source as its primary energy source shall not be subject to a premium economic regime, except in the case of hybrid facilities combining non-consumable and consumable renewable energy sources. In such cases, electricity attributable to the use of the consumable renewable energy source may be subject to a premium economic regime.\n\nFor this purpose, the Minister of Industry, Energy, and Tourism shall publish the methodology for calculating the electricity attributable to fuels used.\"1214\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 91. See also Spain's description of this aspect of Law 15/2012: Table Showing the Separate Economic Impact of Each of the Challenged Measures Under the DCF Model Presented by the Claimant's Experts, March 3, 2019, \u00b6 3(a).\n\nLaw 15/2012, Final Provision One [**CL-0024**].\n\n601.\n\nThis measure simply excludes electricity generated using fuels such as gas from the special regime. Ultimately, it affects the provision originally established under Article 2(1)(b)(1) of RD 661/2007, which allowed facilities in subgroup b.1.2 to sell electricity generated using a fuel under the special regime (up to 15% of annual production when choosing the market price plus premium option, or up to 12% under the regulated tariff per kilowatt-hour option).\n\n602.\n\nRegarding this measure, the Tribunal must determine whether the ability to sell electricity generated using a fuel under the special regime falls within the tariffs, premiums, and upper and lower limits referenced in RD 1614/2010 and, consequently, whether it constitutes an element of the RRO covered by Steag's legitimate expectations. The Tribunal finds that the answer to this question is not self-evident. Steag's submissions assert that RD 661/2007 \"*permitted the use of gas for up to 15% of total generation*\",1215 and that Law 15/2012 \"*eliminated the premiums for gas-generated electricity*\".1216 Even according to the Claimant, the possibility of including electricity produced with natural gas is distinct and separable from the measures related to the regulated tariff. Indeed, in its damage analyses, Steag treats this measure as a separate challenge from those concerning adjustments to the regulated tariff (i.e., the shift to adjustment based on the underlying Consumer Price Index), the reduction of the market price plus premium option to zero, and the modification of the remuneration regime (i.e., the determination of profitability based on the assumption of a standard facility).1217\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 42.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 91. See also Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 438 *(\"[Law 15/2012] eliminated any option to receive a Premium for gas-generated electricity\").*\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), Exhibit I: Separate Economic Impact of the Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 6, et seq.\n\n603.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the elimination of the ability to sell electricity generated from gas under the special regime, as per Law 15/2012, pertains to tariffs, premiums, and upper and lower limits referenced in Article 4 of RD 1614/2010, which does not explicitly guarantee stability for electricity generated using a fuel. When RD 1614/2010 refers to the ability to sell electricity produced by solar thermal technology installations using fuels, it does so in a different context, in Article 3(3), which does not suggest a stability guarantee based on pre-assignment registration.\n\n604.\n\nThe burden of proving that this specific measure violated a legitimate expectation lies with Steag. Apart from the damage calculations, this measure is only briefly mentioned in certain parts of Steag's Memorials.1218 These brief references are insufficient to establish that Spain violated the FET standard through this measure. Furthermore, the Claimant failed to demonstrate that this measure undermined the stability promise inherent in the pre-assignment registration and related regulations Steag's submissions focused exclusively on its legitimate expectation regarding tariffs, premiums, and upper and lower limits. The Tribunal finds that the Claimant did not present a convincing argument regarding this aspect of Law 15/2012. Steag failed to prove that it had a legitimate expectation concerning the ability to sell electricity produced using fuels such as gas under the special regime.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 91, 278; Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 438.\n\n605.\n\nWith **RDL 2/2013**,1219 two measures relevant to this case were introduced. First, the regulated tariff stopped being adjusted based on the CPI and instead began adjusting based on the Underlying CPI (which excludes the prices of energy products and unprocessed food).1220 According to Article 1 of RDL 2/2013:\n\n\"Effective as of January 1, 2013, in all methodologies linked to the Consumer Price Index that govern the adjustment of remuneration, tariffs, and premiums received by electricity system participants under the sectoral regulations, said index shall be replaced by the Consumer Price Index at constant taxes, excluding unprocessed food and energy products.\"1221\n\nRDL 2/2013 [**CL-0025**; **R-0077**].\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 92. See also Spain's description of the purpose of RDL 2/2013 in Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 676; Table with the Separate Economic Impact of Each of the Challenged Measures under the DCF Model, submitted by the Claimant's Experts on March 15, 2019, \u00b6 3(b).\n\nRDL 2/2013, art. 1 [**CL-0025**; **R-0077**].\n\n606.\n\nThe preamble of RDL 2/2013 explains the rationale behind this measure: *\"In the regulation of this sector, certain remuneration adjustment methodologies are linked to the evolution of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which could be influenced by tax variations, particularly relevant in the past year. It is not appropriate for an increase in a tax to trigger increases in the regulated remuneration of the electricity sector, whose costs are not directly related to direct consumption taxation. Therefore, in order to use a more stable index that is not affected by the volatility of unprocessed food and household fuel prices, all remuneration adjustment methodologies linked to the CPI shall replace it with the Consumer Price Index at constant taxes, excluding unprocessed food and energy products*.\"1222 The Tribunal finds it clear that this measure impacted Steag's expectations regarding tariffs, premiums, and upper and lower limits.\n\nRDL 2/2013, Preamble **[CL-0025; R-0077].**\n\n607.\n\n*Second*, according to Steag, RDL 2/2013 \"*completely eliminated the option to receive the premium, leaving CSP producers with the choice between the market price tariff or the fixed tariff*.\"1223 Article 2 of RDL 2/2013 modified certain provisions of RD 661/2007. Among these changes, it altered the tariffs and premiums applicable to category b) installations, listed in Table 3 of Article 36 of RD 661/2007. It is important to recall that Arenales Solar belongs to group b.1.2. That table previously established the regulated tariff, the reference premium, the upper limit, and the lower limit. Article 2 of RDL 2/2013 provided:\n\n\"Article 2. Amendment of Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, regulating the production of electricity under the special regime. Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, regulating the production of electricity under the special regime, is hereby amended as follows [\u2026]: Two. **In Table 3 of Article 36, the value of the reference premium for all subgroups is modified, reducing it to 0 c\u20ac/kWh, and the upper and lower limit values are removed**.\"1224\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 92.\n\nRDL 2/2013, art. 1 [**CL-0025**; **R-0077**]. (emphasis added)\n\n608.\n\nArticle 2 of RDL 2/2013 provided:\n\n\"The values of the premium and the applicable upper and lower limits shall be calculated based on the values for 50 MW solar thermal installations published in Ministerial Order IET/3586/2011 of December 30, which establishes the access tolls as of January 1, 2012, and the tariffs and premiums for installations under the special regime. These values shall be reduced by the percentage indicated in the cited resolution and shall be updated pursuant to Article 44 of Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, regulating the production of electricity under the special regime.\"1225\n\nRDL 2/2013, art. 4, sec. 2 **[CL-0025; R-0077]**.\n\n609.\n\n**RDL 2/2013** eliminated the market option, which had allowed solar thermal power installations to receive the premium, leaving them with only the market price tariff or the fixed tariff. Article 3 provided: Article 3 states:\n\n\"[Facilities] under the special regime that, from the entry into force of this royal decree-law, opt to sell their electricity under option b) of Article 24.1 of Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, regulating the production of electricity under the special regime, **may not subsequently switch to the option change provided for in Article 24(4) of said royal decree**.\"1226\n\nRDL 2/2013, art. 3 [**CL-0025**; **R-0077**]. (emphasis added)\n\n610.\n\nThe preamble of RDL 2/2013 states:\n\n\"[G]iven the volatility of market prices, the option of remuneration for electricity generated under the special regime through a premium supplementing that price makes it difficult to achieve the dual objective of guaranteeing a reasonable return for these installations while simultaneously preventing overcompensation, which would be borne by other electricity system participants. Therefore, **it is necessary for the premium economic regime to be based solely on the regulated tariff, without prejudice to the facility owners' ability to freely sell their electricity in the production market without receiving a premium**.\"1227\n\nRDL 2/2013, Preamble [**CL-0025**; **R-0077**] (emphasis added).\n\n611.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no doubt that these measures affected Steag's expectations regarding tariffs, premiums, and upper and lower limits, as described above.\n\n612.\n\n**RDL 9/2013** was, according to the Claimant's narrative, the breaking point.1228 The Complainant notes that RD 9/2013 \"*[...] amended Article 34* [sic] *of the 1997 Electricity Sector Law and repealed RD 661/2007, eliminating the entire fixed tariff and premium regime. In short, it abolished the Original Regulatory Regime and replaced it with a system that provides 'specific remuneration' based on 'standard' (but not actual) costs per unit of installed capacity, plus standard amounts for operating costs*.*\"*1229\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 93.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 93.\n\n613.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms that RDL 9/2013 introduced a profound modification of Article 30(4) of the 1997 LSE. According to Article 1 of RDL 9/2013:\n\n\"[\u2026] Article 30(4) is hereby amended as follows:\n\n\"4. Additionally, and under the terms to be determined by regulation through a royal decree issued by the Council of Ministers, in addition to the remuneration for the sale of the generated electricity at market price, installations may receive a specific remuneration consisting of a per-unit-of-installed-capacity component that covers, where applicable, **the investment costs of a standard facility that cannot be recovered through electricity sales**, and an operational component that covers, if applicable, the difference between operating costs and revenues from market participation of such standard facility.\n\nFor the calculation of this specific remuneration, the following will be considered **for a standard facility throughout its regulatory useful life and in reference to the activity performed by an efficient and well-managed company:**\n\na) **Standard revenues** from the sale of generated electricity valued at the market price.\n\nb) **Standard operating costs.**\n\nc) The **standard value** of the initial investment.\n\nFor this purpose, under no circumstances shall costs or investments determined by regulations or administrative acts that are not applicable throughout Spanish territory be considered. Likewise, only those costs and investments that exclusively pertain to electricity production activities shall be taken into account.\n\nDue to the unique characteristics of the insular and extra-peninsular electricity systems, specific standard installations may be exceptionally defined for each of them.\n\nThis remuneration regime shall not exceed the minimum level necessary to cover costs that allow installations to compete on equal terms with other technologies in the market and to enable them to obtain a reasonable return based on the standard facility applicable in each case. Nevertheless, this remuneration regime may exceptionally include an investment and timely execution incentive if the installation results in a significant reduction in costs in insular and extra-peninsular systems.\n\n**This reasonable return shall be, before taxes, based on the average return in the secondary market of ten-year Spanish government bonds, applying the appropriate differential.**\n\nThe parameters of the remuneration regime may be reviewed every six years.\"1230\n\nRDL 9/2013, Art. 1 [**CL-0026**] (emphasis added).\n\n614.\n\nThe Tribunal also confirms that RDL 9/2013 repealed both RD 661/2007 and Article 4 of RDL 6/2009, which had established the pre-assignment remuneration register.1231 The Sole Repeal Provision of RDL 9/2013 states:\n\n\"1: All rules of equal or lower rank that contradict or are inconsistent with this royal decree-law are hereby repealed.\n\n2. **The following provisions are expressly repealed:**\n\na) **Royal Decree 661/2007** of May 25, regulating the production of electricity under the special regime.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nc) **Article 4, the first additional provision and paragraph 2 of the fifth transitory provision of Royal Decree-Law 6/2009**, of April 30, adopting certain measures in the energy sector and approving the social bonus.\"1232\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 176.\n\nRDL 9/2013, Single Repealing Provision [**CL-0026**] (emphasis added).\n\n615.\n\nIn the preamble to RD 9/2013, Spain acknowledged that since 2012, \"*public intervention in the sector, aimed at correcting the imbalances resulting from the expansive evolution of the system's cost items, has led to the adoption of a series of urgent measures affecting both cost and revenue components over the past few years*.\"1233 Among the measures cited were RDL 1/2012, which suspended the Pre-Assignment Remuneration procedures, and Law 15/2012, which introduced exceptional measures to ensure that system costs would be financed through access toll revenues.1234 In its recitals, RD 9/2013 states that its purpose was to create a new regulatory framework to provide a comprehensive response to significant changes in circumstances over recent years, which were deemed \"*more than justified*.\" Additionally, \"*to implement this new regime repealed Article 4 of RDL 6/2009.*\"1235 The Tribunal finds that RD 9/2013 was intrinsically linked to Steag's legitimate expectations, as it eliminated the fixed-tariff and premium regime that formed part of the RRO.\n\nRDL 9/2013, Preamble [**CL-0026**].\n\nRDL 9/2013, Preamble **[CL-0026**].\n\nRDL 9/2013, Preamble **[CL-0026**].\n\n616.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, **Law 24/2013** \"*completely eliminated the distinction between the Ordinary and Special Regimes.*\"1236 The Tribunal has verified these claims. Indeed, the recitals of 2013 LSE (Law 24/2013) confirm this, stating: *\"Title IV regulates electricity production. **The differentiated concepts of Ordinary and Special Regimes are eliminated**, without prejudice to any specific considerations that may be necessary.*\"1237 Article 14 of 2013 LSE (Law 24/2013) sets out the framework for remunerating electricity production activities. Paragraph 7 states: \"*Exceptionally, the Government may establish a specific remuneration regime to promote electricity production from renewable energy sources* [...].\"1238\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 95 (emphasis added).\n\nLaw 24/2013, Preamble [**CL-0009**] (emphasis added).\n\nLaw 24/2013, Article 14 [**CL-0009**].\n\n617.\n\nThe law establishes the key features of this new remuneration regime: Subparagraph a) states:\n\n\"This remuneration regime, in addition to remuneration for the sale of electricity at market prices, shall consist of a term per unit of installed capacity to cover, where applicable, **investment costs for each standard facility** that cannot be recovered through energy sales in the market, and an operational term to cover, if applicable, the difference between operating costs and revenues from the market participation of the relevant **standard facility**.\"1239\n\nLaw 24/2013, Article 14, para. 7(a) [**CL-0009**] (emphasis added).\n\n618.\n\nThe parameters for remuneration are defined in subparagraph b), which states:\n\n\"b) For the calculation of this specific remuneration, the following will be considered, **for a standard facility throughout its regulatory useful life** and in reference to the activity performed by an **efficient and well-managed company**, the resulting values to be considered:\n\ni. **Standard revenues** from the sale of generated electricity valued at the market price.\n\nii. **Standard operating costs.**\n\niii. The **standard value** of the initial investment.\n\nFor this purpose, under no circumstances shall costs or investments determined by regulations or administrative acts that are not applicable throughout Spanish territory be considered. Likewise, only those costs and investments that exclusively pertain to electricity production activities shall be taken into account.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThis remuneration regime shall not exceed the minimum level necessary to cover costs that allow production facilities from renewable energy sources, high efficiency cogeneration and waste to compete on equal terms with other technologies in the market and to enable them to obtain a reasonable return based on the standard facility applicable in each case. **This reasonable return shall be, before taxes, based on the average return in the secondary market of ten-year Spanish government bonds, applying the appropriate differential**.\"1240\n\nLaw 24/2013, Article 14, para. 7(b) [**CL-0009**] (emphasis added).\n\n619.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the aforementioned provisions directly affect the core structure of the remuneration system and, therefore, impact Steag's expectation of stability regarding tariffs, premiums, and upper/lower limits, as described in paragraph 594 above.\n\n620.\n\nFinally, subparagraph (d) of 2013 LSE (Law 24/2013) provides: \"*d) **Electricity attributable to the use of a fuel in a generation facility that primarily relies on non-consumable renewable energy sources shall not be eligible for a specific remuneration regime,** except in the case of hybrid installations combining non-consumable and consumable renewable energy sources, in which case the electricity attributable to the consumable renewable energy source may be eligible for a specific remuneration regime* [...].\"1241 Regarding this point, the Tribunal refers to its earlier conclusion on the Final Provision One, paragraph 2, of Law 15/2012, which had already eliminated the possibility of applying the Special Regime to electricity produced with fuels such as natural gas.1242\n\nLaw 24/2013, Article 14, para. 7(d) [**CL-0009**] (emphasis added).\n\nLaw 15/2012, Preamble [**CL-0024**].\n\n621.\n\nThe next regulatory milestone is **RD 413/2014**.1243 The Claimant asserts that RD 413/2014 introduced a new remuneration model, based on the hypothetical performance of an efficient power plant.1244 Specifically, the Claimant argues: *\"The source of this instability lies in Articles 19 and 20 of RD 413/2014, which respectively define how the reasonable return and remuneration parameters will be reviewed.*\"1245\n\nRD 413/2014 [**CL-0027**].\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 96.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 466.\n\n622.\n\nArticle 19 of RD 413/2014 governs the *\"[r]eview of the value on which the reasonable return is based*\" as follows:\n\n\"1: The value on which the **reasonable return of standard facilities shall be based will be calculated as the average yield of ten-year government bonds in the secondary market over the 24 months prior to May of the year preceding the start of the regulatory period, increased by a spread.**\n\nThe revisions to the value on which the reasonable return is based shall apply to the remaining regulatory useful life of **standard facilities.**\n\n2. Before January 1 of the last year of the corresponding regulatory period, the Minister of Industry, Energy, and Tourism shall submit a draft law to the Council of Ministers, which will include a proposal for the spread value applicable to the following regulatory period, in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 14.4 of Law 24/2013, of December 26.\n\nTo determine this value, the Ministry of Industry, Energy, and Tourism may request a report from the National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC), which must be issued before July 1 of the penultimate year of the relevant regulatory period. Additionally, the Ministry may contract an independent specialized entity to conduct an assessment.\"1246\n\nRD 413/2014, Art. 19 [**R-0027**] (emphasis added).\n\n623.\n\nIn turn, Article 20 of RD 413/2014 governs the \"*[r]eview and update of the remuneration parameters*\". These provisions are consistent with the preamble of RD 413/2014, which states:\n\n\"For the calculation of investment remuneration and operating remuneration, **the standard revenues from energy sales at market prices, the standard operating costs required to carry out the activity, and the standard initial investment value will be considered for a standard facility, all based on an efficiently and well-managed company, will be considered for a standard facility.**\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe investment remuneration and, where applicable, the operating remuneration will cover the higher costs of production facilities using renewable energy sources, high-efficiency cogeneration, and waste, enabling them to compete on equal terms with other technologies and achieve **a reasonable return based on the relevant standard facility.**\n\nAdditionally, **the concept of a reasonable project return is normatively defined,** aligning with judicial doctrine on the subject established in recent years, **setting a pre-tax return approximately equal to the average yield of ten-year government bonds in the secondary market over the 24 months preceding May of the year before the start of the regulatory period, plus an appropriate spread**.\"1247\n\nRD 413/2014, Preamble [**CL-0027**] (emphasis added).\n\n624.\n\nFor the Tribunal, these measures affected the very essence of the expectation of stability concerning tariffs, premiums, and upper/lower limits, which RD 1614/2010 had established for facilities registered in the Pre-Assignment Remuneration Register,\n\n625.\n\nFinally, Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014,1248 issued on June 16, 2014, approved the \"*remuneration parameters for standard facilities applicable to certain electricity production facilities using renewable energy sources, cogeneration, and waste.*\" The preamble of the Ministerial Order states: \"*For the calculation of investment remuneration and operating remuneration, the following will be considered for a **standard facility**: **standard revenues** from energy sales at market prices, **standard operating costs** required to carry out the activity, and the **standard initial investment value**, all based on an **efficiently and well-managed company**, over its regulatory useful life*.\"1249 According to the Tribunal, this measure formalized the elements of a new remuneration regime and, as such, affected the expectation of stability regarding tariffs, premiums, and upper/lower limits.\n\nOrder IET/1045/2014 [**CL-0028**].\n\nOrder IET/1045/2014, Preamble [**CL-0028**] (emphasis added).\n\n626.\n\nThe Tribunal has thoroughly considered the legal framework that, according to the Claimant, frustrated its legitimate expectations. It is undeniable that Spain altered the tariffs, premiums, and upper/lower limits established under RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010. The NRR did not merely introduce modifications to the economic framework for facilities registered in the Pre-Assignment Register and RAIPRE. Instead, it fundamentally transformed the remuneration system, determining returns based on entirely new parameters, such as the \"*efficient installation*\" concept and a return model based on a \"*standard facility*\", whose characteristics were solely determined by the Spanish State at its discretion.\n\n627.\n\nAs previously stated, on June 8, 2012, Steag had a legitimate expectation that, provided it completed definitive registration before January 1, 2014, it would be entitled to benefit from the tariffs, premiums, and upper/lower limits for the entire useful life of the Arenales Solar installation. Spain radically altered the fundamental elements of the remuneration framework it had committed to maintaining for installations registered under the Pre-Assignment Register. Spain thus undermined the very expectation it had created regarding the applicable remuneration regime if the investor complied with the pre-assignment registration requirement, which in Steag's case was formalized through an individual and specific administrative act.\n\n628.\n\nSpain's defense has focused on the rationale behind the reforms. According to Spain, the NRR was a response to the tariff deficit and aimed to ensure the balance and sustainability of the SEE.1250 The Respondent also highlights the situation faced by the country as a result of the \"*international economic crisis*\", which generated a risk of unsustainability of the system, leading to an increase in the tariffs paid by the consumer and a reduction in demand.1251 Additionally, Spain argued that its measures implemented a rational public policy response to the tariff deficit.1252 According to the Respondent, the NRR measures were non-discriminatory, applied universally, and were transparent, all serving the objective of ensuring the sustainability of the SEE.1253\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 952-956.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 999.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1014-1031.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1009-1012.\n\n629.\n\nSpain further argues that, under the new regime, a diligent and well-managed producer could still achieve a reasonable return and cover both investment and operating cost.1254 The Respondent also pointed out that the Claimant's return exceeded that of other segments of the electricity sector. (e.g. such as transmission and distribution).1255 According to the Respondent, Steag's argument focuses on the stability allegedly provided by registration in the RAIPRE, which would supposedly prevent Spain from exercising its *ius variandi* in relation to Arenales Solar.1256 Spain disputes whether Steag could reasonably expect its interests to be protected at the expense of consumers and market distortions.1257 Spain further asserts that the NRR measures were never retroactive, arguing that they did not affect the Claimant's acquired rights, as Steag never had a vested right to a fixed and immutable FIT-based remuneration.1258 Finally, the Respondent contends that the NRR measures were proportionate and reasonable.1259\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 954-956 and 965.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 1353, citing the Tenth Additional Provision of Law 24/2013, submitted as Exhibit **R-0048**.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1242, 1243. The Respondent also provides a detailed summary of Steag's argument concerning its alleged legitimate expectations in \u00b6\u00b6 1242-1251 of the Rejoinder.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1251.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 961 and 966-968.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 988 et seq.\n\n630.\n\nThis Tribunal does not question the legitimacy of Spain's objectives in adjusting the economic regime for electricity production facilities as part of its energy policy. The Tribunal also does not need to assess whether the NRR was the best regulatory option available to Spain or whether it was successful in resolving the tariff deficit.1260 However, the Tribunal emphasizes that justifying a radical change in the remuneration framework for a protected investment cannot rely solely on invoking public policy objectives, no matter how laudable or important they may be to the economy. This is especially true when the State has made a specific commitment to a foreign investor, creating legitimate expectations that directly motivated a particular investment.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 435, 447 et seq.\n\n631.\n\nThis arbitration does not concern an abstract question of whether the SEE's regulatory framework could be modified. The Claimant has explained that its expectation was not that the regulatory framework would remain entirely immutable.1261 For the Tribunal, the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT does not prevent Spain from exercising its regulatory authority over the electricity sector. This case does not challenge Spain's *ius variandi* (right to modify regulations). States may modify their legislation, and regulatory changes may naturally have a negative impact on protected investments.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 349, et seq. and 373.\n\n632.\n\nNonetheless, the ECT requires the State to provide a stable and transparent legal framework for covered investments. Article 10(1) of the ECT explicitly refers to the objective of creating \"*stable, equitable, favorable, and transparent conditions for investors of other Contracting Parties to make investments in its territory.*\" This objective aligns with the European Energy Charter, which is explicitly referenced in Article 2 of the ECT. Legitimate Expectations and the State's Obligations Likewise, among the \"*objectives*\" listed in Title I of the ECT, reference is made to \"*the development of stable and transparent legal frameworks that create conditions for the development of energy resources.*\"\n\n633.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT does not eliminate the State's regulatory power but rather establishes certain limits on its exercise, protecting investors from changes to essential elements of the regulatory framework that motivated their investment.1262\n\nSee *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31 (June 15, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 530-532 [**CL-0130**]; *OperaFund Eco-Invest SICAV PLC y Schwab Holding AG v. Kingdom of Spain*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/36 (September 6, 2019), \u00b6 508, 509 [**CL-0162**].\n\n634.\n\nIn particular, when the State has created a legitimate expectation, and even more so when it has done so through a specific and concrete act, it cannot frustrate that expectation without offering reasonable compensation to the affected party. As the tribunal stated in *Cube Infrastructure v. Spain*, \"*A State cannot induce an investor to make an investment by generating legitimate expectations, only to later disregard the commitments that created those expectations*.\"1263 The State must respect specific commitments it has made, and in any case, it must exercise its *ius variandi* in a proportionate manner, taking into account the interests of affected parties.1264 In this case, Spain was entitled to exercise its regulatory power, but it was also obliged to respect the expectation it had created for Steag at the time of investment, which specifically protected tariffs, premiums, and upper/lower limits as established under Article 4 of RD 1614/2010.\n\n*Charanne BV et al. v. Kingdom of Spain*, Final Award, SCC Case No. V 062/2012 (January 21, 2016), \u00b6 486 [**RL-0049**].\n\nSee *Blusun S.A. et al. v. Republic of Italy,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/3 (December 27, 2016), \u00b6 319, No. 4 and 5 [**RL-0068**].\n\n635.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered Spain's argument regarding the supposed foreseeability of the NRR for a diligent investor, as well as the alleged lack of diligence on Steag's part in assessing the political and legal risks associated with an investment in Spain in 2012.1265 The Respondent argues that Steag failed to consider regulatory risks, macroeconomic risks, and the imminent reform of the RRO.1266 According to Spain, it is undisputed that Steag had sufficient information about the economic crisis affecting the renewable energy sector.1267 The regulatory changes announced in the March 7, 2012 CNE Report, and the materialization of those changes through the draft of Law 15/2012.1268 Conversely, Steag contends that, despite conducting reasonable and appropriate due diligence given the circumstances, the changes introduced by the NRR were not foreseeable.1269\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Spain), \u00b6 54.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Spain), \u00b6 65.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 85.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief \u2013 First Round (Spain), \u00b6 65; Post-Hearing Brief \u2013 Second Round (Spain), *\u00b6\u00b6* 84, 85.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), *\u00b6\u00b6* 51, 54.\n\n636.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, regardless of whether the investor could have anticipated general changes to the RRO, what was not foreseeable at the time of the investment was that those changes would apply to tariffs, premiums, and upper/lower limits for facilities such as Arenales Solar, which had already been registered in the Pre-Assignment Register. Moreover, while winds of regulatory change began to emerge in the first half of 2012, the precise scope of the reform to the economic framework for installations only became clear in 2013 and 2014. Even if one were to accept the premise that a diligent investor should have anticipated a change, it was not possible to predict the total elimination of the tariff, premium, and upper/lower limit criteria \u2014 which were critical to the profitability of Arenales Solar.\n\n637.\n\nSpain's conduct went even further. Spain not only altered the criteria for tariffs, premiums, and upper/lower limits established in Article 4 of RD 1614/2010, but it also replaced them with entirely new criteria, which did not exist in the regulatory framework in effect at the time of investment. A change of this magnitude requires, in any case, a justification beyond the mere invocation of public policy objectives. here must be a clear and plausible explanation for why the fixed tariff and premium system under the RRO was replaced with a remuneration system based on the costs of a \"standard facility\" per unit of installed capacity. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with Steag that it is unclear how the differential would be determined or what criteria would be used to adjust it.1270 The Claimant is also correct in pointing out that, to this day, it has never been clearly explained why the ten-year Spanish government bond rate was considered the appropriate benchmark for measuring capital costs in financial markets.1271\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 469, 470.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 143.\n\n638.\n\nIn this case, Spain created a reinforced expectation of stability through both the rules governing the Pre-Assignment Register, and the registration resolution of Arenales Solar, which explicitly stated that it \"*grants the economic regime regulated under Royal Decree 661/2007*.\"1272 This expectation was solidified in 2010, when Spain explicitly promised that tariffs, premiums, and upper/lower limits under Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 would be maintained. The stability of this framework was intended to last for the full operational life of the plant, provided that the definitive registration was completed before January 1, 2014. A new remuneration regime, radically different from that of RD 661/2007, which was fully applied to Arenales Solar, breached that expectation and constituted a violation of the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\nResolution of the Directorate General for Energy Policy and Mines registering the ARENALES facility, owned by ARENALES SOLAR PS, S.L., in the Pre-Assignment Register, granting it the regulated economic regime under Royal Decree 661/2007 of May 25, 2007 [**C-0009**].\n\n639.\n\nSpecifically, the legitimate expectation was breached by three measures: ***(i)*** The change in the adjustment method for the regulated tariff, which was no longer indexed to the CPI but instead to the underlying CPI (excluding energy product prices and unprocessed food); ***(ii)*** the reduction of the \"pool + premium\" option to zero, forcing a transition to a fixed tariff; and, finally ***(iii)*** the replacement of the pre-existing remuneration regime with an entirely new system, which determines profitability based on the \"*standard facility*\" hypothesis.\n\n640.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal did not find a sufficiently clear and specific claim regarding the alleged frustration of Steag's legitimate expectation due to the elimination of the ability to sell gas-generated electricity under the regulated tariff. Moreover, as previously stated, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to rule on the alleged violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT concerning the introduction of the TVPEE tax.\n\n3.2. Regulatory Stability in the Investment Framework\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n641.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Article 10(1) of the ECT, while not a stabilization clause, nonetheless protects investors from an \"*unreasonable and total change to the regulatory Framework.*\"1273 According to Steag, there is a \"*fundamental stability guarantee*\" regarding the \"essential characteristics\" of the legal framework in place at the time of investment.1274\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 226. See also Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 242, 409.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 231, 232.\n\n642.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in the Claimant's written submissions, these arguments are intertwined with the claims concerning the frustration of Steag's legitimate expectations. There is no sufficiently distinct legal argument.\n\n643.\n\nIn any case, this Tribunal has already found that Spain violated Article 10(1) of the ECT by frustrating Steag's legitimate expectations, which were founded on specific commitments made by Spain to the Arenales Solar installation. For this reason, it is unnecessary to analyze whether there could be a separate violation of the ECT in the absence of a legitimate expectation.\n\n**B. Full Protection and Security**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1. Claimant's Position\n----------------------\n\n644.\n\nThe Claimant makes a very brief reference to \"*the ECT provisions regarding the* [\u2026] *protection* [\u2026] *that the host State must grant to investments*.\"1275\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 204. See also \u00b6\u00b6 205, 206.\n\n2. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n645.\n\nThe Respondent replies to this reference to the obligation of protection, arguing that Spain has complied with its obligation to afford Steag full protection and security.1276 Spain emphasizes that the \"*most constant protection and security*\" standard in the ECT should not be taken out of context and cannot be understood as a guarantee of \"*stable, transparent, or reasonable conditions for the investor*,\" which are already covered by the FET standard.1277\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 974 et seq.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 976.\n\n646.\n\nThe Respondent highlights that Steag did not conduct a differentiated analysis of the two standards.1278 For the Respondent, the protection and security standard \u2014 in line with *El Paso v. Argentina* and *Electrabel v. Hungary* \u2014 should be understood as an obligation of due diligence to prevent and punish harm caused by third parties to the foreign investor, an obligation that the Claimant has failed to prove was breached.1279\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 977.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 978-980, referring to the case *El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15 (October 31, 2011) [**RL-0041**]. The Respondent also considers the case *Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary* [**RL-0048**] in this context.\n\n3. Tribunal's Analysis\n----------------------\n\n647.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not presented a sufficiently clear or differentiated argument regarding the full protection and security standard. The Respondent is correct in stating that Steag has not demonstrated a failure to provide protection and security to the investor within the terms of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n**C. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n1. Claimant's Position\n----------------------\n\n648.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, under Article 13 of the ECT, as interpreted by various tribunals,1280 an investment may be subject to direct expropriation when there is a clear impact on property rights, or to indirect expropriation when \"*a covert or incidental interference with the use of property has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in a significant part, of the use or the reasonable expectation of benefit from the property, even if it is not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State*.\"1281 Steag cites academic writings to explain that indirect expropriation may occur when the investor's right remains \"*legally intact but is deprived of the ability to use the investment in a meaningful way*.*\"*1282\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1 (August 30, 2000) [**CL-0051**]; Memorial of Claim, \u00b6 245.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 245, 246.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 247, citing Dolzer / Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law*, p. 92 [**CL-0052**].\n\n649.\n\nFor the Claimant, the key issue in these types of cases is determining in what situations an indirect expropriation occurs.1283 Tribunals analyze the facts on a case-by-case basis and weigh various factors, such as the severity of the deprivation of property rights or the economic impact on the investment.1284\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 247.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 247.\n\n650.\n\nSteag considers that, when examining the potential existence of an indirect expropriation, a tribunal should assess whether there has been: ***(i)*** a significant increase in taxes;1285 ***(ii)*** the revocation of free trade zone status;1286 ***(iii)*** the denial of necessary permits for conducting business activities;1287 or ***(iv)*** a breach of contract where government action renders contract performance more burdensome under discriminatory conditions.1288 As an example, it cites the cases *Pope & Talbot v. Canada*1289 and *CME v. Czech Republic.*1290 The Claimant concludes that the standard applicable to this case must be substantial deprivation of the investment.1291\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 248, referring to *Revere Copper v. OPIC*, Award (August 24, 1978) 56 ILR (1980).\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 248, referring to *Antoine Goetz et al. v.

The Kingdom of Morocco*, Decision on Jurisdiction, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4 (July 16, 2001) [**CL-0146**].\n\nIn *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Canada*, the tribunal held that, while a mere reduction in the value of the investment due to government regulation is not sufficient to declare an expropriation, the total deprivation of the value of the investment is.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 247, referring to Dugan C.F., Wallace D., Rubins N.D., and Sabahi B., *Investor-State Arbitration* (OUP 2008), p. 460 [**CL-0053**]. In *CME v. The Czech Republic* (which the Claimant refers to in \u00b6 250 of the Memorial of Claim), it was noted that there is a greater tendency to attribute some form of liability to the State when the residual value of the investment diminishes as a consequence of regulatory measures adopted by the State.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 497.\n\n651.\n\nThe Claimant's position is that the measures adopted by Spain have an effect equivalent to expropriation, as the NRR eliminated the entire value of Steag's investment in Arenales Solar.1292 To date, the Claimant alleges that it has derived no benefit from its shareholding in the company and has even had to contribute additional capital to the company due to reduced cash flows from operations.1293\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 481.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 481.\n\n652.\n\nThe Claimant argues ***(i)*** that Steag's investment is protected under the ECT against measures equivalent to expropriation, and ***(ii)*** that the NRR substantially deprived Steag of its investment.1294 According to Steag, Spain is wrong to claim that expropriated rights must be defined based on local law, focusing on the distinction between acquired rights and expectations under Spanish law.1295 The correct approach, according to the Claimant, is to define the expropriated rights based on applicable international law, which indicates that its investments are protected under Article 1(6) of the ECT.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 483.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 484.\n\n653.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that resolving this issue requires considering the creation of the pre-assignment registry in 2009, as \"*by registering in that registry, an investor could legitimately expect to receive financial support under the Original Regulatory Regime*.\"1296 The preamble and Articles 4(5) and 4(8) of RDL 6/2009 suggest that registration in the registry entailed recognition of the right to receive a specific remuneration.1297 The right to receive the premium is not merely hypothetical.1298\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 486.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 487.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 489.\n\n654.\n\nAccording to Steag, Spain's regulatory framework for the renewable energy sector is illogical, disproportionate, and contrary to good faith.1299 The Claimant argues that it is unacceptable for Spain to use its regulatory power to cease financially compensating thermoelectric energy companies while simultaneously benefiting from their operations.1300 The Respondent enjoys environmental benefits, benefits from the learning curve generated by solar power plants, gains from job creation, and benefits from greater energy and geopolitical security.1301 Steag stated that it was impossible to assume the regulatory risk that the effects of the measures would put an end to any economic benefits that could be expected under the RRO.1302\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 491.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 493.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 493.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 494. Steag cites the case ADC Affiliate Limited et al. v. Hungary [**CL-0061**] to support its argument.\n\n655.\n\nBased on the Partial Award in *Pope & Talbot v. Canada*, cited by the Claimant, regulatory measures may have expropriatory effects and constitute indirect expropriation.1303 Even if regulatory measures are classified as an exercise of the State's \"*police powers*\" or are adopted to protect the public interest, as Spain argues, they remain subject to judicial review for possible expropriatory effects.1304\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 495.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 495.\n\n656.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant explains that an investment may be indirectly expropriated if it is demonstrated that it has lost its economic viability.1305 In this case, the Tribunal must apply the standard of substantial deprivation of the investment.1306 Steag asserts that the NRR substantially deprived it of its investment by eliminating its economic rights stemming from the explicit recognition of its subsidiary, its inclusion in the Special Regime, and the financial support it previously received from Spain.1307\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 496.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 497.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 497.\n\n657.\n\nThe Claimant then proceeds to explain and demonstrate each of the reasons why it believes the NRR substantially stripped it of its investment.1308 Steag states that the direct effect of the regulatory measures on the investment was the reduction in cash flows,1309 which significantly limited the distribution of dividends among shareholders.1310 It highlights that some of the factors contributing to this reduction include Spain's lowering of the remuneration offered to the plant and the difficulty in renegotiating better financing terms with financial institutions.1311\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 498.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 498.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 498.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 498.\n\n658.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Spain has no factual or legal basis to support its assertion that the measures are not permanent or did not involve a transfer of assets (and therefore, according to Spain, did not affect or substantially deprive Steag of its investment).1312\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 499, 500. The Claimant also refers here to the argument that Steag did not conduct a specific case analysis to determine the existence of a substantial deprivation of the investment and deliberately omitted any mention of IP C-002, submitted alongside the Memorial of Claim.\n\n659.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant analyzes certain decisions of international tribunals,1313 which describe what constitutes a temporary measure versus a permanent one, and expresses reservations about the approach followed by those tribunals.1314 The mere temporariness of the measures should not be the relevant criterion for determining whether indirect expropriation has occurred; the fundamental question should be: Was Steag deprived of its investment?1315 The Claimant argues that the Tribunal \"*should adopt a standard that evaluates the actual effect that the State's regulatory power has had on the disputed investment*.\"1316\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 500, citing *Wena Hotels Ltd. v.

Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n661.\n\nSpain argues that the Claimant relies on an incorrect definition of the concept of indirect expropriation.1319 It incorrectly cites a series of arbitral awards that are not applicable to this case or fails to establish that the requirements or standards analyzed in those cases apply here.1320 Despite what Respondent characterizes as the Claimant's intentional confusion, the Respondent contends that there are no grounds to equate the effects of the measures adopted to an expropriation.1321\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1076.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1076, 1077.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1076, 1077.\n\n662.\n\nIn the Memorial of Claim, the Claimant acknowledges that the subject of the investment is \"*26.01% of the shares of the Spanish company Arenales Solar PS, S.L. ('Arenales Solar'), a limited liability company incorporated under Spanish law and the owner of the Arenales Project*.\"1322 Based on the assumption that Steag's investment consists of its shares in Arenales Solar P.S., the Respondent argues that the Claimant has not demonstrated: ***(i)*** that these shares grant a right to receive subsidies under RD 661/2007 indefinitely, and ***(ii)*** that Spain has substantially deprived the investor of its investment.1323\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1078.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1079.\n\n663.\n\nAccording to Spain, the Claimant selectively interprets Article 13(1) of the ECT by disregarding the absence of an expropriation object, as it omits two essential paragraphs required for a correct interpretation of the provision.1324 A full reading of Article 13(3) of the ECT indicates that the definition of expropriation is contingent upon the existence of a \"*property*\" or a property right capable of being expropriated.1325 Under this reading of Article 13(3) of the ECT, the expropriated party must \"*prove: (i) the existence of an expropriable right or asset under the law of the host State, (ii) its possession or ownership, (iii) a causal relationship between the measure adopted by the State and (iv) the impact of the measure on the ownership of the asset*.\"1326\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1080.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1081.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1081, 1082; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 1397.\n\n664.\n\nRegarding the first of these requirements, Spain states that \"*the Claimants [\u2026] have not 'patrimonialized' any right to obtain a return or to manage or administer the companies that own the Plants, but merely hold an expectation of future dividends and oversight over the management and direction of the entities*.\"1327 According to the Respondent, the Claimant's investment does not constitute an expropriable asset,1328 and in this case, it must demonstrate the expropriation of the shares, not the hypothetical returns or income from the CSP Arenales Plant.1329 Spain contends that Steag does not possess any right that could potentially be expropriated, only an expectation of future dividends that it assumed it would receive.1330 The Respondent cites various tribunal decisions1331 to support the argument that the law of the host State must be used to determine what rights or assets are subject to expropriation;1332 in this case, the relevant analysis concerns the rights conferred by shares in a commercial company under Spanish law.1333 Spain underscores that in none of the Claimant's submissions is there any reference to an expropriable asset or right: Steag simply asserts that it lost its investment, meaning the value of its shares.1334 Although Steag claims to have a right to subsidies under Article 36 of RD 661/2007,1335 the Respondent argues that the Claimant has never demonstrated any actual right to receive the alleged future subsidies.1336\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1401.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1082, 1083.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1084.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1084.\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., et al. v.

The Respondent finds no basis to consider the contested measures discriminatory.1352 Spain asserts that the non-discrimination requirement demands that a measure must not impact a single entity nor be directed at a specific group based on race, nationality, or similar factors.1353 In this case, it is established that the measures were applied across all sectors of society and all technologies under the special regime.1354 For these reasons, Spain does not accept the Claimant's assertion that the measures in question were disproportionate or unreasonable in relation to their intended objectives.1355\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1106; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Reply on the Merits, \u00b6 1414.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1107; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Reply on the Merits, \u00b6 1414.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1108, 1109; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1414, 1415.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1108-1109.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1108-1109.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1110; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1414, 1415.\n\n669.\n\nSpain contends that the adopted measures do not constitute indirect expropriation,1356 as none of them have expropriatory effects.1357 The Respondent argues that the ECT does not provide a definition of \"*expropriation*\" that clarifies the meaning of \"*measures having an effect equivalent*\" to expropriation.1358 To determine whether a measure has an effect equivalent to indirect expropriation, Spain submits that the test developed in arbitral practice should be applied, particularly under the ECT.1359 According to this test, a measure adopted by a State is equivalent to expropriation only when it prevents the investor from continuing to operate its investment, from using it, or when it significantly limits any property rights over the investment.1360\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1113.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1113.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1115.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1115.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1115-1116.\n\n670.\n\nSpain supports its position with the test applied in various international tribunal decisions.1361 These rulings establish that substantial deprivation occurs when there is a loss of control over the investment or a complete elimination of its economic value; adverse effects alone are insufficient.1362 The Respondent argues that despite the Claimant's assertion that it was deprived of its investment, it retained a 26.01% stake in Arenales Solar PS, S.L. until it sold its shares to Fronterasol, B.V. on December 12, 20191363 without Spain having intervened in its ownership in any way.1364\n\n*Electrabel S.A. v.

Tribunal's Analysis\n----------------------\n\n676.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Spain violated the FET standard through certain measures included in the NRR, specifically: ***(i)*** The adjustment of the regulated tariff based on the core CPI; ***(ii)*** The transition to a fixed tariff by reducing the \"pool + premium\" option to zero; and ***(iii)*** The introduction of a new remuneration scheme based on the concept of a \"*standard installation*.\" With respect to these measures, the Tribunal deems it unnecessary to analyze whether they also violate Article 13 of the ECT, as they already constitute violations of the FET standard.\n\n677.\n\nA violation of Article 13 of the ECT would only be relevant if the measures that did not breach the FET standard were found to have expropriatory effects. There are two such measures: The 7% tax on energy production, introduced by Law 15/2012. The Tribunal found that the claim regarding its alleged expropriatory nature is inadmissible, as Steag did not comply with the requirement under Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT.\n\n678.\n\nThe second measure for which no violation of the FET standard was found is the elimination of the possibility of selling gas-generated electricity under the regulated tariff. The Tribunal finds that the Claimant failed to present a clear argument regarding the expropriatory nature of this measure. Moreover, there is no evidence that it had an acquired right to the regulated tariff for gas-generated electricity.\n\n679.\n\nEven if these issues were disregarded, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant's central argument is that: \"*Spain's measures have an effect equivalent to expropriation: the New Regulatory Regime has eliminated the value of Steag's investment in Arenales Solar.

Any doubts are dispelled by the fact that the investor was able to sell its stake in Arenales Solar in a February 2020 transaction.1386 Steag states that it received EUR 9,422,027 from the sale, paid by RREEF.1387 When another investor in the same market is willing to invest in a project, it is clear that the project's economic value has not been eliminated Furthermore, in one of its submissions regarding the divestment transaction, the Claimant acknowledged that its contractual position \"*had undeniable implicit value*\" and that \"*this contractual position allowed Steag to obtain a more favorable consideration for its participation than it would normally have achieved.*\"1388\n\nCommunication regarding the transfer of STEAG GmbH's stake in Arenales Solar PS, S.L. to Fronterasol, B.V., February 4, 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3.\n\nResponse to Spain's comments on the Fronterasol and Steag transaction in Arenales Solar PS, S.L., February 20, 2020, \u00b6 4.\n\nResponse to Spain's Comments on the Fronterasol and Steag Transaction in Arenales Solar PS, S.L., February 20, 2020, \u00b6 14.\n\n681.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal does not find a violation of Article 13 of the ECT.\n\n**D. Umbrella Clause**\n----------------------\n\n1. Claimant's Position\n----------------------\n\n682.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Spain has breached the so-called umbrella clause contained in the last sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT. Steag confines the scope of application of the umbrella clause to the alleged \"*commitments*\" undertaken with it and its investment under the 'July 2010 Agreement' and RD 1614/2010.1389 According to Steag, the Respondent created in Steag the expectation that the regulatory framework would not undergo changes of the nature introduced since December 2012 \u2014 an expectation that enjoys specific protection under the last sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT.1390\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 237.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 352.\n\n683.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent's obligations or commitments may arise even in the absence of a contractual commitment, based on the general regulatory framework and unilateral declarations made by the host State.1391\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 351. The umbrella clauses included in investment protection treaties also safeguard commitments implicitly undertaken by a State through its political and regulatory actions, meaning that a contractual commitment, such as a concession, is not necessary to protect legitimate expectations (\u00b6 354).\n\n684.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Spain's interpretation of limiting umbrella clauses to obligations of a contractual nature is incorrect.1392 Steag refers to *LG&E v. Argentina*,1393 where the tribunal analyzed the possible coverage of obligations assumed by the Argentine Republic in promoting foreign investment under an umbrella clause.1394 The Claimant also discusses *Sempra v. Argentina*,1395 which found that the umbrella clause could extend to obligations undertaken by Argentina toward investors.1396\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 361. At this point, Steag notes that the State relies on an article by Professor T.W. W\u00e4lde (**RL-0055**). According to the Claimant, W\u00e4lde actually finds that the umbrella clause is not limited to contractual obligations (\u00b6 361). Citing the jurisdictional decision in *SGS v. Pakistan* [**CL-0110**], W\u00e4lde argues that umbrella clauses do not cover only contractual or consensual obligations but extend to obligations of all kinds (\u00b6 360), in such a way that their purpose is to \"*add to and expand the protection granted by an investment protection treaty*\" (\u00b6 361).\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp. et al. v.

Spain allegedly committed to maintaining the Original Regulatory Regime for solar thermal power plants.1397 The Claimant notes that in *Plama v. Bulgaria*, the tribunal specifically referred to the broad scope of Article 10(1),1398 concluding that the provision covers both contractual and statutory obligations.1399\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 364.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 365.\n\n*Plama Consortium Ltd. v.

Czech Republic*,1404 *Binder v. Czech Republic*,1405 *Toto v. Lebanon*,1406 and *Sempra v. Argentina*,1407 have held that a State can assume binding commitments to foreign investors through legal provisions.1408 Any obligation undertaken by the State is protected under Article 10(1) of the ECT and must be upheld.1409\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 368, 369.\n\n*Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. v.

Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n689.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's arguments regarding the alleged breach of the umbrella clause in the last sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT,1414 based on the supposed non-fulfillment of obligations allegedly undertaken by Spain through unilateral acts.1415\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1032; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Reply on the Merits, \u00b6 1356.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1357.\n\n690.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant's interpretation of the umbrella clause is incorrect, as it is neither faithful to the literal wording of the last sentence of Article 10(1),1416 nor aligned with the prevailing understanding of the umbrella clause in international arbitral practice and doctrine.1417 Moreover, Spain argues that it did not assume any vis-\u00e0-vis obligation toward the Claimant or its investment under the regulatory framework.1418\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1358.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1036.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1358.\n\n691.\n\nIn particular, Spain argues that the Claimant's interpretation of the provision omits an analysis of the term \"*entered into*\"1419 and wrongly assumes that RD 1614/2010 constitutes a commitment specifically agreed with it, concerning its alleged investment.1420 According to the majority view,1421 the term \"*entered into*\" requires the assumption of specific obligations by the State towards a particular investor or investment.1422 Spain contends that no source of specific obligations exists between Spain and the investor, as RD 1614/2010 is a general measure with *erga omnes* effects.1423\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1361.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1037-1039.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1040-1042, referring to *Noble Ventures, Inc. v.

Tribunal's Analysis\n----------------------\n\n696.\n\nThe Claimant states that: \"*[T]he most relevant academic works on this subject recognize that the so-called umbrella clauses in investment protection treaties also safeguard commitments implicitly assumed by a State through its political and regulatory actions, meaning that a contractual commitment, such as a concession, is not necessary to protect legitimate expectations*.\"1441 After referring to the origins of the umbrella clause, the Claimant frames its argument within the section on legitimate expectations, asserting that Spain's obligations constitute objective sources of its legitimate expectations in this case. Specifically, Steag says it had a legitimate expectation that the legal framework applicable to its investment would remain stable and would not undergo abrupt changes.1442\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 354.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 354.\n\n697.\n\nFor Spain, the Claimant's arguments cannot be upheld by the Arbitral Tribunal for two reasons. *First*, the Claimant's interpretation of the umbrella clause contradicts the literal wording of Article 10(1) of the ECT. *Second*, the Kingdom of Spain has not unilaterally undertaken obligations \"*vis-\u00e0-vis*\" the Claimant under RD 661/2007, Royal Decree-Law 6/2009, or RD 1614/2010, nor under any unilateral act. Spain further argues that no investment or commercial contract exists between the Claimant and the Spanish State, nor have the CSP special purpose vehicles signed any contract with the Respondent.1443 The obligation protected under the umbrella clause must be specifically undertaken with the foreign investor.1444 Spain concludes that RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 were not specifically directed at Steag nor did they express a commitment to freeze the regulatory framework applicable to its investment.1445\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1365.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1366.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1373.\n\n698.\n\nThe Respondent1446 agrees with the Claimant1447 on the importance of the literal wording of Article 10(1) of the ECT, which states:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an investor or an investment of an investor of any other Contracting Party.\"\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1360.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 367.\n\n699.\n\nBoth Parties agree that Article 10(1) of the ECT must be interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which establishes the customary international law rule on treaty interpretation.\n\n700.\n\nSteag presents its umbrella clause argument under the section titled: \"*Spain created in the Claimant the legitimate expectation that the regulatory framework for solar thermal energy plants registered in the pre-assignment remuneration register would not undergo drastic changes*,\"1448 specifically, in the subsection \"*(a) The legitimate expectations of an investor may arise from the general conduct of the State*,\"1449 which is dedicated to presenting the Claimant's argument on the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) standard and the sources of its legitimate expectations.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 349-411.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 349-370.\n\n701.\n\nThe investor mixes its allegation of breach of the umbrella clause with its allegation of breach of the FET standard. Regarding the umbrella clause, the investor asserts that Spain voluntarily undertook certain obligations to \"*stabilize*\" the regulatory framework through the agreement reached with the solar thermal sector representatives in the ER 2010 Communiqu\u00e9 and RD 1614/2010, and with the introduction of the NRR, Spain failed to comply with its commitment in violation of the final clause of Article 10(1) of the ECT.1450 In its argument about FET, the Claimant contends that RD 661/2007, the 2010 ER Communication, and RD 1614/2010, together with the registration of the Arenales Project in the pre-assignment registry, created an expectation that there would be no unjustified substantial changes to the project's remuneration.1451 The similarity between the two arguments is evident.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 366, 369, and 370.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 223, 237 and 238.\n\n702.\n\nIn the section on FET, the Tribunal found that the resolution registering the project in the pre-assignment register, in the regulatory framework defining its legal effects, particularly RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010, established a legitimate expectation of stability regarding certain elements of the RRO. These elements, as reiterated, are those listed in Article 4 of RD 1614/2010: ***(i)*** Tariffs; ***(ii)*** Premiums; and ***(iii)*** Lower and upper limits Furthermore, the Tribunal did not find that Steag had a legitimate expectation regarding the possibility of selling gas-generated electricity under the regulated tariff. The Tribunal also did not find a violation of the FET standard regarding the introduction of the TVPEE.\n\n703.\n\nThe Claimant's umbrella clause argument does not alter these conclusions regarding the violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT. Regarding the TVPEE, the Tribunal reaffirms its lack of jurisdiction over the claim concerning the alleged violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT due to this tax measure. Similarly, Steag did not demonstrate that the umbrella clause protected the ability to sell gas-generated electricity under the regulated tariff. The Tribunal finds that no distinct argument was presented regarding this measure.\n\n704.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal does not find it necessary or relevant to examine the discussion on the scope of the term \"*entered into*\" in Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n**IX. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n**A. Position of the Parties**\n------------------------------\n\n1. Claimant's Position\n----------------------\n\n705.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that the consequence of Spain's violation of the ECT is the obligation to compensate for the damage caused, in accordance with Article 31 of the Articles on State Responsibility. It explains the concepts of restitution and the alternative remedy of monetary compensation.1452 Steag asserts that the customary standard for compensation, based on the 1928 PCIJ decision in *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w*, applies to the compensation for each of its claims under Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT (except in cases where lawful expropriation is established).1453\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 252 and 261.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 262.

The Tribunal notes that this point is presented in a section related to the expropriation claim.\n\n708.\n\nThe Claimant explains that, for quantum assessment, it is necessary to compare the actual cash flows of Arenales Solar, and compare the hypothetical cash flows that would have been obtained in the absence of the NRR.1459 Steag quantifies its damages from June 20, 2014, as this was: \"*The date on which Spain definitively established the remuneration that would apply to the Plant as a result of the regulatory changes*.\"1460\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 270.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 271.\n\n709.\n\nThe Claimant states that its quantum assessment follows three steps. **First step** relates to the Capitalization of the hypothetical cash flows (without the NRR) and the actual cash flows (with the NRR).1461 From this, Steag identifies a loss of cash flows amounting to EUR 6.8 million and extraordinary expenses of EUR 45 million.1462 In proportion to Steag's stake in the project, this results in an amount of EUR 1.8 million for lost cash flows, to which EUR 11.8 million is added for early debt repayments.1463\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 273 and 275.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 274.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 275.\n\n710.\n\nThe **second step** consists of discounting the future cash flows, both from the hypothetical and the actual scenarios, which are subsequently compared at the Valuation Date in order to establish the real and hypothetical market value of the Plant.1464 The Brattle Report applies the \"Discounted Cash Flow\" (\"**DCF**\") method here.1465 The Report also takes into account certain elements that reduce the value of the investment, such as: ***(i)*** market risk, which is calculated based on information from publicly traded companies similar to Arenales Solar; ***(ii)*** regulatory risk, which reflects concerns about regulatory stability in Spain; and ***(iii)*** the illiquidity of the investment.1466 Based on this method, Steag's loss is quantified at EUR 83 million.1467 This figure was later updated to EUR 79 million.1468\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 276, 277.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 279.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 281, 282.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 283.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Steag), \u00b6 89; Additional Memorial, \u00b6 201.\n\n711.\n\nFinally, the **third step** consists of capitalizing the damages up to the date of the arbitral award.1469 Additionally, the amount of compensation must be adjusted to account for any applicable taxes.1470 Steag also requests recognition that the amount to which it is entitled accrues interest.1471\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 284, 285.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 285.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 286 and 288.\n\n712.\n\nIn response to the arguments presented by the Respondent and Accuracy regarding the alleged flaws in the DCF method, Steag asserts that this method is reliable and has been applied in other investment cases.1472 Steag emphasizes that Accuracy's analysis is incomplete because it questions Brattle's assumptions for the \"*but for*\" hypothesis (under the RRO) but not for the \"*actual*\" scenario (under the NRR).1473 For this, Steag refers to The Brattle Group's rebuttal report (**IP C-004**) and explains that the DCF method can be used in this context because the \"*abundance of historical data*\" and the \"*relative simplicity of the electricity production business*\" allow for the modeling of variables.1474\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 506 et seq. and 517 et seq.

According to that report, with the Measures in place, the entity liable for CIT would not be Steag but the shareholders of its sole shareholder (KSBG); the tax burden depends on the balance sheet of each KSBG shareholder and would be \"*potentially*\" 15.825%.1493 Regarding the TT, the taxable entity would be KSBG, not its shareholders, and the tax rate would be 16.8%.1494 This results in a total rate of 32.625%.1495 In the \"*cash flows through dividends*\" scenario, according to the Noerr Report, the cumulative marginal rate would also have been 32.625%.1496 The same report states that an impairment or amortization of the loans from Steag to Arenales could constitute a loss and reduce the taxable base.1497\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 195.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 195.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 195.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 196.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 196.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 196.\n\n719.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with these conclusions and explains that, in any case, Steag would be the taxable entity.1498 The Claimant begins by clarifying that Steag is subject to unlimited taxation in Germany and must submit its own tax returns.1499 What is transferred to KSBG is not Steag's income, but the taxable base (which may be positive or negative), in accordance with the \"*profit and loss transfer agreement*\" between Steag and KSBG.1500\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6\u00b6 198, et seq.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6\u00b6 200, et seq.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6\u00b6 201, 202.\n\n720.\n\nThe Claimant acknowledges that Steag is part of a \"*tax unit*\" for German tax purposes but notes that this does not mean taxes are calculated and accrued at the KSBG level. Each subsidiary makes certain adjustments, and then the taxable bases are integrated and transferred to the parent level.1501 As a subsidiary, Steag remains the taxable entity because it is responsible for trade taxes, meaning that if the parent company defaults on taxes, the tax authorities can demand payment from the subsidiary.1502 The tax adjustments at the subsidiary level generate a different treatment depending on the sources of income (dividends vs. potential award).1503\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6\u00b6 203, 204.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 205.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 206.\n\n721.\n\nSince the taxable base is determined at the subsidiary level, the Claimant argues that the treatment of income should be analyzed at the Steag level rather than at the KSBG level.1504 Under the RRO, there would have been cash flows to amortize Arenales' debt to Financial Entities and shareholders, as well as to distribute dividends among the shareholders of Arenales Solar PS, S.L.1505\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 207.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 209.\n\n722.\n\nThe dividends thus received by Steag 1 would be transferred to Steag GmbH and, under the German participation exemption regime, would be 95% tax-exempt.1506 This regime applies if there is a minimum 10% stake in the subsidiary for CIT purposes and 15% for TT purposes.1507 When dealing with a \"*tax unit*,\" the applicability of the participation exemption regime is analyzed at the parent level.1508 According to Steag, if the conditions set by German law are analyzed at the KSBG level, there would have been a 95% exemption for CIT and TT.1509 As a result, when calculating Steag's taxable base, only 5% of the dividends remitted by Steag 1 would have been considered.1510 The Claimant presents its calculations and notes that, taking into account the 16.8% TT that Steag assumes under its agreement with KSBG, the \"effective tax rate\" would be 1.631%.1511 The difference between the effective tax rate that would have applied without the measures and the rate resulting from a favorable award to Steag is 30.994%.1512\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 210.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 210.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 211.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 211.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 212.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 213.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 217.\n\n723.\n\nThe Claimant then addresses whether the taxable base could be reduced due to the accounting impairment of the loans granted to Steag 1.1513 According to the Noerr Report, a loan granted to a subsidiary by a parent that holds more than 25% of its capital is non-recoverable unless it was granted on market terms comparable to those a third party would have accepted.1514 The Claimant notes that the Noerr Report did not establish that these conditions were met in the case of the loans granted by Steag GmbH to Steag 1.1515\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6\u00b6 214, et seq.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 215.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 216.\n\n2. Respondent's Position\n------------------------\n\n724.\n\nSpain begins by explaining that the damage allegedly suffered by Steag must be established based on the models and impacts analyzed in the first and second economic reports by Accuracy.1516 The Respondent argues that the model proposed by Steag ignores the fundamental concept of regulatory useful life and disregards the overall consideration of cash flows over time to ensure a reasonable return on the investments made. The Respondent asserts that this approach should be outright rejected.1517 The estimated damages in the Brattle reports are not compensable, as they are speculative,1518 because the method used to calculate their amount depends largely on macroeconomic conditions that are unrelated to the measures and that will inevitably change over time.1519\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1166.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1170.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1419.\n\nFirst Economic Report on the Claimant and its Claim (Accuracy), \u00b6 105.\n\n725.\n\nThe Respondent cites the case *Gemplus v. Mexico*, where it was found that the investor bears the burden of proving the alleged damage and that, therefore, even if an internationally wrongful act is established that engages the international responsibility of the State, the Tribunal must dismiss a claim when the damages are uncertain, speculative, or the burden of proof has not been met for any other reason.1520\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1176; Rejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 1427; citing the case *Gemplus S.A. et al. v.

This calculation is based *\"on a simplistic comparison of scenarios ('actual' and counterfactual), assuming that the 'actual' will remain unchanged for the coming decades, ignoring that the guiding principle of the system is a guaranteed reasonable return*.*\"*1522\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 1177 et seq.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1172.\n\n727.\n\nThe Respondent relies on doctrine1523 and several arbitral decisions1524 that reject speculative methods such as the DCF method.1525 It argues that, in various cases, tribunals have used methods based on the analysis of the reimbursement of investments plus an appropriate return on their costs,1526 or have considered whether operational costs are recovered and whether a reasonable return is obtained.1527\n\nThe Respondent cites the works of Ripinsky / Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law* [**RL-0057**]; Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* [**RL-0058**]; y Sabahi, *Compensation and Restitution in Invesetor-State Arbitration* [**RL-0059**].\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1428-1432, citing *Rusoro Mining Limited v.

In particular, Spain mentions: \"*the contributory fault of the Claimant; the flow-through of the hypothetical damages; the tax gross-up; the incorrect determination of the valuation date; the possible overcapacity of the Claimant's solar thermal plant; the determination of the date and amount of the investment; or the inappropriate immunity against business risk*.\"1533 The result of the

observed that, regardless of the name given to the subsidy (FIT, premium option, Ri+Ro), the fundamental principles of regulation do not change; subsidies are designed to supplement market revenues in order to cover three components: operational costs, investment costs, and a reasonable return.1538\n\nFirst Economic Report on the Claimant and its Claim (Accuracy), \u00b6 79.\n\n733.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the plants generate an EBITDA of around EUR 28 million per year after the issuance of the measures, which translates to a reasonable return of a project internal rate of return (IRR) of 5.7% post-tax.1539 For the Claimant's plant, Brattle's But for model shows a post-tax return of 11%, which is compared to a cost of capital of 4.84%,1540 exceeding the reasonable return.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1439-1445.\n\nFirst Economic Report on the Claimant and its Claim (Accuracy), \u00b6 82.\n\n734.\n\nRegarding the criterion to be used to calculate interest between the valuation date and the award date, the Respondent argues that the 10-year bond should not be chosen but rather a bond with a term equal to the time gap between the valuation date and the estimated award date.1541\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6 1202.\n\n735.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the risks assumed by Steag and the corrections to some erroneous assumptions made by Brattle (useful life, attributing the effect of agreements with RREEF to Spain, pool-plus-premium option), the real impact of the measures on Steag's interests would be between EUR 3.8 and EUR 10.3 million, that is, up to 95% lower than the amount claimed by the Claimant.1542\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 1470.\n\n736.\n\nIn its closing arguments on damages, Spain calculates the resulting damage under different combinations of measures and useful life, depending on which measures are declared to be in violation of the ECT and which useful life is assigned to the plant.1543 In its closing arguments, the Respondent initially notes that the Tribunal requested the calculation of scenarios \"*under the assumptions of Brattle's quantum assessment model*\"1544 and emphasizes that \"*Brattle's model assumptions ignore the economic impact of STEAG GmbH's minority position relative to RREEF*\"1545 whose separate economic impact amounts to EUR 12.7 million.1546\n\nTable Showing the Separate Economic Impact of Each of the Challenged Measures Under the DCF Model Presented by the Claimant's Experts,

Respondent explains that, for the damage analysis under this methodology, the but for scenario should refer to the regulatory regime applicable before the first measure that the Tribunal finds in violation of the ECT.1549 This means that, for example, if it is found that the TVPEE is not contrary to the ECT or does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, \"*the counterfactual scenario must consider that this tax would also have existed*.\"1550 According to the Respondent, Brattle's experts do not object to this point.1551 Spain later explains the scope of the calculation requested from Accuracy, considering the effect of Law 15/2012, RDL 2/2013, and later measures.1552 Spain presents a table indicating what the damage would be if each measure were considered individually.1553 However, the Respondent notes that, if one or more measures are declared lawful, the sum of the individual economic impacts does not accurately represent the cumulative impact of the measures.1554 Spain then presents a summary prepared by Accuracy of the cumulative impact of the measures, in scenarios of a useful life of 40, 25, and 20 years.1555\n\nTable Showing the Separate

Respondent responded to the Claimant's arguments regarding the alleged fiscal impact in Germany of a favorable award to Steag. In its first brief, Spain refers to the Noerr Report, explaining that the two relevant taxes are the TT (16.80%) and the CIT (15.825%).1556 According to the State, the tax liability rests with KSBG for the TT and the limited partners in KSBG for the CIT.1557 According to the Respondent, the entire discussion revolves around the applicability of the dividend tax exemption regime.1558 For this regime to apply in Germany, certain requirements must be met, such as the payer's shareholding exceeding 10%.1559 The limited partners, the State argues, do not meet this requirement because none of them hold more than 19% of KSBG, which in turn only controls 26% of Arenales; thus, each limited partner holds no more than 4.94% indirect ownership of Arenales.1560 For these reasons, the exemption did not apply.1561\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Spain), \u00b6\u00b6 233-235.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Spain), \u00b6 236.

See also \u00b6\u00b6 245, 246.\n\n740.\n\nIn its second post-hearing brief, Spain argues that it is not true, as Steag claims, that the parties agree that a favorable award to Steag would be fully taxable as ordinary income.1562 The State explains that the Noerr Report states that there is no case law in Germany regarding the tax treatment of this type of income.1563 Therefore, such a payment might be considered a dividend, but it also might not be.1564 Reviewing Steag's criticisms of the Noerr Report,1565 the Respondent emphasizes that Noerr's conclusions did not assume that Steag was not a taxpayer in Germany.1566 Spain states that, beyond that, \"*the important point is that STEAG will not pay any tax, and that the tax on Arenales' dividends will be determined at the KSBG level for purposes of Trade Tax (\"TT\") and at the level of KSBG's partners for purposes of corporate income tax*.\"1567 According to the State, the differences between the Noerr and EY Reports stem from an incorrect application of German law in determining Steag's dividend income and the effects of its allocation to KSBG.1568\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 160.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 160.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 161.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 162, 163.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 164.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 165.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 167.\n\n741.\n\nSpain finds that, in the hypothetical scenario where the Measures had not been adopted, Steag's income would not have benefited from a 95% exemption, and an effective tax rate of 1.631% would not have applied, as the Claimant contends.1569 Regarding CIT, the reason is that, since Steag 1's shareholding in Arenales is 26.01%, \"*no KSBG partner holds an indirect stake of 10% or more in Arenales, which is the entity paying the dividends*.\"1570 Regarding TT, the Respondent argues that KSGB is a partnership and, therefore, does not meet the requirements for the application of the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive, which in turn means that the requirement of holding at least 10% ownership in Arenales is also not met.1571 For this reason, the applicable tax burden in the event of a favorable award to Steag would be the same as in the hypothetical scenario proposed.1572\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 169.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 171.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 171.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 172, 175.\n\n742.\n\nRegarding the possibility of deducting shareholder loans, Spain states that it is Steag's burden to prove that the loans complied with the arm's length principle.1573 The Respondent stresses that Steag is implying that this principle was not followed in the shareholder loan in this case, which would constitute a violation of the applicable regulations.1574\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 174.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Spain), \u00b6 174.\n\n**B. Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1. General parameters for determining compensable loss\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n743.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the Respondent violated the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT by frustrating the legitimate and objective expectations of the Claimant at the time of investment, which occurred on June 8, 2012. These expectations extended beyond a reasonable return. Steag expected that the tariffs, premiums, and upper and lower limits referred to in RD 1614/2010 would be maintained. This stability would have lasted for the useful life of the plant, provided that the final registration requirement before January 1, 2014 was met, which it was.\n\n744.\n\nThe frustration of Steag's legitimate expectations at the time of investment constitutes a violation of the FET standard, which, by engaging Spain's international responsibility, requires full reparation for the damages caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n745.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting that, as other tribunals have explained, Article 10 of the ECT does not establish a specific compensation standard applicable when a breach of its obligations occurs.1575 The Tribunal considers that, in this context, the general rule under Article 31 of the Articles on State Responsibility applies, which states:\n\n\"Article 31. Reparation.\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\"\n\nSee *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31 (June 15, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 659 [**CL-0130**].\n\n746.\n\nFor reparation purposes, the general principles developed by the PCIJ in its decision in the *Chorz\u00f3w* Factory case of September 13, 1928, apply:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act \u2014 a principle which seems to be established by international practice and, in particular, by the decisions of arbitral tribunals \u2014 is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the unlawful act and restore the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it \u2014 such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\"1576\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal. Original text: \"*The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act \u2013 a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals \u2013 is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it-such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law*\" (CPJI, Series A, No. 17, p. 47).\n\n747.\n\nThe burden of proving the damage rests on the Claimant.1577 In light of how the Parties have presented their arguments regarding Steag's damages and the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal considers that several relevant factors must be taken into account when determining the compensable harm: **(2)** the internationally wrongful measures attributable to Spain that are relevant to the damages analysis; **(3)** the date from which damages should be calculated; **(4)** Steag's contribution to the harm; **(5)** the effects of the 2020 divestment transaction; **(6)** the useful life of the Arenales Solar plant; **(7)** the tax gross-up; and **(8)** the methodology for calculating the compensable loss.\n\n*Gemplus S.A. et al. v. United Mexican States*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4 (June 16, 2010), \u00b6\u00b6 12-56, 13-80, and 13-81 [**RL-0075**].\n\n2. Internationally wrongful measures attributable to Spain relevant to the damages analysis\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n748.\n\nThe internationally wrongful conduct of the State must be the proximate and factual cause of the damage, in accordance with Article 31 of the Articles on State Responsibility.1578 The Tribunal has found that the Respondent violated the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT through the implementation of the NRR, particularly by: (***i***) adjusting the regulated tariff based on the underlying CPI; (***ii***) transitioning to a fixed tariff by reducing to zero the option of the premium plus pool; and (***iii***) introducing a new remuneration regime based on the assumption of a \"*standard facility*.\"1579\n\n*Ioan Micula et al. v. Romania*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20 (December 11, 2013), \u00b6 923 [**RL-0081**].\n\nParagraph 639 *above*\n\n749.\n\nThese measures do not include the TVPEE, which was not part of the Tribunal's merits analysis. The reasons for excluding the TVPEE are twofold. First, taking into account that the TVPEE is a \"tax measure\" under the parameters of Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT, the Tribunal concluded that it lacks jurisdiction over the alleged violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT due to the introduction of the TVPEE through Law 15/2012. Second, the Tribunal found that the claim regarding the alleged expropriatory effects of the TVPEE is inadmissible for failure to meet the requirement set forth in Article 21(5)(b) of the ECT. In light of the foregoing, any damages resulting from the TVPEE must be excluded from the determination of the compensable loss.\n\n750.\n\nThe damages analysis also excludes the elimination of the possibility of selling gas-generated electricity under the regulated tariff. In its merits analysis, the Tribunal did not find that Spain had violated Articles 10(1) or 13 of the ECT through this measure.\n\n751.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal reiterates that only those damages that Steag has suffered as a consequence of Spain's internationally wrongful conduct are compensable. Additionally, as will be explained in the next section, damages are calculated from the moment this change had an economic impact on Arenales Solar. According to the Claimant, this moment corresponds to June 20, 2014.1580\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 271.\n\n3. Date from Which Damages Should Be Calculated\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n752.\n\nThe Tribunal must determine the date that should be used as the reference for the quantum assessment of the compensable damage. The general rule, as stated by other tribunals, is that damages are calculated from the date of the injury resulting from the internationally wrongful act.1581 When the treaty violation results from multiple successive measures, the reference date for the quantum assessment of the damage is typically the date on which all relevant events have concluded, leading to an irreversible economic impact on the investment.1582\n\n*Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31 (June 15, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 581 [**CL-0130**].\n\n*Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31 (June 15, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 581 [**CL-0130**].\n\n753.\n\nBased on these parameters, the Tribunal finds that the amount of the compensable loss must be calculated from the moment Spain's internationally wrongful conduct had an economic impact on the Arenales Solar project. The Claimant identifies this date as June 20, 2014, when \"*Spain definitively set the remuneration that would apply to the Plant as a result of the regulatory changes*.\"1583 In the Brattle Damages Report, the experts indicate that \"*[S]teag's legal advisors instructed us to measure the present value of damages as of June 20, 2014, when Spain finally defined the applicable tariffs for Steag's solar thermal plant*.\"1584\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 271.\n\nClaimant - Brattle Report on Damages, \u00b6 11.\n\n754.\n\nThis date coincides with the publication in the Official State Gazette of Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, \"*approving the remuneration parameters for standard facilities applicable to certain electricity production facilities based on renewable energy sources, cogeneration, and waste*.\"1585 As stated in paragraph 161 above, Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 set the reasonable return rate applicable to facilities that existed prior to the entry into force of RDL 9/2013 at 7.398%.\n\nMinisterial Order IET/1045/2014, of June 16, 2014, approving the remuneration parameters for standard installations applicable to certain electricity production installations from renewable energy sources, cogeneration, and waste (\"**Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014**\") [**CL-0028**].\n\n755.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the moment when Steag's investment suffered an irreversible economic harm was June 20, 2014. Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 represents the culmination of the series of measures that led to the violation of the FET standard. It was at that moment, and not before, that the parameters of the NRR were concretely defined. Conducting an assessment prior to June 20, 2014, would require resorting to an artificial and retrospective valuation method. The economic effects of the NRR did not occur, nor were they determinable in a precise and certain manner, before that date.\n\n756.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal will set June 20, 2014, as the date from which the compensable loss should be calculated.\n\n4. Steag's Contribution to the Loss\n-----------------------------------\n\n757.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that Steag's investment date is June 8, 2012, at which time there was an expectation that Arenales Solar would retain the tariffs, premiums, and the upper and lower limits referred to in RD 1614/2010, for the facility's useful life.\n\n758.\n\nThe Parties have explained that, after June 8, 2012, Steag made multiple capital injections, which continued even during 2013 and 2014.1586 These capital injections occurred even after the measures comprising the NRR had begun to be gradually adopted.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 205, et seq.\n\n759.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, according to the Claimant's narrative, the Arenales Solar project lost its economic attractiveness with the introduction of the NRR.1587 This raises the question of whether, once the measures had been announced or adopted, the Claimant continued making significant capital injections because it had no alternative under the contracts it had signed, or whether it knowingly assumed a risk despite having options to mitigate or eliminate the potential loss caused by the measures it now challenges. In other words, the question is whether Steag's conduct constitutes a contributing cause to the loss it claims to have suffered.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 435.\n\n760.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by noting that the conduct of the party claiming to have suffered a loss, particularly its contribution to the damage or loss, is a widely recognized element in the analysis and quantification of compensable loss.1588 This follows from Article 39 of the Articles on State Responsibility, which states:\n\n\"Article 39. Contribution to the loss. In determining reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the loss by willful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or of any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.\"\n\nSee *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7 (May 25, 2004), \u00b6\u00b6 242, 243 [**CL-0039**].\n\n761.\n\nAs the tribunal in *Gemplus v. Mexico* stated:\n\n\"Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility excludes full or partial recovery when, through the intentional or negligent act or omission of the claimant State or person, that State or person has contributed to the loss for which it seeks reparation from the respondent State.\"1589\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal. Original text: \"*Article 39 of the ILC's Articles on State Responsibility precludes full or any recovery, where, through the willful or negligent act or omission of the claimant state or person, that state or person has contributed to the injury for which reparation is sought from the respondent state*\". *Gemplus S.A. et al. v. United Mexican States,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4 (June 16, 2010), \u00b6 11.12 [**RL-0075**].\n\n762.\n\nTo determine whether Steag contributed to the loss and to what extent, it is first necessary to assess whether the investor could have refused to continue participating in the project or making additional capital injections to avoid or mitigate the impacts of the NRR. The Parties have taken different positions on this matter.\n\n763.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the contracts signed in 2012 allowed Steag to exit the transaction and that, consequently, its decision to remain in it and make new contributions was a voluntary decision by Steag.1590 Spain contends that Steag's exit from the transaction in February 2020 confirms its interpretation.1591 According to the Respondent, the divestment was carried out in accordance with the terms agreed upon in 2012.1592\n\nPost-Hearing Brief \u2013 First Round (Spain), \u00b6\u00b6 53 and 113 et seq.; Post-Hearing Brief \u2013 Second Round (Spain), \u00b6\u00b6 8 et seq., 31 et seq., and 94 et seq.\n\nComments on the Claimant's communication of February 20, 2020, regarding Steag GmbH's divestment in the Arenales plant in favor of RREEF, February 26, 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 12 et seq.\n\nComments on the Claimant's communication of February 20, 2020, regarding Steag GmbH's divestment in the Arenales plant in favor of RREEF, February 26, 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 12 et seq.\n\n764.\n\nIn turn, Steag explains that its resources were committed from the outset and that the new contributions resulted from obligations undertaken in 2012 within a project finance structure.1593 According to the Claimant, divestment in 2013 or 2014 would have constituted a contractual breach and an act of bad faith.1594 Steag further asserts that the divestment carried out in 2020 was unrelated to the 2012 contracts.1595\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 205, et seq.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6\u00b6 69, et seq.\n\nResponse to Spain's Comments on the Fronterasol and Steag Transaction in Arenales Solar PS, S.L., February 20, 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 7 et seq.; Steag's Comments on the Absence of a Relationship Between the Transaction and Clause 2.1.6.(c) of the Shareholders' Commitment Agreement, March 5, 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 6 et seq.\n\n765.\n\nThe Tribunal will now analyze these arguments, taking into account the background and the project finance structure. In July 2011, structured financing was secured through a series of contracts that included investment agreements, financing arrangements, shareholder commitments, and guarantees.1596 One of the contracting parties was SMAG, which participated in the initial negotiation and structuring phase of the investment.1597\n\nInvestment Agreement between OHLI, SMAG, and RFEEF, dated July 28, 2011 [**C-0011**]; Counter-Guarantee Agreement (also referred to in different submissions as the \"Coordination and Guarantee Agreement\") [**BQR-011**]; \"Financing Agreement,\" dated July 28, 2011 [**BQR-018**]; \"Shareholders' Commitment Agreement\" of Arenales Solar, through which the shareholders assumed certain obligations towards the Members of the Banking Syndicate, dated July 28, 2011 [**C-0012**]; Eight Master Agreements for Financial Transactions (\"CMOF\") on Interest Rate Risk Hedging signed between the Project Company and the Members of the Banking Syndicate to mitigate risk associated with interest rate fluctuations [**BQR-020**].\n\nInvestment Agreement between OHLI, SMAG, and RFEEF, dated July 28, 2011 [**C-0011**]; Counter-Guarantee Agreement (also referred to in different submissions as the \"Coordination and Guarantee Agreement\") [**BQR-011**]; \"Financing Agreement,\" dated July 28, 2011 [**BQR-018**]; \"Shareholders' Commitment Agreement\" of Arenales Solar, through which the shareholders assumed certain obligations towards the Members of the Banking Syndicate, dated July 28, 2011 [**C-0012**]; Eight Master Agreements for Financial Transactions (\"CMOF\") on Interest Rate Risk Hedging signed between the Project Company and the Members of the Banking Syndicate to mitigate risk associated with interest rate fluctuations [**BQR-020**].\n\n766.\n\nOn December 21, 2011, SMAG filed for insolvency before the Insolvency Court of F\u00fcrth, Germany, which declared the insolvency by resolution on February 28, 2012.1598\n\nExpert Report prepared by Mr. David Ramos, p. 15.\n\n767.\n\nSubsequently, on June 8, 2012, a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) was signed between SMAG and Steag, whereby the former sold to the latter 26% of its shares in Arenales Solar for a sum of EUR 16 million. This initial contract was supplemented by the SPA Addendum on Risk Assumption, which set out the conditions that had to be met for the transaction to be completed.1599\n\nAgreement for the sale and purchase of certain shares and loans of Arenales Solar PS, S.L., dated June 8, 2012 [**C-0006**] and Additional Agreement to the SPA on Assumption of Risks, dated July 31, 2012 [**C-0024**].\n\n768.\n\nThe 2011 and 2012 contracts were part of a broader transaction. The SPA of June 8, 2012, explicitly states in Clause 1.5:\n\n\"The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement takes place in the context of a wider and more complex transaction [\u2026].\"1600\n\nAgreement for the sale and purchase of certain shares and loans of Arenales Solar PS, S.L., dated June 8, 2012, Clause 1.5 [**C-0006**].\n\n769.\n\nAs Steag has explained, project finance refers to the financing of an investment project, typically without recourse to the shareholders or, as in the case of Arenales Solar, with recourse to shareholders only during the construction phase, with the expectation that financing will be repaid through the project's own cash flows.1601\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 183.\n\n770.\n\nThe Respondent rightly argues that the investment process was not limited to the negotiation and execution of a few contracts. The design and structure of the investment reflect a strategic assessment and a complex structure involving distinguishable decisions at different points in time.1602 It is within this context that Steag's real options for exiting the project must be analyzed.\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 338.\n\n771.\n\nOn June 8, 2012, the parties agreed to take the necessary steps to fulfill the conditions set out in the SPA by July 4, 2012, and, if this was not possible, to extend the deadline again until July 16, 2012.1603 The SPA was a bilateral contract between Solar Millennium AG and Steag 1. A reading of Clause 1.5 of the SPA makes it clear that the fulfillment of these conditions depended on negotiations with banks and other sponsors, as well as the necessary approvals from Steag, the parent company of Steag 1.\n\nAgreement for the sale and purchase of certain shares and loans of Arenales Solar PS, S.L., dated June 8, 2012, Clause 1.1 [**C-0006**].\n\n772.\n\nIt is evident that Steag 1 could have declined to proceed with the transaction had it been unable to reach an agreement with third parties or if its parent company's governing bodies had opposed it. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that these conditions were not purely discretionary, as their fulfillment did not depend solely on Steag 1's will but also on third parties, including Steag GmbH.1604 In this sense, the Respondent is correct in stating that, under the SPA, any governing body of Steag GmbH could have halted the transaction.1605 This conclusion is reinforced by Clause 1.7 of the SPA, which provided:\n\n\"The Parties acknowledge that, unless otherwise stated by both of them in writing, the failure to complete any of the aforementioned steps will automatically render ineffective those steps which already had or could have been completed, and will oblige the Parties to do any such things or carry out any such acts which may be necessary to put the respective counterparty in the situation it was in prior to taking the first step of the Transaction, despite of the obligation of the Parties to conduct in good faith.

This contract restated the conditions that the parties had to meet for Steag 1 to assume SMAG's contractual position with all rights and obligations related to the transaction.1608 Through this contract, Steag undertook an obligation to make its best efforts to complete the transaction, as stated in the following terms:\n\n\"Each of the Parties expressly undertakes, provided that the anti- trust authorization or clearance and the approval by the lenders of the project financing of the Project Company for this transfer have been obtained, to complete the transactions contemplated in this Amendment Agreement to the IA and to execute the documents and take the actions on the Closing Date described in Clause 3.6 below, carrying out as many actions as may be required or convenient for such purpose.

Clause 3.4 of the same contract \u2014 signed just one month after the investment date \u2014 explicitly states:\n\n\"[\u2026] The breach of this obligation by any of the Parties would imply severe damages for the Project Company, its shareholders, and therefore for the viability of the whole project. In this regard **STEAG and STEAG 1 acknowledge the current financial crisis in Spain together with the economic measures being taken and to be taken by the Spanish government affecting the Project Company, its shareholders, and therefore the project. In this regard STEAG and STEAG 1 expressly agree that the referred crisis and measures shall under no circumstances be used by STEAG and STEAG 1 in order to avoid execute the documents** and take the necessary actions on the Closing Date as described in Clause 3.6 below1610\".\n\nPartial Subrogation Agreement and Amendment to the Investment Agreement between the original investors and STEAG 1 and STEAG, of July 31, 2012, clause 3.4 [**C-0019**] (emphasis added).\n\n776.\n\nIt is clear that, shortly after the investment date, Steag was already aware of the economic crisis, aware that Spain was going to adopt measures to address it, and aware that those measures could affect the Arenales Solar facility. Despite this, Steag chose to remain in the project and continue negotiations. Most importantly, it expressly waived invoking any measures adopted by Spain as grounds for abandoning the project.\n\n777.\n\nThe Parties agreed to extend the closing deadline until September 30, 2012,1611 as reflected in Clause 5 of the SPA Supplementary Agreement. The conditions were ultimately met in November 2012, when two contracts were formalized. The first was the Non-Extinguishing Amending Novation Agreement of the Financing Documents and Other Agreements,1612 which authorized Steag 1's subrogation into SOLAR's contractual position and recorded the parties' intention to novate certain clauses of the Shareholders' Commitment Agreement and other financing documents.1613 Clause 2.1.6(c) formed part of the modifications to Stipulation 2 regarding \"*shareholders' obligations*.\" This clause regulated the shareholders' obligation to make contributions under certain circumstances and established common rules for capital contributions.

Clause 3.1 of the 2013 Novation Agreement, August 2, 2013 [**BQR-018**].\n\n783.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether, under the contractual framework agreed upon on November 20, 2012, Steag could have exited the project to avoid these substantial additional capital contributions. As noted above, the point of contention is Clause 2.1.6(c) of the Non-Extinguishing Amending Novation Agreement of the Financing Documents and Other Agreements.1628 The text of this provision is as follows:\n\n\"2.1.6. Common Rules for Capital Contributions:\n\nThe capital contributions by the Shareholders governed by this Section 2.1 shall be subject to the following rules:\n\n[...]\n\n(c) Unless a specific deadline is set for the payment or the Borrower and/or the Agent establishes a specific deadline in a given case, in which case such deadlines shall be binding on the Shareholders, the Shareholders shall make these contributions to the Borrower no later than five (5) Business Days before the date on which the Borrower must make the corresponding payment, without the need for prior notice. The Shareholders may not justify non-compliance on the grounds of a lack of information regarding the Borrower's accounts or the extent of the Borrower's obligations to the Secured Creditors or any third party.\n\nIf, on any date on which the Shareholders should have contributed Equity to the Borrower pursuant to Sections 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 above, any of them has not made its required contribution as provided in the preceding paragraph, OHL INDUSTRIAL and FRONTERASOL shall be jointly and severally obligated to provide the Borrower, within five (5) Business Days before the date on which the Borrower must make the corresponding payment, with the Equity that the relevant Shareholder(s) failed to contribute.\n\nLikewise, if, on any date on which STEAG 1 should have contributed Equity to the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.1.2 above, as provided in the first paragraph of this Section (c), STEAG 1 has not made its required contribution, OHL INDUSTRIAL shall be jointly and severally obligated with STEAG 1 to provide the Borrower, within five (5) Business Days before the date on which the Borrower must make the corresponding payment, with the Equity that STEAG 1 failed to contribute.\"\n\nNon-Extinguishing Amending Novation Agreement of the Financing Documents and Other Agreements, of November 20, 2012, clause 2.1.6.(c) [**C-0020**].\n\n784.\n\nOn December 12, 2019, Steag reached an agreement to transfer its stake in the Arenales Solar project to Fronterasol B.V., a transaction that closed on February 3, 2020.1629 In this transaction, Steag received EUR 9,422,027 as consideration.1630\n\nCommunication regarding the transfer of STEAG GmbH's stake in Arenales Solar PS, S.L. to Fronterasol, B.V., February 4, 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3.\n\nResponse to Spain's comments on the Fronterasol and Steag transaction in Arenales Solar PS, S.L., February 20, 2020, \u00b6 4.\n\n785.\n\nIn its submissions, the Respondent has argued that this transaction demonstrates that, under Clause 2.1.6 of the Novation Agreement,1631 cited *above*, Steag had the option to unilaterally exit the operation.1632 For its part, Steag maintains that this clause did not grant a right to a unilateral exit and that taking such a step would have constituted a contractual breach.1633 Furthermore, the Claimant asserts that the aforementioned clause \"*had already become ineffective due to the passage of time*,\"1634 arguing that \"*Clause 2.1.6(c) of the Shareholders' Commitment Agreement ceased to have effect as soon as the various capital contribution obligations governed by Clause 2.1 of the Shareholders' Commitment Agreement expired*.\"1635 The Claimant adds that Clause 2.1.6(c) was rendered ineffective, in any event, by the Project Refinancing Agreement of November 22, 2018.1636\n\nNon-Extinguishing Amending Novation Agreement of the Financing Documents and Other Agreements, of November 20, 2012, Clause 2.1.6.

Rather, the clause provides a guarantee mechanism in the event that the referenced contributions were not made. The mere fact that an obligation is guaranteed by another contractual party does not in any way mean that non-performance of the obligation ceases to constitute a contractual breach.\n\n787.\n\nAlthough the 2020 transaction does not unequivocally indicate that Clause 2.1.6(c) allowed for a unilateral exit, the contractual conduct of the parties within the project finance framework does support the conclusion that there was room for negotiation and that the project structure was not as rigid as Steag claims.\n\n788.\n\nSteag stated that between February 4, 2013, and June 28, 2013, as its disbursements were being executed, it continued negotiations with financial institutions to ensure that the construction of the Arenales Solar plant would not slow down and that Arenales would continue to have access to the amounts provided for in the Financing Agreements.1637 Additionally, on August 2, 2013, a new Novation Agreement (**BQR-018**) was executed.1638 In the context of these or other negotiations, Steag could have attempted to negotiate its exit from the project or agree on clauses that would have mitigated its financial impact in light of the measures being taken by the Respondent that affected the project. However, there is no indication that Steag ever raised with the other contracting parties the possibility of withdrawing from the project, reducing its stake, or modifying the financial model to mitigate the impact it now claims.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 214, 215.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 215.\n\n789.\n\nThe existence of a negotiation margin is ultimately evidenced by the fact that Steag was able to agree to a divestment between 2019 and 2020, receiving a significant sum for its stake in the Arenales Solar project. Steag itself says in its submission dated February 20, 2020:\n\n\"**[S]teag's contractual position had undeniable implicit value** because any third-party acquirer would have been required to agree with Steag on numerous aspects of the management of the Arenales Project. If Steag's contractual position had no particular value, as Accuracy argued to justify a reduction in damages, RREEF would not have made any offer to Steag and would have simply transferred its share to the third party without considering Steag. The reality is that Steag's **contractual position allowed it to obtain compensation for its stake** that was more favorable than it would have normally secured. Notably, RREEF paid the indicated price in a single payment, with no possibility of future adjustments.\"1639\n\nResponse to Spain's Comments on the Fronterasol and Steag Transaction in Arenales Solar PS, S.L., February 20, 2020, \u00b6 14. (emphasis added).\n\n790.\n\nThis is particularly significant given that, according to the Claimant, the approval of RDL 17/2019 of November 22, 2019, continued to affect its contractual position.1640 In this context, Steag refers to \"*the greater damages that Arenales would suffer due to the lower remuneration it will receive as a result of this new modification of the New Regulatory Regime*.\"1641\n\nSteag's Comments on the Lack of Relationship Between the Transaction and Clause 2.1.6.(c) of the Shareholders' Commitment Agreement, March 5, 2020, \u00b6 11, 12.\n\nSteag's Comments on the Lack of Relationship Between the Transaction and Clause 2.1.6.(c) of the Shareholders' Commitment Agreement, March 5, 2020, \u00b6 12.\n\n791.\n\nIn other words, according to Steag's own account, its situation in 2020 was worse than it was between 2013 and 2014. However, despite this, its stake still retained an \"*implicit value*\" for which another investor was willing to pay compensation. Even more so, before the adoption of RDL 17/2019, it should have been possible to negotiate an exit from the project. If Steag did not find this course of action convenient and did not even attempt to initiate such negotiations at that time, it cannot now expect Spain to bear the consequences of its decision.\n\n792.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the project finance documents constituted, as the Claimant asserts, a kind of \"*straitjacket*\" from which it was impossible to escape. First, as the Claimant itself affirmed when discussing the sale of its stake in Arenales Solar, Steag's contractual position had value. Second, there is no evidence that the Claimant, either directly or with the cooperation of its partners, attempted to renegotiate or restructure the project to reduce the impact on Arenales Solar. Neither the contractual clauses, the financing structure, nor the project's expected cash flow prevented the Claimant from diligently seeking a revision of the economic model or adjusting cash flows to mitigate the impact of the measures. No project finance arrangement is immutable, and they are generally adjustable when conditions affecting cash flow arise. However, the Tribunal has not been informed of any efforts by the Claimant to renegotiate agreements or implement measures that would have mitigated or eliminated the impact on the project's structure. The Respondent should not have to bear the full consequences of the Claimant's financing structure when the latter failed to make the necessary efforts to negotiate a modification.\n\n793.\n\nEven if one accepts that the 2012 contracts were indeed a rigid \"*straitjacket*,\" forcing Steag to continue making capital contributions with little to no room for negotiation, the fact remains that these contracts were freely negotiated by Steag. As noted above, on July 31, 2012, in Clause 3.4 of the Partial Subrogation Agreement and Amendment to the Investment Agreement between the original investors and STEAG 1 and STEAG,1642 Steag expressly acknowledged the existence of an economic crisis and the risk that measures could be adopted that would affect the Arenales Solar project. Aware of this risk, it explicitly waived the right to invoke it as a reason to withdraw from the negotiations. If the contracts signed at the end of 2012 genuinely did not allow for Steag's unilateral exit and forced it to continue injecting funds, despite its investment allegedly becoming \"*completely worthless*,\"1643 then the responsibility for that structure rests with Steag.\n\nPartial Subrogation Agreement and Amendment to the Investment Agreement between the original investors and STEAG 1 and STEAG, dated July 31, 2012, clause 3.4 [**C-0019**].\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6 268.\n\n794.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that while Spain breached the FET standard by introducing a regulatory regime radically different from the RRO \u2014 frustrating the expectations that Spain itself had created for Steag at the time of its investment \u2014 the financing structure that Steag negotiated also played a role in the damage suffered. Steag was part of ongoing negotiations after the investment date, during which the project's financing was structured. Due to the way it structured the project finance, Steag made multiple capital injections between the second half of 2012 and 2014, even when Spain's measures had already been announced or implemented. The Tribunal cannot overlook the fact that part of the loss the Claimant alleges to have suffered resulted from how Steag handled the successive negotiations of the project finance.\n\n795.\n\nThe consequence of Steag's contribution to the loss is a reduction in the amount of compensation. The Tribunal enjoys broad discretion in determining the percentage by which the compensation is reduced.1644 In other cases, reductions have been, for example, 25%1645 or 50%.1646\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11 (October 5, 2012), \u00b6 670 [**CL-0040**].\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11 (October 5, 2012), \u00b6 687 [**CL-0040**].\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7 (May 25, 2004), \u00b6 243 [**CL-0039**].\n\n796.\n\nThe Tribunal, having analyzed all the circumstances of the case and within the scope of its discretion, finds that Steag's contribution to the injury can be quantified at 25%. This percentage reflects Steag's factual partial contribution to the total amount of the damage while also recognizing the severity of Spain's conduct as the primary cause of the damage suffered. Consequently, once the total amount of damages suffered by the investor is determined, the Tribunal will proceed to reduce the compensable amount in the indicated proportion.\n\n5. Impact of the 2020 Divestment\n--------------------------------\n\n797.\n\nThe Tribunal must take into account Steag's sale of its stake in Arenales Solar, which, according to the Claimant, took place in February 2020.1647 In its Reply Memorial, Steag asserted that, as a result of Spain's actions: \"*[T]he plant's operating profit is substantially reduced, preventing the distribution of free cash flows to shareholders and preventing the Claimant from recovering its investment. The renegotiation of Arenales Solar's shareholders with the Financial Entities becomes difficult, preventing an extension of the repayment period for loans granted for the Plant's construction or a reduction in the applicable interest rate, which would allow the release of sufficient cash flows to provide remuneration to Arenales Solar's shareholders. **The liquidity of Steag's position in Arenales Solar is reduced, its fair market value is reduced to EUR 0 under a discounted cash flow analysis, and thus, Steag is prevented from limiting its losses by selling its position to a potential investor***.*\"*1648\n\nCommunication regarding the transfer of STEAG GmbH's position in Arenales Solar PS, S.L. to Fronterasol, B.V., February 4, 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 504 (emphasis added). The Tribunal notes that this point is presented in a section related to the expropriation claim.\n\n798.\n\nGiven the way damages were alleged and Steag's claim that its stake's market value was EUR 0, the Tribunal cannot ignore that the investor was able to sell its stake in Arenales Solar in the February 2020 transaction,1649 obtaining \u2014 as the Claimant itself admits \u2014 a sum of EUR 9,422,027 for it, which was paid by RREEF.1650 In one of its submissions on the matter, previously cited, the Claimant acknowledged that its contractual position \"*had undeniable implicit value*\" and that, moreover, \"*Steag's contractual position allowed it to obtain a more beneficial compensation for its stake than it would normally have obtained*.*\"*1651\n\nCommunication regarding the transfer of STEAG GmbH's stake in Arenales Solar PS, S.L. to Fronterasol, B.V., February 4, 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3.\n\nResponse to Spain's comments on the Fronterasol and Steag transaction in Arenales Solar PS, S.L., February 20, 2020, \u00b6 4.\n\nResponse to Spain's Comments on the Fronterasol and Steag Transaction in Arenales Solar PS, S.L., February 20, 2020, \u00b6 14.\n\n799.\n\nThe Tribunal must therefore deduct from the compensable loss the amount Steag received for its stake in Arenales Solar.\n\n6. Useful Life of the Arenales Solar Plant\n------------------------------------------\n\n800.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with the Parties that the regulatory useful life of the plants is a key parameter for calculating the economic regime of the investments and, consequently, the damage. As indicated in the analysis of the Claimant's legitimate expectation, Steag could reasonably expect that the Arenales Solar facility would be subject to the economic regime under RD 661/2007 for the duration of its useful life.\n\n801.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Parties have discussed prior arbitral decisions, in which the useful life of the respective plants was found to be 25 years.1652 The Claimant has emphasized that this case is different from previous ones.1653 According to Steag, the key difference is that those awards did not establish proof that the respective plants would operate for more than 25 years, and they highlighted the high maintenance costs as a factor to consider.1654\n\nHearing, Day 1, 87:19-22 (D\u00edaz de la Cruz); 175:1-3 (Fern\u00e1ndez Castilla).\n\nHearing, Day 1, 87:21-22 and 88:1-3 (D\u00edaz de la Cruz)\n\nHearing, Day 1, 180:14-22 and 181:1-3 (Fern\u00e1ndez Castilla). See Reports, Professor Servert [**JSRC-16** and **JSRC-17**].\n\n802.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Steag that each case is unique. The useful life of Arenales Solar for the purposes of damage calculation must be estimated based on the available data for that specific plant, considering how the investment was structured.\n\n803.\n\nThe Parties and their experts disagree on the useful life of the Arenales Solar Plant, which must be taken into account for the damage calculation. The estimates presented to the Tribunal range from 20 to 40 years. For instance, the Brattle Report of May 26, 2017, suggests that the useful life of the Arenales Solar Plant would reach 40 years.1655 In this regard, the experts explain:\n\n\"Our analysis assumes that *Arenales* could operate for 40 years without requiring significant investments. The RRO provided incentives for continued operation beyond 25 years, as economic support decreased by a relatively modest 20% after that point. The sharp decline in projected revenues after 2038 in the actual scenario reflects the effective closure of *Arenales*.\"1656\n\nEconomic Damages Suffered by Steag (Brattle), \u00b6\u00b6 69, 70, and No. 57.\n\nEconomic Damages Suffered by Steag (Brattle), \u00b6 69 (footnote omitted).\n\n804.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find that the useful life of the Arenales Solar plant is 40 years, not even from a technical perspective. The Tribunal has carefully considered the arguments put forward by Mr. Schneider to justify the calculation of a 40-year useful life. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that a 40-year useful life can be considered for the purposes of damage calculation. First, in the hearing, Mr. Schneider himself explained that his calculation was based on the plant's cycles, which is a variable criterion. In his own words: \"*A cycle could last 1 hour or could also last 3 days, for example*.\"1657 Furthermore, Mr. Servet emphasized that, even from a technical perspective, it has not been proven that the Arenales Solar Plant will operate for 40 years. Mr. Servet pointed out that: \"*While cycles are important, they are not the only determining factor for the life of equipment*. *The operating temperature, corrosion, normal wear and tear, and \u2014 as my colleague mentioned \u2014 how start-up and shutdown cycles are conducted, all play a very important role*.\"1658 Considering certain uncertainties and technical defects, Servet even suggests a useful life of only 20 years.1659 His conclusion was: \"*The plant was designed for 25 years, and it should have lasted 25 years, but with all the engineering problems \u2014 with equipment, construction, operation, and maintenance \u2014 the best estimate I can give is 20 years*. *This plant has not been properly operated, maintained, or even built correctly, and that will have consequences*.\"1660\n\nHearing, Day 3, 792: 11-12 (Schneider).\n\nHearing, Day 3, 864:5-11 (Servet).\n\nHearing, Day 3, 870:13-15; 873:6-11; 878:1-4; 884:22 and 885:1-7 (Servet).\n\nHearing, Day 3, 884:22 y 885:1-7 (Servet).\n\n805.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, although the experts disagree on the number of years the Arenales Solar Plant will operate from a technical standpoint, there is no doubt that the plant was designed to operate for 25 years.1661 Additionally, even if the plant were technically capable of operating for a longer period, the fixed tariff was granted for 25 years. Moreover, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Arenales Solar Plant was designed to have a useful life of 25 years.1662\n\nHearing, Day 3, 855:18-22 (Servet) (\"The design criterion is what this plant was designed for, for how many years, and in that I believe both experts agree: the design criterion is 25 years, the quality of design.\") See also Hearing, Day 3, 863:1-10 (Servet).\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Spain), \u00b6 262.\n\n806.\n\nFor damage calculation purposes, a 25-year useful life is appropriate not only because it aligns with the plant's design, but also because it was the reference period consistently used for economic and financial calculations regarding the project. In this regard, the Accuracy report is correct when, challenging the starting point of the Brattle Report, it explains that a 25-year useful life for the plants would be a \"*conservative figure*,\" far more appropriate than 40 years.1663 Accuracy argues that there is no justification for assuming a 40-year useful life assuming the RRO remained in place (But for scenario).1664 Accuracy draws attention to several factual element:1665\n\n(i) According to Arenales' annual accounts, the depreciation calculation assumed a 25-year useful life.1666 Likewise, the EPC contract was based on a 25-year useful life.1667\n\n(ii) Something similar occurred with the investment report, as the IRR of the project was based on a useful life calculated between 20 and 25 years.1668\n\n(iii) A 2012 technical report, cited in Arenales Solar's annual accounts, also indicated a useful life of 25 years.1669 The excerpt from the annual accounts states: \"*The company depreciates its fixed assets from the date of commissioning using the straight-line method, distributing the cost of the assets over the estimated useful life \u2014 which, according to a technical study conducted by an independent expert in 2012, amounts to 25 years for all assets*.\"1670\n\n(iv) Accuracy considers a 25-year useful life for the Arenales Plant in both the actual and but for scenarios, as the most reasonable maximum horizon.1671 In the actual scenario, the rate of return was calculated at 7.398% pre-tax, the rate established in RDL 9/2013, applied over a 25-year useful life.\n\nFirst Economic Report on the Claimant and its Claim (Accuracy), \u00b6 145(c).\n\nFirst Economic Report on the Claimant and its Claim (Accuracy), \u00b6 145(c).\n\nFirst Economic Report on the Claimant and its Claim (Accuracy), \u00b6 145(c).\n\nArenales' Annual Accounts [**BQR-03**].\n\nEPC Contract for the Construction of the Plant with Ecolaire Espa\u00f1a S.A., dated July 28, 2011, p. 18 [**C-0013**].\n\nProject Presentation by Directors to the Board of Directors, p. 21 [**C-0018**].\n\nArenales' Annual Accounts [**BQR-03**].\n\nArenales' Annual Accounts [**BQR-03**].\n\nFirst Economic Report on the Claimant and its Claim (Accuracy), \u00b6 26.\n\n807.\n\nIn the hearing, this consistent reference to a 25-year useful life was justified by the difference between the \"*technical*\" and \"*economic*\" useful life of Arenales Solar. As Mr. Ponce de Le\u00f3n stated: *\"**We have a 25-year tariff, and as of today, we cannot amortize the asset beyond that tariff**, which is our justification for tax purposes, as recognized by Hacienda (Spanish tax authorities), for the plant's useful life. Because technical useful life is one thing, but economic useful life is another. Obviously, if we don't have a tariff that can support the costs at that time, we won't be able to keep operating the plant. That's why we are accounting for and amortizing it fiscally over 25 years*.*\"*1672 In other words, even the Claimant never assumed that the asset would be amortized over 40 years.\n\nHearing, Day 1, 349:6-18 (Ponce de Le\u00f3n) (emphasis added).\n\n808.\n\nFor this Tribunal, it is essential that even the Claimant did not expect the RRO remuneration to extend beyond 25 years. This arbitration concerns the transition from the RRO to the NRR and its effects on Steag's investment.1673 In the hearing, it became clear that Steag never expected, based on the legislation in force in Spain at the time of its investment, to receive remuneration under the RRO for more than 25 years. According to Mr. Rumstadt's statement regarding the legal due diligence: \"*I was told that this was a solid norm with legal standing that would provide us with significant comfort for an investment that would last for 25 years, during which we would receive the tariff as proposed in the three aforementioned decrees*.*\"*1674 Mr. Rumstadt also explained that *\"it is typical to see these projects structured for a 20-year term, and in this case, it was an advantage for us to expect a 25-year term for this feed-in tariff*.\"1675 The feed-in tariff was calculated based on 25 years.1676\n\nIn the case of the NRR, Article 5 of Order IET/1045/2014 [**R-0229**] determines the regulatory useful life of standard installations in a table, with values ranging from 20 to 30 years. For most types, the regulatory life is 25 years.\n\nHearing, Day 1, 299:4-14 (Rumstadt).\n\nHearing, Day 1, 305:5-13 (Rumstadt).\n\nHearing, Day 1, 322:13-22 and 323:1-2 (Rumstadt).\n\n809.\n\nLikewise, in his witness testimony, Mr. Daniel Voswinkel admitted that, under the RRO, the internal rate of return for Arenales Solar was calculated based on an assumed useful life of 25 years:\n\n\"Investment decisions within STEAG are based on the achievable internal rate of return, using the discounted cash flow calculation method. As a general internal practice at STEAG, projects are initially calculated based on a conservative assumption of a 20-year lifespan, ignoring the actual technical and economic life of a power plant. **However, the Original Regulatory Regime was fully applicable during the first 25 years of operation. We considered this relevant. The internal rate of return calculated for the Arenales Project was based on a 25-year lifespan,** and the regulated tariff with a premium led to an internal rate of return of 12.5%. Additionally, Spain's original commitment to providing financial support for gas combustion up to 15% of production was taken into account. STEAG engineers informed me that the technical lifespan of the Arenales Plant is estimated to be around 40 years. The remaining 15 years are considered a supplement to the originally projected IRR.\"1677\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Daniel Voswinkel, dated May 10, 2018, \u00b6 31 (emphasis added).\n\n810.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that it has not been proven that the Arenales Solar plant has a useful life of 40 years. What is established, however, is that the investment was projected based on a useful life of 25 years. The Tribunal therefore concludes that, for the purposes of determining the compensable loss, a useful life of 25 years should be used as the basis.\n\n7. The Tax Gross-Up\n-------------------\n\n811.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the Claimant's argument regarding the alleged damages resulting from the \"*tax impact of the award payment*.\"1678 The core of the Claimant's argument is that \"*[\u2026] based on the principle of full compensation for the losses and damages suffered by Steag, receiving cash flows through dividends and loan amortization is not the same as receiving them through a potential award granting compensation*.\"1679 According to the Claimant, *\"[w]hile the first option receives a specific tax treatment, the second is subject to a different taxation*.\"1680 The State has opposed this claim and has contested the investor's reasoning.1681\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6\u00b6 191, et seq.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 192.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 192.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Steag), \u00b6\u00b6 172, 175.\n\n812.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties have supported their positions on this issue with two reports. Steag bases its claim on a report by Ernst & Young GmbH (Exhibit **BQR-056**).1682 According to the Claimant, \"*income received through dividends distributed by Arenales Solar PS, S.L. would have been taxed at an effective rate of 1.631%. However, in the real scenario, the income that might be received as a result of a favorable award for Steag would be fully taxed, resulting in an effective tax rate of 32.625%*.*\"*1683\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 191.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - First Round (Steag), \u00b6 217.\n\n813.\n\nIn turn, Spain opposes the investor's conclusions based on a report prepared by the firm Noerr (Exhibit **ACQ-0062**). Based on that report, the State argues that \"*[t]he conclusion that the 'But for' scenario would be equal to the 'Actual' scenario, even assuming (but not accepting, as STEAG suggests) that any potential compensation awarded by the Tribunal would be taxed as ordinary income, is incorrect*.\"1684 According to the State, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n\"(i) Either the compensation is considered a payment equivalent to a dividend (which it is from an economic perspective), in which case a \"tax gross-up\" would automatically not apply, because the \"Actual\" and \"But for\" scenarios would be treated the same from a tax perspective; or (ii) it is considered ordinary income, subject to standard tax regulations, in which case we need to analyze what the tax treatment of dividends would have been in the 'But for' scenario, as Noerr did in its report. As the Tribunal may recall, Noerr concluded that, due to certain tax rules, dividends (in the 'But for' scenario) would not benefit from a tax exemption and would therefore be taxed as ordinary income.\"1685\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Steag), \u00b6 162.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Steag), \u00b6 161.\n\n814.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the burden of proving the damage rests with Steag.1686 This burden applies not only to proving the existence of damage but also to quantifying it. It is the Claimant's responsibility to demonstrate the alleged loss resulting from the \"*tax impact of the award payment*\" that would, in its view, justify a \"*tax gross-up*.\"\n\n*Gemplus S.A. et al. v. United Mexican States*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4 (June 16, 2010), \u00b6\u00b6 12-56, 13-80, and 13-81 [**RL-0075**].\n\n815.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Spain has not met this burden. Having carefully considered the Parties' arguments and reviewed the submitted reports, the Tribunal concludes that the loss alleged by Steag is uncertain. The investor's argument is based on contingent hypotheses and interpretations of the applicable tax laws that are not free from controversy, as revealed by the Noerr Report. According to that report, \"*[t]here is no case law on the tax treatment in Germany of an award issued under the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\") such as the present case*.\"1687 Spain is therefore correct in arguing that \"*there is legal uncertainty that could be resolved in opposing directions by future rulings of the German tax courts*.\"1688\n\nNoerr Report [**ACQ-0062**], pp. 4, 9.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Steag), \u00b6 161.\n\n816.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal will not grant the tax gross-up requested by the Claimant.\n\n8. Calculation of Compensable Loss: Methodology\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n817.\n\nThe Parties have extensively debated the most appropriate method for calculating damages. As previously explained, the Claimant presents its damage calculation based on the DCF method, comparing the actual cash flows of Arenales Solar (Actual scenario) with the hypothetical cash flows that would have been obtained in the absence of the NRR (But for scenario).1689 The Claimant arrives at a figure of EUR 79 million,1690 plus any amounts corresponding to capitalization of that amount until the date of the award, applicable taxes, and interest.1691\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 270 and 275.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - Second Round (Steag), \u00b6 89; Additional Memorial, \u00b6 201.\n\nMemorial of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 284 and 288.\n\n818.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the damages claimed by Steag are \"*completely and utterly speculative*.\"1692 According to the Respondent, the DCF method is not applicable to every factual situation and is inappropriate in the present case.1693 The Respondent goes further, claiming that \"*Brattle's DCF is flawed, and once corrected, the result would be no damages*.\"1694 Spain asserts that \"*the Claimant attempts to support its claim based on a simplistic comparison of scenarios (\"Actual\" and \"But for\"), assuming that the \"Actual\" scenario will remain unchanged for decades, while ignoring that the guiding principle of the system is the guaranteed reasonable return. Among other things, its models attempt to predict variables such as the pool price (which depends on oil prices) and energy demand. For all these reasons, projecting current parameters is hypothetical and unrealistic*.\"1695 Spain argues that damages should instead be assessed based on the Adjusted Book Value (ABV) method, which is structured around investment returns in a regulated market.1696 Under this method, the annual cash flow of an asset is determined based on the investment amount and the expected rate of return.1697\n\nRejoinder and Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 58.

Kingdom of Spain,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31 (June 15, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 688 [**CL-0130**].\n\n*Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. et al. v. Kingdom of Spain,* Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31 (June 15, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 688 [**CL-0130**].\n\n820.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the use of the DCF method in this case is reasonable since it concerns an operational plant whose cash flows can be determined and projected. The Claimant is correct in explaining that the framework for establishing cash flows for the But for scenario is not speculative, as it is based on the criteria of the RRO, which guaranteed minimum cash flows.1700 The Tribunal finds that it is possible to construct a hypothetical scenario based on the RRO to objectively and determinately calculate the amount of compensable damage.\n\nReply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 515.\n\n821.\n\nWhile, in principle, the damage calculation based on the DCF method and the comparison between a hypothetical scenario (corresponding to the RRO) and the actual scenario (NRR) is logical and coherent with the circumstances of the case, this does not mean that the Tribunal agrees with the conclusions and scenarios presented in The Brattle Group's damages report. In particular, the Tribunal considers that the damage valuation must take into account and be based on the elements discussed in this decision, namely:\n\n(i) The exclusion of the TVPEE from the set of measures considered for calculating compensable loss;\n\n(ii) The exclusion of the possibility of selling gas-generated electricity at a regulated tariff from the set of measures considered for calculating compensable loss;\n\n(iii) June 20, 2014, as the start date for calculating the loss;\n\n(iv) The 25% reduction, representing the investor's contribution to the loss;\n\n(v) The effects of the 2020 divestment; and\n\n(vi) The useful life of the Arenales Solar plant, which, for the purposes of damage calculation, cannot be 40 years, as suggested in Brattle's But for scenario, but rather 25 years;\n\n(vii) The exclusion of the tax gross-up requested by the Claimant.\n\n822.\n\nSince the damage calculations presented by the Parties to date have not accounted for all the elements outlined in paragraphs 820 and 821 above, the Tribunal requests that the Parties submit a mutually agreed-upon calculation that incorporates the criteria specified therein. If an agreement cannot be reached, the Parties must submit a document outlining the points of agreement and disagreement regarding the amount of compensable loss. Given the complexity of the case, the Tribunal considers a ninety (90)-day period from the notification of this decision to be a reasonable timeframe for this submission. Once this period has elapsed, the Tribunal will proceed to determine the amount of compensation and applicable interest.\n\n**X. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n823.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal rules as follows:\n\n1. Unanimously, it declares that it lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute concerning the alleged violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT through the introduction of the TVPEE.\n\n2. Unanimously, it declares the claim inadmissible regarding the alleged violation of Article 13 of the ECT through the introduction of the TVPEE.\n\n3. Unanimously, it rejects all other Objections to Jurisdiction raised by the Respondent.\n\n4. By majority decision, it declares that the Kingdom of Spain has breached the FET standard set forth in Article 10(1) of the ECT, as detailed in Section VIII(A)(3) of this Decision.\n\n5. Unanimously, it dismisses all other claims by the Claimant regarding the alleged violations of Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT.\n\n6. By majority, to order the Parties (a) to submit to the Tribunal within ninety (90) days from the date of notification of this decision a jointly agreed calculation of the amount of compensation, which must follow the methodology outlined in paragraph 820 of this decision and take into account the criteria indicated in paragraph 821 of the present decision; (b) in case of total or partial disagreement on the final value of the compensation, to submit to the Tribunal within the aforementioned ninety (90) days the points of agreement and disagreement regarding the calculation of compensation.\n\nDate: October 8, 2020"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2022-08-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Decision addresses an application initially submitted on 15 December 2021 and briefed on 19 April 2022 and 30 May 2022 by the Kingdom of Spain (\"**Spain**\" or the \"**Applicant**\"), asking the *ad hoc* Committee to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award rendered on 17 August 2021 in ICSID Case No. ARB/15/4 between STEAG GmbH (\"**STEAG**\") and Spain (the \"**Award**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute in the underlying arbitration related to various legislative and regulatory measures implemented by Spain that modified the regulatory and economic regime applicable to producers of electricity from concentrated solar power (*energ\u00eda termosolar de concentraci\u00f3n* or \"**CSP**\"). STEAG argued that these measures negatively impacted its investment in Arenales Solar PS, S.L., a Spanish company that owned a project for the construction and operation of a solar energy production facility located in Sevilla. The dispute was brought under the Energy Charter Treaty, which entered into force on 16 April 1998 with respect to Germany, and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"**ECT**\"). STEAG alleged that Spain (i) breached its obligations under Article 13 of the ECT by means of the indirect expropriation of their investment; and (ii) failed to comply with the following obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT: (a) fair and equitable treatment, (b) most constant protection and security, and (c) umbrella clause. It sought damages in the amount of at least EUR 79 million by way of compensation for the alleged breaches of the ECT, plus costs. In turn, Spain objected to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the basis of (i) the intra-EU nature of the dispute; (ii) lack of jurisdiction *ratione temporis*; and (iii) Article 21 of the ECT with respect to the claim under Article 10(1) of the ECT: (a)rising out of the Tax on the Value of Production of Electric Power (\"**TVPEE**\").1 Spain also challenged the admissibility of the expropriation claim under Article 13 of the ECT arising out of the introduction of the TVPEE. It also argued that in any event, no breach of the ECT had taken place, and that STEAG had no right to compensation and ought to bear the costs of the proceedings as well as Spain's legal costs.\n\n\"*Impuesto sobre el Valor de la Producci\u00f3n de la Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica*\" (\"***IVPEE***\").\n\n3.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Instructions on the Quantification of Damages of 8 October 2020, the Tribunal decided:\n\n*1) Unanimously to declare that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute regarding the alleged violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT arising out of the introduction of the TVPEE.*\n\n*2) Unanimously to declare inadmissible the claim related to the alleged violation of Article 13 of the ECT arising out of the introduction of the TVPEE.*\n\n*3) Unanimously to reject all other jurisdictional objections of the Respondent.*\n\n*4) By majority to declare that the Kingdom of Spain has violated the fair and equitable treatment standard provided for in Article 10(1) of the ECT, in the terms indicated in Section VIII(A)(3) of this Decision.*\n\n*5) Unanimously to dismiss the Claimant's other claims regarding the alleged violation of Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT.*\n\n*6) By majority to order the Parties (a) to submit to the Tribunal within ninety (90) days from the date of notification of this decision a calculation of the amount of compensation prepared by mutual agreement, which shall follow the methodology indicated in paragraph 820 of this decision and take into account the criteria indicated in paragraph 821 of this decision; (b) in case of total or partial disagreement on the final compensation amount, to submit to the Tribunal within the aforementioned period of ninety (90) days the points of agreement and disagreement in relation to the calculation of the compensation.*2\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Instructions on the Quantification of Damages, 8 October 2020, \u00b6 823 (Committee's translation).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**4\n---------------------------\n\nThis Section describes the steps in the Procedural History that the Committee has deemed relevant for purposes of the present Decision. It is not intended to be an exhaustive narrative of the entire Procedural History up to this point in this annulment proceeding.\n\n6.\n\nOn 15 December 2021, the Applicant filed its Application for Annulment, together with Annexes 1 to 24 (\"**Application for Annulment**\"). In its Application for Annulment, Spain requested, *inter alia*, (i) a provisional stay of enforcement of the Award in accordance with Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2); and (ii) the continuation of the stay of enforcement until the *ad hoc* Committee renders its decision in this annulment proceeding.\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 December 2021, the Acting Secretary General of ICSID registered the Application for Annulment and notified the Parties of the registration, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 50(2)(a) and (b); and informed the Parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n8.\n\nOn 22 March 2022, the *ad hoc* Committee was constituted in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. Its members are: Ms. Eva Kalnina, President, a national of the Republic of Latvia, Mr. Milton Estuardo Argueta Pinto, a national of the Republic of Guatemala, and Mr. Ricardo V\u00e1squez Urra, a national of the Republic of Chile (the \"***ad hoc*** **Committee**\" or \"**Committee**\"). On the same date, the Parties were notified that Mr. Paul Jean Le Cannu, Team Leader | Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 24 March 2022, the Committee, *inter alia*, (i) proposed to hold the First Session by videoconference (Zoom) indicating the dates on which it would be available; and (ii) invited the Parties (a) to confer and jointly propose a schedule of written submissions to address the application for continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, and (b) to consider whether an extension of the 30-day deadline in ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) would be necessary and could be agreed between the Parties.\n\n10.\n\nBy emails of 1 April 2022, the Parties informed the Committee of (i) their availability on the dates proposed for the First Session; and (ii) their respective proposed schedule of submissions on the application for continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award (while both consenting to the extension of the ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) 30-day deadline).\n\n11.\n\nOn 15 April 2022, the Committee through its Secretary informed the Parties of the date of the First Session and the procedural calendar for the written submissions to address the application for continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award. The Committee deferred to a later date the decision as to whether a hearing on the request for continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award would be necessary.\n\n12.\n\nOn 19 April 2022, Spain filed its Submission in Support of the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, together with Annexes 25 to 50 (the \"**Application**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn 10 May 2022, STEAG filed its Response to Spain's Request for the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, together with Exhibits C-0102 to C-0104 and Legal Authorities CL-0164 to CL-0188 (the \"**Response**\").\n\n14.\n\nOn 11 May 2022, the *ad hoc* Committee held the First Session by video conference.\n\n15.\n\nOn 26 May 2022, the *ad hoc* Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the Committee's decisions on the areas in which the Parties were unable to reach an agreement (\"**PO1**\"). PO1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages are English and Spanish, and that the place of the proceeding is Washington, D.C. PO1 also sets out a procedural calendar for the proceeding.\n\n16.\n\nOn 30 May 2022, Spain filed its Reply in Support of the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, together with Annexes 51 to 77 and a draft English translation of STEAG's Financial Statement as of 31 December 2021 (the \"**Reply**\").\n\n17.\n\nOn 20 June 2022, STEAG filed its Rejoinder on the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, together with Legal Authorities CL-189 to CL-195 (the \"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n18.\n\nOn 22 June 2022, the Committee informed the Parties, *inter alia*, that: (i) it had come to the conclusion that no hearing on the application to continue to the stay of enforcement of the Award would be necessary; and (ii) a slight modification of the Procedural Calendar for the annulment proceeding sought by Spain on 21 June 2022 was granted.\n\n19.\n\nOn 19 July 2022, within the agreed time limit, the Committee notified the Parties of its decision on Spain's application for continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, as follows:\n\n*Upon careful review of the Parties' submissions on the Applicant's request for the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the award, the Committee has decided to grant the continuation of the stay provided certain conditions are met by the Applicant. The Committee's fully reasoned decision will be issued in due course.*\n\n20.\n\nThereafter, also on 19 July 2022, the Parties were notified that due to an internal redistribution of the Centre's workload, Mr. Paul Jean Le Cannu would no longer be serving as Secretary of the Committee; and that Ms. Luisa Fernanda Torres, Legal Counsel, ICSID had been designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee from that point forward.\n\n21.\n\nOn 21 July 2022, following a request by Spain, the Committee issued a modified Procedural Calendar for this annulment proceeding (\"**Revision No. 1**\").\n\n22.\n\nThe present instrument incorporates the Committee's previously notified decision of 19 July 2022 on the application for continuation of the stay of enforcement, and it details the reasoning therefor.\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nIn this section, the Committee provides a non-exhaustive summary of each Party's position on the stay of enforcement of the Award, while emphasizing that in reaching its decision, the Committee has carefully considered the entirety of the Parties' submissions on the request for continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n**A.

Applicable Legal Standard***\n----------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nSpain observes that ICSID *ad hoc* committees have wide discretion under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) to continue a stay of enforcement, taking into account the specific circumstances of each case.6 According to Spain, the prevailing practice among committees is to grant the stay, as recognised by the committees in *Occidental v. Ecuador* and *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile*.7 In Spain's view, because the final validity of an award is uncertain when subject to an application for annulment, it would be imprudent to lift the stay and put the parties to the expense of the enforcement process.8\n\nApplication, \u00b6 11; Reply, \u00b6 14.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, *citing* **Annex-25**, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v.

Rather, says Spain, the burden must also be borne by STEAG where it makes a positive assertion, including its assertion that it would suffer prejudice as a result of the stay.13\n\nReply, \u00b6 16, *citing* **Annex-51**, *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v.

Whether the Stay Should be Continued***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nIn Spain's view, all the relevant circumstances weigh in favour of continuing the stay in this case.\n\n29.\n\nFirst, Spain states that its Application for Annulment \"*raises serious, well-grounded bases for annulment and has been made in good faith*.\"14 Spain acknowledges that its intra-EU objection has been rejected by many tribunals, but points out that the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"**CJEU**\") recently confirmed Spain's interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT.15 Further, Spain notes that it has raised other serious grounds for annulment in addition to its intra-EU objection.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 16.\n\nReply, \u00b6 70, *citing* **Annex-20**, Judgment of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union, Case C-741/19, *Republic of Moldova v. Komstroy*, 2 September 2021.\n\n30.\n\nSecond, Spain argues that there is a serious risk that it will be unable to recover any amounts paid to STEAG if the Award is enforced and later annulled. Based on a review of STEAG's 2020 financial statements, Spain alleges that STEAG is in a situation of asset deficiency, with its liabilities exceeding its assets, and that the company's Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (\"**EBIT**\") and cash flow figures reveal that it \"*is consuming high levels of cash in its business, and is covering this negative free cash flow with additional debt*.\"16 Spain also points out that STEAG has entered into a restructuring agreement with its creditors, which STEAG's auditors view as a material uncertainty \"*that may raise significant doubts about the company's ability to continue as a going concern and represents a going concern risk*.\"17 Thus, Spain doubts STEAG would have the funds to repay the Award if it is annulled. Moreover, even if the amounts paid could be recouped, the process of seeking repayment would involve further legal proceedings and significant expense, all of which could be avoided with a continuation of the stay.18\n\nApplication, \u00b6 44. *See* Application, \u00b6\u00b6 31-44 *citing* **Annex-50**, 2020 Financial Statements Steag GmbH, pp. 14-15 and Reply, \u00b6 48.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 49, *quoting* **Annex-50**, 2020 Financial Statements Steag GmbH, p. 2.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 22.\n\n31.\n\nA related concern for Spain is that STEAG has announced that it \"*is in promising negotiations on the sale of the payment claim against the Kingdom of Spain*.\"19 The possible sale of the Award exacerbates the risk of non-recoupment and presents the additional risk that if Spain pays STEAG, it still may be subject to a second claim from a third party.20\n\nApplication, \u00b6 51, *quoting* **Annex-50**, 2020 Financial Statements Steag GmbH, p. 19.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\n32.\n\nThird, Spain argues that the lifting of the stay would create a potential conflict with its obligations under EU law, causing \"*immediate harm for both Parties in case of enforcement*.\"21 Specifically, Spain says that the Award constitutes notifiable State Aid under Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"**TFEU**\"), as already confirmed by the European Commission (\"**EC**\"), and Spain must therefore obtain clearance from the EC to pay the Award.22 According to Spain, this gives rise to the following conflict of its international obligations:\n\n[O]*n the one hand,* [Spain] *must pay the compensation granted by the Steag Tribunal, since the award is binding on the Parties pursuant to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. On the other hand, it cannot make such a payment without the European Commission's authorization, pursuant to Articles 107 and 108 of the* [TFEU].23\n\nReply, \u00b6 167.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 82 and Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 161-165, *citing* **Annex-14**, Decision C(2017) 7384 of the European Commission, regarding the Support for Electricity generation from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste (S.A. 40348 (2015/NN), 10 November 2017.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 94; Reply, \u00b6 147.\n\n33.\n\nSpain notes that if the EC were to determine that the Award constitutes incompatible State Aid after it is enforced, Spain would be required to initiate proceedings against STEAG to recover the amount paid plus interest, resulting in unnecessary burden and expense on both Parties.24\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 86-88.\n\n34.\n\nFourth, Spain asserts that continuing the stay will not cause STEAG any prejudice or harm. Spain sees no risk that it will fail to comply with the Award if it is not annulled, noting that it is has a large economy with ample resources to pay the Award if and when payment becomes appropriate.25 In Spain's view, there is no basis for the allegation that it has a history of refusing to honour awards. Rather, STEAG's reference to the 19 outstanding awards against Spain is inapposite, because it ignores that Spain faces a conflict between international obligations under the ICSID Convention and EU law.26\n\nApplication, \u00b6 65; Reply, \u00b6 64.\n\nReply, \u00b6 60.\n\n35.\n\nSpain offers the following assurance regarding its willingness to pay the Award:\n\n[T]*he Kingdom of Spain, voluntarily, on its own initiative, confirms its commitment to pay the Award if it is not annulled in this proceeding, specifically, by seeking authorization from the European Commission consistent with its obligations under EU law and regulations, and then to pay promptly upon receiving such authorization.*27\n\nReply, \u00b6 62.\n\n36.\n\nTo demonstrate its commitment, Spain points out that it has already requested the notification of the Award to the EC for its State Aid assessment.28\n\nApplication, \u00b6 68.\n\n37.\n\nThus, according to Spain, STEAG has not identified any other harm it would suffer as a result of continuing the stay. To the contrary, if the Award is not annulled, STEAG would be fully compensated for any delay in payment of the Award by the accrual of interest.29\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 69-74, *citing* **Annex-43**, *Caratube International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v.

The provision for interest compensates for the delay*\").\n\n38.\n\nFinally, Spain rejects STEAG's reliance on the cases of the so-called \"Spanish saga,\" arguing that STEAG has offered a \"*partial picture*\" of those cases.30 Among other observations, Spain views the *Eiser* case as \"*probably the best example of the risks of lifting the stay once an application for annulment has been filed*.\"31 There, the committee lifted the stay, forcing Spain to defend enforcement in the United States and Australia, before proceeding to annul the award in full.32\n\nReply, \u00b6 73.\n\nReply, \u00b6 76.\n\nReply, \u00b6 76, *citing* **Annex-67**, Baker & McKenzie, \"*Australian Court Enforces ICSID Awards Against Spain*\", 27 February 2020.\n\n39.\n\nIn view of the above, Spain concludes that \"*as a matter of efficiency, judicial economy, burden on the parties and streamlining of the process of satisfaction of the Award, a stay of enforcement at this time during the annulment proceedings is prudent and fair*.\"33\n\nReply, \u00b6 172.\n\n***3. Security***\n-----------------\n\n40.\n\nSpain urges the Committee to continue the stay without granting any form of security for the Award, which Spain considers unnecessary and inconsistent with both the applicable rules and prevailing practice.34 Spain observes that the ICSID Convention does not expressly recognise a committee's power to order security, and the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention shows that the drafters intentionally omitted the possibility of provisional measures when granting a stay.35 Spain cites several recent cases in which committees have declined to grant security as a condition for the stay.36\n\nReply, \u00b6 175.\n\nReply, \u00b6 177, *citing* **Annex-77**, History of the ICSID Convention: Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (1968), vol.

Spain* and *Tenaris II v. Venezuela*, the provision of a security puts the award creditor in a better position than it would have been in without the annulment proceeding.37 At the same time, Spain says it would bear the costs of the security, effectively \"*penalizing it for requesting annulment and curtailing the right provided by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention*.\"38\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 179, 184 *citing* **Annex-58**, *9REN Holding S.\u00e0.r.l v.

Applicable Legal Standard***\n----------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nLike Spain, STEAG observes that Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention allows a committee to grant a stay of the enforcement of an award \"*if it considers that the circumstances so require*.\"41 However, STEAG disagrees with Spain on two main aspects of the applicable standard under this provision. First, STEAG contends that Spain bears the burden of establishing the circumstances that justify continuation of the stay.42 Second, STEAG does not accept Spain's assertion that it is prudent for a committee to grant a stay simply because the award is subject to an application for annulment. Although STEAG accepts that some committees have treated the stay of enforcement as automatic, it argues that this approach has been abandoned in the more recent cases.43 STEAG's view is that \"*committees should exercise restraint when deciding to grant a stay of enforcement because of its burdensome nature*.\"44\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 22, *quoting* ICSID Convention, Article 52(5).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 24.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 24.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 22; Rejoinder, \u00b6 23.\n\n45.\n\nRegarding the criteria to be considered when assessing whether to continue the stay, STEAG proposes the following broad criteria: (a) whether the application for annulment is frivolous or a dilatory tactic; (b) whether immediate compliance with the award would cause economic hardship on the applicant; and (c) whether it would be very difficult for the applicant to recoup payments made under the award if it is ultimately annulled, because the award creditor is in a very serious financial situation or \"*on the brink of insolvency*.\"45\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 23-27, *quoting* **CL-169**, *Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. & Energia Termosolar B.V.

According to STEAG, this factor becomes relevant only if the Committee is satisfied that the conditions for a stay are met; then it may balance the interest of the Parties to determine whether any conditions are required.49\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 32, *citing* **CL-186**, Brian Kotick and Joel Dahlquist Cullborg, \"A (Counter) Balancing Act: The Express Power to Order a Security on a Stay of Enforcement Pending Annulment,\" [2018] 33(1) *ICSID Review \u2013 Foreign Investment Law Journal*, 272-273.\n\n***2. Whether the Stay Should be Continued***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nSTEAG contends that Spain has failed to establish any of the necessary circumstances to justify granting the stay of enforcement.\n\n49.\n\nFirst, STEAG sees the Application for Annulment as \"*a textbook dilatory tactic*\" aimed at delaying payment of the Award as long as possible.50 Although STEAG does not ask the Committee to review the merits of the Application for Annulment at this stage, it urges the Committee to pay due regard to the fact that \"*Spain has systematically requested the annulment of every single award rendered against it in what has become known as the Spanish saga of renewable energies*,\" and that Spain has consistently requested a stay of enforcement based on the same arguments in every case.51 STEAG states that \"*what Spain is trying to argue by way of the annulment application is mainly a reedition of the arguments related to the so-called intra-EU exception*,\" which has never been accepted by any annulment committee.52\n\nResponse, \u00a7 2.4.1 (heading); Rejoinder, \u00a7 2.3.1 (heading).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 31.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 32.\n\n50.\n\nSecond, STEAG argues that immediate compliance with the Award would cause Spain no economic hardship, noting that the amount of the Award represents just 0.015% of Spain's annual income.53 Regarding Spain's argument that it would be burdened by the cost of additional legal proceedings if it had to seek reimbursement of amounts paid on the Award if annulled, STEAG contends that Spain has not even attempted to explain the expected cost of such proceedings or how those costs would place Spain in a difficult financial position.54\n\nResponse, \u00b6 35; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 35 (stating that \"[e]*very year the Spanish Ministry of Justice assigns a budget to the State Lawyers Corps (Abogac\u00eda del Estado). Such budget, for instance in 2020, was of more than EUR 40,000,000*\").\n\n51.\n\nThird, STEAG rejects Spain's allegation that it would face difficulty recouping any amounts paid on the Award in the case of annulment.55 According to STEAG, Spain has failed to show that STEAG is in a very serious financial situation or about to declare itself insolvent, and Spain's arguments are based on outdated financial statements from 2019 and 2020.56 The reality, says STEAG, is that there has been a positive trend in its key economic figures, resulting from the transformation of its business toward more green energy, as evidenced by its consolidated financial statements for 2021.57 In STEAG's view, these consolidated financial statements are the most accurate picture of its financial situation because \"*STEAG forms a single economic entity with its subsidiaries*.\"58 They show that STEAG would have ample resources to reimburse Spain in the case of annulment. Among other figures, STEAG notes that the amount of the Award is just \"*(i) 0.67% of STEAG's consolidated assets as of 31 December 2021, (ii) 1.09% of STEAG's revenue as of 31 December 2021, (iii) 8.85% of STEAG's cash as of 31 December 2021 and (iv) 9.80% of STEAG's profit in one year only*.\"59\n\nResponse, \u00a7 2.4.3 (heading).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 50.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52, *citing* **C-0104**, STEAG's Consolidated Annual Statements for 2021.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 52.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 53.\n\n52.\n\nIn any event, STEAG states that if Spain is concerned about its ability to recoup funds paid on the Award, STEAG is willing to \"*open an escrow account to deposit any funds collected before the decision on the annulment of the Award*\" \u2013 an approach adopted in prior annulment proceedings.60\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 54; Response, \u00b6 45, *citing* **CL-183**, *Burlington Resources, Inc. v.

Security***\n-----------------\n\n54.\n\nAlternatively, if the Committee is minded to continue the stay, STEAG submits that the Application must be granted on the condition of Spain providing a security to guarantee compliance with the Award.\n\n55.\n\nAs noted above, STEAG considers it appropriate in this context for the Committee to assess the prejudice that STEAG would suffer as a result of the stay. STEAG says the prejudice is significant because \"*Spain's conduct in other arbitrations and its statements so far in these proceedings casts very serious doubts as to Spain's compliance with the Award*.\"61 Again, STEAG notes that Spain has sought annulment of all awards rendered against it so far, and despite the fact that these awards have been upheld in all but one case (*Eiser v. Spain*), Spain has not voluntarily complied with any of them.62 Moreover, Spain has already announced that it will not pay the Award without authorisation by the EC, which STEAG states \"*is not foreseen in the ICSID Convention and is a blatant infringement of Spain's own obligations under Public International law*.\"63\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 59.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 59.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 59.\n\n56.\n\nSTEAG also rejects Spain's assertion that any delay in payment would be compensated by post-award interest. According to STEAG, this view is particularly wrong in the current economic climate of high inflation, with annual inflation in the Euro zone expected to be 8.1% in May 2022. In these circumstances, the interest rate in the Award (quarterly interest rate of 1.5% compounded every quarter) is insufficient to compensate for the loss of value of the Award.64\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 63.\n\n57.\n\nSTEAG asserts that it has the right to enforce the Award immediately and use the funds as it sees fit to offset inflation. However, it says that if a security is granted, \"*then a portion of the lower profitability can be accepted due to the zero risk of collection of the Award amounts*.\"65\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 65.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n---------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAt the outset, the Committee emphasises that the purpose of this Decision is to determine whether the stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued. The Committee takes no decision at this stage on the merits of Spain's Application for Annulment. The Committee also observes that its analysis is necessarily based on its understanding of the record as it presently stands and should not be understood to pre-empt any different conclusions at a later stage.\n\n**A. A****pplicable** **L****egal** **S****tandard**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe stay of enforcement of an award is governed by Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54.\n\n60.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.*\n\n61.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 54 (Stay of Enforcement of the Award) provides that:\n\n*(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application* [\u2026] *request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award* [\u2026]*.*\n\n*(2) If an application* [\u2026] *contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall* [\u2026] *inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the* [\u2026] *Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.*\n\n*(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the* [\u2026] *Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application* [\u2026]*.*\n\n*(4) A request* [\u2026] *shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the* [\u2026] *Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n*(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay.*\n\n62.\n\nConsistent with Articles 31-32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), the Committee interprets these provisions together and in the relevant context, which is provided by Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention concerning the finality of awards:\n\n*The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.*\n\n63.\n\nThe importance of Article 53(1) was recognised by the committee in *Burlington v. Ecuador*, recalling the words of an earlier committee:\n\n[B]*oth parties to the dispute are obliged to abide by an award notwithstanding an annulment proceeding. As stated by the Standard Chartered committee: \"the obligation that each State assumed on ratification of the Convention, under Article 53, to comply with awards against it is particularly important. This obligation is as important as the right to pursue annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. These two articles are linked together.\"*66\n\n**CL-183**, *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 31 August 2017, \u00b6 72 (*quoting* **Annex-70**, *Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd. v. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/20 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay on Enforcement of the Award, 12 April 2017, \u00b6 84). *See also,* **CL-195**, *Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v.

ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement, 12 November 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.\n\n64.\n\nAs of today, there are several decisions within the ICSID system on the matter of stay, and while decisions by prior committees are not binding and do not constitute \"*common law precedents*,\"67 they are invariably referred to by parties and \"*constitute examples of the practice*\" and therefore \"*may influence the Committee if they are convincing and if they concern similar circumstances*.\"68\n\n**Annex-26**, *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 28 December 2007, \u00b6 24.\n\n**Annex-49**, *Patrick Mitchell v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 30 November 2004, \u00b6 23.\n\n65.\n\nHaving said that, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, a committee's decision to continue a stay depends on whether \"*it considers that the circumstances so require*.\" The Convention specifies neither the circumstances that are relevant to the committee's determination nor the relative weight to be given to such circumstances. Rather, as repeatedly observed in prior cases, the determination regarding the stay is left to the discretion of the committee, considering the specific and fact-driven circumstances of each69 case.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, **Annex-30**, *Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement, 21 February 2020, \u00b6 45 (\"*the word 'circumstances'* [*] in Article 52(5)* [...] *is not preceded by any qualifying adjective. The Committee therefore has wide discretion to weigh the circumstances presented by the Applicant*\"), \u00b6 43 (\"[t]*he crux of the matter is therefore whether there are circumstances requiring the stay*\"); **CL-183**, *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 31 August 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 70-71.\n\n66.\n\nThe task of the Committee is to balance, on the one hand, the Applicant's interest in a stay of enforcement of the Award pending the annulment proceeding and, on the other hand, the Respondent on Annulment's right to the finality and enforceability of the Award under the Convention. In other words, as observed by the committee in *Churchill Mining v. Indonesia*, \"[a] *balanced approach between the right of access to justice on the one hand and the right to enforcement on the other must be effectuated by ad hoc committees*.\"70\n\n*Churchill Mining Plc et al. v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/12/14 & 12/40 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Request for Continued Stay, 27 June 2017, \u00b6 38.\n\n67.\n\nThe Committee also agrees with prior committees which have determined that there exists no presumption either in favor of or against granting a continuation of the stay.71 Indeed, no such presumption is reflected in the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules. As convincingly stated by the committee in *Sempra v. Argentina*:\n\n*A stay of enforcement should not in any event be automatic, and there should not even be a presumption in favour of granting a stay of enforcement. This follows, in the Committee's opinion, from the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, which authorizes the Committee to stay enforcement of the award pending its decision \"if it considers that the circumstances so require\". Although the ICSID Convention does not give any indication as to what circumstances would warrant a stay, it is nonetheless clear from this language that there must be some circumstances present that speak in favour of granting a stay. As a consequence, it cannot be assumed that there should be a presumption in favour of a stay or that the primary burden is placed on the award creditor to show that continuation of the stay should not be granted.*72\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, **Annex-30**, *Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement, 21 February 2020, \u00b6 64; **CL-194**, *Sempra Energy International v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 5 March 2009, \u00b6 27.\n\n**CL-194**, *Sempra Energy International v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 5 March 2009, \u00b6 27.\n\n68.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to who bears the burden of proof in relation to the Application. In this regard, the Committee refers to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(4), which provides that a request for a stay of enforcement of an award \"*shall specify the circumstances that require the stay* [\u2026].\" Accordingly, prior committees have concluded, and this Committee agrees, that the burden to establish that the circumstances of the case require continuing the stay rests with the party seeking the stay.73 This position gives due regard to the principle of finality of awards as set forth in Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, **CL-183**, *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 31 August 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 74-75. *See also,* to the same effect, ICSID, Working Paper # 2, Proposals for Amendment of the ICSID Rules, \u00b6 457 (\"*A party requesting stay of enforcement typically has the burden of proof with regard to circumstances that require the stay*\").\n\n69.\n\nFurthermore, the discretion of the Committee under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention includes the authority to attach conditions to a stay of enforcement, if the Committee determines that the stay is required and that imposing conditions on the stay achieves the proper balance of the interests of the Parties in the circumstances. As observed by the committee in *Enron v. Argentina*, this interpretation is \"*consistent with the objects and purposes of Article 52(5), which is designed to enable the ad hoc committee to balance the rights of the parties pending annulment proceedings*.\"74\n\n**CL-185**, *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules), 7 October 2008, \u00b6 26. *See also* **CL-170**, *NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. & NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. v.

Ecuador*, \"*ad hoc committees have the authority to order the granting of securities or written undertakings in connection with the stay of enforcement of an ICSID award. Such authority follows from the inherent powers of ad hoc committees to conduct the proceedings. To date, no committee has considered the opposite.*\"75\n\n**Annex-30**, *Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement, 21 February 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79. *See also*, among others, **CL-195**, *Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v. Georgia*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement, 12 November 2010, \u00b6 29 (\"*It is not the case* [\u2026] *that the powers of an ad hoc committee in this regard are to be exercised restrictively because conditional stays are not expressly mentioned in the ICSID Convention. An ad hoc committee enjoys rather all latitude to find the proper balance between the interests of the parties in a given case and the legitimate right to enforce the award in order to rule on the request for a stay*\").\n\n71.\n\nThe Committee also notes that, according to ICSID's Background Paper on Annulment (dated 5 May 2016), committees attached conditions to the stay of enforcement in 22 out of 36 decisions in which a stay was granted.76\n\n**Annex-6**, ICSID, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, 5 May 2016, \u00b6 58. In a recent working paper concerning proposed amendments to the ICSID Rules, ICSID reported that the proposed rule concerning a stay of enforcement \"*codifies and regulates the practice of conditionally staying enforcement if: (i) a stay is required by the circumstances; and (ii) the condition(s) is necessary in light of the circumstances*.\" The Committee notes in passing that ICSID's more recent Working Papers confirm this view (*see* ICSID, Working Paper # 1, Proposals for Amendment of the ICSID Rules, 2 August 2018, \u00b6 648; and ICSID, Working Paper # 2, Proposals for Amendment of the ICSID Rules, \u00b6 456).\n\n72.\n\nAlthough Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(4) do not specify which \"*circumstances*\" may support a request for the stay of enforcement of an award, parties to prior annulment proceedings have presented, and committees have considered, a number of factors commonly applicable to this inquiry. As observed by ICSID in its Background Paper on Annulment, based on a compilation of decisions, such factors \"*have included the risk of non-recovery of sums due under the award if the award is annulled, non-compliance with the award if the award is not annulled, any history of non-compliance with other awards or failure to pay advances to cover the costs of arbitration proceedings, adverse economic consequences on either party and the balance of both parties' interests*.\"77\n\n**Annex-6**, ICSID, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, 5 May 2016, \u00b6 56 (internal citations omitted); *see also* **Annex-30**, *Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement, 21 February 2020, \u00b6 26 (setting forth a similar list of factors).\n\n73.\n\nAlthough some committees have also considered the additional factor of the merits or prospect for success of the application for annulment,78 the Committee agrees with prior decisions observing that, normally, this factor is not a proper focus for purposes of the decision on whether or not to grant the stay.79 Instead, the Committee accepts the view expressed by both Parties that an appropriate inquiry is whether the application is manifestly dilatory or abusive.80 As STEAG highlights, however, an assessment that the application is not dilatory or abusive is insufficient, by itself, to support the continuation of a stay.81\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, **CL-194**, *Sempra Energy International v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 5 March 2009, \u00b6 24; **Annex-30**, *Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v.

For example, the committee in *Burlington v. Ecuador* terminated the provisional stay of enforcement after finding that its continuation was not required in the circumstances of that case. According to the committee, that was \"*the end of the matter*.\"82 Other annulment committees have reached their respective conclusions \u2013 including whether or not to attach conditions to a stay \u2013 after examining the overall case circumstances, without first making specific findings as to whether a stay was \"*required*.\"83\n\n**CL-183**, *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 31 August 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 85-86. The *Burlington* committee therefore found it \"*unnecessary*\" to address the parties' arguments concerning whether or not Ecuador should have posted security as a condition of the stay. *Id.*\n\n*See generally* **Annex-30**, *Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement, 21 February 2020, \u00a7 IV.A (addressing the varying approaches of committees to this question).\n\n75.\n\nIn this case, the Committee will proceed with a sequential analysis focusing first on whether, given the facts and circumstances specific to the present case, it has been demonstrated that the circumstances \"*require*\" the continuation of the stay; and if so, whether in the exercise of its discretion, the Committee should grant a continuation of the stay. If the Committee decides to continue the stay, then the next step in the Committee's analysis will be to decide whether the stay should be subject to any conditions such as a security.\n\n**B. C****ircumstances in the** **C****ase at** **H****and**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nWithin the framework outlined above, the Committee will now proceed with an assessment of the specific circumstances that the Parties have advanced as relevant for the determination of whether the stay should be continued. Having considered the Parties' positions and in the exercise of its discretion, the Committee finds that the following four issues are the most relevant in determining whether a continued stay is required and, if so, what are the conditions, if any, that are necessary in light of all the circumstances of the present case: (1) the good faith basis of the Application for Annulment and whether it is manifestly dilatory or frivolous; (2) any risk, for Spain, of non-recoupment in case the Award were to be paid and later annulled, with due regard *inter alia* to STEAG's financial viability; (3) any risk, for STEAG, of Spain's non-compliance with the Award if the stay is continued and eventually the Award is not annulled, as well as the relevance of any history of non-compliance with arbitral awards by Spain; and, finally, (4) balance between both Parties' interests in the context of the present Application, including any adverse economic consequences on either Party, which the Committee may take into account in particular when determining whether any conditions should be attached to a stay.\n\n***1. Has the Application for Annulment Been Made in Good Faith?***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Committee begins its analysis with the assessment of whether the Application for Annulment has been made in good faith and is not manifestly frivolous or dilatory. The good faith requirement has been frequently discussed by prior *ad hoc* committees when considering requests for the stay of enforcement.84 As noted in *Masdar v. Spain*, \"*the fact that there is some indication that an annulment application was made without basis in the ICSID Convention or with a dilatory intent is a circumstance that has been considered as a factor weighing in favor of the discontinuance of a stay*.\"85\n\n*See, e.g.,* **Annex-27**, *MTD Equity Sdn Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Respondent's Request for a Continued Stay of Execution, 1 June 2005, \u00b6 28; **Annex-28**, *CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

Komstroy*, 2 September 2021.\n\n80.\n\nAs already noted above, the Committee agrees with STEAG that it does not need to review the merits of the Application for Annulment but rather to merely assess its dilatory or frivolous nature.90 In other words, it is not the Committee's task at the present stage to analyse the seriousness of each and every annulment ground invoked in the Application for Annulment. Suffice it to say that, at the present point in time, the Committee finds that, on a plain reading, Spain's Application for Annulment cannot be considered *prima facie* frivolous.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 25.\n\n81.\n\nIn this context, the Committee also needs to address STEAG's argument that there are two facts proving Spain's continuous dilatory tactics: (1) systematic requests for annulment of every single award rendered against Spain; and (2) consistent requests to stay the enforcement of ICSID awards rendered against it.91 In response, Spain rejects STEAG's allegations and confirms its commitment to honour all arbitral awards, subject to the authorization by the European Commission.92\n\nResponse, \u00b6 31.\n\nReply, \u00b6 62.\n\n82.\n\nThe Committee notes that allegations similar to those made by STEAG have been raised in other cases against Spain. However, they have not been entertained by other committees. For instance, in *Masdar v. Spain*, the committee found that \"*recourse to annulment, including the entitlement to request a stay of enforcement, is a legitimate right provided for in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention*.\"93 In *InfraRed v. Spain*, the committee observed that \"*the fact that in some situations (as occurs with the ECT cases against Spain) the request for annulment is repeatedly made, is of no relevance per se*.\"94\n\n**Annex-51**, *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Kingdom of Spain's Request for a Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 20 May 2020, \u00b6 90.\n\n**CL-174**, *InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited & Others v.

The Committee therefore concludes that there is no evidence on record to conclude that Spain's Application for Annulment would be manifestly frivolous or dilatory, or submitted in bad faith.\n\n84.\n\nThat said, the Committee's present finding that the Application for Annulment cannot be considered manifestly frivolous or dilatory does not mean that the stay should automatically be maintained in the absence of other requirements being met, to which the Committee turns next.\n\n***2. Is There a Risk of Non-Recoupment of Amounts Awarded Under the Award?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe risk of non-recoupment has been considered by a number of *ad hoc* committees when deciding on the stay of enforcement.95 As pointed out by the committee in *SolEs Bajadoz v. Spain*, a risk that Spain would not be able to recoup the monies paid under the Award if annulled is \"*a significant, if not decisive, circumstance within the meaning of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, which militates towards the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award*.\"96\n\n*See* **CL-169**, *Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. & Energia Termosolar B.V.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/20 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Continuation of the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 17 April 2020, \u00b6 132 (concluding that \"*risk of non-recoupment is therefore not a material factor in the Committee's decision whether or not to continue the stay*\").\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 19 *et seq*.; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 24 *et seq*.; Response, \u00b6\u00b6 37 *et seq*.\n\n87.\n\nIn respect of the standard to determine such risk, prior *ad hoc* committees have followed different approaches. In *Masdar v. Spain*, the committee opined that \"*the cases in which a real risk of non-recoupment was found were cases in which 'the risk of bankruptcy was shown to be a legitimate concern*,*'*\" and went on to find that there was no risk of non-recoupment, since there was no evidence showing \"*that Masdar faces the risk of bankruptcy or that it fails regularly to comply with its payment obligations*.\"99 In *InfraRed v. Spain*, the committee acknowledged the risk of non-recoupment after considering the financial statements of the respective party.100 In *RREEF v. Spain*, the committee opined that formal insolvency was not necessary to establish the risk, if the financial accounts of the party showed that it was not on strong financial footing.101\n\n**Annex-51**, *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 28 October 2020, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\n88.\n\nIn the present case, the Committee finds that in determining the risk of non-recoupment it should consider the real risk of insolvency of STEAG, based on its financial statements.\n\n89.\n\nSpain's position on the risk of non-recoupment is based on (1) the allegedly weak financial position of STEAG, and (2) the risk of the sale of the Award.102 To confirm the former, Spain primarily relies upon STEAG's financial statements and restructuring agreement with its creditors. As to the latter, Spain quotes STEAG's own documents and points out that STEAG has neither confirmed nor denied its intention to sell the Award in the present103 case.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 51, *quoting* **Annex-50**, 2020 Financial Statements Steag GmbH, p. 19.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 24 *et seq*.\n\n90.\n\nSTEAG, in turn, maintains that Spain's analysis is manipulative and does not correspond to reality. STEAG asserts that its financial position in 2021 has considerably improved, and the amount of the Award constitutes less than 1% of STEAG's overall assets.104 In respect of the sale of the Award, STEAG confirms that \"*it is the sole legal owner of the Award and will* [\u2026] *continue to be the sole owner of the Award until the end of these proceedings*.\"105\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 49.\n\n91.\n\nThe Committee agrees with STEAG that assessment of financial situation and alleged insolvency cannot be based, in the present case, on the financial statement of one year. What is more, year 2020 is clearly not the most representative for most businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the Committee observes that STEAG's position is also mostly based on the financial statement for one year, this being the most recent financial year 2021. The Committee therefore concludes that the Parties' arguments in the present respect and the evidence presently on record is of limited assistance in order for the Committee to determine the alleged insolvency risk of STEAG.\n\n92.\n\nMoreover, the Committee observes that STEAG's corporate structure is indeed quite complex, and that therefore it may be more reasonable to consider the consolidated financial statements of STEAG and its related companies. On the one hand, such corporate structures make companies more secure by allowing them *inter alia* to distribute assets between their subsidiaries. On the other hand, a complex corporate structure may also leave room for a potential dissipation of assets and/or difficulties in determining the scope of each entity's responsibility. Thus, in the Committee's view, the analysis of STEAG's corporate structure is again of limited assistance in assessing the potential risk of non-recoupment in the present case.\n\n93.\n\nAs to the alleged sale of the Award mentioned by STEAG in its financial statement of 2020, the Committee notes that in its Rejoinder, STEAG confirmed its intention to remain the sole owner of the Award until the end of these proceedings. At the present stage, the Committee finds no grounds to question STEAG's representation, let alone assume any bad faith on STEAG's behalf.\n\n94.\n\nTo conclude, the Committee acknowledges, in principle, the relevance of the risk of non-recoupment as a factor that needs to be considered when deciding on the stay of enforcement. The Committee further acknowledges that, in the present circumstances and based on the evidence before it, it cannot exclude that a certain risk of non-recoupment might exist, even if it may not be large. The Committee is also mindful of the potential inconvenience for Spain if it were required to pursue a potentially complex process, navigating through STEAG's corporate structure, in order to recover amounts paid under the Award, if it were eventually annulled.\n\n95.\n\nThat said, as the risk of non-recoupment is but one of several important factors for determining whether the stay of enforcement should be continued, the Committee does not need to attempt to determine the exact extent of this risk and will instead take its above findings into account in the context of other circumstances.\n\n***3. Is There a Risk of Non-Compliance With the Award?***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Committee will now address STEAG's concern regarding the risk of Spain's non-payment of the Award, if the Application for Annulment is rejected. Should the Committee find that such a risk exists, the Committee will evaluate the need to order security for the continuation of the stay of enforcement, as requested by STEAG.\n\n97.\n\nIt is undisputed that the risk of non-payment or non-compliance with the Award is an important criterion to be considered by the Committee, although it is not determinative.106 For example, in *Enron v. Argentina,* as well as in *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina*, the *ad hoc* committees granted the stay despite acknowledging a high risk of non-compliance with a party's obligations under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.107\n\n*See* Reply, \u00b6 58.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 64, *citing* **Annex-40**, *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 7 October 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 29, 46; **Annex-42,** *Continental Casualty Company v.

The awards \"*that have not been annulled and that remain outstanding are pending EC\u00b4s approbation, w*[h]*ich is a precondition to its payment*,\" Spain explains.111\n\nReply, \u00b6 186.\n\n101.\n\nSpain further provides a detailed history of decisions on stay of enforcement in the so-called \"*Spanish saga,*\" wherein, *inter alia,* the risk of non-compliance with awards was addressed by the committees.112 Spain reminds that, being the fifth economy of the European Union, it has sufficient financial resources to pay the awards, if ordered to do so.113 Spain therefore reiterates its commitment \"*to pay the Award if it is not annulled in this proceeding*\" upon receiving authorisation from the European Commission.114\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 73 *et seq*.\n\nReply, \u00b6 64.\n\nReply, \u00b6 62.\n\n102.\n\nThe Committee does not find it helpful or pertinent to analyse the circumstances of all the cases against Spain pending in annulment. In determining any risks of non-compliance, due regard should however be had to the awards upheld in annulment proceedings, such as:\n\n\u2022 *PV Investors v. Kingdom of Spain*, PCA Case No. 2012-14;\n\n\u2022 *Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. & Energia Termosolar B.V.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31;\n\n\u2022 *NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. & NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/11;\n\n\u2022 *SolEs Badajoz GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/38;\n\n\u2022 *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV & Others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/20.115\n\nResponse, \u00b6 11.\n\n103.\n\nThe Committee notes that neither Party has presented any factual exhibits regarding alleged non-compliance of Spain with payment obligations under the abovementioned awards. To the best of the Committee's understanding, Spain's position is that, in principle, its obligations to comply with these awards are in conflict with Spain's obligations under EU law: \"[s]*hould the stay be lifted, a potential conflict of international obligations could arise*.\"116 In particular, Spain's position appears to be that it requires a certain authorisation from the European Commission in order to proceed with the payments.117\n\nReply, \u00b6 117.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 116-118.\n\n104.\n\nPurely on the evidence before it, the Committee cannot conclude whether Spain has the history of non-compliance with the awards. Nevertheless, the Committee is mindful of Spain's assertion that its payment obligations appear to be conditional upon the decision of the European Commission on the compatibility of the Award with European Union law.\n\n105.\n\nIndeed, the Committee is mindful of the Applicant's arguments about the international conflict faced by the Kingdom of Spain, which fundamentally goes to the merits of the present dispute, but is also relevant for the purposes of the stay.118 In the latter context, the Committee agrees with the *ad hoc* committee in *Antin v. Spain*, stating that Spain \"*willingly chose to undertake international obligations that may conflict with each other, it cannot thereafter complain of prejudice once these conflicts arise.*\"119 The Committee concludes that, despite Spain's good faith to fulfil its commitments, which the Committee has no reason to question, the existing allegation of conflict creates uncertainty as to real prospects of Spain's payment of the Award. In other words, the Committee finds that STEAG has raised some valid grounds for concern about a potential risk of non-payment of the Award.\n\nReply, \u00b6 146.\n\n**CL-169**, *Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. and Energia Termosolar B.V.

Spain* permitted the stay subject to Spain's undertaking to \"*unconditionally and promptly pay the amount owed under the Award*.\"122\n\n*See, e.g.,* **Annex-26**, *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 28 December 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 25, 37 and 40; **Annex-57**, *Soles Badajoz GMBH v.

Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/11 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 6 April 2020, \u00b6 95.\n\n108.\n\nIn the case at hand, STEAG suggests that the provision of a security should be considered as a useful tool to establish some balance between the Parties.123 Spain, in turn, finds it unnecessary and questions the Committee's powers to condition the stay of enforcement.124 More specifically, Spain refers to the drafting history of the ICSID Convention to demonstrate that negotiators intentionally deleted the provisions granting the powers to condition the stay.125\n\nResponse, \u00b6 49.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 175-176.\n\nReply, \u00b6 177.\n\n109.\n\nSpain further relies upon recent developments in *SolEs Badajoz v. Spain, Watkins v. Spain, Azurix v. Argentina, Tenaris II v. Venezuela, RREEF v. Spain* and *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile* to prove that security is an exceptional tool granted in exceptional circumstances.126 It also quotes the *ad hoc* committee in *9REN v. Spain*, which rejected granting of the security as a tool that would put the applicant in a better position than it would have been without annulment proceedings ever being initiated.127\n\nReply, \u00b6 178.\n\nReply, \u00b6 179.\n\n110.\n\nAs a final point, Spain argues that ordering a security \"*would equal imposing a cost or a fine to the Kingdom of Spain, which are not foreseen in the ICSID Convention, and in fact penalizing it for requesting annulment and curtailing the right provided by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention*.\"128\n\nReply, \u00b6 182.\n\n111.\n\nThe Committee will first address Spain's concerns regarding the Committee's powers to grant security. In fact, the source of the Committee's powers is found in Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:\n\n*(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.*\n\n112.\n\nIn view of the wording of the above provision, the Committee cannot agree with Spain's interpretation of Article 52(5). While the express provision granting the Committee powers to make the stay conditional was not included in the final text of this provision, such powers are not expressly prohibited either. In the Committee's view, the negotiators left it to each individual committees' discretion to determine the scope of their jurisdiction.\n\n113.\n\nSimilar view was expressed, for example, by the *ad hoc* committee in *Enron v. Argentina*:\n\n*The Committee does not view that silence as necessarily meaning that the power does not exist. The Committee considers that a discretionary power to allow or deny a remedy may implicitly include a power to allow the remedy subject to conditions, and that such an interpretation would be consistent with the objects and purposes of Article 52(5), which is designed to enable the ad hoc committee to balance the rights of the parties pending annulment proceedings.*129\n\n**CL-185**, *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v.

The Committee will therefore analyse next whether such circumstances exist in the case at hand.\n\n115.\n\nThe Committee's view on this point resonates with the findings expressed by prior committees in *SolEs Badajoz v. Spain*130 and *Azurix v. Argentina.*131 In the former case, the committee held:\n\n*In deciding whether to order a condition for the stay, the Committee is guided by the observation made by the ad hoc committee in Azurix v. Argentina, that the provision of a security is not \"an automatic or counterbalancing right\" to a stay, but should instead be ordered only in \"limited exceptions* [\u2026] *in order to eliminate any 'reasonable doubt as to the State's intent to comply'\".*132\n\n**Annex-57**, *Soles Badajoz GMBH v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/38 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 26 August 2020.\n\n**Annex-26**, *Azurix Corp. v.

That said, in the Committee's view, the existing allegations of conflict between Spain's obligations under EU law and the ICSID Convention amounts to such exceptional circumstances where the security may be justified to counter the effects of such alleged conflict.\n\n117.\n\nIn other words, while the Committee finds no reason to doubt Spain's financial stability and its good faith commitment to satisfy the Award, the Committee is also of the view that Spain may ultimately assert that the existence of such conflicting obligations prevents it from complying with the Award in case its Application for Annulment is rejected.\n\n118.\n\nThe Committee further turns to Spain's argument that, upon provision of security, STEAG is going to be put in a better position than it would have been if annulment proceedings had not been brought.133 The Committee respectfully disagrees with the findings of the *9REN v. Spain* committee on this matter,134 since in its view compliance with the Award under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention is itself an obligation undertaken by Spain. In the words of the *Masdar v. Spain* committee, Spain's commitment to comply with the Award, if not annulled, \"*does not put Masdar in any better a position than it would have been if the Award were immediately enforced*.\"135\n\nReply, \u00b6 184.\n\n**Annex-58**, *9REN Holding S.\u00e0.r.l v.

Argentina, \"the provision of a bank guarantee puts a claimant in a better position than it would be if annulment had not been sought, since it converts the undertaking of compliance under Article 53 of the Convention into a financial guarantee and avoids any issue of sovereign immunity from execution*.\")\n\n**Annex-51**, *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v.

The Committee notes that, by Spain's own assertions, its compliance with the Award is dependent not only on Spain's own intention but on the findings of the European Commission.136 The Committee cannot accept Spain's position that it must fulfil other obligations under different treaties as a valid reason for granting a continuation of an unconditional stay. Without prejudice to the outcome of this Annulment Application, the Committee makes the general observation that an ICSID award is binding on the parties and compliance with it cannot be subjected to other obligations, either domestic or international.\n\nIn its Reply, Spain \"*confirms its commitment to pay the Award if it is not annulled in this proceeding, specifically, by seeking authorization from the European Commission consistent with its obligations under EU law and regulations, and then to pay promptly* ***upon receiving such authorization***.\" Reply, \u00b6 62 (emphasis added); *see also*, *id.* \u00b6 169.\n\n120.\n\nThus, in view of all the circumstances of the case and in order to address Spain's concerns regarding the risk of non-recoupment whilst at the same time being mindful of STEAG's arguments regarding the potential risk of non-compliance with the Award by Spain, if the Award is not annulled, the Committee finds that imposition of security in the form of a bank guarantee equal to 50 % of the compensation granted in the Award and namely **EUR 13,837,500** in total, drawn on a reputable Western bank which is neither Spanish nor controlled by Spanish interests, is appropriate as a condition of the stay of enforcement. In the Committee's view, such security appropriately mitigates against any potential risks and adequately balances any potential harm or prejudice caused to either Party, as discussed further below.\n\n***4. What is the Balance of Hardships Between the Parties?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nAs follows from the above, the Committee's task while deciding on the stay of enforcement includes balancing of the hardships of the Parties.137 The Parties have discussed at length any prejudice or harm caused to each Party if the Committee grants or refuses to grant the continuation of the stay.138 In essence, the Parties' arguments raise the following questions: (a) whether the risk of non-recoupment causes harm to the Kingdom of Spain; (b) whether the risk of non-compliance with the Award causes harm to STEAG; (c) whether delay in payment may be compensated to STEAG by the accrual of interest on the Award.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 66.\n\n*See* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 24 *et seq.*; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 45 *et seq.*\n\n122.\n\nThe Committee has already addressed in detail the risks of non-recoupment and non-compliance above, and has come to the conclusion that the granting of security sufficiently balances these risks and strikes an appropriate balance between the Parties' different interests, including any potential prejudice or harm caused to either Party by the Committee's decision on stay.\n\n123.\n\nThat said, the Committee still needs to consider the issue of the accrual of interest on the Award, which is a factor put forward by the Parties in this case and which has also been considered by prior committees. For instance, in *El Paso v. Argentina*, the *ad hoc* committee found that \"*the creditor has the right, if the application for annulment were rejected, to collect the interest accrued until the date when payment of the amount indicated in the Award is made*.\"139 Similarly, in *Azurix v. Argentina* case the *ad hoc* committee held that \"[t]*he provision for interest compensates for the delay.*\"140\n\n**Annex-54**, *El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 14 November 2012, \u00b6 53.\n\n**Annex-26**, *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 28 December 2007, \u00b6 40.\n\n124.\n\nThis issue of post-award interest was also considered by several committees in cases against Spain. In *Watkins v. Spain* and *9REN v. Spain*, the *ad hoc* committees found that the payment of interest would adequately compensate for the delay in the enforcement of the awards*.*141 At the same time, the *Masdar v. Spain* and *SolEs Badajoz v. Spain ad hoc* committees held that the payment of interest itself is not a circumstance justifying the stay. Indeed, it might be considered to establish prejudice for the creditor, but the *ad hoc* committees in these respective cases did not find it significant.142\n\n**Annex-56**, *Watkins Holdings S.\u00c0.R.L and Others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/44 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 28 June 2021, \u00b6 49; **Annex-58**, *9REN Holding S.\u00e0.r.l v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/15 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on The Stay of Enforcement of The Award, 19 November 2021, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142.\n\n**Annex-51,** *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Kingdom of Spain's Request for a Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 20 May 2020, \u00b6 98; **Annex-57**, *Soles Badajoz GMBH v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/38 \u2013 Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, 26 August 2020, \u00b6 81.\n\n125.\n\nIn the present case, the Committee must determine whether post-award interest may compensate any alleged prejudice caused to STEAG as a result of the delay in payment. While Spain maintains that the accrued interest constitutes more than adequate compensation for the delay,143 STEAG argues that current macroeconomic circumstances do not compensate the loss of the Award's value as a result of the Eurozone inflation.144\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 53-54.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 64.\n\n126.\n\nThe Committee agrees that the 2022 annual inflation rate in the Eurozone is hardly predictable considering the current economic and geopolitical circumstances. Nonetheless, the Committee is inclined to agree with the *ad hoc* committee's view in *MTD v. Chile*, finding that delay in payment is \"*incidental to the Convention system of annulment*\" and may be remedied by the payment of interest.145 The Committee thus finds that, in view of its decision to order Spain to provide security, STEAG's risk regarding Spain's potential non-compliance with the Award is sufficiently lowered, and the payment of interest can reasonably compensate any delay in payment.\n\n**Annex-27,** *MTD Equity Sdn Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Decision on the Respondent's Request for a Continued Stay of Execution, 1 June 2005, \u00b6 36.\n\n127.\n\nBased on the above, the Committee concludes that the prejudice or harm allegedly caused to each Party is reasonably balanced by its decision to order Spain to provide security in the amount of 50% of the compensation granted in the underlying Award.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n128.\n\nBased on the above considerations, the Committee decides that:\n\n(i) The provisional stay of enforcement of the Award shall continue for the duration of these annulment proceedings, provided that within sixty (60) days of this Decision the Applicant presents to STEAG and the Committee an unconditional and irrevocable letter of guarantee issued by an internationally recognized bank which is neither Spanish nor controlled by Spanish interests for the amount of 50% of the principal amount of compensation granted in the Award at paragraph 117(6) and namely **EUR 13,837,500** which may be drawn upon in full by STEAG upon presentation of a Decision of the Committee rejecting the Application for Annulment.\n\n(ii) If the Applicant does not comply with the above condition, the Committee may order the termination of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n(iii) The costs arising out of this Application for the continuation of stay are reserved for a subsequent stage of the proceedings."}]}
