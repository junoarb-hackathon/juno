PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn May 23, 2002, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter \"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received from Siemens A.G. (hereinafter \"Siemens\" or \"the Claimant\") a request for arbitration against the Argentine Republic (hereinafter \"the Respondent\" or \"Argentina\"). On June 7, 2002, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the request in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (hereinafter the \"Institution Rules\") and informed the Claimant that it would not take further action until it has received the prescribed lodging fee as provided by Institution Rule 5(l)(b). On June 13, 2002, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the prescribed lodging fee by the Claimant and transmitted a copy of the request to Argentina and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C. in accordance with Institution Rule 5(2).\n\n2.\n\nAccording to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"the ICSID Convention\"), the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the request for arbitration on July 17, 2002. In accordance with Institution Rule 7, the Secretary-General notified the parties on the same date of the registration of the request and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n3.\n\nOn August 7, 2002, the parties agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator to be appointed by each party and the third, who shall serve as the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties. The Claimant appointed Judge Charles N. Brower, a U.S. national, and the Respondent appointed Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro, a Spanish national. However, the parties failed to agree on the appointment of the third, presiding arbitrator. On October 21, 2002, the Claimant requested that the third, presiding arbitrator be appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (hereinafter \"the Arbitration Rules\").\n\n4.\n\nAfter consulting the parties, Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, a national of Spain, was appointed by the Centre as the third, presiding arbitrator. In accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, on December 19, 2002, the Secretary-General notified the parties that all three arbitrators accepted their appointment and that the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed to be constituted and the proceedings deemed to began on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal. The Tribunal held its first session in Washington, D.C. on February 13, 2003.\n\n5.\n\nMr. Guido Santiago Tawil of M. & M. Bomchil and Dr. Peter Gnam of Siemens, A.G. represent the Claimant. Messrs. Tawil and Gnam represented the Claimant at the first session. Dr. Horacio Daniel Rosatti, Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, represents the Respondent. Messrs. Ignacio Su\u00e1rez Anzorena and Carlos Lo Turco, acting on instructions from the Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, and Mr. Osvaldo Siseles, from the Ministerio de Econom\u00eda de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina, represented the Respondent at the first session.\n\n6.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections to any members of the Tribunal. It was also noted that the proceedings would be conducted under the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force since September 26, 1984.\n\n7.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties also agreed on several other procedural matters, which were later reproduced in the written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. Regarding the written submissions, the Tribunal, after consulting with the parties in this respect, fixed the following time limits for the presentation of the parties\u2019 pleadings: The Claimant would file a memorial within 90 (ninety) days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would file a counter-memorial within 90 (ninety) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s memorial; the Claimant would file a reply within 60 (sixty) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial, and the Respondent would file a rejoinder within 60 (sixty) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s reply.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal further noted that, according to the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Respondent has the right to raise any objections to jurisdiction no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of its counter-memorial, but that in the event that the Respondent raises objections to jurisdiction, the following schedule would apply: The Claimant would file a counter-memorial on jurisdiction within the same number of days used by Argentina to file its objections to jurisdiction, but in any event, the Claimant would have a minimum of 60 (sixty) days to file its counter-memorial on jurisdiction; the Respondent would file a reply on jurisdiction within 30 (thirty) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s counter-memorial on jurisdiction; the Claimant would file a rejoinder on jurisdiction within 30 (thirty) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s reply on jurisdiction. It was also agreed that, if the Respondent would raise any objections to jurisdiction and proceedings would be resumed following the filing of such objections (because the Tribunal dismisses the objections or because it decides to join them to the merits of the dispute), the calendar agreed for the merits would recommence, and the Respondent would have the remaining number of days at the date of the filing of its objections to jurisdiction, for the filing of its counter-memorial on the merits.\n\n9.\n\nOn March 13, 2003, the Claimant filed its memorial on the merits and accompanying documentation.\n\n10.\n\nOn March 24, 2003, Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, ICSID, Counsel, assumed her position as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nOn April 8, 2003, the parties agreed that the hearing on jurisdiction would take place on January 20-22, 2004, in Washington, D.C.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of June 10, 2003, the Argentine Republic requested an extension of time due to the institutional succession in the Argentine Government to file its counter-memorial on the merits and/or to raise any objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre until August 4, 2003. By letter of June 18, 2003, the Claimant objected to the extension requested by the Respondent.\n\n13.\n\nOn June 23, 2003, due to the particular circumstances, the Tribunal granted the extension sought by Argentina and informed the parties that if the Argentine Republic filed its counter-memorial without objecting to jurisdiction, the Claimant, if requested, would be granted a similar extension of time to file its reply on the merits. The Tribunal further noted that if the Argentine Republic filed any objections to jurisdiction, the Claimant would have the same number of days used by the Argentine Republic to file such objections for the filing of its counter-memori al on jurisdiction.\n\n14.\n\nOn July 1, 2003, Dr. Horacio Daniel Rosatti informed the Tribunal that he had been appointed Procurador del Tesoro de la Nacion Argentina.\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), on August 4, 2003, the Respondent filed a memorial raising objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. In its memorial on jurisdiction, Argentina requested the Tribunal for a 45 (forty-five) day extension of the time limit to file its counter-memorial on the merits in the event that the Tribunal would declare that it has competence over this matter.\n\n16.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3), on August 7, 2003, the Tribunal suspended the proceedings on the merits.\n\n17.\n\nOn August 8, 2003, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide its observations regarding the Respondent\u2019s request concerning the extension of the time limit to file its countermemorial on the merits. The Claimant presented its observations on August 11, 2003. On August 21, 2003, the Tribunal informed the parties that they considered it premature to decide this issue at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n18.\n\nOn October 16, 2003, the Claimant filed its counter-memorial on jurisdiction. Thereafter, on November 17, 2003, the Respondent filed its reply on jurisdiction.\n\n19.\n\nOn December 10, 2004, the Respondent requested to postpone the hearing on jurisdiction scheduled for January 20-22, 2004, until February 15, 2004. On December 11, 2004, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to present any observations to the Respondent\u2019s request. On the same date, the Claimant presented its observations, asking the Tribunal to reject the Respondent\u2019s request and to maintain the previous agreed schedule for the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of December 19, 2003, the Tribunal informed the parties of its decision to schedule the hearing on jurisdiction on February 3 and 4, 2004.\n\n21.\n\nOn December 24, 2003, the Claimant filed its rejoinder on jurisdiction.\n\n22.\n\nAs previously decided by the Tribunal, the hearing on jurisdiction took place in Washington, D.C. on February 3 and 4, 2004. At the hearing, the Claimant was represented by Mr. Guido Santiago Tawil, Dr. Peter Gnam and Mr. Stephan Signer and Ms. Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Corr\u00e1. Mr. Tawil and Dr. Gnam addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant. The Respondent was represented by Ms. Andrea Gualde, Ms. Ana Badillos, and Mr. Jorge Barraguirre from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, as well as by Messrs. Osvaldo Siseles, from the Ministerio de Econom\u00eda de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina, and Roberto Hermida, from the Embassy of Argentina in Washington, D.C. Ms. Gualde and Mr. Barraguirre addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Respondent. During the hearing, the Tribunal also put questions to the parties in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(3).\n\n**II. THE FACTS**\n-----------------\n\n23.\n\nIn August 1996, the Respondent invited bids for a contract to establish a system of migration control and personal identification (\"the System\"). The bidding terms required that a local company be established by bidders in order to participate in the bidding process. The Claimant established, through its wholly-owned affiliate Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG (\"SNI\"), a local corporation, Siemens IT Services S.A. (\"SITS\").\n\n24.\n\nAs required by the bidding terms, SITS took part as a bidder and its offer showed evidence - as requested by the Respondent - that SNI was wholly integrated into Siemens, the sole owner of its shares, that SNI was managed by Siemens and \"by virtue of law is jointly liable for the obligations that SNI assumes before third parties.\"1\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 13\n\n25.\n\nSITS\u2019 bid won the contract, which was signed on October 6, 1998 and approved by Decree No. 1342/98 (\"the Contract\"). The Contract had a term of six years with the possibility of two extensions of three years each. Siemens proceeded to make the required investments through capital contributions to SITS and funds provided to SITS to enable it to carry out its obligations under the Contract.\n\n26.\n\nOn December 10, 1999, a new Government came to power in Argentina and in February 2000 it suspended the contract allegedly because of technical problems. In March 2000, a commission was established to review the Contract. SITS agreed to a proposal *(propuesta de reformulacion contractual)* made by this commission in November 2000 within the scope of Emergency Law 25,344. A new and different proposal was received by SITS on May 3, 2001. On May 18, 2001, the Respondent terminated the Contract by Decree No. 669, issued under Emergency Law 25,344. SITS filed three administrative appeals against Decree No. 669 on June 5, June 19, and July 5, 2001. The appeals were rejected by Decree No. 1205/01, dated September 24, 2001.\n\n27.\n\nOn July 23, 2001, Siemens had notified the Respondent of a breach of the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Argentine Republic concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments, signed on April 9, 1991 (\"the Treaty\"), triggering a six-month negotiation period under the Treaty. Representatives of the parties met on several occasions but could not resolve the dispute. On March 18, 2002, Siemens confirmed its agreement to ICSID arbitration under Article 10 of the Treaty.\n\n**III. OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe Respondent filed eight objections to jurisdiction:\n\n(1) Siemens has breached factual and temporal requirements of the Treaty.\n\n(2) The dispute was submitted to the local jurisdiction.\n\n(3) Siemens lacks *ius standi',* the Treaty requires a direct relationship between the company of the other Contracting Party and the investment.\n\n(4) Siemens lacks *ius standi',* the Treaty allows indirect claims only in the context of\n\nArticle 4.\n\n(5) The dispute does not arise directly out of an investment.\n\n(6) The dispute is hypothetical.\n\n(7) Siemens has included new claims which had not been notified to the Respondent under the terms of the Treaty.\n\n(8) The Contract includes a specific and exclusive jurisdictional clause.\n\n28.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent made \"Some Preliminary Considerations\" regarding the concept of \"Investment and Investor\", \"Breaches of the Treaty\", \"Development of the Investment Dispute\", \"Some Preliminary Aspects of the Context and Legal Basis of Siemens\u2019 Claims\" and \"Applicable Law\". The Tribunal will consider first applicable law, and to the extent that other preliminary considerations have a bearing on the jurisdiction of the Centre or the competence of the Tribunal, they will be considered as part of the objections to jurisdiction. The Tribunal will consider the objections to jurisdiction in the sequence presented in the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n**1. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n***(a) Position of the Respondent***\n------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the Treaty clause on applicable law which provides that the dispute shall be decided \"on the basis of the present treaty, and if applicable, on the basis of other treaties in force between the Parties, the local law of the Contracting Party in which territory the investment was made, including its rules on conflict of laws and on the general principles of international law.\"2 Based on this provision, the Respondent argues that \"the dispute is governed mainly by Argentine law, which in turn is the law applicable to contractual issues and those issues concerning the status of investor in an Argentine corporation underlying Siemens\u2019 claim.\"3\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 93.\n\nIbid. para. 94.\n\n***(b) Position of the Claimant***\n----------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant argues that \"It is a well established principle that jurisdictional questions should be decided on the basis of the Treaty and international law only. Decisions on jurisdiction are governed solely by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the pertinent provisions of the Treaty, as *lex specialist\"4.* None of these provisions is affected by any provision of Argentine law to the contrary. Furthermore, the Treaty is an international law instrument and international law applies alongside the Treaty.5 The Claimant also notes that the law applicable to the dispute is a matter to be considered in the merits phase of the proceedings.6\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 40.\n\nIbid. para. 48.\n\nIbid. para. 44.\n\n***(c) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nArgentina in its allegations has not distinguished between the law applicable to the merits of the dispute and the law applicable to determine the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. This being an ICSID Tribunal, its jurisdiction is governed by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the terms of the instrument expressing the parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration, namely, Article 10 of the Treaty. Therefore, the Tribunal needs to assess whether the Request for Arbitration meets the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and of Article 10 of the Treaty.\n\n**2. First Objection: Siemens Has Breached Factual and Temporal Requirements of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Position of the Respondent***\n------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimant has invoked the most-favored-nation (\"MFN\") clause of the Treaty to avoid, as is permitted under the Treaty between Argentina and Chile concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments of October 2, 1991 (\"the Chile BIT\"), a prior submission of the dispute to the local courts. Alternatively, Siemens submits that the 18-month period provided by the Treaty to allow a decision of the local courts to the satisfaction of the parties is a mere rule of procedure and not an obstacle to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and that it would be futile to pursue this dispute in the local courts because it is impossible to obtain a decision of the courts within the 18-month period.\n\n33.\n\nArgentina considers that the scope of the MFN clause can be determined only through interpretation of the specific treaty in which it appears: \"[I]t cannot be said that there is only one way to interpret the extent of the MFN clause, as this could change according to the provisions in which it is included.\"7 In support of this argument, the Respondent refers to *Rights* *of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco, Anglo-Iranian Oil, AAPL,* and *Maffezini* and concludes that it is not possible \"to determine *a priori* whether a certain clause of an international treaty is subject or not to the application of the MFNC of another convention of equal nature. That shall depend on what the Parties had agreed upon in each case.\"8\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 112.\n\nIbid, paras. 114-118.\n\n34.\n\nArgentina argues that the Claimant has based its case in particular on *Maffezini,* ignoring that the MFN clause included in the Treaty between Argentina and Spain concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments of October 3, 1991 (\"the Spain BIT\") is \"substantially different from that included in the Treaty and must be object of a specific analysis of this Tribunal.\"9 Argentina affirms that MFN clauses \"constitute a sort of legal anomaly\"10 since they create a framework that \"extraordinarily conditions a basic principle of international law regarding bilateral obligations: the principle of *res inter alios acta\"*11 Then Argentina refers to the application of the principle of *ejusdem generis* and quotes from the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission (\"ILC\") on the MFN Clauses: \"The beneficiary State acquires the rights...only in respect of persons or things which are specified in the clause or implied from its subject-matter.\"12\n\nIbid. para. 119.\n\nIbid. para. 120.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid. para. 121, Article 2(2).\n\n35.\n\nArgentina argues that the MFN clause in the Treaty precludes an investor from invoking the Chile BIT. This argument is based on a textual and contextual interpretation \"including arguments relative to the international law applicable to the relationship between the parties at the moment when the Treaty was celebrated, and to the general and particular practice regarding investment treaties.\"13\n\nIbid. para. 125.\n\n36.\n\nIt is the contention of Argentina that the text of Article 3(1) of the Treaty refers only to investments and the treatment of investments. It does not cover treatment to be accorded to holders of investments. The lack of the \"subjective\" element is in contrast to the text of Article 10 of the Treaty that refers to the possibility for the parties (State/investor) to submit their differences to the competent courts and arbitration. There is no basis in Article 3(1) to construe the term investments in such manner as to include \"the modalities established for a dispute settlement system\". In any case, a dispute settlement procedure cannot be deemed an asset -an investment- in plain English.14\n\nIbid, paras. 129-132.\n\n37.\n\nArgentina equally maintains that the text of Article 3(2) of the Treaty does not allow one to infer that the parties thereto intended to include the dispute settlement system within the scope of the application of the MFN clause because it is not an activity in connection with an investment. This is confirmed by the definition of \"activities\" in Ad Article 3 of the Protocol. This definition relates to transactions of a commercial and economic nature in relation to exploitation and management of investments. There is no expression in the definition that would allow the reader tacitly to include dispute settlement in the definition used. According to Argentina, \"the *ratio legis* of the Protocol is precisely that of limiting that concept to the management of assets in a commercial sense.\"15\n\nIbid. para. 137.\n\n38.\n\nArgentina considers that the plain meaning of the word \"activities\" within the context of an investment treaty does not support an interpretation compatible with the Claimant\u2019s position. The Respondent considers that, in this context, \" *Activity* refers to the group of actions related to operation and management, and could be understood to mean enterprise, as expressed by modem commercial scholars.\"16 This meaning is confirmed by the definition of \"company\" in Article 1(4) of the Treaty: \"any juridical person [...] irrespective of whether or not its activities are directed at profit.\"\n\nIbid. para. 140.\n\n39.\n\nArgentina further supports its position by analyzing provisions of the laws of Italy, Germany and Argentina and concludes that \"both [S]tates Parties to this Treaty give to the term activity an equivalent scope, confirming that the Parties were referring to technical and economic operations linked to the exploitation of investments and not to the dispute settlement system.\"17\n\nIbid, paras. 142-145.\n\n40.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this conclusion is reinforced by Article 10 of the Treaty. This Article allows \"both investors and the [S]tate alike to resort to dispute settlement mechanisms. However, only investors engage in the activities referred to by the Protocol, since only they carry investment-related activities. Had the Convention [Treaty] wanted also to refer to the latter, the article should have been worded in more general terms.\"18 Furthermore, dispute settlement cannot be considered an activity of nationals or companies because they do not carry it out.19\n\nIbid. para. 147.\n\nIbid. para. 148.\n\n41.\n\nAnother argument put forward by the Respondent is that the matters covered by Article 3(1) and (2) of the Treaty are based on treatment that is national treatment. The Treaty ensures the same treatment to foreign and national investors and, therefore, \"the matters regulated by said provisions must be those enabling said identical treatment.\"20 The rules regarding dispute settlement are exceptional and exclusive to foreign investors, \"Consequently, it cannot be argued - at least, logically - that the dispute settlement system is comprised within the treatment obligations contained in Article 3(1) and (2)\".21\n\nIbid. para. 153.\n\nIbid. para. 154.\n\n42.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a harmonious interpretation of these Treaty provisions inevitably leads to exclusion of the dispute settlement provisions from the MFN clause. The exceptions in Article 3(3) and (4) and in the Protocol concerning tax advantages also show that these provisions refer to competitiveness of the investment as it is specifically mentioned in the Protocol Ad to Article 3(2).22\n\nIbid, paras. 155-160.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the Treaty structure also shows that, when the parties wanted to give the MFN clause a broader effect, they did so. In this respect, Argentina refers to the fact that there is an MFN clause in Article 4 but it does not refer to national treatment. Argentina explains that it would not make sense to include such treatment because the provisions of Article 4 are not in line with the rights enjoyed by national investors. On the other hand, the provisions of the Treaty on capital transfers (Article 5) or dispute settlement (Article 10) do not include either national treatment or MFN clauses. Neither of these provisions would apply to nationals, as is the case of Article 4, but this notwithstanding, there is no MFN clause in either of these articles.\n\n44.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the interpretation of the Treaty presented by the Claimant violates the principle of effective interpretation, namely, *ut res magis valeat quam pereat,* against Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties (\"the Vienna Convention\"). Article 4(4) would be superfluous, since it would be covered by Article 3(1) and (2) of the Treaty.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the rights conferred by Article 3 are different from those conferred under Article 10 and recalls that both parties to a dispute may, under Article 10, submit it to the local courts six months after its notification. In this context, Siemens confers on the MFN clause in Article 3 \"an exorbitant effect contrary to the most fundamental general principles of law: the effect of an implied and implicit waiver of a right expressly conferred by the Treaty.\"23 Argentina then states that \"at all events, the Argentine Republic requests that pursuant to the powers granted by article 10(2) of the Treaty, the dispute be submitted to competent federal courts.\"24\n\nIbid. para. 172.\n\nIbid. para. 174.\n\n46.\n\nArgentina then turns to a contextual interpretation of the MFN clause in Article 3. The Respondent first points out that conceptually the agreement to arbitrate is separable from the substantive provisions, and Article 3 deals with substantive provisions. Second, Argentina finds a similarity between the MFN clause and assignment and manifests that it is unquestionable that if the object of the assignment is the arbitration agreement per se, the party\u2019s consent is indispensable. Third, it argues that the principle *ejusdem generis* is even more restrictive regarding procedural and jurisdictional matters. Based on French case law, the Respondent concludes that, unless expressly provided for, the MFN clause does not implicitly extend to procedural matters.25\n\nIbid, paras. 175-187.\n\n47.\n\nArgentina then examines the understanding of the MFN clause under international law at the time the Treaty was executed. Argentina argues that in the two cases in which the ICJ has dealt with an MFN clause *(Anglo-Iranian Oil* and *U.S. Nationals in Morocco),* the ICJ \" opposed the application of the clause to extend the benefit of most-favored-nation to the jurisdictional scope.\"26 The Respondent also refers to the decision of the arbitration commission in *Ambatielos* and affirms that this commission decided on substantive standards of treatment and not jurisdictional commitments. Based on these three cases, the Respondent concludes that \"in light of the evolution of the international law at the time the Treaty was executed, not only can it be said that there were no elements to presume that the jurisdictional commitments under the Treaty belonged to the operating scope of the MFNC but that there were concrete elements to reach in the opposite direction.\"27\n\nIbid. para. 188. Underlined in the original.\n\nIbid. para. 202.\n\n48.\n\nArgentina maintains that the practice of the parties as regards investment treaties shows that, if the parties intended to include the dispute settlement system within the scope of application of the MFN clause, they expressly did so. This was the case of the Treaty between Argentina and Korea concerning the Mutual Encouragement and Protection of Investments, dated May 17, 1994. The United Kingdom has included a specific reference to dispute settlement in the MFN clause in some of its treaties but not in the Treaty for the Promotion and Protection of Investments entered into with Argentina on December 11, 1990. The Respondent also refers to the broad language of \"the Spain BIT\" but limits its importance because Spain does not accept that that agreement includes jurisdictional clauses in its MFN clause and therefore neither does Argentina.28\n\nIbid, paras. 206-208.\n\n49.\n\nArgentina emphasizes that the Treaty provision on settlement of disputes diverges from the alternatives provided by the German model investment treaty. From this fact, the Respondent draws two conclusions: \"The first is that the parties expressly adopted said dispute settlement mechanism. The second is that the parties considered said mechanism specially important and, albeit contrary to the policy favored in the German model treaty, they did not agree on a MFNC that may allow [to] surmount said situation in the future, in the event the Argentine Republic modifies its policy on the issue.\"29\n\nIbid. para. 211.\n\n50.\n\nArgentina expounds further on its BIT practice to show that not all the MFN clauses and dispute settlement clauses are the same and that they are specifically negotiated case by case, and \"in no case shall it be presumed that the issues concerning the way the Argentine Republic submit to international jurisdictions are not a part of its main public policies.\"30 According to the Respondent, the matters specifically considered by the contracting parties, and as decided in *TECMED v. Mexico,* cannot be included in the sphere of the MFN clause.31\n\nIbid. para. 217.\n\nIbid. para. 212.\n\n51.\n\nArgentina maintains that Article 10 of the Treaty reflects a \"moderation\" of the exhaustion of local remedies rule, and that the Treaty requires Siemens to use these remedies \"diligently- for at least 18 months, as a previous requisite before attempting to compromise the responsibility of the Argentine Republic under the Treaty before an international court.\"32 Siemens\u2019 interpretation arrives at \"the absurd situation whereby a supposed application of the rule that internal remedies are to be exhausted first would be tacitly waived. That, of course, is in contradiction with legal literature, case law and generally accepted international practice.\"33 Argentina refers to *ELSI,* in which the ICJ held that it finds itself \"unable to accept that an important principle of customary international law should be held to have been tacitly dispensed with, in the absence of any words making clear an intention to do so.\"34 Argentina also points out that limitations to a State\u2019s sovereignty should be treated restrictively and that it had warned Siemens on two occasions that the Chile BIT was not a valid basis for bringing this claim to ICSID without first pursuing it in the local courts.35\n\nIbid. para. 218.\n\nIbid. para. 219.\n\n*Case concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.* 1989 *ICJ Reports,* p. 50.\n\nIbid, paras. 221-227.\n\n52.\n\nArgentina then turns to *Maffezini,* and points out that notwithstanding the generality of the MFN clause, Spain considered that it did not cover matters of procedure. The tribunal recognized that it was necessary \"to determine whether the omission stems from the parties\u2019 intention, or whether the extension of the clause can be reasonably inferred from the parties\u2019 practice in their treatment of foreign investors and of their own investors.\"36 Argentina finds questionable the reasoning leading to the conclusion that the MFN clause in the Spain BIT covers the settlement of controversies, and that the Tribunal should bear in mind \"the specific framework of the tribunal\u2019s analysis, the non-binding nature of the case law precedents on third parties, and, if applicable, the distinction between the points meriting the tribunal\u2019s attention in order to arrive at the decision which of them were to be held and which of them were overabundant.\"37\n\n*Maffezini,* para. 53.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 232.\n\n53.\n\nArgentina finds incorrect the analysis of **Ambatielos** by the tribunal in *Maffezini.* Argentina considers that the decision in **Ambatielos** regarding administration of justice had a substantive content because what was disputed was whether, on the basis of the MFN clause, \"Mr. Ambatielos was entitled to receive a *just treatment,* an *equitable treatment,* and a *treatment according to law* from the English courts.\"38 Argentina also considers that that tribunal \"did not take adequate note of the significant differences between the substantive issues raised in that case and the issues of a jurisdictional nature that had to be decided in the Maffezini v. Spain case.\"39 Furthermore, the tribunal in *Maffezini* ignores *Anglo-Iranian Oil,* in which the ICJ \"conclusively affirmed the inapplicability of a MFNC to jurisdictional matters.\"40\n\nIbid. para. 235. Emphasis in the original.\n\nIbid. para. 237.\n\nIbid. para. 241.\n\n54.\n\nArgentina affirms that the conclusion reached by the tribunal in *Maffezini* is based on the description of situations such as the convenience of traders and investors and the relationship of substantive rights and dispute settlement mechanisms. It is not based, as it should be, on the source of relevant law: the intention of the parties. There is no specific analysis of the *ejusdem generis* principle. The only relevant reference is to the generality of the MFN clause. If this is the basis of the tribunal\u2019s conclusion, then the other statements regarding convenience of investors and the relationship of substantive and jurisdictional rights are in the nature of *obiter* *dicta41*\n\nIbid, paras. 242-249.\n\n55.\n\nArgentina is concerned that with its reasoning the tribunal in Maffezini \"inverted the order in the analysis and, by transforming the exception into a rule and vice versa, it grants priority to the access to mechanisms for the settlement of disputes which are special over essential international law principles\"42.\n\nIbid. para. 249.\n\n56.\n\nArgentina maintains that Siemens cannot refuse to comply with the provisions of the Treaty because they are of a procedural nature or because resort to local courts is useless or expensive. Argentina points out that Siemens switches from one treaty to another, which is not consistent with the prohibition of contradiction to the prejudice of a third party, a fact that the Respondent requests the Tribunal to take into account.43 In any case, the treaties referred to by Siemens in support of its argument are not applicable since they have dispute settlement mechanisms that do not require \" a previous, effective and diligent use of national jurisdiction \". They all require simply a waiting period related to negotiations.44\n\nIbid. para. 260.\n\nIbid. para. 262. Emphasis in the original.\n\n57.\n\nArgentina recalls that its consent to international arbitration is subject to the requirement of bringing the dispute to the local courts in a first stage. This \"not only implies aspects related to the legal source of the consent to arbitration jurisdiction, but it is also related to sensitive economic policy and foreign policy issues. In short, such term constitutes an essential element of the exceptional jurisdictional offer made in investment treaties.\"45\n\nIbid. para. 263.\n\n58.\n\nIt cannot be argued, maintains Argentina, that the situation has changed regarding legal costs in Argentina or that the judiciary in Argentina is more inefficient than it was when the Treaty was signed. On both counts the situation remains the same. The Tribunal cannot redefine the Treaty without incurring in \"a serious and clear excess of powers which would not only invalidate the whole proceeding, but would seriously cause the new system for international protection of investment to lose prestige.\"46\n\nIbid. para. 268.\n\n59.\n\nAs a final point, Argentina finds that the Tribunal should not consider as purely temporal the requisite that investors bring an investment dispute before a local court. In this respect, Argentina recalls that the tribunal *in Maffezini* held \"the courts of the Contracting Parties are given an opportunity to vindicate the international obligations guaranteed in the BIT. Given the language of the treaty, this is a role which the Contracting Parties can be presumed to have wished to retain for their courts, albeit within a prescribed time limit. Second, Claimant\u2019s interpretation of Article X(2) would deprive this provision of any meaning, a result that would not be compatible with generally accepted principles of treaty interpretation, particularly those of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties.\"47\n\nIbid. para. 270. Emphasis in the original.\n\n***(b) Position of the Claimant***\n----------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nSiemens contests the restrictive interpretation of the Treaty on which Argentina bases its case. The Vienna Convention requires that the provisions of a treaty be interpreted in good faith. Applying this principle to a reading of the Treaty and the MFN clause leads Siemens to the conclusion that this clause comprises all matters covered by the Treaty, except those expressly excluded in Article 3(3) and (4) and Ad Article 3(b) of the Protocol and the Reversal Note dated April 9, 1991. Siemens considers that \"The mechanisms for the settlement of disputes are part of the guarantees for the promotion and protection of foreign investments granted to the investors, being international arbitration for the settlement of investment disputes before ICSID one of the most relevant of them.\"48\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 69.\n\n61.\n\nSiemens argues that it has a right to invoke relevant case law in support of its claim without it being a violation of Article 53 of the Convention. Argentina misconceives Siemens\u2019 reliance on the legal authority arising from *Mafezzini.* It is clear to Siemens that the principle of *res inter alios acta* has no relevance in the operation of an MFN clause.49\n\nIbid, paras. 72-73.\n\n62.\n\nAccording to Siemens, Article 3 of the Treaty relates to the *treatment* granted to investments and investors. It is not logical to protect the investment and deny this protection to its owner. The treatment under the Treaty is not restricted to any particular substantive standards of treatment: \"The MFN treatment is contained in a separate clause without any distinction concerning a specific matter which could limit the scope of application of the clause.\"50\n\nIbid, paras. 77 and 79.\n\n63.\n\nSiemens finds that Article 3(2) extends rather than limits the application of the MFN clause. The term \"activity\" is broad and inclusive and the list of activities enumerated in the Protocol is preceded by the words \"especially but not exclusively\". According to Siemens, \"The settlement of an investment dispute falls within this term; particularly, the exercise by an investor of its right of action to solve an investment claim under the Treaty is a clear example of an activity in connection with investments pursuant to this Article.\"51 Even if it would be possible to interpret the term \"activity\" restrictively under the Treaty, \"the management, maintenance, use and enjoyment of an investment\" described in the Protocol are terms that encompass activities in the context of dispute settlement. It is a normal feature of the management and operation of an enterprise to participate in litigation. The power to bring legal action is a classical part of management.\"52\n\nIbid, paras. 83 and 85.\n\nIbid. para. 87.\n\n64.\n\nSiemens argues that it is irrelevant to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal whether the State may also resort to the dispute settlement provided for in the Treaty. This should not be a reason \"to deny an investor\u2019s right to institute arbitration under conditions not-less favourable than the third State\u2019s investors.\" Siemens\u2019 right is independent of the State\u2019s right,53\n\nIbid, paras. 91-92.\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimant rebuts the link established by Argentina between national treatment and MFN treatment. The Claimant finds that there is no basis in the Treaty for such reading. In fact, the Treaty provides MFN treatment and national treatment as alternative standards of protection; they are independent and can be invoked by the foreign investor independently of each other. This understanding of Article 3 of the Treaty is confirmed by the ILC\u2019s Commentary to draft Article 19(1):\n\n\"[I]n the presence of the most-favored-nation treatment, national treatment and any other treatment accorded by the granting State with respect to the same subject-matter, the beneficiary State not only ha[s] an \u2018either/or\u2019 choice, but might also be in a position to opt for the cumulative enjoyment of all, some, or parts of the various treatments concerned. [...] [W]henever the beneficiary State is accorded different types of treatment with respect to the same subject-matter, it shall be entitled to whichever treatment or combination of treatments it prefers in any particular case.\"54\n\nIbid. para. 103, citation.\n\n66.\n\nSiemens reaches the opposite conclusion as the Respondent regarding the exceptions included in Article 3 and the inclusion of an additional MFN clause in Article 4. The MFN clause in Article 3 applies \"to the \u2018agreed sphere of relations\u2019 covered by the Treaty as a whole, except where the contracting parties negotiated its exclusion, which is not the case with dispute settlement.\"55\n\nIbid. para. 108.\n\n67.\n\nAs regards Article 4, the existence of a specialized provision does not negate the effect of an MFN clause not attached to a particular provision; if it would, it would negate the meaning of Article 3 altogether. The MFN clause in that article can be read differently from the clause in Article 3: \"while the general MFNC is subject to the exceptions contained in Article 3(3) and (4), these exceptions do not apply in the case of Article 4 \"56 There are also differences between the two clauses as regards national treatment. National treatment in Article 4 is limited to the case covered by Article 4(3).57\n\nIbid. para. 114.\n\nIbid, footnote 102.\n\n68.\n\nSiemens considers irrelevant the arguments made by Argentina regarding severability, Kompetenz-Kompetenz and assignment. The Claimant maintains that the considerations that apply to severability bear no relationship to the status of the MFN clause. The authority of the Tribunal to decide its own competence has also no relationship to the issue of the MFN clause, except that the Tribunal has the power to decide on the effect of the MFN clause on its competence. As regards assignment, there is \"neither an assignor nor an assignee in the application of an MFN clause.\"58\n\nIbid, paras. 116-119.\n\n69.\n\nSiemens argues that the principle of *ejusdem generis* does not preclude the application of the MFN clause as intended by Siemens. According to Siemens, Argentina misconstrues this principle and its effects. Siemens disputes that the Report of the ILC on MFN clauses or the ILC\u2019s commentary provide any basis for a restrictive interpretation with respect to the *ejusdem generis* principle or for the requirement of an express reference for an MFN clause to cover procedural or jurisdictional matters. The same can be said of the cases cited by the Respondent. The Treaty does refer to jurisdictional and procedural issues. The principle *ejusdem generis* requires only that the MFN clause and the clause relied on in the third-party treaty both relate to jurisdiction. The subject matters of the Treaty and the Chile BIT are identical.59\n\nIbid, paras. 123-127.\n\n70.\n\nSiemens also finds mistaken the interpretation made by Argentina of *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco* and *Ambatielos.* *Anglo-Iranian Co.,* was decided mainly on considerations of inter-temporal law. The treaties in question had no relation to jurisdictional matters and therefore the claimant was, on the basis of the MFN clause, unable to rely on other treaties for purposes of jurisdiction.60 In *Rights of Nationals* the ICJ found that \"a broadly worded MFN clause in a treaty that dealt with a number of diverse matters, including jurisdiction, entitled the beneficiary to claim jurisdictional privileges contained in treaties with third parties. The only reason why the jurisdictional privileges were ultimately denied was that they had expired since the rights arising from the third party treaties had come to an end.\"61 As regards *Ambatielos,* Siemens contests that the matter at issue was related to substantive standards of treatment and not to procedural jurisdictional agreements.62 Siemens finds that, when the Commission referred to \"the administration of justice\", it did not make any distinction between substantive and procedural rights relating to it. The important finding of the Commission was that \"Protection of the rights of traders naturally finds a place among the matters dealt with by treaties of commerce and navigation.\"63 Siemens considers this finding particularly relevant for purposes of \"activities in connection with investments\" (Article 3(2) of the Treaty).64\n\nIbid. para. 131.\n\nIbid. para. 133.\n\nIbid. para. 139.\n\nIbid. para. 140.\n\nIbid. para. 142.\n\n71.\n\nSiemens then turns to BIT state practice in general and of Argentina in particular and concludes that MFN clauses conceived in broad terms are the rule rather than the exception. The practice of Argentina also shows that there is no consistency regarding access to international arbitration in terms of waiting period and prior recourse to the local courts. This inconsistency is such that it cannot be argued, as Argentina does, that recourse first to the local courts is part of Argentina\u2019s public policy. On the contrary, \"the situation described by Argentina with respect to provisions on dispute settlement in its recent BITs is a typical case for the application of an MFNC. The diverse regulations on access to international arbitration in different BITs, create a situation that discriminates against investors of certain nationalities.\"65 The effect of the MFN clause is to harmonize the conditions applicable to investors irrespective of their nationality. Siemens considers that \"the existence of treaties with diverse provisions is not an argument against the application of an MFNC but a necessary precondition for its application.\"66\n\nIbid. para. 170.\n\nIbid.\n\n72.\n\nAs regards the fact that the terms of Article 10 of the Treaty are at variance with those of the German model bilateral investment treaty and therefore show that they were specifically negotiated, Siemens argues that this cannot be considered a reason for excluding Article 10 provisions from the application of the MFN clause: \"There is no evidence that MFNCs are applicable only to treaty provisions that were not subject to negotiations.\"67\n\nIbid. para. 168.\n\n73.\n\nSiemens also disputes the consequences attributed by Argentina to *TECMED.* In that case, the arbitral tribunal found that *\"TECMED* should be distinguished from the *Maffezini* case because of the substantial rather than procedural or jurisdictional nature of the matter in question [as *in Maffezini],* Since the matter at issue in the present case is almost identical to the one in *Maffezini,* the decision in *TECMED* can only confirm Siemens\u2019 claim rather than oppose it.\"68\n\nIbid. para. 162.\n\n74.\n\nSiemens rebuts the arguments of Argentina on the findings of *Maffezini* and their application to this case. First, the different wording of the two MFN clauses was not significant to the decision in Maffezini. The tribunal based its conclusion on the inextricable linkage of the protection of foreign investors with dispute settlement arrangements and not on the words \"all matters\" of the MFN clause in the Chile BIT. Second, it is not necessary to have the express will of the parties to consider dispute settlement to be included in the MFN clause. The will of the parties can be \"reasonably inferred\", and it can be inferred in the Treaty.69\n\nIbid, paras. 180-183.\n\n75.\n\nSiemens maintains that the main considerations of the tribunal in *Maffezini* apply in this case: Both treaties are in the same category and contain provisions almost identical on dispute settlement; the wording of the two MFN clauses does not reveal significant difference in its scope of application; in the Treaty this clause is self-standing, while in the Chile BIT it is in an article that deals with a particular aspect of treatment, hence the need to emphasize that it applies to all matters. Argentina\u2019s BIT practice shows that \"it has sought to obtain a dispute settlement method for its investors abroad more favorable than that granted under the Treaty to foreign investors in its territory.\" None of the limitations mentioned in *Mafezzini* apply to this case: the procedural requirement is exactly the same in both cases and it does not reflect a question of fundamental public policy. Siemens concludes that Argentina has failed to distinguish this case from *Maffezini70*\n\nIbid. para. 184.\n\n76.\n\nSiemens finds that the criticisms of *Maffezini* regarding the interpretation of ***Ambatielos*** are not justified. The MFN clause in ***Ambatielos*** did not have a wider range than in *Mafezzini.* The clause in ***Ambatielos*** covers administration of justice as much as *Mafezzini* covers dispute settlement. There is no basis in *Ambatielos* to distinguish between substantive rights related to the administration of justice and jurisdictional agreements. Provisions concerning both the administration of justice and dispute settlement refer to mechanisms for the protection of rights. Siemens finds equally unjustified the criticisms of *Maffezini* for failing to give legal reasons to support the application of the *ejusdem generis* principle in that case, for failure to apply logic, for confusing facts and law, for not giving priority to customary international rules over the BIT and the Convention, and for not taking into account that the 18-month period was a moderate conventional form of the exhaustion of remedies rule.71\n\nIbid. para. 194\n\n77.\n\nSiemens rebuts Argentina\u2019s arguments related to the requirement of Article 10 to have recourse first to the local courts. According to Argentina, this requirement is \"nothing but a moderated form of the exhaustion of local remedies rule,\"72 and the exhaustion of local remedies cannot be tacitly waived by operation of the the MFN clause. Siemens recalls that Article 26 of the Convention reverses the order and unless there is an explicit condition to exhaust local remedies, the rule does not apply. The State Parties did not limit their consent to arbitration to the exhaustion of local remedies when the they signed the Convention or the Treaty. In any case, there is a difference between the requirement to exhaust local remedies and one compelling resort to domestic courts for a limited period of time. The second requirement is merely a rule of procedure, the parties may pursue arbitration after the time has lapsed.73\n\nIbid. para. 197.\n\nIbid, paras. 197-203.\n\n78.\n\nSiemens considers that resort to the local courts would be a futile exercise since it is well known, and Siemens submitted an expert opinion in this respect, that it is impossible for the local courts to decide a case of this nature within the 18 months provided for in the Treaty. Siemens refers to the practice of the ICJ and other tribunals to show that \"[they] have generally refused to regard non-compliance with clauses providing for waiting periods as an obstacle to their jurisdiction. In rejecting objections to their jurisdiction based on such clauses, they have emphasized the evident futility of resorting to the alternative means for dispute settlement presented by these clauses.\"74 Argentina\u2019s insistence on Siemens resorting to the local courts serves only the purpose of obstructing these arbitration proceedings with meaningless delays and disproportionate expenses. According to Siemens, to insist upon a procedure that is incapable of achieving its intended result is contrary to the requirement of performing treaty obligations in good faith75\n\nIbid. para. 205.\n\nIbid, paras. 229-230.\n\n***(c) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe following issues emerge from the arguments exchanged by the parties:\n\n(i) Interpretation of the Treaty.\n\n(ii) General or specific character of the MFN clauses in Article 3.\n\n(iii) If the MFN clauses in Article 3 are considered general clauses, rationale of the MFN clause in Article 4.\n\n(iv) Protection of investments or investors.\n\n(v) Effect of reference to national treatment on the scope of the MFN clause.\n\n(vi) Treatment of investors and dispute settlement.\n\n(vii) Exhaustion of local remedies.\n\n(viii) Significance of negotiated changes in the model form of German BIT.\n\n(ix) Effect on the scope of the MFN clause of the right of the State to bring the dispute to its courts.\n\n(x) Claim of a benefit under a treaty by the operation of an MFN clause as triggering application of all the provisions of that treaty.\n\n*(i) Interpretation of the Treaty*\n----------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nBoth parties have based their arguments on the interpretation of the Treaty in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention. This Article provides that a treaty be \"interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" The Tribunal will adhere to these rules of interpretation in considering the disputed provisions of the Treaty. The first question posed by the Respondent\u2019s allegations is whether the Treaty should be interpreted restrictively or broadly.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Treaty has to be interpreted neither liberally nor restrictively, as neither of these adverbs is part of Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention. The Tribunal shall be guided by the purpose of the Treaty as expressed in its title and preamble. It is a treaty \"to protect\" and \"to promote\" investments. The preamble provides that the parties have agreed to the provisions of the Treaty for the purpose of creating favorable conditions for the investments of nationals or companies of one of the two States in the territory of the other State. Both parties recognize that the promotion and protection of these investments by a treaty may stimulate private economic initiative and increase the well-being of the peoples of both countries.76 The intention of the parties is clear. It is to create favorable conditions for investments and to stimulate private initiative.\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal.\n\n*(ii) General or Specific Character of the MFN Clauses in Article 3*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThere are three clauses in the Treaty that refer to MFN treatment: Article 3(1), Article 3(2) and Article 4(4). The Tribunal will consider first the MFN clauses in Article 3, which for ease of reference are reproduced here:\n\nArticle 3(1): None of the Contracting Parties shall accord in its territory to the investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party or to investments in which they hold shares, a less favorable treatment than the treatment granted to the investments of its own nationals or companies or to the investments of nationals or companies of third States.\n\nArticle 3(2): None of the Contracting Parties shall accord in its territory to nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party a less favorable treatment of activities related to investments than granted to its own nationals and companies or to the nationals and companies of third States.77\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal.\n\n83.\n\nThe exceptions in Article 3 to no less favorable treatment refer to privileges agreed in the context of customs or economic unions and of free trade areas (Article 3(3)), and to advantages granted in taxation-related agreements (Article 3(4)). The Protocol complements these exceptions by excluding measures dictated by internal or external security or public order concerns, and the fiscal advantages, exemptions or reductions granted to each Contracting Party\u2019s nationals or companies (Ad Article 3 (a) and (b)). In addition, the Protocol states that \"activities\" refers \"specially but not exclusively to the administration, use and benefit of an investment\", and that measures that affect the purchase of raw materials and other inputs and means of production in or outside each Contracting Party will be, \"specially but not exclusively\", considered measures of less than favorable treatment (Ad Article 3 (a)).\n\n84.\n\nBased on the exceptions and the provisions of the Protocol, the Respondent has alleged that the treatment envisaged in Article 3 is limited to Article 3 itself and refers to treatment of transactions of a commercial and economic nature in relation to exploitation and management of investments. According to the Respondent, the treatment intended by the parties is related to the competitiveness of the investments.\n\n85.\n\nThe first two clauses of Article 3 refer simply to a \"not less favorable treatment\" -\"trato no menos favorable\" in the Spanish version. \"Treatment\" in its ordinary meaning refers to behavior in respect of an entity or a person. The term \"treatment\" is neither qualified nor described except by the expression \"not less favorable\". The term \"activities\" is equally general. The need for exceptions confirms the generality of the meaning of treatment or activities rather than setting limits beyond what is said in the exceptions. In clarifying in the Protocol the term \"activities\" used in Article 3(2), the drafters were careful to qualify twice that the clarification is special but not exclusive. This is a clear indication that the clarifications do not limit the meaning of the term \"activities\". They simply emphasize matters of particular concern to the parties. When the parties meant to provide an outright limitation by way of an exception they have done so in paragraphs (3) and (4) of Article 3 and in the Protocol in relation to security measures or taxation privileges of nationals or national companies. If it were the intention to limit the content of Article 3 beyond the limits of those exceptions, then the terms \"treatment\" or \"activities\" would have been qualified. The fact that this is not the case is an indication of their intended wide scope. Treatment in Article 3 refers to treatment under the Treaty in general and not only under that article.\n\n86.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that a plain and contextual reading of Article 3(1) and (2) does not limit the treatment to transactions of a commercial and economic nature in relation to exploitation and management of investments as alleged by Argentina. This understanding of Article 3(1) and (2) is reinforced by the consideration that the term \"companies\", as defined in the Treaty, includes \"companies or associations [...] independently from whether or not the purpose of their activity is the pursuit of profit\"78 The competitiveness argument advanced by Argentina would effectively exclude non-profit organizations from protection under the Treaty.\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal.\n\n*(iii) Rationale of the MFN Clause in Article 4*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal needs to address now the question of the relationship of Articles 3 and 4, since the Respondent has argued that, if the MFN clause in Article 3 would cover more than Article 3 itself, then Article 4 would be superfluous. This result would be against treaty interpretation rules that require that a meaning be attributed to each clause.\n\n88.\n\nArticle 4 provides that:\n\n\"(1) The investments of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall enjoy full protection and legal security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\n(2) [This paragraph deals with expropriation and compensation and is not necessary to reproduce for the present discussion]\n\n(3) The nationals or companies of one of the Contracting Parties that suffer losses in their investments because of war or other armed conflict, revolution, national state of emergency or insurrection in the territory of the other Contracting Party, shall not be treated by such party less favorably than its own nationals or companies as to restitution, compensation, indemnities or other. These payments will be freely transferable.\n\n(4) The nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall enjoy in the territory of the other Contracting Party the treatment of the most favored nation in all matters covered in this Article.\"79\n\nTranslation of the Tribunal.\n\n89.\n\nFor purposes of considering the Respondent\u2019s interpretation, the Tribunal needs to consider in detail the provisions of Article 4 in comparison with Article 3. The Tribunal notes first that Article 4(4) is restricted to \"matters covered in this Article\". No such limitation exists in Article 3. The Article 4 MFN clause further refers to nationals or national companies, a subjective element which is lacking in Article 3(1). Whether this is significant the Tribunal will discuss later in considering the differentiation between investments and investors argued by Argentina. There is no reference to national treatment except in Article 4(3) in relation to losses caused by war or disturbances. Only Article 3 refers to investments jointly owned by the foreign investor with nationals or national companies of the Contracting Party where the investment has been made.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes from this textual comparison that references to MFN treatment or to national treatment in Article 4 do not detract from the generality of Article 3 nor make Article 4 superfluous. To the extent that there is an overlap, it needs to be understood as covering areas of special interest to the parties. Compensation on account of expropriation or of civil war or other violent disturbances is a key issue in the treatment of foreign investment and foreign nationals and a specific reference to it would seem congruent with its importance. The Tribunal considers that the parties to a treaty are not precluded from placing emphasis on certain matters *ex abundante cautela.* The repeated provision in a particular context stresses the concern of the parties in respect of that particular matter rather than limiting the scope of clauses of general character.\n\n*(iv) Protection of Investments or Investors*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nArgentina has drawn a difference between the protection of investors and of investments and reached conclusions which affect the applicability of the MFN clause under the Treaty. Investment is referred to in the context of fair and equal treatment, full protection under the Treaty and protection against discriminatory or arbitrary measures (Article 2), MFN treatment (Article 3(1)), full protection and legal security, expropriation, (Article 4(1) and (2)), and more favorable treatment resulting from future developments in international law or general agreements (Article 7). The expression \"in relation to investments\" is found in the context of activities under the MFN clause (Article 3(2)), free transfer of payments (Article 5), applicability of the Treaty retroactively (Article 8), and dispute settlement (Article 10). Foreign investors appear in the provisions on privileges granted under customs or economic unions or free trade areas (Article 3(3)), advantages granted under taxation agreements (Article 3(4)), national treatment in case of war or civil disturbance (Article 4(3)), general treatment under Article 4, free transfer of payments (Article 5), payments under guarantees (Article 6), and dispute settlement (Article 10).\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 3 refers to treatment of investments in paragraph (1), while the exceptions refer to investors. On the other hand, there is a double reference to investments and investors in Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 4, respectively. It could be argued based on this use of the terms \"investments\" and \"investors\" that the exceptions in Article 3 do not apply to investments and that unless in each case both terms are used, as it is the case in Article 4, then the provision concerned applies only to one or the other as the case may be. The Tribunal has difficulty with such argument. The Treaty is a treaty to promote and protect investments, investors do not figure in the title. Fair and equitable treatment would be reserved to investments, and denial of justice to an investor would be excluded. While these considerations may follow a strict logical reasoning based on the terms of the Treaty, their result does not seem to accord with its purpose. More consistent with it is to consider that, in Article 3, treatment of the investments includes treatment of the investors and hence the need to provide for exceptions that refer to them. In the same vein, the reference to investors and investments in Article 4 is a matter of emphasis, not of exclusion. In other instances, the subjective element is just a matter of plain common sense, e.g., in clauses dealing with the transfer of payments, dispute settlement, and activities in relation to investments: these actions need to be taken by a person, physical or legal. The Tribunal finds that, for purposes of applying the MFN clause, there is no special significance to the differential use of the terms investor or investments in the Treaty.\n\n*(v) Effect of Reference to National Treatment on the Scope of the MFN Clause*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe reference to national treatment in Article 3(1) and (2) is provided as one alternative, the other being treatment not less favorable than the treatment granted to nationals or to nationals or companies of a third State. The obligation is dual. The State has undertaken not to give treatment less favorable in *either* situation. It may happen that advantages granted to nationals of a third State result in more favorable treatment than that enjoyed by the nationals of the grantor State. In that situation, reference to national treatment does not limit the advantages that investors may have by operation of the MFN clause. The obligations of the State under Article 3(1) and (2) refer to a minimum level of treatment, not a ceiling. If advantages granted to nationals of a third State would not be granted under the MFN clause simply because they exceed national treatment, then the State would breach the obligation to grant not less favorable treatment under that clause. The simple ordinary meaning of this clause is that investors should not be discriminated against for being foreigners and at the same time should be given the best treatment afforded any other foreign investor. This treatment is irrespective of whether the investment has been made solely by foreign investors or jointly or in association with local investors.\n\n*(vi) Treatment of Investors and Dispute Settlement*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThere has been extensive discussion by the parties as to whether settlement of disputes is or is not part of the protection given to investors. The parties have based their allegations on conflicting interpretations of *Anglo Iranian Oil, Rights of U.S. Nationals in* *Morocco,* and *Ambatielos.*\n\n95.\n\nIn *Anglo-Iranian Oil* the United Kingdom had argued that, upon the coming into force of the Iranian-Danish Treaty on March 6th 1935, Iran became bound, by the operation of the MFN clause in the treaties of 1857 and 1903 between Iran and the United Kingdom, to treat British nationals in its territory in accordance with the principles and practice of international law. The ICJ stated that:\n\n*Without considering the meaning and the scope of the most-favored-nation clause,* the Court confines itself to stating that this clause is contained in the Treaties of 1857 and 1903 between Iran and the United Kingdom, which are not subsequent to the ratification of the Iranian Declaration [accepting the Court\u2019s jurisdiction]. While Iran is bound by her obligations under these Treaties as long as they are in force, the United Kingdom is not entitled to rely upon them for the purpose of establishing the jurisdiction of the Court, since they are excluded by the terms of the Declaration.80\n\nICJ *Reports,* p. 109. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n96.\n\nAs stated by the ICJ itself, it is clear that the ICJ did not consider the \"meaning or scope of the MFN clause\", including whether the clause would extend to settlement of disputes. The finding that the United Kingdom could not base its case on the MFN clauses included in the treaties of 1857 and 1903 was not related to these clauses as such but to the declaration of Iran accepting the jurisdiction of the ICJ, which excluded treaties executed prior to the date of the declaration.\n\n97.\n\nAs regards the *Rights of US Nationals in Morocco,* the ICJ considered the scope of the MFN clause in a treaty between the United States and Morocco of 1836, specifically, Articles 14 and 24. Article 14 provides:\n\nThe commerce with the United States shall be on the same footing as is the commerce with Spain, or as that with the most favored nation for the time being; and their citizens shall be respected and esteemed, and have full liberty to pass and repass our country and sea-ports whenever they please, without interruption.\n\nArticle 24 in part provides:\n\n[A]nd it is further declared, that whatever indulgence, in trade or otherwise, shall be granted to any of the Christian powers, the citizens of the United States shall be equally entitled to them.\n\n98.\n\nAccording to the ICJ, \"These articles entitle the United States to invoke the provisions of other treaties relating to the capitulatory regime.\"81 As described by the ICJ, \"The most extensive privileges in the matter of consular jurisdiction granted by Morocco were those which were contained in the General Treaty with Great Britain of 1856 and in the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Spain of 1861. Under the provisions of Article IX of the British Treaty, there was a grant of consular jurisdiction in all cases, civil and criminal, when British nationals were defendants.\" Similar protection was granted to Spanish defendants.82 The ICJ stated: \"Accordingly, the United States acquired by virtue of the most-favoured nation clauses, civil and criminal consular jurisdiction in all cases in which United States nationals were defendants.\"83\n\nICJ *Reports* 1952, p. 190.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n99.\n\nIt is evident that the ICJ accepted that MFN clauses may extend to provisions related to jurisdictional matters, but this was not really the issue between the parties. The issue in that case was different. Spain and the United Kingdom had renounced their capitulatory rights and privileges and the US contended that its rights through the MFN clause persisted beyond that renunciation. The ICJ found otherwise. Benefits available due to an MFN clause last as long as the treaty that grants them is in effect, but they do not become incorporated into the treaty containing the MFN clause. If Spain and the United Kingdom would not have renounced their capitulatory rights, the United States would have been entitled to identical rights under the MFN clause of the 1836 treaty.\n\n100.\n\nIn *Ambatielos,* the question was whether the MFN clause - Article X of the 1886 treaty between the United Kingdom and Greece - extended to the administration of justice. Article X, provided in part: \"it being their [the Contracting Parties\u2019] intention that the trade and navigation of each country shall be placed, in all respects, by the other on the footing of the most favoured nation.\"84\n\nUnited Nations: *Reports of International Arbitral Awards,* Vol. XII, p. 106.\n\n101.\n\nThe United Kingdom had contended that the MFN clause could attract only matters belonging to the same category of subject as the case itself. The arbitral Commission agreed but found that in that case the rule led to conclusions different from the United Kingdom\u2019s submissions. According to the Commission:\n\nIt is true that \"the administration of justice\", when viewed in isolation, is a subject-matter other than \"commerce and navigation\", but this is not necessarily so when it is viewed in connection with the protection of the rights of traders. Protection of the rights of traders naturally finds a place among the matters dealt with by Treaties of commerce and navigation.\n\nTherefore it cannot be said that the administration of justice, in so far as it is concerned with the protection of these rights, must necessarily be excluded from the field of application of the most-favoured-nation clause, when the latter includes \"all matters relating to commerce and navigation.85\n\nIbid. p. 107.\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that, in *Ambatielos,* administration of justice refers to substantive procedural rights like just and equitable treatment and not to purely jurisdictional matters. The Tribunal does not find any basis in the reasoning of the Commission to justify such distinction. On the other hand, the Tribunal finds that the Treaty itself, together with so many other treaties of investment protection, has as a distinctive feature special dispute settlement mechanisms not normally open to investors. Access to these mechanisms is part of the protection offered under the Treaty. It is part of the treatment of foreign investors and investments and of the advantages accessible through a MFN clause.\n\n103.\n\nThis conclusion concurs with the findings of the arbitral tribunal *in Maffezini.* In that case, the investor claimed advantages under the Treaty between Spain and Chile for the Protection and Encouragement of Investments, dated October 2, 1991. The Respondent has emphatically stated that the MFN clause in the basic treaty in *Maffezini -* the Spain BIT - is different from the MFN clause in the Treaty and that **Maffezini** has to be considered in its own context. The Tribunal notes that the MFN clause in the Spain BIT refers to \"all matters subject to this Agreement\"86, while the MFN clause in the Treaty refers only to \"treatment\". The arbitral tribunal in **Maffezini** noted that Spain had used the expression \"all matters subject to this Agreement\" only in the case of its BIT with Argentina and \"this treatment\" in all other cases. The said tribunal commented that the latter was \"of course a narrower formulation\".87 The Tribunal concurs that the formulation is narrower but, as concluded above, it considers that the term \"treatment\" and the phrase \"activities related to the investments\" are sufficiently wide to include settlement of disputes.\n\n*Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of January 25, 2000, para. 60.\n\nIbid.\n\n*(vii) Exhaustion of Local Remedies*\n------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that Article 10(2) is a \"moderate\" version of the exhaustion of local remedies rule and that that rule may not be tacitly waived. It is an essential element of its consent to arbitration and is related to sensitive economic and foreign policy issues. The Tribunal concurs with the Respondent in that the Contracting Parties had intended through 10(2) to give the local tribunals an opportunity to decide a dispute first before it would be submitted to international arbitration. However, this does not mean that this provision requires the exhaustion of local remedies as this rule has been understood under international law.88 Article 10(2) does not require a prior final decision of the courts of the Respondent. It does not even require a prior decision of a court at any level. It simply requires the passing of time or the persistence of the dispute after a decision by a court. Then, even if this decision is one subject to appeal, the requirement of Article 10(2) would have been fulfilled. For these reasons, the Tribunal considers that Article 10(2) is not comparable to the local remedies rule and the issue of a tacit waiver of a rule of international law does not arise.\n\nIbid. para. 28.\n\n105.\n\nAs to the claim that Article 10(2) reflects the policy of Argentina, the Respondent has not presented any evidence beyond its affirmations to this effect in the written pleadings. The Tribunal would consider an indication of the existence of a policy of the Respondent if a certain requirement has been consistently included in similar treaties executed by the Respondent. The Chile BIT was signed on August 2, 1991, only a few months before the Treaty. The Spain BIT was entered into on October 3, 1991. The US-Argentina BIT, which does not require institution of judicial proceedings prior to arbitration, was executed on November 14, 1991. This lack of consistency among the BITs entered into by the Respondent during the same year as the Treaty was signed does not support the argument that the institution of proceedings before the local courts is a \"sensitive\" issue of economic or foreign policy or that it is an essential part of the consent of the Respondent to arbitration. The Respondent has sought for its own nationals as investors in Chile or the United States similar treatment to that sought by the Claimant in these proceedings.\n\n*(viii) Significance of Negotiated Changes in the Model Form of German BIT*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent has stressed the fact that the dispute settlement clause departs from the standard bilateral investment treaty of Germany in order to support its argument that this was a clause specially negotiated and hence which should be differentiated from the rest. The acceptance of a clause from a model text does not invest this clause with either more or less legal force than other clauses which may had been more difficult to negotiate. The end result of the negotiations is an agreed text and the legal significance of each clause is not affected by how arduous was the negotiating path to arrive there. The Tribunal feels bound, in its interpretation of the Treaty, by the expressed intention of the parties to promote investments and create conditions favorable to them. The Tribunal finds that when the intention of the parties has been clearly expressed, it is not in its power to second-guess their intentions by attributing special meaning to phrases based on whether they were or were not part of a model draft. As already noted, the term \"treatment\" is so general that the Tribunal cannot limit its application except as specifically agreed by the parties. In fact, the purpose of the MFN clause is to eliminate the effect of specially negotiated provisions unless they have been excepted. It complements the undertaking of each State Party to the Treaty not to apply measures discriminatory to investments under Article 2.\n\n*(ix) Effect on the Scope of the MFN Clause of the Right of the State to Bring the Dispute Before its Courts*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe parties have argued whether the right of the State to submit the dispute to its own courts under Article 10 of the Treaty affects the MFN clause since such provision is not included in the Chile BIT. In terms of the facts of the case, this issue seems to be of a theoretical nature since the Respondent could have submitted this dispute to the local tribunals and did not before an ICSID arbitral tribunal was seized of it. Whether in the abstract such right of the State precludes the application of the MFN clause to dispute settlement under the Treaty, the Tribunal considers it not to be such an obstacle here, for the simple reason that the State could have brought a dispute with the Claimant to its own courts at any time before this Tribunal became seized of it. The BITs do not restrict the rights of investors or the State to pursue a dispute before the local courts. They provide an additional venue normally not open to investors.89\n\nThe Spain BIT provides for a similar right. This matter does not seem to have been discussed in *Maffezini.*\n\n*(x) Claim of a Benefit under a Treaty by the Operation of an MFN Clause as Triggering the Application of All the Provisions of that Treaty*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nAs regards the issue of whether the claim of a benefit under an MFN clause triggers application of the whole treaty, it depends on the terms of the clause, but only to the extent that it is advantageous to the beneficiary of the clause. The MFN clause would be of limited use otherwise. This understanding does not mean that the investor in Argentina will enjoy a more favorable treatment than the investor in Chile. The MFN clause works both ways. The investor in Chile will be able to claim similar benefits under the Chile BIT.\n\n109.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal considers that, as a general matter, claiming a benefit by the operation of an MFN clause does not carry with it the acceptance of all the terms of the treaty which provides for such benefit whether or not they are considered beneficial to the party making the claim; neither does it entail that the claiming party has access to all benefits under such treaty. This will depend on the terms of the MFN clause and other terms of the treaties involved. The Tribunal concurs with *Maffezini* that the beneficiary of the MFN clause may not override public policy considerations judged by the parties to a treaty essential to their agreement.90 As already indicated, the Tribunal considers that the public policy considerations adduced by the Respondent are not applicable.91\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, paras. 62-63.\n\nSupra, para. 105.\n\n110.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal rejects the first objection to its jurisdiction.\n\n**3. Second Objection: The Dispute Was Submitted to the Local Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Position of the Respondent***\n------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nArgentina argues that if Siemens may rely on the Chile BIT, then the bifurcation clause in that treaty applies. SITS has appealed before the administrative authorities of Argentina and stated that SITS reserved the right to pursue arbitration in due time. Furthermore, if the Tribunal would find that the MFN clause does not apply, then, Argentina argues, the Tribunal could not find that it has jurisdiction under the Treaty because Article 10(2) requires that 18 months have elapsed since the initiation of the judicial process. According to Argentina, the Treaty refers here to the ordinary judicial process. This expression does not include the administrative courts. Under said Article 10(2), Argentina argues, the claim has to be pursued in a diligent and effective manner in the \"competent judicial courts\".92\n\nIbid. para. 275.\n\n112.\n\nA different situation prevails under the Chile BIT. There the expression \"local jurisdiction\" includes both administrative and judicial jurisdiction. Had the parties to that treaty intended to mean judicial jurisdiction, then the expression \"ordinary judicial procedure\" would have been used. The term jurisdiction needs to be interpreted to give full meaning to the different provisions of the Chile BIT where it occurs. This would not be the case if the expression \"local jurisdiction\" is restricted to mean \"ordinary judicial procedure\".93\n\nFurthermore, under international law, jurisdiction denotes the legislative, judicial and administrative competence of the State. It is in the customary language of international law to include the administrative and judicial jurisdictions under the expression \"local jurisdiction\".94\n\nIbid, paras. 276-281.\n\nIbid. para. 276.\n\n113.\n\nThis interpretation is also confirmed by the text of Article 10(2) of the Chile BIT.\n\nThis article offers the option of international arbitration as opposed to the local jurisdiction. The investor may pursue either option. In this context, the reference to local jurisdiction necessarily includes the administrative courts. Argentina recalls that \"the protection of the private rights of individuals is formally dealt with by means of administrative and judicial procedural techniques, and that in certain circumstances, the administrative claim is an essential requirement in order for the judicial appeal to proceed.\"95\n\nIbid. para. 286.\n\n114.\n\nArgentina refers also to the preparatory work for the Chile BIT. Argentina recalls a communication from the Chilean Foreign Office to the Argentine counterpart saying that if the discussions between investor and State do not succeed, then \"the dispute may be submitted to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction\". The final text included a generic term, local jurisdiction, but the intention of the parties is clear. This understanding is confirmed when the structure of both documents is compared. Argentina maintains that, since one treaty is based on the other, \"it can be presupposed that the consequence of using a broad wording (such *as local jurisdiction)* or a specific wording (such as *competent courts or judicial procedure)* was clear to the subscribing parties.\"96\n\nIbid, paras. 288-290.\n\n115.\n\nArgentina concludes the reasoning of this objection by affirming that \"Siemens refers to SITS as an *alter ego* and as a simple vehicle of its will in order to subscribe and perform the Contract. Thus, either the proceedings prosecuted by SITS are imputable to Siemens, or Siemens is not entitled to bring claims on behalf of SITS, that does not qualify either as an investor or as an investment pursuant to the Treaty.\"97\n\nIbid. para. 292.\n\n***(b) Position of the Claimant***\n----------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nSiemens denies that the MFN clause requires it to choose between two alternative treaties and that once an advantage under a treaty is chosen then all the provisions of that treaty apply. Each treaty may carry advantages and disadvantages, and the MFN clause \"implies the right to select those aspects of provisions in different treaties that favor the MFNC\u2019s beneficiary most.\"98 Siemens refers in this respect to the Commentary of the ILC on the Draft Articles, which states that \"whenever the beneficiary State is accorded different types of treatment with respect to the same subject-matter, it shall be entitled to whichever treatment or combination of treatments it prefers in any particular case.\"99\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 242.\n\nIbid. para. 245. Quoted by the Claimant with emphasis added by the Claimant.\n\n117.\n\nSiemens argues that, even if the position of Argentina were correct as to the effect of applying the MFN clause, Siemens has not triggered the fork-in-the-road provision of the Chile BIT. Siemens asserts that, for this provision to apply, there must be a submission to a national jurisdiction, the dispute so submitted must be identical to that submitted to arbitration, and the parties to both proceedings must also be identical. This is not the case here. First, no submission has been made before a \"national jurisdiction\". This term, according to Siemens, makes \"reference to bodies that are both independent and impartial, as far as the parties to the dispute are concerned, and which - pursuant to the host State legal system - are empowered to settle investment disputes between the State and foreign investors.\"100 This term does not include administrative proceedings before the Executive Branch, but only proceedings before \"the internal bodies of the host state exercising judicial type functions (funciones jurisdiccionales), as opposed to those performing administrative or law-making ones.\"101 SITS\u2019 submissions were made to the Argentine President. He was asked to reconsider a decision he had adopted. SITS\u2019 filings before the Argentine President were not part of a judicial proceeding. The President exercised an administrative, not a judicial, function. In deciding the administrative appeal filed by SITS, he was just exercising his administrative function.102\n\nIbid. para. 251.\n\nIbid. para. 254.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 267.\n\n***(c) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe allegations of the parties raise two issues: (i) whether by claiming a benefit through the MFN clause all provisions of the treaty providing for that benefit then apply; and (ii) whether there is a difference between the terms \"local jurisdiction\" and \"ordinary jurisdiction\" used in the Chile BIT and the Treaty, respectively, for purposes of applying the fork-in-the-road clause under the Chile BIT or the requirement to submit a dispute first to the local courts under the Treaty.\n\n119.\n\nOn the first issue, the argument of Argentina is prompted by the wide scope given by Siemens in its allegations to the MFN clause in the Treaty. If the MFN clause is interpreted to have such coverage, then it should cover the Chile BIT as a whole and not only the provisions convenient to the Claimant. The party claiming a benefit under the clause would choose between one treaty as a whole and the other, including the application of clauses that may be considered less beneficial.\n\n120.\n\nThis understanding of the operation of the MFN clause would defeat the intended result of the clause which is to harmonize benefits agreed with a party with those considered more favorable granted to another party. It would oblige the party claiming a benefit under a treaty to consider the advantages and disadvantages of that treaty as a whole rather than just the benefits. The Tribunal recognizes that there may be merit in the proposition that, since a treaty has been negotiated as a package, for other parties to benefit from it, they also should be subject to its disadvantages. The disadvantages may have been a trade-off for the claimed advantages. However, this is not the meaning of an MFN clause. As its own name indicates, it relates only to more favorable treatment. There is also no correlation between the generality of the application of a particular clause and the generality of benefits and disadvantages that the treaty concerned may include. Even if the MFN clause is of a general nature, its application will be related only to the benefits that the treaty of reference may grant and to the extent that benefits are perceived to be such. As already noted, there may be public policy considerations that limit the benefits that may be claimed by the operation of an MFN clause, but those pleaded by the Respondent have not been considered by the Tribunal to be applicable in this case.\n\n121.\n\nOn the first issue, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant may limit the application of the Chile BIT to direct access to international arbitration. Therefore, there is no further need to consider the allegations of the parties on the fork-in-the-road provision of the Chile BIT or the nature of the jurisdictions referred to in the Treaty and the Chile BIT.\n\n**4. Third and Fourth Objections: Siemens Lacks** ***ius standi***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe parties\u2019 allegations on *ius standi* have extended in part to the issue of whether the dispute arises directly out of an investment under the Fifth Objection. To avoid repetition, the Tribunal will consider all issues related to *ius standi* under this section irrespective of the heading under which they have been raised.\n\n***(a) Position of the Respondent***\n------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Treaty requires a direct relationship between the investor and the investment. In the instant case, this direct relationship does not exist because SNI and not Siemens is the holder of the shares in SITS. It follows that only SNI could raise claims in relation to its investment and SNI is not party to these proceedings.103 According to Argentina, this understanding is reaffirmed by \"the application of a criterion so strong as the *effective* seat when assigning nationality to legal persons.\"104\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 294-295.\n\nIbid. para. 293.\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent recognizes that there is the possibility of indirect claims under Article 4 of the Treaty and the related Ad Article 4 of the Protocol.105 This specific possibility under Article 4 shows the exceptional nature of indirect claims. It confirms that they cannot be implied but require an express provision in the agreement and the Chile BIT does not permit indirect claims. Therefore, if the Tribunal should find the Chile BIT applicable, Siemens could not bring an indirect claim at all by the operation of the MFN clause: \"[I]f Siemens expects to make use of the treatment accorded to Chilean investments and Chilean investors for considering it most favorable, then Siemens should be placed in the same position as a Chilean investment or a Chilean investor. Otherwise, Siemens and its investment would be accorded a most favorable treatment than [sic] that accorded to Chilean investors and investments, which is contrary to the operation of the MNFC.\"106 Argentina argues that investors cannot pick and choose provisions of each treaty and cut a new treaty to the measure of their interests. MFN clauses \"do not serve to create a super investment treaty that includes the main benefits of each different treaty.\"107\n\nAd Article 4 of the Protocol reads as follows: \"A claim to compensation shall also exist when any of the measures defined in Article 4 is taken in respect of the company in which the investment is made and as a result the investment is severely impaired.\" (Translation of the Tribunal).\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 306.\n\nIbid. para. 308.\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent recognizes that \"It is clear that an investor in shares has standing to activate dispute settlement mechanisms under bilateral investment treaties in cases of acts by the host state that affect it directly.\" The situation is different when shareholders bring a claim for damages suffered by the company in which they have shares (indirect claims). The shareholders and the company have distinct legal personality. In these cases, the possibility for the shareholders to file indirect claims is always based on an express authorization. These principles are reflected in the judgments of the ICJ in *Barcelona Traction* and *ELSI.* ICSID decisions have not modified this rule since the claims were brought personally and directly *(Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain),* the local corporation qualified as an investment *(AMT v. Zaire),* or the applicable treaty permitted an indirect claim *(AAPL v. Sri Lanka),108*\n\nIbid, paras. 297-299.\n\n126.\n\nThe Respondent contests the notion of direct claim under the Treaty advanced by the Claimant: \"[A] claim is direct if it originates at [sic] an injury caused directly to a right of whoever files a claim. A claim is indirect if it relates to a measure affecting the assets or rights of a third party (in this case SITS) and indirectly affects the expectations of whoever claims (shareholder), who is not the holder of such assets or rights.\"109\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 142.\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes the Claimant\u2019s allegations as a \"gathering of opinions and decisions which does not distinguish, *inter alia,* whether a treaty existed expressly allowing a claim by the shareholder, or whether such company qualified as investment or investor in the light of the applicable treaty, or whether it was a question of direct or indirect claims.\"110\n\nIbid. para. 154.\n\n***(b) Position of the Claimant***\n----------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nSiemens refutes the notion that such a direct relationship is required by the Treaty. There is no reference in the Treaty to a direct relationship between the investor and the investment as a requirement to entitle it to protection. The broad formula used in Article 1 (1) to define investment \"could only be limited by express exceptions or limitations set out in the Treaty itself [...] had the parties intended to exclude certain assets from the Treaty\u2019s scope of application, they would have done so.\"111 Siemens refers to three approaches to the definition of investment. The Treaty uses the most general definition, the asset-based approach, as opposed to the enterprise-based or transaction-based approaches. The Contracting Parties in adopting this approach \"did not intend to require direct ownership of the assets covered by the definition; this conclusion is supported by the absence of any exclusion expressly set forth in the Treaty in order to limit the typical broad reference involved in the asset-based definition.\"112\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 308-309.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 186.\n\n129.\n\nSiemens also contests the validity of Argentina\u2019s assertion that the use of the effective seat of the investor to determine nationality is evidence of the requirement of a direct relationship between the investor and the investment. Nationality by corporate seat is one of the accepted criteria for determining corporate nationality. Such criterion has no effect on the status of Siemens as an investor. Siemens finds that \"in the light of the broad definition of the terms [sic] \u2018investment\u2019 set out in the Treaty as well as the ICSID Convention and its interpretation as reflected in the ICSID practice and the opinion of distinguished legal authors, the only interpretation sustainable is that the Treaty does cover indirect investment as the one made by Siemens in this case.\"113\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 322.\n\n130.\n\nSiemens maintains that it has standing irrespective of SNI\u2019s right to enjoy the protection of the Treaty. Siemens is not precluded from pursuing its claim under the Treaty due to the fact that the shares in SITS are held through SNI. Siemens has submitted its claim in its own right.114\n\nIbid, paras. 323-331.\n\n131.\n\nAs regards the standing of Siemens from an international law point of view, Siemens alleges that *Barcelona Traction* has been misconstrued by the Respondent. In that case, the issue was not whether international law provided an independent source of rights and protections for shareholders; rather the question was whether a State could protect its shareholders in a foreign corporation affected by measures of a third State. This distinction, according to Siemens, is \"fundamental because the international law question addressed by the ICJ was not whether shareholders had a cause of action under international law.\"115 In the present case, the Treaty grants standing to the shareholders and the ICJ held that foreign shareholders are protected by international law if the company is a national of the respondent state. In fact, this is the case of SITS. Furthermore, the ICJ in *Barcelona Traction* referred to treaty developments in foreign investment protection by which \"Sometimes companies are themselves vested with a direct right to defend their interests against States through prescribed procedures. No such instrument is in force between the Parties to the present case.\"116 In *ELSI* \"the ICJ did not even address the question of whether the substantive provisions of the treaty [...] granted protection to the U.S. shareholders in relation to acts of the Italian authorities aimed at the company. By examining the merits of the claims, the ICJ clearly considered that the treaty protected the shareholders.\"117\n\nIbid. para. 352.\n\nIbid. para. 358, quoted by Claimant.\n\nIbid. para. 359.\n\n132.\n\nSiemens reviews the practice of arbitral tribunals established under BITs and concludes that \"[they] have consistently granted standing to foreign investors holding shares in locally incorporated companies. In all these cases, adverse measures by the host State that have affected the local company, were found as giving foreign shareholders in these companies a direct right of action.\"118 Siemens considers also that the practice of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal does not support the position of Argentina, contrary to what has been alleged by Argentina. Article VII(2) of the Claims Settlement Declaration provides the criteria for determining whether a particular investment belongs to a protected investor and it does not \"preclude a shareholder in a local company, injured by host-state measures, from bringing a claim in relation to its shareholding. Article VII(2) merely determines whether that shareholding may be said to belong to a protected investor.\"119 According to Siemens, the case law of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal confirms this understanding as evidenced in *American International Group, Inc. (AIG) v. Iran* and *Ebrahimi v. Iran.120*\n\nIbid. para. 381.\n\nIbid. para. 382.\n\nLegal Authority No. 85 submitted with Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n133.\n\nSiemens also argues that the wording of the Treaty does not support the position of Argentina. The Preamble is clear in that the purpose of the Treaty is to create favorable conditions for investments and the definition of this term is very broad and covers every kind of assets. The Ad Article 4 of the Protocol by referring to \"shall also exist\" indicates that it is not exclusive and that \"this provision cannot be construed to mean that rights protected by other Articles of the Treaty enjoyed by the investor by virtue of its investment in the local company are excluded.\"121 Siemens concludes that \"Argentina\u2019s attempt to deny the advantages of the Treaty to foreign investors in local companies by relying on the corporate personality of those companies is at odds with the Treaty.\"122\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 391.\n\nIbid. para. 392.\n\n134.\n\nSiemens also contests the effect attributed by the Respondent to the claim of a benefit under the MFN clause in respect of Ad Article 4 of the Protocol. The fact that indirect claims are mentioned in that Article and not in the Chile BIT does not mean that Siemens has to abide by all the provisions of the Chile BIT. Siemens is not bound by a less favorable provision of the Chile BIT. To argue otherwise, contradicts the intent of the MFN clause.123\n\nIbid. para. 400.\n\n***(c) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that the claim of favorable treatment under a provision of the Chile BIT does not necessarily entail being subject to all provisions of the Chile BIT, including those that the Claimant may consider less advantageous. Therefore, for purposes of consideration of this objection, the question of whether the Chile BIT only covers direct investments is of no relevance.\n\n136.\n\nThe arguments of the Respondent against protection of indirect investments are based on the extraordinary nature of such protection requiring specific coverage in the Treaty, on the fact that there is such specific reference only in Article 4 and on the criterion defining the nationality of a company by its seat. The arguments on indirect investments revolve around two different meanings of indirect: indirect meaning that the shareholder of the local company controls it through another company, and indirect meaning that a shareholder may claim damage suffered by a company in which it holds shares. These two distinct situations appear intertwined in the parties\u2019 arguments. The Tribunal will consider first the arguments related to indirect investment understood as an investment by an investor through interposed companies.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal has conducted a detailed analysis of the references in the Treaty to \"investment\" and \"investor\". The Tribunal observes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect investment as such in the Treaty. The definition of \"investment\" is very broad. An investment is any kind of asset considered to be such under the law of the Contracting Party where the investment has been made. The specific categories of investment included in the definition are included as examples rather than with the purpose of excluding those not listed. The drafters were careful to use the words \"not exclusively\" before listing the categories of \"particularly\" included investments. One of the categories consists of \"shares, rights of participation in companies and other types of participation in companies\".124 The plain meaning of this provision is that shares held by a German shareholder are protected under the Treaty. The Treaty does not require that there be no interposed companies between the investment and the ultimate owner of the company. Therefore, a literal reading of the Treaty does not support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments.\n\nArticle 1(1) b).\n\n138.\n\nThe arguments related to Ad Article 4 of the Protocol refer to indirect claims by a shareholder based on damage to the company in which it holds shares. It will be useful to reproduce this provision here. It reads as follows: \"The right to be compensated also exists when measures defined in Article 4 are adopted in respect of a company where the investment has been made and as a result of such measures the investment is severely prejudiced.\" The term \"measures\" in Article 4 of the Treaty is used only in the context of expropriation or measures tantamount to expropriation. This Article and the addition in the Protocol read together indicate that the right to be compensated is based on damage suffered by the investment directly, or indirectly through \"measures\" taken against the company. It is not sufficient for the company in which the investment has been made to suffer damage. This damage has to have a detrimental effect on the investment. This effect is the cause of the State\u2019s responsibility under the Treaty.\n\n139.\n\nArgentina considers this provision to be indicative of the special nature of indirect claims and that, for them to be possible, they have to be specifically authorized. Siemens reads the use of \"also\" in connection with the right of compensation to mean that this is yet another indication that this right is not limited to this situation. The Tribunal considers that this clause focuses on damage to the investment directly, or indirectly through measures taken against the company in which the investment has been made, rather than on who may base a claim on it. The provision speaks of a right to compensation, without specifying who may claim such a right, whether directly or indirectly. The use of \"also\" should be read in the same light. It is established in the Treaty that the right to be compensated exists in case of expropriation and measures having the equivalent effect, and \"also\" in the case of measures directed against the company in which the investment has been made. Therefore, in the opinion of the Tribunal, the arguments related to indirect claims based on these provisions are misplaced.\n\n140.\n\nIt follows from this conclusion that there is no merit in the allegation that the provision for indirect claims in Article 4 and the corresponding provision of the Protocol are an indication that such claims are not permitted under other provisions of the Treaty. In this respect, the Tribunal also notes that Article 4 is the only article in the Treaty that deals with compensation in case of expropriation and of war or civil unrest. If the Treaty should be interpreted as alleged by Argentina - by excluding from its application every specific situation that has not been included -, we would be bound to reach the conclusion that, in cases of discrimination, arbitrary measures, or treatment short of the just and equitable standard, there would not be a right to compensation under the Treaty - an unlikely intended result by the Contracting Parties given the Treaty\u2019s purpose. If a matter is dealt with in a provision of the Treaty and not specifically mentioned under other provisions, it does not necessarily follow that the other provisions should be considered to exclude the matter especially covered.\n\n141.\n\nThe parties have also referred to the case law of the ICJ and ICSID tribunals related to indirect claims and the extent to which they are permissible. The parties have widely different interpretations of the significance of *Barcelona Traction* and *ELSI* regarding the extent of the right of a State under public international law to grant diplomatic protection to nationals who are shareholders in foreign companies. The Tribunal considers it unnecessary to discuss the relevance of these cases to the current proceedings. The issues before this Tribunal concern not diplomatic protection under customary international law but the rights of investors, including shareholders, as determined by the Treaty.\n\n142.\n\nAs regards ICSID case law dealing with the issue of the right of shareholders to bring a claim before an arbitral tribunal, the decisions of arbitral tribunals have been consistent in deciding in favor of such right of shareholders. The Tribunal does not agree with the arguments advanced by Argentina to the effect that these cases do not support the Claimant\u2019s contentions because the claims were brought personally and directly *(Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain),* the local corporation qualified as an investment *(AMT v. Zaire),* or the applicable treaty permitted an indirect claim *(AAPL v. Sri Lanka).* In all these cases, whether involving individual shareholders or corporate shareholders, the arbitral tribunals recognized their *ius standi.* The fact that the shareholders were individuals does not make them qualitatively different from Siemens. The arguments of Argentina are also based on the issue of indirect investment which the Tribunal has already rejected.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal considers further that the Respondent has failed to establish that the effective seat criterion for determining nationality of a company limits the possibility of advancing indirect claims under the Treaty. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the two matters are unrelated. If indirect claims are permitted, those would be permitted irrespective of the criterion chosen in the Treaty to determine the nationality of investors.\n\n144.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal considers that Siemens has *ius standi* in these proceedings as an investor in SITS through SNI.\n\n**5. Fifth Objection: The Dispute Does Not Arise Directly Out of an Investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Position of the Respondent***\n------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nArgentina argues that, as evidenced by the preparatory works of the Convention, it was the intention to interpret restrictively the disputes that could be brought under the Convention and the term \"directly\" was included instead of others that would have been less restrictive, such as \"in relation to\" or \"arising out of\u2019 an investment. Siemens\u2019 investment consists of shares in SNI or, if identity of SNI and Siemens is assumed, of shares in SITS, an Argentine company. The dispute is related to acts of the Federal Government in respect of the Contract, it arises out of SITS\u2019s contractual rights and obligations, and SITS is not an investor nor an investment under the terms of the Treaty.125\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 309-313.\n\n146.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"it can be simultaneously and concordantly stated that: i) the dispute brought by Siemens arises directly out of assets which do not constitute an investment of Siemens and ii) the dispute brought by Siemens does not arise directly out of an investment in shares of stock in SITS.\"126 The Respondent develops this argument further in its Reply on Jurisdiction. The Respondent recognizes as a possible investment only the shares held in SITS by SNI who, inexplicably, is not part in this proceeding. SITS itself and the Contract are not investments and the dispute concerns issues related to the Contract, not the shares of SITS. Argentina has not expropriated these shares. According to Argentina, the legal dispute does not arise directly from an investment in shares by Siemens since it concerns the effects of measures taken by the Respondent in relation to an asset that is not an investment: the legal dispute arises indirectly from an alleged investment in shares.127\n\nIbid. para. 315.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, paras. 160-172.\n\n***(b) Position of the Claimant***\n----------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nSiemens recalls that SNI became fully integrated into Siemens in 1992. The consequence of integration under German Law is close to a merger in which the integrated company preserves its legal personality but loses its independence: SNI\u2019s Managing Board has the obligation to implement the directives of Siemens, Siemens has access to SNI\u2019s assets, and Siemens is jointly and severally liable for SNI\u2019s liabilities incurred prior to and during the integration. In fact, SNI is just a business unit of Siemens.128\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 334-335.\n\n148.\n\nSiemens argues that it is not claiming SITS\u2019 rights, but rather Siemens\u2019 rights, under the Treaty. Siemens\u2019 claim is not indirect but a direct action under the Treaty \"based on Argentina\u2019s multiple breaches of the guarantees and protection granted to German investors in the Treaty.\"129 Siemens\u2019 direct right of action is \"independent of and distinct from any contractual right of action that SITS may have under the Contract or Argentine law.\"130 Argentine civil and company law are irrelevant for purposes of Siemens\u2019 rights under the Treaty.\n\nIbid. para. 340.\n\nIbid. para. 241.\n\n149.\n\nSiemens points out that the objection of Argentina has nothing to do with the requirement of Article 25(1) that the dispute should arise directly out of an investment. Since Argentina denies that Siemens has made an investment in that country for purposes of the Treaty, then clearly there can be no dispute arising out of the investment. In fact, Argentina confuses the direct requirement of Article 25(1) with the issue of direct/indirect claims and persists in identifying Siemens\u2019 rights and claims arising directly from the Treaty with SITS\u2019 rights and possible claims under the Contract and Argentina law.131\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 231-235.\n\n***(c) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nAs described by Siemens, its investment consists of: \"shares, rights of participation in companies and other types of participation\", \"claims to money that has been used to create economic value or claims to any performance under a contract having an economic value\", \"intellectual property rights\", and \"business concessions conferred by public law.\" There is no doubt that the dispute with Argentina under the Treaty is a dispute which arises directly from the investment as defined by Siemens. The quality of a direct dispute is not affected by Siemens not being the direct shareholder of the local company. This is a separate question. For purposes of Article 25(1), a dispute may arise directly out of an investment made directly or indirectly by an investor. Whether in that situation the investor qualifies as such will depend on the definition of investor in the treaty or the terms of the investment contract. The direct requirement under the ICSID Convention is related to the investment dispute, not to whether the investor is direct or indirect.\n\n**6. Sixth Objection: The Dispute is Hypothetical**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Position of the Respondent***\n------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Treaty requires that a dispute exist at the time of notification to it for purposes of arbitration. There must be continuity between the dispute brought by the investor and the dispute that was subject to negotiations during the amicable phase and afterwards brought before the local courts. In this case, Argentina argues Siemens notified the dispute while SITS filed appeals against the measures taken by the State. This is disconcerting for the Respondent because if SITS succeeded in its administrative appeal, \"the expropriation claim made no sense\"132. Hence, the hypothetical character of the dispute: it may have happened that the expropriation measure had been revoked based on SITS\u2019 own jurisdictional activity.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 324.\n\n152.\n\nFurthermore, Argentina recalls that it has always acknowledged that SITS has a right to compensation due to the termination of the Contract. Therefore, it was impossible that the dispute had arisen when the Claimant filed its notification, July 23, 2001. The existence of the dispute depended on facts that might or might not occur and did not depend solely on the Respondent\u2019s will: Argentina required the collaboration of the Claimant for purposes of the valuation. Siemens never filed a real dispute founded on a violation of Article 4 of the Treaty on grounds of \"an unjustified delay by the Federal State to determine the compensation owed to SITS, or in its case, because the compensation amount offered *severely impaired the investment\"133.*\n\nIbid. para. 329. Emphasis in the original.\n\n153.\n\nArgentina also argues that an expropriation cannot be consolidated during the arbitration proceedings: \"[T]there has to be a fundamental dispossession of the use and enjoyment of a definite investment without compensation at the moment the claim is placed.\"134 Argentina warns of a proliferation of \"just in case\" claims should claims based on immature controversies be allowed to proceed.135\n\nReply on jurisdiction, para. 175.\n\nIbid. para. 176.\n\n***(b) Position of Claimant***\n------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nSiemens argues that the dispute is concrete in the light of Siemens\u2019 own rights under the Treaty and its violation by Argentina. Argentina took a series of measures over a period of two years that amounted to creeping expropriation and failure to meet the obligations under the Treaty to accord Siemens\u2019 investment fair and equitable treatment and guarantee its full protection and legal security, to avoid any arbitrary and discriminatory treatment, and to comply with the obligations specifically undertaken towards the investment. Siemens\u2019 claims go beyond a claim of expropriation for termination of the Contract without compensation.136 Furthermore, for purposes of jurisdiction, the relevant date is the date of institution of the proceedings, in this case July 17, 2002, when the dispute was registered, and not July 23, 2001 as maintained by Argentina.137 On that date, July 17, 2002, the dispute was \"real and in force\".138\n\nCounter-Memorial on jurisdiction, paras. 429-430 and Rejoinder on jurisdiction, para. 240.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 433.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 240 (i).\n\n155.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the real nature of the dispute under the Treaty was recognized by the Respondent when the parties considered the possibility of submitting the dispute jointly to ICSID and limiting it to the amount of damages. The conduct of Argentina towards Siemens confirms that a concrete and relevant dispute exists. Siemens also affirms that the administrative appeal of SITS did not request a declaration that the Contract was still in force and effect but \"to establish that its termination was due to Argentina\u2019s fault and, accordingly, that SITS\u2019 compensation should be full rather than limited, as suggested by the Government.\"139 The denial by Argentina that Siemens has a right to compensation under the Treaty is another instance that evidences the existence of a concrete dispute.140\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 443.\n\nIbid. para. 445\n\n156.\n\nAnother flaw in Argentina\u2019s objection is the timing regarding the issue of compensation. This is premature and not valid as an exception to jurisdiction. It should be raised in the proceedings on the merits. The Treaty requires that compensation be paid without delay and Argentina does not claim to have taken any steps in this regard. Furthermore, Siemens\u2019 claims cannot be reduced to compensation and the recognition of an obligation of compensation is not sufficient to terminate the dispute as recognized in *AGIP v. Congo.141*\n\nIbid, paras. 446-448.\n\n157.\n\nSiemens concludes its rebuttal of this objection by stating that \"The present dispute -which comprises an expropriation claim, and other violations of the Treaty, has existed from the moment Argentina deprived Siemens of the economic benefits of its investments and violated the guarantees and protections granted to Siemens and its investment under the Treaty. Those effects took place before notice of the dispute was delivered by Siemens to Argentina through its letter dated July 23, 2001.\"142 Siemens re-affirms that its claims arise directly from its rights under the Treaty and that \"Argentina\u2019s assertions concerning SITS\u2019 compensation and the internal proceedings in relation to it are misplaced and irrelevant to jurisdiction in this case.\"143\n\nIbid. para. 454.\n\nIbid. para. 455.\n\n***(c) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal needs to consider whether a real, as opposed to a hypothetical, dispute exists and, for purposes of jurisdiction, which is the critical date for determining its existence. The exchanges between the parties in this connection also have raised issues about the nature of the dispute, compensation, and the lack of continuity between the dispute as described in the notification of the dispute and the claims made in these proceedings. The first two of these issues are related to the merits of the dispute and the Tribunal does not need to address them for purposes of determining whether it has jurisdiction in this case. The third issue is the subject of the seventh objection to jurisdiction and will be dealt with later by the Tribunal.\n\n159.\n\nFor a dispute to exist, according to the ICJ, there must be \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between the parties.\"144 In *AAPL v. Sri Lanka,* the arbitral tribunal considered it sufficient for a dispute to exist that there be a lack of response to a specific demand after a reasonable period of time.145 In the instant case, the supposed hypothetical nature of the dispute is related to the fact that SITS filed administrative appeals against Decree 669/01 and Siemens notified Argentina of the dispute under the Treaty on July 23, 2001 before the appeals had been decided. According to Argentina, if SITS would have been compensated for the cancellation of the Contract, then there would have been no grounds for a claim before ICSID. At the time, it was premature to know what would be the result of the administrative proceedings.\n\n*Case concerning East Timor,* 1995 ICJ Reports, p. 89.\n\nAward, June 27, 1990, 4 ICSID Reports 251.\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this issue is of a historical nature. The administrative appeals were rejected shortly after the notification of the dispute by Decree 1205/01, which confirmed Decree 669/01 on September 24, 2001. As Siemens has framed its claim, the claim goes beyond expropriation measures and it is a claim under the Treaty by a party different from the party that instituted the proceedings in Argentina. There are certainly conflicting interests between the parties, and opposed legal views on the significance of certain facts and on whether the dispute is a dispute of a contractual nature or a dispute under the Treaty. The Tribunal is satisfied that a real dispute exists.\n\n161.\n\nConcerning the critical date to determine whether a dispute exists, the Tribunal considers that for purposes of the Treaty the dispute must exist at the time of the notice of arbitration. It has to exist also at the time the dispute is filed with the ICSID Secretariat and at the time of registration. The Tribunal has examined the correspondence between the Claimant and the Respondent between July 12, 2001, date of the communication of the Claimant to the Respondent to start amicable consultations for purposes of Article 10(1) of the Treaty, and March 18, 2002, date of the notice of the Claimant to the Respondent concerning its consent to arbitration. It is evident from this correspondence that a dispute existed at the time and that the parties even considered to submit it jointly to arbitration. Although this period of time overlaps in part with the appeals made by SITS to the President, this fact was never alleged by the Respondent as an obstacle to the consultations under Article 10(1) of the Treaty.\n\n162.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal rejects the sixth objection to its jurisdiction.\n\n**7. Seventh Objection: Dispute Has Never Been Notified**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Position of the Respondent***\n------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nAccording to Argentina, Siemens has included in its Memorial claims going beyond those included in the notification to Argentina about the existence of a dispute or in the arbitration request. The Respondent argues that \"Siemens tries to allege the existence of a *creeping expropriation* and to include additional claims as part of a supposed *expropriatory process.* In order to increase, in this way, the calculation basis of the compensation it claims.\"146 The only admissible claim is the claim based on the rescission of the Contract.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 335.\n\n164.\n\nArgentina considers that \"there was neither a controversy in connection with clearly identified problems, nor a precise claim - as required in re Maffezini v. Spain -, until Siemens filed its Memorial, at least, in relation to all those matters that are beyond the allegation stating that the termination of the Contract by the Federal State amounts to an expropriation without just compensation, in violation of section 4 of the Treaty.\"147 It follows that the six-month term requirement to settle the dispute amicably before filing an arbitration request has not been met.\n\nIbid. para. 339.\n\n165.\n\nArgentina also points out that there was no additional arbitration request regarding these claims and no registration of the additional issues as required by Article 36 of the Convention, thus depriving the ICSID Secretary-General of the opportunity to consider these claims for registration purposes.148\n\nIbid. para. 340.\n\n***(b) Position of the Claimant***\n----------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nSiemens argues that there is no inconsistency between the dispute notified to Argentina and the subject matter of the Request for Arbitration and the Claimant\u2019s Memorial. The Treaty does not contain any formal notification requirement: \"Under Article 10 of the Treaty, what matters [...] is whether the communications before the institution of proceedings concerned \u2018the dispute\u2019 that was subsequently submitted to arbitration.\"149 Siemens described the main aspects of the dispute in the note filed on July 23, 2001 and, in the Request for Arbitration, listed the measures that constituted multiple breaches of the Treaty. Siemens manifests that in both documents it is expressly stated that the claim was not exclusively limited to the factual or legal arguments set out in them.150\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 461.\n\nIbid. para. 463.\n\n167.\n\nThe six-month period, even if certain matters had not been negotiated, is a procedural and not a jurisdictional matter: \"Arbitration practice demonstrates that waiting periods are procedural rather than jurisdictional and need not to be observed if negotiations are obviously futile.\"151 Argentina never evidenced a serious effort to negotiate a settlement and the invitation to negotiate was always there. Siemens considers that \"the fact that in its Memorial on Jurisdiction Argentina rejects in advance Siemens\u2019 claims involved in this dispute evidences once more its lack of interest to settle the dispute. Thus, insistence on a separate waiting period for events allegedly not included in Siemens\u2019 prior submissions could only lead to the illogical result of forcing the Claimant to go through a futile procedure and ultimately to re-submit to arbitration exactly the same claim.\"152\n\nIbid. para. 466.\n\nIbid. para. 469.\n\n168.\n\nSiemens argues that all measures are part of a chain of events that ended in the unilateral termination of the Contract by Argentina and the expropriation of Siemens\u2019 investment. They form a single dispute: \"There can be no doubt that all issues submitted by Siemens in its Memorial relate to the same dispute notified to Argentina and that was the object of the Request for Arbitration, and are thus properly before the Tribunal.\"153 All these issues relate to \"the same subject matter, the same factual background and the same causes of action.\"154 Furthermore, Siemens affirms its right to elaborate in its Memorial on the issues in dispute and even to submit \"additional claims\" until the Reply was due to be filed, as permitted by Article 46 of the Convention and Rule 40 of the Arbitration Rules.155\n\nIbid. para. 472.\n\nIbid. para. 479.\n\nIbid, paras. 480-486.\n\n169.\n\nAccording to Siemens, the facts described in the Memorial are \"part of a one and the same story: the continuing spectrum of Argentina\u2019s interference with the DNI Project and the investment environment originally created to secure the development of said project.\"156 The legal claims are also the same: \"The nature of the dispute is determined not by the facts leading to it but by the legal claims they trigger.\"157\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 255.\n\nIbid. para. 256, the quote by the Claimant is from C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention.*\n\n***(c) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nAs characterized by the Claimant in its letter of July 12, 2001 (filed on July 23, 2001) to the President of the Argentine Republic, the dispute concerns the breach by Argentina of its obligation under the Treaty to grant Siemens\u2019 investment just and equitable treatment, and full protection and legal security in Argentina, not to take arbitrary or discriminatory measures that affect Siemens\u2019 administration, use and benefit of its investment, and not to expropriate or nationalize Siemens\u2019 investment or take equivalent measures against it without prompt payment of the required compensation. These claims, according to the same letter, are based on the actions taken by the Argentine Government after the change of Government in December 1999 that led to the cancellation of the contract on 18 May 2001. Specifically, the Claimant avers that, after the change of Government, it received indications that the new Government wished to modify the Contract and that in February 2000 the authorities stopped the preparation, printing and distribution of the new DNI, alleging without reason problems of a technical nature. Under pressure, Siemens had to initiate negotiations with the Argentine authorities. The negotiations failed because the Argentine authorities did not follow up on their commitments and because the incremental sacrifices requested from the contractor altered significantly the economic-financial equation of the Contract.158\n\nExhibit 16 to the Request for Arbitration, pp. 2-3.\n\n171.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration sets forth in more detail identical claims. The Request lists as acts or omissions of the Respondent the following: (i) measures to press SITS to renegotiate the Contract, (ii) the indefinite suspension of the preparation, printing and distribution of the new DNIs and the implementation of the DNM\u2019s Immigration System, (iii) failure to extend the production of the new DNIs to the whole territory of Argentina, (iv) lack of good faith during the re-negotiation process, (v) unilateral termination of the Contract, (vi) nonpayment of compensation, (vii) lack of reception of the remaining assets and of collaboration by the Government in order to solve the economic, logistic and technical problems arising out of the suspension and unilateral termination of the Contract.159\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 46.\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent has also alleged that \"particularly\" the Claimant\u2019s Memorial brings issues that have never been pursued in compliance with the Treaty.160 Then it proceeds to list a \"series of facts\"161 that substantially coincide with those listed in the Request for Arbitration and reproduced above.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 333.\n\nIbid. para. 334.\n\n173.\n\nComparing the description of facts and legal claims in the letter to the President of the Argentine Republic, the description of facts and legal claims in the Request for Arbitration, and the \"series of facts\" referred to by the Respondent in the Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal fails to perceive any new facts or claims presented by the Respondent that would not have been encompassed by the notice of the existence of a dispute for purposes of the Treaty. The documents concerned are, in this respect, substantially the same, and therefore the Tribunal finds that there is no merit to the seventh objection.\n\n**8. Eighth Objection: The Contract Contains a Specific Jurisdictional Clause**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Position of the Respondent***\n------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Contract provides for the submission to the Federal Administrative and Contentious Courts of Buenos Aires any legal dispute in connection with the Contract. Siemens is submitting to the Tribunal a dispute related to contractual rights of a third party that does not qualify as an investor or as an investment. Siemens is not entitled to bring claims in connection with the Contract to a court other than agreed upon by SITS.162 In addition, the Respondent affirms that the acts of Argentina related to SITS are acts that are based on its contractual rights to rescind a contract rather than on its prerogatives as a sovereign. Breaching the obligations under a contract, or rescinding it, are not the same as expropriating a contract. A State contract may be expropriated only through measures unrelated to the performance of its provisions.163\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 343-344.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 190.\n\n175.\n\nArgentina maintains that even if, for the sake of the argument, such jurisdictional clause would have no effect in a case related to a breach of a BIT, Siemens could not hold Argentina liable under the Treaty because the liability of the host State could only arise out of a denial of justice. The Claimant has not alleged that \"SITS had no access to justice, or that it has been denied to it when attempting to make use of the remedies expressly agreed upon such purposes164.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, para. 345.\n\n176.\n\nArgentina has further argued that the Treaty does not impede the investors from agreeing to different dispute settlement mechanisms, including the renunciation of the remedies offered by the Treaty. These special agreements should take priority over those available under the Treaty. It should be noted that Article 26 of the Convention permits the parties to contract otherwise in relation to the exclusive character of ICSID jurisdiction.165\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, para. 189.\n\n***(b) Position of the Claimant***\n----------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nSiemens argues that the claim brought before this Tribunal is a claim under the Treaty and not under the Contract: \"[T]he characterization of the dispute as arising from a contract or from the BIT, for purposes of jurisdiction, depends on how the claims are put forward by the Claimant. Whether this characterization is correct will ultimately be determined by the tribunal when it decides in its award on the merits whether or not guarantees under the BIT have been violated.\"166\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 492.\n\n178.\n\nSiemens recalls the numerous decisions in which this matter has been decided by ICSID arbitral tribunals in the sense that \"claims alleging a cause of action under a BIT are not precluded by the exclusive jurisdiction of the local courts pursuant to an underlying contract, regardless of whether the claims relate to a greater or lesser extent to contractual issues.\"167 In all cases, tribunals have upheld ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction, and \"irrespective of whether Siemens\u2019 claims raise questions related to the Contract, Siemens is clearly asserting a cause of action under the Treaty. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is not affected by the forum selection clause of the Contract.\"168\n\nIbid. para. 508.\n\nIbid. para. 510.\n\n179.\n\nAs regards the issue of the exclusivity of remedies under Article 26 of the Convention, Siemens maintains that \"if the parties agree on a method of dispute settlement in addition to ICSID, they create an exception to ICSID\u2019s exclusivity but they do not oust ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction in terms of Article 26.\"169\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 293.\n\n***(c) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that Siemens qualifies as an investor and that the dispute arises directly from an investment for purposes of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Treaty and the Convention. The Tribunal concurs with decisions of previous ICSID arbitral tribunals on this matter and in particular recalls the statement made by the *Ad hoc* Annulment Committee in *Vivendi* to the effect that \"A treaty cause of action is not the same as a contractual cause of action; it requires a clear showing of conduct which is in the circumstances contrary to the treaty standard. The availability of local courts ready and able to resolve specific issues [... ] is not dispositive, and it does not preclude an international tribunal from considering the merits of the dispute.\"170 Arbitral tribunals have found that a dispute arising out of a contract may give rise to a claim under a bilateral investment treaty. The dispute as formulated by the Claimant is a dispute under the Treaty. At this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the claims under the Treaty made by Siemens are correct. This is a matter for the merits. The Tribunal simply has to be satisfied that, if the Claimant\u2019s allegations would be proven correct, then the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider them.\n\nLegal Authorities No. 69, submitted with the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 513.\n\n181.\n\nAs regards Article 26 of the Convention, the first sentence reads as follows: \"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.\" This provision presumes exclusivity of the remedies under the Convention unless the parties had agreed otherwise. Article 26 does not provide that what may be agreed otherwise excludes the remedies under Convention. In that case, the remedies under the Convention are not exclusive but neither are those otherwise agreed. This understanding of Article 26 is confirmed by the decision on jurisdiction in *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle Past) Limited (SPP) v. The Arab Republic of Egypt'.* \"Article 26 says that consent to ICSID jurisdiction, unless otherwise stated, shall be deemed to exclude other remedies. Thus failure to waive other remedies does not impair consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\"171\n\n3 *ICSID Reports,* p. 112.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with the Claimant that the issue whether the breach of the Contract may or may not be an act of expropriation is a matter related to the merits of the dispute.\n\n183.\n\nFor the stated reasons, the Tribunal rejects the eighth objection to jurisdiction.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the parties\u2019 arguments in their written and oral pleadings and for the reasons above stated the Tribunal finds that:\n\n1. The Tribunal has jurisdiction of Siemens\u2019 claims as set forth in its Request for Arbitration and its Memorial on the Merits.\n\n2. Siemens has *ius standi* to present the claims referred in 1. above.\n\nThe Tribunal has, accordingly, made the necessary Order under Arbitration Rule 41(4) for the continuation of the procedure.\n\n185.\n\nEach party has requested that the costs of the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings, including its own costs, be borne by the other. The Tribunal further decides to consider this matter as part of the merits."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2007-02-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Separate Opinion by Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro (Award)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2007-01-30T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Separate Opinion by Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro (Award)\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have joined my vote to that of the majority of my arbitration colleagues, with whom I have had the honor to work jointly, being in agreement with the principal conclusions that were reached, acknowledging that the same had been the result of an ample collective deliberation, with the resulting enriching contributions from each one, and the resulting concessions considering the opinions from the rest, which are part of any debate of such a level and category which can easily be appreciated in the award.\n\nHowever, I would like to point out my position in particular with regard to two specific issues and, thus, I find myself obliged to dissent with regard to the exact amount of damages to be paid by the Respondent.\n\nI understand that, in accordance with a request from the Respondent, the Tribunal should have appointed an independent expert in valuations to give its opinion on the above referred to damages.\n\nIt should be noted that the present  case comprises complex valuation and financial issues, which were amply argued and discussed by the parties and their respective experts, with very complicated opinions and data.\n\nIn light of the above, a report from an independent expert is necessary in order to calculate and fully support the amount of damages to be awarded, for all of which I find reasonable the request of its appointment and unjustified its refusal, as such a request never seemed impertinent or untimely to me, but rather reasonable, which acceptance would not have implied any inconveniences.\n\nAlso, with regard to the second issue, I must dissent from the majority, regarding the allocation of the costs of the proceeding. In my humble opinion always also in agreement with prevailing arbitration practice, I consider that the costs of the proceeding should be allocated equally, unless under exceptional circumstances.

Procedural History**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn May 23, 2002, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received from Siemens A.G. (\"Siemens\" or \"Claimant\") a request for arbitration against the Argentine Republic (\"Respondent\", \"Argentina\" or \"Government\"). On June 7, 2002, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the request in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"Institution Rules\") and informed the Claimant that it would not take further action until it had received the prescribed lodging fee as provided by Institution Rule 5(1)(b). On June 13, 2002, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the prescribed lodging fee by the Claimant and transmitted a copy of the request to Argentina and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C. in accordance with Institution Rule 5(2).\n\n2.\n\nAccording to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"the Convention\"), the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the request for arbitration on July 17, 2002. In accordance with Institution Rule 7, the Secretary-General notified the parties on the same date of the registration of the request and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n3.\n\nOn August 7, 2002, the parties agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator to be appointed by each party and the third, who shall serve as the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by the agreement of the parties. The Claimant appointed Judge Charles N. Brower, a U.S. national, and the Respondent appointed Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro, a Spanish national. However, the parties failed to agree on the appointment of the third, presiding arbitrator. On October 21, 2002, the Claimant requested that the third, presiding arbitrator be appointed in accordance with Article 38 of the Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\").\n\n4.\n\nAfter consulting the parties, Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, a national of Spain, was appointed by the Centre as the third, presiding arbitrator. In accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, on December 19, 2002, the Secretary-General notified the parties that all three arbitrators accepted their appointment and that the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal. The Tribunal held its first session with the parties in Washington, D.C. on February 13, 2003.\n\n5.\n\nMr. Guido Santiago Tawil of M. & M. Bomchil and Mr. Peter Gnam of Siemens A.G. represent the Claimant. Messrs. Tawil and Gnam represented the Claimant at the first session. Mr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino, Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, represents the Respondent. Messrs. Ignacio Su\u00e1rez Anzorena and Carlos Lo Turco, acting on instructions from the then Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, and Mr. Osvaldo S\u00edseles, from the Ministerio de Econom\u00eda, represented the Respondent at the first session.\n\n6.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections to any members of the Tribunal. It was also noted that the proceedings would be conducted under the Arbitration Rules in force since September 26, 1984.\n\n7.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties also agreed on several other procedural matters, which were later set forth in the written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. Regarding the written submissions, the Tribunal, after consulting with the parties, fixed the following time limits for the presentation of the parties\u2019 pleadings: The Claimant would file a Memorial within 90 (ninety) days from the date of the first session; the Respondent would file a Counter-Memorial within 90 (ninety) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial; the Claimant would file a Reply within 60 (sixty) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, and the Respondent would file a Rejoinder within 60 (sixty) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Reply.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal further noted that, according to the Arbitration Rules, the Respondent has the right to raise any objections to jurisdiction no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of its Counter-Memorial, and that, in the event that the Respondent would raise objections to jurisdiction, the following schedule would apply: the Claimant would file its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction within the same number of days used by Argentina to file its objections to jurisdiction, but in any event, the Claimant would have a minimum of 60 (sixty) days to file its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction; the Respondent would file its Reply on jurisdiction within 30 (thirty) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction; and the Claimant would file its Rejoinder on jurisdiction within 30 (thirty) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Reply on jurisdiction. It was also agreed that, if the Respondent would raise any objections to jurisdiction and proceedings would be resumed following the filing of such objections (because the Tribunal dismisses the objections or because it decides to join them with the merits of the dispute), the calendar agreed for the merits would recommence, and the Respondent would have the remaining number of days at the date of the filing of its objections to jurisdiction for the filing of its Counter-Memorial on the merits.\n\n9.\n\nOn March 14, 2003, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the merits and accompanying documentation.\n\n10.\n\nOn March 24, 2003, Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, ICSID, Counsel, replaced Mr. Flores as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nOn April 8, 2003, the parties agreed that the hearing on jurisdiction would take place on January 20-22, 2004, in Washington, D.C.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of June 10, 2003, the Argentine Republic requested an extension of time due to the institutional succession in the Argentine Government to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits and/or to raise any objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre until August 4, 2003. By letter of June 18, 2003, the Claimant objected to the extension requested by the Respondent.\n\n13.\n\nOn June 23, 2003, due to the particular circumstances, the Tribunal granted the extension sought by Argentina and informed the parties that if Argentine filed its Counter-Memorial without objecting to jurisdiction, the Claimant, if requested, would be granted a similar extension of time to file its Reply on the merits. The Tribunal further noted that if the Argentine Republic filed any objections to jurisdiction, the Claimant would have the same number of days used by the Argentine Republic to file such objections for the filing of its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction.\n\n14.\n\nOn July 1, 2003, Mr. Horacio Daniel Rosatti informed the Tribunal that he had been appointed Procurador del Tesoro de la Nacion Argentina.\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(1), on August 4, 2003, the Respondent filed a Memorial raising objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. In its Memorial on jurisdiction, Argentina requested the Tribunal for a 45 (forty-five) day extension of the time limit to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits in the event that the Tribunal would declare that it has competence over this matter.\n\n16.\n\nPursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(3), on August 7, 2003, the Tribunal suspended the proceedings on the merits.\n\n17.\n\nAfter inviting the Claimant to present any observations on the time limit extension requested by the Respondent, the Tribunal informed the parties on August 21, 2003, that it was premature to decide on the extension of the time limit to file the Counter-Memorial on the merits requested by Argentina.\n\n18.\n\nOn October 16, 2003, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction. On November 17, 2003, the Respondent filed its Reply on jurisdiction.\n\n19.\n\nOn December 10, 2004, the Respondent requested to postpone the hearing on jurisdiction scheduled for January 20-22, 2004 until February 15, 2004. On December 11, 2004, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to present any observations to the Respondent\u2019s request. On the same date, the Claimant presented its observations asking the Tribunal to reject the Respondent\u2019s request and to maintain the previous agreed schedule for the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n20.\n\nAfter considering the Respondent\u2019s request to postpone the hearing on jurisdiction, the Claimant\u2019s observations thereon, the fact that the development of the proceeding would not be affected due to the brevity of the postponement requested, the availability of the parties, and the agreement of the same to have a two-day hearing, the Tribunal, by letter of December 19, 2003, informed the parties of its decision to schedule the hearing on jurisdiction on February 3 and 4, 2004.\n\n21.\n\nOn December 24, 2003, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on jurisdiction.\n\n22.\n\nAs previously decided by the Tribunal, the hearing on jurisdiction took place in Washington, D.C. on February 3 and 4, 2004. At the hearing, the Claimant was represented by Mr. Guido Santiago Tawil, Mr. Peter Gnam, Mr. Stephan Signer and Ms. Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s Corra. Messrs. Tawil and Gnam addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimant. The Respondent was represented by Ms. Andrea Gualde, Ms. Ana Badillos, and Mr. Jorge Barraguirre from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, as well as by Messrs. Osvaldo S\u00edseles from the Ministerio de Econom\u00eda, and Mr. Roberto Hermida from the Embassy of Argentina in Washington, D.C. Ms. Gualde and Mr. Barraguirre addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Respondent. During the hearing, the Tribunal also questioned to the parties in accordance with Arbitration Rule 32(3).\n\n23.\n\nOn July 2, 2004, the Respondent requested to extend its 45-day extension request to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits to 75 days, in the event that the Tribunal would declare that it had jurisdiction.\n\n24.\n\nOn August 3, 2004, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, which is part of this Award, declaring that the dispute was within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n25.\n\nOn that same date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, establishing the timetable for the continuation of the proceeding, after taking into consideration the reasons expressed by the Respondent in its requests for an extension of the time limit to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits and the observations of the Claimant. The timetable was decided as follows: the Respondent was to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits within 60 (sixty) days, counting from the date of that Procedural Order; the Claimant was to file its Reply within 60 (sixty) days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, and the Respondent was to file its Rejoinder within 60 (sixty) days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Reply. Two alternate dates were set for the hearing on the merits, and the parties were asked to inform the Secretariat on the number of days needed for the hearing.\n\n26.\n\nOn August 10, 2004, both parties requested the hearing on the merits to be held on April 4-15, 2005. Additionally, the Claimant reserved its right to request an extension, if needed, to file its Reply, in the understanding that such an extension should not change the hearing dates already set.\n\n27.\n\nOn August 16, 2004, Argentina notified the appointment of Mr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino as Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina.\n\n28.\n\nOn August 19, 2004, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing on the merits was to be held on April 4-15, 2005, and that, if needed, the Tribunal would additionally be available on April 18-19, 2005. (Later on the parties confirmed to the Tribunal that there would be no need to extend the hearing to April 18-19, 2005).\n\n29.\n\nOn September 24, 2004, Argentina requested an additional extension of 15 (fifteen) days of the time limit to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits due to the recent appointment of Mr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino as Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina. By letter of September 29, 2004, the Claimant objected to the extension requested by the Respondent. After considering the Respondent\u2019s request and the Claimant\u2019s observations, the Tribunal, by letter also of September 29, 2004, granted the 15 day extension requested by the Respondent to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits, on the understanding that a similar extension, if requested, would be granted to the Claimant, and informed the parties that no further extensions would be authorized. The Tribunal also invited the parties to directly exchange their filings in Buenos Aires to avoid further delays.\n\n30.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s decision, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits on October 19, 2004. In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent requested the production of certain documents by the Claimant: (i) forward contract in US dollars (\"dollars or \"$\"), (ii) financial statements of Siemens IT Services, S.A. (\"SITS\") from its commencement of business in Argentina, and (iii) financial statements of Siemens for the same period with respect to the registration of all operations transacted between SITS-Siemens and the rest of the affiliates of the Claimant parent corporation. By letter of December 1, 2004, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would submit, together with its Reply, a copy of SITS\u2019 financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30 of 1997 to 2003 and the Annual Reports of Siemens for the fiscal years ended September 20 of 1997 to 2003.\n\n31.\n\nOn December 1, 2004, the Respondent filed an application to disqualify the President of the Tribunal under Article 57 of the Convention. On December 7, 2004, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 9(6), the two coarbitrators informed the parties that the proceedings were suspended and that the schedule for the parties\u2019 submissions and the date for the hearing on the merits were to be maintained.\n\n32.\n\nOn December 14, 2004, the Claimant requested a 15-day extension to file its Reply on the merits, which was due on December 20, 2004. By letter of December 21, 2004, the two co-arbitrators granted the extension requested by the Claimant, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s letter of September 29, 2004. Accordingly, the Claimant was to file its Reply on the merits no later than January 4, 2005. The Claimant filed its Reply on the merits on December 27, 2004. However, due to the suspension of the proceedings, the Claimant\u2019s Reply was circulated neither to the Tribunal nor to Argentina. After considering several communications exchanged by the parties regarding whether to provide a copy of the Claimant\u2019s Reply to the Respondent, the co-arbitrators decided, with the agreement of the parties, that a copy of the Claimant\u2019s Reply be delivered directly to the Respondent in Buenos Aires and that the Respondent was to file its Rejoinder within 60 (sixty) days from the receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Reply, i.e., no later than March 14, 2005.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of February 3, 2005, the co-arbitrators, having considered the parties\u2019 request to delay for some days the hearing on the merits, granted such request.\n\n34.\n\nOn March 2, 2005, the Respondent requested a 15-day extension to file its Rejoinder due to translation difficulties. On March 3, 2005, the Claimant expressed its opposition to granting the extension.\n\n35.\n\nOn March 10, 2005, the Secretariat sent the parties Judge Brower\u2019s and Professor Bello Janeiro\u2019s separate opinions concerning Argentina\u2019s proposal for disqualification. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 9, the proceeding was to remain suspended pending a decision on the disqualification proposal, and, therefore, the date for the hearing on the merits was postponed indefinitely. In addition, the 15-day extension requested by the Respondent to file its Rejoinder was granted, which was then to be filed no later than March 29, 2005.\n\n36.\n\nOn March 16, 2005, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties that in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention, the Chairman of the Administrative Council was to decide on the Respondent\u2019s proposal for disqualification as the other members of the Tribunal were divided on the proposal. In addition, the Deputy Secretary-General also informed the parties that, because the President of the Tribunal had been a staff member of the World Bank and as proceeded in an earlier similar ICSID case, the request would be sent to the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\") at The Hague to provide his recommendation on the disqualification proposal.\n\n37.\n\nAs directed, on March 29, 2005, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the merits.\n\n38.\n\nOn April 8, 2005, the parties were informed that the PCA would not hold a hearing with the parties, as requested by Argentina, but that it had agreed to receive any additional written information from the parties, besides that already filed by them and provided by ICSID to the PCA. Accordingly, the parties were informed on April 11, 2005, that considering Argentina\u2019s intention to send such additional information, the decision by the Secretary-General of the PCA on the disqualification proposal was postponed until April 15, 2005. On such a date, the Secretary-General of the PCA sent his recommendation to ICSID. Based on that recommendation, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties on April 15, 2005 that the disqualification proposal was not sustained. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 9, the proceeding was resumed with the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal unchanged.\n\n39.\n\nOn April 15, 2005, two letters from the Respondent, dated December 7, 2004 and February 25, 2005, that had been received while the proceedings were suspended, were circulated. In its letters, the Respondent insisted on its request for the production of evidence by the Claimant of: (i) a copy of the \"forward\" contract, and (ii) a copy of SITS\u2019 financial statements and Siemens\u2019 annual reports for the periods therein indicated. The Respondent also requested a 30-day period for the examination of such documents.\n\n40.\n\nOn April 18 2005, the Claimant requested that the hearing on the merits be scheduled to take place at the earliest possible time.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter of April 25, 2005, the Claimant, by invitation of the Tribunal, filed its observations on the Respondent\u2019s letters of December 7, 2004 and February 25, 2005.\n\n42.\n\nOn April 26, 2005, the Tribunal informed the parties that the hearing on the merits would be held on October 10-21, 2005, in Washington, D.C.\n\n43.\n\nBetween June 7, 2005 and July 28, 2005, the parties exchanged multiple communications regarding the Respondent\u2019s document request. The Tribunal granted the Claimant and the Respondent, respectively, time to present observations with respect to the Respondent\u2019s document request, as well as with respect to the different documents presented by the Claimant in this regard, (Tribunal\u2019s letters of June 7 and 27, 2005, and July 15 and 26, 2005). On September 2, 2005, after taking note of the Respondent\u2019s letter of August 17, 2005, objecting to the documents provided by the Claimant in connection with the Respondent\u2019s document request, as well as the Claimant\u2019s response of August 22, 2005, the Tribunal informed the parties that the information filed by the Claimant was not the information that the Tribunal had requested on July 15, 2005. Consequently, the Tribunal ordered the Claimant to furnish the requested information no later than September 8, 2005.\n\n44.\n\nOn September 2, 2005, the parties filed a document with their comments on the Tribunal\u2019s directives concerning the organization of the hearing on the merits. In addition, the parties requested the Tribunal to fix a time limit in order for the parties to file additional documents to be used during the hearing. According to the agreement of the parties, such documents were to be limited to: (i) new issues brought up by the Respondent, its experts or witnesses in its Rejoinder; (ii) documents in support of the examination of witnesses and experts, and (iii) documents related to events that occurred after the parties\u2019 pleadings.\n\n45.\n\nAs instructed by the Tribunal, on September 9, 2005, the Claimant filed accounting information in connection with Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme A.G. (\"SNI\")\u2019s investment in SITS. The Tribunal, by letter of September 12, 2005, invited the Respondent to make any observations on the documents filed by the Claimant no later than September 29, 2005.\n\n46.\n\nBetween September 9, 2005 and September 15, 2005, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s instructions of September 2, 2005, the parties informed the Tribunal of the names of the witnesses and experts that they were planning to examine and cross examine during the hearing as well as their agreement on the order of appearance for the witnesses and experts. (Respondent\u2019s letters of September 9 and September 14, 2006, and Claimant\u2019s letter of September 15, 2006).\n\n47.\n\nOn September 15, 2005, the Tribunal set September 23, 2005 as a deadline for the parties to object to the additional documents that were to be filed respectively by the Claimant and the Respondent.\n\n48.\n\nAs instructed by the Tribunal, the parties filed their respective additional documents on September 16, 2005, and on September 21, 2005, the Claimant submitted further information with respect to the capital contributions made by SNI in SITS.\n\n49.\n\nOn September 27, 2005, following the Tribunal\u2019s invitation of that same date, the Respondent made certain observations with regard to the information filed by the Claimant on September 9 and 21, 2005 in connection with SNI\u2019s investment in SITS.\n\n50.\n\nOn September 28, 2005, the Claimant rebutted the observations made by the Respondent by letter of September 23, 2005, with regard to the additional documents that had been filed by the Claimant on September 16, 2005.\n\n51.\n\nIn connection with the Respondent\u2019s observations filed on September 27, 2005, the Claimant, by letter of October 3, 2005, offered, among other things, to submit, if the Tribunal so requested, a copy of SITS\u2019s books related to its expenditures, as well as any other additional documentary information that the Tribunal may consider appropriate.\n\n52.\n\nOn October 4, 2005, having taken into account the parties\u2019 communications with regard to their additional documents, the Tribunal informed the parties of its decision to: (i) reject certain additional documents filed by the Respondent, which referred to an issue that had been known to the Respondent since 1998, and had not been previously raised; (ii) request explanations from both parties with regard to certain additional documents; (iii) admit other additional documents filed by the Claimant for the reasons stated by the Claimant\u2019s letter of September 28, 2005; and (iv) subject the admission of certain exhibits filed by the Claimant to the timely submission of further explanations from the Claimant in such respect. The Tribunal set October 6, 2005 as the deadline for the parties to provide the information therein requested, and the parties did so.\n\n53.\n\nBy letter of October 4, 2005, the Claimant agreed to the modification of the schedule for the appearance of the witnesses and experts during the hearing requested by the Respondent by a letter of that same date.\n\n54.\n\nOn October 5, 2005, following the Tribunal\u2019s invitation of October 3, 2005, the Respondent filed observations with regard to the Claimant\u2019s objections raised on September 30, 2005 to the inclusion of Mr. Claudio Antonio Michalina as a member of Argentina\u2019s delegation to the hearing on the merits. According to the Claimant, Mr. Michalina was not part of the legal team, but rather an assistant to one of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, Mr. Daniel Eduardo Martin.\n\n55.\n\nAll the pending matters raised before the Tribunal were decided on October 7, 2005, before the hearing on the merits took place. The Tribunal ratified the rejection of the Respondent\u2019s submission of certain additional documents, because they had been known to the Respondent since 1998. The Tribunal also decided that Mr. Michalina could attend the hearing because each party decides who attends the hearings in its representation. Regarding the Claimant\u2019s accounting information requested by the Respondent, the Tribunal decided to accept the information provided by the Claimant, to take note of the Claimant\u2019s willingness to submit SITS\u2019 accounting books, should the Tribunal need them, and to declare that the Claimant had complied with the filing of the supporting documents in connection with SNI\u2019s investment in SITS.\n\n56.\n\nOn October 7, 2005, the Respondent, referring to the Claimant\u2019s letter of September 28, 2005, ratified its objections of September 23, 2005 to the new evidence filed by the Claimant.\n\n57.\n\nThe hearing on the merits took place on October 10-17, 2005, in Washington, D.C., present at the hearing were:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal* Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, President Charles N. Brower, Arbitrator Domingo Bello Janeiro, Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat*\n\nClaudia Frutos-Peterson, Secretary of the Tribunal Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, Consultant\n\n*On behalf of the Claimant* Peter Gnam (Siemens A.G.)\n\nStephan Signer (Siemens A.G.)\n\nRub\u00e9n Daniel Slame (Siemens A.G.)\n\nGuido Santiago Tawil (M. & M.

The Respondent\u2019s letter of November 23, 2005 was contested by the Claimant on December 21, 2005. The Tribunal invited the Respondent to present any observations on this letter by January 14, 2006.\n\n61.\n\nOn January 17, 2006, the Claimant noted that the Respondent had not filed observations on the Claimant\u2019s letter of December 21, 2005 before the deadline set by the Tribunal, and requested the Tribunal to declare the proceeding closed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n62.\n\nOn January 26, 2006, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had not received the Tribunal\u2019s letter of December 27, 2005, and rejected the Claimant\u2019s request for the closure of the proceeding.\n\n63.\n\nOn January 30, 2006, the Claimant sent a letter reiterating that the deadline established by the Tribunal for the Respondent to file any observations on its letter of December 27, 2005 had lapsed, and insisted on its request to the Tribunal to declare the proceedings closed.\n\n64.\n\nOn February 1, 2006, the Respondent sent its observations on the Claimant\u2019s letter of December 21, 2005, as well as supporting documentation to justify why they had not received the Tribunal\u2019s letter of December 27, 2005.\n\n65.\n\nOn February 16, 2006, the Tribunal, after considering the Respondent\u2019s communications of January 26 and February 1, 2006, and that of the Claimant of January 30, 2006, decided: (i) to accept the explanations given by the Respondent with regard to its delay in filing observations to the Claimant\u2019s letter of December 21, 2005; (ii) to admit the Respondent\u2019s letter of February 1, 2006; and (iii) to invite the Claimant to make, no later than February 23, 2006, any observations it might have. The Claimant filed its observations on February 17, 2006.\n\n66.\n\nOn March 1, 2006, the Respondent sent a letter in reply to the Claimant\u2019s letter of February 17, 2006, to which the Claimant answered on March 9, 2006. On March 13, 2006, the Tribunal informed the parties of its decision to disregard such communications because they had not been requested by the Tribunal, and the parties had already had several occasions to raise the observations they had deemed pertinent in such regard (Respondent\u2019s letters of November 23 and 30, 2005, January 26 and February 1, 2006, and Claimant\u2019s letters of December 21.2005, January 17, 30, and February 17, 2006).\n\n67.\n\nOn March 31, 2006, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to reconsider its decision of March 13, 2006. On April 13, 2006, the Tribunal confirmed its decision of March 13, 2006 for the reasons there established.\n\n**II. The Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nArgentina has invited the Tribunal to review its finding on jurisdiction in light of recent decisions in the cases of *Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Republic of Bulgaria1* and *Salini Construttori, S.p.A. & Italstrade, S.p.A. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan2* on the application of the most-favored-nation clause (\"MFN clause\"). The Claimant has for its part referred to the decision of the tribunal in *Gas Natural SDG S.A. v. the Argentine Republic3* which reaches similar conclusions as *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain4* and the Tribunal on the scope of the MFN clause. The Tribunal will not review what it has already decided; it is inappropriate at this stage of the proceedings and the Tribunal has no doubt about its findings. The Tribunal will limit itself to observe that the cases adduced by the Respondent deal with the application of the MFN clause to situations not akin to the instant case. Indeed, in *Plama* and *Salini v. Jordan,* tribunals faced extensions of the MFN clause to situations widely different from the facts considered by the Tribunal or for that matter considered in *Maffezini* or *Gas Natural.* The Claimant in *Salini* sought to include, through the application of a MFN clause, an umbrella clause where the basic treaty had none. In *Plama,* there was no ICSID clause in the basic treaty. There had never been any question that the parties to these proceedings agreed to ICSID jurisdiction and the issue was avoidance, through the MFN clause, of a procedural requirement that Argentina has consistently dispensed within the investment treaties it has concluded since 1994.\n\n*Plama Consortium Ltd. v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction (February 8, 2005).\n\n*Salini Construttori, S.p.A. & Italstrade, S.p.A. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Decision on Jurisdiction (November 29, 2004).\n\n*Gas Natural SDG S.A. v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/10, Decision on Jurisdiction (June 17, 2005).\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction (January 25, 2000).\n\n**III. Applicable Law**\n-----------------------\n\n**1. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nSiemens argues that the Treaty on the Mutual Protection and Promotion of Investments between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Argentine Republic, dated July 9.1991 (\"Treaty\"), contains an explicit choice of law in Article 10(5) which mandates the Tribunal to decide the merits of the dispute \"on the basis of this Treaty, and, as the case may be, on the basis of other treaties in force between the Contracting Parties, the internal law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, including its rules of private international law, and on the general principles of international law\". Siemens then refers to Article 42(1) of the Convention which directs the Tribunal to look first to the rules agreed by the parties. In this case, the rules agreed by the parties are the provisions of the Treaty that constitute a special bilateral regime with respect to the matters regulated by it.\n\n70.\n\nSiemens argues further that, in the case of *lacunae,* general international law applies and it has a corrective role in the sense that it controls and prevails over domestic law. In this respect, Siemens refers to Professor Weil\u2019s statement on the relationship between domestic law and international law under Article 42(1) of the Convention, to wit: \"[...] no matter how domestic law and international law are combined, under the second sentence of Article 42(1), international law always gains the upper hand and ultimately prevails.\"5 Siemens also refers to the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States adopted by the International Law Commission (\"ILC\") (\"Draft Articles\"), which state: \"The characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.\"6\n\nP. Weil, *The State, the Foreign Investor, and International Law: The No Longer Stormy Relationship of a M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois,* 15 ICSID Review - FILJ (2000), p. 409.\n\nArticle 3 of the *Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts**,* adopted by the International Law Commission. Claimant\u2019s LA No. 49.\n\n71.\n\nSiemens contends that this conclusion is reinforced by Article 7(1) of the Treaty which provides:\n\n\"If the laws and regulations of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Treaty contain a regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favorable than is provided for by the Treaty, such regulation shall to the extent that it is more favorable prevail over this Treaty.\"\n\nTherefore, the Claimant argues that Argentine law may prevail over the provisions of the Treaty only to the extent that it provides treatment to the investment more favorable than the Treaty. Conversely, those provisions of domestic law that may be less favorable are not applicable.\n\n72.\n\nIn any case, according to Siemens, the host State\u2019s domestic law is relevant only with respect to factual issues as held by the doctrine and the International Court of Justice (\"1CJ\") in Case *Concerning Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v. Poland)'.*\n\n\"From the standpoint of International Law and of the Court which is its organ, municipal laws are merely facts which express the will and constitute the activities of States, in the same manner as do legal decisions or administrative measures. The Court is certainly not called upon to interpret the Polish Law as such; but there is nothing to prevent the Court\u2019s giving judgment on the question whether or not, in applying that law, Poland is acting in conformity with its obligations towards Germany under the Geneva Convention.\"7\n\n*Case Concerning Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v. Poland),* Judgment No.7, May 25, 1926, 1 World Court Reports (1934), 510, Claimant\u2019s Legal Authorities No. 31.\n\n73.\n\nFurthermore, Siemens points out that, as held by the Annulment Committee in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. the Argentine Republic8* and the tribunal in *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED, S.A. v. the United Mexican States9,* governmental measures that are lawful under domestic law are not necessarily in conformity with international law. Siemens concludes that domestic law is only relevant as evidence of Argentina\u2019s measures and conduct and needs to be analyzed through the lens of international law.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment (July 3, 2002).\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED, S.A. v. the United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award (May 29, 2003).\n\n74.\n\nArgentina contends that there is no express agreement between the parties as to the law applicable to the dispute and that the Treaty does not indicate the law to be applied and, therefore, the Tribunal should apply the municipal law of Argentina. In this respect, Argentina affirms that the constitutional law of Argentina is the first source of law to be applied, and explains that the Argentine Constitution recognizes the right to property and the right of the State to regulate it provided it is done by law and subject to principles of reasonableness and equality. As further explained by Argentina, these principles mean that restrictions on individual rights must be warranted by the facts and meet a social necessity or convenience and the limitation must be in line with the ends sought. Argentina further points out that, under Article 75(22) of the Constitution, treaties rank above the law and, under Article 27, treaties must conform to the principles of public law set by the Constitution.\n\n75.\n\nArgentina draws to the Tribunal\u2019s attention that the constitutional reform of 1994 recognized a number of international instruments on human rights to have constitutional rank. Argentina claims that the human rights so incorporated in the Constitution would be disregarded by recognizing the property rights asserted by the Claimant given the social and economic conditions of Argentina.\n\n**2. Considerations of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal has been established under the provisions of the Treaty and the ICSID Convention. Under Article 42(1) of the Convention, the Tribunal is obliged to apply the rules of law agreed by the parties. The Treaty provides that a tribunal established under the Treaty shall decide on \"the basis of this Treaty, and, as the case may be, on the basis of other treaties in force between the Contracting Parties, the internal law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, including its rules of private international law, and on the general principles of international law.\" By accepting the offer of Argentina to arbitrate disputes related to investments, Siemens agreed that this should be the law to be applied by the Tribunal. This constitutes an agreement for purposes of the law to be applied under Article 42(1) of the Convention.\n\n77.\n\nIn regards to the arguments whether international law is referred to in the Treaty or the Convention as a corrective to municipal law or as a filler of *lacunae* in that law, the Tribunal refers to the finding of the Annulment Committee in *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* in the sense that: \"The law of the host State can indeed be applied in conjunction with international law if this is justified. So too international law can be applied by itself if the appropriate rule is found in this other ambit.\"10\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, *Ad Hoc* Committee Decision on Application for Annulment (February 5, 2002), 41 *ILM* (2002), p. 941.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that it has jurisdiction over breaches of the Treaty and will review the conduct of Argentina as a State party to the Treaty in respect of the commitments undertaken in the Treaty. In so doing, and as stated by the *Ad Hoc* Committee in *Vivendi II,* the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry is governed by the Convention, by the Treaty and by applicable international law. Argentina\u2019s domestic law constitutes evidence of the measures taken by Argentina and of Argentina\u2019s conduct in relation to its commitments under the Treaty.\n\n79.\n\nIn any case, the Treaty is not a document foreign to Argentine law. As explained by Argentina, the Constitution and treaties entered into by Argentina with other States are the supreme law of the nation, and treaties have primacy over domestic laws.11 In this respect, the Tribunal notes the reference made by Argentina to international human rights law ranking at the level of the Constitution after the 1994 constitutional reform and implying that property rights claimed in this arbitration, if upheld, would constitute a breach of international human rights law. This argument has not been developed by Argentina. The Tribunal considers that, without the benefit of further elaboration and substantiation by the parties, it is not an argument that, *prima facie,* bears any relationship to the merits of this case.\n\nSection 31 and Article 75(22) of the Argentine Constitution.\n\n80.\n\nThe allegations of the parties will require that the Tribunal interpret the Treaty. In this respect and as a general matter, the Tribunal recalls that the Treaty should be interpreted in accordance with the norms of interpretation established by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 (\"Vienna Convention\"). The Vienna Convention is binding on the parties to the Treaty. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention requires that a treaty be \"interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n**IV. The Facts**\n-----------------\n\n81.\n\nOn August 26, 1996, Argentina called for bids on the provision of an integral service for the implementation of an immigration control (\"the DNM12 sub-system\"), personal identification (\"the RNP13 sub-system\") and electoral information (\"the DNE14 sub-system\") system (\"the System\" or \"the Project\"), including the provision of all equipment necessary for data processing and the intercommunication of such equipment, start-up, technical support and maintenance services, and preparation, printing and home delivery of national identity cards (\"DNIs\").\n\n*Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Migraciones.*\n\n*Registro Nacional de las Personas.*\n\n*Direcci\u00f3n Nacional Electoral.*\n\n82.\n\nFor the purpose of participating in the bidding, Siemens, acting through SNI, a company legally integrated into Siemens, created SITS, a domestic Argentine company as required by the Bidding Terms and Conditions. SITS was organized as a special purpose company and used by Siemens for the exclusive purpose of investing in the Project.\n\n83.\n\nSITS submitted a bid which included, as required by Argentina, a statement declaring that: (i) SNI had been integrated into Siemens since 1992, Siemens being the owner of 100% of SNI\u2019s stock; (ii) SNI was controlled by Siemens, which appointed SNI\u2019s directors and instructed them in relation to SNI\u2019s activities and projects; and (iii) as a result of SNI\u2019s integration into Siemens, the latter was jointly and severally liable for SNI\u2019s obligations towards third parties.\n\n84.\n\nArgentina selected SITS\u2019 bid taking into consideration Siemens\u2019 credentials and financial soundness. The contract for the provision of the System (\"the Contract\") was awarded to SITS by Decree No. 199/98. The Contract between SITS and Argentina was executed on October 6, 1998 and approved by Decree 1342/98. The Contract took effect on November 21, 1998.\n\n85.\n\nThe compensation for the services to be provided under the Contract consisted of the price of each DNI issued, including home delivery and DNI updates, the fees for the immigration proceedings processed through the System and the price for printing the voting rolls. All prices in the Contract were denominated in Argentine pesos (\"pesos\" or \"AR$\"). At the time, pesos were convertible into dollars at par pursuant to the Convertibility Law.\n\n86.\n\nThe Contract had a six-year term as from its effective date -November 21, 1998 - and was automatically renewable twice for a three-year term, i.e., for a total of twelve years, unless a notice of intent to the contrary had been given by either party. However, the parties had agreed to give such notice only if the purpose of the Contract had been fully met.\n\n87.\n\nThe execution of the Project had two stages: a System engineering stage, which consisted of designing the System specifications and acquiring the computer hardware, software and telecommunications networks necessary for its implementation, and a System operation stage, to be managed by the Government. SITS would receive compensation only during this second stage.\n\n88.\n\nProduction of DNIs was scheduled to begin in August 1999 and extend to the whole country. To this effect, it was necessary for the Argentine government to reach agreements with the Provinces and the City of Buenos Aires (\"the External Circuit\").\n\n89.\n\nIn August 1999, Argentina requested SITS to postpone production of the new DNIs. According to the minutes signed by SITS and the Government, the postponement was due to an extraordinary increase in demand for DNIs because of the short period left before the elections scheduled on October 24, 1999, and to the fear that the introduction of the new mechanisms under such circumstances would burden the public with inconveniences that should be avoided.15 Thus DNIs production was postponed to October 1, 1999 for foreign residents\u2019 DNIs and November 1, 1999 for Argentine citizens\u2019 DNIs. Production of the respective DNIs started on those dates.\n\nMinutes dated August 18, 1999, approved by Decree No. 1054/99. Exhibit 40 to the Memorial.\n\n90.\n\nIn the October election, Mr. Fernando de la R\u00faa became President-elect. The new authorities took office on December 10, 1999.\n\n91.\n\nThe DNM sub-system started to operate on February 1, 2000 and its operation was halted on February 2, 2000. On that date, SITS requested an explanation for the interruption. On February 7, SITS was informed that the operation of the sub-system required a governmental authorization. The subsystem continued to be interrupted indefinitely.\n\n92.\n\nOn February 24, 2000, Argentina suspended the production, printing and distribution of all new DNIs because, in the case of foreigners\u2019 DNIs, the RNP sub-system printed the left thumbprint at the place reserved for the right thumbprint. Argentina prohibited SITS from introducing any modification to the System to correct this problem.\n\n93.\n\nThese two suspensions occurred in the context of statements made by Government officers to SITS and Siemens in January 2000 to the effect that the Government would seek to renegotiate the DNIs price, and increase the number of free-of-charge DNIs.\n\n94.\n\nIn March 2000, the Government set up a special commission under the Ministry of the Interior to review the Contract and propose a course of action (\"the Commission\"). During the negotiations that ensued, Siemens made several proposals and agreement was reached with the Commission on a proposal on November 10, 2000. The Commission sent the negotiated proposal to the Government and the Government gave Siemens a \"Contract Restatement Proposal\" identical in its terms to the proposal submitted by the Commission for the Government\u2019s approval.\n\n95.\n\nSiemens\u2019 representatives met with the President of Argentina on December 19, 2000. Allegedly he promised to issue the decree approving the negotiated terms of the Contract Restatement Proposal by December 31, 2000. When the decree was not issued, Siemens addressed several notes in February 2001 to the Minister of the Interior expressing concern over the delay.16 The Minister replied on March 12, 2001 and attributed the delay to the required intervention of controlling agencies.17\n\nExhibit 57 to the Memorial.\n\nExhibit 58 to the Memorial.\n\n96.\n\nIn November 2000, the Argentine Congress approved the Economic-Financial Emergency Law (\"the 2000 Emergency Law\") which empowered the President to renegotiate public sector contracts. This law became effective two days before the Contract Restatement Proposal was submitted by the Commission to the Minister of the Interior. The Government proposed to include the Contract under the provisions of the 2000 Emergency Law and Siemens did not object, in the belief, according to Siemens, that this step would speed up the approval of the Contract Restatement Proposal.\n\n97.\n\nThe Minister of the Interior was replaced and, in March 2001, the new Minister, Mr. Mestre, claimed to be unaware of the Contract Restatement Proposal. On May 3, 2001, SITS received a new Draft Proposal from the Government which differed from the Contract Restatement Proposal. On May 8, 2001, SITS replied commenting on the new terms, and requesting the exhibits to the proposal which had not been enclosed. The Minister informed Siemens that the new proposal was not negotiable and, on May 18, 2001, the Contract was terminated by Decree 669/01 under the terms of the 2000 Emergency Law. SITS filed an administrative appeal which was rejected by Decree 1205/01.\n\n**V. Allegations of the Parties**\n---------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal will now describe at length the allegations of the parties as they relate to the facts of the dispute.\n\n**1. Memorial**\n---------------\n\n99.\n\nIn its Memorial, Siemens has framed its claim in the context of the Treaty, the Convertibility Law of 1991, Decree No. 2128/91, and the State Reform Law of 1989. Siemens contends that it entered into the Project based on the assurance of the authorities\u2019 commitment and the legal security framework provided by these instruments.\n\n100.\n\nSiemens explains that significant investments were made during 1999 and further investments were made in 2000, due to Argentina\u2019s requirements as a prerequisite for resuming income-generating operations, for an aggregate amount of $284 million up to May 18, 2001. Additional expenses exceeding $9.1 million were incurred after termination of the Contract and until September 2002.\n\n101.\n\nSiemens claims that the following results were achieved:\n\n(i) as regards the DNM sub-system, establishment of the immigration information center, and the immigration flows and border control systems at three locations; the Government first hindered this component from becoming operational and later hindered its functioning, but Argentina has nonetheless benefited from better processing, follow-up and control of immigration proceedings, and the generation of single, non-duplicate files for each alien, containing all identification data, which reduced tampering possibilities;\n\n(ii) as regards the RNP sub-system, the engineering stage was completed by August 1999 and it became operational by August 19, 1999, the electronic loading of the Remaining Human Potential File (\"Back Record Conversion\" or \"BRC\") was performed (by December 1999, 45.8 million individual records had been digitalized), an ID personalization center was completed, hardware and software were acquired, buildings were fitted, the communications network was implemented, training courses were held, more detailed and demanding System applications were developed, and a pilot test not required under the Contract was performed. However, because of the measures taken by Argentina, only 3,189 DNIs were issued over a period of 147 days as opposed to 12,000 DNIs foreseen as the initial daily average;\n\n(iii) as regards the DNE sub-system, the electoral information component was completed by August 1999, and SITS carried out the processing, printing and distribution of provisional lists and final voting rolls for the national elections of October 24, 1999; and\n\n(iv) physical and IT security equipment and technical support were provided by SITS to the three implementation agencies.\n\n102.\n\nSiemens explains that the investments were financed through capital contributions by Siemens through SNI in the amount of $27 million, through loans made by one of the wholly owned subsidiaries or in minor amounts by local financial institutions (later refinanced by Siemens directly or through SNI and totaling approximately $242 million), and through non-financial funding by the Siemens Group in the amount of $15 million approximately up to May 18, 2001. Siemens further explains that the investments were exclusively applied to the Project since SITS was a special purpose company used by Siemens only for the execution of the Project.\n\n103.\n\nSiemens alleges that, during the first year of the Contract, Argentina failed to make budgetary provision for the obligations it had undertaken under the Contract, to provide facilities for Project development, to assign appropriate personnel to fill the different positions and take the corresponding training courses. Siemens also alleges that Argentina delayed approval of the Functional Operational Model (\"FOM\") during seven months notwithstanding its relevance, failed to execute with the provincial authorities the agreements to carry out production of the new DNIs throughout the country, failed to adopt the measures necessary to replace the existing DNIs by those issued through the System, and failed to discontinue the manual system of issuing DNIs. Siemens observes that these breaches of the contractual obligations were noted by the independent auditor hired by the Government.\n\n104.\n\nSiemens recalls that in the context of these failures, in August 1999, Argentina requested SITS, on account of the October elections, to postpone commencement of the new DNIs production until October 1, 1999 for foreign residents and November 1, 1999 for Argentine citizens. Later Argentina requested that the discontinuation of the old DNIs be postponed to November 30, 1999, except for certain jurisdictions for which a new deadline of January 31, 2000 was established.\n\n105.\n\nAccording to Siemens, after the October elections, the new authorities failed to make budgetary provision for the second year of the Project and to enter into agreements with the provincial authorities. Argentina also delayed providing the technical definitions essential to complete the immigration component and, as a result, it did not start to operate until February 1.2000.\n\n106.\n\nSiemens refers to the suspension of the DNM sub-system on February 2, 2000, allegedly because of lack of authorization to operate the subsystem given that public funds were at issue. According to Siemens, the requirement of such authorization was not provided for in the Contract and was not required for the border control component of the DNM sub-system. Siemens alleges that SITS never got an adequate response and was never paid for the documents actually processed.\n\n107.\n\nRegarding the suspension of production of DNIs on February 24, 2001, Siemens affirms that this is a technical inconsistency that could have been quickly solved by modifying one sentence in the printing software. Siemens recalls that Article 17 of the Contract established a procedure in the event that errors were detected but, instead of respecting it, the Argentine authorities prohibited SITS from introducing any correction while the Contract was in effect.\n\n108.\n\nAccording to Siemens, since January 2000 the newly elected authorities had made public announcements reported in the press indicating their intention to renegotiate the Contract to obtain a reduction in the DNI price, a larger number of free DNIs and a postponement of the discontinuation of the manual system. Siemens submits that the actions taken in February 2000 by Argentina suspending the two income-generating activities of the Project had the objective of pressuring SITS to re-negotiate the Contract at the point at which most of the investment for the Project had been made.\n\n109.\n\nSiemens explains that, during the renegotiation of the Contract with the Commission from March to November 2000, each proposal made by SITS was rejected and resumption of the operation of the System was subject to ever more demanding economic concessions. In November 2000, as explained by Siemens, the parties agreed on the basic terms on which the Contract would be reinstated and the immediate System operation would be resumed, namely, a $5 reduction in the price of the DNIs (in part to be compensated by a $3 increase in airport passengers\u2019 fees to be passed on to SITS), an increase in the annual free-of-charge DNIs from 75,000 to 250,000, and a reduction in the immigration and voting roll printing fees. Siemens draws to the attention of the Tribunal that the Ministry of Finance authorities opined favorably on the new terms as also did the RNP, DNM and DNE. The restated terms were set forth in the Contract Restatement Proposal provided by the Government to Siemens on November 30, 2000 with the understanding that this proposal would now be formalized by the Government.\n\n110.\n\nSiemens explains that the 2000 Emergency Law was published on November 21, 2000 and that, in order to facilitate the approval of the terms agreed, the Commission proposed to include the Contract under the provisions of the 2000 Emergency Law in a note to the Minister of the Interior dated November 23, 2000.18 The Minister declared the Contract subject to the 2000 Emergency Law by Resolution No. 1779 of December 6, 2000.19\n\nExhibit 55 to the Memorial.\n\nExhibit 60 to the Memorial.\n\n111.\n\nSiemens alleges that, when in March 2001 a new Minister of the Interior was appointed, he claimed to be unaware of the agreement reached between the two parties and the undertaking made by the President. The new Minister ordered, on April 6, 2001, the inclusion in the administrative file of the minutes, dated October 30, 2000, of a meeting of Directors of Provincial Registry Offices rejecting the Contract continuation. According to Siemens, he also instructed Sindicatura General de La Naci\u00f3n (\"SIGEN\"), RPN, DNM and DNE to re-analyze matters related to the Contract and these agencies reached different conclusions from when they reviewed the Contract Restatement Proposal.\n\n112.\n\nSiemens refers to the new Draft Proposal presented to Siemens on May 3, 2001 with terms significantly different from those negotiated, mainly, reduction of the number of DNIs to be issued to almost one half as it did the effective term of the Contract, and elimination of the obligation to discontinue issuance of the old DNIs. Siemens points out that the exhibits referred to in the Proposal were not furnished to SITS. According to Siemens, the only purpose of this proposal was to trigger a rejection and create an excuse to terminate the Contract. In its Reply on May 8, Siemens recalled that the parties had already reached an agreement and certain aspects had already been implemented, and that the changes indicated above were unacceptable because they changed completely the economic-financial equation, and requested the missing exhibits to complete the evaluation. The Minister responded immediately indicating that failure to accept such proposal as a whole would result in early termination of the Contract. In fact, even when the proposal was presented to Siemens as a draft, the instruction of the Minister was that the Proposal was to be notified for acceptance or rejection.20\n\nExhibit 66 to the Memorial.\n\n113.\n\nSiemens argues that such a proposal was only an illegitimate tool to avoid liability for frustrating the Contract. In this respect, *inter alia,* Siemens points out a number of irregularities in the proceedings for the Contract termination, such as the failure to obtain the Ministry of Economy\u2019s consent to subject the Contract to the 2000 Emergency Law and factual inaccuracies, e.g. the covering letter from the Minister of the Interior to the President submitting Decree 669/01 stated that the Contract costs were beyond the capabilities of the Government notwithstanding that there were no supporting budgetary reports and in November 2000 the Ministry of Economy had opined otherwise,21 and the Government had approved the budget for the proposed restated terms of the Contract which in turn had been approved by Congress on December 12, 2000 and the President on December 29, 2000.22 Siemens also points out that said letter reports errors in the System without supporting evidence (errors which were disregarded by the President), it uses the Provinces\u2019 opposition to the Project notwithstanding that the Contract was undertaken by Argentina itself within its exclusive powers,23 and it exaggerates deliberately the costs based on RPN\u2019s analysis.\n\nExhibit 53 to the Memorial.\n\nExhibit 70 to the Memorial.\n\nArticle 2 of Law No. 17,671. Exhibit 35 to the Memorial.\n\n114.\n\nSiemens points out that the Contract was terminated on the sole grounds of the 2000 Emergency Law, which termination was ratified by Decree No. 1205/01 rejecting SITS\u2019s appeal against Decree 669/01. Siemens recalls that Argentina denied SITS access to the administrative file for purposes of filing the appeal and presenting evidence in support of its claims. Siemens alleges that the administrative file was not made available until Siemens reported the secret handling of the file and Siemens had filed the claim under the Treaty. After Contract termination, Siemens claims that Argentina caused delays in the transfer and reception of equipment and in the assessment of the compensation, and never returned the performance bond, which had lost its purpose once Argentina terminated the Contract unilaterally. According to Siemens, SITS continued to provide technical support, train personnel as agreed in cases of Contract termination, assigned to the Government ownership of the computer hardware, the installed communications equipment and fittings and the nonexclusive licenses for use of application software, and requested the Ministry of the Interior to arrange for the transfer of the satellite links.\n\n115.\n\nSiemens points out the passivity of the Government during the months that followed the termination of the Contract and that in November 2001, the Ministry of the Interior called the SITS\u2019 sub-contractors to conduct a test and assess the possibility of resuming production of the DNIs without Siemens. According to Siemens, the tests conducted in Casa *de Moneda* were satisfactory and *Casa de Moneda* proposed to produce DNIs through the System provided by SITS.\n\n**2. Counter-Memorial**\n-----------------------\n\n116.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Argentina alleges that Siemens raised false expectations by the statements made in the bid for the Contract. Siemens had stressed its experience and that of its sub-contractors in high-performance secure systems to meet automated data and image-capturing requirements for issuing passports, foreign resident documents, drivers licenses, visas, frequent traveler cards, health plan cards and DNIs, but in reality neither Siemens nor SNI had been involved in projects of a similar size because no country in the world had undertaken a project of the complexity, size and significance of the Project. According to Argentina, Siemens and SNI lacked the technical expertise to provide a comprehensive service involving the operation and support of a secure and reliable personal identification, migration control and electoral information system.\n\n117.\n\nAs regards Siemens\u2019 claim that Argentina delayed the approval of the FOM and it is at fault for the non-implementation of the External Circuit, Argentina argues that Siemens presents a traditional notion of contracts with the parties\u2019 obligations bearing a relationship of interdependence and does not take into account the particularities and complexities surrounding the procurement of information technology products and services. Argentina explains that the Contract is a turnkey information technology contract including tailored software development and it is inevitable that there will be some uncertainty as to the actual completion date of the work.\n\n118.\n\nArgentina alleges that in this type of contract the reporting and advisory duties of the information technology service provider and product supplier play a key role in maintaining the balance between the parties. Argentina recognizes that it received assistance from technical personnel who participated in the guideline-setting stages for the technical definition of the System, but this is not sufficient, argues Argentina, to eliminate the imbalance in technical expertise level between the parties.\n\n119.\n\nAs regards the approval of the FOM, Argentina describes how, a few days before the deadline for the presentation of the FOM, it requested SITS to deliver the working papers so that RNP\u2019s technical staff could advance with the examination of the FOM. SITS never provided the documentation requested. Argentina refers to a number of communications sent to SITS that show the delay in the acceptance of the FOM by Argentina was due to inconsistencies in the FOM proposed by SITS. To further support its argument, Argentina refers to two reports prepared by RNP on the weaknesses of the FOM submitted by SITS and the security of the FOM. In brief terms, several items in the FOM submitted by SITS did not comply with applicable law, were defined on a general or incomplete basis, or failed to provide specifications for the security, audit, and quality and management control of the System. Argentina infers from the foregoing that SITS\u2019 technical qualifications were not sufficient to perform the Contract and that it used the Project to gain experience.\n\n120.\n\nAs regards the External Circuit, Argentina explains that SITS and Argentina through RNP agreed that the proposed model could not be implemented as described in the Contract and SITS was requested to design an External Circuit taking into account the following general guidelines: (i) flexible terms for a gradual regional implementation; (ii) installation of computers in the Manual Data Capture Centers under the charge of SITS to facilitate form scanning; (iii) set-up of scanning and quality control centers in every provincial capital, for purposes of resolving any possible rejection of the applications in the applicant\u2019s location; and (iv) the maintenance by the contractor of the investment levels that had originally been agreed.\n\n121.\n\nArgentina further explains that it is not surprising that the Provinces were not interested in signing framework agreements for the External Circuit since they were not advantageous from an economic point of view; under them, the Provinces would receive lower compensation while the expenses they had to incur for the System to work efficiently were higher. Argentina also refers to the nature of its federal system of government where the Government cannot oblige the Provinces to enter into agreements to cooperate in the performance of functions that belong to the Federal Government.\n\n122.\n\nArgentina argues that SITS was aware of the circumstances of the country, it had admitted that the design of the External Circuit was not consistent with the social reality of Argentina and it was necessary to do a comprehensive review of the design, the External Circuit could not be implemented until the FOM was approved on condition that SITS fulfilled certain requirements, and, in the agreement signed between Argentina and SITS on November 26, 1999, the Coordinator of the Project at RNP and the SITS\u2019 Project Director were empowered to introduce amendments to the System set-up schedules and in the size of the Electronic Data Capture Centers.\n\n123.\n\nArgentina also argues that, given the long presence of Siemens in the country and as a product and service provider to the public sector, SITS should have been aware of the political issues that would necessarily have an impact on the performance of some stages of the Contract and compliance with its obligations.\n\n124.\n\nArgentina alleges that data capture for the External Circuit could not be set up in the Provinces because of the suspension of manufacturing, printing and distribution of DNIs on February 24, 2000. Argentina alleges also non-compliance by SITS with its obligation to deposit the source codes in escrow and transfer them to the Government upon completion of the Contract. Argentina affirms that without the source codes it could not properly operate the System after termination of the Contract. Furthermore, Argentina had detected errors in the System and the source codes were necessary to correct SITS\u2019 work.\n\n125.\n\nArgentina contends that, contrary to Siemens\u2019 claim that Argentina did not comply with the schedule provided for in the Contract to cease issuing DNIs manually, SITS had agreed to reformulate the terms of the Contract applicable to begin issuing new DNIs and consented to the extension of the term for the discontinuation of manual DNI issuance.\n\n126.\n\nArgentina explains that the Contract did not amend the law regulating when DNIs are issued and updated. The law requires that a DNI be issued when a baby is born and this document is updated when the child reaches school age. Then a photograph is added to the identity document and the right thumb fingerprint is stamped on the document. This DNI is replaced when a person turns sixteen and a new photograph is taken. Then this DNI is updated when a person turns thirty. In order to determine whether the Project was economically advantageous, SITS should have calculated the number of DNIs that had to be replaced.\n\n127.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the RNP sub-system was the most important undertaking since the revenues it would generate would guarantee the expected return on the investment made by Siemens, and it was precisely in the design of this sub-system that SITS failed to comply with its obligations. On February 23, 2000, the RNP head of the Aliens Division reported that federal police officers had discovered that on two DNIs belonging to foreigners the fingerprint was incorrectly identified, e.g., the left thumbprint was identified as the right thumbprint. Argentina explains that the technical report states that the fingerprint experts verified that the fingerprints had been correctly taken by RNP staff. The head of the RNP Aliens Division concluded that the error was in the design of the System which was entrusted exclusively to the Claimant, which defeated the purpose of implementing an information technology system to avoid the risk of human error.\n\n128.\n\nArgentina contests that Article 17 of the Contract was applicable in that situation. Argentina explains that such article is intended to regulate the parties\u2019 conduct in the event of any possible physical error of the identity document and not an error involving the inappropriate design.\n\n129.\n\nArgentina then turns to the 2000 Emergency Law and points out that this law provided that the events of *force majeure* foreseen in sections 53 and 54 of Law No. 13,064 were considered to have occurred, that within 30 days the Government should determine the contracts subject to the provisions of the 2000 Emergency Law, that government contracts would not be terminated if the continuation of the works or the performance of the contract was possible on the basis of the \"shared sacrifice\" principle, and that compensation payable in the case of those contracts revoked on grounds of convenience, merit and advisability would not include lost profit or unproductive expenses.\n\n130.\n\nArgentina further points out that in no circumstances did the Contract entail the privatization of the System\u2019s operation and that the goal of the Commission established by Resolution No. 263/00 was to find a solution ensuring the continuity of the Contract given the crisis in Argentina. Argentina explains the doctrine of unforseeability that would apply in the emergency situation:\n\n\"There is certainly no obligation for the Government to compensate the contractor as the events causing the contractual imbalance are totally beyond the Government\u2019s control. There is nothing that would prevent the strict and specific application of the contract provisions and thus the termination of the contract [...] However, no benefit for the public interest can be derived from this situation; quite the contrary, the public interest will not be satisfied by the abrupt interruption of the service provision. Thus, the doctrine of unforeseeability or unforeseeable risk may be applied to these cases. According to the doctrine, the Government has to provide assistance to the concessionaire, sharing the risks that unpredictability might have arisen for purposes of avoiding a total collapse of the licensed service.\"24\n\nE. Garc\u00eda-Enterr\u00eda and T. Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez, *Curso de Derecho Administrativo* (1997), vol. I, p. 732. Counter-Memorial, para. 555.\n\n131.\n\nArgentina further explains that it is obliged to revoke a public contract when the public need that would be satisfied by the contract disappeared or new public demands require that it be terminated. Revocation by reason of public interest is one of the cases of a Government\u2019s liability for lawful actions and entails the obligation to compensate the contractor whose individual right is sacrificed for the sake of the public, but compensation shall not include lost profits or unproductive expenses.\n\n132.\n\nArgentina disputes Siemens\u2019 affirmation that the Government took advantage of the passing of the 2000 Emergency Law allegedly to accelerate the implementation of the agreement concluded with Siemens. Argentina explains that it is correct that SITS participated in the report prepared by the Commission, but it is not correct that such report had to be considered by the Government and SITS as a formal and final renegotiation proposal. According to Argentina, the report was an initial contract renegotiation proposal which included the Contractor\u2019s point of view.\n\n133.\n\nArgentina also questions the position taken by Siemens in respect of the role of SIGEN and its refusal to furnish the cost structure of SITS\u2019 services. According to Argentina, SIGEN was unable to determine the reasonableness of compensation to SITS because it had not access to conclusive information about the cost of the services. Argentina disputes the allegation that the reduction of the original DNIs price reflected SITS\u2019 share of the sacrifice to continue with implementation of the Contract. Argentina recalls in this respect that Article 4.6.2 of the Contract required disclosure of SITS\u2019 cost structure where extraordinary and unforeseeable events materially and adversely affect the original economic and financial equation of the Contract.\n\n134.\n\nArgentina also takes issue with the characterization by the Claimant of the 2000 Emergency Law as an instrument devised to hurt the Claimant. Argentina also contests the truthfulness of the assertion by Siemens that it has been penalized by pursuing this arbitration and lists a number of public sector contracts won by Siemens in recent years. According to Argentina, Siemens continued to do business with the Government and with other public sector players and provided new services after the termination of the Contract.\n\n135.\n\nArgentina describes the steps involved in the reception of SITS\u2019 assets to justify the delay, which it also ascribes to lack of cooperation by SITS at that stage. Indeed, according to Argentina, SITS refused to participate in the asset verification process because the inventories already submitted by SITS included all necessary specifications for asset identification. In fact, according to Argentina, SITS\u2019 inventories in most cases referred to total quantities without a breakdown that would permit actual verification of the assets\u2019 existence and their relevance to the System. Argentina claims that, in contrast, the Notary General\u2019s Office recorded the asset verification proceedings, including a list of the assets present in the various agencies belonging to the System and unequivocal information regarding each and every asset.25\n\nExhibit 144 to the Counter-Memorial.\n\n136.\n\nArgentina also refers to the issue of the verification of certain computer equipment stored at the Siemens National Route 8 plant in San Martin County in the Province of Buenos Aires. Argentina claims that the Government was only informed of the existence of such equipment in a presentation made by SITS to the Asset Reception Committee on September 4, 2001. Argentina explains the difficulties that this revelation presented for the Government as, among other matters, it was uncertain whether these assets were part of the assets to be transferred under Article 10.7 of the Contract and, if they were, it was unclear whether or not the Government should actually receive them because of SITS\u2019 refusal to transfer title to those assets until payment was made to SITS. The Asset Reception Committee decided to accept the National Route 8 assets on December 17, 2001 and that on December 20, 2001, both parties should agree on a procedure to receive them. The serious events that happened on that date led to the worst ever political and institutional crisis in Argentina, but once the new authorities were in place in Argentina, the Asset Reception Committee continued with its work and requested the Tribunal de Tasaciones de la Nacion (\"TTN\") to appraise the assets.\n\n137.\n\nThen Argentina describes the performance tests of the various sub-systems at RPN, DNE and DNM and affirms that in all three cases the technicians concluded that the sub-systems were not operative. Argentina explains that SITS was invited to attend the tests but refused the invitation. Furthermore, the tests had to be carried out without access to the source codes that SITS should have turned over to Argentina at Contract termination. According to Argentina, without the source codes it was not possible to determine the degree of progress by SITS regarding the purpose of the Contract and it was not possible to conduct an accurate appraisal.\n\n138.\n\nArgentina provides the breakdown of the appraisal conducted by the TTN, which in the aggregate amounts to AR$71,735,510, and explains that the items appraised would be valuable only if, among other matters, SITS would deliver the source codes, the licenses for basic software and databases, and the use of SITS\u2019 software licenses. Argentina reports that the TTN pointed out that it was not certain that all licenses could be transferred as their respective contracts did not provide for such possibility.\n\n139.\n\nAs regards the performance bond, Argentina argues that it ends on termination of the Contract, provided that the Contractor has fulfilled its obligations under the Contract, which has not been the case. Argentina in this respect particularly emphasizes the fact that the source codes and the software licenses have not been delivered by SITS to the Government.\n\n**3. Reply**\n------------\n\n140.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant notes that Argentina recognizes the fundamental facts of the case and the events that frustrated Siemens\u2019 investment. The Claimant takes issue with the argument that Argentina was the weaker party because of an alleged technology gap. The Claimant points out this cannot be true when Argentina had designed the Bidding Terms and Conditions, defined the characteristics of the service, and reserved the right to control and manage the tasks during Contract performance.\n\n141.\n\nSiemens disputes that there was a mutually agreed renegotiation process. According to Siemens, the Government took advantage of the sunk cost of Siemens\u2019 investment to impose a renegotiation process not provided for in the Contract. Siemens also questions the arguments based on security concerns. Siemens first points out that lack of security or reliability of the System was not the subject of any discussion between the parties during the performance of the Contract, that these arguments were developed after the Contract termination, and that the only audit report issued during the term of the Contract on the security of the System was submitted to the authorities by the external security auditor appointed by the Government, which audit report concluded that the System reasonably complied with the security standards required by the Contract. According to Siemens, this is confirmed by the termination of the Contract with no finding of fault on the part of the Contractor (Decree 669/01) and the ratification of the termination in September 2001 after the SIGEN reports had been issued (Decree 1205/01).\n\n142.\n\nSiemens also points out that the security concerns of the old system which motivated the tender (Decree 1310/94) for a new system are still valid, while the security and reliability of the System was never questioned before this arbitration. Siemens surmises that if the real concern had been security, then the logical course of action would have been to allow the Contract\u2019s performance, instead of discontinuing the Project and preserving the system that caused the documentary emergency from which Argentina is still suffering.\n\n143.\n\nSiemens argues that Argentina distorts reality and deliberately intends to confuse the situation that led to the passage of the 2000 Emergency Law with the economic and political crisis that resulted in the enactment of Emergency Law No. 25,561 in 2002. Siemens explains that, contrary to the description made by Argentina, the 2000 Emergency Law only declared the fiscal accounts in emergency and empowered the new administration to repudiate certain contracts concluded by its predecessor. According to Siemens, the emergency was not related to \"extraordinary and unforeseeable\" events unrelated to the State as claimed by Argentina, because public deficits fail to meet such qualifications: the events that led to the enactment of the 2000 Emergency Law were attributable exclusively to the State itself.\n\n144.\n\nSiemens contests Argentina\u2019s allegations regarding its technical qualifications. Siemens recalls that in the bidding process SITS was allocated the best ratings in terms of experience in the implementation and or administration of the System, and in project integration and capacity to handle the Project. Siemens recalls that Argentina holds Siemens in such high regard that it has repeatedly requested its intervention in other public projects, even after the Contract\u2019s termination.\n\n145.\n\nSiemens dismisses Argentina\u2019s allegations regarding defects in the Contract and recalls that, in compliance with Decree No. 1310/94, the Ministry of the Interior approved the Bidding Terms of Conditions through Resolution No. 2183/96, stating in the whereas clauses that RPN, DNM, DNE, the Ministry of the Interior, the Attorney General\u2019s office and SIGEN had been involved in their preparation. RPN, DNM and DNE prepared reports for the Technical Evaluation Committee which concluded: \"it may be inferred from the technical reports received, from which contents this Committee finds no reasons to depart,\"26 that the bidders have complied with all the provisions referring to the items and amounts tendered, and that \"it is appropriate to share the conclusions reached by the Technical Agencies consulted [RNP, DNM, DNE], that SIEMENS IT\u2019s rating is 13.03% higher than the rating [,..].\"27 Furthermore, it is Siemens\u2019 contention that:\n\n\"Only Argentina was in a position to identify its own political, economic and social needs involved in the System. It was also the one that had the duty to set the requirements consistent with its own capabilities and limitations. Contrary to its claims, it was Argentina and not the Contractor that had the duty to inform its contractual party of the economic, political or social limitations that could be encountered in the design, implementation and subsequent development of the Project.\"28\n\nReply, para. 137.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 138.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 142.\n\n146.\n\nAs regards the delayed approval of the FOM and the allegation by Argentina that SITS lacked the technical capacity to perform the Contract, Siemens asserts that the reasons that delayed FOM approval were not of a technical nature that could be ascribed to SITS, but originated in the indolent attitude of the Government and its lack of cooperation with SITS.\n\n147.\n\nSiemens contests the presentation made by Argentina on the failure of implementing the External Circuit and the implication that it was Siemens that designed this circuit and determined its need. According to Siemens, the model incorporating the External Circuit was created by Argentina taking into account the country\u2019s geographical extent and the rules applicable to its personal identification and registration activity. Furthermore, Argentina has justified not making the necessary budget allocations on the basis of ignorance of the characteristics required for the buildings allocated to the External Circuit. Siemens claims that this is not a valid reason because Argentina had all the information to purchase the properties and prepared a budget estimate months later when the System was paralyzed.\n\n148.\n\nAs regards the failure to discontinue the production of the old manually produced DNIs, Siemens recalls that the \"cut-over\" criterion was a basic commitment of Argentina under the Contract and an essential component of the Project, that, in any case, Argentina did not meet the new deadlines agreed reluctantly by SITS, and that the error detected by the police occurred several months after the original date of the \"cut-over\" and after the new deadlines.\n\n149.\n\nSiemens contends that the decision to suspend the for-profit-operations of the System were arbitrary. In the case of the fingerprint error, Siemens insists that it originated in a mistaken software sentence found in the programming of one of the applications. According to Siemens, SITS acknowledged the error and offered to correct it immediately, but the Government decided to suspend provisionally the processing of DNIs for Argentine nationals and foreigners throughout the System. The decision remained in effect until the termination of the Contract.\n\n150.\n\nSiemens contests the interpretation given by Argentina to Article 17 of the Contract. This Article does not distinguish between design errors and errors related to individual documents; it simply refers to a DNI that may have errors resulting from any cause, whether attributable to SITS or the Government.\n\n151.\n\nSiemens recalls that the services provided by SITS to the DNM and DNE were accepted by the relevant agencies and that, in the case of the DNM sub-system, its operation was suspended because of the alleged lack of formal authorization for the launch of the sub-system after one day of operation and not because of the flaws that Argentina now points out, supported by a report of SIGEN of September 2001, four months after termination of the Contract and eighteen months after the suspension of the sub-system operation. According to Siemens, the sub-system is in use by DNM to this date.\n\n152.\n\nSiemens questions the use of the technical studies presented by Argentina in this arbitration when the Government did not consider that SITS had committed breaches to allow the Contract\u2019s termination, nor did it ever notify SITS of the serious breaches now invoked in accordance with the procedures provided for in the Contract, nor imposed any sanctions whatsoever based on the alleged inconsistencies of the System. According to Siemens, SIGEN produced its reports months after the System had started to operate with express approval of RPN, and after the authorities had already decided to terminate the Contract. Siemens claims that Argentina did not convey the reports or their recommendations to SITS or Siemens and refers to Article 10.2 of the Contract, which provides that:\n\n\"Following Systems implementation, but prior to their being put into operation, the security and high degree of inviolability of the Systems shall be tested and certified by a world-class auditor appointed by mutual agreement of the parties. The inexistence of observations from the State\u2019s Security Officer shall imply the acceptance of the Systems\u2019 security and inviolability test results.\"\n\n153.\n\nSiemens affirms that the only auditing reports provided for in the Contract determined the reasonable accomplishment of the System\u2019s security standards, including the initial stage, SITS\u2019 compliance with its contractual obligations, and the Government\u2019s non-compliance with theirs. Siemens points out that these reports were ignored by the Government and excluded from the administrative files, probably, Siemens surmises, because their outcome was deemed unfavorable to Argentina.\n\n154.\n\nSiemens recalls that two months prior to the creation of the Commission, and days before the suspension of for-profit operations, the new authorities declared publicly before informing SITS of their intentions that the Contract had to be reviewed. Siemens also recalls that the technical aspects were irrelevant in the discussions to renegotiate the Contract, and that the issues discussed were limited to the reduction in the number of DNIs, migration proceedings prices, the redesign of the External Circuit, the progressive discontinuance of the manual system as opposed to the \"cut-over\", an increase in the amount of free-of-charge DNIs, etc. Siemens submits that these were not \"external circumstances\" or an \"extraordinary and unforeseeable event that materially affected the equilibrium of the relationship\", but reflected the opposition of the new Administration to the obligations undertaken by its predecessor. Siemens notes that, with a high degree of political opportunism, the Government took advantage of the fact that by then most of the investment for the Project had been made.\n\n155.\n\nSiemens questions the correctness of the *ius variandi* as understood by Argentina. First, Siemens refers to the acknowledgement by Argentina that the power of the Government to vary the terms may be exercised only to the extent to which the economic balance of the contract is preserved. However, Siemens points out that Argentina neglects to mention the limitations to the *ius variandi.* Indeed, the authority of the State to modify the terms and conditions of the contract does not affect those provisions pertaining to compensation and financial advantages, since it would be contrary to the principle of good faith and to business security to allow the State to modify the contract unilaterally and reduce compensation. Siemens refers to the limitations imposed by the Argentine Constitution and law, in particular the property safeguard (Article 17 of the Constitution), the proportionality principle (Article 28 of the Constitution), the *pacta sunt servanda* rule (Article 1197 of the Civil Code) and the principle of good faith (Article 1198 of the Civil Code).\n\n156.\n\nSiemens argues that, when Argentina called for foreign investment to carry out its public sector transformation in 1990, Argentina assumed that some of the legal features of the public contract could discourage investors and deliberately self-limited its public powers and prerogatives. Siemens points out that one of the most important limitations was directed at preventing the unilateral modification or termination of contracts, even if ostensibly in the \u2018public interest.\u201929 Thus Article 33.6 of the Contract provides that, \"Any change or amendment to this Contract shall be agreed upon by the parties and set forth in writing.\" Article 26.1 limits early termination by the State to cases of SITS\u2019 fault, and Article 3.5.2 limits early termination by the State until all existing DNIs issued as of the date of the Contract had been replaced.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 225.\n\n157.\n\nSiemens submits that \"if the State does not comply with the previously described limitations, it would be in breach of its duties and it should be accountable for its wrongful acts by fully compensating the contractor for having deprived it of its vested rights and/or having frustrated its legitimate expectations (as appropriate).\"30 Siemens also points out that Argentina does not specify any new events that would justify a different assessment of the public interest as it was when the Contract was awarded; a change of Administration is not a valid legal ground. The renegotiation of the Contract was initiated, not as an exercise of Argentina\u2019s discretionary powers, but as an attempt to depart from its contractual obligations.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 229.\n\n158.\n\nSiemens insists that there was \"no mutual will to renegotiate following a change in circumstances, but a coerced process involving substantial alterations of the initial conditions to the detriment of SITS, strongly conditioned by the fact that - the investment already being made - the State suspended the operations of the income generating systems [sub-systems] [,..].\"31\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 242.\n\n159.\n\nSiemens recalls the Argentine Supreme Court constitutionality test for emergency measures that restrict individual rights, namely, they may last only as long as necessary to allow the cause of the measures to disappear, and \"Even where a more intense exercise of police power is recognized in emergency circumstances, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that an individual\u2019s own property cannot be taken without a declaration of public use and prior compensation.\"32 The application of the 2000 Emergency Law to terminate the Contract was a political decision and not, as alleged by Argentina, the result of events \"absolutely alien and independent from the administrative activity.\"33\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 259.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 262.\n\n160.\n\nSiemens contends that the disclosure of SITS\u2019 cost structure was necessary only at a later stage and points out that, during the 14 months of negotiations prior to SIGEN\u2019s report in March 2001, this issue was never raised. Furthermore, the Contract was based on a price cap and the cost to Argentina did not depend on SITS\u2019 cost structure, the conditions of Article 4.6.2 of the Contract had not been met and the 2000 Emergency Law did not trigger them, and even the Draft Proposal of May 2001 did not require any disclosure.\n\n161.\n\nSiemens notes that there was no \"shared sacrifice\" and that the burden was exclusively on SITS is particularly evident in the May 2001 Draft Proposal intended to provoke a rejection from SITS and to justify the termination of the Contract on the basis of the 2000 Emergency Law. Siemens asserts that its reply to the proposal was not a rejection, but that it only insisted on the need to reach a solution that would respect the parties\u2019 rights and previous commitments, and requested the missing annexes for a correct assessment of the proposal.\n\n162.\n\nSiemens recalls that the new Minister of the Interior ordered new reports from RNP, DNM and DNE and that these agencies issued reports in April 2001 that differ from those issued in December 2000, particularly in the case of RNP. The proposal of May 2001 shows that technical issues were not relevant and the disclosure of the cost structure was not required by the State at the time of formulating such proposal. The State had not required it as a condition of the Contract when it was awarded nor was it part of the November 2000 Contract Restatement Proposal.\n\n163.\n\nSiemens points out that it was denied access to the administrative file until August 2001 -three months after termination of the Contract - and then it realized that: the file had been started on December 13, 2000, it included documents dated from as early as January 2000, and reports favorable to the Contract\u2019s continuation were absent. According to Siemens, such reports apparently had been included in the file and then removed without indicating the reason; notably, the SWIPCO reports were missing and were also ignored in the Counter-Memorial.\n\n164.\n\nSiemens then refers to the contracts that Argentina has reported in the Counter-Memorial to have been terminated under the 2000 Emergency Law to respond to the claim of discrimination, and argues that these contracts were not comparable, that main contracts involving foreign investments had been formally excluded, that most of them had been renegotiated and not terminated and that the two public works terminated were in the end terminated because of the contractors\u2019 fault. Siemens points out that a passport contract between a local company and the State is not included in the list presented by Argentina, and was not subject to the 2000 Emergency Law notwithstanding how expensive it was.\n\n165.\n\nSiemens claims that, after termination of the Contract, the behavior of Argentina was as arbitrary as before, namely, it denied access of SITS to the administrative file, subjected SITS\u2019 compensation to the performance and to the physical tests of the System after it had been in the power of the State since its transfer and over which SITS had lost control a long time before, excluded SITS from the tests at Casa *de Moneda,* and issued reports unfavorable to SITS without notifying SITS or including them in the administrative file. Siemens claims that Argentina\u2019s lack of good faith is confirmed by bringing before this Tribunal a large number of contractual breaches absent any actual decision of the Government pertaining to the Contract.\n\n166.\n\nSiemens affirms that SITS took every possible action to overcome the difficulties placed in its way by Argentina and to avoid the expropriation of the Contract and recover its investment.\n\n167.\n\nSiemens points out that it took Argentina 28 months to receive the assets transferred from SITS. Siemens recalls how Argentina did not take measures for the orderly transfer of the non-exclusive licenses for the use of the applications software or the contract for the supply of satellite link services, and all links between SITS\u2019 help desk and the System were cut in May 2001. Siemens claims that the passive behavior of Argentina caused losses and jeopardized the System. Hence, SITS could not agree to any physical, performance or functionality test carried out by the Government after its damaging attitude.\n\n168.\n\nSiemens notes the positive results of the test at Casa *de Moneda* in order to verify the overall operation of the System. Siemens refers to the following statement in a letter provided by the President of *Casa de Moneda* to the Under-Secretary of the Interior reporting on the test results:\n\n\"As per your request, I would like to inform you the positive result of the verification test of the operativity [s/c] of the General Persons Identification System that forms part of the Argentine and International Public Bidding Process No. 01/96, the contract of which was terminated by Decree 669/01.\n\n[...]\n\nTherefore, it has been verified that it is possible to print identity documents at the plant.\"34\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 341, emphasis added by the Claimant.\n\n169.\n\nSiemens also points out that SITS\u2019 sub-contractors who were present at the tests reported that they \"[...] evidenced the successful operation of the systems set up for the production of DNIs, and that pursuant to Section 2 of Decree No. 669/2001 those systems were received by the Government.\"35 Siemens refers to press reports on the satisfactory functioning of the System notwithstanding attempts by officials of RNP to prevent its operation to the extent that floppy disks and software applications containing important information for the issuance of the DNIs mysteriously were lost.36\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 342, quotation from a note from Imaging Automation.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 344-345 and footnotes 402 and 403.\n\n170.\n\nSiemens maintains that the source code issue lacks any merit. First, source codes were excluded from the Contract. The Government, prompted by a question of SITS seeking confirmation that the only right to be acquired by the Ministry of the Interior over the software would be a nonexclusive use license, replied: \"The requirement included in the bidding terms and conditions related to the software is that the Ministry of the Interior be transferred a permanent and non-exclusive use license \", and \"the bidder or contractor may assign all or a portion of the ownership rights over the software if it so accepted.\"37 Siemens affirms that there is no reference in the Contract to software source codes and, to have access to them, Argentina would need to negotiate directly with the software copyright owners.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 353, emphasis added by the Claimant.\n\n171.\n\nSiemens recalls that software and source codes are protected by Argentine law and international law and that no third party has the right to access, reproduce, execute, adapt and modify them without the copyright holder\u2019s express authorization.\n\n172.\n\nSiemens notes that the Respondent never demanded compliance with Article 10.12 of the Contract prior to this arbitration. As the evidence attached to the Counter-Memorial shows, this article was invoked by Argentina for the first time in April 2002, nearly a year after Contract termination and after the provision had lost its effect. Furthermore, the allegation made by Argentina that defects had been detected in the System that require access to the source codes to be corrected is an argument first made by Argentina in its Counter-Memorial.\n\n**4. Rejoinder**\n----------------\n\n173.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina points out that it is striking that, notwithstanding the contractual concerns expressed by Siemens in this arbitration, it never saw fit to initiate the dispute settlement provisions set out in Article 30 of the Contract. Argentina emphasizes the seriousness of the breaches of the Contract by SITS, and that Siemens agreed to renegotiate the Contract and to the application of the 2000 Emergency Law to the renegotiation. Siemens was aware of the consequences of renegotiating under that law. Argentina explains that the final proposal was prepared after receiving the opinions of the General Department of Legal Affairs of the Ministry of the Interior and of SIGEN. Argentina also points out that the delay in compensation can be attributed to institutional changes but also to the lack of cooperation of SITS with the Asset Reception Committee.\n\n174.\n\nArgentina clarifies that it is true that Siemens won the bid on the basis of Siemens\u2019 qualifications as technology leader but the System failed to perform the task identifying and registering individuals pursuant to Law No. 17,671. Argentina affirms that the FOM was never approved and hence the System never existed, only some functions worked.\n\n175.\n\nArgentina questions the political motivations alleged by the Claimant at each step of the way. Argentina points out that the FOM approval process already showed before the change of Government that SITS lacked the technical expertise required. The FOM was approved on November 26, 1999, subject to the observations made by RNP, and Argentina allowed SITS to start printing the DNIs beforehand so that SITS could recover its investment. As regards the External Circuit, Argentina clarifies that it was refused by the Provinces because of economic reasons, that it would have been irresponsible to oblige the Provinces considering how onerous the model was and the impossibility of continuing efficiently with the development of the Project, and that SITS agreed with the Government on November 26, 1999 to empower the project coordinator of RNP and the project manager of SITS, together with the Provincial Directors of Vital Records, to amend the schedules of implementation, composition and size of the Electronic Data Collection Centers and established December 20, 1999 as the deadline for implementation.\n\n176.\n\nArgentina dismisses the contention that no budgetary allocations were made and refers to pertinent provisions of the budget laws for 1999, 2000 and 2001, and alleges that it would have been irresponsible on the part of Argentina to use the budget to develop a faulty product.\n\n177.\n\nArgentina maintains that the manual system to issue DNIs could not be suspended because the System as such never worked. The mistake detected by Argentine police officers was not a minor mistake; it was a major design error in the sub-system. The DNM component also failed; it was installed in less than 10% of the places and presented gross validation mistakes. Argentina argues that SITS failed to bring any action against the measures taken and only objected to Decree 669/01 and then for reasons different from those adduced here.\n\n178.\n\nArgentina insists that Article 17 of the Contract referred only to errors related to the physical support and not to the design of the software, that it was essential for the Government to secure the continuation of the System, that the interruption was not a penalty, and that the mistake in the fingerprint did not give rise to the revision of the Contract.\n\n179.\n\nArgentina observes that Siemens has not objected to any of the safety-related questions in the report of SIGEN; it simply asserts that it was not notified. In respect of the date when the report was issued, Argentina dismisses the point made by Siemens since surely a report needs some time to be prepared and the date of the report is the date of its completion. Furthermore, Argentina notes that SITS was aware of the preparation of the report since its representatives attended the audit meetings organized by SIGEN.\n\n180.\n\nArgentina asserts that at no time has it affirmed that the Contract was rescinded by the Contractor\u2019s fault. The reports of the various agencies were used to revise the Contract but the rescission was done under the 2000 Emergency Law. Argentina alleges that it did not inform SITS of any breaches nor imposed any sanctions because it was its intention to preserve the Contract and affirms that at all times it acknowledged that the rescission was a consequence of the economic and financial emergency.\n\n181.\n\nArgentina affirms that it does not confuse the emergency of 2000 with that of 2002; the circumstances detected in 1999, which gave rise to the 2000 Emergency Law, are the background to the crisis that burst in December 2001. Argentina asserts that the two crises are linked, contrary to the argument made by Siemens.\n\n182.\n\nArgentina explains that the Commission had no power to reach agreement with SITS and, therefore, it could not commit or oblige the State. Argentina describes the Contract Restatement Proposal prepared by the Commission as an internal preparatory document indicating SITS\u2019 point of view.\n\n183.\n\nArgentina further explains that the report of SIGEN was an internal report of the Administration, and that due to their importance and effects some documents are published on its website. Thus there is nothing surprising that SITS learned of its existence that way rather than through a formal notice. Argentina understands the business reasons for SITS\u2019 disagreement with the changes resulting from SIGEN\u2019s report, but it does not understand the refusal of SITS to reveal its cost structure which would have assisted the Government in finding a more rapid and favorable solution for the parties.\n\n184.\n\nArgentina takes issue with the statements by Siemens that only Siemens was required to do its part in aid of the shared sacrifice principle. To maintain the Contract as Argentina tried to do, adapting it to the economic circumstances of Argentina and its population represented a cost to Argentina over simply letting the Contract collapse.\n\n185.\n\nArgentina argues that, when the Claimant did not accept 10 of the 21 points in the Draft Proposal, Argentina concluded that the points accepted by SITS were not sufficient to meet its savings expectations, and that Siemens may not argue now that it did not reject the proposal and that the State frustrated the Contract. Argentina recalls that SITS was informed that the 2000 Emergency Law had passed and that the Contract should not be excluded from it since the Contract was not a privatization contract, and affirms that the purpose of Argentina, when it included the Contract under the 2000 Emergency Law, was not to rescind the Contract but rather to reach an agreement that guaranteed its survival. According to Argentina, Resolution Ml No. 1779/00 was clear in stating that the proposal made to the Contractor could be modified by the Contractor, but in such case the Government could reject the modification and rescind the Contract.\n\n186.\n\nArgentina recalls that the System never reached the C2 Security Level required under Annex II, Appendix I of the Contract for the configuration installed in the Document Production Centre (\"DPC\") and the Central Scanning Center. Argentina explains that SIGEN security reports in respect of the RPN and DNM were started by SIGEN on December 21, 2000, and February 21, 2001, respectively. The reports show that the Contract needed to be revised and redrafted not only because of errors in the design related to printing of fingerprints but also because of failures in IT security. Argentina explains that, because the Contract was rescinded under the 2000 Emergency Law and not for non-performance reasons, it was not necessary to have the final conclusions of the three audits carried out by SIGEN. On the other hand, according to Argentina, the SIGEN audits are a relevant element to bear in mind for the appraisal of property and equipment delivered by SITS upon termination of the Contract.\n\n187.\n\nArgentina argues that the scope of the audit conducted by Pistrelli was limited because of its terms and the time when it took place, and may not be used validly to refute the recourse to SIGEN. Pistrelli\u2019s audit was in the nature of desk work and could analyze the System only in a preliminary phase because it had not started to operate as a whole. On the other hand, affirms Argentina, SIGEN carried out an integral audit after the System operated and the Project was halted due to a mistake in its design. Argentina recalls that RPN criticized the Pistrelli audit and requested elaboration of a number of points and that, as of April 17, 2000, the authorities had not been able to prove whether the security changes requested by RPN had been incorporated.\n\n188.\n\nArgentina observes that SITS refused to participate every time tests were carried out in spite of several invitations made by the Government. Argentina also points out that SITS refused to participate in the asset reception process notwithstanding official invitations to this effect. Thus SITS did not participate in the physical cross-checking, operative cross-checking or performance cross-checking because: (i) the inventories of assets already furnished contained accurate specifications, and (ii) since termination of the Contract it had not been in charge of the operation of the System, did not have access to the equipment and did not know the physical and operative situation.\n\n189.\n\nArgentina acknowledges that SITS has the right to compensation and that it has taken all the measures leading to satisfy it.\n\n190.\n\nArgentina confirms that the contractual performance bond has not been returned because there has been no compliance of SITS with Article 10.12 of the Contract regarding deposit of the source codes and with Article 10.7 regarding the delivery of licenses for the use of applications software. According to Argentina, the return of the performance bond is not required until the Asset Reception Committee issues a decision as to compliance by SITS with its contractual obligations.\n\n191.\n\nArgentina maintains that the agreements between SITS and the sub-contractors have been transferred to the State and that the amount to be paid is included in the amount of compensation assessed by the TTN.\n\n192.\n\nArgentina takes exception to the allegation that it has not been diligent in respect of the transfer of the non-exclusive licenses and the satellite links. Argentina contends that the licenses have not been delivered because delivery was subject by SITS to prior payment by the Government. As regards the assignment of satellite links, it was the choice of Argentina to continue or not with the same provider.\n\n193.\n\nArgentina rebuts the statements of Siemens on the test of Casa *de Moneda.* In the first place, the test was conducted outside the asset reception process and there was no reason to invite SITS since the Contract by then had been terminated. Furthermore, Argentina affirms that the test was not as successful as the Claimant pretends since documents were printed only and not produced and, even with the assistance of sub-contractors, it was not possible to make the System work appropriately.\n\n194.\n\nArgentina then turns to the source codes issue and re-affirms that the codes were necessary for the purpose of determining the extent of compliance by SITS with its obligations within the framework of the 2000 Emergency Law and Resolution ME No. 3/2001. Argentina also questions the statement of Siemens that Argentina had never raised the issue of compliance with Article 10.12. Argentina in fact requested the source codes at the request of the TTN and SITS breached Article 10.12 by not providing them. Argentina explains that the value of the source codes has been included in the assessment carried out by the TTN.\n\n**VI. Merits of the Dispute**\n-----------------------------\n\n195.\n\nArgentina has based its defense on its submission that the claim of Siemens is grounded on issues of contractual performance, while Siemens maintains that its claim is based on breaches of the Treaty, including the breach of the umbrella clause - Article 7(2) of the Treaty. The Tribunal will address this question first and, before turning its attention to the other specific claims related to expropriation, fair and equitable treatment, and arbitrary and discriminatory measures, it will consider the relevance of SITS\u2019 and Siemens\u2019 agreement to the Contract Restatement Proposal and alleged agreement of SITS and Siemens to include the revision of the Contract under the framework of the 2000 Emergency Law.\n\n**1. Umbrella Clause**\n----------------------\n\n**a) Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe Tribunal will start by recalling the specific arguments of the parties on the meaning of Article 7(2) of the Treaty. This article reads as follows:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it has assumed with regard to investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party in its territory.\"\n\n197.\n\nSiemens argues that Argentina breached Article 7(2) of the Treaty by failing to comply with its obligations with regard to Siemens\u2019 investment. According to Siemens, such obligations may be contractual obligations in agreements between States and investors or broader undertakings contained in the States\u2019 national investment legislation. The effect of Article 7(2) is to protect investments against interferences with contractual rights and licenses elevating them to violations of the Treaty regardless of breaches of Articles 2 and 4. Siemens observes that this conclusion is even more compelling if the State does so in bad faith, for political reasons and lacking public purpose. Siemens also finds that this conclusion is confirmed by Article 10(1), which covers all \"[d]isputes concerning investments in the sense of this Treaty between a Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contacting Party [...].\"\n\n198.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Argentina reviews the history of the umbrella clauses and in particular refers to the concept of the essential base of the claim introduced in *Woodruff v. Venezuela38* and used in *Vivendi II* for purposes of determining the validity of the forum choice in the contract. Argentina finds further support in its argumentation in *Ronald S. Lauder v. the Czech Republic39, Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. the Republic of Estonia40, CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* 41 and SGS *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan.42* In the latter case, Argentina points out that the tribunal insisted that the text of the clause has to be unambiguous and that there must be clear and convincing evidence of the purpose of the umbrella clause to elevate contractual claims to treaty claims. Argentina also finds support in SGS *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines* since both SGS tribunals were moved by the goal of preventing the transformation of contractual claims into international claims.\n\n*Woodruff v. Venezuela,* RIAA, Vol. IX, p. 213, AL RA No. 72.\n\n*Ronald S. Lauder v. the Czech Republic,* Award (September 3, 2001), published in www.mfcr.cz/Arbitraz/en/FinalAward.doc, Siemens LA No. 6.\n\n*Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. the Republic of Estonia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award (June 25, 2001), AL RA No. 73.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award (May 12, 2005), AL RA No. 64.\n\nSGS *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 18 ICSID Review 307, para. 163, AL RA No. 74.\n\n199.\n\nArgentina points out that the tribunal in SGS *v. Philippines* restricts the commitments to which the clause is applicable: \"For Article X(2) to be applicable, the host State must have assumed a legal obligation, and it must have been assumed vis-\u00e0-vis the specific investment - not as a matter of the application of some legal obligation of a general character. This is very far from elevating to the international level all \u2018the municipal, legislative or administrative or other unilateral measures of a Contracting Party.\"43 Furthermore, according to Argentina, if there is an exclusive contractual forum selection clause, the forum specified in the contract is the forum with jurisdiction over contractual matters.\n\nSGS *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/10, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction (January 29, 2004), para. 121, cited In the Counter-Memorial, para. 1039.\n\n200.\n\nApplying these considerations to the instant case, Argentina argues that \"the clause can only be invoked vis-\u00e0-vis an Investment Agreement in the case of breach of the Agreement and not *vis-\u00e0-vis* a concession contract governed by domestic administrative law and containing an agreed upon forum clause. Siemens intentionally confuses the Investment Agreement with the investment, terms that are not equivalent and cannot be merged.\"44\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 1047.\n\n201.\n\nIn its Reply, Siemens affirms that Article 7(2) includes obligations arising from a contract. Siemens finds that the attempt by Argentina to distinguish between an investment agreement and domestic utility contracts has no support under the terms of investment treaties or in their ordinary meaning. Siemens points out that Articles 7(2) and 10(1) use the term \"investments\", which is broadly defined and that claims raised under an umbrella clause are additional to and independent of claims based on the other protections under the Treaty. According to Siemens, under an umbrella clause, \"any violation of a contract thus covered, becomes a violation of the BIT. The consequence is that the BIT\u2019S clause on dispute settlement becomes applicable to a claim arising from the breach of the contract.\"45\n\nReply, para. 591, citing Professor Schreuer\u2019s legal opinion.\n\n202.\n\nSiemens argues that case law supports its claims under article 7(2) of the Treaty. First, it refers to the criticism of the SGS **v. Pakistan** in SGS *v. Philippines* which termed that decision unconvincing because it failed to give any clear meaning to the umbrella clause. Siemens points out that the facts of the instant case are different because SGS **v. Pakistan** did not involve any allegation of sovereign interference with the Contract. Second, Siemens recalls the conclusion of the tribunal in the Philippines case: \"[the umbrella clause] makes it a breach of the BIT for the host state to fail to observe binding commitments, including contractual commitments, which it has assumed with regard to specific investments.\"46 Third, Siemens rebuts the argument of Argentina that a more specific provision shall take precedence over a more general one. Relying on the opinion of Professor Christoph Schreuer, Siemens contends that this argument in fact favors Siemens\u2019 position:\n\n\"The dispute settlement clause in the BIT is merely a standing offer to investors. By accepting that offer an investor perfects a specific arbitration agreement. The ICSID arbitration agreement, as perfected through the institution of proceedings, applies only to the specific dispute. By contrast, the dispute settlement clause in the Contract refers to any dispute arising from the Contract. It follows that the ICSID arbitration agreement is the more specific one. The principle *generalia specialibus non derogant,* should work against the contractual forum selection clause and in favor of ICSID.\"47\n\nFourth, Siemens rejects the arguments on the essential claim base and the contractual forum clause for having been already rejected by the Tribunal in its decision jurisdiction.\n\nSGS *v. Philippines,* para. 128, quoted in the Reply, para. 599.\n\nLegal opinion of Professor Schreuer, quoted In the Reply, para. 603.\n\n203.\n\nArgentina in its Rejoinder denies as a primary submission that there were any breaches of its obligations towards the Claimant and, if the Tribunal would consider otherwise, then these would be a contractual matter to be determined by the proper law of the Contract and not international law. Furthermore, Argentina contests the meaning attributed by the Claimant to the umbrella clause, and points out that, in the case of SGS *v. Philippines,* the wording of the clause was different and it referred to \"specific\" investments, and that, in any case, the tribunal found that the umbrella clause did not \"convert the issue of the extent or content of such obligations into an issue of international law.\"48 Argentina explains that the case law provides very little authority to support the approach embraced by the Claimant and that SGS *v. Pakistan* and *Salini v. Jordan49* are evidence of the unwillingness of arbitral tribunals to embark on the resolution of contractual disputes. Argentina concludes by reminding the Tribunal that the approach proposed by the Claimant would re-write the Treaty, depart from the classical approach to the arbitral function under international law, and bring into play the provisions of Article 52 of the Convention.\n\nSGS *v. Philippines,* para. 128, quoted In the Rejoinder, para. 667.\n\nSGS *v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* quoted in the Rejoinder, para. 673; *Salini v. Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13, Award (January 31, 2006), quoted in the Rejoinder, para. 673.\n\n**b) Considerations of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Article 7(2) has the meaning that its terms express, namely, that failure to meet obligations undertaken by one of the Treaty parties in respect to any particular investment is converted by this clause into a breach of the Treaty. Whether an arbitral tribunal is the tribunal which has jurisdiction to consider that breach or whether it should be considered by the tribunals of the host State of the investor is a matter that this Tribunal does not need to enter. The Claimant is not a party to the Contract and SITS is not a party to these proceedings.\n\n205.\n\nIn regards to the scope of Article 10(1), the Tribunal concurs with the submission that reference to disputes related to investments would cover contractual disputes for purposes of the consent of the parties to arbitration given the wide meaning of the term \"investments\" and the terms of Article 7(2). However, to the extent that the obligations assumed by the State party are of a contractual nature, such obligations must originate in a contract between the State party to the Treaty and the foreign investor as, for instance, in the SGS cases.\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal does not subscribe to the view of the Respondent that investment agreements should be distinguished from concession agreements of an administrative nature. Such distinction has no basis in Article 7(2) of the Treaty which refers to \"any obligations\", or in the definition of \"investment\" in the Treaty. Any agreement related to an investment that qualifies as such under the Treaty would be part of the obligations covered under the umbrella clause. The Tribunal does not find significant, for purposes of the ordinary meaning of this clause, that it does not refer to \"specific\" investments. The term \"investment\" in the sense of the Treaty, linked as it is to \"any obligations\", would cover any binding commitment entered into by Argentina in respect of such investment.\n\n**2. Consent of Siemens and SITS**\n----------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThe positions of the parties related to the argument advanced by Argentina to the effect that SITS or Siemens agreed to the measures taken by Argentina have already been described. The Tribunal recalls that such argument is based on the fact that SITS and Siemens agreed to the Contract Restatement Proposal in November 2000, that no administrative appeal was filed by SITS except with respect to Decree 669/01, and that they did not object to the ministerial Resolution placing the Contract under the regime of the 2000 Emergency Law.\n\n208.\n\nAs regards the agreement to the Contract Restatement Proposal, Argentina itself contends that it was a preliminary agreement that was not binding. In any case, Argentina modified the proposal and SITS did not accept certain terms of the revised proposal. Thus it is difficult to understand how it can be held that SITS or Siemens have agreed to the Contract Restatement Proposal if its terms were not an agreement but, as argued by Argentina, an internal document in which the views of the private party were expressed and Argentina did not accept them.\n\n209.\n\nThe argument on the consent of Siemens and SITS to the application of the 2000 Emergency Law to the Contract is even more puzzling to the Tribunal. It is expected that individuals and companies will obey the law; it is not a question of choice, as would be the option to accept a negotiated proposal.\n\n210.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute between the parties as to whether Siemens or SITS did not object to the application of the 2000 Emergency Law regime to the Contract because they were led to believe by the Respondent that this would speed up the administrative processing of the Contract Restatement Proposal. Whatever the reasons for not objecting, Argentina always had the power to apply the 2000 Emergency Law to the Contract, Irrespective of the position of Siemens or SITS on the matter, and it did. It is clear from the evidence that the expectation of Siemens was that the Contract Restatement Proposal would not be modified even if this may have been possible under the 2000 Emergency Law. It would lack logic that a high official of Siemens would be received by President de la R\u00faa to plead that a decree be issued on terms different from those negotiated.\n\n211.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal considers that, for purposes of evaluating the measures taken by Argentina in light of its commitments under the Treaty, the allegations based on the consent of Siemens or SITS are not relevant.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the other specific commitments under the Treaty alleged by Siemens to have been breached by Argentina. Since the parties understand these commitments differently, not only as they apply to the facts of this case but also in their meaning, the Tribunal will describe first in respect of each commitment the arguments made by the parties on its scope and meaning.\n\n**3. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n**a) Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nSiemens argues that its investment has been expropriated indirectly as a result of measures taken by Argentina. According to Siemens, whether or not Argentina intended to expropriate its investment is irrelevant, what is of essence is the actual effect of the measures on the investors\u2019 property: \"measures that indirectly, but effectively, deprive an investor of the use or enjoyment of its investment, including the deprivation of the whole or a significant part of the economic benefit of property, are as expropriatory as the seizure of an investor\u2019s formal title to its property.\"50\n\nMemorial, para. 248.\n\n214.\n\nSiemens further argues that contractual rights and the right to complete a project are part of the property rights that may be expropriated and that government measures that frustrate such assurances and substantially deprive investors of their rights to have them respected amount to an expropriation.\n\n215.\n\nAccording to Siemens, irrespective of whether or not the purpose of a State measure affects its legality, it does not affect the State\u2019s obligation to compensate the investor promptly, adequately and effectively; as plainly stated in Article 4(2) of the Treaty, the public purpose of expropriatory measures by either State party in no way alters the legal obligation to compensate investors affected by those measures. Failure to provide prompt, adequate and effective compensation renders the expropriation unlawful whether or not it is for a public purpose.\n\n216.\n\nSiemens claims that the acts and omissions of Argentina were expropriatory measures that substantially deprived Siemens of the use and enjoyment of its investment, and significantly reduced its value without payment of any compensation. Siemens relied on the following assurances given and obligations undertaken by Argentina: (i) replacement of all DNIs previously issued by new DNIs issued through the System; (ii) discontinuation of the issuance of manual DNIs; (iii) implementation of the System on a nationwide basis; (iv) processing of immigration proceedings through the System and payment of the corresponding fees; and (v) adoption of all measures necessary to fulfill the obligations under the Contract and regular collection of SITS\u2019 revenues resulting from the fees and prices paid by the users.\n\n217.\n\nAccording to Siemens, these assurances constituted essential conditions of its investment and Argentina was aware of its meaning as recognized in the report of the Commission:\n\n\"Progressive replacement of all DNIs [...] is actually the State\u2019s guarantee rather than an obligation of the contractor, and defines the value of the contract [...]\n\n[...] the contract term, which is defined as a six-year term that may be extended for two three-year periods, prescribes a mechanism that guarantees returns on the investment made; this relates to the need to have all existing DNIs replaced by the ones dealt with in the contract [...].\"51\n\nQuoted in para. 277 of the Memorial.\n\n218.\n\nSiemens affirms that the acts and omissions of Argentina qualify as \"measures\" under Article 4(2) of the Treaty. According to Siemens, the term \"measures\" is an all encompassing term for any actions attributable to a State that may affect an investment and includes acts performed by its different organs and subdivisions. In the case of its investment, Siemens refers to the following measures that resulted eventually in its expropriation:\n\n(i) From the date of execution of the Contract and up to August 1999 Argentina failed to meet the obligations it had undertaken to allow the performance of the Contract on schedule; it did not make the necessary budget allocations, it did not provide the funds and human resources necessary to make the system operational, it delayed approval of the FOM, it failed to execute agreements with the Provinces, and it did not adopt the statutory and executive measures necessary to carry out the replacement of existing DNIs by those issued through the System.\n\n(ii) Argentina pressed SITS into postponing the initial date for DNI production because of the then upcoming elections and into agreeing to postpone until January 31, 2000 discontinuation of the manual issuance of DNIs.\n\n(iii) Argentina failed: (A) to adopt alternative measures to implement the System throughout its territory even when the RNP had the exclusive power to issue the DNIs and gather the information to produce them, (B) to provide budget allocations for the Project for the year 2000, (C) to provide the technical definitions to complete implementation of the immigration proceedings system and the imposition of new requirements not included in the new Project, and (D) to provide the facilities to implement the External Circuit to extend the System throughout the national territory.\n\n(iv) Argentina notified Siemens in January 2000 that it intended to reduce the originally agreed-upon prices in the Contract and that agreement to the reduction was a condition for the continuation of the Contract and, in February 2000, unjustifiably halted immigration processing and DNI production through the System.\n\n(v) The negotiations that ensued were concluded in November 2000 with the promise that the System\u2019s revenue-generating operations would immediately resume, and to speed approval of the new contractual terms the Contract was subjected to the Emergency Law of 2000. Notwithstanding assurances of the President of the Republic that a decree would be issued approving the new terms before the end of the year, the new terms were never approved.\n\n(vi) New terms were proposed by Argentina in May 2001 on a take it or leave it basis without providing the basic elements for an evaluation of the proposal. The new proposal was not acceptable to SITS, which indicated its willingness to consider alternatives. Argentina terminated the Contract on May 18, 2001 invoking the power granted under the 2000 Emergency Law and without reference to any technical or other reason related to the fulfillment of the Contract by SITS.\n\n(vii) After termination of the Contract, Argentina failed to pay compensation, although it had acknowledged its obligation to do so, denied the right of defense to SITS when SITS filed an appeal against Decree 669/01, failed to receive the equipment, facilities and instruments used in Project execution, and refused to return the Contract performance bond although it was mandatory to return it at Contract termination.\n\n(viii) Siemens\u2019 investment was the only foreign investment expropriated under the 2000 Emergency Law and the public purpose invoked to terminate the Contract was merely an excuse to legitimize the measure adopted by the Government for political convenience, since economic studies carried out by the Ministry of Economy had recommended renegotiation of the terms agreed by the parties.\n\n219.\n\nSiemens concludes by affirming that the aggregate of these measures amounts to a creeping expropriation of its investment and submits that, notwithstanding that Argentina\u2019s conduct constitutes a case of creeping expropriation, it seems reasonable to consider May 18, 2001, the date of Decree 669/01, as the date of expropriation for valuation purposes. Siemens adds that the Treaty states that the value of an investment for purposes of compensation is determined by reference to the date before the intention to expropriate became known, and, therefore, the effects of the taking itself and any act related to the taking, including threats to take the asset concerned, that may have diminished the value of the property or enterprise on the date of the taking, shall not be considered in the valuation and that Siemens is entitled to compensation for any loss suffered before or after May 18, 2001 caused by Argentina\u2019s creeping expropriation.\n\n220.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Argentina denies that it expropriated Siemens\u2019 investment and draws the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the following sentence of Article 4(2) of the Treaty: \"The legality of the expropriation, nationalization or similar measure, and the amount of the indemnification should be reviewable through ordinary legal proceedings.\" Based on this sentence, Argentina asserts that it is entitled to apply this review option to any future decision of the Tribunal in connection with the alleged expropriation.\n\n221.\n\nArgentina challenges the qualification of events by Siemens. It is Argentina\u2019s contention that for events to lead to an expropriation each one of them should affect the investment adversely. However, when the main feature of a contract is to provide one set of goods -the System in the instant case-, it is not possible to speak of successive acts, either the Contract is thwarted or not. Argentina argues that Siemens is unable to provide evidence that the alleged expropriatory events affected the investment adversely. In this respect, Argentina refers to the statement of Siemens that it agreed to renegotiate the Contract not only to save it but also because the Government had promised to resume the System\u2019s operation. This means, according to Argentina, that the Contract would not have been thwarted and there could not be a creeping expropriation. Argentina finds support for its line of argument in *Generation Ukraine, Inc. v.* *Ukraine,* which admitted difficulty in finding many cases that fall under the creeping expropriation category and stated:\n\n\"A plea of creeping expropriation must proceed on the basis that the investment existed at a particular point in time and that subsequent acts attributable to the State have eroded the investor\u2019s rights to its investment to an extent that is violative of the relevant international standard of protection against expropriation.\"52\n\n*Generation Ukraine, Inc. v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award (September 16, 2003), para. 20.26, quotation In the Counter-Memorial, para. 911.\n\n222.\n\nArgentina then develops the argument that Siemens\u2019 claim is a purely contractual claim and international law does not include regulations on contracts, as acknowledged in *Saudi Arabia v. Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian & Ellen Baca v. The United Mexican States53,* and by Professor Brownlie54. Furthermore, Siemens has not contributed evidence showing, as stated by the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi II,* clear conduct contrary to the relevant standard in the circumstances of the case. Argentina disputes the relevance of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal case law because the law applicable to the cases before that tribunal is different from the law applicable in this arbitration. That tribunal has to rule on contractual disputes, can apply commercial usages and has highly discretionary powers in deciding the applicable law. Argentina reminds the Tribunal that the applicability of the legal principles developed by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal was explicitly rejected in *Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Canada55* and *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. The Government of Canada56* Argentina also argues in detail the inapplicability to the instant case of holdings by the tribunals adduced by Siemens regarding acquired international rights: (i) *Aramco* was concerned with the application of international law to a contract that included its own stabilization clause, (ii) *Revere Cooper & Brass,* *Inc. v. Overseas Private Investment Corporation57* was a classic investment agreement protecting the investment differently from an investment treaty and it was internationalized by a stabilization clause, (iii) *Antoine Goetz et consorts v. Republic of Burundi58* was concerned with the revocation of a permit to operate in a free trade zone, (iv) *CME Czech Republic B. V. (the Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic59* was not concerned with contractual guarantees by a State, and (v) the findings of *CME* were contradicted by *Lauder.*\n\n*Saudi Arabia v. Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), 27* I.L.R. 117, 165, AL RA No. 45; *Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian & Ellen Baca v.

The Czech Republic,* Partial Award (September 13, 2001).\n\n223.\n\nArgentina questions how Siemens has drawn the line to delimit the State\u2019s legitimate actions from actions entitling an investor to compensation. Argentina argues that, if the effect of depriving a person of its property is the criterion for this purpose, then any regulation would be expropriatory because regulations have a damaging effect on regulated parties. Argentina refers to the proportionality test advanced by *Tecmed* between the measures taken and the public interest pursued by them, and to the deference due to the State when it defines issues of public policy. Thus this requires a more complex analysis than proposed by Siemens.\n\n224.\n\nArgentina finds support in recent arbitral awards - *Consortium RFCC v. Royaume du Maroc60, Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States61, Generation Ukraine, SGS v. Philippines -* for arguing that a breach of treaty is not a breach of contract, it is not enough to qualify a contractual breach as a treaty violation, there should be a reasonable effort by the investor to obtain compensation through the domestic channels under the law applicable to the contract, and the State should not have used its sovereign powers to amend preexisting legal situations and the parties\u2019 rights and obligations. In this respect, Argentina affirms that:\n\n\"(a) it did not act under its *ius imperii* powers; (b) it terminated the contract with SITS under the habitual and ordinary forms provided therefor by Argentine law; (c) such act did not thwart any right granted to the investor or its affiliate under the law of the Contract; and (d) after the termination of the Contract it was not engaged in any acts aimed at thwarting the rights agreed upon with SITS for the termination.\"62\n\n*Consortium RFCC v. Royaume du Maroc,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/6, Award (December 22, 2003), para. 38 (AL RA 60), cited in the Counter-Memorial, para. 972.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award (April 30, 2004), para. 171 (AL RA 61).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 969.\n\n225.\n\nArgentina also affirms that, like the Philippines in the SGS case, it had \"not issued any act (law or decree in sovereign function) aimed at disregarding the possible contractual rights of SITS. Should there be any debt, it would still exist.\"63\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 986.\n\n226.\n\nArgentina requests the Tribunal to focus on two aspects of *Generation Ukraine.* First, arbitral tribunals do not exercise the function of an administrative review agency. Second, arbitral tribunals should consider the changes in the economy of the State hosting the investments when assessing the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. Argentina also calls the attention of the Tribunal to the holding in *Waste Management II,* to the effect that international expropriation law is not meant to eliminate the ordinary risk assumed by foreign investors, and to the fact that, under the Contract, SITS took responsibility for the business risk.\n\n227.\n\nArgentina denies that it gave Siemens any warranty or profitability assurance, and claims that Siemens agreed to revise the Contract when faced with the failure of the essential features of the System and the substantial alteration of the economic conditions under which the Contract was intended to be carried out. Argentina contends that Siemens must comply with the Contract before requesting its fulfillment and lists as breaches of the Contract concealed from the Tribunal the following: delay in the design of the FOM and the Security Operating Model, the imperfect designs for the Security Operating Model, the External Data Capture Circuit and fingerprint taking, ignorance of the Argentine personal identification system, failure to deliver the source codes, vulnerability of the System, and the hindrances placed by SITS during the entire reception process, including its refusal to participate.\n\n228.\n\nIn any case, pleads Argentina, even if the arguments of Argentina were rejected, the mere \"effect\" criterion applied by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal would not result in an expropriatory effect of the alleged actions of Argentina under Argentine law applicable to the Contract.\n\n229.\n\nIn its Reply, Siemens rejects the allegation of Argentina that, under Article 4(2), it has the right to submit to review before the local courts the potential award of this Tribunal. Siemens explains that this Article grants the investor, who is the only party affected by the expropriation measures, the right to challenge the legality of the expropriation and the amount of the compensation in ordinary judicial proceedings.\n\n230.\n\nSiemens then questions the definition of expropriation used by Argentina in its allegations, namely, that expropriation may occur only directly or through measures that autonomously and independently affect the investment adversely, that deprivation of or substantial interference with contractual rights does not constitute an expropriation under international law, and that the effect of the measure should completely thwart the investment or be unreasonable,\n\n231.\n\nSiemens notes that the Treaty includes measures tantamount to expropriation and explains that provisions on indirect expropriation are usually generic statements given the great variety of possible measures. Siemens refers to the findings by the tribunals in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. The Republic of Costa Rica,64 CME, Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States,65 Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v. TAMS-AFFA Consulting Engineers of Iran,66 Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co.* S.A. *v. Arab Republic of Egypt67* and *Tecmed* to show the endorsement of the notion of indirect expropriation by arbitral tribunals; such expropriation takes place by a variety of measures that by themselves would not necessarily be expropriatory or adversely affect the investment, nor would they need to be intended to be expropriatory. Siemens refers to scholarly opinion on the notion of creeping expropriation:\n\n\"In some, if not most other, creeping expropriations, however, that intent [to expropriate], though possibly present at some level of the host state\u2019s government, will be difficult, if not impossible to discern. Discrete acts, analyzed in isolation rather than in the context of the overall flow of events, may, whether legal or not in themselves, seem innocuous vis-\u00e0-vis a potential expropriation. Some may not be expropriatory in themselves. Only in retrospect will it become evident that those acts comprised part of an accretion of deleterious acts and omissions, which in the aggregate expropriated the foreign investor\u2019s property rights.\"68\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v.

Ghana Investments Centre*,69 Tradex Hellas S.A. v. Republic of Albania,70 Santa Elena, Tecmed, Generation Ukraine and Iran-US Claims Tribunal jurisprudence shows that expropriatory measures that take place step by step should be analyzed in their aggregate effects and not \"autonomously and independently\" as argued by Argentina. Siemens concludes that the termination of the Contract was not the only expropriatory step but the last of a clear chain of measures taken by Argentina since 1999 that destroyed the value of Siemens\u2019 investment.\n\n*Biloune and Marine Drive Complex Ltd. v. Ghana Investments Centre,* Award on Jurisdiction and Liability (October 27, 1989), 95 Int\u2019l Law Reports (1994), 184, at pa. 210-11, Claimant\u2019s Legal Authorities No. 35, cited In the Memorial, para. 372.\n\n*Tradex Hellas S.A. v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case, No. ARB/94/2, Award (April 29, 1999).\n\n233.\n\nSiemens disputes Argentina\u2019s assertion that there cannot be expropriation following contractual breaches and repudiation of the Contract. Siemens refers to the opinion of Professor Schreuer, who states that:\n\n\"[...] the mere fact that the investment was made on the basis of a contract does not preclude a violation of the BIT [the Treaty], Nor does an allegation of contract violations mean that a BIT claim cannot arise from the same facts. The standards are simply different. It is incumbent upon the Claimant to demonstrate a violation of the BIT. This task is not made impossible or more onerous by the simultaneous existence of contract violations.\"71\n\nReply, para. 433.\n\n234.\n\nSiemens further disputes the argument that, when a contract is subject to a domestic legal system, expropriation of rights under the contract would be precluded. Siemens maintains that the law governing a particular contract and whether contractual rights may be expropriated are two distinct and unrelated questions; contractual rights may be expropriated as tangible property may be expropriated. Siemens also questions the argument that a contract cannot be governed by international law unless it contains a stabilization clause: \"the decisive point is that the absence of a stabilization clause does not mean that the contract cannot be the object of an expropriation. The expropriation of rights under a contract containing a stabilization clause would merely give rise to an additional claim for violation of that clause.\"72\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 438, quotation from Professor Schreuer\u2019s legal opinion.\n\n235.\n\nSiemens recalls that Article 1 of the Treaty defines as protected investments \"every kind of asset\" and specifically \"rights to funds used to create economic value or to any performance with an economic value\" and \"concessions conferred by public law entities.\" Siemens alleges that judicial practice unanimously supports a wide concept of property that includes rights under contract, e.g., the decisions in *Rudloff73, Norwegian Shipowners74, Factory at Chorzow75,* and the case law of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal.\n\n*Rudloff Case,* Interlocutory Decision, 1903, 9 Reports of International Arbitral Awards (RIAA) 244, 250 (1959), Legal Authorities 40, quoted in the Reply, para. 442.\n\n*Norwegian Shipowners\u2019 Claims (Norway v. United States),* Award (October 13, 1922), 1 *RIAA* 307, p. 325.\n\n*Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v. Poland),* Judgment (May 25, 1926), *PCIJ Series A, No.* 7, p. 44.\n\n236.\n\nAccording to Siemens, a breach of contract or actions affecting contract rights may constitute an expropriation when: (i) the breach consists of one or part of a series of acts that combine to effect a creeping expropriation; (ii) the breach is of such fundamental nature that it goes to the heart of the promised performance and adversely affects the continuance of the project concerned; (iii) regulatory conduct denies contract rights or requires their alteration; (iv) specific contract rights or rights under a contract as a whole are repudiated, and (iv) a stabilization clause is breached. Siemens affirms that most of these situations apply in the instant case.\n\n237.\n\nAs regards the argument that Argentina did not act in its sovereign capacity, Siemens finds the argument implausible given termination of the Contract by decree, rejection of the appeal by decree, and termination based not on contractual grounds but on the 2000 Emergency Law. Furthermore, Argentina has argued that a decisive reason for the termination was that a substantial number of Provinces refused to participate in the implementation of the Project.\n\n238.\n\nSiemens explains that the purpose of the measures is not a criterion to determine whether an expropriation has occurred. Under Article 4(2) of the Treaty, public purpose is a criterion for the expropriation\u2019s legality, \"Similarly, proportionality and reasonableness may play a role in assessing whether the power to expropriate has been exercised properly. But these criteria do not affect the question whether an expropriation exists or not.\"76 Commenting on the cases relied on by Argentina, Siemens observes that they relate to regulatory takings, while Siemens was deprived of its investment through measures taken directly against it and not through regulatory measures.\n\nReply, para. 465, quotation from Professor Schreuer\u2019s legal opinion.\n\n239.\n\nSiemens rejects the argument that it needed to seek prior recourse through domestic channels and observes that this is an attempt to reintroduce an argument already put forward at the jurisdictional stage. Siemens explains that, under Article 26 of the Convention, the Contracting Parties waive the local remedies rule unless they state otherwise, which Argentina has not done and, in any case, SITS and the Claimant made every reasonable effort to obtain correction of Argentina\u2019s measures through domestic means, including an administrative appeal against Decree 669/01. Contrary to the factual situation in the cases of *Waste Management II* and *Generation Ukraine* adduced by Argentina, in the instant case Siemens\u2019 loss is persistent, irreparable, caused by the Government and not by low-level officials whose acts of maladministration might easily be corrected.\n\n240.\n\nSiemens also dismisses the argument that it may not be entitled to claim under the Treaty because it allegedly failed to perform its own obligations. Siemens observes that Article 4(2) does not impose any duty with regard to the investor; there is no defense based on the failure to comply with the other party\u2019s duties.\n\n241.\n\nArgentina in its Rejoinder affirms that Siemens fails to draw the line between a contractual breach and the expropriation of an agreement, and clarifies that it referred to *Waste Management II* in its argument because the tribunal in that case established criteria for expropriation of an agreement, namely, an effective repudiation of the property rights of the investor which prevents it from exercising them entirely or to a substantial extent, and not redressed by remedies available to the claimant. Argentina emphasizes the reasonableness of the measures taken as part of the expropriation concept and as held by the European Court of Human Rights and *Tecmed.*\n\n242.\n\nArgentina contends that the measures were taken under the usual and ordinary forms of terminating an agreement and Siemens failed to reply to its arguments and focused instead on whether the measures were taken in the exercise of its *ius imperium.* Argentina insists that there is a requirement of making a reasonable effort on the part of the investor to obtain correction in the domestic jurisdiction, and that this is a substantive requirement to distinguish between an act of maladministration from an act which constitutes an expropriation, \"not because there is a requirement of *exhaustion* of local remedies but because the very reality of conduct tantamount to expropriation is doubtful in the absence of a *reasonable -* not necessarily exhaustive - effort by the investor to obtain correction.\"77 In this respect, Argentina argues that SITS failed to comply with its essential duties and agreed to re-negotiate the Contract to conform to the fiscal possibilities of the State and the pocketbook of the people.\n\n*Generation Ukraine,* para. 20.30, quoted in Rejoinder para. 544.\n\n243.\n\nArgentina takes issue with the contention of Siemens that the defense of non-performance does not apply because investors may assert their rights under the Treaty. Argentina argues that the exception *non adimpleti contractus* is equally a principle of international law. Argentina maintains that the conditions set in *Waste Management II* for contract expropriation are not met in this case. According to Argentina, the actions taken before Decree 699/01 were in response to technical errors and failures to deliver on the part of SITS and its sub-contractors. Argentina insists that the termination of the Contract by Decree 669/01 was not only based on economic considerations but also on technical grounds after receiving independent advice. Therefore, Decree 669/01 was a legitimate, rational and proportionate response to a disappointing and inadequate performance of SITS\u2019 contractual obligations; it was not an expropriatory measure since \"[i]t left intact the Claimant\u2019s contractual rights, and in particular the ability to have recourse to the national courts of Argentina to challenge acts of its contractual partner which it considered to have breached the Contract.\"78\n\nRejoinder, para. 571.\n\n244.\n\nArgentina further develops the argument that investment treaties are not a guarantee of profits to foreign investors and contends that if Decree 669/01 were to be considered expropriatory by the Tribunal, then the expropriation is a lawful expropriation because \"it was a reasonable and proportionate response to a national fiscal crisis; it was carried out for a public purpose; it was not discriminatory on national or any grounds; and the decree contained within its terms provision for compensating SITS for cancellation of the Contract.\"79 Argentina explains that there were at least two major public policy reasons for the termination of the Contract: the massive fiscal crisis which necessitated cutting back projects involving a high level of public expenditure, and the inability or unwillingness of a substantial number of Provinces to participate in the Project given the fiscal crisis.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 572.\n\n**b) Considerations of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nBefore considering the arguments dealing with expropriation proper, the Tribunal will address the issue of contractual claims as opposed to treaty claims which has been argued by the parties in the context of the asserted breach of Article 4(2) and also of Article 7(2) (the umbrella clause). Subsequently, the Tribunal will discuss whether under Article 4(2) the findings of this Tribunal are subject to review by the ordinary courts, whether each individual measure in a creeping expropriation needs to be considered autonomously, whether the proper law of the Contract is relevant for purposes of expropriation, whether intent of the State to expropriate is necessary or only the effects of the State\u2019s measures need to be considered, whether an expropriation has taken place, and, if so, whether it conformed with the Treaty requirements.\n\n**i) Treaty claims and Contract Claims**\n----------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nArgentina has argued that at no time in the course of the dispute with SITS it took measures that could be regarded as an exercise of its police powers as a State, including when it terminated the Contract under the 2000 Emergency Law. The Tribunal considers that Argentina\u2019s view of when a State acts *iure imperii* is exceedingly narrow and inconsistent with the arguments advanced by Argentina itself.\n\n247.\n\nThe distinction between acts *iure imperii* and *iure gestionis* has its origins in the area of immunity of the State under international law and it differentiates between acts of a commercial nature and those which pertain to the powers of a State acting as such. Usually States have been restrictive in their understanding of which activities would not be covered by their immunity in judicial proceedings before the courts of another State. Here we have the reverse situation where the State party posits a wide content of the notion of *iure gestionis.*\n\n248.\n\nIn applying this distinction in the realm of investor-State arbitration, arbitral tribunals have considered that, for the behavior of the State as party to a contract to be considered a breach of an investment treaty, such behavior must be beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt and involve State interference with the operation of the contract:\n\n\" Pour qu\u2019il y ait droit \u00e0 compensation il faut que la personne de l\u2019expropri\u00e9 prouve qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de mesures prises par l\u2019Etat agissant non comme cocontractant mais comme autorit\u00e9 publique.

Or un Etat cocontractant n\u2019 \u2018interf\u00e8re\u2019 pas, mais \u2018ex\u00e9cute\u2019 un contrat.

Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No.ARB/00/6, Award (December 22, 2003), para. 65.\n\n249.\n\n*Waste Management II* distinguished a number of categories to determine whether it was faced with a matter of contract non-performance or expropriation. In the first category are those cases \"where a whole enterprise is terminated or frustrated because its functioning is simply halted by decree or executive act, usually accompanied by other conduct.\"81 In the second category fall instances of \"acknowledged taking of property, and associated contractual rights are affected in consequence.\"82 The third category includes cases \"where the only right affected is incorporeal.\"83 In the latter cases, \"the mere nonperformance of a contractual obligation is not to be equated with a taking of property, nor (unless accompanied by other elements) is it tantamount to expropriation. Any private party can fail to perform its contracts, whereas nationalization and expropriation are inherently governmental acts.\"84\n\n*Waste Management II,* para. 172.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 173.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 174.\n\n*Idem.*\n\n250.\n\nThe tribunal in SGS *v. Philippines* excluded as a treaty claim the debt owed to SGS because there had not been a \"law or decree enacted by the Philippines attempting to expropriate or annul the debt, nor any action tantamount to an expropriation [...] A mere refusal to pay a debt is not an expropriation of property, at least where remedies exist in respect of such a refusal.\"85\n\nSGS *v. Philippines,* para. 161.\n\n251.\n\nIn the *Jalapa Railroad* case, the US-Mexican Mixed Claims Commission decided: \"Here the Government of Veracruz stepped out of the role of contracting party and sought to escape vital obligations under its contract by exercising its superior governmental power.\"86\n\nReferred to in Professor Schreuer\u2019s legal opinion, p. 50. Whiteman, *Digest of International Law* (1976), vol. 8, pp. 908-909.\n\n252.\n\nIn *Salini v. Jordan,* the tribunal held:\n\n\"Only the State, in the exercise of its sovereign authority *(puissance publique),* and not as a Contracting Party, has assumed obligations under the bilateral agreement. [...] In other words, an investment protection treaty cannot be used to compensate an investor deceived by the financial results of the operation undertaken, unless he proves that his deception was a consequence of the behavior of the receiving State acting in breach of the obligations which it had assumed under the treaty.\"87\n\n*Salini* v. *Jordan,* para. 155.\n\n253.\n\nWhat all these decisions have in common is that for the State to incur international responsibility it must act as such, it must use its public authority. The actions of the State have to be based on its \"superior governmental power\". It is not a matter of being disappointed in the performance of the State in the execution of a contract but rather of interference in the contract execution through governmental action.\n\n254.\n\nIn the instant case, what actions did Argentina take to step out of its role as a contractual party? In the first place, Argentina issued Decree 669/01 on the basis of the 2000 Emergency Law. Argentina has advanced the argument that termination of the Contract by Decree 669/01 was based not only on the fiscal emergency but also on the failures of the Contractor. This is not a credible argument inasmuch as Decree 669/01 and Decree 1205/01 did not provide for termination based on non-performance and Argentina itself has manifested in these proceedings that at no time had it affirmed that the Contract was rescinded by the Contractor\u2019s fault.88\n\nParas. 222 and 232 of the Rejoinder.\n\n255.\n\nArgentina itself has argued that the Tribunal should defer to Argentina in deciding what is in the public interest of Argentina, and should consider the measures taken by Argentina - the 2000 Emergency Law and Decree 669/01 - as a response by the State to the impending financial and social crisis. The Tribunal has no intention of second guessing the considerations that led Argentina to declare a fiscal emergency in 2000. At this stage, the Tribunal simply notes that this argument is not consistent with the submission that Decree 669/01 was a measure taken as a simple contracting party. Whether Decree 669/01 is a measure in breach of the Treaty is a question that the Tribunal will address later.\n\n256.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, Decree 669/01 is not the only measure that can be attributed to Argentina as a State. Argentina used its governmental authority on other occasions. First, Argentina interfered in the contractual relationship with SITS by requiring changes in the economic equation when the change of Government occurred and nearly a year before the fiscal emergency was declared. Argentina has claimed that, as a State, it has a right under administrative law to request changes in a contract. The Tribunal considers that, irrespective of whether the changes requested were or were not within the *ius variandi* of the State (a disputed matter between the parties), this is a right that Argentina claims as a State in order to control the deteriorating fiscal situation in the country. This is an assessment by the State related to the public interest and not one that would pertain to a regular contractual party.\n\n257.\n\nSecond, Argentina failed to enter into the agreements with the Provinces related to the External Circuit. The Tribunal considers this matter to be beyond a contractual breach because Argentina relies on its political structure to excuse itself from the obligation undertaken and because it relied on it as a matter of policy for terminating the Contract. As a State, Argentina should know what is possible for it to do (or not to do) with respect to its Provinces and the extent to which it may honor its commitments because of its own political structure.\n\n258.\n\nThird, the *permanent* suspension of the two main components of the Project -the RPN sub-system and the DNM sub-system - also falls in the non-contractual category. The fact that an authorization was needed and never given for the immigration component is clearly a governmental act which had no basis in the Contract and its need came to light only when the DNM sub-system started to operate and in the context of Argentina expressing its intention to renegotiate the Contract. The alleged authorization requirement is suspect because the Contract had been drafted by Argentina and all the agencies that were involved later when the Contract was in effect had previously reviewed the terms of the Contract. The \"provisional\" suspension of the RPN sub-system is reasonable in terms of checking and correcting errors; what exceeds the contractual role and does not fit with Argentina\u2019s legitimate security concerns is that SITS was not allowed to correct the error and that the manual system is still in effect as it was when the Contract was open for bids. During the Contract renegotiation, the resumption of the RPN sub-system was not linked to security concerns.\n\n259.\n\nFourth, Decree 669/01 provides for compensation to be paid. Argentina has not paid compensation, using arguments that go beyond its rights under the Contract. We refer to the issue of the source codes. SITS may or may not have complied with Article 10.12. At this stage it is immaterial because the Contract has been terminated and this article only required that the source codes be deposited with a notary public until the termination of the Contract. There is no provision of the Contract that requires delivery of the source codes to Argentina at Contract termination. There are provisions covering delivery of non-exclusive licenses but not of source codes. This is such an important matter in the technology field, as Argentina itself has argued, that it could not have been left to interpretation and guesswork. If it had been really intended *ab initio* that the source codes would have to be delivered to Argentina, the Contract would have specifically provided for this obligation. This is confirmed by the answer given by the Ministry of the Interior to Question No. 48 of SITS during the bidding stage of the Contract. The Minister had been asked to confirm that, under Article 95 of the Contract, the Ministry of the Interior\u2019s only right in respect of the software would be a non-exclusive license to its use. The Minister replied that the Bidding Terms and Conditions required that a permanent and non-exclusive license of use of the software be transferred to the Ministry. The Minister added: \"This notwithstanding the bidder or the contractor may transfer in full or in part the property rights to the software if it would be acceptable [to the bidder or the contractor].\"89\n\nExhibit 94 to the Memorial, emphasis added by the Tribunal. Translation by the Tribunal.\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, in the actions listed above, Argentina acted in use of its police powers rather than as a contracting party even if it attempted at times to base its actions on the Contract. As to the other allegations made by Siemens, they relate to delays, non-budgetary allocations, or continuation of the manual system to issue DNIs and are actions that, in the context, could be construed as acts of a contractual party or of the sovereign acting as such. They are not essential to a finding of expropriation and the Tribunal will not consider them.\n\n**ii) Ordinary Courts\u2019 Review of the Legality of the Expropriation and of the Amount on Account of the Compensation under Article 4(2) of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nArticle 4(2) provides that the legality of the expropriation, nationalization or equivalent measure, and the amount of compensation, may be subject to review by the ordinary courts. Argentina has reserved its right to apply this review option to any future decision of the Tribunal in connection with the expropriation. The context of the sentence does not support any right of Argentina in that respect. Article 4(2) is concerned with expropriation, nationalization or measures tantamount to either taken by the parties to the Treaty, and with the compensation paid. It is that expropriation or nationalization or compensation that is subject to the review of the ordinary courts, not a decision by this Tribunal. The objective of the sentence in question is to ensure that the investor has access to the ordinary local courts to review actions by the Government. It is a right that the parties accord to the investor, not to themselves, in relation to decisions of this Tribunal.\n\n**iii) Autonomy of the Measures constituting Creeping Expropriation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nArgentina has argued that each measure alleged by the Claimant to be part of the process that results in a creeping expropriation must have an adverse effect on the investment, and that in the instant case it is not possible to speak of successive acts because if agreement had been reached on the renegotiated Contract, the Contract would not have been thwarted, to use Argentina\u2019s own words.\n\n263.\n\nBy definition, creeping expropriation refers to a process, to steps that eventually have the effect of an expropriation. If the process stops before it reaches that point, then expropriation would not occur. This does not necessarily mean that no adverse effects would have occurred. Obviously, each step must have an adverse effect but by itself may not be significant or considered an illegal act. The last step in a creeping expropriation that tilts the balance is similar to the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. The preceding straws may not have had a perceptible effect but are part of the process that led to the break.\n\n264.\n\nWe are dealing here with a composite act in the terminology of the Draft Articles. Article 15 of the Draft Articles provides the following:\n\n\"(1) The breach of an international obligation by a State through a series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful occurs when the action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act\".\n\n265.\n\nAs explained in the ILC\u2019s Commentary on the Draft Articles:\n\n\"Paragraph 1 of Article 15 defines the time at which a composite act \u2018occurs\u2019 as the time at which the last action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act, without it necessarily having to be the last of the series.\"\n\n266.\n\nThe concept could not be better explained.\n\n**iv) Expropriation of Contractual Rights and Proper Law of the Contract**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nArgentina has linked the argument about expropriation of contractual rights and the law applicable to the Contract and assumes that unless a contract is internationalized through a stabilization clause, it is not susceptible of expropriation. The fact that the Contract is subject to Argentine law does not mean that it cannot be expropriated from the perspective of public international law and under the Treaty. The two issues are unrelated. The Contract falls under the definition of \"investments\" under the Treaty and Article 4(2) refers to expropriation or nationalization of investments. Therefore, the State parties recognized that an investment in terms of the Treaty may be expropriated. There is nothing unusual in this regard. There is a long judicial practice that recognizes that expropriation is not limited to tangible property. The Tribunal will refer, for the sake of brevity, to the findings of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\") in the case of the *Norwegian Shipowners\u2019 Claims* and the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"PCIJ\") in the *Factory at Chorzow* Case.\n\n268.\n\nThe PCA held that \"[...] whatever the intentions may have been, the United States took, both in fact and in law, the contracts under which the ships in question were being or were to be constructed.\"90 The PCIJ found that:\n\n\"[...] it is clear that the rights of the Bayerische to the exploitation of the factory and to the remuneration fixed by the contract for the management of the exploitation and for the use of its patents, licenses, experiments, etc., have been directly prejudiced by the taking over of the factory by Poland. As these rights related to the Chorzow factory and were, so to speak, concentrated in that factory, the prohibition contained in the last sentence of Article 6 of the Geneva Convention applies in all respects to them.\"91\n\nNorwegian Shipowners\u2019 Claims (Norway v. United States), p. 325.\n\n*Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v. Poland),* Judgment (May 25, 1926), *PCIJ Series A, No.* 7, p. 44.\n\n269.\n\nThese findings on the issue are conclusive and have been followed by ICSID and NAFTA tribunals, and the Iran-US Claims Tribunal. The Respondent has taken exception to the relevance of cases decided by the latter tribunal on the basis of the law applicable to those cases. The Tribunal considers that the findings of that tribunal are significant in that they show the consistency of approach on this matter by different international jurisdictions.\n\n**v) Intent to Expropriate**\n----------------------------\n\n270.\n\nArgentina has argued against taking into consideration only the effect of measures for purposes of determining whether an expropriation has taken place. The Tribunal recalls that Article 4(2) refers to measures that \"a sus efectos\" (in its Spanish original) would be equivalent to expropriation or nationalization. The Treaty refers to measures that have the effect of an expropriation; it does not refer to the intent of the State to expropriate. The quotation of the finding of the PCA in *Norwegian Shipowners* refers to \"whatever the intentions\"92 of the US were when the US took the contracts. A different matter is the purpose of the expropriation, but that is one of the requirements for determining whether the expropriation is in accordance with the terms of the Treaty and not for determining whether an expropriation has occurred.\n\n*Norwegian Shipowners\u2019* Claims, p. 325.\n\n**vi) Was the Investment Expropriated?**\n----------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Tribunal has identified a series of measures that Argentina took which cannot be considered as measures based on the Contract but on the exercise of its public authority. Of all these measures, Decree 669/01 by itself and independently can be considered to be an expropriatory act. It was not based on the Contract but on the 2000 Emergency Law, it was a permanent measure and the effect was to terminate the Contract. Had it not been for Decree 669/01, and if a revised contract proposal had been agreed, the measures taken previously by themselves might not have had the effect and permanence required to be considered expropriatory, but, as no agreement was reached and the measures were never revoked, they stand as part of a gradual process which, with the issuance of Decree 669/01, culminated in the expropriation of Siemens\u2019 investment.\n\n272.\n\nContrary to the facts of the cases adduced by Argentina, the acts identified by the Tribunal as measures leading to the expropriation are acts of Argentina, decided at the highest levels of government, and not \"simple acts of maladministration by low level officials.\" For that reason, Argentina\u2019s argument that simple acts of maladministration by low-level officials should be pursued in the local courts lacks validity in the circumstances of the instant case.\n\n**vii) Was the expropriation in accordance with the Treaty?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nThe Treaty requires that the expropriation be for a public purpose and compensated. The Tribunal finds that there is no evidence of a public purpose in the measures prior to the issuance of Decree 669/01. It was an exercise of public authority to reduce the costs to Argentina of the Contract recently awarded through public competitive bidding, and as part of a change of policy by a new Administration eager to distance itself from its predecessor. On the other hand, the public purpose of the 2000 Emergency Law was to face the dire fiscal situation of the Government. This is a legitimate concern of Argentina and the Tribunal defers to Argentina in the determination of its public interest. However, while the Tribunal would be satisfied in finding that an expropriation has occurred based only on Decree 669/01, and that the public purpose pursued by this Decree, in the context of Argentina\u2019s fiscal crisis and the 2000 Emergency Law, would be sufficient to meet the public purpose requirement of expropriation under the Treaty, the Tribunal cannot ignore the context in which Decree 669/01 was issued, nor separate this Decree from the other measures taken by Argentina in respect of the investment that culminated in its issuance. Decree 669/01 became a convenient device to continue the process started more than a year earlier long before the onset of the fiscal crisis. From this perspective, while the public purpose of the 2000 Emergency Law is evident, its application through Decree 669/01 to the specific case of Siemens\u2019 investment and the public purpose of same are questionable. In any case, compensation has never been paid on grounds that, as already stated, the Tribunal finds that are lacking in justification. For these reasons, the expropriation did not meet the requirements of Article 4(2) and therefore was unlawful. The Tribunal will examine the issues of compensation after addressing the alleged breaches of other obligations of Argentina under the Treaty.\n\n**4. Fair and equitable treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**a) Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nSiemens argues that the obligation to treat an investment fairly and equitably requires arbitral tribunals to take into account the totality of the circumstances in each case. The proposition that investments shall have fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security constitutes the \"overriding obligation\", and other standards must be applied as part of this general one. According to Siemens, fair and equitable treatment and full protection and legal security are intended to accord foreign investors broad protection, including a stable and predictable investment environment. Predictability is an essential element of stability, the rules and practices that affect investments must be predictable. A State violates the fair and equitable treatment standard when it fails to respect the specific assurances that it had given to investors as an inducement to invest and on which investors relied in making the investment\n\n275.\n\nSiemens contends that Argentina provided assurances that SITS would be allowed to complete the Project and obtain the earnings that were the price of the System in an investment environment that was and would remain stable and predictable. To induce Siemens to invest in the Project, Argentina granted SITS the right to implement the complete and integral provision of the System and to issue all the DNIs to replace those existing on the date of the Contract, and all new DNIs and their renewals after the System entered into operation. The investment logically had to be made before the System startup and the return on the investment was dependent on the issuance of the DNIs and the processing of immigration proceedings.\n\n276.\n\nAccording to Siemens, the acts and omissions previously described destroyed irreparably the legal framework for Siemens\u2019 investment, and at all times prior to the unilateral termination of the Contract Argentina promised that the Project would continue and the operation of the System would be resumed. Furthermore, due to Siemens\u2019 claim for compensation, Siemens has faced serious problems in other activities in Argentina.\n\n277.\n\nSiemens argues that the standard of just and equitable treatment requires stable investment environments by ensuring transparency and predictable rules and practices, which in turn mean that the investor may rely on the undertakings made by the State to the investor. Additionally, fair and equitable treatment means freedom from coercion and harassment, due process and good faith. According to Siemens, RNP interposed serious obstacles to the regular performance of the DNI sub-system, the new authorities after the elections abused the vulnerable position of SITS and the renegotiation process announced in January 2000 was carried out under the threat of the early cancellation of the Contract. Siemens claims that Argentina committed gross procedural improprieties by interrupting the income generating activities, by denying SITS\u2019 access to the administrative records, by denying SITS the right to be heard on the May 2001 proposal and withholding information necessary for the decision of SITS on the proposal, by failing to meet the core requirements for terminating the Contract under the 2000 Emergency Law, and by removing administrative files pointing to the Government\u2019s failures. Furthermore, after termination of the Contract, SITS was denied information on the background of Decree 669/01 and evidence in support of its position, internal reports were issued without notice to SITS or without recording them in the administrative file, and SITS was excluded from the DNI sub-system test carried out together with SITS\u2019 former sub-contractors.\n\n278.\n\nAccording to Siemens, the actions referred to above show also lack of good faith in the conduct of Argentina; in particular, the May 2001 proposal was done in bad faith to trigger the Contract\u2019s termination. Siemens adds non-payment of compensation, keeping the Contract performance bond, not taking responsibility for the sub-contractors\u2019 claims and the fact that all the alleged contractual breaches on which Argentina bases its defense were never notified to SITS or Siemens.\n\n279.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, as regards the violation of the full protection and security obligation, Argentina argues that the Claimant has failed to allege how this breach had taken place and affirms that this obligation refers only to physical damage. Then Argentina objects to the concept of fair and equitable treatment advanced by Siemens. Argentina argues that fair and equitable treatment means no more than the minimal treatment afforded by international law. It certainly does not mean that it gives arbitral tribunals the power to decide on the basis of equity. Argentina refers approvingly to the interpretation on this point by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission (\"FTC\"), recent investment treaties signed by the US and the findings of tribunals in *Genin, S.D. Myers* and *Azinian.*\n\n280.\n\nArgentina disagrees with Siemens on the application of the standard of just and equitable treatment to the facts of the case. Argentina refers to the principle of good faith enshrined in this standard, how this standard applies equally to investors and States and how Siemens breached it during the failed negotiation that led to the rescission of the Contract. Thus Siemens systematically refused to reveal its cost structure; and \"[i]n a demonstration of bad faith, Siemens went along with negotiations with the Commission named by the Argentine Government, by successive reductions in the final price of IDs.\"93 Siemens also accepted the inclusion of the Contract in the 2000 Emergency Law and is prevented now by the doctrine of *estoppel* to claim that it was unaware of the implications, for \"if its intention was to save the contract, it should have undertaken to bear the consequences that resulted from this emergency and adjust its expectations and claims so as to reach the shared burden of sacrifice\" established by this law.94 The need for shared sacrifice, according to Argentina, stems from the good faith that the parties owe each other, and fair and equitable treatment \"in essence constitutes a guarantee of appropriate and reasonable treatment and that this should be viewed and analyzed taking into consideration the concrete and specific historical circumstances of the treatment. Fair and equitable treatment contains elements of good faith, consistency and reasonableness, which should be evaluated always bearing in mind the events that originated this arbitration.\"95\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 1079.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 1080.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 1082.\n\n281.\n\nArgentina also contends that the System did not provide the intended security and refers the Tribunal to the multiple security deficiencies pointed out in the audit performed by the Argentine authorities. In this respect, Siemens is responsible for SITS\u2019 failures. It is not possible to make a claim for events affecting the subsidiary and at the same time avoid the legal consequences of the subsidiary\u2019s acts.\n\n282.\n\nAs a final argument under this heading, Argentina alleges that SITS and Siemens consented to the 2000 Emergency Law in a case of normative acquiescence. Argentina refers in this respect to the *Preah Vihear Temple* case where the ICJ found: \"It is an established rule that the plea of error cannot be allowed as an element vitiating consent if the party advancing it contributed by its own conduct to the error, or could have avoided it, or if the circumstances were such as to put that party on notice of a possible error.\"96 Argentina argues that Thailand, the party pleading error, can be substituted by the Claimant and SITS, which \"accepted the emergency and their incorporation to the emergency legal system.\"97\n\n*Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand), ICJ Reports* (1962) p. 26, cited in para. 1090 of Counter-Memorial.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 1092.\n\n283.\n\nIn its Reply, Siemens affirms that the allegation of Argentina that the conduct of SITS or Siemens lacks good faith because of the failure to reveal the cost structure is misplaced. Indeed, Article 2(1) addresses the duties of the State to the investors and not the reverse, and neither the Contract nor the 2000 Emergency Law required such disclosure. As for the doctrines of *estoppel* and acquiescence invoked by Argentina, Siemens points out that both doctrines had their origins in inter-State relations and it is doubtful that they can be extended to the area of investor-State relations. Siemens claims that there is no statement of fact by Siemens on which Argentina could have relied to its own detriment, and as regards acquiescence to the law, Siemens observes that the applicability of legislation does not depend on the assent or protest of foreign investors or of any other party subject to the law, and the fact that SITS did not take legal action against Resolution No. 1779/00 of the Ministry of the Interior does not mean that Siemens waived its rights under the Treaty against an uncompensated expropriation or other actions violating the Treaty\u2019s substantive standards.\n\n284.\n\nSiemens denies that the protection accorded by the standard of fair and equitable treatment is the minimum required of States under international law:\n\n\"An interpretation that is in accordance with the BIT\u2019S object and purpose would also have to give some independent meaning to the fair and equitable treatment standard. An interpretation that reduces its meaning to standards that are contained already in customary international law would deprive it of any independent meaning and would make the provision redundant. The application of the general principles of international law is already mandated by Article 10, paragraph 5 of the BIT. If Article 2(1) of the BIT providing for fair and equitable treatment is to have an independent meaning it must be in addition to the general principles of international law.\"98\n\nReply, para. 504, quotation of Professor Schreuer\u2019s legal opinion.\n\n285.\n\nSiemens points out that the *Neer* standard has been rejected consistently in recent decisions: (i) in *ELSI,* the ICJ considered that to be a breach of the standard State conduct needs to show \"a willful disregard of the process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety\", (ii) in *Mondev Inti. Ltd. v. The United States of America* and *Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. the United States of America,* the tribunals used the adjectives \"improper and discreditable\", (iii) in *Loewen, Waste Management* and *MTD,* the tribunals considered discrimination against foreigners an important indicator of failure to respect fair and equitable treatment, and (iv) in *Waste Management* and *MTD* the tribunals used terms such as arbitrariness, idiosyncrasy, injustice, lack of good faith, lack of due process and proportionality.99\n\nReply, para. 506, quotation of Professor Schreuer\u2019s legal opinion, para. 299 et seq., where reference is made to: (1) *Neer v. Mexico,* Opinion, United States-Mexlco, General Claims Commission, October 15, 1926, 21 AJIL 555 (1927); (2) *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.* (ELSI) (United States of America v.

Loewen v. the United States of America,* Award, (June 26, 2003);\n\n286.\n\nAs regards the views of Argentina on the scope of \"full protection and security\", Siemens observes that the Treaty goes further than most investment treaties when it refers to \"legal\" security and this reference is \"a strong indication that the provision, as contained in the BIT [Treaty], goes beyond mere physical violence and extends to the investor\u2019s legal position.\"100 Siemens refers to the following measures or omissions that deprived it of its protection and legal security: failure to make the budgetary allocations, suspension of the income-generating activities, renegotiation of the Contract under extreme pressure, and abusive use of the 2000 Emergency Law to terminate the Contract.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 559, quotation from Professor Schreuer\u2019s legal opinion, emphasis added by the Claimant.\n\n287.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina argues that, given the failure of SITS to perform its obligations under the Contract and the circumstances of fiscal stringency, the issuance of Decree 669/01 could not be considered an arbitrary, grossly unfair, idiosyncratic measure, nor did it involve lack of due process. Argentina contests the broad interpretation of fair and equitable treatment by Siemens and takes issue with the approach taken by *Tecmed* and *MTD* in applying this standard of protection. Argentina considers that the standard applied by these tribunals does not reflect an accurate international standard. Argentina submits that fair and equitable treatment does not encompass the protection of legitimate expectations and the establishment of a stable investment environment.\n\n288.\n\nArgentina also submits that, even if the Tribunal were to apply an expanded concept of fair and equitable treatment, there was no violation of this standard by Argentina. Argentina refers to the fact that the Claimant had never raised the political motivation of Argentina\u2019s acts before this arbitration and had consented to the acts that it now questions. Argentina submits that Siemens agreed on the laws that it now questions and that is, among other reasons, why there was no violation of the Treaty by Argentina. Argentina wonders what legitimate expectation can be affected by acts of the State to which the investor has consented.\n\n**b) Considerations of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nThe parties\u2019 allegations raise issues about the scope of standard of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security and its relevance in this case. As regards the scope, the parties hold different views on whether the obligation to treat an investment fairly and equitably refers to the minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law or requires from the State a higher standard of conduct more in consonance with the objective of the Treaty. They also differ on whether \"security\" refers to physical security or to security in a wider sense. The Tribunal will first address these two issues.\n\n290.\n\nIn their ordinary meaning, the terms \"fair\" and \"equitable\" mean \"just\", \"even-handed\", \"unbiased\", \"legitimate\".101 As expressed in the Treaty preamble, it is the intention of the State parties to intensify their economic cooperation, and their purpose to create favorable conditions for the investments of the nationals of a party in the territory of the other, while recognizing that the promotion and protection of such investments by means of a treaty may serve to stimulate private initiative and improve the well being of both peoples. It follows from the ordinary meaning of \"fair\" and \"equitable\" and the purpose and object of the Treaty that these terms denote treatment in an even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion and protection of foreign investment and stimulating private initiative. The parties to the Treaty show by their intentions and objectives a positive attitude towards investment. Terms such as \"promote\" or \"stimulate\" are action words that indicate that it is the intention of the parties to adhere to conduct in accordance with such purposes. This understanding is confirmed by Article 2(1) of the Treaty, whereby each party even undertakes to promote the investments of nationals or companies of the other party.\n\n*The Oxford English Dictionary.* Similarly defines these terms *Diccionario de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola,* 22nd edition, at www.rae.es.\n\n291.\n\nThe specific provision of the Treaty on fair and equitable treatment is found also in Article 2(1) after the commitment to promote and admit investments in accordance with the law and regulations and as an independent sentence: \"In any case [the parties to the Treaty] shall treat investments justly and fairly (\"En todo caso tratar\u00e1 las inversiones justa y equitativamente\").\"102 There is no reference to international law or to a minimum standard. However, in applying the Treaty, the Tribunal is bound to find the meaning of these terms under international law bearing in mind their ordinary meaning, the evolution of international law and the specific context in which they are used.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the Treaty.\n\n292.\n\nArgentina has indicated its support for the interpretation of Article 1105 of NAFTA by the FTC. The Tribunal observes first that this article bears the heading \"Minimum Standard of Treatment.\" Paragraph 1 of this article states: \"Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\" As interpreted by the FTC and as indicated in the title of the article, the standard of treatment is the minimum required under customary international law.\n\n293.\n\nThe question whether fair and equitable treatment is or is not additional to the minimum treatment requirement under international law is a question about the substantive content of fair and equitable treatment. In 1927, the US-Mexican Mixed Claims Commission considered in the *Neer* case that a State has breached the fair and equitable treatment obligation when the conduct of the State could be qualified as outrageous, egregious or in bad faith or so below international standards that a reasonable and impartial person would easily recognize it as such. This description of conduct in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard has been considered as the expression of customary international law at that time. For the Tribunal the question is whether, at the time the Treaty was concluded, customary international law had evolved to a higher standard of treatment.\n\n294.\n\nIt will be useful for this purpose to review the cases referred to by the parties in support of their differing positions. Argentina has particularly relied on *Genin.* In that case, the tribunal without engaging in a textual analysis of the fair and equitable treatment clause in the US-Estonia BIT considered this requirement to be an international minimum standard, which could only be breached by \"a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards, or even subjective bad faith.\"103 That tribunal found that, in the circumstances of the case, Estonia did not breach the duty of fair and equitable treatment; however, it hoped that the \"Bank of Estonia will exercise its regulatory and supervisory functions with greater caution regarding procedure in the future,\"104 and observed that \"the awkward manner by which the Bank of Estonia revoked ElB\u2019s license, and in particular the lack of prior notice of its intention to revoke ElB\u2019s license and of any means for EIB or its shareholders to challenge that decision prior to its being formalized, cannot escape censure.\"105\n\n*Genin,* para. 367.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 372.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 381.\n\n295.\n\nAfter the interpretation of the FTC, several tribunals established under NAFTA have held that the customary international law to be applied is the customary international law as it stood when that treaty was concluded and not in 1927. In *Mondev,* the tribunal held that \"the content of the minimum standard today cannot be limited to the content of customary international law as recognized in arbitral decisions in the 1920s.\"106 The same tribunal noted that the State party in the dispute agreed that the international standard of treatment has evolved as all customary international law has, and that the two other State parties to NAFTA also agreed with this point.107 Therefore, that tribunal considered that:\n\n\"the FTC interpretations incorporate current international law, whose content is shaped by the conclusion of more than two thousand bilateral investment treaties and many treaties of friendship and commerce. Those treaties largely and concordantly provide for \u2018fair and equitable\u2019 treatment of, and for \u2018full protection and security\u2019 for, the foreign investor and his investments.\"108\n\nAnd found that \"To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith.\"109\n\n*Mondev Inti. Ltd. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award (October 11.2002), para. 123.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 124.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 125.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 116. The tribunal In *ADF* affirmed the same point: \"what customary International law projects Is not a static photograph of the minimum standard of treatment of aliens as It stood In 1927 when the Award In the *Neer* case was rendered. For both customary International law and the minimum standard of treatment of aliens It Incorporates, are constantly In a process of development.\" *ADF Group, Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award (January 9, 2003), para. 179.\n\n296.\n\nThe tribunal in *Loewen* came to a similar conclusion: \"Neither State practice, the decisions of international tribunals nor the opinion of commentators support the view that bad faith or malicious intention is an essential element of unfair and inequitable treatment or denial of justice amounting to a breach of international justice.\"110\n\n*Loewen,* parr. 132\n\n297.\n\nAfter reviewing arbitral awards under NAFTA, the tribunal in *Waste Management II* reached the conclusion that:\n\n\"the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the state and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment Is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"111\n\n*Waste Management II,* para. 98.\n\n298.\n\nThe parties have also referred to *Tecmed,* which describes just and equitable treatment as requiring:\n\n\"treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations.\"112\n\n*Tecmed,* para. 154. Unofficial translation from the Spanish original published by ICSID on its web site.\n\n299.\n\nIt emerges from this review that, except for *Genin,* none of the recent awards under NAFTA and **Tecmed** require bad faith or malicious intention of the recipient State as a necessary element in the failure to treat investment fairly and equitably, and that, to the extent that it has been an issue, the tribunals concur in that customary international law has evolved. More recently in *CMS,* the tribunal confirmed the objective nature of this standard \"unrelated to whether the Respondent has had any deliberate intention or bad faith in adopting the measures in question. Of course, such intention and bad faith can aggravate the situation but are not an essential element of the standard.\"113 That tribunal also understood that the conduct of the State has to be below international standards but not at their level in 1927 and that, as in **Tecmed** and *Waste Management II,* the current standard includes the frustration of expectations that the investor may have legitimately taken into account when it made the investment.\n\n*CMS,* para. 280.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal has already noted that the standards of conduct agreed by the parties to the Treaty indicate a favorable disposition to foreign investment. The purpose of the Treaty is to promote and protect investments. It would be inconsistent with such commitments and purpose and the expectations created by such a document to consider that a party to the Treaty has breached its obligation of fair and equitable treatment only when it has acted in bad faith.\n\n301.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the question of the meaning of full protection and security. According to Argentina, \"security\" refers only to physical security while the Claimant attributes to this term a wider meaning, in particular because the Treaty refers to \"legal security.\"\n\n302.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that, although the parties have argued the application of this standard as a single standard, the Treaty provides for the fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security under two different Articles. The parties do not seem to have found this separation to be significant and the Tribunal will not dwell further on this point. The Tribunal also notes that Argentina in its arguments did not address the fact that security was qualified by \"legal\" in this instance.\n\n303.\n\nAs a general matter and based on the definition of investment, which includes tangible and intangible assets, the Tribunal considers that the obligation to provide full protection and security is wider than \"physical\" protection and security. It is difficult to understand how the physical security of an intangible asset would be achieved. In the instant case, \"security\" is qualified by \"legal\". In its ordinary meaning \"legal security\" has been defined as \"the quality of the legal system which implies certainty in its norms and, consequently, their foreseeable application.\"114 It is clear that in the context of this meaning the Treaty refers to security that it is not physical. In fact, one may question given the qualification of the term \"security\", whether the Treaty covers physical security at all. Arguably it could be considered to be included under \"full protection\", but that is not an issue in these proceedings.\n\n*Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola,* 22nd edition, at www.rae.es. Translation by the Tribunal. The original text in Spanish reads as follows: \"cualidad del ordenamiento jur\u00eddico que implica la certeza de sus normas y, consiguientemente, la previsibilidad de su aplicaci\u00f3n.\"\n\n304.\n\nBased on this understanding of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and legal security, the Tribunal will now consider whether the actions of Argentina, identified by the Tribunal as actions taken by Argentina acting as a State, constitute a breach of this obligation.\n\n305.\n\nArgentina has argued that Siemens and its subsidiary, for whose conduct Siemens is responsible, acted in bad faith because they accepted the laws of Argentina and alleged before this Tribunal political motives which were never denounced during the long lasting re-negotiation of the Contract. Siemens has argued likewise that it was never notified under the Contract of all the failures that have been alleged by Argentina in these proceedings. The parties\u2019 response to these arguments is similar: both parties were intent on reaching a renegotiated agreement that ultimately proved elusive.\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that neither party may hold against the other positions that it may have taken during a good faith negotiation.115 In any case, acceptance of laws or regulations should not be held against a company which has accepted them by the Government that adopted them. As stated elsewhere by the Tribunal, to comply with the law is not understood to be an optional matter. In this respect, the arguments advanced by Argentina on acquiescence and *estoppel* are misplaced and have already been dealt with by the Tribunal.\n\nIn the *Factory at Chorzow* case, the PCIJ pointed out that it could not \"take into account declarations, admissions or proposals which the Parties may have made during direct negotiations between themselves, when such negotiations have not led to a complete agreement.\" *Merits, PCIJ, Series A* (1928), p. 51.\n\n307.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal finds without merit the argument made by Siemens that since filing its claim Siemens has encountered difficulties to operate in Argentina. This statement is contradicted by the affirmation in Siemens\u2019 Reply that Argentina holds Siemens in such high regard that it has repeatedly requested its intervention in other public projects, even after the Contract\u2019s termination\n\n308.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal finds that the initiation of the renegotiation of the Contract for the sole purpose of reducing its costs, unsupported by any declaration of public interest, affected the legal security of Siemens\u2019 investment. The Tribunal also finds that when a government awards a contract, which includes among its critical provisions an undertaking of that government to conclude agreements with its provinces, the same government can not argue that the structure of the State does not permit it to fulfill such undertaking. This runs counter to the principle of good faith underlying fair and equitable treatment. The arguments made to justify delay in paying compensation without basis in the Contract or Decree 669/01 and the denial of access to the administrative file for purposes of filing the appeal against Decree 669/01 show lack of transparency of Argentina in respect of the investment, particularly when Argentina itself has manifested in these proceedings that at no time had it affirmed that the Contract was rescinded due to the Contractor\u2019s fault.116\n\nRejoinder, paras. 222 and 232.\n\n309.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the full protection and legal security and fair and equitable treatment obligations under the Treaty have been breached by Argentina.\n\n**5. Arbitrary and Discriminatory Measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nSiemens argues that, based on the plain meaning of \"arbitrary\", the measures adopted towards Siemens\u2019 investment meet the test of arbitrariness: \"not governed by any fixed rules or standard\", \"performed without adequate determination of principle and one not founded in nature of things\", \"without cause based upon the law\", or \"failure to exercise honest judgment\", \"characterization of a decision or action taken by an administrative agency [...] [as] willful and unreasonable action without consideration or in disregard of facts or law or without determining principle.\"117\n\nMemorial, para. 337, citing *Black\u2019s Law Dictionary,* 1990, sixth edition, p. 104.\n\n311.\n\nAccording to Siemens, the intentional frustration of the performance of the Contract when all the investment had been made to put the System into operation was arbitrary. The measures were unreasonable, taken unilaterally without due cause or justification. They caused serious damage to Siemens for which it has not been compensated. The measures were also discriminatory in intent and effect. No other investor was treated like Siemens, no measures such as those imposed on Siemens\u2019 investment were adopted by Argentina concerning contracts or investments of similar importance, in particular, no other public contract was terminated by Argentina under the 2000 Emergency Law and compensation has never been paid. These discriminatory measures impaired Siemens\u2019 ability to manage, use and enjoy its investment.\n\n312.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Argentina argues that the measures it adopted were reasonable in proportion to their purpose and of general application. Thus, they were neither arbitrary nor discriminatory. Argentina refers to the concept of arbitrariness defined by the ICJ in *ELSI'.* \"It is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety;\"118 and the arbitral tribunal in *Genirr.* \"any procedural irregularity that may have been present would have to amount to bad faith, a willful disregard of due process of law or an extreme insufficiency of action.\"119 According to Argentina, the measures it took were in defense of vital security of the State, to keep the data on its inhabitants secure since otherwise it would violate rights enshrined in international treaties on the protection of human rights.\n\n*Genin,* Counter-Memorial, para. 1108 citing *ELSI, ICJ Reports* (1989), para. 128.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 1110 citing *Genin,* para. 371.\n\n313.\n\nArgentina also questions the qualification as arbitrary of the delay in approving the FOM. The FOM presented by SITS was not in a condition to be approved and Argentina showed diligence by requesting in advance information that would have helped in speeding up the approval process and that SITS did not provide. According to Argentina, a government may not be accused of being arbitrary when it tries to protect and preserve the confidentiality of the data on its inhabitants.\n\n314.\n\nAs to the meaning of \"discriminatory\", Argentina contends, based on *ELSI* and *S.D. Myers,* that, for a measure to be discriminatory, the measure has to be harmful, favor a national against a foreign investor and be intended to discriminate. Argentina argues that the measures it took were intended to protect its citizens and as such could not be considered discriminatory. Furthermore, the measures taken in relation to Siemens\u2019 investment had nothing to do with any differential treatment vis-\u00e0-vis any other investor group in the same situation because Siemens was in a unique situation.\n\n315.\n\nIn its Reply, Siemens insists that in terms of Article 2(3) of the Treaty actions are arbitrary if they are opposed to the rule of law or surprise a sense of juridical propriety, or if a measure harming an investor cannot be justified in terms of rational reasons that are related to the facts. Siemens contests the argument of \"voluntary consent\" or \"acquiescence\" by SITS and affirms that what occurred was an abusive exercise of the State\u2019s authority that left SITS powerless. According to Siemens, Argentina\u2019s measures were \"arbitrary because they dismantled the entire legal framework that had led Siemens to conduct its investment, contrary to the expectations of any reasonable and impartial person. The political motivation behind Argentina\u2019s actions only serves to emphasize the arbitrariness of the measures adopted.\"120\n\nReply, para. 571.\n\n316.\n\nAs regards discriminatory treatment, according to Siemens, the criterion is whether the foreign investor has been treated less favorably than domestic investors or investors of other nationalities; *de facto* discrimination is sufficient even without violation of the host State\u2019s domestic law. Siemens argues that the measures taken towards Siemens\u2019 investment were not of a general nature; the Contract is the only significant contract terminated which involved a foreign investor and the only foreign investment terminated unilaterally under the 2000 Emergency Law.\n\n317.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina recalls that the Contract was unique in terms of its scope, importance, duration and expense. Argentina explains how the Contract could not be compared to the passport issuance contract that the Claimant adduced as evidence of discrimination. Passports are not obligatory, while DNIs are. In the face of an economic crisis, Argentina had a right to protect its interests and those of its citizens. The measures taken by Argentina in response to \"the fiscal emergency were of general operation, for a public purpose and did not introduce unreasonable discrimination.\"121 Argentina further explains that the fact that public utilities were excluded from the 2000 Emergency law does not mean that the crisis did not impact their rights, e.g., foreign companies that invested in the natural gas transport and distribution agreed to defer adjustment of their fees as permitted in their contracts sixteen months before the termination of the contract. Argentina concludes by asserting that, given the enormous costs of the Contract, \"it cannot be said that the measures taken to terminate it early were unfair, unjust or disproportionate to the extent of the problem in hand.\"122\n\nRejoinder, para. 643.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 657.\n\n**b) Considerations of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nIn its ordinary meaning, \"arbitrary\" means \"derived from mere opinion\", \"capricious\", \"unrestrained\", \"despotic.\"123*Black\u2019s Law Dictionary* defines this term as \"fixed or done capriciously or at pleasure; without adequate determining principle\", \"depending on the will alone\", \"without cause based upon the law.\" There is also abundant case law on the interpretation of this term to which the parties have referred. The Tribunal considers that the definition in *ELSI* is the most authoritative interpretation of international law and it is close to the ordinary meaning of the term emphasizing the willful disregard of the law. The element of bad faith added by *Genin* does not seem to find support either in the ordinary concept of arbitrariness or in the definition of the ICJ in *ELSI.*\n\n*The Oxford English Dictionary.* This term is similarly defined In the *Diccionario de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola,* 22nd edition, atwww.rae.es.\n\n319.\n\nIn the instant case, certain measures taken by Argentina do not seem to be based on reason. Argentina has explained that an authorization was needed to start the operation of the DNM sub-system, but has failed to explain why the authorization was never given after the investment was made and the DNM sub-system had started to operate. Similarly, the Tribunal does not question the importance to the vital interests of Argentina to have secure identification of individuals, but applied to the suspension of the RPN sub-system such argument would have justified requiring an immediate correction of the error. No evidence has been submitted that the error could not be corrected. Instead, SITS was denied the possibility of correcting the error. While the Tribunal could accept that there may have been reasons to justify the temporary suspension of the DNM and RPN sub-systems, the Tribunal finds its permanent suspension arbitrary.\n\n320.\n\nAs to discriminatory measures, under Article 3(1) and (2) of the Treaty, the parties undertook to treat each other\u2019s nationals and companies not less favorably than they treat their own investors or those of a third party. Whether intent to discriminate is necessary and only the discriminatory effect matters is a matter of dispute. In *S.D. Myers,* the tribunal considered intent \"important\" but not \"decisive on its own.\"124 On the other hand, the tribunal in *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador* found intent not essential and that what mattered was the result of the policy in question.125 The concern with the result of the discriminatory measure is shared in *S.D. Myers'.* \"The word \u2018treatment\u2019 suggests that practical impact is required to produce a breach of Article 1102, not merely a motive or intent.\" The discriminatory results appear determinative in *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States,*126 where the tribunal considered different treatment on a *de facto* basis to be contrary to the national treatment obligation under Article 1102 of NAFTA.\n\n*S.D. Myers,* para. 254.\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v.* Republic of Ecuador, LCIA case No. UN3467, Award (July 1.2004), para. 177.\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award (December 16, 2002), para. 184.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs that intent is not decisive or essential for a finding of discrimination, and that the impact of the measure on the investment would be the determining factor to ascertain whether it had resulted in non-discriminatory treatment. The Claimant has based its arguments mainly on the fact that the Contract was the only major contract, and the only contract with a foreign investor, terminated under the 2000 Emergency Law, while the contract of the Government with an Argentine national to issue passports was allowed to stand notwithstanding the high costs associated with it. The Respondent has explained to the Tribunal that the Contract was unique and that the mandatory nature of DNI justified the difference in treatment. The Tribunal considers that, while there are aspects in the actions of Argentina that seem discriminatory, the allegations of the Claimant have not been fully substantiated. Given the holdings of the Tribunal under other protections of the Treaty, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to determine whether Argentina breached the non-discriminatory treatment obligation.\n\n**VII. Compensation**\n---------------------\n\n**1. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nSiemens claims that it is entitled to receive full and comprehensive compensation for the breaches of the Treaty and to recover the fair market value of its wrongfully expropriated investment, calculated for valuation purposes immediately before the date of expropriation of May 18, 2001; the loss of profits or *lucrum cessans* and the additional damage caused as a result of the expropriatory measures and acts, including those damages claimed by subcontractors and suppliers of Siemens and/or SITS regarding the Project and caused by Argentina\u2019s expropriation. In addition, Siemens claims pre and post-award interest of 6% compounded annually.\n\n323.\n\nSiemens argues that the expropriation was unlawful because it did not meet the conditions of the Treaty and international law, namely, it did not serve a public purpose, it did not satisfy the formal and substantive requirements of due process, it did not comply with the legal standards of treatment set forth in the Treaty and no compensation was paid. Based on the *Factory at Chorzow* case, Siemens pleads that an illegal dispossession leads to a twofold obligation: first, the obligation to restore the property in question or, if this is not possible, to pay compensation corresponding to its value; and second, there is an obligation to pay damages for any additional losses sustained as a consequence of the taking.\n\n324.\n\nSiemens observes that the value of the asset expropriated is not affected by whether or not an expropriation is lawful, but the amount of compensation due to an investor may be significantly affected. In the instant case, Siemens claims that the value of the property at the moment of the taking plus interest to the day of payment is a legal floor, and calls upon the Tribunal to add any potential consequential damages so as to \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"127\n\nMemorial, para. 392 citing the *Factory at Chorzow* case, *Merits, PCIJ, Series A,* 1928, p. 47,\n\n325.\n\nSiemens considers as appropriate the definition of fair market value in *Starrett Housing Corp. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran'.* \"[T]he price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in circumstances in which each had good information, each desired to maximize his financial gain, and neither was under duress or threat.\"128\n\n*Ibid.,* para, 394, citing *Starrett Housing Corp. v. the Islamic Republic of Iran,* Case No. 24, Final Award No. 314-24-1, (August 14, 1987), Claimant\u2019s Legal Authorities No. 52.\n\n326.\n\nSiemens argues that the fair market value includes the lost future profits that the enterprise would have gained had it been allowed to continue to operate, points out that SITS was a single project company, and affirms that its future revenues and profits were ascertainable on the basis of the commitments made by Argentina. Siemens refers to *Norwegian Shipowners, LETCO* and the concurring opinion of Judge Brower in *Amoco International Finance Corporation,* which stated that \"[...] where the expropriated property consists of contract rights, the compensation must be defined by the anticipated net earnings that would have been realized, as well as one can judge, had the contract been left in place until completion.\"129\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 402.\n\n327.\n\nSiemens claims that SITS, as a single project company, had foreseeable and ascertainable revenues and profits based on the commitments made by Argentina. Furthermore, any negative effect of the taking itself or the measures related to the taking must be excluded from the valuation. According to Siemens, a State may not reduce its obligation to pay compensation simply by creating a situation in which expropriation is to be feared before it occurs or by breaching contractual obligations or other duties to the foreign investor.\n\n328.\n\nAccording to Siemens, the appropriate method of valuation is the book value method in its variant of actual investments. Based on this method, Siemens claims that, as of May 17, 2001, the value of its investment amounts to US$283,859,710. Siemens affirms that this amount is comparable to the amounts that could be obtained with the application of other alternative methods of valuation. In addition, Siemens claims to be entitled to US$124,541,000 on account of *lucrum cessans.*\n\n329.\n\nSiemens also claims additional damages based on the unlawful nature of the expropriation measures and the behavior of Argentina prior to and after the date of expropriation. On this account, Siemens claims: (i) the costs incurred for maintaining a skeleton operation in Argentina to allow the conclusion of the Project, (ii) storage costs because of a 20-month delay in the transfer of assets to the Government, (iii) training costs and costs of technical support services provided by SITS during a period in excess of 75 days after May 18, 2001 pursuant to Article 26.3 of the Contract, (iv) damages claimed or that may be claimed by subcontractors involved in the Project\u2019s execution as a result of the expropriation, (v) unpaid invoiced services of SITS to the DNE agency in 1999, and (vi) the costs of this arbitration and of counsel. According to Siemens, subcontractors\u2019 damages amount to US$44,678,462 and the aggregate amount of the other items is US$9,397,899.\n\n330.\n\nSiemens claims pre-award compounded interest at the rate of 6% per annum so that it is fully compensated for the loss suffered and considers that May 18, 2001 should be the date of expropriation for valuation purposes, including for the assessed value of the lost profits. In the case of the additional damages, interest shall be applied from the dates in which they have been caused.\n\n331.\n\nArgentina argues in its Counter-Memorial that Siemens is not entitled to the compensation it has claimed: First, the Treaty in Article 4(2) states that compensation shall correspond to the value of the investment expropriated. Argentina interprets the reference to \"value\" of the investment - as opposed to \"fair market value\" - to exclude future profits. To support this point, Argentina reviews its own treaty practice and offers examples in four categories ranging from compensation on the basis of fair market value of the investment to the classical Hull formula, or a partial Hull formula or \"the value\" of the investment as in the case of the Treaty. Argentina alleges that there is no uniformity in the doctrine on the level of compensation.\n\n332.\n\nArgentina questions the cases relied on by Siemens to argue the extent of the damages claimed. According to Argentina, in *Maffezini,* neither *lucrum cessans* nor future profits were redressed, and full compensation awarded in the *Factory at Chorzow* case does not correspond to fair market value. Argentina requests the Tribunal to apply the principles of *Tecmed,* a case that Argentina finds strikingly similar to this case and quotes approvingly its reasoning under Mexican law. Argentina affirms that Argentine law applicable to this case and the 2000 Emergency Law to which Siemens consented do not grant the compensatory right claimed by Siemens.\n\n333.\n\nArgentina also questions the currency of the claimed compensation. Argentina argues that it did not guarantee the value of the investment in terms of dollars. Argentina points out that the Contract was not a dollar contract and that Siemens entered into a forward dollar contract to secure US$190 million, the same amount of the alleged loans made by the parent company to its Argentine affiliate. The existence of such contract, according to Argentina, proves that Siemens never intended to enter into a contract with Argentina in a foreign currency.\n\n334.\n\nArgentina explains that under Decree 669/01 for Siemens to be compensated in the amount calculated by the Appraisals Tribunal in accordance with the Contract, the applicable law and the Treaty, Siemens has to deliver real assets in condition to be used, otherwise Argentina would not receive any consideration for its compensation. To achieve this objective, the Appraisals TTN established the following conditions: delivery of the source codes, executable programs correctly set up and approved, delivery of the licenses for base software, databases and other necessary utilities, delivery of the licenses for application software of the sub-contractors, delivery of documentation related to applications, systems and training proved as to its usefulness, and ability to use the Contractor\u2019s software licenses.\n\n335.\n\nArgentina criticizes the valuation carried out by Siemens\u2019 expert. Argentina points out that: (i) he did just office work and had not checked the market values to confirm that the amounts charged by suppliers to SITS reflect the usual market practices, (ii) he did not consider whether the intra-Siemens Group transfers were carried out at arm\u2019s length, (iii) he did not carry out the task personally and did not perform any due diligence, (iv) he accepted all of Siemens\u2019 assumptions at face value without verifying them, (v) he affirms to have applied the book value method when he never analyzed where the alleged funds of Siemens were invested and the same analysis should have been done in respect of SITS\u2019 liabilities, (vi) he maintains that the book value method and the discounted cash flow analysis reach the same result when the figures are different, and (vii) he made a number of mistakes in calculating future income. Furthermore, the supporting documentation of the valuation is lacking.\n\n336.\n\nIn its Reply, Siemens argues that it is entitled to full compensation and that \"investment value\" has to be given its plain and ordinary meaning. Siemens points out that: (i) the Treaty does not qualify the reference to investment value, (ii) \"value\" in its ordinary meaning is defined as \"[t]he monetary worth or price of something; the amount of goods, services, or money that something will command in an exchange,\" and (iii) in a free market economy the exchange is conducted on the market. Therefore, \"the plain and ordinary meaning of \u2018value\u2019 is what one may expect to obtain in exchange for something, that is to say its \u2018fair market value.\u2019\"130\n\nReply, para. 620.\n\n337.\n\nSiemens observes that the legal authorities referred to by Argentina relate to the general debate on the extent of compensation under customary international law and not to the interpretation of the Treaty which contains a clear standard of full compensation. Siemens refers to *CME* where the tribunal, drawing its conclusions from the *Factory at Chorzow* case, ruled that \"genuine value\" in Article 5 of the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT meant the fair market value of the investment. Siemens also refers to *Biloune* which held that the fair market value, which takes into account future profits, is the most accurate measure of value of the expropriated property.\n\n338.\n\nOn the issue of future profits, Siemens draws the attention of the Tribunal to how the ILC has expressed the principle that lost profits are awarded where there is a reliable basis for the expectation of future income:\n\n\"In cases where lost future profits have been awarded, it has been where an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be compensable. This has normally been achieved by virtue of contractual arrangements or, in some cases, a well-established history of dealings.\"131\n\nAccording to Siemens, the contractual provisions concerning the production, issuance and price of the DNIs and other fees constituted a \"legally protected interest of sufficient certainty.\"132\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 632.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 633.\n\n339.\n\nSiemens points out that Argentina refers to documents which are 30 and 45 years old and pertain to debates already settled. Furthermore, in *Tecmed,* and contrary to what Argentina has alleged, the tribunal awarded compensation in accordance with the provisions of the relevant investment treaty, on the basis of the market value of the assets concerned, lost profits and compound interest.\n\n340.\n\nSiemens argues that, for purposes of Siemens\u2019 claim of expropriation under international law, the domestic law of Argentina and the provisions of the 2000 Emergency Law are irrelevant.\n\n341.\n\nSiemens also contends that, in any case, it is entitled to fair market value on the basis of the Treaty\u2019s most-favored-nation clause and other investment treaties signed by Argentina that specifically provide for such valuation of expropriated assets.\n\n342.\n\nSiemens contests the affirmation by Argentina that there was no unlawful expropriation and affirms that the requirements of public benefit, compensation and compliance with the general principles of treatment provided for in the Treaty had not been respected by Argentina. Siemens insists on full damages and, given the unlawful nature of the expropriation, consequential damages all paid in dollars. In this respect, Siemens recalls that the investment was made in dollars and argues that the forward contract itself proves this point. Siemens adds that it is entitled to the value of the investment immediately before the date of the taking when the peso had parity with the dollar. Siemens also recalls that, as it explained at the jurisdictional stage, its right to compensation under the Treaty is distinct from SITS\u2019 rights under the Contract and domestic law, and that Argentina never offered nor even approved any compensation under the 2000 Emergency Law.\n\n343.\n\nSiemens points out the shortcomings of the valuation report of the TTN, among others: (i) it was never submitted to SITS for consideration, (ii) it was prepared long after termination of the Contract and a long time after SITS lost control and supervision of the System, (iii) it evaluated items individually rather than the System as a whole, and (iv) it was not done in the currency of the investment. According to Siemens, the appraisal done by the TTN does not even reflect the compensation due to SITS under the 2000 Emergency Law.\n\n344.\n\nSiemens further points out that Argentina fails to provide a proper response for the sub-contractors\u2019 claims and the excuses for withholding the performance bond under the Contract are unsustainable and constitute another arbitrary measure taken by Argentina.\n\n345.\n\nAs regards Argentina\u2019s criticisms of the valuation report prepared by Siemens\u2019 expert, Siemens argues that Argentina has misunderstood the task of the expert, which was to evaluate the loss suffered by Siemens on the investment and not to evaluate SITS\u2019 loss under the Contract under Argentine law. According to Siemens, it was not the task of this expert to value individual assets: \"Valuing hardware and software on a part by part basis, when the very condition of those items are now the result of the expropriation, would provide no support in valuing Siemens A.G.\u2019s investment in the contractual right to operate the System and to generate revenue and return on its investment.\"133 Siemens adds that Argentina ignores the fact that the financial statements and accounting records relied on by the expert had been audited by a leading auditing firm -KPMG -, and refers to case law showing the appropriateness of the use of audited accounting records to carry out a valuation task. According to Siemens, Argentina also ignores the fact that SITS was a single project company, which should answer the criticism that the expert never examined where the alleged funds of Siemens were invested. Regarding the costs of the investment, Siemens contends that, if Siemens\u2019 global price was the lowest in the bidding for the Contract, the individual cost and prices of the components would also be lowest or extremely competitive compared to other tenders.\n\nReply, para. 699. Quotation from Expert Lemar\u2019s Rebuttal Report.\n\n346.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina argues that the fair market value of an expropriated property as the measure of compensation for an expropriated investment is not always applicable when an expropriation becomes necessary for social policy reasons. If this would not be the case, it would be a serious limitation on State sovereignty, and no social or economic reforms could be accomplished by poorer nations. Argentina maintains that it had effectively become bankrupt, and that to maintain that an expropriation is only lawful if full market compensation is payable is incompatible with the principle of self-determination. Argentina refers in this respect to professor Brownlie\u2019s statement that: \"The principle of nationalization unsubordinated to a full compensation rule may be supported by reference to principles of self-determination, independence, sovereignty and equality.\"134 Argentina also refers to the statement of the European Court of Human Rights in *James v. UK,* which held that Article 1 of the First Protocol does not \"guarantee a right to full compensation in all circumstances. Legitimate objectives of \u2018public interest\u2019 such as pursued in measures of economic reform or measures designed to achieve greater social justice, may call for less than reimbursement of full market value.\"135\n\nRejoinder, para. 575.\n\n*James v. UK, European Court of Human Rights,* 1986, 8, EHRR 123, para. 48, Respondent\u2019s Legal Authorities No. AL RA 86, quotation in the Rejoinder, para. 577. Emphasis added by the Respondent.\n\n347.\n\nArgentina affirms that these considerations are applicable to the situation in Argentina and are entirely consistent with the Treaty. Argentina concludes that, even if there was an expropriation, the Claimant would not be entitled to more than the direct losses and not to the *lucrum cessans.*\n\n**2. Considerations of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the following issues raised by the parties: applicable law for purposes of determining compensation, the meaning of \"value\" of the investment, currency of compensation, whether compensation should include *lucrum cessans* and consequential damages, on what evidence it should be based, the amount of compensation, the applicable rate of interest, and whether it should be simple or compound interest.\n\n**a) Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Argentina took measures that had the effect of expropriating the investment and that such expropriation is in breach of the Treaty, and hence unlawful. The Tribunal has also found that the Respondent breached its obligations to provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security and that it adopted arbitrary measures in respect of the investment. The law applicable to the determination of compensation for a breach of such Treaty obligations is customary international law. The Treaty itself only provides for compensation for expropriation in accordance with the terms of the Treaty.\n\n350.\n\nThe Draft Articles are currently considered to reflect most accurately customary international law on State responsibility. Article 36 on \"Compensation\" provides:\n\n\"1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution.\n\n2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\"\n\n351.\n\nThis Article relies on the statement of the PCIJ in the *Factory at Chorzow* case on reparation:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act - a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals - is that reparation must, so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"136\n\n*Factory at Chorzow, Merits, PCIJ, Series A, No. 17,* 1928, p. 47.\n\n352.\n\nThe key difference between compensation under the Draft Articles and the *Factory at Chorzow* case formula, and Article 4(2) of the Treaty is that under the former, compensation must take into account \"all financially assessable damage\" or \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act\" as opposed to compensation \"equivalent to the value of the expropriated investment\" under the Treaty. Under customary international law, Siemens is entitled not just to the value of its enterprise as of May 18, 2001, the date of expropriation, but also to any greater value that enterprise has gained up to the date of this Award, plus any consequential damages.\n\n**b) Value of the Investment**\n------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nIn the *Factory at Chorzow* case, the PCIJ asked the experts to calculate the value of the undertaking as of the date of the taking and as of the later date of its prospective judgment, and such value to include the lands, buildings, equipment, stocks and process, supply and delivery contracts, goodwill and future prospects. It is only logical that, if all the consequences of the illegal act need to be wiped out, the value of the investment at the time of this Award be compensated in full. Otherwise compensation would not cover all the consequences of the illegal act. While the Tribunal has determined that the Treaty does not apply for purposes of determining the compensation due to Siemens, which is governed by customary international law as reflected in *Factory at Chorzow,* it is worth noting that the PCIJ, as the Treaty itself, refers to the value of the investment without qualification. To reach its conclusion, the PCIJ did not need to have \"value\" qualified by \"full\". The Tribunal is satisfied that the term \"value\" does not need further qualification to mean not less than the full value of the investment. Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to discuss the argument advanced by the Claimant that it is entitled to the fair market value of its investment on the basis of the MFN clause in the Treaty.\n\n354.\n\nArgentina has pleaded that, when a State expropriates for social or economic reasons, fair market value does not apply because otherwise this would limit the sovereignty of a country to introduce reforms in particular of poor countries. Argentina has not developed this argument, nor justified on what basis Argentina would be considered a poor country, nor specified the reforms it sought to carry out at the time. Argentina in its allegations has relied on *Tecmed* as an example to follow in terms of considering the purpose and proportionality of the measures taken. The Tribunal observes that these considerations were part of that tribunal\u2019s determination of whether an expropriation had occurred and not of its determination of compensation. The Tribunal further observes that Article I of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights permits a margin of appreciation not found in customary international law or the Treaty.\n\n**c) Method of Valuation**\n--------------------------\n\n355.\n\nThe Claimant has proposed that compensation be calculated on the book value of the investment and that *lucrum cessans* be arrived at through discounting an estimate of profits calculated as a percentage of the revenues that SITS would have received if the Project would have run its course on the basis of the prices for its services set forth in the Contract. Usually, the book value method applied to a recent investment is considered an appropriate method of calculating its fair market value when there is no market for the assets expropriated. On the other hand, the DCF method is applied to ongoing concerns based on the historical data of their revenues and profits; otherwise, it is considered that the data is too speculative to calculate future profits. Normally the two methods are regarded as alternative means of valuing the same object. Here, however, Siemens\u2019s expert has applied the two in tandem because, under the terms of the Contract, all Siemens\u2019 costs would be incurred before the first peso of revenue would be realized. Therefore, Siemens has calculated its claimed loss of profits by applying a notional profit percentage to its projected future net revenues under the Contract, and then discounting those claimed profits to their present value via the DFC method, to which it then has added the book value of its costs actually incurred, i.e., its \"sunk costs\", which due to the actions of Argentina never will be able to produce the projected (or any) revenues. In other words, Siemens claims: (i) the present value of its estimated lost profits or *lucrum cessans,* plus (ii) the costs it actually incurred, which were \"wasted\" in the effort to produce the revenues from which those profits would have been derived.\n\n356.\n\nSiemens has defended its approach on the basis that SITS had already by May 18, 2001 incurred most Project development costs, the future costs could be estimated with reasonable certainty based on existing service contracts, and the prices for the delivery of SITS\u2019 services were known as were the number of DNIs to be produced. For these reasons, Siemens has argued that an estimate of the present value of future profits could be calculated to complement the book value of the investment. In this respect, the Lemar Report uses the rate of profits on sales projections presented to the board of Siemens at the time the Project was proposed for approval. At that time, the estimated profit rate was 18%. Expert Lemar reduces it to 16% because of developments during the first year of the Contract. Furthermore, Siemens\u2019 expert compares this estimated profit rate to other companies operating in Argentina with prices subject to State regulation, substantial upfront infrastructure investment cost to deliver the service, and the intention of the Government that they would produce a reasonable return to the owners of the investment.137 For this purpose, the expert uses information from the Argentine *Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Valores,* Bloomberg Services and the National Gas Authority of Argentina. Mr. Lemar arrives at a cross-sector average profit rate of 16%.138 Thus similar to that projected by Siemens as adjusted.\n\nExpert Lemar Report attached to the Memorial (\"Lemar Report\"), p. 23.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n357.\n\nWhile the Tribunal understands the reasons for the admittedly unusual approach followed by Siemens and considers that it has merit in the particular circumstances of this case, it has some concerns, as later explained, about how the valuation has been calculated, including the valuation of the *lucrum cessans.*\n\n**d) Evidence**\n---------------\n\n358.\n\nThe parties have taken different approaches in respect of what is the adequate evidence of Siemens\u2019 investment. For the Claimant, the audited financial statements of SITS are sufficient evidence of the amounts invested. For Argentina, there is a need to show how each dollar or peso was spent and relate each dollar or peso to the item financed with it. Argentina has insisted that the Tribunal use an expert to analyze the accounts of SITS and ensure that the amounts spent by SITS were spent for purposes of carrying out the Project.\n\n359.\n\nThe Claimant has pointed out that the Project consisted of a made-to-order integrated system to be carried out by a single purpose company -SITS- as required by Argentina itself. Siemens contends that the financial statements properly audited are sufficient evidence of Siemens\u2019 investments, that the financial statements of SITS were audited by KPMG, and that no evidence has been presented to question KMPG\u2019s audit.\n\n360.\n\nThe approach advanced by Argentina responds to the need to assess the value to Argentina of Siemens\u2019 investment for purposes of applying Decree No. 669/01. The Tribunal has to apply customary international law. Accordingly, the value of the investment to be compensated is the value it has now, as of the date of this Award, unless such value is lower than at the date of expropriation, in which event the earlier value would be awarded. It is not the value of the investment to Argentina but the value of the investment in terms of the sums invested in the Project. The Project had started to operate and no convincing evidence has been submitted showing that the funds intended for the Project made available to SITS, as loans or equity, were not used for the intended purpose. The valuation made by the Respondent was made from a perspective different from that required under customary international law months after the Contract was terminated. For these reasons, the Tribunal saw no merit in prolonging the proceedings and engaging an expert to analyze the accounts of SITS and where the funds had been invested.\n\n**e) Currency of Compensation**\n-------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nArgentina has argued that the Contract is denominated in pesos and that it had not guaranteed to Siemens the parity of the peso in effect at the time it entered into the Contract. This assertion is correct but it has to be considered in the context of the requirement that the consequences of the illegal act be wiped out. It would be hardly so if the parity of the currency would be added as yet another risk to be taken by the investor after it has been expropriated. In the instant case, the Claimant has pleaded that the Tribunal accept May 18, 2001 as the date of expropriation. The Tribunal has considered that the issuance of Decree 669/01 was determinant for purposes of its finding of expropriation and it is also the date that would be in consonance with Article 15 of the Draft Articles on the date of occurrence of a composite act. On May 18, 2001, the peso was at par with the dollar. If such obligation would have been met, the Claimant would have been compensated in pesos convertible at that rate. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that compensation shall be paid in dollars.\n\n**f) Amount of Compensation**\n-----------------------------\n\n362.\n\nSiemens claims $283,859,710 as the book value of the investment to May 17, 2001.\n\n363.\n\nUnder the Contract (Annex VIII), SITS committed itself to invest $201,486 million (\"Plan de Inversiones\" dated June 25, 1998 (\"the Investment Plan\")) and the variable costs such as satellite links, distribution costs of documents, overheads and operational expenses listed in page 2, paragraph 1.1 of Annex VIII. It is clear from the Contract that the total investment would include the items for which an amount is specified in the Investment Plan and those variable costs for which no estimated amount is given.\n\n364.\n\nAt the time of the 2000 SWIPCO audit, financed by SITS but carried out for the account of the Respondent, SITS had spent 126,235,000 pesos compared with the 241,486,000 envisaged in the Investment Plan. Both figures are exclusive of the variable costs for which no amount was specified in the Investment Plan.\n\n365.\n\nAfter termination of the Contract and for purposes of the valuation carried out by the TTN, SITS claimed to have invested AR$158,106,542. As explained in the report of the TTN of December 27, 2002,139 AR$47,237 pesos of that amount correspond to subcontractors\u2019 invoices and the remainder to invoices of companies in the Siemens group. In addition, SITS claimed \"nonproductive expenses\" (AR$44,452,193), interest on investments and \"nonproductive expenses\" (AR$25,260,008 and AR$8,332,985, respectively), capital contributions (AR$27 million), close-down costs (AR$31 million), certain paid and unpaid invoices (AR$13,100,000), subcontractors\u2019 claims (AR$40 million) and *lucrum cessans* (AR$254,942,070), for a total in excess of AR$444 million. The TTN considered, pursuant to the terms of Decree 669/01, only the AR$158,106,542 on account of investments and valued them at AR$72,161,510.\n\nExhibit 161 to the Counter-Memorial.\n\n366.\n\nArgentina in its comments of November 23, 2005 on the accounting information provided by Siemens asserts that the investment made reached AR$107,472,398.23. The Claimant disputes the amount and currency of the latest value attributed to the investment by Argentina, and of the valuation of the TTN. The Claimant also points out, *inter alia,* that \"non-productive expenses\" and interest have been excluded, notwithstanding the submission of the related invoices by SITS to the Ministry of the Interior on July 22, 2001.\n\n367.\n\nMr. Lemar, the Siemens\u2019 expert, has concentrated on the financing of SITS and has calculated the book value by adding Siemens\u2019 capital contributions, the loans made to SITS and the corresponding interest, as recorded in SITS\u2019s financial statements for 2001. Mr. Lemar concludes that the book value of Siemens\u2019 investment at May 17, 2001 was $283,859,710.\n\n368.\n\nThe Tribunal observes, that except for Mr. Lemar\u2019s, none of the valuations listed above respond to the criteria that need to be applied by the Tribunal and, as explained forthwith, the Tribunal has difficulty in accepting the value of the investment as calculated by Mr. Lemar. The Tribunal will use as a starting point SITS\u2019 audited financial statements. They have been audited by a highly qualified firm of independent auditors, which confirmed the reliability of the accounting records, and no evidence has been submitted to the Tribunal which proves otherwise. Mr. Lemar has capitalized all interest paid by SITS. *Prima facie,* capitalization of interest during the development phase of an investment is normal practice. However, the financing of the Project was highly leveraged. Siemens paid-in 27 million pesos in equity and financed the rest primarily by three-month credit at 12.08% in 1999, twelve-month credit at 9% in 2000 and again with three-month credit at 14% in 2001. The high interest charged to the Project and the short-term nature of the credit raise the issue of the extent to which it is appropriate to recognize the full amount of interest claimed as part of the value of the investment since it is a way of building into book value what otherwise would have to be earned as profits. The Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to capitalize interest on loans made to SITS for the Project, but in case of loans made by Siemens or its subsidiaries such interest should reflect the actual cost of funds to Siemens because the Tribunal\u2019s task is to determine the loss of Siemens itself. Therefore, the Tribunal will proceed to calculate140 the respective percentage of loans made to SITS by third parties, and Siemens and its subsidiaries and the costs of funds to the latter.\n\nAmounts have been rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n369.\n\nAccording to the funding data in the table in paragraph 3.7 of the Lemar Report, total loan funding by Siemens and its subsidiaries was AR$224,906,029 and loan funding by others AR$12,194,531 up to April 30, 2001, and AR$225,726,812 and AR$17,241,306 up to May 31, 2001. The Tribunal has adjusted these figures to May 17, 2001 by assuming that debt funding by Siemens, its subsidiaries and third parties increased at a steady daily rate during the month of May. The result is debt funding to May 17 of AR$225,356,136 by Siemens and its subsidiaries, and AR$14,962,117 by third parties. Therefore, Siemens and its subsidiaries provided 93.8% of all loans made to SITS and third parties provided 6.2%.\n\n370.\n\nFor purposes of determining an appropriate interest rate on loans made by Siemens or its subsidiaries, the Tribunal observes that, as a general matter, corporations of Siemens\u2019 size and creditworthiness hedge a substantial portion of the interest rate risk inherent in their fixed rate borrowings through floating interest rate swaps. Hence, the cost of borrowing that should be taken into account is the floating rate that Siemens could have achieved using interest rate swaps during the life of the Contract from November 26, 1998 to May 17, 2001. The average of such interest rate during this period was 2.35%.141\n\nCalculation based on data published by Bloomberg.\n\n371.\n\nNow the Tribunal turns to the percentage of interest payments made to Siemens and its subsidiaries that would be appropriate to capitalize based on the assumed cost of funds to Siemens in addition to interest payments paid to third parties. To arrive at such percentage, it is necessary to calculate the ratio of 2.35% to the annual average interest rate charged to SITS as reflected in SITS\u2019 financial statements.142 Thus, 2.35% is: (i) 18.35% of 12.08% (the average interest rate charged in fiscal year 1998-1999), (ii) 26.11% of 9% (the average interest rate charged in fiscal year 1999-2000), and (iii) 16.78% of 14% (the average interest rate charged in fiscal year 2000-2001). Therefore, the percentage of interest payments to be capitalized out of payments made to Siemens and its subsidiaries is 18.35% in 1998-1999, 26.11% in 1999-2000 and 16.78% in 2000-2001.\n\nAnnex C of the financial statements.\n\n372.\n\nAs recorded in its financial statements, SITS paid on account of interest: AR$150,828 in fiscal year 1997-1998, AR$1,383,596 in fiscal year 1998-1999, AR$12,156,499 in fiscal year 1999-2000 and AR$16,950,704 up to May 17, 2001,143 for a total of AR$30,642,627. Of that amount, 93.8% would correspond to payments made to Siemens and its subsidiaries: AR$1,297,813 in fiscal year 1998-1999,144 AR$11,402,796 in fiscal year 1999-2000 and AR$15,899,760 in fiscal year 2000-2001 up to May 17, 2001, for a total of AR$28,600,639. The remainder AR$2,041,988 was paid by SITS to third parties. The Tribunal will now apply to the amounts paid by SITS to Siemens and its subsidiaries the yearly percentages arrived at in the preceding paragraph with the following results: AR$234,255 represents 18.35% of the interest paid to Siemens and its subsidiaries in fiscal year 1998-1999, AR$2,977,270 represents 26.11% of such payments made in fiscal year 1999-2000 and AR$2,667,979 represents 16.78% of those made in fiscal year 2000-2001 up to May 17, 2001. These three items add up to AR$5,879,504. The Tribunal will allow that amount of interest paid to Siemens and its subsidiaries plus AR$2,041,988 paid to third parties for a total of AR$7,921,492 to be capitalized for purposes of the calculation of the book value of Siemens\u2019 investment. Therefore, the book value calculated by Siemens\u2019 expert Lemar should be reduced by the difference between the aggregate amount of interest payments made to Siemens and its subsidiaries - AR$28,600,369 - and AR$5,879,504, namely, AR$22,720,865.\n\nDuring the full fiscal year 2000-2001 SITS paid AR$27,017,497 on account of interest. This amount needs to be adjusted to May 17, 1981 because SITS\u2019 fiscal year ran until September 30. For this purpose, the Tribunal has assumed that Interest accrued at the same rate each day, divided the amount of Interest payments made by 365, multiplied the daily rate by the number of days between May 17 and September 30 -136 days- and deducted the result -AR$10,066,793-from the amount of interest paid that fiscal year. This brings the amount of interest payments between October 1.2000 and May 17, 2001 to AR$16,950,704.\n\nNo interest payments to Siemens and Its subsidiaries are recorded in the financial statements for fiscal year 1997-1998.\n\n373.\n\nThe book value calculation by Mr. Lemar includes two other items that the Tribunal finds inappropriate. First, in note 5 to SITS\u2019 financial statements for fiscal year 2000-2001 under the heading of \"Resultados extraordinarios\", there is an entry on \"Constituci\u00f3n previsi\u00f3n de otros cr\u00e9ditos\" with an amount of AR$42,253,305. This item cross-refers to note 4.5, which explains that this amount corresponds to tax credits that have been provisioned in full because of the uncertainty regarding their recoverability and have been charged as extraordinary losses. The Tribunal holds the opinion that it is incorrect to include this amount in the book value of SITS for purposes of compensation. Indeed, the tax credits had not been realized because of SITS\u2019 lack of revenues. Hence, the amount of AR$42,253,305 should also be subtracted from the calculation of the book value.\n\n374.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal refers again to note 5 to the financial statements of SITS for fiscal year 2000-2001 and to the item on \"Constituci\u00f3n previsi\u00f3n para riesgos relacionados con la rescisi\u00f3n del contrato\" under the heading of \"Resultados extraordinarios.\" An entry of AR$10,445,000 is listed on that account. Since the Tribunal has allowed compensation for consequential damages, as explained later, the provisioning for risks related to Contract termination would lead to double counting and is disallowed for purposes of the book value calculation.\n\n375.\n\nTo conclude the book value calculation, the Tribunal decides that such value is the value claimed by Siemens minus the amounts disallowed above on account of excessive interest rates, tax credits and risks associated with Contract termination. The amounts corresponding to these items add up to AR$75,419,170, which when subtracted from AR$283,859,710 claimed by Siemens reduce the book value of the investment to AR$208,440,540.\n\n376.\n\nAs the Tribunal has noted, it has been a matter of controversy whether to use funds invested as a measure of the value of the investment or how these funds have been used. The Tribunal has looked into the use of funds as recorded in the financial statements themselves and the result of such examination confirms the adjusted book value set forth above. The Tribunal has taken into account the items in the financial statements that correspond to the Project as such, \"bienes de uso\", intangible assets and \"project cost\". It emerges from note 5 to SITS\u2019 2001 audited financial statements (\"Estado de resultados\" under the heading of \"Resultados extraordinarios\") that, in 2001 and because of the termination of the Contract, SITS wrote off AR$39,777,220 of intangible assets, AR$49,678,876 of \"bienes de uso\" and AR$123,127,297 of \"project costs\". These three items add up to AR$212,583,393.\n\n377.\n\nThe audited financial statements reflect the financial situation of SITS on September 30, 2001 and the Tribunal has the task to value the investment of Siemens at May 17, 2001. Therefore, the Tribunal has considered it appropriate to compare the aggregate amount of funds applied to \"bienes de uso\", intangible assets and \"project cost\" between September 2000 and September 2001, to assume that these funds were applied at the same daily rate through the period, and to subtract from the difference the amount corresponding to the 136 days between May 17 and September 30, 2001. These assumptions correspond, *mutatis mutandis,* to those applied by expert Lemar to the sources of funds to calculate the value of the investment to May 17, 2001. The financial statements for 2001 show that SITS spent AR$20,741,994 in \"project cost\" during the year and AR$8,973,678 on \"bienes de uso\" (no funds were applied to intangible assets). These two items add up to AR$29,715,672. This amount prorated by 365 days results in a daily application of funds to such items of AR$81,412.8, which multiplied by 136 is equal to AR$11,072,140. The subtraction of this amount from AR$212,583,393 (the sum expended on account of \"bienes de uso\", intangible assets and \"project cost\") results in AR$201,511,253, which the Tribunal considers a reasonable approximation to the amount applied to \"bienes de uso\", intangible assets and \"project cost\" up to May 17, 2001. When the allowed capitalized interest of AR$7,921,492 is added to this amount we arrive at AR$209,432,745. A result slightly higher than the book value, which can be explained by the adjustments that need to be made to reflect the value of the investment on May 17, 2001.\n\n378.\n\nSiemens further claims $124,541,000 on account of loss profits before taxes.\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the amount claimed on account of lost profits is very unlikely to have ever materialized for the following reasons:\n\n380.\n\nFirst, in considering the estimated rate of profit on sales, the Tribunal recalls that the calculation of the Claimant assumes the issuance of 33 million DNI. The Tribunal considers that this amount is excessive taking into account that the Claimant accepted to make the investment with a guaranteed minimum of 24 million DNI (Article 16(b) of the Contract).145 Therefore, the estimated amount of revenues of AR$889,147,000 calculated by the Claimant needs to be reduced by AR$270 million (30 pesos per each DNI multiplied by 9 million) to AR$619,147,000.\n\nThe TTN points out in its report that the license of Printrak that SITS held to print DNIs was valid for printing only 24 million documents. Exhibit 161 to the Counter-Memorial, folio 15.\n\n381.\n\nSecond, the amount of AR$619,147,000 includes a 21% value added tax (Article 4.4 of the Contract) equal to AR$107,455,000, which needs to be subtracted and results in AR$511,692,000. Applying to this amount the 16% profit rate results in profits before applicable taxes of AR$81,870,000 over the life of the Contract.\n\n382.\n\nThird, the discount rate to be applied to the estimated profits should reflect the cost of money and the country and business risks. According to Siemens\u2019 own expert, this should be a rate within a range of 11% and 15%. Mr. Lemar himself has offered a calculation using a rate in the middle of such range -13%. The Tribunal considers this rate appropriate taking into account the country and business circumstances of the operation and the cost of funds.\n\n383.\n\nFourth, Siemens\u2019 expert has discounted the profits over the expected life of the Contract assuming that it would not be extended. It was possible for the Contract to be extended for an additional six years. It would not be unreasonable to assume that delays would have occurred in the normal course of Project operation given the novelty and complexity of the Project; it is undisputed by the parties that it was the first of its kind. Furthermore, the analysis performed by Mr. Lemar to take into account the three-month delay in Project start-up shows the sensitivity of profits to delays in the timing of revenues. A delay of three months resulted in a drop of 2% in the profit rate notwithstanding the addition of AR$29 million in revenues for printing of electoral roles which had been underestimated in an earlier calculation. An extension of the Contract to 9 or 12 years would have had devastating effects on the profit rate.\n\n384.\n\nFifth, the profits would have been subject to a corporate profits tax.\n\n385.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Siemens is not entitled to any compensation on account of profit loss.\n\n386.\n\nAdditionally, Siemens has claimed $9,178,000 for postexpropriation costs incurred by SITS in continuing a skeleton operation, $219,899 for unpaid invoices by the Government in relation with the voters list of 1999, $44,678,462 for sub-contractors\u2019 claims, and the return of the performance bond.\n\n387.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the claim on account of postexpropriation costs is justified in order to wipe out the consequences of the expropriation. As regards the sub-contractors\u2019 claims, Argentina has affirmed to have taken the necessary measures to ensure that these claims are transferred to Argentina. The Tribunal acknowledges this affirmation and decides that Argentina shall hold the Claimant, its subsidiaries and affiliates, wherever located, harmless from, and indemnify same in respect of, any claims heretofore or hereafter asserted against any of them by any of the following subcontractors to SITS in relation to the Contract: Boldt S.A., Correo Argentino S.A., Printrak International/Printrak de Argentina S.R.L., Imaging Automation Inc., Impsat S.A., SWIPCO Argentina S.A., Mojacar S.A., Indra Spain and Indra Argentina, and Oracle.\n\n388.\n\nSince the Contract was terminated on grounds other than performance, it is congruent that the performance bond be returned promptly to Siemens or SITS, as its agent for this purpose. Should the bond not have been returned 30 days after the date of this Award, Argentina shall pay the Claimant the amount of the bond.\n\n389.\n\nAs for the amount claimed on account of services rendered and unpaid, the Tribunal considers that, since such amount is not disputed and would normally be considered an asset forming part of the value of the investment, the Respondent shall compensate Siemens for the full amount claimed.\n\n**g) Interest**\n---------------\n\n390.\n\nThe Claimant has requested that the Tribunal award compound interest at the rate of 6% per annum and that interest accrue as from May 18, 2001 for compensation on account of the expropriated investment and as from the date costs were incurred in the case of compensation for additional damages. The Lemar Report takes into account a number of options before arriving at the conclusion that 6% would be an appropriate rate to apply based on the consideration that this is the rate that Siemens used as its average corporate borrowing rate in appraising investments and in considering funding costs in 2001-2003. The rate of 6% has also been advanced in Professor Schreuer\u2019s opinion on the basis of arbitral practice.\n\n391.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent does not comment on the issue of the applicable rate of interest. In its Rejoinder, Argentina simply disputes the rate of interest claimed since the Treaty provides that interest be paid at \"the usual bank rate.\" No alternative interest rate is proposed nor is any reason adduced to question how the Claimant has arrived at that rate. Argentina seems to presume that \"the usual bank rate\" would be different but without specifying what this bank rate should be.\n\n392.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent objects to the award of compound interest, it considers that this is an inappropriate case for awarding compound interest without offering reasons why this would be so, and responds to the Claimant\u2019s assertion that compounding of interest is in line with the principle of full damages as follows:\n\n\"That may theoretically be the case if in fact the investor has borrowed elsewhere to make good the loss of the money which it is said it should have received. But nowhere is it claimed that this Claimant was obliged to make good any financial losses by itself borrowing money at compound interest rates from banks. Thus, the claim for loss of the interest on interest which it is said would have been earned is unfounded in fact as well as being entirely speculative. This element of the Claim amounts to an attempt by the Claimant to unjustly enrich itself in the circumstances of this case.\"146\n\nRejoinder, para. 727. Footnote deleted\n\n393.\n\nArgentina further objects to the date of 18 May 2001 as the date from which interest would accrue. It argues that, since the Treaty is silent on this point, it would be artificial to attribute most losses as from that date and speculative and complex to establish dates when the additional damages occurred.\n\n394.\n\nThe Tribunal will address first the applicable rate of interest, then turn to the questions of the date as from which interest should accrue and whether interest should be simple or compounded.\n\n395.\n\nAs an expression of customary international law, Article 38 of the Draft Articles states:\n\n\"1. Interest on any principal sum payable under this Chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.\n\n2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.\"\n\n396.\n\nThus, in determining the applicable interest rate, the guiding principle is to ensure \"full reparation for the injury suffered as a result of the internationally wrongful act.\"147 The Tribunal considers that the rate of interest to be taken into account is not the rate associated with corporate borrowing but the interest rate the amount of compensation would have earned had it been paid after the expropriation. Since the awarded compensation is in dollars, the Tribunal considers that the average rate of interest applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit is an appropriate rate of interest. The average of such rate from May 18, 2001 to September 30, 2006 is 2.66%.148\n\nJ. Crawford, *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility. Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (2002) p. 239.\n\nCalculated on the basis of data published by Bloomberg.\n\n397.\n\nFor purposes of erasing the effects of the expropriation, interest should accrue from the date the Tribunal has found that expropriation occurred, namely, May 18, 2001, in respect of the book value of the investments made for the Project up to that date. Compensation for post-expropriation costs incurred after May 18, 2001 should accrue interest as from the date on which they were incurred. Since this would not be practical for calculation purposes given the multiple dates involved, the Tribunal considers that interest on post-expropriation costs shall accrue as of January 1, 2002, date by which most of these costs had been incurred ($9,339,863 out of a total claimed of $9,807,638). As for interest on unpaid Government bills, interest should accrue from January 1, 2000 since they relate to services rendered in 1999.\n\n398.\n\nIn the eventuality that Siemens or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries would be held liable for any of the claims of the sub-contractors related to the Contract, interest shall accrue from the date of payment of any such claim. Furthermore, in the eventuality that the performance bond is not returned by the Respondent within 30 days of the dispatch of this Award to the parties, interest shall accrue on the amount of the bond as from 30 days after the date of dispatch of this Award to the parties and until such amount has been fully paid.\n\n399.\n\nAs regards compounding of interest, the question is not, as argued by Argentina, whether Siemens had paid compound interest on borrowed funds during the relevant period but whether, had compensation been paid following the expropriation, Siemens would have earned interest on interest paid on the amount of compensation. It is in this sense that tribunals have ruled that compound interest is a closer measure of the actual value lost by an investor. As expressed by the tribunal in *Santa Elena'.*\n\n\"[w]here an owner of property has at some earlier time lost the value of his asset but has not received the monetary equivalent that then became due to him, the amount of compensation should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest.\"149\n\n*Santa Elena,* para. 104.\n\n400.\n\nSimilarly have held the tribunals in *Metalclad* and *Wena Hotels.* The *Ad Hoc* Committee in *Wena Hotels* decided that it was within the tribunal\u2019s power to take the option of compound interest as an alternative compatible with the objectives of prompt, adequate and effective compensation and compensation that reflects the market value of the investment immediately before the expropriation.150\n\n*Wena Hotels,* paras. 52-53.\n\n401.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that interest shall be compounded and be compounded annually.\n\n**VIII. Costs**\n---------------\n\n402.\n\nIn order to take into account that the Claimant has not fully prevailed in these proceedings, the Tribunal determines that each party shall bear its own legal costs, and that Argentina and Siemens shall be responsible for 75% and 25%, respectively, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n**IX. Decision**\n----------------\n\n403.\n\nHaving carefully considered the parties\u2019 arguments in their written pleadings and oral submissions and for the reasons above stated the Tribunal unanimously decides:\n\n1. that the Respondent breached Article 4(2) of the Treaty by expropriating Claimant\u2019s investment without complying with its terms;\n\n2. that the Respondent breached Articles 2(1) and 4(1) of the Treaty by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment and full protection and legal security to the investment of the Claimant;\n\n3. that the Respondent has breached Article 2(3) of the Treaty by the arbitrary measures taken in respect of the investment of the Claimant;\n\n4. that the Respondent shall pay forthwith to the Claimant compensation in the amount of $208,440,540 on account of the value of its investment, $9,178,000 on account of consequential damages and $219,899 on account of unpaid bills for services rendered by SITS to the Government;\n\n5. that the Respondent shall forthwith, and in no event later than thirty (30) days from the date of dispatch of this Award to the parties, deliver to Claimant (or SITS as its agent for this purpose) the Contract performance bond provided by SITS (insurance policy No. 000589772) for an amount of $20 million);\n\n6. that the Respondent shall hold the Claimant, its subsidiaries and affiliates, wherever located, harmless from, and indemnify same in respect of, any claims heretofore or hereafter asserted against any of them by any of the following subcontractors to SITS in relation to the Contract: Boldt S.A., Correo Argentino S.A., Printrak International/Printrak de Argentina S.R.L., Imaging Automation Inc., Impsat S.A., SWIPCO Argentina S.A., Mojacar S.A., Indra Spain and Indra Argentina, and Oracle;\n\n7. that the Respondent shall pay to the Claimant interest compounded annually on the sums listed in point 4 of this decision at the rate of 2.66%, which is the average rate applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit from May 18, 2001 to September 30, 2006; such interest to accrue as from May 18, 2001 in the case of compensation on account of the value of the investment, January 1, 2000 in the case of compensation on account of unpaid bills by the Government, and January 1, 2002 in the case of compensation on account of consequential damages, all until the date of dispatch of this Award to the parties;\n\n8. that, in the eventuality that the Respondent had not paid in full the sums referred to in this decision thirty (30) days after the date of dispatch of this Award to the parties, the Respondent shall pay to the Claimant interest compounded annually on the unpaid sum at the rate set forth in point 7 of this decision; such interest to accrue as from thirty (30) days after the date of dispatch of this Award to the parties until such amount has been fully paid;\n\n9. that the Respondent shall, in the eventuality that the Respondent has not delivered the bond referred to in point 5 of this decision to the Claimant (or SITS as its agent) thirty (30) days after the date of dispatch of this Award to the parties, forthwith pay to the Claimant the full amount of the bond. Such amount to bear interest compounded annually at the rate set forth in point 7 of this decision until fully paid;\n\n10. that the Respondent shall, in the eventuality that Siemens or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries would be held liable for any claims of the sub-contractors listed above, pay interest compounded annually at the rate set forth in point 7 of this decision on any amount paid to satisfy such liability; such interest to accrue from the date of payment of any such amount;\n\n11. that any funds to be paid pursuant to this decision shall be paid in dollars and into an account outside Argentina indicated by the Claimant and net of any taxes and costs;\n\n12. that each party shall bear its own costs and counsel fees;\n\n13. that the Respondent and the Claimant shall be responsible for 75% and 25%, respectively, of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the costs of the ICSID Secretariat; and\n\n14. that all other claims are dismissed."}]}
