THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant is Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. **(\"Blue Bank\"),** a company incorporated under the laws of Barbados. The Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela **(\"Venezuela\").**\n\n**B. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n2.\n\nOn June 25, 2012, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** received a Request for Arbitration filed by Blue Bank against Venezuela.\n\n3.\n\nIn its Request, the Claimant alleged that Venezuela breached the 1994 Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, in force since 1995.\n\n4.\n\nThe Secretary-General registered the Request for Arbitration on August 7, 2012.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of October 8, 2012, the Claimant appointed Mr. Jos\u00e9 Maria Alonso, a national of the Kingdom of Spain, as arbitrator. Mr. Alonso accepted his appointment on October 22, 2012. Copies of Mr. Alonso\u2019s declaration, statement and *curriculum vitae* were circulated to the Parties on October 24, 2013, pursuant to Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings **(\"Arbitration Rules\"****).** Mr. Alonso\u2019s statement indicated as follows:\n\n*\"As of March 2012, I have been a Partner at Baker & McKenzie Madrid, S.L.P. in charge of the Dispute Resolution department in Madrid (Spain).*\n\n*Baker & McKenzie Madrid, S.L.P. is a firm belonging to Baker &**McKenzie International (Swiss Verein). All the firms that form part of Baker & McKenzie International are independent and the remuneration of Partners therefore depends mainly on the turnover of each particular firm.*\n\n*Neither myself nor Baker & McKenzie Madrid, S.L.P. have or have had any relationship with the parties of the proceedings.*\n\n*Notwithstanding the above, I am aware of arbitration proceedings before the ICSID against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in an unrelated matter initiated by Baker & McKenzie New York and Baker &**McKenzie Caracas in 2011, in which they represented a company called Legreef [sic] Investments. As stated above, in spite of belonging to Baker & McKenzie International, both firms are independent from Baker & McKenzie Madrid, S.L.P. and there is no relationship whatsoever between myself or Baker & McKenzie Madrid, S.L.P. and**Legreef [sic] International or the aforementioned arbitration proceedings. Therefore I will not be provided with any information, intervene or take part in said proceedings.*\n\n*I therefore consider myself completely independent and impartial to act as an arbitrator in this [sic] proceedings.\"*\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of November 5, 2012, the Respondent appointed Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez, a national of the Kingdom of Spain, as arbitrator. Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez accepted his appointment on November 15, 2012. Copies of his declaration, statement and *curriculum vitae* were circulated to the Parties on November 16, 2012. Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez\u2019s statement indicated as follows:\n\n*\"Por la presente declaro ser en la actualidad \u00e1rbitro designado por la Rep\u00fablica Argentina en dos casos CIADI, a saber \"Abaclat and others v. Argentine Republic\" (caso CIADI No.ARB/07/5) y \"Giordano Alpi and others v. Argentine Republic (caso CIADI No.ARB/08/9)\".*\n\n*No he tenido ni tengo ninguna [sic] tipo de relaci\u00f3n con el Demandante o la Demandada en el presente caso y ni yo ni mi familia tenemos inversiones u otros intereses econ\u00f3micos en VENEZUELA y/o BARBADOS.\"*\n\n7.\n\nOn November 5, 2012, Respondent submitted a proposal to disqualify Mr. Alonso pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States **(\"Convention\")** and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules **(\"Respondent\u2019s November 5 Letter\").** This proposal was filed before the constitution of the Tribunal. The Centre confirmed receipt on November 9, 2012.\n\n8.\n\nOn May 3, 2013, the Centre reminded the Parties that no steps had been taken towards the constitution of the Tribunal, since the appointment of Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez.\n\n9.\n\nOn May 4, 2013, the Claimant requested that the President of the Tribunal be designated by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council **(\"Chairman\").** By letter of May 23, 2013, the Secretary-General proposed five candidates to the Parties to be considered as the presiding arbitrator. None of these proposals resulted in a mutually agreeable candidate.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 12, 2013, and before the Tribunal had been constituted, the Claimant submitted a proposal to disqualify Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 **(\"Claimant\u2019s June 12 Letter\").** In this letter, the Claimant indicated that Mr. Alonso and Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez would be a majority of the members of the tribunal (once constituted) and, accordingly, requested that the Chairman decide the challenges in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9.\n\n11.\n\nOn 2 July 2013, the Centre informed the Parties of its understanding that the intent of both Parties was to treat Respondent\u2019s November 5 Letter and Claimant\u2019s June 12 Letter as a proposal for disqualification of the majority of the members of the tribunal, which would be decided by the Chairman in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9. Venezuela confirmed the Centre\u2019s understanding by letter of July 3, 2013. No further comments were received from the Claimant.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of July 31, 2013, the Centre informed the Parties of its intention to propose to the Chairman the appointment of Mr. Christer S\u00f6derlund, a national of the Kingdom of Sweden, as the presiding arbitrator. By letter of August 7, 2013, the Respondent objected to the proposal of Mr. S\u00f6derlund as the presiding arbitrator. The Claimant did not submit observations.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of August 13, 2013, the Centre transmitted to the Parties Mr. S\u00f6derlund\u2019s reply to Respondent\u2019s objections. Having carefully considered the correspondence exchanged on this matter, the Centre informed the Parties that it would proceed with the appointment of Mr. S\u00f6derlund. Mr. S\u00f6derlund accepted his appointment on August 15, 2013.\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on August 16, 2013 in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On the same date, the Centre transmitted the proposals to disqualify Mr. Alonso and Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez to the three members of the Tribunal, declared the proceeding suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), and established a procedural calendar for the Parties\u2019 submissions on the disqualification proposals.\n\n15.\n\nOn August 23, 2013, the Respondent submitted additional observations to Respondent\u2019s November 5 Letter **(\"Respondent\u2019s August 23 Observations\").** The Claimant did not submit additional observations.\n\n16.\n\nOn September 2, 2013, the Parties requested an extension to file their second round of observations until September 12, 2013. The Parties\u2019 request was granted on September 3,2013.\n\n17.\n\nOn September 2, 2013, Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez submitted a letter to the Centre (i) furnishing explanations in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3) **(\"Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez\u2019s Explanations\")** and (ii) submitting his resignation in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2). The Centre circulated this letter to the Parties, to Mr. Alonso, and to Mr. S\u00f6derlund on September 6, 2013.\n\nOn September 9, 2013, Mr. Alonso furnished explanations in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3) **(\"Mr. Alonso\u2019s Explanations\").** The Centre circulated Mr. Alonso\u2019s explanations to the Parties and to Mr. S\u00f6derlund on the same date.\n\n18.\n\nOn September 9, 2013, the Parties were invited to submit simultaneous observations on any of the documents filed regarding the proposals to disqualify Mr. Alonso and Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez by September 19, 2013. On September 19, 2013, Respondent submitted its observations **(\"Respondent\u2019s September 19 Observations\").** On the same date, the Claimant submitted its observations in two separate documents: one document dealing with the resignation of Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez and another document relating to the proposed disqualification of Mr. Alonso **(\"Claimant\u2019s September 19 Observations\").**\n\n19.\n\nOn October 4, 2013, the Parties were invited to submit reply observations, including arguments regarding the standard for disqualification under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and its application to the present case by October 11, 2013.\n\n20.\n\nOn October 10, 2013, the Claimant requested an extension of time to submit its reply observations. The Centre granted an extension of time to both Parties until October 24, 2013. Respondent submitted its reply observations on October 24, 2013 **(\"Respondent\u2019s October 24 Observations\").** No additional comments were received from Claimant.\n\n**C. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND OBSERVATIONS BY MR. ALONSO AND DR. TORRES BERN\u00c1RDEZ**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe facts, arguments and observations presented in relation to Mr. Alonso (I) and Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez (II) are summarized below.\n\n**I. Mr. Jos\u00e9 Maria Alonso**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent\u2019s arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n22.\n\nRespondent\u2019s proposed disqualification of Mr. Alonso is based on his position at Baker & McKenzie, a firm that represents the claimant investor in the case *Longreef Investments A. V. V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/5) ***(\"Longreef*** v. ***Venezuela\")*** through its offices in New York and Caracas.\n\n23.\n\nIn particular, Mr. Alonso is (i) a Managing Partner of the Litigation and Arbitration Department of Baker & McKenzie Madrid and (ii) a Member of the Steering Committee of the Global Arbitration Practice Group and the Steering Committee of the Baker & McKenzie International European Dispute Practice Group. In addition, Respondent alleged that the office of Baker & McKenzie in Caracas represents complainants in administrative proceedings against the State.1\n\nRespondent\u2019s November 5 Letter, p. 2\n\n25.\n\nRespondent noted that Baker & McKenzie is structured and publicized as a global legal practice, and that each office cannot be considered as a separate legal person for the purposes of a challenge application. It argued that this conclusion is reinforced by the facts that Mr. Alonso is a member of international or global committees within the global law firm and that part of his remuneration depends on the global returns of the firm.2\n\nRespondent\u2019s September 19 Observations, \u00b6 3; Respondent\u2019s October 24 Observations, \u00b6 7\n\n26.\n\nRespondent argued that the fact that Longreef Investments A.V.V. is a current client of the law firm where Mr. Alonso is a partner is sufficient to give rise to reasonable doubts as to Mr. Alonso\u2019s independence and impartiality, even if Mr. Alonso received minimal remuneration from this client.3 Respondent contended that Mr. Alonso has direct and indirect economic interests in the outcome of these two cases against Venezuela, given that part of his remuneration depends on the results of other firms (including income derived from the *Longreef v. Venezuela* case), and that a favorable result in *Longreef* v. *Venezuela* in addition to a vote favorable to the Claimant in the present case would contribute to the expansion of the practice of Baker & McKenzie in the investment arbitration community.4\n\nRespondent\u2019s September 19 Observations, \u00b6 4\n\nRespondent\u2019s October 24 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5\n\n27.\n\nRespondent argued that Mr. Alonso\u2019s interests are adverse to Venezuela\u2019s interests (*\"relaci\u00f3n adversa\")* because Baker & McKenzie represents interests against Venezuela, and Mr. Alonso is a partner and co-manager of Baker & McKenzie\u2019s global arbitration practice.5\n\nRespondent\u2019s August 23 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 7-10\n\n28.\n\nRespondent noted that in this case Mr. Alonso would be deciding issues similar or identical to those which Baker & McKenzie would be arguing against Venezuela in *Longreef v. Venezuela.6*\n\nRespondent\u2019s August 23 Observations, \u00b6 7\n\n29.\n\nRespondent argued that the potential to challenge judges or arbitrators where there are doubts about their independence or impartiality exists in most legal systems and constitutes a general principle of law under Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.7\n\nRespondent\u2019s November 5 Letter, p. 8-12; Respondent\u2019s October 24 Observations, \u00b6 11\n\n30.\n\nRespondent contended that Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention establish the conditions for the disqualification of arbitrators. Article 14(1) requires that arbitrators \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\".8\n\nRespondent\u2019s November 5 Letter, p. 4; Respondent\u2019s October 24 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13\n\n31.\n\nRespondent contended that any reasonable person would have justifiable doubts as to whether an arbitrator that coordinates the global arbitration practice of a firm could sign an award rejecting arguments that are being defended by other partners of the same firm against the same respondent.9\n\nRespondent\u2019s November 5 Letter, p. 6; Respondent\u2019s October 24 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 14 and 22\n\n32.\n\nAccordingly, Respondent requests that Mr. Alonso be disqualified from the Tribunal.\n\n**2. Observations by the Claimant**\n-----------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant stated that no principle of law compels the Chairman to disqualify Mr. Alonso.10 In particular, the Claimant contended that Respondent had mischaracterized the facts and the legal standard.\n\nClaimant\u2019s September 19 Observations, p. 1\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention provide for an objective standard, \"presumably reasonableness\"11, to establish \"manifest lack of impartiality or independence\".12 However, it is claimed that Venezuela had not established any facts demonstrating that Mr. Alonso manifestly lacked impartiality or independence. In addition, it argued that Venezuela could not meet the standard established by the term \"manifest\".\n\n*Id.,p.* 3\n\n*Id.,p.* 5\n\n35.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Venezuela has mischaracterized the structure and functioning of the *Verein* structure of Baker & McKenzie International, Mr. Alonso's status as a partner, and his title and functions as a member of Baker & McKenzie\u2019s International Arbitration Steering Committee.13\n\n*Id.,p.* 9-13\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the legal authorities cited by Venezuela undermine its position because they all emphasize the arbitrator's direct involvement in cases against the State party, whereas no such direct involvement existed or exists with respect to Mr. Alonso.14\n\n*Id.,* p. 13\n\n37.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant requests that the Chairman deny Respondent\u2019s proposal to disqualify Mr. Alonso.\n\n**3. Explanations by Mr. Alonso**\n---------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nMr. Alonso states that there is no reason to disqualify him from serving as an arbitrator in this case. In particular, he notes that the firm where he is a partner, Baker & McKenzie Madrid, and the firms that represent Longreef Investments A.V.V. against Venezuela, Baker & McKenzie New York and Caracas, are separate legal entities that function independently, and that he does not lead the global arbitration practice of Baker & McKenzie. Mr. Alonso states that his partnership in Baker & McKenzie Madrid and his membership in Baker & McKenzie\u2019s International Arbitration Steering Committee do not meet the standard for disqualification under the ICSID Convention or the IBA Guidelines.\n\n39.\n\nMr. Alonso states that Baker & McKenzie Madrid, Baker & McKenzie New York and Baker & McKenzie Caracas are members of the Swiss *Verein* Baker & McKenzie International. As explained in the attachment to his declaration, these firms constitute independent legal entities.15\n\nMr. Alonso\u2019s Explanations, \u00b6 1\n\n40.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Alonso states that his income as a partner depends primarily on the results achieved by Baker & McKenzie Madrid, and that the impact on his income of any profit derived by Baker & McKenzie New York and Caracas from the *Longreef v. Venezuela* case would be nonexistent or insignificant.16\n\nId., \u00b62\n\n41.\n\nMr. Alonso further states that Baker & McKenzie Madrid operates with absolute autonomy and does not receive instructions from any other firm.17\n\nId., \u00b6 3\n\n42.\n\nMr. Alonso explains that he is a member of Baker & McKenzie\u2019s International Arbitration Steering Committee. However, he states that he does not co-manage this Committee and that his membership does not mean that he manages Baker & McKenzie\u2019s global arbitration practice. Furthermore, this Committee gives no instructions on the management of individual cases.18\n\nId., \u00b6 3\n\n43.\n\nMr. Alonso states that the standard for disqualification under the ICSID Convention and the IBA Guidelines are different.19 Whereas the ICSID Convention requires manifest lack of impartiality or independence, the IBA Guidelines require only justifiable doubts. He states that neither of these standards is met in this case.\n\nId.,\u00b65\n\n44.\n\nMr. Alonso concludes that there is no basis to find reasonable doubt as to his capacity to act impartially, especially given that he does not or has never personally represented any of the Parties, he has never acted in any case against the Respondent and he has no economic or other interest in the result of the *Longreef v. Venezuela* case.20\n\nId.,\u00b68\n\n**II. Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s proposed disqualification of Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez is based on (i) repeat appointments by the Argentine Republic, and by Venezuela when represented by the former Attorney General *(Procurador del Tesoro) of* the Argentine Republic; and on (ii) Dr. Torres Bem\u00e1rdez\u2019s alleged systematic findings in favor of States.21\n\nClaimant\u2019s June 12 Letter, p. 1\n\n46.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant contends that: (i) in five of the seven investment arbitration cases in which Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez has been appointed as an arbitrator, current counsel for Venezuela represented the appointing party;22 (ii) each one of these seven appointments was made by a respondent State;23 and (iii) there is no published decision on any significant issue in which Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez has ruled against the party that appointed him.24\n\n*Id., p.* 17-22\n\n*Id.,* p. 3\n\n*Id.,p.* 3,22-27\n\n47.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the reference to \"independent judgment\" in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention has been interpreted as including a requirement of impartiality, and the term \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention is generally acknowledged to mean \"obvious\" or \"evident\", and imposing a relatively heavy burden of proof on the challenging party.25\n\n*Id.,* p. 4-7\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the IBA Guidelines and on several decisions issued by ICSID tribunals to determine whether the facts in the present case could lead a reasonable person to conclude that an arbitrator lacks independence or impartiality.26 The Claimant contends that the present case differs from the cases it refers to27 because the facts in the present case demonstrate actual bias as opposed to the appearance of bias that was argued but not substantiated in those other cases.28\n\n*Id.,* p. 8-10\n\nRespondent\u2019s August 23 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4 and 5; Respondent\u2019s September 19 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 6-11; Respondent\u2019s October 24 Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17\n\nClaimant\u2019s June 12 Letter, p. 15\n\n49.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant requests that Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez be disqualified from the Tribunal.\n\n**2. Observations by the Respondent**\n-------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent contends that no comments are necessary in light of Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez\u2019s resignation from the Tribunal.29\n\nRespondent\u2019s September 19 Observations, \u00b6 2\n\n**3. Explanations by Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nTogether with his resignation, Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez submitted explanations to the Claimant\u2019s proposal for his disqualification.\n\n52.\n\nRegarding repeat decisions in favor of respondent States, Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez states that most of those decisions and awards were made unanimously with the other members of the Tribunal30 and that there is no rule that prevents him from issuing dissenting opinions whenever he disagrees with the tribunal.31\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez\u2019s Explanations, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 14-15\n\n53.\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez also states that appointments are made by the parties to the proceedings and not by counsel representing those parties, and that the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules do not limit the number of times that a party may appoint the same arbitrator.32 In any case, Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez states that Mr. Guglielmino was representing the appointing party in only three of the seven cases where Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez was appointed as an arbitrator.33\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 21-24\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 26-27\n\n54.\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez states that he is independent34 and that he has never had any personal, professional or other kind of relationship with Respondent\u2019s counsel.35\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 12, 29-30\n\nId., \u00b6 26\n\n**D. DECISION BY THE CHAIRMAN**\n-------------------------------\n\n**I. The applicable legal standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads as follows:\n\n*\"A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition,**propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of**Chapter IV.\"*\n\n56.\n\nThe disqualifications proposed in this case allege a manifest *\"lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\"* of two of the members of the Tribunal. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address disqualification *\"on the ground that [an arbitrator] was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter TV\".*\n\n57.\n\nArticle 14(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*\"Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\"*\n\n58.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to *\"independent judgment,\"36* the Spanish version requires *\"imparcialidad de juicio\"* (impartiality of judgment). Given that both versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.37\n\nThe French version refers to *\"ind\u00e9pendance dans l\u2019exercice de leurs fonctions\"*\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v.

While these rules or guidelines may serve as useful references, the Chairman is bound by the standard set forth in the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, this decision is made in accordance with Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**II. Timeliness**\n------------------\n\n63.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1) requires that the party proposing a challenge under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention must do so *\"promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed\".*\n\n64.\n\nIn a number of ICSID cases, the disputing parties announced their intention to challenge an arbitrator before the tribunal had been constituted. In these instances, the Centre reminded the parties that the tribunal is not constituted, and the proceeding does not begin, until the Secretary-General has notified the parties that all arbitrators have accepted their appointments.45 A challenge becomes effective only after this notification has been made.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1)\n\n65.\n\nIn this case, the Parties filed their proposals to disqualify Mr. Alonso and Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez before the Tribunal was constituted. While these challenges did not become effective until the Tribunal was constituted, there is no doubt that both challenges were filed *\"promptly\"* in the sense of ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n**III. The challenge of Mr. Alonso**\n------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe following facts are undisputed: (i) Mr. Alonso is a partner in Baker & McKenzie Madrid; (ii) Baker & McKenzie New York and Baker & McKenzie Caracas represent the claimant in a parallel proceeding against the Respondent *(Longreef v. Venezuela)-,* (iii) Mr. Alonso has no direct involvement in the parallel *Longreef v. Venezuela* case; and (iv) Mr. Alonso is a member of Baker & McKenzie\u2019s International Arbitration Steering Committee.\n\n67.\n\nThe sharing of a corporate name, the existence of an international arbitration steering committee at a global level, and Mr. Alonso\u2019s statement that his remuneration depends \"primarily\" but not exclusively on the results achieved by the Madrid firm imply a degree of connection or overall coordination between the different firms comprising Baker & McKenzie International.\n\n68.\n\nIn addition, given the similarity of issues likely to be discussed in *Longreef v. Venezuela* and the present case and the fact that both cases are ongoing, it is highly probable that Mr. Alonso would be in a position to decide issues that are relevant in *Longreef v. Venezuela* if he remained an arbitrator in this case.\n\n69.\n\nIn view of the above, the Chairman concludes that it has been demonstrated that a third party would find an evident or obvious appearance of lack of impartiality on a reasonable evaluation of the facts in this case. Accordingly, the Chairman finds that Mr. Alonso manifestly lacks one of the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention in this particular case.\n\n**IV. The challenge of Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nDr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez has resigned from the Tribunal. As a result, it is no longer necessary to address the proposal for his disqualification, which is accordingly dismissed.\n\n**E. CONCLUSIONS**\n------------------\n\n71.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Chairman decides as follows:\n\ni. Respondent\u2019s proposal to disqualify Mr. Alonso pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention is upheld.\n\nii.

However, I do believe that the role of Article 72 of the Convention \u2013 which forms the centrepiece of the Respondent's first-hand objection \u2013 as regards obligations based on unilateral consent could merit a more exhaustive analysis as to how it will play out in an investment treaty context.\n\n2.\n\nI also believe that the matter of jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* in a BIT context \u2013 like the present one \u2013 may well deserve a fuller discussion in view of the diversity of opinion that reigns in this area in the wake of the decision by Bolivia as the first Contracting State to withdraw from the ICSID Convention in 2007.\n\n**Background**\n--------------\n\n3.\n\nAs for the normative framework, I am in agreement with the presentation made in Section 6.3.1 of the Award but for the fact that also Article 72 of the ICSID Convention is necessarily a part of that framework.\n\n4.\n\nAs for the chronology of Section 6.3.2, I am also in agreement although, for reasons given below, I consider it of no relevance for my conclusion.\n\n**Points of departure**\n-----------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe ICSID Convention provides an arbitration regime for purposes of settling international investment disputes between Contracting States and investors of other Contracting States. Its application is limited to cross-border investments. These basic criteria are laid down in Article 25 which, in the relevant part, provides:\n\n**Article 25**\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n6.\n\nIn line with what has just been stated, a key element of the ICSID Convention is that adherence by itself does not oblige the Contracting State to submit to arbitration (under the ICSID regime or otherwise). This key element is emphasized already in the Preamble, seventh indentation:\n\n**Declaring** that no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration\n\n7.\n\nFrom  this it follows that consent to arbitration must be given in some other form. At the time the Convention was conceived, such other form was predominantly an investment contract between an investor and the State, national legislation or a submission agreement. It was not undertaken in an investment protection treaty. In contrast, today, in the absolute majority of cases consent will be found in a bi- or multilateral investment protection treaty.\n\n8.\n\nArticle 71 of the Convention deals with a Contracting State's right to withdraw from the Convention. It provides:\n\n**Article 71**\n\nAny Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice to the depositary of this Convention. The denunciation shall take effect six months after receipt of such notice.\n\n9.\n\nArticle 72 of the Convention reads as follows:\n\n**Article 72**\n\nNotice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them before such notice was received by the depositary.\n\n10.\n\nI am in agreement as regards my co-arbitrators' conclusion that the Respondent was bound by its consent to arbitrate at the time when the Claimant submitted its consent to arbitrate. However, I believe that the Respondent's invocation of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention requires analysis.\n\n**Implications of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention in the present context**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent's interpretation of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention is straightforward: The \"consent\" referred to in this provision concerns the unilateral consent given by the State (or its constituent subdivisions, agencies or any national) to submit to ICSID jurisdiction. Consequently, if there is unilateral consent, Article 72 implies that the period during which the State's \"rights or obligations under this Convention [---] arising out of consent\" shall remain in effect ends at the point in time when the State's notice of denunciation is received by the depositary if that consent has not been \"perfected\" by the investor's consent at that time. The Respondent's notice of denunciation was given on 24 January 2012. The Claimant's consent (constituted by its submission of the Request for Arbitration) was given at a time when the Respondent's consent to ICSID arbitration had ceased to apply.1\n\nThe Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 218 *& seq.* ; the Respondent's Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 62 *& seq*.\n\n12.\n\nIn this relation, I make the following observations.\n\n13.\n\nArticle 72 covers the situation in which a denouncing State has unilaterally consented to ICSID jurisdiction prior to giving notice of its denunciation of the Convention.\n\n14.\n\nAccording to the wording of this provision, notice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State (or a constituency or a national) arising out of consent. This implies that unilateral consent may be withdrawn at any time.\n\n15.\n\nThus, the provision of Article 72 stands in harmony with the principle implied by Article 25, that withdrawal shall not be possible once there is *mutual* consent.\n\n16.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the question that has to be examined in order to decide whether there is an obligation for the Respondent to submit to arbitration is whether Article 72 applies at all to the situation at hand.\n\n**Implications of denunciation of the ICSID Convention**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe matter concerning the effect on the investor's consent to arbitration of Article 72 has been subject to intense debate in the investment protection area. This debate was originally triggered by Bolivia's denunciation of the Convention on 2 May 2007. Different interpretations have been advocated.2 One such interpretation would coincide with the view held by the Respondent, *i.e.* that in the absence of investor consent at the time when the depositary receives the State party's notice of denunciation, no basis for ICSID arbitration remains. A second reading of Article 72 (which is that of my co-arbitrators) may conceivably imply that investors may still accept the consent given in a BIT until the denunciation becomes effective in accordance to Article 71, *i.e.* six months after the depositary has received the denouncing State party's notice of denunciation. A third view is that ICSID arbitration will be available as long as the State's consent, if expressed in a BIT, remains effective for the duration of the BIT.\n\nC.

A previous case, *E T I Euro* *Telecom International N.V. v Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/28, would also have had to address this issue but was discontinued by the claimant.\n\n**Applying Article 72 in a BIT context**\n----------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThere is reason to believe that the great diversity of opinion that has been expressed in writings and commentary on the implications of Article 72 stems from the fact that the drafters of the ICSID Convention did not shape its provisions in contemplation of the subsequent State practice of offering investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) by way of investment protection treaties.\n\n20.\n\nAt the time the ICSID Convention was drafted in the beginning of the sixties, no BIT with an investor-State mechanism was in existence. There existed a Germany \u2013 Pakistan BIT which had been concluded as early as in 1959, but that treaty did not include an ISDS mechanism.\n\n21.\n\nInstead, consent to arbitration by States in relation to foreign investors was predominantly provided in the form of an arbitration clause entered into by the State itself, such as in a natural resource concession or a foreign investment agreement. At the time of the drafting of the Convention, it was also recognized that States could give consent to arbitrate future disputes by offering to submit to arbitration in a foreign investment law or by a treaty. However, up to 1968, *i.e.* after the Convention had entered into effect, BITs provided only for State-to-State dispute resolution through the establishment of \"mixed\" commissions or by submission of a dispute to the ICJ. According to Newcombe and Paradell \"[i]t appears that the first BIT that expressly incorporates provisions for investor-State arbitration, though with qualifications, is Indonesia-Netherlands (1968)\". By the same source, it appears that the Tchad-Italy BIT was the first BIT \u2013 in 1969 \u2013 that provided for investor-State arbitration with unqualified State consent.4\n\nNewcombe, Paradell, *Law and Practice of Investment Treaties*, Kluwer 2009\n\n22.\n\nAlthough a few more BITs were entered into in the beginning of the seventies, it would take a long time before the ISDS mechanism of such instruments was put into actual operation; the effectiveness of a unilateral arbitration offer contained in a treaty was first upheld in 1985 in *SPP v. Egypt*.5\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 November 1985\n\n23.\n\nAccording to Newcombe and Paradell, in the period 1970-1974, no more than 39 BITs were concluded; between 1975 and 1979, 60 BITs were concluded. The 1990's witnessed a proliferation in the number of BITs. At the end of the decade, there were almost 2,000 BITs concluded.\n\n24.\n\nThe above overview demonstrates that the investor-State arbitration option that represents the absolutely predominant basis for investor-State arbitration in the last few decades did not exist at all at the time when the ICSID Convention was opened for ratification. This circumstance gives reason to assume that the provisions of the Convention were drafted without regard to the existence of \"arbitration without privity\" grounded in investment protection treaties. As a consequence, the provisions of the Convention will nowadays have to be regularly applied in a contextual framework that did not exist at the time of the Convention's creation.\n\n25.\n\nThe task in front of which the Tribunal is placed is, therefore, to determine the relevance of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention in a context which did not exist at the time when the Convention came into existence, and which its drafters did not have occasion to consider.\n\n26.\n\nIn order to arrive at the appropriate application of Article 72 in the relevant context in this arbitration, it is necessary to depart from a number of fundamental premises.\n\n27.\n\nThe consent of Venezuela that the Claimant relies on for purposes of this arbitration is premised on Article 8(1) of the BIT. Article 8 deals with the \"Settlement of Disputes Between one Contracting Party and Nationals or Companies of the other Contracting Party\".\n\n1. Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965.\n\n28.\n\nThis declaration of consent of the Respondent and Barbados entered into effect on 31 October 1995. According to its terms \u2013 Article 13 \u2013 it was to remain in effect for an initial period of ten years and thereafter be subject to termination twelve months after either Party's notice of termination. For investments made during the term of the BIT, a sunset period of ten years applies.\n\n29.\n\nThe BIT had not been terminated at the time when the Claimant submitted its Request for Arbitration.\n\n30.\n\nThe inquiry which has to be undertaken is the following: Does the presence of the BIT constitute a circumstance that will deprive the State of its right to immediately withdraw its consent to arbitration?\n\n31.\n\nThe following observations may provide an appropriate point of departure.\n\n32.\n\nNormally, doctrinal writings will assume that an analogy with the \"offer-acceptance\" principle found in municipal law offers a workable model for explaining how the investor's entitlement to submit disputes to international arbitration is fashioned in a BIT context. Applying this model, some scholars have concluded that the arbitration agreement is not \"perfected\" until the investor submits its consent, at which time the State's unilateral consent may no longer apply according to Article 72 of the Convention.\n\n33.\n\nHowever, this explanation model, on closer scrutiny, represents an approximation which does not lead to the appropriate inferences in all instances.6 It may elicit, erroneously, a perception of the existence of an offer-acceptance relationship between the contracting State and investors of the other contracting State, to the exclusion of the basic State-to-State relationship grounded in the treaty. This, in its turn, may lead to a misapplication in the specific instance of Article 72, as it assumes that there is a unilateral consent given, which will not be perfected until such time as when a particular \"investor\" declares its consent, *i.e.* accepts the offer.\n\nOr, in the language of one Tribunal: \"[\u2026] While it is common and often harmless to somewhat loosely refer to dispute resolution clauses such as Article VII of the BIT as provisions containing the State parties' \u2018standing offer' to arbitrate, this is in fact conceptually inaccurate and legally incorrect; Article VII rather contains the State parties' \u2018consent' to arbitrate, which is binding on the State as such, without any further \u2018perfecting', as a unilateral undertaking *vis-\u00e0-vis* a class of foreign investors.\" *i\u00e7kale insaat Limited Sirketi v* *Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/24, Award, March 8, 2016, \u00b6 244.\n\n**Interpreting Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention in a BIT context**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nContributing to this interpretation (that there is only unilateral consent until such time as the investor has \"accepted\" the offer) is, no doubt, the wording of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention in that it provides that \"[w]hen the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally\" where the identity of \"the parties\" refers to the parties to the dispute which, in a BIT context, are the host State and the investor.\n\n35.\n\nA literal application of this language leads to the conclusion that there is unilateral consent only as long as the investor has not given its reciprocal consent to arbitrate.\n\n36.\n\nHowever, such literal interpretation fails to take into account the situation which existed at the time when the text of the Convention was conceived. The mutual consent (which cannot be withdrawn under this Article) was invariably given in an investment contract or an *ad hoc* submission agreement,7*i.e*. the contracting parties and the potential disputants were the same. The notion of an inter-State investment treaty was not contemplated in a way so as to accommodate the exigencies of consent given by way of an inter-State undertaking.8\n\nIt is notable that the Report of Executive Directors as examples of giving consent mentioned \"an investment agreement\", a \"*compromis*\" or \u2013 as an example of a unilateral offer of consent \u2013 \"investment promotion legislation\" (Article 24 of the Report).\n\nOne tribunal \u2013 in an early award of 1999 \u2013 was prescient in the way that it observed \"En ce qui concerne la comp\u00e9tence du CIRDI \u2013 et, par voie de cons\u00e9quence, celle du Tribunal arbitral \u2013 elle trouve sa source non pas dans un accord conclu entre l'Etat d'accueil et l'investisseur \u00e9tranger mais directement dans le trait\u00e9 international conclu entre l'Etat d'accueil et l'Etat national de l'investisseur. L'exigence fondamentale du consentement des parties, formul\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 25 de la Convention du CIRDI, se trouve ainsi rev\u00eatir une expression originale, \u00e0 laquelle on ne pensait gu\u00e8re au moment de l'\u00e9laboration de la Convention du CIRDI, \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 la pratique des trait\u00e9s bilat\u00e9raux d'investissement \u00e9tait encore embryonnaire. La pr\u00e9sente affaire est la seconde seulement dans la jurisprudence du CIRDI \u00e0 se situer dans un tel cadre. Nul doute, cependant, qu'une situation de ce genre se pr\u00e9sentera de plus en plus fr\u00e9quemment dans l'avenir.\" [As far as ICSID 's competence - and, as a consequence, that of the Arbitral Tribunal - is concerned, it derives not from an agreement between the host State and the foreign investor but directly from the international treaty between the host State and the national State of the investor. The basic requirement of consent of the parties, as set out in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, thus finds its expression in a novel fashion, which was hardly thought of at the time of the ICSID Convention, at one time where the practice of bilateral investment treaties was still embryonic. The present case is the second only in ICSID jurisprudence to fall within such a framework. There is no doubt, however, that a situation of this kind will occur more and more frequently in the future] [President's translation], *Antoine Goetz et al v R\u00e9publique du Burundi*, ICSID Case No. ARB/95/3, Award, 10 February 1999, \u00b6 67.\n\n37.\n\nIn view of this changing landscape as concerns the modalities of consent, it is necessary to interpret the Convention text in appreciation of the form of States' consent to submit to international arbitration at the behest of third party investors that now has come to prevail.\n\n38.\n\nFrom the foregoing it follows that the Convention's reference to a dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State cannot allow the conclusion that as long as that \"national of another Contracting State\" has not \"accepted\" the unilateral consent, a situation of unilateral consent as foreseen in Article 72 is present. The undertaking of obligations in relation to another contracting State (in a BIT) is of an enduring nature and constitutes a binding commitment under international law for the term of the applicable treaty.\n\n**The dispute resolution chapter of a BIT constitutes mutual consent for purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe BIT is an international instrument which creates rights and obligations for the contracting States. Although intended to bring substantive and procedural benefits to third parties \u2013 \"investors\" \u2013such third-party rights must also be regarded as being owed by the contracting States to each other. By the same token it also imposes on the contracting States the obligation to provide a forum at the request of \"investors\" of the other contracting State.\n\n40.\n\nAs concerns the effectiveness of obligations undertaken by one State in relation to another State as compared with any undertaking ultimately intended to benefit a third party, there is no difference from the point of view of its obligatory character. The binding nature of each category of undertakings (whether procedural or substantive) is the same, and both are owed by each contracting State to the other on a reciprocal basis.\n\n41.\n\nSeen from this perspective, it is clear that the States that are parties to investment protection treaties have undertaken to maintain their respective undertakings to observe substantive standards laid down in the relevant treaty, as well as the obligation to submit to international arbitration, on a mutual basis and for the duration of the treaty. This leads to the important consequence that Article 72 does not come into play.\n\n42.\n\nHowever, even if one does not accept the mutuality basis of an investment protection treaty, but consider the \"offer-acceptance\" model as a proper explanatory model for the investor-State relationship, such \"offer\" would then \u2013 until the moment of acceptance by an investor \u2013 represent a unilateral undertaking. Such undertaking would have been undertaken for the duration of the treaty, and Article 72 would not apply. To quote the words of Prof Schreuer, \"[a] mere offer of consent to ICSID's jurisdiction may be withdrawn at any time, unless, of course, it is irrevocable by its own terms.\"9\n\nSchreuer *et al*, *The ICSID Convention, A Commentary*, second edition, Article 25, \u00b6 599.\n\n**Relevance of the** ***travaux*** **for the BIT context**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nIn this relation, there is reason to comment on Mr Broches' statement that only the unilateral consent by the State which has not been accepted by the investor at the time of withdrawal from the Convention by the State implies that \"no investor could later bring a claim before the Centre.\" This statement has been understood by some scholars to imply that the absence of investor consent at the time of the State's denunciation precludes access to arbitration. However, it is clear to see that the situation addressed by Mr Broches is not one where the State is bound by a BIT with an investor-State dispute settlement mechanism in relation to another State as such instruments simply were not on offer at that time. The question (paragraph 61) relates to \"a general declaration\" and Mr Broches also responds on the premise of a \"general statement of the kind mentioned by [the proponent].\"\n\n44.\n\nIt is clear that Mr Broches did not and could not provide an answer based on the assumption of a \u2013 at the time non-existing \u2013 mutual agreement between States to, *inter alia*, offer the nationals of their counterparties international arbitration for an agreed period of time. The situation was different. It concerned a general declaration that could only be conceived as directing itself towards an investor to submit to arbitration; such declaration would not involve any other State and did not concern an offer of arbitration which was undertaken for any specific period of time.\n\n45.\n\nThe conclusion that the above observations compel is that a notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention is of no consequence for consent given by a State party in a BIT in relation to another State. Such consent (whether regarded as unilateral or mutual) will remain in effect for the duration of the BIT. In other words, the availability of ICSID arbitration will remain open not only for the six-month period, which according to Article 71 of the Convention follows on the notice of denunciation, but also until such time as the relevant BIT is terminated.\n\n**Access to ICSID arbitration post-termination?**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe above conclusion prompts the following inquiry. The enduring nature of consent given in a BIT may lead to a situation where an investor will wish to submit to ICSID arbitration at a time when the host State (or even both Contracting States) is no longer a party to the ICSID Convention. The fact that such membership is a prerequisite according to Article 25(1) of the Convention for arbitral jurisdiction, coupled with the principle \u2013 also enunciated in Article 25(1) \u2013 that mutual consent cannot be withdrawn \u2013necessitates an inquiry into whether recourse to ICSID arbitration (which requires that the concerned State parties are signatories of the Convention) is still possible.\n\n47.\n\nA look into the drafting history of the ICSID Convention reveals that the implications of denunciation on consent in a comparable situation were raised only shortly before the Convention was opened for signature.\n\n48.\n\nThe question that was raised was whether a \"perfected\" agreement between a State and an investor (an \"investment contract\") would survive denunciation of the Convention. This might imply that a State Party might have to arbitrate before the ICSID even decades after its adherence to the ICSID Convention had come to an end. Mr Broches confirmed that the State would be so obliged.\n\n54. Mr. Broches replied that the intention of Article 73 [now Article 72 of the ICSID Convention] in the text submitted to the Directors was to make it clear that if a State has consented to arbitration, for instance by entering into an arbitration clause with an investor, the subsequent denunciation of the Convention by that State would not relieve it from its obligation to go to arbitration if a dispute arose.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n57. Mr. Mejia-Palacio asked what would happen if a State which was a party to the Convention signed an agreement with a company and later withdrew from the Centre while no disputes were pending. If, say ten years later a dispute arose \u2013 would that dispute still be under the jurisdiction of the Centre?\n\n58. Mr. Broches replied that if the agreement with the company included an arbitration clause and that agreement lasted for say 20 years, that State would still be bound to submit its disputes with that company under that agreement to the Centre.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n49.\n\nThis statement provides support for the assumption that the ICSID would register a request for arbitration also where a State party had left the Convention but where the investor could invoke a former Contracting State's consent to ICSID arbitration by a valid BIT.\n\n50.\n\nHowever, this unequivocal declaration still raises the following quandary.\n\n51.\n\nICSID is created as an administrative facility for purposes of serving dispute settlement by way of (conciliation and) arbitration. It is central that ICSID is not a \"free for all\" institution that will serve all disputants in all matters, but exclusively, Article 1(2), \"between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States\" in respect of cross-border investment.\n\n52.\n\nThis circumstance is not without importance (but with no relevance for any conclusion to be made), as an investor deprived of recourse to ICSID arbitration under this particular BIT would have no recourse in international arbitration at all.10\n\nThis *impasse* is illustrated by *Venezuela US, srl v Venezuela*, PCA No. 2013-34, on my assumption that other recourse cannot be had on the basis of the MFN clause.\n\n53.\n\nAlready in its Preamble, second indentation, the Convention notes that \"\u2026disputes [\u2026] between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States\", and, of course, in Article 25 of the Convention, it is made clear that it is open for \"Contracting State[s] [\u2026] and [\u2026] national[s] of [other] Contracting State[s]\".\n\n54.\n\nParticipation in the Convention of the State parties is an absolute requirement; it is not subject to waiver by agreement between the parties.11 The relevant time of membership in the Convention is the point in time when proceedings in a particular case are initiated. After expiry of the six-month notice period, it is clear that the denunciating State party is not any longer a \"Contracting State.\"\n\nSchreuer *et al*, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, Article 25, \u00b6 213.\n\n55.\n\nOne may envisage that principles in international law such as the one of good faith may preserve an investor's right to access to ICSID arbitration where the State has undertaken to maintain that promise for the duration of a particular BIT.\n\n56.\n\nThe fact that a post-termination request under a BIT would be registered at the ICSID does not answer the question whether a tribunal would consider itself competent to deal with the dispute. It would not be appropriate to delve into that issue for purposes of the present case where I share my co-arbitrators' conclusion that the Request was filed within the six-month notice period stipulated in Article 71 of the Convention. The purpose of this opinion is to provide an explanation why Article 72 does not apply in the presence of a BIT and why Venezuela's consent did not expire immediately upon its notice of denunciation as provided in Article 72."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**GLOSSARY OF** **TERMS**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Ansbacher** | Ansbacher (Bahamas) Limited, Bahamas |\n| **BIT or the Treaty** | Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 15 July 1994, Exhibit C-135 |\n| **Blue Bank or Claimant** | Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. |\n| **Brighton** | Brighton Preferred Equity Investments Ltd. |\n| **BVI Companies** | GIM Tour Ltd (BVI) and Western Hemisphere Hotels Ltd (BVI) |\n| **Centre or ICSID** | The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| **Claimant\u2019s Memorial** | Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction and the Merits submitted on 7 September 2014 |\n| **Commentary** | Christopher H.

THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n**1.1 The Claimant**\n--------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant is Blue Bank International and Trust (Barbados) Ltd., a corporation incorporated under the laws of Barbados on 7 June 2002, having its head offices at Braemar Court, Deighton Road, St Michael BB14017, Barbados.1\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 66.\n\n**1.2 The Respondent**\n----------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (jointly with the Claimant, the \"Parties\").2\n\nVenezuela submitted its note of denunciation of the Convention on 24 January 2012.\n\n**2. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn 25 June 2012, the Centre received a Request for Arbitration filed by the Claimant against the Respondent dated 22 June 2012. The Request concerned the alleged expropriation and other violations of the obligations under the BIT3 in relation to Claimant's tourism and hospitality business in Venezuela.\n\nExhibit C-135.\n\n4.\n\nIn the Request, the Claimant invoked Venezuela's consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in Article 8 of the BIT. Also in the Request, the Claimant made a proposal as to the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment.\n\n5.\n\nThe Request, as supplemented by the Claimant's letter of 27 July 2012, was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 7 August 2012 pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention. On the same day, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 7(c) of the ICSID Institution Rules, notified the Parties of the registration and invited them to proceed to constitute the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 8 October 2012, the Claimant invoked the procedure for the constitution of the Tribunal established in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. In the same letter, the Claimant appointed Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Alonso (a Spanish national) as an arbitrator and proposed Prof. George A. Bermann (a US national) as presiding arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nOn 22 October 2012, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Alonso accepted his appointment as coarbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 5 November 2012, the Respondent appointed Dr. Santiago Torres Bern\u00e1rdez (a Spanish national) as an arbitrator and proposed that the President of the Tribunal be appointed by agreement of the co-arbitrators. In a separate letter of the same date, the Respondent indicated its intention to propose the disqualification of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Alonso pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In a letter of 9 November 2012, the Centre informed the Parties that the Centre would transmit the disqualification proposal to the Tribunal as soon as it was constituted.\n\n9.\n\nOn 15 November 2012, Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez accepted his appointment as coarbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nOn 4 May 2013, the Claimant filed a request for the Chairman of the Administrative Council to appoint the presiding arbitrator pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention. By letter of 23 May 2013, the Secretary-General proposed five candidates to the Parties to be considered as the presiding arbitrator. None of these proposals resulted in a mutually agreeable candidate.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 12 June 2013, the Claimant indicated its intention to propose the disqualification of Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9.\n\n12.\n\nOn 2 July 2013, the Centre communicated to the Parties its understanding that the intent of both Parties was to treat the Respondent's 5 November 2012 letter and the Claimant's 12 June 2013 letter as a proposal for disqualification of the majority of the members of the Tribunal, which would be decided by the Chairman of the Administrative Council in accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9. Both Parties agreed with the Centre's understanding.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of 31 July 2013, the Centre informed the Parties of its intention to propose to the Chairman of the Administrative Council the appointment of Mr. Christer S\u00f6derlund, a Swedish national, as the presiding arbitrator. By letter of 7 August 2013, the Respondent objected to the proposal of Mr. S\u00f6derlund as the presiding arbitrator. The Claimant did not submit observations. By letter of 13 August 2013, the Centre transmitted to the Parties Mr. S\u00f6derlund's reply to the Respondent's objections. Having carefully considered the correspondence exchanged on this matter, the Centre informed the Parties that it would proceed with the appointment of Mr. S\u00f6derlund. Mr. S\u00f6derlund accepted his appointment on 15 August 2013.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of 16 August 2013, the Centre informed the Parties that all the arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. Ms. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated by the Secretary-General of ICSID to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nOn the same date, the Centre transmitted copies of the proposals to disqualify Mr. Alonso and Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez to the three members of the Tribunal, declared the proceeding suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), and established a procedural calendar for the Parties' submissions on the disqualification proposals.\n\n16.\n\nOn 23 August 2013, the Respondent submitted additional observations to its disqualification proposal of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Maria Alonso.\n\n17.\n\nOn 2 September 2013, Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez submitted a letter to the Centre (i) furnishing explanations in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3) and (ii) submitting his resignation in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2). The Centre circulated this letter to the Parties, to Mr. Alonso, and to Mr. S\u00f6derlund on 6 September 2013.\n\n18.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, Mr. Alonso furnished explanations in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). The Centre circulated Mr. Alonso's explanations to the Parties and to Mr. S\u00f6derlund on the same date.\n\n19.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, the Parties were invited to submit simultaneous observations on any of the documents filed regarding the proposals to disqualify Mr. Alonso and Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez by 19 September 2013. On 19 September 2013, the Respondent submitted its observations. On the same date, the Claimant submitted its observations in two separate documents: one document dealing with the resignation of Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez and another document relating to the proposed disqualification of Mr. Alonso.\n\n20.\n\nOn 4 October 2013, the Parties were invited to submit reply observations by 11 October 2013.\n\n21.\n\nFollowing an extension of the deadline granted by the Centre to both Parties, the Respondent submitted its reply observations on 24 October 2013. No additional comments were received from the Claimant.\n\n22.\n\nOn 12 November 2013, the proposal for disqualification of arbitrator Mr. Alonso was upheld by the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council. Given Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez prior resignation, the Claimant's proposal for his disqualification was dismissed by the Chairman of ICSID's Administrative Council. The Secretary-General notified the Parties of a vacancy on the Tribunal following the disqualification of Mr. Alonso and that the proceeding would remain suspended pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2).\n\n23.\n\nOn 13 November 2013, the Claimant appointed Prof. George A. Bermann as arbitrator, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(1). Prof. Bermann accepted his appointment on 21 November 2013.\n\n24.\n\nOn 27 November 2013, the Tribunal consented to the resignation of arbitrator Dr. Torres Bern\u00e1rdez pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 8(2), and the Centre notified the Parties thereof.\n\n25.\n\nOn 29 November 2013, the Respondent appointed Ms. Loretta Malintoppi (an Italian national) as arbitrator, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(1). Ms. Malintoppi accepted her appointment on 6 December 2013.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter of 9 December 2013, the Centre informed the Parties that the Tribunal had been reconstituted and that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 12, the proceeding was resumed.\n\n27.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held by teleconference on 27 January 2014. The following persons participated in the conference call:\n\nFor the Tribunal:  \nMr. Christer S\u00f6derlund (president)  \nProf. George Bermann (arbitrator)  \nMs. Loretta Malintoppi (arbitrator)\n\nFor the ICSID Secretariat:  \nMs. Alicia Mart\u00edn Blanco, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\nFor the Claimant:  \nMr. Pedro J.

In accordance with an extension granted by the Tribunal on 2 January 2016, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 14 January 2016.\n\n40.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's instructions, both Parties filed their documentary evidence for impeachment purposes on 3 February 2016. Neither party filed any documentary evidence for impeachment rebuttal purposes.\n\n41.\n\nOn 27 January 2016, both Parties identified the witnesses and experts they wished to examine during the hearing on jurisdiction. By email dated 29 January 2016, the Claimant objected to the examination at the hearing on jurisdiction of four of the witnesses requested by the Respondent. On 5 February 2016, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 6, in which it called upon the Claimant to produce two of the four witnesses requested by the Respondent.\n\n42.\n\nFrom 15 through 18 February 2016, the Tribunal and the Parties held a hearing on jurisdiction at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. The following persons attended the said hearing in whole or in part:\n\nFor the Tribunal:  \nMr. Christer S\u00f6derlund (president)  \nProf. George Bermann (arbitrator)  \nMs. Loretta Malintoppi (arbitrator)\n\nFor the ICSID Secretariat:  \nMs. Sara Marzal Yetano, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\nFor the Claimant:  \nMr. Pedro J.

BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimant, Blue Bank, engages in international banking business including, of particular importance in this case, the administration and management of trust assets. Its primary business concerns the provision of fiduciary services to third parties. In this latter respect, the Claimant establishes and administers trusts and discharges functions as trustee. Based on the Trust Deed (as most recently amended)4, the Claimant was appointed trustee of the Qatar Trust - a trust under the laws of Barbados - for the purpose of administering and managing the assets of that trust. Among those assets figure shareholdings in two BVI Companies which, in their turn, are indirect shareholders in two Venezuelan companies, ITC and Hemesa.\n\nThe Trust Deed,\" Exhibit C-99.\n\n47.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Venezuela has, by frustrating the business of the Venezuelan companies and destroying valuable rights belonging to those companies, breached the protections afforded by the BIT, causing significant harm to the investments made by it as trustee of the Qatar Trust. On this basis the Claimant brings this claim for compensation under the BIT.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent, which has not enunciated a position on the merits of the Claimant\u2019s prayers for relief, has contested ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence to adjudicate the complaints brought by the Claimant.\n\n49.\n\nAs notified to the Parties in the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2 of 13 January 2015, the Tribunal decided to deal with the matter of jurisdiction as a preliminary issue. As a consequence, the proceedings were bifurcated for this purpose and the proceedings on the merits suspended pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3).5\n\nParagraph 32 *supra*.\n\n**4. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND THEIR REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe following paragraphs set forth the Parties\u2019 positions with respect to the matter of the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal.\n\n**4.1 The Respondent\u2019s position and requests for relief**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal in the following terms:\n\n(a) The Respondent is not a party to the ICSID Convention and did not have that status at the time when this proceeding was filed. At the time, Venezuela had already voluntarily exercised its right to denounce the ICSID Convention and, thus, had withdrawn its consent to the submission of disputes to the jurisdiction of the Centre.6 In addition, the Respondent argues that, once its notice of denunciation of the Convention was given under Article 71 on 24 January 2012, its unilateral consent to submit to arbitration also lapsed pursuant to Article 72 of the Convention;7 Venezuela was not in any event a party to the Convention on the date of registration of the Request.8\n\n(b) The Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione personae* because Blue Bank is not the investor under the Treaty. It is the Qatar Trust, and not Blue Bank, that owns the investment. The Qatar Trust has no legal personality and cannot be regarded as a \"national of another Contracting State\" under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, nor as an \"investor\" according to the definition contained in Article 1(d) of the BIT.9\n\n(c) The real investors, if any, are Venezuelan nationals, and, as such, they are not protected under the Convention or the BIT.10\n\n(d) The Claimant underwent restructuring and established the Qatar Trust with the sole purpose of seeking protection under the ICSID Convention and the BIT after the dispute had arisen and thus the Claimant has engaged in conduct constituting an abuse of process.11\n\n(e) Even if the Tribunal were to find that the Claimant indirectly controls an investment in Venezuela, indirect investments do not enjoy protection under the Treaty.12\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 14.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 19 *& seq*.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 26-30.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 32-41; Respondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 196-198.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 58-86.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 87-89; Respondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 324-365\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 200-207.\n\n52.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent has requested that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) Declare that the Centre has no jurisdiction and that the Tribunal has no competence over the case brought by the Claimant, and that the claim put forward by the Claimant is inadmissible;\n\n(b) Alternatively, to reject each and every claim made by the Claimant; and\n\n(c) To order the Claimant to bear all costs relating to these proceedings, including any expense incurred by the Respondent in relation to its legal representation, plus interest.\n\n**4.2 The Claimant's position and requests for relief**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nOn the matters of the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal, the Claimant's position and requests for relief are the following.\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Venezuela's denunciation of the ICSID Convention does not affect its consent to this arbitration. Accordingly, the Claimant maintains that ICSID has jurisdiction over this case and that the Tribunal is competent to adjudicate it.13\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 23-38.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the four criteria required in order to have ICSID jurisdiction over a case according to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention are present, *i.e*.: (1) a nationality criterion involving a dispute between a Contracting State and a foreign national of another Contracting State; (2) a dispute having a legal character; (3) a dispute arising out of an investment; and (4) an agreement to arbitrate supported by the written consent of the parties.14\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 511.\n\n56.\n\nThe BIT contains similar jurisdictional requirements. The instant case meets all of the requirements necessary to establish ICSID's jurisdiction and the Tribunal's competence under both instruments.15\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant rejects all the jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent for reasons which will be dealt with in greater detail below.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) Declare that it has jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims and that such claims are admissible;\n\n(b) Direct the arbitration to proceed to a hearing on the merits of the Claimant's claims; and\n\n(c) Order Venezuela to bear the costs associated with the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration, including the Claimant's legal fees and expenses.16\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 136; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 101.\n\n**5. THE BURDEN OF PROOF IN THE JURISDICTIONAL PHASE**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**5.1 The Claimant's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted that in the jurisdictional phase it does not bear the burden of proving that the prerequisites for jurisdiction are met. It suffices, according to the Claimant, that the facts alleged by the Claimant as establishing jurisdiction be accepted *pro tem* so that the burden of proof of refuting jurisdiction lies with the Respondent.\n\n60.\n\nEssentially, the Claimant submits as follows:\n\n20. In the context of jurisdictional objections in an investor-State arbitration, then, the claimant is required to set forth a *prima facie* case of jurisdiction under the relevant treaty or treaties, including jurisdiction *ratione materiae, ratione personae, ratione temporis* and **ratione voluntatis**. Once the claimant has established this *prima facie* case, the burden shifts to the respondent to establish that that [*sic* ] there is not jurisdiction *ratione materiae, ratione personae, ratione temporis* or **ratione voluntatis**. If the respondent carries that burden, the objections may be granted. If the respondent fails to carry that burden, the objections are denied. If the tribunal is unable to make the determination on the evidence before it, the issue should be joined to the merits. [...]17\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 20.\n\n61.\n\nIn support of its position, the Claimant relies upon the separate opinion by Judge Higgins in the *Oil Platforms* Case,18 as well as a number of decisions on jurisdiction in investor-State arbitrations.19\n\n*Case Concerning Oil Platforms* (*Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America*), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, *I.C.J. Reports 1996,* p. 803, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34, Exhibits CLA-146, RLA-063.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14 and footnote 11.\n\n**5.2 The Respondent's position**\n---------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's position on the burden of proof. It takes the view that a person invoking the jurisdiction of an international tribunal must positively demonstrate that the requirements for establishing jurisdiction are met.20\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 5.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that, in accordance with the principle \"*actori incumbit probatio* \", and as confirmed by a number of international courts and tribunals, the person invoking the jurisdiction of an international court or tribunal must demonstrate that the requirements enabling such jurisdiction to be exercised are met. In other words, the Claimant must prove that all of the necessary jurisdictional prerequisites are satisfied.\n\n64.\n\nA lack of evidence necessarily leads to a lack of jurisdiction on the part of the Tribunal. In effect:\n\n[...] The burden of proof for the issue of consent falls squarely on a given claimant who invokes it against a given respondent. Where a claimant fails to prove consent with sufficient certainty, jurisdiction will be declined.21\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services Ltd (United Kingdom) v Argentina*, PCA Case No. 2010-9, 10 February 2012, \u00b6 280, cited at \u00b6 6 of the Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, Exhibit RLA-014.\n\n**5.3 The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, in order for the Tribunal to establish whether it has jurisdiction, it need consider whether the facts as alleged by the Claimant, if proven, could give rise to a Treaty breach. When setting forth this position, the Claimant has not distinguished between facts that have relevance specifically to the jurisdictional question only and facts that are also relevant for establishing the existence of claims that go to the substance of the dispute.22\n\n*See*, for instance, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 20, and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 16.\n\n66.\n\nHowever, in the Tribunal's view, it is necessary to distinguish between these different sets of facts with regard to the burden of proof. All facts that are dispositive for purposes of jurisdiction must be proven at the jurisdictional stage. In this regard, the Claimant bears the burden of proving the facts required to establish jurisdiction, insofar as they are contested by the Respondent. By contrast, facts that are relevant to the merits of the Claimant's claims, such as whether there has been a Treaty breach, whether liability has been incurred, whether the Claimant has suffered indemnifiable damages and, if so, what is the amount of liability (*quantum*), are all matters on which the Claimant does not need to discharge a burden of proof at the jurisdictional stage.\n\n67.\n\nAt the present jurisdictional stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal has before it only the Parties' submissions on jurisdiction and a limited evidentiary record, reflecting the arguments as to which the Parties sought to adduce factual support- insofar as they have considered that those factual matters relate to jurisdiction. In addition to the Claimant's statement of claim, which also includes a submission on the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal has been provided only with the Parties' views on the matters that in their respective opinion have a bearing on the matter of jurisdiction.\n\n68.\n\nA number of tribunals have echoed the oft-quoted approach of Judge Rosalyn Higgins' separate opinion in the *Oil Platforms* Case to the effect that the only way that a claim may be accepted as \"plausible\" on jurisdiction is for a tribunal \"to accept *pro tem* the facts as alleged by [a claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret [the treaty] for jurisdictional purposes - that is to say, to see if on the basis of [a claimant's] claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more of them.\"23\n\n*Oil Platforms* (*Iran v US*), Sep. Op. Higgins, paragraph 32.\n\n69.\n\nHowever, while it is true that matters that have a bearing on the merits of a dispute will not need to be conclusively established at the jurisdictional phase (something which may require a full-blown merits review of the case in its entirety), the matter of establishing a jurisdictional threshold is fundamentally different.\n\n70.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal shares the view of the *SGS v. Paraguay* tribunal which held as follows:\n\n52. [...] A determination that a given set of alleged facts, even if proven, would not constitute a violation of a legal right is, in effect, a holding on the merits [...].\n\n53. A fundamentally different approach is required, however, for issues that are directly determinative of the Tribunal's jurisdiction - such as, for example, issues of consent, nationality, covered investment, territoriality, or the temporal scope of treaty protection. If the Tribunal is to make jurisdictional determinations on such issues in a threshold jurisdictional stage (rather than joining them to the merits), the Tribunal must reach definitive findings of fact and conclusions of law. Without such determination, the Tribunal cannot satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction to hear the merits of the dispute.24\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9neral\u00e9 de Surveillance S.A. v Republic of Paraguay***,** ICSID Case No. ARB/07/29, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53, Decision on Jurisdiction, 12 February 2010, Exhibits RLA-027, CLA-074.\n\n71.\n\nThe matter of the burden of proof in the jurisdictional stage was also clearly explained in the Decision on Jurisdiction in the *Philip Morris v Uruguay* case in the following terms:\n\nRegarding burden of proof, it is commonly accepted that at the jurisdictional stage the facts as alleged by the claimant have to be accepted when, if proven, they would constitute a breach of the relevant treaty. However, if jurisdiction rests on the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as the existence of an \"investment\" and of the parties\u2019 consent, the Tribunal must apply the standard rule of onus of proof *actori incumbit probatio*, except that any party asserting a fact shall have to prove it.25\n\n*Philip Morris Brands S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 29, 2 July 2013, Exhibit CLA-148. See, also, the case law cited at footnotes 3 and 4 therein.\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal also concurs with the following statement by Sir Franklin Berman in the *Industria Nacional de Alimentos et al v. Peru* case:\n\n[I]f particular facts are a critical element in the establishment of jurisdiction itself, so that the decision to accept or to deny jurisdiction disposes of them once and for all for this purpose, how can it be seriously claimed that those facts should be assumed rather than proved?26\n\n*Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Peru S.A. v Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Decision on Annulment, 5 September 2007, Dissenting Opinion of Sir Franklin Berman, at \u00b6 17.\n\n73.\n\nIt follows that matters that are decisive for purposes of establishing jurisdiction, such as whether a particular claimant qualifies as an investor or whether an investment falls under the protection of the relevant treaty, must be proven and decided at the jurisdictional stage. In the present instance, the burden of proof that all the jurisdictional requirements of the case are met, insofar as they are contested by the Respondent, lies with the Claimant.\n\n**6. HAS THE RESPONDENT CONSENTED TO ARBITRATION (JURISDICTION** ***RATIONE VOLUNTATIS*****)?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**6.1 The Respondent's position**\n---------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent has objected to the jurisdiction of ICSID and to the competence of the Tribunal on the ground that the Request for Arbitration was submitted at a time when the Respondent had already denounced the ICSID Convention.27 According to the Respondent, even assuming that the Respondent\u2019s consent would have remained in effect six months after the date of denunciation under Article 71 of the Convention, that period of six months had elapsed by the time the Request was registered.28\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 14-25.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 26-31.\n\n75.\n\nOn these two points the Respondent has developed its position as follows.\n\n*6.1.1 Venezuela is not a party to the ICSID Convention*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nIn accordance with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, a State must be a Contracting State of that Convention in order for the Centre to have jurisdiction or for any tribunal established thereunder to have competence over a given dispute.29 By the time this proceeding was filed, Venezuela had already voluntarily exercised its right to denounce the ICSID Convention and, by so doing, had withdrawn its consent to submit disputes to the jurisdiction of the Centre.30\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 15; Respondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 60, 61.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 14.\n\n77.\n\nIn sum, Venezuela is not a party to the ICSID Convention, and did not have that status at the time when this proceeding was filed.\n\n78.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the absence of jurisdiction and competence became evident at two points in time: first, when the Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration to the Centre, as the Respondent had by that time already notified the depositary of its denunciation of the Convention; second, on the date when the Request was registered, since, even assuming that the six-month\u2019s notice requirement would apply during the period provided for in Article 71 of the Convention, that period had already elapsed, thus making the Respondent\u2019s consent moot. In view of those facts, the Respondent contends that there is no remaining basis for the jurisdiction of the Centre or the competence of the Tribunal.31\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 16.\n\n*6.1.2 Venezuela's consent to arbitration terminated upon its denunciation of the Convention*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nBy reference to Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, Venezuela further argues that, once a notice of denunciation is given under Article 71, consent can no longer be perfected through acceptance of an offer contained in a BIT or a law since the offer has become ineffective.32 Article 72 provides that:\n\nNotice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them before such notice was received by the depositary.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 21.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent relies on, *inter alia*, publications by Prof. Schreuer who has opined that, once a denunciation of the Convention has been notified, consent to submit a dispute to the Centre cannot be perfected.33 Prof. Schreuer explains that his position does not deprive the six-month period provided for in Article 71 of *effet utile*, because that period applies to other obligations incumbent upon a Contracting State under the Convention, such as respect for the Centre's immunities and privileges (Articles 18-24) and recognition and enforcement of awards (Article 54).34\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 20, 23.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 24.\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that Prof. Broches was unequivocal in stating that consent may not be perfected once the denunciation of the Convention has been notified,35 and cites an exchange to that effect that was made in the course of the drafting of the Convention, where Prof. Broches explained that:\n\n[i]f the State withdraws its unilateral statement by denouncing the Convention before it has been accepted by any investor, no investor could later bring a claim before the Centre.36\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 22; Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 64, 65.\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention, Vol. II, p. 1010, Exhibit RLA-085.\n\n82.\n\nThus, according to the Respondent, once a notice of denunciation of the Convention has been given under Article 71 - in this case, on 24 January 2012 -consent can no longer be perfected by way of acceptance by an investor of an offer to arbitrate contained in an investment treaty or a law, since such offer to arbitrate will have ceased to be effective and thus capable of acceptance. In other words, there is no longer an offer to submit disputes to an ICSID tribunal on the part of the denouncing State.\n\n*6.1.3 Venezuela was no longer a party to the ICSID Convention on the date the Request was registered*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nVenezuela denounced the Convention on 24 January 2012. Even assuming that the Claimant still enjoyed a six-month period within which to institute proceedings, that period ended on 24 July 2012.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant submitted its Request to ICSID on 25 June 2012. Although that submission took place within the six-month period following denunciation, the Request was not in fact registered until 7 August 2012. The delay was due to the fact that the request filed on 25 June 2012 did not meet the requirements for registration. As a result, the ICSID Secretariat asked the Claimant for documents and information, which were provided only on 27 July 2012, following which -on 7 August 2012 - the Request was finally registered. Thus, both the Claimant\u2019s submission of the additional information and the Secretariat\u2019s registration of the claim occurred after the six-month period had elapsed.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that, in order to establish the existence of international jurisdiction, the critical date for determining the fulfilment of jurisdictional requirements is the date of commencement of the proceedings and that proceedings cannot be considered as having been commenced until the Request is registered. It points to ICSID Institution Rule 6(2), which provides that \"[a] proceeding under the Convention shall be deemed to have been instituted on the date of the registration of the request.\"\n\n86.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this means that the critical date on which all jurisdictional requirements for a given dispute must be deemed to have been met is the date of registration which, in this case, was 7 August 2012, well after expiry of the six-month period.37 The Secretary-General may not register a request for arbitration where, on the date of registration, the State against which the proceeding is instituted is not a Contracting State to the Convention.38 Even if institution of the proceedings could be deemed to have occurred on 27 July 2012, which is when the Claimant met the necessary requirements in order for the request to be registered, that date is also more than six months later than the date of denunciation of the Convention by the Respondent.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 27.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 30.\n\n87.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal must decline its competence and deny the jurisdiction of the Centre over this dispute, since Venezuela did not give its consent to submit this dispute to the Tribunal. It was not a party to the Convention because its consent had expired on the date of denunciation. Even if Article 71 could be interpreted as giving the Claimant an additional six months following denunciation in which to institute proceedings, the Claimant failed to do so within that period.\n\n**6.2 The Claimant's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimant agrees with the Respondent that consent to arbitration by the Contracting State which is a party to the dispute is required. The Claimant disagrees, however, with Venezuela's contention that it did not consent to arbitrate this dispute.39 In the Claimant's view, Venezuela's assertion that it was no longer a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention following the notice of denunciation is irrelevant to whether Venezuela's offer of ICSID arbitration contained in the BIT remained in existence and capable of acceptance at the time of the Claimant's consent.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 23.\n\n89.\n\nSignificantly, Venezuela did not (and cannot) unilaterally withdraw its consent to arbitration under the BIT; what it did was to denounce the ICSID Convention. Pursuant to Article 71, that denunciation did not take effect for a period of six months. During that time period, the Claimant accepted Venezuela's offer to arbitrate, which was provided in the Treaty, not in the ICSID Convention. Even if the Claimant had not accepted Venezuela's offer within the six-month period, nothing in the Treaty or the Convention provides that the denunciation affects the Respondent's obligation to arbitrate according to the Treaty's terms. Article 72 affirmatively provides that Venezuela's denunciation does not affect its obligation arising out of consent given by Venezuela before the notice of denunciation.40\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 26.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimant consented to arbitrate its dispute with Venezuela upon submitting its Request on 22 June 2012. At that time, Venezuela's consent to arbitrate was still in effect. The Request was transmitted to Venezuela by email and international courier by the ICSID Secretariat on 6 July 2012. These dates predate 24 July 2012, which, under Article 71's six-month period, is the date when Venezuela's denunciation would have taken effect.41\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 25, 46. Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 55.\n\n*6.2.1 Venezuela's consent to ICSID arbitration in Article 8 of the Treaty remains in effect*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the fact that Venezuela expressly consented to arbitration under the auspices of ICSID in Article 8 of the Treaty, which provides as follows, in relevant part:\n\n(1) Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and national of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965.\n\n[...]\n\n(4) Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n92.\n\nThe Treaty, including Venezuela's unconditional consent to ICSID arbitration, entered into force on 31 October 1995 and remains in effect.\n\n93.\n\nVenezuela's notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention on 24 January 2012 does not nullify its consent to this arbitration. As noted above, Venezuela's consent to arbitrate is contained in the Treaty, which remains in force. Its denunciation of the Convention only affected its status as a Contracting State under the Convention, pursuant to the Convention's terms, not whether it has consented to ICSID arbitration.42\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 30.\n\n*6.2.2 Under Article 71 Venezuela remained a Contracting State at the time of the Claimant's filing*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nEven, were the Tribunal to find Venezuela's consent to ICSID arbitration in Article 8 of the Treaty insufficient to establish Venezuela's consent to this arbitration, the Claimant contends that Venezuela's consent to this arbitration follows from the application of Article 71 of the ICSID Convention. Article 71 provides that a Contracting State may denounce the Convention by providing written notice and that \"[t]he denunciation shall take effect six months after receipt of such notice.\" Under Article 71, Venezuela's denunciation of the Convention did not take effect until 25 July 2012, six months after notice of denunciation was provided on 24 January 2012.43\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 31.\n\n95.\n\nVenezuela remained a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention during this period because it is only \"[a]fter the denunciation becomes effective [that] a signatory will cease to be a Contracting State, which is one of the conditions required under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"44 Therefore, as Professor Gaillard has explained, \"[w]hen the investor has accepted the state's general consent. within the six-month period set forth in Article [71], the effectiveness of the existing rights and obligations should raise little difficulty as the host state is still a contracting party at th[at] time.\"45\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 32, citing J. Rodner and J.M. Estevez, *BITS in Pieces: The Effectiveness of ICSID Jurisdiction after the ICSID Convention Has Been Denounced*, J. OF INT'L ARB., Vol. 29, Issue 4, 437-51, Exhibit CLA-109.\n\nE. Gaillard, *The Denunciation of the ICSID Convention*, NYLJ, Vol. 237, No. 122 (26 June 2007), Exhibit CLA-096.\n\n*6.2.3 Article 72 of the ICSID Convention permits an investor to accept a host State's unilateral offer of ICSID arbitration after denunciation of the Convention*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nAlthough, in the Claimant's view, the application of Article 71, combined with the terms of the BIT, disposes of Venezuela's objection to jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* in this case, Claimant notes that Venezuela also relies on Article 72 to assert that mutual consent to arbitration by both parties is required to have been given before Venezuela's notice of denunciation was submitted to ICSID. However, this \"perfected consent\" theory ignores the plain language of the Convention.46\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 35.\n\n97.\n\nArticle 72 of the ICSID Convention covers the situation in which a denouncing State has unilaterally consented to ICSID jurisdiction prior to giving notice of its denunciation of the Convention.47\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 36.\n\n98.\n\nThe reference to \"consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one of them\" in Article 72 plainly refers to consent given by only one of the entities listed, namely a denouncing State, one of its constituent subdivisions or agencies, or one of its nationals - i.e. unilateral consent. The provision does not require consent given by more than one party and thus by its terms does not require mutual consent.48\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 36,\n\n99.\n\nAccordingly, pursuant to Article 72, a State\u2019s notice of withdrawal from the ICSID Convention does not affect its obligations under the Convention in a case in which it has given consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre before its notice of denunciation is received by ICSID. It is the unilateral consent of the State to ICSID jurisdiction - in this case by means of the BIT - that is relevant under Article 72.49\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 37,\n\n100.\n\nThus, the continued validity of Venezuela\u2019s consent to arbitration in this case is not dependent upon the application of Article 72. Nevertheless, Article 72 provides additional support for the proper assumption of jurisdiction by the Tribunal, as Venezuela\u2019s unilateral offer of ICSID arbitration in the Treaty - with a promise of continued validity for ten years after any denunciation of the Treaty - was made well before it denounced the Convention.50\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 32, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 59.\n\n**6.3 The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nIn order to establish whether it has jurisdiction **ratione voluntatis**, *i.e.* whether Venezuela\u2019s consent to jurisdiction was still valid and effective when the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration was filed, notwithstanding Venezuela\u2019s written notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis must both identify the appropriate normative framework and take account of the basic facts, more specifically, the chronology of this case. While the three members of the Tribunal have reached the same result regarding the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction **ratione voluntatis**, and agree on this conclusion unanimously, the President of the Tribunal has adopted a different approach to this issue and appends a separate opinion to this Award in this regard.\n\n*6.3.1 The normative framework*\n-------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nPursuant to Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal \"shall be the judge of its own competence\". This provision codifies the universally accepted principle of *kompetenz-kompetenz*, whereby, if a respondent challenges the jurisdiction of the Centre or the competence of a tribunal, the tribunal must be satisfied that the Centre has jurisdiction and the tribunal is competent to hear and decide a dispute.\n\n103.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre extends only to Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States of the Convention and its substantive scope of application is limited to \"investments\". These basic criteria are laid down in Article 25 of the Convention which, in relevant part, provides:\n\nArticle 25\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n104.\n\nPursuant to this provision, one of the requirements for ICSID jurisdiction is that both parties to a legal dispute consent in writing to submit that dispute to the Centre. Moreover, the last sentence of the first paragraph of Article 25 of the Convention expressly states that, once consent is given by the parties, it cannot be withdrawn unilaterally.\n\n105.\n\nA Contracting State can nevertheless denounce the Convention under Article 71, which provides as follows:\n\nArticle 71\n\nAny Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice to the depositary of this Convention. The denunciation shall take effect six months after receipt of such notice.\n\n*6.3.2 The chronology*\n----------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe relevant chronology of the present case is as follows: the Respondent filed a written notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention to the World Bank (as Convention depositary) on 24 January 2012. On 25 June 2012, the Claimant filed the Request for Arbitration dated 22 June 2012. ICSID forwarded a copy by courier and email under cover letter of 6 July 2012 to the Respondent, informing it that ICSID had received the Request on 25 June 2012.51 The Request was received by the Respondent on 7 July 2012.\n\nExhibit C-150.\n\n107.\n\nOn 18 July 2012, ICSID wrote to counsel on record for the Claimant requesting additional clarification of the Request.52 The Respondent\u2019s denunciation of the ICSID Convention became effective on 25 July 2012 pursuant to Article 71 of the Convention. On 27 July 2012, counsel of record for the Claimant replied to ICSID providing the clarifications sought.53 The Request was registered by the Centre on 7 August 2012.\n\nExhibit C-151.\n\nExhibit C-152.\n\n*6.3.3 The Tribunal's conclusion*\n---------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Parties devote attention in this regard to both Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention. The majority of the Tribunal considers that the starting point of the analysis is Article 71, the provision that contemplates denunciation and designates its date of effectiveness, rather than Article 72, whose purpose is to preserve from the consequences of denunciation the rights and obligations under the Convention arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by the denouncing State before the notice of denunciation is communicated to the depositary.54 If, as the majority finds, an agreement to arbitrate was formed between the Claimant and the Respondent before denunciation under Article 71 took effect, there is no reason to inquire further into Article 72, inasmuch as Article 72 deals only with the post-termination survival of certain of a State's rights or obligations.\n\nSchreuer *et al., op. cit*., p. 1280, \u00b6 5.\n\n109.\n\nThe majority finds, and the Parties so assumed in their pleadings, that the first inquiry in connection with the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* concerns whether, at the time the agreement to arbitrate was formed, Venezuela's denunciation of the ICSID Convention had, or had not, taken effect.\n\n110.\n\nThe existence of an agreement between the Parties to arbitrate the present dispute depends on whether the Respondent had made an offer to arbitrate such a dispute and whether the Claimant accepted that offer while the offer was still in effect.\n\n111.\n\nThe offer relied upon by the Claimant for purposes of this arbitration is contained in Article 8 of the BIT, dealing with the \"Settlement of disputes Between one Contracting Party and Nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party\" which states:\n\n(1) Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and national of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965.\n\n[...]\n\n(4) Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n112.\n\nAccording to its Article 13, the BIT was to remain in force for an initial period of ten years and thereafter continue in force until the expiration of twelve months after either Party\u2019s notice of termination. For investments made during the term of the BIT, a sunset period of ten years applies starting with the date of termination. The BIT had not been terminated at the time when the Claimant submitted its Request for Arbitration on 25 June 2012, and it remains in force today.\n\n113.\n\nIn order for the Claimant to accept the Respondent\u2019s offer to arbitrate, it must signify its consent to arbitrate. It is upon the Claimant\u2019s doing so that an agreement to arbitrate is formed between the Claimant and the Respondent. ICSID Institution Rule 2(3) specifically defines the \"date of consent\" as follows:\n\n\u2018Date of consent\u2019 means the date on which the parties to the dispute consented in writing to submit it to the Centre; if both parties did not act on the same day, it means the date on which the second party acted.\n\n114.\n\nICSID Institution Rule 2(3) thus suggests that the date when the Claimant\u2019s consent was given is the date on which the Claimant first filed its Request, *i.e.* \"the date on which the second party acted.\" This is the date when the investor\u2019s consent to the offer by the host State was expressed and the consent to arbitration was perfected.\n\n115.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, it is necessary to distinguish the date of institution of an arbitration from the \"date of consent\". The former event is governed by ICSID Institution Rule 6(2), according to which \"[a] proceeding [...] shall be deemed to have been instituted on the date of the registration of the request.\" As the tribunal in *Venoklim v. Venezuela* found, the date of registration depends only on the ICSID Secretariat and not on a claimant\u2019s procedural conduct, and a claimant should not be prejudiced in its filing of a request of arbitration for any delays that may accrue in connection with the registration. This is so, even in circumstances where the Secretariat requests additional information in order to register a request. The *Venoklim* tribunal remarked:\n\n[...] la fecha del registro de la Solicitud depende exclusivamente del Secretariado del CIADI y no de una actuaci\u00f3n jur\u00eddico-procesal de la Demandante. Ser\u00eda il\u00f3gico concluir que aunque la Demandante presentara su solicitud de arbitraje antes de que hubiera transcurrido el per\u00edodo de seis meses establecido en el Art\u00edculo 71, podr\u00eda resultar perjudicado por el transcurso del lapso indefinido que podr\u00eda existir entre la presentaci\u00f3n de la solicitud y el registro de esta.55\n\n\"[T]he date of registration of the Request depends solely on the ICSID Secretariat and not on a juridical-procedural action by the Claimant. It would be illogical to conclude that although the Claimant submitted its request for arbitration before the six-month period established in Article 71 has elapsed, it could be prejudiced by the lapse of an indefinite period that could exist between the filing of the request and the registration of the same.\" [Tribunal translation] *Venoklim Holding B.V. v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, Award, 3 April 2015, Exhibits CLA-157, RLA-084, \u00b6 78.\n\n116.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, at the time the Claimant originally filed the Request, it reasonably appeared that it had the authority to do so. When the ICSID Secretariat asked for further details as to the Claimant's internal corporate documents authorizing the filing, the Claimant filed a resolution of the Claimant's Board of Directors that authorized the granting of the power of attorney. It would make little sense to hold that the Claimant's consent did not take effect until such formalities were observed.\n\n117.\n\nAs for the date of effectiveness of a denunciation, Article 71 of the ICSID Convention, as noted, provides:\n\nAny Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice to the depositary of this Convention. The denunciation shall take effect six months after receipt of such notice.\n\n118.\n\nArticle 71 must be interpreted in conformity with the terms of Article 31 of the VCLT,56 in accordance with its ordinary meaning, in light of its object and purpose, and in order to ensure its *effet utile*. Under Article 32 of the VCLT, recourse to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of a treaty may be made in order to avoid a result which is \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable\".57\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331, 8 *I.L.M.* 679 (entered into force Jan. 27, 1980). It is undisputed that Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT reflect customary international law and thus apply in this case even though the ICSID Convention predates the VCLT and Venezuela is not a party to the VCLT.\n\n[...]\n\n119.\n\nOn a plain reading of Article 71, there exists a six-month period of time following receipt of a written notice of denunciation by the depositary before the denunciation becomes effective. The relevant language is mandatory: \"The denunciation *shall* take effect six months after receipt of such notice\" (emphasis added). It follows that a denunciation of the ICSID Convention takes effect only after the expiry of six months from the date of receipt of the notice of denunciation by the depositary. Any other interpretation of this provision would render the reference to a six-month time period devoid of any meaning, and would run directly contrary to the principle of *effet utile* (*ut res magis valeat quam pereat*), which is one of the fundamental tenets of treaty interpretation.58 If the intention was for the denunciation to take immediate effect, it would have made no sense to specify, in the second sentence of Article 71, that there should be a further waiting period of six months after receipt of the notice before the denunciation becomes effective.59\n\n*Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the District of Gex, Order of 19 August 1929, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 22*, p. 13; *Corfu Channel, Judgment of 9 April 1949, I.C.J.

Accordingly, the majority of the Tribunal finds that the question whether, under Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, consent given by the Respondent prior to denunciation remained valid even after the denunciation took effect and the Respondent was no longer a State party to the ICSID Convention, does not need to be addressed.60\n\n*See also* Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 26, where the Claimant acknowledges that \"the Tribunal need not decide the issue under Article 72\".\n\n**7. DOES THE TRIBUNAL HAVE JURISDICTION** ***RATIONE PERSONAE*** **UNDER THE TREATY?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**7.1 The Respondent's position**\n---------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that the Claimant qualifies as an investor under the Treaty.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent notes that Blue Bank claims to be \"the sole legal registered holder of the property and assets that constitute the Trust Fund of the Qatar Trust\".61 Nonetheless, available records indicate that the shares in the BVI Companies belong to the Qatar Trust and not to Blue Bank. For the Respondent, Blue Bank is the trustee of a trust created for the sole purpose of affording protection illegitimately to persons who would not otherwise be protected under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.62\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 37, referring to the Claimant\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 70 and the witness statement of Mr Ian StClair Hutchinson, \u00b6 24.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 33.\n\n123.\n\nThe BIT only deals with investments made by nationals or companies of a Contracting Party within the territory of the other Contracting Party. Article 1 of the Treaty states that investment means \"every kind of asset invested by nationals or companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party\". Thus, Article 1 of the Treaty provides that the assets making up the investment must be \"invested\" by the investor. This is not the case here because the assets invested by Blue Bank belong to the trust, not to the Claimant. In any event, given that the Qatar Trust does not have legal personality, is not a national of the other State and is not a company, it cannot be afforded protection under the BIT.63\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 38.\n\n124.\n\nBoth the ICSID Convention and the Treaty provide that a foreign investor may submit a dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre under certain circumstances. However, in the instant case, there is no foreign investor, given that a trustee is not the owner of the shares that are the subject-matter of the trust. Therefore, Blue Bank cannot be deemed to be the owner of the alleged investment to which this dispute refers. In the absence of this decisive element for the purpose of jurisdiction, this Tribunal has no competence over this case.64\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 41.\n\n125.\n\nMoreover, even if the description provided by Claimant of the corporate structure including GIM, Humboldt, Hemesa, and ITC were correct, the decisive issue is who really controls the Qatar Trust. That will determine whether the Centre may exercise its jurisdiction and the Tribunal its competence. For the Respondent, even if, *quod non*, the Tribunal were to conclude that Blue Bank is the investor because it is the trustee of the Qatar Trust, the Tribunal would still lack jurisdiction over this dispute because Venezuelan nationals or a Qatari sovereign fund appear to be hiding behind the Qatar Trust and in any case dominating the Claimant.65\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 48.\n\n**7.2 The Claimant's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nBlue Bank contends that it is a protected investor under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.66\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 48, *in fine*.\n\n127.\n\nBlue Bank meets the requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention in respect of disputes submitted to arbitration between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State.67 As a \"juridical person\", Blue Bank also satisfies the nationality requirement provided in Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.68\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 512.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 513.\n\n128.\n\nBlue Bank, not the Qatar Trust, is the claimant in this arbitration and it is Blue Bank's status as an investor under the Treaty and the Convention that is determinative for the claimant's *jus standi*.\n\n129.\n\nBlue Bank is a \"company\" under Article 1 of the Treaty. Article 1(d) additionally provides that \"\u2018companies' means, in respect of each Contracting Party, \u2018corporations', firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in that Contracting Party [...]\" In the Barbados-Venezuela BIT there is no restriction on the nationality of a protected investor's shareholders for the purposes of determining that company's nationality. As tribunals have recognised, such an omission indicates that the parties intended *not* to impose additional restrictions on a company's nationality.69\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 156-157.\n\n130.\n\nBlue Bank is incorporated under the laws of Barbados and was a national of Barbados on all dates relevant to this dispute, including the dates on which the Treaty breaches occurred and the date on which Blue Bank consented to arbitration. Blue Bank is physically located in Barbados, and Barbados is its sole place of business.70\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 60.\n\n131.\n\nConsequently, Blue Bank is a \"National of another Contracting State\" under the first clause of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which defines a \"National of another Contracting State\" as \"any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit the dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\" Blue Bank fits within this definition because, as noted above, it was a company incorporated under the laws of Barbados on the date that the Request for Arbitration was filed (and indeed remains so).71\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 58; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 63.\n\n132.\n\nThere is no basis under the Treaty or the Convention to look to anything other than Blue Bank\u2019s place of incorporation to determine its nationality as an investor. It is not, therefore, possible to impugn Blue Bank\u2019s status as the legal owner of the trust property, including the investments at issue in this case. The Treaty does not require that an investor hold a beneficial interest in the investment. Investor-State tribunals have recognised that ownership of the investment is not limited to beneficial ownership, and they have accepted that claims may be brought by the trustees on behalf of a trust.72\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 55; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 65.\n\n133.\n\nAny attempt to suggest that Blue Bank is not the owner of the investment is unavailing. It does not matter if the Escrow Agreement and the Pledge Agreement or the share purchase agreements list the Qatar Trust as the owner of the investment or the purchaser of the shares in GIM Tour and Western Hemisphere in view of the fact that the Trust Deed and Barbados law establish Blue Bank, as trustee, as the legal owner of the trust property.73\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 66.\n\n**7.3 The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nA few fundamental facts and documents relating to the Qatar Trust and to Blue Bank need to be recalled at the outset to place the discussion in the proper context.\n\n135.\n\nBlue Bank brings the action as trustee for the Qatar Trust. It does not invoke an investment made for its own account or on its own behalf, the alleged investment being the acquisition of the two BVI Companies. This is stated, for instance, in the Request for Arbitration, under \"I. Introduction\", as follows:\n\nBlue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. (\"Blue Bank\"), a Barbados corporation, as trustee of the Qatar International Authorised Purpose Trust (\"Qatar Trust\"), submits to arbitration at the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") certain claims against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"Venezuela\").74\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 1.\n\n136.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant explains its role in the following terms:\n\nBlue Bank serves as Trustee of the Purpose Trust titled Qatar International Authorised Purpose Trust (\"the Qatar Trust\"). On June 8, 2006, the Qatar Trust was established as an international trust under the *International Trusts Act* of the Laws of Barbados.75\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 69.\n\n137.\n\nFurther, the Claimant states that the Qatar Trust is the \"substantial investor\"76 and describes its role in submitting the claim in this arbitration in the following terms:\n\nBlue Bank brings this action as Trustee for the Qatar Trust because as a matter of law, this purpose trust under the laws of Barbados has no beneficiary and no other natural person or juridical entity as a matter of law who can bring this claim arising from damage to the Qatar Trust assets.77\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 1.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 79.\n\n138.\n\nThis fundamental premise, *i.e*. that Blue Bank brings this claim as trustee of the Qatar Trust, is undisputed between the Parties, and has, consequently, formed the point of departure for their respective positions in this arbitration.\n\n*Formation and Modification of the Qatar Trust*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe documents and facts regarding the formation and amendments affecting the Qatar Trust which are constitutive of the Claimant's trusteeship are outlined below.\n\n*The Original Trust Deed of 21 April 2005*\n------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nAccording to the Original Trust Deed of 21 April 2005,78 the Settlor, *i.e.* an individual identified as \"Jaime Castillo of Caracas, Venezuela\", has settled property on the trust \"set out in Schedule A\" in an amount of USD 5,000.\n\nExhibit R-116.\n\n141.\n\nThe Qatar Trust was set up in Bahamas. The trustee at the time was Ansbacher, a provider of trust services in Bahamas under the Banks and Trust Companies Act.\n\n142.\n\nThe \"Authorized Purposes of the Trust,\" according to Article 3(1) of the Original Trust Deed, was \"to acquire and procure certain shareholdings and act as shareholders in various Venezuelan enterprises.\"79\n\nThe paperwork that brought about this situation is indicated by the Claimant in a footnote in the Claimant's Memorial of the following tenor: \"42 See Exhibit C-100, a true and correct copy of the Share Purchase Agreement executed on April 27, 2005, and pursuant to which Blue Bank (Qatar Trustee) agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of: (i) GIM TOUR LTD and (ii) WESTERN HEMISPHERE HOTEL LTD\".\n\n*The Second Trust Deed of 1 July 2005*\n--------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nIn the Second Trust Deed,80 the purpose of the Trust is described in Article 3(1) somewhat more generically as the acquisition of \"certain negotiable instruments, shareholdings and act as the shareholder in various enterprises\". As in the Original Trust Deed, the shares were to be pledged for purposes of satisfying \"obligations under [t]he Agreements\" (sub-littera c) (despite capitalization, not a defined term). To the Second Trust Deed was appended a \"Schedule A,\" listing the amount of \"US$ 5,000\".\n\nExhibit R-161, pp 18-36, which includes a compilation of the existing trust deeds in the case.\n\n*The Third Trust Deed of 15 March 2006*\n---------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Third Trust Deed81 concerns the appointment of the Claimant as the new trustee in replacement of Ansbacher under its previous company name, Oceanic Bank and Trust (Barbados) Limited.\n\nExhibit R-114.\n\n*The Fourth Trust Deed of 16 March 2006*\n----------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nIn the preambular language (Article 4) of the Fourth Trust Deed,82 it is provided that the governing law be changed to that of Barbados, that the Original Trust Deed be made consistent with the International Trusts Act of Barbados as well as generally \"vary the terms of the Trust for the better protection of the purposes therein stated\".\n\nExhibit R-115.\n\n*The Trust Deed of 8 June 2006*\n-------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Trust Deed,83 described by the Claimant as the current version at the time of the arbitral proceedings, is in essential respects a restatement of its prior versions.\n\nExhibit C-99.\n\n147.\n\nIt is also important to recall the facts regarding the purchase by the Qatar Trust of the BVI companies\n\n*The Purchase of the BVI Companies*\n-----------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nA few days after the formation of the Qatar Trust, on 27 April 2005, the BVI Companies were purchased by the Qatar Trust for an aggregate amount of USD 156 million (of which USD 60 million was contingent on a certain future event). Through the BVI companies, the Qatar Trust had ownership interests in the Venezuelan companies ITC and Hemesa, which are said by the Claimant to be part of the investment it made in this case.84 It was agreed that payment of the entire purchase sum was to be on deferred terms.85\n\nTo be clear, the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 92, states as follows: \"Blue Bank's investment includes its ownership interests in Venezuelan companies ITC and Hemesa, which were purchased for US$156,000,000; its interest in the sums\u2014totalling over US$100,000,000\u2014that ITC and Hemesa invested in the Telef\u00e9rico, Hotel Humboldt and Hotel Puerto La Cruz; and its interests in the Concession Contracts.\" Those may constitute investments of ITC and Hemesa, but not of any foreign investor, let alone Blue Bank.\n\nExhibit C-100.\n\n149.\n\nThe funds required to meet these payment obligations appear to have been borrowed - or intended to be borrowed at a future date - from Brighton, which, according to the Escrow Agreement86 and a Collateral Pledge Agreement87 of 1 April 2005 between Brighton and the Qatar Trust, was to be given the shares of the BVI Companies as collateral.\n\nExhibit R-112.\n\nExhibit R-113.\n\n150.\n\nBy the Escrow Agreement, Brighton undertook to deposit into an escrow an amount of USD 250 million in favor of the Qatar Trust in return for the pledge of the shares in the BVI Companies.\n\n151.\n\nAll of these transactions took place before the Claimant was appointed trustee of the Qatar Trust and were performed by the trustee at the time, Ansbacher, Bahamas88. Thus, Ansbacher had the Qatar Trust purchase the BVI Companies pursuant to the two share purchase agreements dated 27 April 2005.89\n\nThe Tribunal attaches no significance to the fact that it was Blue Bank's predecessor, Ansbacher, that acted on behalf of the Qatar Trust when making the investment.\n\nThe paperwork that brought about this situation is indicated by the Claimant in a footnote in the Claimant's Memorial of the following tenor: \"42 See Exhibit C-100, a true and correct copy of the Share Purchase Agreement executed on April 27, 2005, and pursuant to which Blue Bank (Qatar Trustee) agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of: (i) GIM TOUR LTD and (ii) WESTERN HEMISPHERE HOTEL LTD.\"\n\n152.\n\nWith this background in mind, the Tribunal will now move to consider whether it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* under the ICSID Convention and under the BIT.\n\n153.\n\nThe ICSID Convention does not contain a definition of \"investor.\" Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\" This provision defines the outer demarcation lines for subjective and substantive access to ICSID arbitration. The Claimant in this case is a \"national of another Contracting State.\" This is in principle sufficient from the point of view of nationality under the ICSID Convention.\n\n154.\n\nNevertheless, when it comes to the specific delimitation of competence conferred upon an arbitral tribunal in any given instance, recourse must additionally be had to the instrument on which jurisdiction is ultimately based, in this case an investment protection treaty.\n\n155.\n\nArticle 8(1) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\nDisputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, *at the request of the national concerned*, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965. (Emphasis added).\n\n156.\n\nThere is no definition of \"investor\" in the underlying BIT in this case either. Instead, the term \"companies\" is defined as follows under Article 1(d) of the BIT:\n\n\"companies\" means, in respect of each Contracting Party, corporations, firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in that Contracting Party;\n\n157.\n\nPursuant to the above provisions of the BIT, and given that Blue Bank is a company incorporated under the laws of Barbados, *i.e.* of one of the Contracting States to the BIT, the nationality requirement under the BIT is satisfied. However, the BIT defines the ambit of persons and investments protected under the treaty in the following terms (Article 1(a)):\n\nARTICLE I  \nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, \"investment\" means every kind of asset invested by nationals or companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party and in particular, though not exclusively, includes: [nonexhaustive list of asset classes]\n\n158.\n\nIn light of the relevant provisions of the BIT, including Articles 8(1) and 1(a), the central question to be determined for purposes of jurisdiction is whether the Claimant, found to have the requisite nationality, has made an \"investment\" pursuant to Article 1(a).\n\n**8. HAS BLUE BANK MADE AN \"INVESTMENT\" PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 1(A) OF THE TREATY?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Tribunal has competence because Blue Bank, as trustee of the Qatar Trust, is the legal owner of the assets of the Qatar Trust. The Tribunal will therefore address this question first.\n\n**8.1 Does Blue Bank as trustee have legal ownership of the assets of the Qatar Trust?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nBy way of introduction, it is worth noting that, in the case of the Qatar Trust, the sole asset that has been settled on the trust consists of the USD 5,000 allegedly contributed by the \"Original Settlor,\" a Venezuelan national by the name of James Castillo Ledesma.\n\n161.\n\nThe fundamental feature of a trusteeship under the Barbados International Trusts Act is that the trustee may not have any interest in the fortunes of the entrusted assets. The trustee does not manage the trust assets on its own behalf and does not have an interest of any nature whatsoever in those assets. The trust assets are separate from the equity of the trustee and do not form part of the trustee\u2019s estate.\n\n162.\n\nThe characteristics of a trust and the nature of a trusteeship under Barbados law are set forth in the following terms in the Barbados International Trusts Act:\n\n(1) In this Act, the expression \"trust\" means the legal relationship created when assets have been placed under the control of a trustee for the benefit of a beneficiary or for a specific purpose.\n\n(2) A trust has the following characteristics\n\n(a) the assets of the trust constitute a separate fund and are not a part of the trustee\u2019s own estate;\n\n(b) title to the assets of the trust is held in the name of the trustee or in the name of another person on behalf of the trustee;\n\n(c) the trustee has the power and the duty to manage, employ or dispose of the assets of the trust in accordance with the terms thereof and the special duties imposed upon him by law; and\n\n(d) the trustee is accountable for the management and administration of the assets of the trust.90\n\nExhibit CLA-129.\n\n163.\n\nApplying these provisions to the case at hand, in relation to the trust assets, Blue Bank exercises the function of a trustee - a *sui generis* legal construct - and as such it acts in its own name but on behalf of the trust in furtherance of certain third party interests (whether for a person or a purpose). As trustee, Blue Bank does not own the assets, but simply manages and administers them for a particular purpose (in the case of a so-called \"purpose trust\") or to the benefit of a third party (in the case of a customary beneficiary trust). It follows that, by acting in its capacity as trustee, the Claimant cannot be considered as having committed any assets in its own right, as having incurred any risk, or as sharing the loss or profit resulting from the investment. As appears from the Trust Deed, the emolument flowing to the Claimant for its discharge of services as the Trustee of the Qatar Trust is an annual fixed fee and nothing else:\n\nThe Trustee shall be entitled to be paid out of the Trust Fund, an annual fee of One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$100,000.00), (the \"Annual Trustee Fee\") in respect of the Trustee acting in the capacity as Trustee of this Trust, and for all services provided hereunder.91\n\nArticle 17.1 of the Trust Deed, Exhibit C-99.\n\n164.\n\nThe plain and ordinary meaning of Article 8(1) of the BIT makes it clear that the Tribunal's *ratione personae* jurisdiction is predicated on the Claimant having made an \"investment.\" An \"investment\" is defined in Article 1(a) of the BIT as \"every kind of asset invested by [...] companies of one Contracting Party.\" Determinative for Blue Bank's standing is therefore the question whether it has made an investment.\n\n165.\n\nBlue Bank brings a claim in its capacity of trustee on behalf of the Qatar Trust and not on its own behalf, does not own the alleged investment and is not bringing a claim in relation to an investment that it has made itself. As for the Qatar Trust, it lacks personality (as acknowledged by both Parties) and it is not a company. Moreover, the ordinary meaning of the words \"nationals\" or \"companies\" provided in the BIT does not extend to a \"trust\", whether this absence exists by chance or by design.\n\n166.\n\nBy way of example, in the *Renta et al. v. Russia* case,92 two of the claimants were pension funds without legal personality, the assets of which were managed by management companies. These funds display, in relevant respects, great similarities with a trust. The *Renta* tribunal in particular held as follows:\n\n122. Russia argues that Emergentes and Eurofondo are not corporate bodies. Spanish law (specifically: Article 3 of Law 35/2003 of 4 November 2003) treats them as collective investment funds without legal personality. It follows in Russia\u2019s submission that they are not investors as defined in the Spanish BIT.\n\n[...]\n\n127. [...] It requires a juridical leap to allow the funds to qualify as investors by absorbing a corporate identity which is not their own.\n\n*Renta 4 S.V.S.A et al. v Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. Arbitration V *(024/2007)*, Award on Preliminary Objections, dated 20 March 2009.\n\n167.\n\nMoreover, under the Trust Deed, the trustee\u2019s powers over the trust assets are extremely limited, as can be clearly seen from clauses 9.1.2, 9.2.1, 9.3, 18 and 20. At bottom, the trustee (Blue Bank) simply performs a service to third party interests - ultimately the beneficiary or the purpose of the Qatar Trust, as the case may be - in exchange for a fee.93\n\nAs observed at \u00b6 199 below, the President of the Tribunal does not attach importance on the matter of limited control.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties\u2019 arguments have occasionally centered around such concepts as \"legal owner,\" \"beneficial or nominal ownership,\" \"legal title,\" \"nominee ownership\" and the like.94 However, this is a mere matter of semantics. In actual fact and law, Blue Bank is not an owner in any relevant sense of the word.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 1: \"Blue Bank as Trustee is the absolute legal owner of the trust fund\"; Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 49: \"Blue Bank is the legal owner of the assets that comprise the trust fund\"; *Ibid*., \u00b6 51: \". the trustee is the legal owner of the trust fund under applicable Barbadian law\"; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 49: \". the placing of property into trust results in the legal ownership of that property being transferred to the trustee\".\n\n169.\n\nIt follows that the Claimant\u2019s repeated references to Blue Bank as the \"legal owner\" of the trust assets is inapposite. It may be noted that the Barbados International Trusts Act is carefully drafted so as not to describe the legal relationship created between the trustee and the trust assets in terms of \"ownership,\" \"legal title\" or the like. Instead, the Act takes care to refer to the trust assets as a \"separate fund,\" not part of the trustee\u2019s \"own estate\" and provides that title to the trust assets is held \"in the name of the trustee,\" not that the assets are \"owned\" by the trustee.\n\n170.\n\nThe party that would come closest to satisfying the requirements of \"ownership\" with regard to the assets of the Qatar Trust is what the trust deeds refer to as the \"Eligible Person\" (which is not a term of art but one that the Tribunal - for reasons given in paragraphs 190 to 194 below - considers to be a beneficiary). It is the \"Eligible Person\", in this case Hampton, that enjoys ultimate control over the trust assets and that will ultimately enjoy or suffer, as the case may be, the fortunes of the trust assets.\n\n171.\n\nUnder Schedule I of the Trust Deed, Hampton is also the \"Protector\", jointly with another company, Waterstone. Section 16 of the Trust Deed lists the powers and duties of the Protector, who is \"responsible for ensuring that the terms of [the] Trust Deed are complied with and are given effect to\" and has, *inter alia*, the power to remove the trustee.95 For its part, the trustee has no power and no discretion over the trust assets. As noted by the Respondent's expert, David Brownbill QC:\n\n[Under the terms of the trust] [t]he trust property belongs, in equity, exclusively to Hampton. This situation can change only if Hampton itself effects that change in its capacity as Protector. The trustee has no material power or discretion which could be exercised so as to diminish or prejudice Hampton's position. [...] As the entire beneficial interest vests, indefeasibly, in a single beneficiary the Trustee is a nominee or bare trustee for Hampton.96\n\nClauses 16.1.1 and 16.2.1 respectively.\n\nDavid Brownbill QC Expert Report, \u00b6 28.\n\n172.\n\nIn conclusion, Blue Bank, as a trustee holding the assets of the Qatar Trust for the ultimate benefit of third party interests, does not own the assets of the Qatar Trust, did not invest these assets for its own account and cannot, therefore, ground jurisdiction on any investment made by it as required by Articles 1(a) and 8(1) of the BIT.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal has thus reached the conclusion that Blue Bank has no ownership rights in respect of the assets of the Qatar Trust, that it has not brought a claim on its own behalf - whether as a nominal or beneficial owner - and that, accordingly, Blue Bank has not invested the relevant assets under the terms of the BIT.\n\n**8.2 The legal nature of the Qatar Trust**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nAlthough for purposes of determining whether the Claimant has made an \"investment\" in Venezuela, as required under Article 1(a) of the BIT, it is not necessary to determine the nature of the Qatar Trust, given the significance attached by the Parties to this question for purposes of jurisdiction, the Tribunal addresses the question here.\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimant contends in this regard that - as trustee of the Qatar Trust - it is the legal owner of its assets. It specifically characterizes the Qatar Trust as a \"purpose trust.\" The Claimant further asserts that - as legal owner of the property of the Qatar Trust and the only entity that may advance claims with regard to that property - it is the proper claimant in this case.97 For its part, the Respondent argues that the Qatar Trust is a conventional beneficiary trust which does not belong to the trustee (whose capacity is very limited) but to the Eligible Person.98\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 510.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 103-113.\n\n176.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 arguments may be summarized as follows:\n\n*8.2.1 The Respondent's position*\n---------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent contests the assertion that the Claimant\u2019s actions as trustee for the Qatar Trust confer investor status on the Claimant. For the Respondent, the Qatar Trust is not a purpose trust. The International Trusts Act 1995 of Barbados, which would apply to the Qatar Trust, includes in Part III the definition of \"purpose trusts\":\n\nIn this Part, \"purpose trust\" means\n\n(a) a trust, other than a trust that is for the benefit of particular persons, whether or not immediately ascertainable, or\n\n(b) a trust that is [not] for the benefit of some aggregate of persons ascertained by reference to some personal relationship99\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6 95; Exhibit R-13. The Respondent argues that this provision of the Trusts Act should be read to include the word \"not\" between \"is\" and \"for\" in letter (b). See, for instance, Transcript, Day 3, page 532, line 3.\n\n178.\n\nIn order to determine whether a trust is a *purpose trust* or a customary, *beneficiary trust*, its object has to be analyzed in order to establish whether it has been created for the benefit of a particular person or an aggregate of persons. When no person or aggregate of persons can be identified as the beneficiary, this is constitutive of a *purpose trust.*\n\n179.\n\nThe Qatar Trust was created for the benefit of a person, Hampton, which is both the Eligible person and Protector of the Qatar Trust. The very purpose of the Qatar Trust is to provide benefits to Hampton, independently of the obligation of the Qatar Trust to repay the loans obtained in exchange for the issue of Qatar Notes.\n\n180.\n\nIn addition to distributing earnings to the Eligible Person, the only other purpose of the assets described in the trust deeds is the satisfaction of merely administrative needs. Therefore, the Qatar Trust is not a *purpose trust,* but an ordinary trust created for the benefit of a particular person. No part of the assets or income is distributed or allocated to a specific purpose other than acquiring companies in order to repay the loans obtained and distribute the remainder to Hampton. All operating companies of the Qatar Trust are Venezuelan.\n\n181.\n\nIn this respect, the Original Trust Deed explains that the purpose of the trust was the following:\n\n[...] acquire or procure certain shareholdings and act as the shareholder in various Venezuelan enterprises (hereinafter the \"Enterprises\") in order to irrevocably pledge such assets and income from such assets to Brighton Preferred Equity Investments Ltd. (hereinafter \"Brighton\") in form of a Promissory Note (the \"Note\") in order raise sufficient funds [...]100\n\nExhibit R-116.\n\n*8.2.2 The Claimant's position*\n-------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimant explains its role as trustee of the Qatar Trust in the statement of claim as follows:\n\nBlue Bank serves as Trustee of the Purpose Trust titled Qatar International Authorised Purpose Trust (\"the QatarTrust\"). On June 8, 2006, the Qatar Trust was established as an international trust under the International Trusts Act of the Law of Barbados.101\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 69.\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimant describes the Qatar Trust as follows.\n\n[a]s a purpose trust, the Qatar Trust is a special genus of trust that under the laws of Barbados is a statutory product of the International Trusts Act. As a principle of law, a person who derives a direct or consequential benefit (whether' financial or non-financial), through the proper exercise by the Trustee of the stated purpose of the trusts has no beneficial interest in the trust property or trust fund. Such an individual has no property or proprietary interest in the trust in the technical sense that, for example, would allow the person to take legal action on the trust\u2019s behalf. [Emphasis omitted].102\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 71.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimant has made the following remarks with respect to its role as investor under the BIT.\n\nThe non-charitable purpose trust is a statutory creation in Barbados, a product of the International Trusts Act. The Qatar Trust satisfies the essential requirements for validity of an international purpose trust under section 10 of the Act.103\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 32.\n\n185.\n\nThe Qatar Trust satisfies the four requirements for a purpose trust under the Barbados International Trusts Act:\n\nThe stated purposes are properly construed specific, reasonable and capable of fulfillment, and are not immoral, unlawful or contrary to public policy. There is a First Protector to enforce the Trust and provision for the appointment of a successor-protector. The Qatar Trust specifies the event upon the happening of which the Qatar Trust terminates (defined as the \"Termination Date\") and provides for the disposition of surplus assets of the Qatar Trust upon its termination [...]104\n\nQuoted from the Claimant\u2019s expert\u2019s written statement, Second Witness Statement of Peter David Hutson Williams, \u00b6 27.\n\n186.\n\nThe distributive elements of the Qatar Trust for the benefit of the Eligible Persons are intended to give effect to the stated purposes and do not create a separate beneficial interest in the Eligible Persons. Rather, the residual distributive element of the Qatar Trust, stated in Section 7.1(k), is required for a purpose trust under section 10(d) of the International Trusts Act and is in the nature of a contingent contractual obligation owed by the trustee to the Eligible Persons. It does not reflect the creation of a trust for the benefit of Eligible Persons or any one Eligible Person.\n\n187.\n\nThe creation of the Qatar Trust was for purposes of facilitating access to capital by enabling the securitization of the Trust\u2019s assets.\n\n188.\n\nBlue Bank became trustee and reorganized the Qatar Trust under Barbados Law for commercial reasons. The Qatar Trust was restructured under Barbados law in 2006 primarily to get the benefit of a bilateral tax treaty between Barbados and Venezuela that provided benefits that were unavailable in the Bahamas in respect of any income from the trust property.\n\n189.\n\nBlue Bank is the legal owner of the property of the Qatar Trust and the only entity that may claim in respect of the trust property. It is a basic legal principle in common-law jurisdictions that the placing of property into trust results in the legal ownership of that property being transferred to the trustee. All legal interest in the trust assets is held by the trustee.\n\n*8.2.3 The Tribunal's conclusion*\n---------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nAlthough, as noted (paragraph 179 *supra*), the characterization of the Qatar Trust as a beneficiary or a purpose trust is not dispositive of this case, the Tribunal, in consideration of the attention paid to the matter by counsel, has considered the matter and concludes that the Qatar Trust is not a purpose trust.\n\n191.\n\nThe International Trusts Act 1995 of Barbados, which would apply to the Qatar Trust, includes in Part III, Section 9, the following definition of \"purpose trusts\":\n\n9. In this Part, \"purpose trust\" means\n\n(a) a trust, other than a trust that is for the benefit of particular persons, whether or not immediately ascertainable, or\n\n(b) a trust that is [not] for the benefit of some aggregate of persons ascertained by reference to some personal relationship.105\n\nAs noted above, the negation within hard brackets is added by reason of Mr Brownbill's remark that its omission is a drafting mistake (Transcript, Day 3, page 532, lines 2 and 3). The Tribunal finds this remark logically compelling, although this is ultimately of no consequence for the Tribunal's conclusion.\n\n192.\n\nIn order to determine whether a trust is a purpose trust or a beneficiary trust, its object has to be analyzed. When no particular person or aggregate of persons can be identified as the beneficiary, the trust may be characterized as a purpose trust. The concept of purpose trust must, consequently, be negatively defined.\n\n193.\n\nAs discussed at paragraphs 179 - 180 above, the Qatar Trust was created for the benefit of a person, *i.e*. Hampton, which is both the Eligible Person and the Protector of the Qatar Trust. The very purpose of the Qatar Trust is to provide benefits to Hampton, independent of the obligation of the Qatar Trust to repay the loans obtained in exchange for the issue of Qatar Notes which of course is not a beneficial but an onerous obligation.\n\n194.\n\nThe only other purpose of the assets described in the Qatar Trust Deed is the satisfaction of merely administrative needs. Therefore, the Qatar Trust is not a purpose trust, but a customary beneficiary trust created for the benefit of a particular person.\n\n**8.3 Did Blue Bank act with the independence associated with a beneficiary trust?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nAlthough the preceding discussion establishes that the Claimant cannot assert jurisdiction in the absence of an investment of assets that it has made, the analysis would not be complete (according to the majority) if consideration were not at all given to the terms of the Trust Deed according to which Blue Bank was to perform its functions as trustee. This question is addressed below.\n\n196.\n\nAlthough a trustee in a beneficiary trust must without doubt act for the benefit of the beneficiary, a trustee must be in a position to act with some independence in pursuing that purpose. An examination of the Trust terms reveals that in performance of its tasks, Blue Bank cannot perform many essential trustee functions independently, but, with respect to them, is under the control of Hampton, as both the Eligible Person and the Protector of the Qatar Trust. It is true that the Trust Deed purports generally, in Clauses 9 and 10.1-10.3, to guarantee the Trustee's independence, but it also conditions a great many meaningful exercises of authority by Blue Bank to the consent of the Hampton as both Protector and \"Eligible Person.\" Illustrative are the following:\n\n* Clause 8.1: \"The Trustee shall not be held liable for any breach of duty or loss or damage to any third party caused by virtue of or as a result of any distribution made pursuant to the direction of the Protector. The Trustee shall not have the responsibility or any duty to investigate or ascertain whether any discretion directed to be made by the Protector is properly in furtherance of the purposes hereof.\"\n* Clause 8.2: \"The Trustee [...] may pay or apply the whole or any part or parts of the capital or income of the Trust Fund to or for the benefit of the Eligible Persons, in such manner as the Protector shall in its direction think fit.\"\n* Clause 8.3: \"With the consent of the Protector, the Trustee may pay or transfer the whole or any part of the capital or income of the Trust Fund to the trustees for the time being of any other trust wheresoever established or existing [...]\"\n* Clause 8.4: \"[...] [A]ny settlement made by the Trustee under this present power upon or for the benefit of the Eligible Persons [...] may contain such trusts, powers and provisions whatsoever [...] as the Protector in its absolute discretion shall determine.\"\n* Clause 9.4.2: \"The Trustee shall not without the consent of the Protector [...] take or execute any of the following actions [among which] (d) the sale, exchange, assignment, pledge or hypothetication of any Enterprise or all or substantially all of the assets forming part of the Trust Fund.\"\n* Clause 13.1: \"The Protector, shall have power at any time or times during the Trust Period to add to the class of Eligible Persons such one or more persons [...] as the Protector shall in its absolute discretion determine.\"\n* Clause 13.2: \"The Protector, may in a declaration by Deed, made at any time or times during the Trust period declare that any persons or member of a class named or specified [...] in such declaration who is would or might but for this clause be or become entitled to any distribution [...] or be otherwise able to benefit hereunder as the case may be, shall: (a) be wholly or partially excluded from future benefits hereunder [...]\"\n* Clause 13.4: \"The Protector in exercising any of the powers conferred in favour of any particular person is hereby expressly authorised to ignore entirely the interests of any other person interested or who may become interested under this Trust.\"\n* Clause 16.1.1: \"In the manner provided for in this Trust Deed, the Protector shall be responsible for ensuring that the terms of this Trust Deed are complied with and are given effect to. The Protector shall not except as expressly provided for by law, be responsible to the Trustee [or] the Eligible Persons [...] for the manner in which he exercises his duties and discretions hereunder, or for any omission or failure to act, except to the extent that in any circumstance there has been willful negligence, willful default or dishonesty on the part of the Protector.\"\n* Clause 16.2.1: \"The Protector shall have the following powers vested in him: [...] (b) to remove the Trustee or any Trustee at any time from time to time; and (c) to do all such other acts and things incidental to the foregoing and to exercise all powers necessary or useful to carry on the business of the Trust, to promote any of the purposes for which the Trust is formed, and to carry out the provisions contained herein.\"\n* Clause 16.3.1: \"Notwithstanding the provisions of the Applicable Law, the Protector shall have an absolute and uncontrolled discretion in exercising and in deciding whether or not to exercise any power here conferred, and in deciding whether to give or to withhold any consent to any act or thing requiring hereunder the consent of the Protector. The Protector may exercise such discretion upon consideration of such facts or information and in such manner for the benefit of the Eligible Persons or any one or more of them exclusively of the others or other of them as the Protector may think fit and the Protector shall not be liable or accountable in any manner for any exercise of or non-exercise of such discretion.\"106\n\nExhibit C-99.\n\n197.\n\nIn other words, Hampton essentially has full control over Blue Bank\u2019s management of the Qatar Trust. It decides the way in which earnings are distributed after Qatar Notes are paid, it has the power to remove the trustee and, in its capacity as Eligible Person (not a term of art), it is the beneficiary of the earnings distributed at its own discretion, without being accountable to anyone. It is, for all intents and purposes, the \"real\" owner of the purported investment in the BVI Companies.\n\n*The President of the Tribunal differs as to the relevance of control* :\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe President agrees with the majority as concerns the factual situation that Blue Bank\u2019s discretion to act as trustee under the terms of the Trust Deed was totally circumscribed, giving it no control over the management of the trust assets. However, whether this was so or not is without relevance for the question whether Blue Bank may assert jurisdiction under the BIT. Determinative for this question is whether it made the investment on which it relies in its own behalf or not. However, the unanimous conclusion of the Tribunal is that Blue Bank did not make the investment in its own behalf.\n\n**9. OTHER JURISDICTIONAL ARGUMENTS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s holding that the Claimant lacks standing for failure to have invested assets in the host State compels dismissal of the Claimant\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction. It also implies that the other arguments adduced by the Respondent, including that jurisdiction was fabricated by the Claimant in the face of an existing or imminent dispute for the sole purpose of obtaining protection under the BIT (abuse of process),107 do not need to be addressed separately.\n\nMemorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 87-135.\n\n**10. ALLOCATION OF COSTS**\n---------------------------\n\n200.\n\nOn 18 April 2016, the Parties filed their respective Statements of Costs. Comments were exchanged on 3 May 2016.\n\n201.\n\nEach of the Parties has requested to be reimbursed for the legal costs incurred in these proceedings including, in the case of the Respondent, interest.\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted that it incurred a total of USD 1,924,345.06 in legal fees and expenses. It has effected an advance on costs to ICSID in the amount of USD 850,000.00.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted that it incurred a total of USD 1,709,295.00 in legal fees and expenses. It did not contribute by way of advance on costs to ICSID.\n\n204.\n\nAs regards costs, Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\nArticle 61 (1) [...]\n\n(2) In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n205.\n\nAn arbitral tribunal has the discretionary power to allocate the arbitration costs and the legal fees and expenses between the parties, including by ordering the losing party to bear in full the costs of the arbitration and the legal fees and expenses incurred by both parties.\n\n206.\n\nBoth Parties to this arbitration have submitted requests for reimbursement in respect of their respective legal costs.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal is well aware of the practices of certain arbitration tribunals not to make any order for legal costs. However, there is an increasing trend to acknowledge that a successful party should not normally be left out of pocket in respect of the legal costs reasonably incurred in defending its legal rights.\n\n208.\n\nThe Tribunal favors the approach taken by the Parties - which is implicit in their requests for cost orders - that as a general principle the successful party should be paid its reasonable legal costs by the unsuccessful party.\n\n209.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's finding that the Claimant does not prevail on the preliminary question of jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers it appropriate for the Claimant to bear in full its legal fees and expenses, as well as the arbitration costs.\n\n210.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):108\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses\n\nChrister S\u00f6derlund USD 314,441.12  \nGeorge Bermann USD 115,595.99  \nLoretta Malintoppi USD 144,820.86  \nICSID's administrative fees USD 128,000.00  \nDirect expenses (estimated)109 USD 90,044.27\n\n**Total**  **USD 792,902.24**\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\nThis amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (courier, printing and copying).\n\n211.\n\nFor the same reason as explained above, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that the Claimant also be ordered to reimburse the Respondent's legal fees and expenses in the amounts requested. The Tribunal finds the Respondent's request for such costs reasonable.\n\n212.\n\nConsequently, the Claimant is ordered to pay to the Respondent the amount of USD 1,709,295.00, representing the Respondent's legal fees and expenses.\n\n213.\n\nAs for interest on the Respondent's legal costs, the Tribunal considers that any delay in respect of the Claimant's reimbursement of costs shall attract interest. The Respondent has not specified from which date it considers that interest shall accrue or at what rate. The Tribunal will therefore base these parameters on reasonableness and fix the commencement date at 30 days from the date of this Award applying an annual simple interest rate of 5 per cent.\n\n214.\n\nAs for the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of ICSID facilities, these costs will be defrayed out of the advances made by the Claimant. Having regard to the Tribunal's decision that the Claimant shall be ultimately liable for arbitration costs, there will be no order for those costs.\n\n**11. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n215.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously:\n\n1) Declares that the Centre does not have jurisdiction and the Arbitral Tribunal does not have competence to adjudicate the present dispute;\n\n2) Declares that the Claimant shall bear in full its legal costs and expenses, the costs of this arbitration, as well as the Respondent's legal costs and expenses;\n\n3) Orders the Claimant to pay to the Respondent the amount of USD 1,709,295.00, representing the Respondent's legal costs and expenses, within 30 days from the date of this Award, together with interest thereon calculated from the 30th day following the date of this Award at the rate of 5% per annum."}]}
