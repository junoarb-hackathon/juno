Given this, in the event that a non-disputing Party wishes, or anticipates that it may wish, to make oral submissions, this must be notified to the disputing Parties in writing in a timely manner. Failing this, subject to the Tribunal's latitude to depart from this approach if the circumstances so warrant, the Tribunal would not be minded to permit oral submissions by a non-disputing Party that have not been notified in writing to the disputing Parties in a timely manner. In proceeding in this manner, the Tribunal notes that it is following the approach taken by the NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunal in the case of Eli Lilly v. Canada [Transcript, Day 8, 8 June 2016, pp.1983 \u20131989].\n\n6) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties have a right to reply to any submissions, whether written or oral, of a non-disputing Party.\n\nThe US and Mexico are requested to confirm, at their earliest convenience, to the Tribunal and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \u201cPCA\u201d) the names and contact details of their representatives and counsel for purposes of the present proceedings.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present Order is made in an arbitration between Tennant Energy, LLC (the \"**Claimant**\") and the Government of Canada (\"**Canada**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"), pursuant to Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\") and the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as adopted in 1976 (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties concerns the Respondent\u2019s alleged breaches under Chapter 11, Section A of the NAFTA through the application of the 2011 Feed-in Tariff Program (the \"**FIT Program**\") in respect of the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment in Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc. (\"**Skyway 127**\"), an enterprise incorporated in Ontario, Canada.\n\n3.\n\nAt issue in this Order are the following applications:\n\n(a) The Claimant\u2019s Request for Interim Measures, dated 16 August 2019 (the \"**Request for Interim Measures**\"), in which it requested that the Tribunal order (i) the disputing parties to preserve, index, protect, and scan documentation in their possession, custody, or control that is relevant to the dispute; and (ii) the Respondent to produce within 30 days the non-confidential documents on record in the *Windstream Energy LLC v. Government of Canada* case in their entirety to the Claimant, along with an index;\n\n(b) The Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation, submitted on 23 September 2019 (the \"**Request for Bifurcation**\") to address in a preliminary procedure the Respondent\u2019s NAFTA Article 1116(2) time-bar jurisdictional objection; and\n\n(c) The Respondent\u2019s Motion for Security for Costs, and in the same submission, its Motion for the Disclosure of Third-Party Funding, dated 16 August 2019 (the \"**Motion for Security for Costs**\" and \"**Motion for the Disclosure of Third Party Funding**\"), in which it requested the Tribunal to order the Claimant to (i) issue security for costs in the amount of 6,934,001.95 CAD, by depositing the security into an escrow account arranged by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\") within 90 days of the order, or the arbitral proceedings will be discontinued; and (ii) disclose the existence of any third-party funding agreement that the Claimant has entered into to finance its claim in this arbitration, the name(s) and details of the third-party funder(s), and the nature of the arrangements concluded with the third-party funder(s), including whether and to what extent it/they will share in any successes that Claimant may achieve in this arbitration, or pay an adverse costs order against the Claimant.\n\n**II. RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY1**\n------------------------------------\n\nGiven its nature, this Order will contain only recitals of the factual background and procedural history needed to resolve the issues arising in respect of various applications. These matters will be addressed in more detail in the Final Award, as appropriate, in light of the future pleadings of the Parties, which will follow in due course.\n\n4.\n\nOn 24 June 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO 1**\") which, *inter alia*, provided that these proceedings shall be governed by the UNCITRAL Rules, except as modified by the provisions of Chapter 11, Section B of the NAFTA, and set out the procedural calendar in its Annex 1. The procedural calendar provided for an \"Initial Phase\", comprising of (i) the Parties\u2019 submissions on bifurcation and any preliminary motions; (ii) the non-disputing Parties' submissions on questions of law related to the interpretation of the NAFTA on bifurcation; (iii) the Parties' responses to the non-disputing Parties' submissions; (iv) a hearing on the issues of bifurcation and preliminary motions, which would take place from 14 to 15 January 2020 (the \"**Hearing**\"); and (v) the Tribunal's decision on bifurcation and any preliminary motions. In addition, the procedural calendar set forth two subsequent alternative timetables applicable (i) should the proceedings not be bifurcated; or (ii) should the proceedings be bifurcated.\n\n5.\n\nOn 16 August 2019, the Respondent submitted its Motion for Security for Costs and Disclosure of Third-Party Funding (\"**Motion for Security for Costs**\"), accompanied by exhibits R-001 to R-013 and legal authorities RLA-001 to RLA-051.\n\n6.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant submitted its **Request for Interim Measures**, accompanied by legal authorities CLA-001 to CLA-052.\n\n7.\n\nOn 23 September 2019, the Claimant submitted its Response to Canada's Motion for Security for Costs and Disclosure of Funding (\"**Response to the Motion for Security for Costs**\"), accompanied by legal authorities CLA-001 to CLA-070.\n\n8.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent submitted its **Request for Bifurcation** and, in a separate filing, its Response to the Claimant's Request for Interim Measures (\"**Response to the Request for Interim Measures**\"), accompanied by exhibits R-001 to R-023 and legal authorities RLA-001 to RLA-088.\n\n9.\n\nOn 23 October 2019, the Claimant submitted its Response to the Request for Bifurcation (\"**Response to the Request for Bifurcation**\"), accompanied by exhibits C-001 to C-017 and legal authorities CLA-001 to CLA-071.\n\n10.\n\nOn 1 November 2019, the United States (\"**U.S.**\") submitted a letter to the Tribunal noting *inter alia* that it did not intend to make any submissions in connection with the request for bifurcation, but may wish to do so in connection with the Parties' preliminary motions. The U.S. proposed to inform the Tribunal and the Parties whether it will make such submissions by 27 November 2019, and file any such submissions by 6 December 2019. The U.S. also reserved its right to make oral submissions during the Hearing, pursuant to Article 1128 of the NAFTA.\n\n11.\n\nOn 2 November 2019, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal (i) objecting to the U.S.' proposed procedural schedule and maintaining that any non-disputing Party submissions should be provided no later than 6 November 2019; and (ii) objecting to the U.S.' participation at the upcoming Hearing.\n\n12.\n\nOn 3 November 2019, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the U.S.' and the Claimant's correspondence of 1 and 2 November 2019, respectively, by 4 November 2019.\n\n13.\n\nOn 4 November 2019, Mexico submitted a letter to the Tribunal informing that it did not intend to make a submission on bifurcation, expressing its intention to attend the January 2020 hearing and reserving its right to make any oral submissions then, and joining the U.S. in its proposal to inform the Tribunal and the Parties whether it will make submissions on the Parties' preliminary motions by 27 November 2019, and file any such submissions by 6 December 2019.\n\n14.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal arguing *inter alia* that (i) under the NAFTA, the non-disputing Parties have a right to make submissions on questions of interpretation of the NAFTA and that their proposed timetable is reasonable; and (ii) the non-disputing Parties have a right under the NAFTA to attend hearings and make oral submissions.\n\n15.\n\nOn 5 November 2019, in reaction to the 4 November 2019 letter from Mexico, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal requesting that it (i) set a new date, which shall be no later than 8 November 2019, for the filing of all remaining non-disputing Party submissions; and (ii) reaffirm its prior decision as reflected in Procedural Order No. 1 that the non-disputing Parties should not be allowed to attend the Hearing.\n\n16.\n\nOn 11 November 2019, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties and non-disputing Parties directing *inter alia* that (i) the non-disputing Parties inform the Tribunal by 13 November 2019 whether they will be making any submissions on the Parties' preliminary motions, and file any such submissions by 27 November 2019; (ii) the Parties file their responses, if any, to any non-disputing Party submissions, by 27 December 2019; and (iii) the non-disputing Parties shall be allowed to attend the Hearing, and make any oral submissions to the extent that they have given timely notice to the Parties in writing.\n\n17.\n\nOn 13 November 2019, the U.S. and Mexico informed the Tribunal that they expect to make submissions on questions of interpretation of the NAFTA in connection with the Parties' preliminary motions.\n\n18.\n\nOn 18 November 2019, the Respondent submitted a revised version of RLA-006, and sought the Tribunal's guidance on the agenda and time allocation for the Hearing.\n\n19.\n\nOn 20 November 2019, the Tribunal *inter alia* informed the Parties that it wished to hear oral submissions on the Respondent's request for bifurcation and all the Parties' preliminary motions during the Hearing, and requested the Parties to confer and jointly propose a draft hearing schedule by 6 December 2019.\n\n20.\n\nOn 27 November 2019, the U.S. and Mexico submitted their respective submissions on questions of interpretation of the NAFTA, pursuant to Article 1128 of the Treaty (the \"**U.S.\u2019 Article 1128 Submission**\" and \"**Mexico\u2019s Article 1128 Submission**\").\n\n21.\n\nOn 6 December 2019, the Parties submitted their respective proposed hearing schedules for the Hearing, as well as their comments with respect to the various disputed aspects.\n\n22.\n\nOn 27 December 2019, the Parties submitted their respective responses to the non-disputing Parties' submissions of 27 November 2019 (the \"**Claimant\u2019s Response to the non-Disputing Parties\u2019 Submission** s\" and \"**Respondent\u2019s Response to the non-Disputing Parties\u2019 Submissions**\").\n\n23.\n\nOn 28 December 2019, the Tribunal circulated to the Parties a final schedule for the Hearing.\n\n24.\n\nOn 3 January 2020, the Tribunal invited the non-disputing Parties to clarify by 7 January 2020 whether they intend to make any oral submissions at the Hearing and, if so, whether they have notified this in a timely manner to the Disputing Parties.\n\n25.\n\nOn 7 January 2020, the non-disputing Parties respectively informed the Tribunal and the Parties that the U.S., but not Mexico, intends to make oral submissions at the Hearing.\n\n26.\n\nOn 8 January 2020, the Tribunal circulated the final schedule and list of attendees for the Hearing.\n\n27.\n\nThe Hearing took place from 14 to 15 January 2020 at the World Bank Main Complex Building, Building C, 1225 Connecticut Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. Non-confidential portions of the Hearing were broadcast live to a separate conference room at the hearing venue accessible to the public.\n\n28.\n\nOn 4 February 2020, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to submit the 27 January 2020 Decision on the Respondent's Request for Security for Costs and the Claimant's Request for Security for Claim in the *Dirk Herzig as Insolvency Administrator over the Assets of Unionmatex Industrieanlagen GmbH v. Turkmenistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/18/35) case *(\"**Dirk Herzig v. Turkmenistan**\")* into the record, \"and to allow the disputing parties, should the Tribunal wish, to make brief, concise written submissions on the relevance of the decision\" to the Respondent's Motion for Security for Costs. The Respondent justified its request on the basis that the decision, which is directly relevant, had only been released that day and the Respondent thus could not have introduced it into the record any earlier.\n\n29.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's request, alleging that the \"additional costs arising from Canada's requests, when coupled with the delay arising from the due process obligations owed to the disputing parties, are disproportionately high\" and that in any event, the decision the Respondent seeks to introduce is irrelevant because \"the test for ICSID Convention interim measures provisions differ from the terms of Art 26 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the governing provisions in NAFTA Article 1134.\"\n\n30.\n\nOn 5 February 2020, the Respondent clarified that the decision that it sought to submit into the record could be found on IA Reporter, a publicly available website.\n\n31.\n\nOn 10 February 2020, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's 4 February 2020 request and invited the Parties to file submissions on the Decision in *Dirk Herzig v. Turkmenistan*.\n\n32.\n\nOn 17 February 2020, the Respondent submitted the Decision in *Dirk Herzig v. Turkmenistan* into the record, together with a written submission.\n\n33.\n\nOn 24 February 2020, the Claimant filed its written submission on the Decision in *Dirk Herzig v. Turkmenistan*.\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will review the Parties' and the non-disputing Parties' positions and arguments in respect of the applications before the Tribunal. Naturally, this section is not meant to serve as an exhaustive review of the Parties' and the non-disputing Parties' submissions on the applications at issue, but a summary of the arguments that are relevant to the Tribunal's analysis and findings. Regardless, the Tribunal has carefully considered all of the submissions made by the Parties and the non-disputing Parties, whether in writing or made orally during the Hearing.\n\n**A. CLAIMANT\u2019S REQUEST FOR INTERIM MEASURES**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nIn its Request for Interim Measures, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal (i) order the Parties to preserve and protect documentation in their possession, custody, or control that is relevant to the dispute (the \"**Protected Documents**\"), including in particular documents \"relevant to the Investor, the Investment, and the award electrical power transmission access or contracts under the Ontario [FIT Program] and/or any related policies or measures\";2 and (ii) order the Respondent to produce non-confidential documentation on record in *Windstream Energy v. Canada* (the ***\"Windstream*** **Documents**\").3 The Claimant also requests the Tribunal to order the reimbursement of its reasonable legal and other costs incurred in connection with its request for interim measures.4\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 2(a), FN 3.\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 36, *referring to Windstream Energy LLC v. Canada*, PCA Case 2013-22 (\"*Windstream Energy v. Canada*\").\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 37.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal should reject the Claimant's request and reserves its right to claim the costs incurred in responding thereto.5\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 38-39.\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant submits its request for interim measures in the context of what it considers to be a systemic lack of transparency in Ontario's administration of the FIT Program, perpetuated by, among other things, the suppression and destruction of relevant evidence. The Claimant asserts that this suppressed evidence, which only became publicly available through the release of information in the *Mesa Power v. Canada* and *Windstream v. Canada* arbitration proceedings, reveals the extent of Ontario's unlawful conduct which resulted in the breaches of NAFTA the Claimant alleges in these proceedings. Moreover, the Claimant contends that information that is \"relevant to [its] case and may reveal further unlawful behavior that harmed its investment\" continues to be withheld, and its repeated requests to the Respondent to take steps to collect and preserve evidence related to the dispute were either ignored or rejected.\n\n38.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimant considers the relief sought to be \"necessary to preserve the *status quo*, ensure the availability of information necessary for [it] to make its claim fully and fairly, and enable [it] and [the Tribunal] to proceed without an asymmetry of relevant information relative to Canada.\"6\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 12.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant contends that NAFTA Article 1134 and Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules both provide that the Tribunal has the authority to order interim measures.7 Article 1134 of the NAFTA expressly provides that, in exercising such authority, the Tribunal may grant an \"order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party.\"8 Similarly, the Claimant notes that the non-exhaustive list of categories of interim measures under Article 26(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules encompasses the relief it seeks.9 Accordingly, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal has the power to grant both of its requested interim measures.10\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16.\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 13, *quoting* Article 1134 of the NAFTA.\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 17, *referring to* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22 (\"*Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*\"), Procedural Order No. 1, 31 March 2006, \u00b6 84 (**CLA-45**).\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 17.\n\n40.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant submits that it is entitled to the interim measures requested because it has satisfied all the relevant criteria under the relevant rules,11 namely \"(a) a risk of serious or irreparable harm; (b) urgency; (c) no prejudgment of the merits of a case; and (d) a *prima facie* case on the merits\".12 In this regard, the Claimant notes that \"in determining whether to grant interim measures, most tribunals also balance the harm the Investor is likely to suffer in the absence of interim measures against the harm likely to result to the respondent if the measures are granted\".13\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 28.\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 20, *referring to* Gary Born, *International Commercial Arbitration* (2014), 2468 (**CLA-44**).\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 20, *referring to* Gary Born, *International Commercial Arbitration* (2014), 2468 (**CLA-44**).\n\n41.\n\nFirst, the Claimant alleges that it will suffer a risk of serious and imminent harm if the Tribunal fails to grant the interim relief requested. In particular, the Claimant considers that \"[t]here is a material risk that relevant Documents will be lost or destroyed given past patterns of conduct by the Ontario Government.\"14 The Claimant also contends that \"[w]ithout the *Windstream* documents in particular, neither the Investor nor the Tribunal will benefit from the information already available to Canada and one of the arbitrators from their participation [in that case].\"15\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 29; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 83:6-20.\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 29(b).\n\n42.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that its request is urgent because, as in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, the requested documents must be preserved before the proceedings progress any further, in order to enable each Party to properly plead their case.16 The Claimant further claims that the urgency of its request is \"further pronounced\" with respect to the *Windstream* Documents because if it is not granted, only the Respondent and one arbitrator on the Tribunal will have access to this relevant information when considering the Parties\u2019 motions and upcoming pleadings.17\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 31, *citing* *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, \u00b6 86 (**CLA-45**).\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 31; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 82:12-16.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimant similarly rejects the Respondent\u2019s claim that its request for the *Windstream* Documents is not urgent and can simply be made during the document production phase. In the Claimant\u2019s view, given the *Windstream* Documents\u2019 \"obvious and potential relevance and materiality to the issues in dispute\",18 it is important that the Claimant and the entire Tribunal have access to this information as soon as possible, and \"there is no additional burden in asking Canada to provide it at this time.\"19\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 32.\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 31, *referring to* Transcript of the First Procedural Hearing, 129:7-17; *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, \u00b6 86 (**CLA-45**).\n\n44.\n\nWith respect to the third and fourth criteria, the Claimant contends that it \"has demonstrated a strong *prima facie* case on the merits, [and] granting the relief requested would by no means prejudge the merits of the case.\"20 In addition, according to the Claimant, \"the evidence in question is likely to be relevant to the substantive jurisdictional and merits issues that the Tribunal must decide,\" and accordingly, \"refusing to grant the relief requested would effectively prejudge those issues by the Tribunal choosing to leave itself in the position of adjudicating them without all relevant facts.\"21\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 33, *citing* *Paushok v. Mongolia* (UNCITRAL), Order on Interim Measures, 2 September 2008, \u00b6 55 (**CLA-46**).\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 33, *referring to* *Biwater Gauff v.

The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent largely agrees with the Claimant that in order to determine whether interim measures are necessary pursuant to Article 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules the Tribunal must consider whether \"(i) *prima facie*, there is a reasonable possibility that the disputing party advancing the motion would prevail in the case; (ii) the disputing party would likely suffer harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages without the order; (iii) the disputing party's potential harm without the order substantially outweighs the harm that the other disputing party would likely incur from the order; and (iv) the condition of urgency is met.\"25 The Respondent contends that since the Claimant has failed to meet its burden of satisfying each of these elements the Tribunal should decline both of the Claimant's requests.26\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16; Response to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6 2.\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6 3.\n\n47.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's requested order for Canada to preserve, index, protect, and scan documents, first, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to satisfy its burden to prove, *prima facie*, that it has a reasonable possibility of prevailing in this case. In this respect, the Respondent reiterates that the Claimant's claims are time-barred under Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA, and that any information that may be obtained during this arbitration is not necessary to rule on the time-bar issue.27\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 46; Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 10-22; Response to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6 6, *referring to* Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 96:6-11.\n\n48.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the Claimant \"has failed to demonstrate it will suffer any harm if the tribunal refuses to grant an order for the preservation and protection of documents.\"28 The Respondent submits that it \"has already put in place robust procedures to preserve and protect documents that may be relevant to this dispute\", and which \"effectively render Tennant's request unnecessary.\"29 For example, the Respondent explains, the Archives and Recordkeeping Act in force since September 2007, and Ontario's Corporate Policy on Recordkeeping of July 2011 and March 2015 (\"**Recordkeeping Policy 2015**\"), all have as one of their main objectives the management and preservation of public records.30 In particular, Ontario's Corporate Policy on Recordkeeping of 2015, *inter alia,* expressly prohibits ministries from destroying records in their possession that may be subject to a legal proceeding until they are notified that the matter has been concluded.31\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6 15.\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 96:12-97:23.\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 8-10, *referring to* Archives and Recordkeeping Act, 2006, S.O. 2006, c. 34, Sched.

These importantly include, the Respondent contends, procedures that assist with determining the relevance and materiality of the *Windstream* Documents, and narrowing the scope of documents to be produced in this proceeding, in accordance with the International Bar Association (\"**IBA**\") Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration.40 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant has not provided any basis for it to circumvent the requirement to justify the relevance and materiality of its document requests, and acceding to the Claimant\u2019s request would accordingly be \"procedurally unfair\" and \"lead to the Claimant unilaterally benefitting from an early production of documents.\"41\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 24-33; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 99:12-101:3.\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 26-33.\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6 33.\n\n55.\n\nThird, in the Respondent's view, it would be unduly burdensome for it to produce the *Windstream* Documents at this stage of the arbitration, \"particularly since [they] are not relevant to Canada's time bar objection, and because the Claimant has not proven the relevance and materiality of the documents requested to its claim.\"42\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6 35, *referring to* Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 26-28; Statement of Defence, \u00b6 27.\n\n56.\n\nFourth, the Respondent argues that \"[t]here are no urgent circumstances requiring the Tribunal to order Canada to produce the *Windstream* Documents.\" In this respect, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant \"provides no evidence that any relevant and material documents are necessary in order for the Tribunal to rule on Canada's jurisdictional objection on time bar, nor has it provided any evidence that such documents have been or will be suppressed or destroyed during the course of this arbitration.\"43\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6 36; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 101:21-24.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Decision**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant is seeking (i) an order that the Respondent produce the *Windstream* Documents at this stage of the arbitration; and (ii) an order that the Parties preserve, index and protect the Protected Documents. It is undisputed that the Tribunal has authority to grant the interim measures sought pursuant to Article 1134 of the NAFTA and Article 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.44\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 13-14; Response to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6 2.\n\n58.\n\nArticle 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides *inter alia* that the Tribunal may make any interim measures it deems \"necessary\" in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute. While Article 26(1) does not make explicit the criteria which the Tribunal should apply in determining whether an interim measure is \"necessary\", the Tribunal notes that the Parties largely agree that the requesting party would be required to show that there is, amongst others, a risk of serious or irreparable harm and that the condition of urgency is met.45\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 20; Response to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6 2.\n\n59.\n\nTurning to the Claimant's request that the Respondent produce the *Windstream* Documents at this stage of the arbitration, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it is necessary for the Tribunal to order an early production of these documents, which would require the Tribunal to depart from the timelines and procedures for document production set out in PO 1. In the Tribunal's view, the Claimant's request that the *Windstream* Documents be produced is in essence a discovery request which may be made at the document production stage.\n\n60.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal fails to see any risk of serious or irreparable harm to the Claimant if the *Windstream* Documents are not produced now. The Claimant has not provided any reason for the *Windstream* Documents to be treated differently from any other document requests which would require proof of the various requirements for document production in accordance with the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration, including relevance and materiality.\n\n61.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant has made no attempt to argue that the *Windstream* Documents are relevant and material with reference to its pleaded claims.46 Instead, the thrust of the Claimant's argument was that the documents have to be produced urgently because, without them in the Claimant's possession, only the Respondent and one of the three arbitrators will have knowledge of them.47 It is unclear to the Tribunal how that would result in serious or irreparable harm to the Claimant if the *Windstream* Documents, assuming they are relevant and material, are produced only at the discovery stage.\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), 32; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 89:24-90:19.\n\nRequest for Interim Measures, \u00b6 31; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 82:12-23, 85:23-86:2, 87:8-17.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal is also unable to agree with the Claimant that there are urgent circumstances requiring the Tribunal to order the Respondent to produce the *Windstream* Documents now.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent has stated at the Hearing that it has in its possession electronic copies of the *Windstream* Documents.48 Further, the *Windstream* Documents which the Claimant is now seeking are documents that were produced and are on the record of the Windstream arbitration. The Claimant does not dispute that these documents are securely held by PCA in its archives.49 In other words, it is clear that there are presently two available sources of the *Windstream* Documents, namely the Respondent's internal records and the PCA's archives.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 109:8-9.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 86:20-87:2.\n\n64.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal were to conclude at a later stage that *Windstream* Documents are to be produced in this arbitration, and for whatever reason the *Windstream* Documents held by the Respondent are lost, there is nothing which prevents the Claimant from requesting access to the *Windstream* Documents stored in the PCA's archives. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent has unambiguously waived any objections to the PCA producing the *Windstream* Documents if that were the case.50 The Tribunal is therefore not satisfied that the requirement of urgency is met.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 120:6-121:4.\n\n65.\n\nAs for the Claimant's request that the Tribunal orders that the Parties preserve, index and protect the Protected Documents, the Tribunal is similarly not persuaded that such an order is necessary at this stage.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent has explained51 that it has put in place procedures to preserve and protect documents that may be relevant to the dispute.\n\nResponse to the Request for Interim Measures, \u00b6 8 to 15.\n\n67.\n\nHaving been informed, in confidential session, of the steps that the Respondent has put in place to protect and preserve the Protected Documents, the Tribunal is satisfied that these steps are sufficient. It is also unclear to the Tribunal what further steps the Respondent could take to preserve and protect the Protected Documents. Consequently, the Tribunal is not convinced that there is a risk of serious or irreparable harm or that the condition of urgency is met.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that both Parties have stated unambiguously that it is important for Parties to take active steps to preserve evidence relevant to this case. The Tribunal expects the Parties to continue to be mindful of the need to ensure that relevant evidence is preserved and remains available.\n\n69.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Claimant\u2019s request for interim measures is dismissed.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT\u2019S REQUEST FOR BIFURCATION**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent requests that, for reasons of fairness and procedural efficiency, the Tribunal should bifurcate the proceedings and address as a preliminary question its jurisdictional objection concerning Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA.52 Under this objection, the Respondent submits the Claimant\u2019s claims are time-barred because it knew, or should have known, about the alleged loss or damage more than three years before it submitted its claim to arbitration *(i.e.,* before 1 June 2014).53 The Respondent does not propose that the Tribunal address its other jurisdictional objections in a preliminary phase because they may be more closely intertwined with the merits of the dispute.54\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 29; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 128:13-19.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 28-39; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 128:20-130:8.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 5.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules grants the Tribunal the discretion to bifurcate the proceedings and at the same time \"creates a clear presumption in favour of bifurcating jurisdictional questions.\"55 Not only have NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals \"frequently decided questions of jurisdiction as a preliminary matter\", the Respondent also points out that such \"questions of jurisdiction\" often include time-bar issues.56 In deciding whether or not to bifurcate the proceedings into a separate jurisdictional phase, the Respondent asserts that tribunals have been guided by the principles of fairness and efficiency57 and have considered whether the jurisdictional objection(s) at stake (i) are *prima facie* serious and substantial; (ii) can be examined without prejudging or entering the merits; and (iii) if successful, could dispose of all or an essential part of the claims.58\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, *citing* *Resolute Forest Products Inc. v.

With respect to the first criterion, the Respondent submits that in examining whether it has been met, a tribunal is \"only required to be satisfied that the objections are not frivolous or vexatious.\"59 In this regard, the Respondent asserts that its objection is serious as \"it goes to the very basis of the Tribunal's authority to hear [the Claimant's claims].\"60 According to the Respondent, the limitation period enshrined in Article 1116(2) has been strictly applied by NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals, and expressly recognized as \"an integral aspect of the NAFTA Parties' consent to arbitration.\"61 Since the Claimant did not submit its claim within the required three-year period, the Respondent has not consented to arbitration this claim.62\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 11, *citing* *Resolute v.

United States*, the Claimant asserts that in considering the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation the Tribunal \"should take [the Claimant's] claim as alleged.\"83 In this case, the Claimant points out, it has clearly explained in its Notice of Arbitration that it only obtained knowledge of the Respondent's alleged breaches less than three years before it submitted its Notice of Arbitration on 1 June 2017.84\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 18.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 5, *referring to Glamis Gold v.

Canada* and *Windstream Energy v. Canada* cases, which were only publicly disclosed after 1 June 2014.85 This includes, for the example, (i) the claims in *Mesa Power v. Canada* on 4 June 2014; (ii) the terms of the Green Energy Investment Agreement (\"**GEIA**\"), which were disclosed as a part of the proceedings in *Mesa Power v. Canada* between 4 June 2014 and 30 April 2015; (iii) the transcript of the hearing in *Mesa Power v. Canada* on 30 April 2015; and (iv) the award in *Windstream Energy v. Canada* on 6 December 2016.86\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 9; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 178:7-12.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 7, *referring to* Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 117. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 178:1-12.\n\n83.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it only found out about the \"wrongful actions\" it alleges the Respondent undertook after the hearing transcripts and the post-hearing briefs in *Mesa Power v. Canada* were published in December 2014.87 Through testimony that was provided by one of the witnesses in the *Mesa Power v. Canada* case, for example, the Claimant claims that it found out for the first time that preferential treatment and protection was given to International Power Canada, a Canadian company, which resulted in the Claimant's loss of a multi-million dollar FIT contract.88 In this regard, the Claimant clarifies that it was not simply the loss of the FIT Contract that forms the basis of its claims, but the reasons for this loss, which was only revealed later through the disclosure of the above-mentioned documents.89 Similarly, the Claimant points out that the Respondent's alleged destruction of material evidence only came to light as a result of certain relevant documents published in 2015 within the context of the *Mesa Power v. Canada* and *Windstream Energy v. Canada* cases.90\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15, *referring to Mesa Power Group v. Canada*, Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, 18 December 2014, \u00b6 1 (**C-017**).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 166:10-167:17.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 180:9-11.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 16.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant also disputes the Respondent's claim that because *Mesa Power* had sufficient knowledge to bring its claim and file its Notice of Arbitration in 2011, the Claimant should similarly have had the knowledge to file its current claim then. According to the Claimant, while the two cases arise out of the same factual matrix, namely Ontario's FIT Program, the claims in both cases, and the alleged wrongful conduct, are entirely different.91 Indeed, the Claimant notes, the critical facts that form the basis of its claims cannot be found in *Mesa Power's* Notice of Arbitration because they were not public at the time, and were only disclosed later in the arbitration, through witness testimony and documents that were submitted by Canada.92\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 209:21-210:13.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 209:21-210:13.\n\n85.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that granting the Respondent's request for bifurcation would not materially reduce the time and costs of these proceedings.93 In this respect, the Claimant reiterates that because Respondent's time-bar objection lacks merit, regardless of whether the Tribunal addresses it as a preliminary question, \"there will be a merits hearing of some scope in this case.\"94 Similarly, if the Respondent's time-bar objection is upheld only with respect to part of the claims, there will still be a need to undertake a merits phase. In addition, the Claimant noted that should the Tribunal decide to bifurcate the proceedings, the initial phase would not be significantly shorter since the Claimant intends to both seek document production and submit witness testimony for purposes of the time-bar issue.95 For these reasons, the Claimant submits that bifurcating the proceedings would in fact unnecessarily increase the costs and duration of proceedings.96\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 19-25.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 20.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 187:3-18, 200:23-201:16.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 21-25.\n\n86.\n\nFinally, in the Claimant's view, the Respondent's time-bar objection is closely intertwined with the merits of the case and will require the Tribunal to delve inappropriately into merits issues.97 The Claimant points out that all of its claims relate to \"surreptitious actions taken by government officials outside the public purview\" and, as such, the questions of if and when these actions occurred and were disclosed to the public would have to be dealt with both in determining the Respondent's time-bar objection and the Claimant's claims.98 Furthermore, the Claimant underscores that the tribunal in *Mesa Power v. Canada,* decided to reverse its decision to bifurcate proceedings because it considered that one of the jurisdictional objections which pertained to the timelines of the claims pursuant the so-called \"cooling-off period\" under Article 1120(1) of the NAFTA could not be decided \"'without substantially engaging in the facts of the dispute.'\"99 As in *Mesa Power v. Canada*, the Claimant considers that addressing the question of when the Claimant first knew or should have known about the alleged breaches and corresponding losses and damages requires delving into the merits of the Claimant's claims, thereby making it inappropriate for the Tribunal to consider the Respondent's time-bar objection as a preliminary question.100\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 26-34.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 30-34, *quoting Mesa Power v.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Decision**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIn the exercise of its discretion to bifurcate, the Tribunal is guided by three relevant considerations. These considerations are (i) whether the jurisdictional objection is frivolous; (ii) whether the objection, if successful, would materially reduce the time and costs of the proceeding; and (iii) whether the objection concerns issues intertwined with the merits of the arbitration.101\n\n*Glamis Gold v. United States*, \u00b6 12(c) (**RLA-054**).\n\n88.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 submissions on this issue, the Tribunal has decided to dismiss the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation on the ground that it is premature.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal has been directed to paragraph 91 of the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Arbitration dated 1 June 2017 (\"**NOA**\").102 Paragraph 91 of the NOA refers to \"four categories of wrongful actions\" purportedly committed by the Respondent, namely (i) the unfair manipulation of the award of access to the electricity transmission grid; (ii) the unfair manipulation of the dissemination of the FIT Program information; (iii) the unfair manipulation of the awarding of the FIT Program Contracts; and (iv) the improper destruction of necessary and material evidence by senior officials in the Government of Ontario. However, the NOA simply does not contain sufficient particulars of each category of wrongdoing which would allow the Tribunal to take a view, one way or another, on whether the Tribunal can determine the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection without entering into the merits.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 16.\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondent has requested that the Tribunal bifurcate the proceedings to consider the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection that the Claimant allegedly failed to meet the conditions precedent for submitting a claim to arbitration pursuant to Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA. According to the Respondent, the NOA was filed more than three years after the Claimant first acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that it incurred loss or damage as a result of that breach and as such, the claim is time-barred.103\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 1.\n\n91.\n\nBefore the Tribunal can make an assessment of whether to bifurcate the proceedings, the Tribunal will need to know what evidence it will likely have to consider in determining the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection and whether the Tribunal will be substantially engaging in the facts of the dispute when considering that evidence. However, until the Tribunal is informed of the specific breach in question which the Respondent now contends is time-barred, the Tribunal does not know what evidence will likely be adduced or the evidence it will likely have to consider in assessing *when* the Claimant acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of that breach. Consequently, the Tribunal is unable to decide at this stage whether an inquiry into the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection will be best conducted with the merits phase when the Tribunal will have the benefit of the entire record or whether the jurisdictional objection should be heard as a preliminary issue. The Tribunal needs to see the Claimant\u2019s claims in more detail before it can decide whether the proceedings can be bifurcated. The Tribunal cannot decide whether to bifurcate the proceedings or not if there is no specificity to the claims. For these reasons, the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation is premature.\n\n92.\n\nHaving dismissed the Respondent's request for bifurcation, the Parties are to proceed with the procedural timetable set out in PO 1 for the scenario where the proceedings are *not* bifurcated.\n\n93.\n\nHowever, given the Tribunal's finding that the Respondent's request for bifurcation is premature, the Tribunal makes the following modifications to the procedural timetable:\n\n(a) The Claimant is to set out in full its detailed pleading on the issue of jurisdiction in its Memorial and specifically on the issue of time-bar which has been raised by the Respondent. In accordance with the procedural timetable set out in PO 1, this Memorial is due to be filed 90 days from the date of this Procedural Order (*i.e.* **Wednesday, 27 May 2020**).\n\n(b) Should the Respondent wish to pursue bifurcation of the proceedings after having had sight of the Claimant's Memorial, the Respondent is to file its detailed objections on jurisdiction and a request for bifurcation within 45 days from the date of the Claimant's Memorial *(i.e.***Monday, 13 July 2020**).\n\n(c) If the Respondent files a request for bifurcation in accordance with (b) above, the Claimant is to file its response to the Respondent's request for bifurcation within 21 days from the date of that request (*i.e.***Monday, 3 August 2020**).\n\n(d) After receiving the above submissions, the Tribunal will decide **on the papers without a hearing** on whether the proceedings should be bifurcated. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that it has had the benefit of extensive arguments by Parties on the issue of bifurcation and the oral arguments made at the Hearing in particular have been of assistance to the Tribunal. In the interests of expediency and to save time and costs for all Parties, the Tribunal is confident that it can address a second bifurcation request without a further hearing.\n\n(e) The Tribunal will issue the relevant procedural directions after it has come to a decision on the Respondent's second bifurcation request, including any adjustments to the procedural timetable where necessary.\n\n(f) Should the Respondent choose *not* to pursue bifurcation of the proceedings after having had sight of the Claimant's Memorial, the timelines will continue to run in accordance with the procedural timetable set out in PO 1.\n\n**C. RESPONDENT\u2019S MOTION FOR DISCLOSURE OF THIRD-PARTY FUNDING**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted a motion requesting that the Tribunal order the Claimant to \"[d]isclose the existence of any third-party funding agreement that [the Claimant] entered to finance its claim in this arbitration, the name(s) and details of the third-party funder(s), and the nature of the arrangements concluded with the third-party funder(s), including whether and to what extent it/they will share in any successes that [the Claimant] may achieve in this arbitration, or pay an adverse costs order against [the Claimant].\"104\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 46(b).\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal reject the Respondent's motion and order the Respondent to reimburse the costs the Claimant has incurred in connection with its response to the motion.105\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in accordance with relevant investment treaty case law, \"it is necessary to order Tennant to disclose the existence and terms of any third-party funding agreement it entered into to finance its claim in this arbitration.\"106 Referring to the cases of *Garc\u00eda Armas v. Venezuela* and *Muhammet Cap v. Turkmenistan,* the Respondent points out that the tribunals in those cases ordered the claimants to reveal the nature of their third-party funding arrangement, based on, *inter alia,* the tribunal's duty to protect the integrity of the arbitral proceedings,107 the principle of transparency,108 and the relevance of such information in evaluating requests for security for costs.109 In the present case, the Respondent submits, the same reasons apply to justify an order for disclosure of such information, in addition to the need to identify potential conflicts of interest.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 41.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 41, *referring to Muhammet \u00c7ap and Sehil \u0130n\u015faat Endustri ve Ticaret Ltd.

The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Tribunal should reject the Respondent's motion for third-party funding disclosure because the source of its funding \"is irrelevant to the issues in dispute.\"117\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 59.\n\n101.\n\nIn relation to the Respondent's concerns regarding possible conflicts of interest, the Claimant asserts that, at the Tribunal's request, it would be willing to disclose the identity of any funder exclusively to the Tribunal in order that it may \"determine whether any conflict of interest exists and, if necessary, make any necessary disclosures to the parties.\"118 The Claimant maintains that it is not, however, willing to disclose this information to the Respondent. In the Claimant's view, the Respondent's true motive for requesting this information is not to identify potential conflicts of interest but rather \"to know the financial condition of the funder itself so they know what they can go after.\"119\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 60, *referring to* ICCA-Queen Mary Taskforce, *Report on Third-Party Funding*, Chapter 4, \u00b6 A.1, April 2018 (**CLA-065**); Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 38:11-39:8.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 38:15-21.\n\n102.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's concern regarding the level of financial interest a potential funder might have in the outcome of this proceeding is unwarranted because any such interest would not alter the fact that the Claimant \"is the party at interest in this proceeding and has demonstrated that it is the owner of the investment that Canada treated unlawfully.\"120\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 61; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 46:4-10.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimant also considers Respondent's request to disclose the terms of any third-party funding agreement to be unwarranted. In the Claimant's view, such agreements are confidential and often contain proprietary information, and accordingly, their disclosure may be required only in \"exceptional circumstances, where the precise terms of that agreement are relevant.\"121 However, such exceptional circumstances are absent in this case, and therefore the terms of any third-party funding agreement should remain confidential.122\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 62; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 40:14-41:5, 42:7-23.\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 63, *referring to South American Silver Limited v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2013-15 (\"*South American Silver v. Bolivia*\"), Procedural Order No. 10, 11 January 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 79-81 (**RLA-013**).\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Decision**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it has the authority to order the disclosure requested if doing so would preserve the integrity of the arbitral process. The Claimant does not appear to dispute this.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant has also stated that it is willing to disclose the identity of any third-party funder to the Tribunal to address any concerns about a conflict of interest.123\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 60; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 49:14-17.\n\n106.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 submissions on this issue, the Tribunal has decided that the Claimant should make the following disclosures to the Tribunal and the Respondent by **Thursday, 12 March 2020** :\n\n(a) the identity of any third-party funder;\n\n(b) any terms contained in the third-party funding arrangement relating to the payment of adverse costs orders against the Claimant in this arbitration. Any such terms should be quoted in full in the Claimant\u2019s disclosure; and\n\n(c) where no such terms set out at (b) above exist, the Claimant is to inform the Tribunal and the Respondent of that fact.\n\n107.\n\nWhere any of the following changes are made to the third-party funding arrangement in the course of this arbitration, the Claimant is to notify the Tribunal and the Respondent of the same within two weeks from the date of change:\n\n(a) any change to the identity of the third-party funder, including termination of the third-party funding arrangement; or\n\n(b) any change to the terms relating to the payment of adverse costs orders against the Claimant in this arbitration.\n\n108.\n\nAny such disclosures by the Claimant to the Tribunal and the Respondent as set out at paragraphs 106 and 107 above shall be designated \"Confidential Information\" in accordance with the Confidentiality Order dated 24 June 2019. For the avoidance of doubt, these disclosures need not be made available to the general public.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s decision is based on the following factors. First, the existence of third-party funding agreements can be relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of applications for security for costs.124 The Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not denied that there is a third-party funder for its claims in this arbitration. It would have been easy for the Claimant to do so if there was no such funder.\n\n*See e.g.*, *Garc\u00eda Armas v. Venezuela* (revised **RLA-006**).\n\n110.\n\nSecondly, and in any event, the Tribunal considers that transparency as to the existence of a third-party funder is important to determine whether any conflict of interest exists.\n\n111.\n\nHaving ordered that the Claimant make the disclosures as set out at paragraphs 106 and 107 above, the Tribunal now turns to consider the Respondent\u2019s motion for security for costs.\n\n**D. RESPONDENT\u2019S MOTION FOR SECURITY FOR COSTS**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted a motion requesting that the Tribunal order the Claimant to issue security for costs in the amount of 6,934,001.95 CAD, by depositing the security into an escrow account arranged by the PCA within 90 days of the order, or the arbitral proceedings will be discontinued.125\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 46.\n\n113.\n\nIn the alternative, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimant to issue \"(i) security for costs for the procedural and jurisdictional phase of the proceedings, at this stage [(*i.e.* 1,477,098.91 CAD)]; and (ii) security for costs for the remaining phases of the arbitration (5,456,903.04 CAD) at a later date in its decision on the request for bifurcation or its decision on jurisdiction, should the arbitration proceed to merits and damages.\"126\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 40.\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal reject the Respondent's motion for security for costs and order the Respondent to reimburse the Claimant the costs incurred in connection with the Claimant's response to the said motion.127\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\n**1. Preliminary Matters**\n--------------------------\n\n***(a) The Tribunal's Authority to Order Security for Costs***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether the Tribunal has the authority to issue an order for security for cost under the NAFTA and the UNCITRAL Rules.128\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 10-13; Response to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 3-23.\n\n*i. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Tribunal possesses such authority under Article 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.129 According to the Respondent, Article 26(1), the purpose of which is to protect the integrity of the arbitral proceedings, \"grants the Tribunal a wide measure of discretion to order interim measures, including security for costs\".130 In addition, in the Respondent's view, the amendments to the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules \"do not detract in any way from the authority granted by the 1976 Rules to order Security for Costs\" because they \"simply make explicit powers that were implicit\" under Article 26(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.131\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 10-13; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 228:12-229:15.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 10-13, *referring to* Jan Paulsson & Georgios Petrochilos, *Revision of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules* (2006), \u00b6 206 (**RLA-008**); *Garc\u00eda Armas v.

Venezuela* case;133 and (ii) the claimant\u2019s impecuniosity and record of non-compliance with costs orders, and the existence of a third-party funding agreement, as in the *RSM v. Saint Lucia* case governed by the ICSID Convention.134\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 10; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 229:13-25.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 11, *referring to Garc\u00eda Armas v.

Saint Lucia*, \u00b6 86 (**RLA-019**).\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent adds that *Invesmart v. Czech Republic* is the only public case in which a tribunal has addressed a security for costs application solely under the UNCITRAL Rules. In that case, the Respondent stresses that while the tribunal found that it did not have the power to order security for costs under the UNCITRAL Rules, \"there are no public details from the Procedural Order in that case explaining why the Tribunal thought that it lacked [such authority]\".135\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 230:17-21.\n\n119.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal may exercise its authority under Article 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules because it is not modified by Article 1134 of the NAFTA in relation to this motion. In this respect, the Respondent maintains that none of the provisions of Section B, including Article 1134 of the NAFTA, modify the Tribunal\u2019s authority under Article 26(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.136\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\n120.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent submits that Article 1134 of the NAFTA authorises tribunals to order interim measures to preserve and protect both existing and contingent rights, such as a favourable costs order.137 In support of this interpretation, the Respondent points out that Article 1134 includes, as examples of interim measures, orders to preserve evidence, which can be made to protect contingent rights on the future production of evidence.138\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 231:17-25.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 232:2-7.\n\n121.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent contends that \"the basic rules of treaty interpretation require the Tribunal to take into account the unanimous agreement of the NAFTA Parties on the proper interpretation of Article 1134\", namely that NAFTA tribunals have authority to order security for costs, subject to applicable arbitration rules, and \"to accord the NAFTA Parties\u2019 interpretation considerable weight because it is consistent with the relevant context.\"139\n\nRespondent's Response to the non-Disputing Parties' Submissions, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 233:9-234:8.\n\n122.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent contends that \"[w]here the NAFTA Parties express concordant views on how to interpret NAFTA, they create subsequent agreement and subsequent practice within the meaning of VCLT Article 31.3.\"140 For this reason, NAFTA tribunals have accorded considerable weight to the concordant views of NAFTA Parties, expressed through their submissions to investor-State tribunals, including non-disputing Party submissions.141\n\nRespondent's Response to the non-Disputing Parties' Submissions, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\nRespondent's Response to the non-Disputing Parties' Submissions, \u00b6 5, *referring to* *Canadian Cattlemen for Fair Trade v.

The Claimant's Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n123.\n\nIn contrast, the Claimant submits that neither the NAFTA nor the UNCITRAL Rules authorize the Tribunal to order security for costs.142\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 3-23.\n\n124.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, an order for security for costs \"is not an interim measure envisaged by the drafters of NAFTA Article 1134\",143 which limits the interim measures a tribunal may order to those that preserve a right or ensure the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective. This is because, the Claimant argues, \"no party has a right to a costs award\",144 and the issue of security for costs has no bearing on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.145\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 3-9.\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 7, *referring to* C.

In the Claimant's view, \"an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party\", as referenced in Article 1134, protects \"immediate and definite\" rights by protecting the integrity of the arbitration process and prevent the aggravation of the dispute.151 The right to request the production of documents, the Claimant argues, is also confirmed in Article 24(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and corroborated by Article 26 which authorizes the Tribunal to order interim measures for document production.152\n\nClaimant's Response to the non-Disputing Parties' Submissions, \u00b6 49.\n\nClaimant's Response to the non-Disputing Parties' Submissions, \u00b6 48.\n\n128.\n\nIn light of the above, the Claimant considers that the NAFTA Parties' reading of Article 1134 would be tantamount to an amendment to the provision, which can only be done under NAFTA Article 2202(2) and approved in accordance with the \"applicable legal procedures of each Party\",153 and not simply through subsequent practice or agreement.154\n\nClaimant's Response to the non-Disputing Parties' Submissions, \u00b6\u00b6 38-40.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 279:18-25.\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the UNCITRAL Rules do not empower the Tribunal to order security for costs because there is no provision therein which explicitly addresses such an interim measure.155 In the Claimant's view, the Tribunal's authority under Article 26(1) does not encompass measures that are not related to the subject-matter of the dispute, including orders for security for costs, which are procedural in nature.156 Indeed, the Claimant considers that Article 26(2), which authorizes a tribunal to order security for the costs of interim measures, supports the position that Article 26(1) only authorizes tribunals to grant interim measures that have as an object concrete rights or property in dispute \"and not a hypothetical final cost award.\"157\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 11.\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13, *referring to* Court of Appeal for Ontario, *Inforica Inc. v.

Mongolia* and *South American Silver v. Bolivia* are not relevant precedents, as the former did not address its power to award security for costs and the latter was governed by the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules.161 Additionally, according to the Claimant, the *Garcia Armas v. Venezuela* case is \"inapposite\" because in that case, the parties did not contest the tribunal\u2019s authority to order interim measures and the application was made both under the UNCITRAL Rules and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.162\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 20 *referring to* Articles 47 and 39 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23.\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 22 *referring to Garc\u00eda Armas v.

Venezuela,* which was governed by the UNCITRAL Rules.163 The test, which was drawn from Article 26(3) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules and which the tribunal considered to reflect the international consensus, comprised the following elements (i) whether there is, *prima facie*, a reasonable prospect that the Tribunal will issue an award in favour of the Respondent, including its costs of legal representation; (ii) whether harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages may be caused if the measure is not ordered; (iii) whether such harm would substantially outweigh the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and (iv) whether the measure requested is of such urgency that it cannot be postponed until the issuance of the award.164\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 16-19.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 16, *referring to Garc\u00eda Armas v.

Venezuela* and *RSM v. Saint Lucia* - the only two tribunals that have ordered security for costs - relied on the \"exceptional circumstances\" standard to justify their decision.171\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 286:16-287:1.\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 26, *referring to Garc\u00eda Armas v.

The Respondent\u2019s Request for Security for Costs**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) The Respondent's Position***\n-----------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that its Request for Security for Costs satisfies the applicable legal standard.172 In relation to the first limb of the *Garc\u00eda Armas v. Venezuela* test, the Respondent submits that it has a *prima facie* reasonable possibility of prevailing in this case.173 On jurisdiction, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant\u2019s claim is manifestly time-barred, reiterating its arguments of its objection under Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA.174 Furthermore, the Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s \"allegations regarding spoliation of documents do not even relate to the Claimant or its project, as required by NAFTA Article 1101(1).\"175 With respect to the merits, the Respondent submits that since the tribunal in *Mesa Power v. Canada* has already dismissed claims that are \"substantially no different\" from the Claimant\u2019s claim, the Claimant\u2019s claims should be deemed frivolous.176\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 24; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 285:22-289:4.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 26, *referring to* Statement of Defence, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 28-39; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 243:22-245:2.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 26.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 27. The Respondent underlines that the wording in the notice of arbitration in *Mesa Power v. Canada* and the one in this case overlaps significantly (Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 27, Annex III).\n\n137.\n\nConcerning the second limb of the test, the Respondent submits that it could suffer harm not adequately reparable by a costs order if security for costs is not provided.177 The Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s \"corporate history leading up to the present indicates that it is impecunious and has been unsuccessful in many previous business ventures.\"178 The Respondent notes that based on its \"diligent investigation\" and \"extensive research\", \"[i]t seems\" that the Claimant \"no longer operates\", \"has no website[, no] publicly identifiable business establishment[,] no apparent source of revenues from any business activities [and] [n]o public information indicates that it holds financial assets.\"179 In addition, the Respondent points out that the Claimant appears to have a third-party funder \"which this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to compel payment of an Adverse Costs Order and who may have no responsibility to pay one.\"180\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 28-31.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 30, *referring to* Tennant Consulting, LLC, Limited Liability Company Articles of Organization, 10 September 2001 (**R-008**); Wine Destinations, LLC, Limited Liability Company Restated Articles of Organization, 5 March 2002 (**R-009**); Tennant Travel Services, LLC, Limited Liability Company Restated Articles of Organization, 27 November 2002 (**R-010**); Tennant Energy, LLC, Amendment to Articles of Organization of a Limited Liability Company, 20 April 2015, (**R-011**).\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 30; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 248:6-13.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 226:23-227:1, 248:2-6.\n\n138.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Respondent considers that it has established a reasonable basis to find that the Claimant is impecunious, and that accordingly, the burden is now on the Claimant to \"produce evidence sufficient to prove it can pay an adverse costs order.\"181 Yet, the Respondent observes that beyond stating that it has \"limited assets beyond the Arbitration,\" the Claimant has thus far not provided any evidence to prove that it has the capability to pay an adverse costs order.182\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 31, *referring to Garc\u00eda Armas v. Venezuela,* \u00b6\u00b6 7, 224, 226, 250 (revised **RLA-006**).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 257:19-258:10.\n\n139.\n\nAccordingly, because the Claimant has failed to meet this burden, the Tribunal must order it to issue security for costs.183 Otherwise, the Respondent argues, it would be left in the same position as in *Mesa Power v. Canada*, where despite having been awarded part of its costs in the final award, Canada is still \"spending significant funds trying to enforce [this order], without any alternative options.\"184\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 31, *referring to Garc\u00eda Armas v.

Canada*, adjusted in respect of the jurisdictional phase in light of the additional procedural steps envisioned in the procedural calendar of this arbitration.190 According to the Respondent, this calculation is reasonable, as it has asserted before, the Claimant's claims \"virtually replicates\" Mesa Power's claims.191\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 37-40; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 270:10-271:5.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39, Annexes I and II, *referring to Mesa Power v.

Canada.*197\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 35, *referring to* *Mesa Power v. Canada*, Award, 24 March 2016, \u00b6 704 (**RLA-001**), Dissenting Opinion of Judge Charles N.

Venezuela*, *South American Silver v. Bolivia* and *Orlandini v. Bolivia*, have considered that when evaluating a request for security for costs, tribunals should avoid prejudging on the merits of the dispute.198 Moreover, the Claimant emphasises that the tribunal in *Maffezini v. Spain* determined that upholding a request for security for costs on the basis that a respondent will hypothetically obtain a favourable costs order, entails prejudging on the merits of the dispute.199 Relying on the foregoing, the Claimant states that at this stage of the proceedings, where jurisdictional and merits issues are still disputed and where the Claimant \"continues to await information related to these disputed jurisdictional and merits issues,\" \"assessing the likelihood of the respondent state\u2019s success would be premature.\"200\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39, *referring to Garc\u00eda Armas v.

Albania* and *RSM v. Saint Lucia,* have held that mere financial difficulties or lack of assets on the part of a claimant do not constitute a sufficient basis for an order for security for costs.203 Any decision contrary to this view, according to the Claimant, \"would frustrate investor\u2019s access to justice.\"204\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 47-48, *referring to Burimi S.R.L. and Eagle Games SH.A v.

Slovak Republic* and *Orlandini v. Bolivia*, the Claimant alleges that orders for security for costs should be warranted only in exceptional circumstances, such as when a claimant has a record of non-payment of costs awards or there is evidence showing a claimant\u2019s bad faith or improper behaviour in the proceedings at stake.205 In the present case, the Claimant submits that the Respondent \"has been unable to identify any exceptional circumstances of the kind found by previous tribunals as justification for an order for security for costs.\"206\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51, *referring to* *EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. v.

Bolivia*, \u00b6\u00b6 143-144 (**RLA-034**).\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 52.\n\n150.\n\nReferring to various ICSID tribunals that have considered requests for security for costs, the Claimant points out that they have held that there was insufficient risk to grant such requests even where the claimant lacked assets.207 Similarly, as in this case, where the claimant lacked a history of defaulting on its financial obligations, tribunals have found that there was no real risk to justify an award for security for costs, or requirement for the claimant to demonstrate its solvency.\n\nClaimant's Response to the non-Disputing Parties' Submissions, \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59, 61.\n\n151.\n\nThird, the Claimant submits that, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertion, the harm the Respondent may suffer would not outweigh the Claimant\u2019s harm in the event that the Tribunal ordered security for costs.208 The Claimant argues *inter alia* that the amount requested by the Respondent is \"speculative and grossly excessive,\" because it assumes that the Respondent will be awarded 100% of its costs when in *Mesa Power v. Canada,* the case the Respondent uses as a basis to calculate the amount it requests, the tribunal awarded Canada only 30% of its costs.209 On the other hand, the Claimant contends that harm it will suffer if it is required to issue security for costs is tangible and may even \"hinder it from being able to proceed with the arbitration\" as it has limited assets that are unconnected to this dispute.210\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 54(c); Claimant's Response to the non-Disputing Parties' Submissions, \u00b6 60(c).\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 54(b); Claimant's Response to the non-Disputing Parties' Submissions, \u00b6 60.\n\n152.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that its motion for security for costs is of an urgent character.211 The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's position that its ongoing costs related to these proceedings justify the urgency of its request.212 In the Claimant's view, given that the Respondent's counsel are government employees with a fixed salary, the Respondent's costs of legal representation are not related to this claim and will still be borne in any event.213\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n\n**3. Non-Disputing Parties' Submissions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nBoth the U.S. and Mexico made submissions on the interpretation of Article 1134 of the NAFTA, and in particular on the question whether the tribunals' authority thereunder to grant interim measures of protection includes the authority to grant orders for security for costs. The following sub-sections summarize each of the non-disputing Parties' arguments in this respect.\n\n***(a) The United States' Submission***\n---------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe U.S. submits that an order for security for costs \"may constitute 'an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party'\" under Article 1134 of the NAFTA, and that such an order is not barred by the second sentence of that Article.214\n\nU.S.' Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 7.\n\n155.\n\nAccording to the US, Article 1134 \"makes no distinction between interim measures that protect contingent rights and measures that protect existing rights.\"215 The phrase \"rights of a disputing party\" is not qualified in any way,216 and the express example of an interim measure provided in Article 1134\u2014an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party\u2014preserves a right to disclosure of evidence that is contingent on the tribunal's authority to order such disclosure, and its determination that such an order is appropriate.217\n\nU.S.' Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\nU.S.' Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\nU.S.' Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\n156.\n\nWhile no tribunal appears to have ruled on requests for security for costs under NAFTA Article 1134, the U.S. also points out that several tribunals have found that similar language under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention allows for provisional measures that preserve contingent rights, including orders granting a party security for its costs.218\n\nU.S.' Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 6, *citing* *RSM et al. v. Grenada*, \u00b6\u00b6 5.6, 5.8 (**RLA-018**)*.*\n\n157.\n\nThus, the U.S. submits that a tribunal constituted under Chapter 11 of the NAFTA may issue an order for security for costs under Article 1134 in appropriate circumstances and, if so, authorized by the applicable arbitration rules.219\n\nU.S.' Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 7.\n\n158.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. contends that when the three NAFTA Parties demonstrate an agreement on the proper interpretation of a provision, as they have done with respect to Article 1134 in this case, the Tribunal must take this into account, in accordance with the principles on subsequent agreement and practice as outlined in Article 31 of the VCLT.220\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 345:4-8, 346:25-347:9.\n\n***(b) The United Mexican States' Submission***\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nMexico submits that \"[i]n general, NAFTA Article 1134 provides a margin of discretion for a Tribunal to order an interim measure of protection 'to preserve the rights of a disputing party' which allows the possibility for a Tribunal to order security for costs, provided that other relevant requirements contained in the applicable arbitration rules are met.\"221\n\nMexico's Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 6.\n\n160.\n\nThis is because, Mexico argues, the first sentence of Article 1134 authorizes various types of interim measures of protection, and therefore does not limit the Tribunal's authority to order security for costs simply because such an order is not expressly referenced therein.222 In addition, the two limitations to the power of NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals to order interim measures of protection, as laid out in the second sentence of Article 1134, also do not cover security for costs.223\n\nMexico's Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\nMexico's Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\n**4. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Decision**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, following the conclusion of the Hearing, but before the making of this Order, the Respondent drew to the Tribunal's, and the Claimant's, attention, the publication of the Decision on the Respondent's Request for Security for Costs and the Claimant's Request for Security for Claim, dated 27 January 2020, handed down by the ICSID tribunal in the case *Dirk Herzig v. Turkmenistan*.224 Having afforded the Parties an opportunity to make submissions on this decision, the decision was admitted into the record of these proceedings and has been carefully weighed by the Tribunal for purposes of its present Order.\n\n*Dirk Herzig as Insolvency Administrator over the Assets of Unionmatex Industrieanlagen GmbH v. Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/35 (\"*Dirk Herzig v. Turkmenistan*\"), Decision on the Respondent's Request for Security for Costs and the Claimant's Request for Security for Claim, 27 January 2020 (**RLA-112**).\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal's authority to order interim measures is governed by Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which provides as follows:\n\n1. At the request of either party, the arbitral tribunal may take any interim measures it deems necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute, including measures for the conservation of the goods forming the subject-matter of the dispute, such as ordering their deposit with a third person or the sale of perishable goods.\n\n2. Such interim measures may be established in the form of an interim award. The arbitral tribunal shall be entitled to require security for the costs of such measures.\n\n3. A request for interim measures addressed by any party to a judicial authority shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate, or as a waiver of that agreement.\n\n163.\n\nPursuant to Article 1120(2) of the NAFTA, Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules shall govern this arbitration except to the extent modified by Section B of NAFTA Chapter 11, which includes Article 1134.\n\n164.\n\nArticle 1134 of the NAFTA in turn provides that:\n\nA Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. A Tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of the measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 1116 or 1117. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.\n\n165.\n\nHaving carefully considered the Parties\u2019 and the non-disputing Parties\u2019 submissions on this issue, the Tribunal is of the view that it has authority to order security for costs in this arbitration.\n\n166.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that the investment tribunals in *Pugachev v Russia*225 and *Garcia Armas v Venezuela*226 have both affirmed their authority to order security for costs under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Whilst the parties in *Pugachev v Russia* did not contest the issue on the Tribunal\u2019s power to grant requests for security for costs, the tribunal in that case nonetheless independently examined whether it has the power to do so. The Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Pugachev v Russia* that Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules does not set forth a limit on the types of provisional measures that this Tribunal may take. In fact, Article 26(2) expressly provides that UNCITRAL tribunals are entitled to require \"security for the costs\" of interim measures, which suggests that UNCITRAL tribunals do have power to request a party to provide security for costs. The Tribunal is fortified in its conclusion by the fact that in the context of investment arbitration, several arbitral tribunals have expressly confirmed that arbitral tribunals do have the power to grant requests for security for costs.\n\n*Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev v Russia* (UNCITRAL) Interim Award, 7 July 2017 (**RLA-032**).\n\n*Garc\u00eda Armas v. Venezuela* (revised **RLA-006**).\n\n167.\n\nThe Claimant argues that because the drafters of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules revised Article 26 to remove the requirement that interim measures be \"in relation to the subject-matter of the dispute\" and included new language specifically authorising interim measures which provide a means of \"preserving assets out of which a subsequent award may be satisfied\", this suggests that the pre-amendment language does not empower tribunals to order a party to pay security for costs.227 The Tribunal is unable to agree. It may well be that the amendments, as the Respondent submits, make explicit powers that were implicit in Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules. This conclusion is supported by the Report commissioned by the UNCITRAL Secretariat on revisions of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, which explained that the amendments are merely \"*clarifications* that practice has shown are necessary or at least highly desirable\", and that these amendments would \"*maintain* the basic structure and *content* of the existing article 26\" (emphasis added). The reference to the \"subject-matter\" in Article 26(1) was also expressly characterised in the report as \"facially restrictive phraseology\".228\n\nResponse to the Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.\n\nJan Paulsson & Georgios Petrochilos, *Revision of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules*, (2006), \u00b6 206 (**RLA-008**).\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal is also unable to agree with the Claimant's argument that NAFTA Article 1134 limits the measures that this Tribunal may order to those that preserve an existing right, with the result that this Tribunal has no power to order security for costs as a party's \"right\" to a costs award hinges on the hypothetical.229 Article 1134 permits the Tribunal to order measures of protection \"to preserve the rights of a disputing party\". It does not make any distinction between interim measures that protect contingent rights and measures that protect existing rights. The only types of interim measures that the Article expressly bars a tribunal from ordering are (i) attachment orders, and (ii) orders that enjoin the application of the challenged measure, none of which restricts the Tribunal from ordering security for costs.\n\nClaimant's Response to the non-Disputing Parties' Submissions, \u00b6 10.\n\n169.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that many tribunals have confirmed that the hypothetical nature of a costs award is not a bar to ordering provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which like NAFTA Article 1134, similarly permits a tribunal to recommend provisional measures \"to preserve the respective rights of either party\". In any case, it makes no sense to the Tribunal to construe the rights that are being preserved under NAFTA Article 1134 as being limited to \"existing\" rights. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the reasoning in *RSM v. Saint Lucia* that \"the hypothetical element of the right at issue is one of the inherent characteristics of the regime of provisional measures\".230\n\n*RSM v. Saint Lucia*, \u00b6 72 (**RLA-019**).\n\n170.\n\nIn addition, neither party has addressed the Tribunal on whether it was necessary to establish that the Tribunal had *prima facie* jurisdiction before it could grant security for costs.\n\n171.\n\nIn the premises, the Tribunal is satisfied that it has the power under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules to order security for costs in this arbitration. The Tribunal now turns to consider the legal standard to grant security for costs.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the parties largely agree that the four factors set out in *Garcia Armas v. Venezuela* would apply.231 These factors are:\n\n(a) *prima facie*, there is a reasonable possibility that the respondent would prevail in the case;\n\n(b) the respondent would likely suffer harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages without the order;\n\n(c) the respondent's potential harm without the order substantially outweighs the harm that the claimant would likely incur from the order; and\n\n(d) the condition of urgency is met.\n\n*Garc\u00eda Armas v. Venezuela*, \u00b6 191 (revised **RLA-006**).\n\n173.\n\nThe disagreement between the Parties, it would appear, is whether a security for cost order may be only obtained in \"exceptional circumstances\". The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the Respondent would have to show \"exceptional circumstances\". In considering requests for security for costs, investment arbitration tribunals have emphasised that this power may only be exercised where there are \"exceptional circumstances\". The Respondent has not been able to cite a single case where the standard \"exceptional circumstances\" was *not* applied. This is not surprising, given that security for costs orders raise specific access to justice issues that do not arise with other forms of provisional relief.\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in *Orlandini v Bolivia*232 that such exceptional circumstances would include, for instance (i) a claimant's track record of non-payment of costs awards in prior proceedings; (ii) a claimant's improper behaviour in the proceedings at issue, such as conduct that interferes with the efficient and orderly conduct of the proceedings; (iii) evidence of a claimant moving or hiding assets to avoid any potential exposure to a costs award; or (iv) other evidence of a claimant's bad faith or improper behaviour.\n\n*Orlandini v. Bolivia*, \u00b6 143 (**RLA-034**). *See also* ICCA-Queen Mary Taskforce, *Report on Third-Party Funding*, p. 174, April 2018 (**CLA-065**).\n\n175.\n\nIn *RSM v. Saint Lucia* for example, the *RSM* tribunal took into account that the claimant was impecunious and was funded by a third-party that could presumably not be made responsible for any adverse costs award in reaching its decision to order security. However, the decisive factor for the tribunal to grant the requested security for costs was the fact that the claimant had a proven history of not complying with costs awards rendered against it.233\n\n*RSM v. Saint Lucia*, \u00b6 86 (**RLA-019**).\n\n176.\n\nSimilarly, in *EuroGas v. Slovak Republic,*234 the tribunal refused to make an order for security for costs as the respondent had failed to establish that the claimants had defaulted on their payment obligations in the proceedings or in other arbitration proceedings. The tribunal made clear in that case that \"financial difficulties and third-party funding - which has become a common practice - do not necessarily constitute per se exceptional circumstances justifying that the Respondent be granted an order of security for costs\".\n\n*EuroGas v. Slovak Republic*, \u00b6 123 (**CLA-067**).\n\n177.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent has met the burden of proving exceptional circumstances.\n\n178.\n\nFirst, the Respondent has not discharged its initial burden of establishing a reasonable basis that the Claimant is impecunious such that the burden then shifts to the Claimant to produce evidence of its ability to meet a costs award. All that the Respondent has shown is that there is no public information which indicates that the Claimant holds financial assets. It is not the case that there is something which suggests that the Claimant does not hold financial assets. Instead, the Respondent simply lacks evidence about the asset position of the Claimant.235 That is not sufficient for the Respondent to discharge its initial burden. Given this lack of evidence, the Tribunal is not therefore persuaded of the Respondent's case that it is at risk of serious or irreparable harm.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 248:16-249:19; Motion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 30.\n\n179.\n\nSecondly, the existence of a funding agreement alone has not been found by arbitral tribunals to be sufficient to grant security for costs. As explained by the tribunal in *South American Silver v. Bolivia*,236 if \"the existence of these third-parties alone, without considering other factors, becomes determinative on granting or rejecting a request for security for costs, respondents could request and obtain the security on a systematic basis, increasing the risk of blocking potentially legitimate claims\". On this issue, the Tribunal notes the recent decision in *Dirk Herzig v. Turkmenistan*, which turned, *inter alia*, on the issue of \"the explicit non-liability of the third-party funder for a costs award adverse to its funded party\".237\n\n*South American Silver v. Bolivia*, \u00b6 77 (**RLA-013**).\n\n*Dirk Herzig v. Turkmenistan*, \u00b6 57 (**RLA-112**).\n\n180.\n\nIn illustrating the \"irreparable harm\" that the Respondent will suffer without an order for security in the present case, the Respondent points to Mesa\u2019s failure to comply with a $3 million costs order in *Mesa Power v. Canada*.238 However, this is irrelevant as the Claimant was not a party in that arbitration, which involved a different party, Mesa. To the extent that the Respondent suggests that the Claimant is controlled by Mesa because the present arbitration is *inter alia* a duplicative claim of that in *Mesa Power v. Canada*,239 the Tribunal cannot decide one way or another until it has seen the Parties\u2019 pleadings which have yet to be filed. The fact that Mesa has failed to comply with a $3 million costs order will not advance the Respondent\u2019s case at this stage.\n\nMotion for Security for Costs, \u00b6 29.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 74:9-14.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s motion for security for costs is therefore dismissed. For the avoidance of the doubt, however, the dismissal does not preclude the Respondent from re-applying for security costs if there is a change in circumstances or if there is new evidence which suggests that the Claimant may not, or may not be able to, comply with an adverse costs order.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the principle that parties in proceedings like these under NAFTA Chapter 11 and under the UNCITRAL Rules have an obligation to comply with orders and awards, including those relating to costs. The Tribunal has not found anything to indicate that the Claimant will not comply with costs orders and the presumption must be that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, a party will act in good faith.\n\n**IV. DISPOSITIF**\n------------------\n\n183.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides to:\n\n(a) REJECT the Claimant\u2019s request for interim measures.\n\n(b) REJECT the Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation as premature, and directs that modifications in accordance with paragraph 93 above be made to the procedural timetable set out at PO 1 for the scenario where the proceedings are *not* bifurcated.\n\n(c) ORDER the Claimant to make the disclosures set out at paragraphs 106 and 107.\n\n(d) REJECT the Respondent's motion for security for costs.\n\n184.\n\nThe issue of costs of the above applications is to be reserved to be decided at a later stage."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 8 (Request for Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2020-11-12T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 8 (Request for Bifurcation)\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration dated 1 June 2017, the Claimant commenced this arbitration against the Respondent pursuant to Articles 1116 and 1120 of Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\"), and the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 1976 (\"**UNCITRAL Rules**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 24 June 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO 1**\") establishing the procedural calendar for an initial phase up to the Tribunal's decision on bifurcation and preliminary motions, and two alternative timetables for a subsequent phase applicable (i) should the proceedings not be bifurcated; and (ii) should the proceedings be bifurcated.\n\n3.\n\nOn 2 July 2019, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence.\n\n4.\n\nOn 23 September 2019, the Respondent submitted its Request for Bifurcation, requesting that the Tribunal address in a preliminary procedure the Respondent's NAFTA Article 1116(2) time-bar jurisdictional objection.\n\n5.\n\nOn 23 October 2019, the Claimant submitted its Response to the Request for Bifurcation.\n\n6.\n\nFrom 14 to 15 January 2020, a hearing on the issues of bifurcation and preliminary motions took place in Washington, D.C.\n\n7.\n\nOn 27 February 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"**PO 4**\"), in which it dismissed the Respondent's request for bifurcation on the ground that it was premature. The Tribunal held, in relevant part:\n\n87. In the exercise of its discretion to bifurcate, the Tribunal is guided by three relevant considerations. These considerations are (i) whether the jurisdictional objection is frivolous; (ii) whether the objection, if successful, would materially reduce the time and costs of the proceeding; and (iii) whether the objection concerns issues intertwined with the merits of the arbitration.\n\n88. Having considered the Parties' submissions on this issue, the Tribunal has decided to dismiss the Respondent's request for bifurcation on the ground that it is premature.\n\n89. The Tribunal has been directed to paragraph 91 of the Claimant's Notice of Arbitration dated 1 June 2017 (\"NOA\").102 Paragraph 91 of the NOA refers to \"four categories of wrongful actions\" purportedly committed by the Respondent, namely (i) the unfair manipulation of the award of access to the electricity transmission grid; (ii) the unfair manipulation of the dissemination of the FIT Program information; (iii) the unfair manipulation of the awarding of the FIT Program Contracts; and (iv) the improper destruction of necessary and material evidence by senior officials in the Government of Ontario. However, the NOA simply does not contain sufficient particulars of each category of wrongdoing which would allow the Tribunal to take a view, one way or another, on whether the Tribunal can determine the Respondent's jurisdictional objection without entering into the merits.\n\n90. The Respondent has requested that the Tribunal bifurcate the proceedings to consider the Respondent's jurisdictional objection that the Claimant allegedly failed to meet the conditions precedent for submitting a claim to arbitration pursuant to Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA. According to the Respondent, the NOA was filed more than three years after the Claimant first acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that it incurred loss or damage as a result of that breach and as such, the claim is time-barred.\n\n91. Before the Tribunal can make an assessment of whether to bifurcate the proceedings, the Tribunal will need to know what evidence it will likely have to consider in determining the Respondent's jurisdictional objection and whether the Tribunal will be substantially engaging in the facts of the dispute when considering that evidence. However, until the Tribunal is informed of the specific breach in question which the Respondent now contends is time-barred, the Tribunal does not know what evidence will likely be adduced or the evidence it will likely have to consider in assessing when the Claimant acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of that breach. Consequently, the Tribunal is unable to decide at this stage whether an inquiry into the Respondent's jurisdictional objection will be best conducted with the merits phase when the Tribunal will have the benefit of the entire record or whether the jurisdictional objection should be heard as a preliminary issue. The Tribunal needs to see the Claimant's claims in more detail before it can decide whether the proceedings can be bifurcated. The Tribunal cannot decide whether to bifurcate the proceedings or not if there is no specificity to the claims. For these reasons, the Respondent's request for bifurcation is premature.1\n\nPO 4, \u00b6\u00b6 87-91, 183(b).\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal further determined that the proceedings would continue in accordance with the procedural timetable set out in PO 1 for the non-bifurcated scenario, with certain modifications adopted in order to allow the Respondent to pursue the bifurcation of the proceedings after having had sight of the Claimant's Memorial.2 In the event that the Respondent decided to renew its request for bifurcation, the Tribunal held that:\n\n(d) After receiving the [Parties'] submissions, the Tribunal will decide **on the papers without a hearing** on whether the proceedings should be bifurcated. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that it has had the benefit of extensive arguments by Parties on the issue of bifurcation and the oral arguments made at the Hearing in particular have been of assistance to the Tribunal. In the interests of expediency and to save time and costs for all Parties, the Tribunal is confident that it can address a second bifurcation request without a further hearing.\n\n(e) The Tribunal will issue the relevant procedural directions after it has come to a decision on the Respondent's second bifurcation request, including any adjustments to the procedural timetable where necessary.3\n\nPO 4, \u00b6\u00b6 92-93.\n\nPO 4, \u00b6\u00b6 93(d) and (e).\n\n9.\n\nOn 26 June 2020, the Parties advised the Tribunal that they agreed to extend certain deadlines set out in PO 4. On 4 July 2020, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties' agreement to amend the procedural schedule.\n\n10.\n\nOn 7 August 2020, the Claimant submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Quantum (the \"**Memorial**\"), along with the witness statement of Mr. John C. Pennie4 and the expert report on valuation by Richard Taylor and Larry Andrade of Deloitte.5\n\nFirst Witness Statement of John C. Pennie, dated 7 August 2020 (**CWS-1**).\n\nExpert Report on Valuation by Deloitte LLP, dated 7 August 2020 (**CER-1**).\n\n11.\n\nOn 21 September 2020, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction (the \"**Memorial on Jurisdiction**\") and, in a separate filing, its renewed request for bifurcation (the \"**Renewed Request for Bifurcation**\"), along with the witness statement of Mr. Lucas McCall.6\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Luca McCall, dated 21 September 2020 (**RWS-1**).\n\n12.\n\nOn 13 October 2020, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent's request for bifurcation (\"**Response to Renewed Bifurcation Request**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn 28 October 2020, the Respondent sought leave (i) to submit into the record as a new legal authority the *Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/20/3, Procedural Order No. 3, Decision on Bifurcation, dated 20 October 2020 (the \"*Westmoreland* Decision\"); and (ii) for both disputing Parties to file submissions on the relevance of the *Westmoreland* Decision to the Renewed Request for Bifurcation.\n\n14.\n\nOn 30 October 2020, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimant provided its response, stating that it \"opposes [the Respondent's request] based on practicality, delay, and cost.\" Further, should the Tribunal decide to admit the *Westmoreland* Decision into the record, the Claimant argued that a specific procedure should then follow, according to which both the disputing and non-disputing Parties would be given the opportunity to file submissions, and the disputing Parties would then be given the opportunity to respond to the non-disputing Parties' submissions.\n\n15.\n\nOn 10 November 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, prior to receipt of the Respondent's request, it had already decided on the course to be followed in connection with the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation. As such, it saw no need to depart from that decision for purposes of receiving further submissions from the Parties on the *Westmoreland* Decision. Taking account of the fact that the *Westmoreland* Decision is already in the public domain, the Tribunal nevertheless granted the Respondent permission to submit it into the record, without comment from the Parties.\n\n**II. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal bifurcate the proceedings and consider its two *ratione temporis* jurisdictional objections as preliminary questions.7\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 22.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent first advances that the Claimant has failed to establish that it was a protected \"investor of a Party\" when the alleged breaches occurred, and that therefore, it has not complied with the requirements of Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA.8 According to the Respondent, the exhibits accompanying the Claimant's Memorial show that the Claimant did not acquire an equity interest in the alleged investment, Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc. (\"**Skyway 127**\"), until 15 January 2015.9 This confirms, the Respondent asserts, that the Claimant was not a protected \"investor of a Party\" between 2008 and 2013 when the alleged breach occurred.10 In light of the former, the Respondent concludes that it has not consented to this arbitration, and therefore, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims.\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. *See also* Memorial on Jurisdiction, Part V.\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 11, *referring to* Shareholder's Ledger Skyway 127, 15 January 2015 (**C-115**).\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 11, *referring to* Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 771-774; Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 80-96.\n\n18.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's claims are time-barred under Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA.11 Article 1116(2) requires that claims be filed within three years from the date on which the enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage.12 The Respondent submits, however, that the Claimant knew, or should have known, about the alleged breaches more than three years before it submitted its claim to arbitration (*i.e.*, before 1 June 2014).13 This is because, the Respondent contends, most of the information on which the Claimant relies to substantiate its claims were available before the critical date of 1 June 2014, and the information that became available after that date was not, as the Claimant alleges, new.14\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. *See also* Memorial on Jurisdiction, Part VI.\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 3.\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 16. *See also* Memorial on Jurisdiction, Part VI.B.\n\n*See* Memorial on Jurisdiction, Part VI.B.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent considers that these two jurisdictional objections, considered either jointly or separately, warrant the bifurcation of the proceedings.15 In this regard, the Respondent recalls that Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules contains a presumption in favour of bifurcating jurisdictional questions \"which is intended to increase the fairness and efficiency of arbitration proceedings.\"16 The Respondent further recalls that in paragraph 87 of PO 4 the Tribunal relied on the three-pronged test for bifurcation as articulated in the *Glamis Gold* case, namely: (i) whether the jurisdictional objection is frivolous; (ii) whether the objection, if successful, would materially reduce the time and costs of the proceeding; and (iii) whether the objection concerns issues intertwined with the merits of the arbitration.17\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 5, *referring to* *Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn UK Holdings Limited (CUHL) v. Republic of India*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 4 - Decision on the Respondent Application for Bifurcation, 19 April 2017, \u00b6 78 (**RLA-056**); *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised), 31 May 2005, \u00b6 11 (**RLA-054**).\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 7, *referring to* PO 4, \u00b6 87.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent submits that all of the relevant criteria support bifurcation in the instant case.18 First, the Respondent asserts that its objections are not frivolous because they concern the Claimant's compliance with conditions precedent to Canada's consent to arbitration under Articles 1116(1) and 1116(2) of the NAFTA, and therefore \"go[] to the very basis of the Tribunal's authority to hear this claim.\"19 The Respondent also contends that since as a general rule under international law treaties do not apply retroactively absent express provisions to the contrary, its objection under Article 1116(1) \"raises a fundamental question concerning the non-retroactive application of the substantive obligations in NAFTA Chapter Eleven\".20\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, 17-20.\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 17-18.\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 12.\n\n21.\n\nSecond, the Respondent maintains that either of its objections, if granted, would materially reduce the time and costs of proceedings because it would dispose of the totality of the Claimant's claims and bring the arbitration to a close.21 Moreover, the Respondent notes, its objections may properly be considered by the Tribunal without the need for document production or expert reports.22\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19.\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19.\n\n22.\n\nThird, the Respondent submits that its objections do not concern issues intertwined with the merits of the arbitration.23 The Respondent maintains that in order to assess its objection under Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA the Tribunal only needs to address two questions: \"(i) when did the alleged breach occur; and (ii) when did the Claimant become an 'investor of a Party' with an investment in Skyway 127,\" none of which require delving into the merits of the Claimant's claims.24 Similarly, the Respondent asserts that the review of its objection under Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA would only involve identifying the measures that allegedly breached the NAFTA and the dates on which the Claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and resulting loss or damage.25\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 20.\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 14.\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 20.\n\n23.\n\nAs for the two other jurisdictional objections raised in its Statement of Defence dated 2 July 2019, the Respondent states that these objections, although not frivolous, may be more closely intertwined with the merits of the dispute. Accordingly, the Renewed Request for Bifurcation only addresses the Respondent's objections to the jurisdiction *ratione temporis* of the Tribunal, and is without prejudice to other jurisdictional objections to be made in future pleadings, if such pleadings are necessary.26\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 4.\n\n**B. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation \"should be denied in its entirety, and costs should be assessed against it on a full indemnity basis\".27\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 388.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant, like the Tribunal and the Respondent, refers to the three criteria under the *Glamis Gold* test for determining whether to bifurcate (*see* paragraphs 7 and 16 above).28 In addition, the Claimant contends that other case-dependent considerations should be taken into account. In the present case, this includes the fact that, in the Claimant's view, evidence regarding its spoliation of evidence claim will likely arise in the document production phase.29\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 141, *referring to* PO 4, \u00b6 87.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 143-145, *referring to* Jeffrey Commission and Rahim Moloo, *Procedural Issues in International Investment Arbitration* at \u00b6\u00b6 5.30-5.31 (**CLA-267**).\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimant submits that not only has the Respondent failed to discharge its burden of proving that its Renewed Request for Bifurcation satisfies the *Glamis Gold* test,30 but other case-dependent considerations also militate against bifurcation in this case.31 In fact, the Claimant alleges, when the \"obvious defects\" in the Respondent's objections are weighted against the harm, cost, and delay caused by bifurcation, it can be confirmed that bifurcation is not warranted.32\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 376-378.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 148-150.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 381(b).\n\n27.\n\nFirst, the Claimant advances that the Respondent's objections are frivolous as these are \"inconsistent with the facts pleaded in the arbitration.\"33 The Claimant asserts that it has articulated specific claims that largely rest on information arising from the publication in 2015 of materials related to the Hearing in *Mesa Power v. Canada*, held in October 2014 (the \"***Mesa Power*** **Hearing**\").34 According to the Claimant, during the *Mesa Power* Hearing, government officials administrating the Ontario Feed-In Tariff (\"**FIT**\") program made admissions of internationally wrongful conduct which form \"the fundamental basis\" of the Claimant's claim.35\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 193-197, 381(a).\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 63.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 242-246.\n\n28.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant alleges that the post-hearing briefs and the transcript of the *Mesa Power* Hearing revealed for the first time that: (i) government officials held secret meetings to, *inter alia*, take steps to protect the business prospects of an applicant to the FIT program which had connections with the Ontario government;36 (ii) [REDACTED] met with another company that applied to the FIT program, following which said company left a list with the government of six of its FIT projects that needed assistance;37 and (iii) Canada was providing preferential treatment to a foreign investor that had signed an agreement with the Ontario Government titled the Green Energy Investment Agreement (the \"**GEIA**\"), which exceeded the terms of that agreement.38 The Claimant underscores that it could have not accessed any of this this information prior to 2015 because the Respondent purposely concealed and suppressed this wrongful conduct.39\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 246-248. The Claimant specifies that this fact was revealed through the publication of the post-hearing briefs in the *Mesa Power* arbitration on 15 August 2015.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 246, 250. The Claimant specifies that this fact was revealed through the publication of the post-hearing briefs in the *Mesa Power* arbitration on 15 August 2015.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 246, 249. The Claimant specifies that this fact was revealed through the publication of the hearing transcript and post-hearing briefs in the *Mesa Power* arbitration on 30 April 2015 and 15 August 2015, respectively.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 243-245.\n\n29.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the Respondent's objection under Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA is frivolous because it is predicated on the suggestion that the Claimant must have known of the above-mentioned facts before these were made public.40 The Claimant asserts that the three-year period under Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA is initiated only when there is actual or constructive knowledge of both the breach and the loss or damage that has been incurred by the investor as a result.41 In this respect, the Claimant contends that the Respondent provides no evidence that these facts were known by the Claimant three years before the filing of the Notice of Arbitration (*i.e.*, before 1 June 2014).42\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 258-260.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 318-320.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant similarly contends that the Respondent's objection under Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA is frivolous.43 The Claimant submits that a claim does not arise until an investor is aware or could have been aware of the alleged breaches.44 The Claimant alleges it did not have knowledge of the Respondent's wrongful actions before 15 August 2015, the date of the publication of the *Mesa Power* post-hearing briefs.45 At that time, the Claimant avers, Tennant Energy owned 45.6% of Skyway 127's shares and \"had been exerting actual control over the project for years\".46 In any event, the Claimant submits that the NAFTA defines an \"investor\" as someone \"who makes, is making, or has made an investment.\"47 Thus, the Claimant argues, even if the Tribunal finds that the alleged breach arose before 15 August 2015, Tennant Energy would still qualify as an investor because since June 2011 it has held a beneficial interest in Skyway 127 that constituted a protected investment in the form of intangible property.48\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 263-278.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 154.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 153.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 176. *See also id.*, \u00b6\u00b6 264-265, *referring to* Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 772-773, Witness Statement of John C. Pennie, \u00b6 48 (**CWS-1**).\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 271.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 266, *referring to* Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 779-780. *See also* Response to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 268-278.\n\n31.\n\nWith respect to the above arguments, the Claimant cautions that ignoring evidence at the core of its claims, as the Respondent is doing with respect to the admissions made during the *Mesa Power* Hearing, would violate due process guarantees provided for in Article 1115 of the NAFTA and Article 15 of the UNCITRAL Rules.49 For this reason, the Claimant emphasizes that, absent evidence of bad faith, the Tribunal must consider the claims and facts as pled by the Claimant when considering the Respondent's bifurcation request.50\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 18-21, 25. *See also id.*, \u00b6 377.\n\n32.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's claim that its jurisdictional objections are not frivolous because they pertain to the scope of its consent to arbitrate under the NAFTA, the Claimant disagrees. According to the Claimant, as a matter of law, there can be no question that the Respondent consented to this arbitration because Article 1122 of the NAFTA \"represents an ongoing, fully valid offer to arbitrate, which the investor has accepted in bringing the present claim.\"51 The Claimant argues that the NAFTA contracting parties cannot unilaterally withdraw this consent to arbitrate.52 As such, the Claimant submits that any condition precedent established in the NAFTA, such as that under Article 1116(2), does not constitute a condition on the contracting parties' consent to arbitrate.53 Rather, in the Claimant's view, these are procedural issues that are decided upon by arbitral tribunals.54\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 362.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 360.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 363, 368-370.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 363, 368-370.\n\n33.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that bifurcating the proceedings would be inefficient because the Tribunal would need to engage in a substantial consideration of the merits in order to determine the Respondent's jurisdictional objections.55\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 322-340.\n\n34.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the Tribunal's determination of whether 15 August 2015 or earlier dates constitute the date of breach \"will be determinative of the jurisdictional questions\",56 because it would dictate when the three-year time limitation started running, and when the Claimant would have had to qualify as an \"investor\" under the NAFTA.57 According to the Claimant, such determination, in turn, \"requires a full consideration of all the evidence, including witnesses and experts\", as well as information obtained through document production.58 This is because, the Claimant contends, the Tribunal would have to engage in a review of (i) when the Claimant first obtained information about Ontario's internationally wrongful actions; (ii) the decision to limit transmission access in Ontario; (iii) whether the measures at issue in the *Mesa Power* arbitration could have been known by other applicants to the FIT program; (iv) whether the testimony of Mr. John C. Pennie, the Claimant's representative, should be considered regarding the bare trusteeship of Skyway 127 shares held by Tennant Energy and the control exercised by Tennant Energy over Skyway 127; and (v) the impact of the composite act of spoliation and the alleged secret meetings on the damages suffered by the Claimant.59\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 188.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 336.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 339.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 341.\n\n35.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant urges the Tribunal to consider the example of the *Mesa Power* arbitration in deciding whether to bifurcate. In *Mesa Power*, the Claimant notes, the tribunal initially ordered the bifurcation of proceedings in order to address as a preliminary question an objection regarding a temporal issue.60 After receiving further written submissions, however, the *Mesa Power* tribunal decided to reverse its decision on bifurcation on the basis that it could not decide on the objection at issue without substantially engaging in the facts of the dispute.61\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 343.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6\u00b6 344-345, *referring to Mesa Power Group, LLC v. Government of Canada,*PCA Case No. 2012-17, Procedural Order No. 3, \u00b6 73.\n\n36.\n\nThird, the Claimant contends that its \"case on the effects of spoliation of evidence is not an issue that Canada seeks to bifurcate.\"62 Accordingly, even if the Respondent's objections are successful in a first bifurcated phase, the arbitration would need to continue to the merits phase for the determination of this claim.63 Moreover, the Claimant maintains that \"given Canada's ongoing campaign to refuse to produce documents, the extent of the relevance of this particular breach cannot be fully assessed until document production has been completed.\"64 In fact, the Claimant considers that its \"entire claim concerning the harm caused to it arising from the spoliation of evidence relates to the information that will be produced from this document production phase.\"65 Thus, in the Claimant's view \"it makes no sense for jurisdiction to be bifurcated until that production happens.\"66\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 146.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 349.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 251.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 348.\n\nResponse to Renewed Bifurcation Request, \u00b6 251.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted two objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* for decision on a preliminary basis, namely: (i) the Claimant was not a protected \"investor of a Party\" when the alleged breach occurred, and therefore the Claimant has not met the requirements of Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA (\"**First Objection**\"); and (ii) the claim was not filed prior to the expiry of the 3-year limitation period articulated in Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA (\"**Second Objection**\").67\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 8.\n\n38.\n\nAs stated in PO4, the Tribunal is guided by three relevant considerations in the exercise of its discretion to bifurcate. These considerations are (i) whether the jurisdictional objection is frivolous; (ii) whether the objection, if successful, would materially reduce the time and costs of the proceeding; and (iii) whether the objection concerns issues intertwined with the merits of the arbitration.68\n\n*Glamis Gold v. United States*, \u00b6 12(c) (**RLA-054**).\n\n39.\n\nHaving carefully considered the submissions of the Parties, the Tribunal concludes that these considerations favour a bifurcation of the proceedings, with the scope of the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing to be determined after the Claimant's filing of its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n40.\n\nFirst, in the Tribunal's view, neither the Respondent's First Objection nor the Second Objection could be said to be frivolous. Without deciding the merits of the Respondent's two jurisdictional objections, it appears to the Tribunal that both Parties were able to cite authority for their respective positions, and the objections are not ones that could be dismissed out of hand.\n\n41.\n\nSecondly, either of the Respondent's two objections, if successful, could potentially dispose of the totality, and if not, essential parts of the Claimant's claim. There is a fair chance that bifurcation will allow for less evidence and more focused legal arguments at the next stage of the proceedings.\n\n42.\n\nThirdly, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent's First Objection can be examined without delving into the merits of the Claimant's claim. The Respondent's First Objection is discrete and focuses on: (i) when the alleged breach occurred; and (ii) when did the Claimant become an \"investor of a Party\" with an investment in Skyway 127. This is separate from the question of whether there is merit to the Claimant's allegations of breach. This is also separate from the question of whether the Claimant knew or should have known about the alleged breach, and/or the loss or damage arising from the breach.\n\n43.\n\nWith regard to the Respondent's Second Objection however, it is not yet clear to the Tribunal whether it would be able to determine this objection without delving into the merits of the Claimant's claim. At the heart of this objection is the question of whether the Claimant knew or should have known about the alleged breaches, as well as the loss or damage arising out of those breaches, more than three years prior to the filing of its Notice of Arbitration. On one hand, this could well be a relatively straightforward issue for decision on a preliminary basis. The Respondent's case is simply that the Claimant's allegations should have been known to the Claimant based on information that was publicly available prior to 1 June 2014, including the numerous public documents used in the *Mesa Power* arbitration and the *Mesa Power* submissions. On the other hand, depending on the evidence which the Claimant intends to adduce, the Tribunal may be required to substantially engage in the facts of the dispute, and to establish certain facts and connections between these facts. This may also involve significant testimony from, and cross-examination of, witnesses. In that case, the inquiry would be best conducted together with the merits phase when the Tribunal has the benefit of the entire record.\n\n44.\n\nIn the premises, the Tribunal grants the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation, at least with respect to the First Objection. However, with respect to the Second Objection, the Tribunal finds that it would be able to better assess whether this objection should similarly be decided on a preliminary basis after it has had sight of the Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. The Tribunal shall therefore determine the scope of the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing after the Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction is filed.\n\n45.\n\nHaving allowed the Respondent's bifurcation application, and having taken into account the fact that the time for the Claimant to prepare its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction overlaps with the Christmas and New Year periods, the Tribunal directs that the Claimant files its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction 60 days from the date of this procedural order. Thereafter, the Tribunal will issue the relevant procedural directions after it has come to a decision on the scope of the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n-------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal determines and orders as follows:\n\na. The Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation is granted;\n\nb. The scope of the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing shall be determined after the Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction is filed; and\n\nc. The issue of the costs of the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation is reserved to a further order, decision or award."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 9 (Renewed Request on Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2021-03-10T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 9 (Renewed Request on Bifurcation)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

The Tribunal further determined that the proceedings would continue in accordance with the procedural timetable set out in PO 1 for the non-bifurcated scenario, with certain modifications adopted to allow the Respondent to pursue the bifurcation of the proceedings after having had sight of the Claimant's Memorial. The Tribunal further directed that the Memorial would set out in full detail the Claimant's pleading on issues of jurisdiction, including the issue of the time-bar. In the event that the Respondent decided to renew its request for bifurcation, the Tribunal held that it would decide on that request on the papers without a hearing, and issue relevant procedural directions thereafter.\n\n6.\n\nOn 7 August 2020, the Claimant submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Quantum (the \u201c**Memorial**\u201d).\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 September 2020, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction (the \u201c**Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction**\u201d) and, in a separate filing, its renewed request for bifurcation (the \u201c**Renewed Request for Bifurcation**\u201d). In its Renewed Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent sought to have two jurisdictional objections determined on a preliminary basis, namely: (i) the Claimant was not a protected \u201cinvestor of a Party\u201d when the alleged breach occurred, and therefore the Claimant has not met the requirements of Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA (\u201c**First Objection**\u201d); and (ii) the claim was not filed prior to the expiry of the 3-year limitation period articulated in Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA (\u201c**Second Objection**\u201d).\n\n8.\n\nOn 13 October 2020, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent's renewed request for bifurcation (the \u201c**Response to Renewed Bifurcation Request**\u201d).\n\n9.\n\nOn 12 November 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 (\u201c**PO 8**\u201d), *inter alia*, granting the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation, but holding that the scope of the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing shall be determined after the Claimant's next submission on jurisdiction is filed on 11 January 2021. The Tribunal reasoned, in relevant part, that:\n\n42. Thirdly, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent's First Objection can be examined without delving into the merits of the Claimant's claim. The Respondent's First Objection is discrete and focuses on: (i) when the alleged breach occurred; and (ii) when did the Claimant become an \u201cinvestor of a Party\u201d with an investment in Skyway 127. This is separate from the question of whether there is merit to the Claimant's allegations of breach. This is also separate from the question of whether the Claimant knew or should have known about the alleged breach, and/or the loss or damage arising from the breach.\n\n43. With regard to the Respondent's Second Objection however, it is not yet clear to the Tribunal whether it would be able to determine this objection without delving into the merits of the Claimant's claim. At the heart of this objection is the question of whether the Claimant knew or should have known about the alleged breaches, as well as the loss or damage arising out of those breaches, more than three years prior to the filing of its Notice of Arbitration. On one hand, this could well be a relatively straightforward issue for decision on a preliminary basis. The Respondent's case is simply that the Claimant's allegations should have been known to the Claimant based on information that was publicly available prior to 1 June 2014, including the numerous public documents used in the *Mesa Power* arbitration and the *Mesa Power* submissions. On the other hand, depending on the evidence which the Claimant intends to adduce, the Tribunal may be required to substantially engage in the facts of the dispute, and to establish certain facts and connections between these facts. This may also involve significant testimony from, and cross-examination of, witnesses. In that case, the inquiry would be best conducted together with the merits phase when the Tribunal has the benefit of the entire record.\n\n44. In the premises, the Tribunal grants the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation, at least with respect to the First Objection. However, with respect to the Second Objection, the Tribunal finds that it would be able to better assess whether this objection should similarly be decided on a preliminary basis after it has had sight of the Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. The Tribunal shall therefore determine the scope of the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing after the Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction is filed.\n\n10.\n\nOn 19 November 2020, the Tribunal, in light of its decision in PO 8, informed the Parties that it was considering a three-day period in September 2021 for the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing, and invited the Parties to indicate (i) the number of days that they expect to require for the hearing; and (ii) whether they would be available during the dates the Tribunal was considering.\n\n11.\n\nOn 27 November 2020, the Respondent informed, *inter alia*, that it was agreeable to the dates being considered by the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 30 November 2020, the Claimant informed that both its lead counsel are unavailable in September 2021. Concerning the length of the hearing, the Claimant submitted that while it is currently \u201cnot possible to determine the number of witnesses that will need to be heard\u201d at the bifurcated hearing, in its view, \u201cit seems unlikely that three days will be sufficient\u201d and that a \u201cfull week hearing would be the minimum period needed.\u201d In the same letter, the Claimant separately contended that \u201cfairness and due process require\u201d that there be document production in the preliminary phase of the proceedings. The Claimant accordingly submitted that it should file its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction only after the Respondent has filed its Counter-Memorial on merits and damages, and the proposed document production phase has occurred.\n\n13.\n\nOn 3 December 2020, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and revert with possible hearing dates in the first three weeks of November. The Tribunal noted that the Parties' responses would be without prejudice to the outstanding issues raised in the Claimant's 30 November 2020 letter.\n\n14.\n\nOn 9 December 2020, the Claimant updated the Tribunal on the Parties' discussions concerning hearing dates and, *inter alia*, informed that the Parties are available from 8 to 19 November 2021, with a preference on the Claimant's part for 15 to 19 November 2021.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated 15 December 2020, and at the Tribunal's invitation, the Respondent responded to the Claimant's 30 November 2020 letter. The Respondent (i) stated that it considered a three-day hearing to be sufficient; (ii) objected to the Claimant's submissions concerning the procedural calendar in their entirety; and (iii) requested the Tribunal to award all associated costs incurred in its favour.\n\n16.\n\nOn 15 December 2020, the Claimant, *inter alia*, sought leave from the Tribunal to submit a response to the Respondent's 15 December 2020 letter within 14 days. On the same day, the Respondent, *inter alia*, objected to the Claimant's request on the basis that it was neither necessary nor efficient.\n\n17.\n\nOn 18 December 2020, the Tribunal rejected the Claimant's request, noting its view that no further submissions from the Parties were necessary, and stated that it will revert to the Parties concerning the outstanding matters in due course.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 23 December 2020, the Tribunal rejected the Claimant's submissions concerning the procedural calendar, including its proposal for document production in the preliminary phase of proceedings, and \u201cconfirm[ed] that, in accordance with PO1 and PO8, the Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction shall be due on 11 January 2021. Thereafter, after determining whether the Second Objection will be addressed in the preliminary phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal shall fix the deadlines for the remaining procedural steps in accordance with the procedural calendar set out in Annex 1 of PO1.\u201d The Tribunal further requested all parties to tentatively reserve at least five days, from 15 to 19 November 2021, as potential dates for the hearing, and noted that it would confirm the length of the bifurcated hearing once it has decided on its scope.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated 23 December 2020, the Claimant (i) requested an extension from 11 January to 1 March 2021 for the filing of its next submission on jurisdiction; and (ii) proposed a revised procedural calendar, which reflected corresponding adjustments to what it considered to be the remaining procedural events for this phase, namely the Reply and Rejoinder Memorials on Jurisdiction, the non-disputing Party submissions, and the disputing Parties' responses to those submissions.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated 29 December 2020, the Respondent responded to the Claimant's 23 December letter at the Tribunal's invitation, agreeing to the Claimant's extension request, but objecting to the Claimant's proposed procedural calendar. The Respondent contended in particular that (i) Reply and Rejoinder Memorials on Jurisdiction are not necessary since both Parties would have each already completed two rounds of submissions on jurisdiction; and (ii) the proposed calendar does not account for the Tribunal's decision on the scope of the preliminary phase following the Claimant's next submission on jurisdiction.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter dated 10 January 2021, the Tribunal (i) confirmed, in accordance with the Parties' consent, that the deadline for the Claimant's next submission on jurisdiction is extended from 11 January to 1 March 2021; and (ii) agreed with the Respondent that two rounds of submissions on jurisdiction from each Party are sufficient, and adopted the following procedural calendar proposed by the Respondent:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Procedural Event** | **Date** |\n| Claimant's Reply on Jurisdiction | 1 March 2021 |\n| Tribunal's Decision on Scope of Bifurcated Phase of Proceedings | [TBD] |\n| **Procedural Event** | **Date** |\n| Respondent's Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction | + 45 days |\n| Submissions of the United States and Mexico Pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 (if any) | +30 days |\n| Responses to 1128 Submissions (if any) | +15 days |\n\n22.\n\nOn 1 March 2021, the Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (the \u201c**Reply on Jurisdiction**\u201d).\n\n**II. T****he** **P****arties****' P****ositions**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Parties' arguments concerning the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation, as set out in the Respondent's and the Claimant's respective submissions of 21 September and 13 October 2020, have been summarized in PO 81 and shall not be repeated here.\n\nPO 8, \u00b6\u00b6 16-36.\n\n24.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, which was submitted after PO 8 was issued, the Claimant restated and elaborated upon two arguments that it had previously made in support of its position that the Tribunal should reject the Respondent's request to consider the Second Objection in a preliminary phase.2 Specifically, that bifurcating the Second Objection would be inefficient because (i) said Objection is frivolous and inconsistent with the facts pleaded in the arbitration; and (ii) the Tribunal would need to engage in a substantial consideration of the merits in order to determine said Objection.3\n\n*See* Reply on Jurisdiction, Section III.D.\n\n*See* PO 8, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29, 33-34.\n\n25.\n\nFirst, the Claimant maintained that the Respondent's objection under Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA, namely that the Claimant's claim is barred because it was filed after the expiry of the 3-year limitation, is not sustainable. This is because, as the Claimant has pleaded, it did not know and could not have known about the wrongful conduct of the government officials administrating the Ontario Feed-In Tariff (\u201c**FIT**\u201d) program, which forms the fundamental basis of its claim, before 15 August 2015, the date of publication of the *Mesa Power* post-hearing briefs.4\n\n*See* PO 8, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29; Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 268.\n\n26.\n\nFor the same reason, the Claimant further argued in its Reply on Jurisdiction that the two alternative dates of breach alleged by the Respondent, 4 July 2011 and 12 June 2013, must be rejected.5 4 July 2011 was the date on which Skyway 127 was placed on a FIT priority waiting list, instead of being awarded a FIT Contract. The Claimant contended that this date could not have been the date of breach because, at the time, Skyway 127 was also informed that it remained in the running for a contract.6 The Claimant similarly asserted that 12 June 2013, the date the FIT Program was terminated, could not have been the date of breach either because, at that time, the Claimant did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the Ontario government's wrongful conduct.7\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 265.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 266.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 267\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimant also rejected the Respondent's claim that \u201csomehow knowledge of other factors relating to Canada's wrongful administration of the FIT Program should have enabled Tennant Energy to realize that [the alleged breach had occurred].\u201d8 According to the Claimant and its witnesses, \u201cSkyway 127 and Tennant Energy believed Ontario conducted the FIT Program under its rules in a fair manner\u201d up until 15 August 2015.9 In fact, the Claimant further argued, the Ontario government's concealment of this information up until that date \u201cforms an essential part of the composite breach.\u201d10\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 269.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 272.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 271.\n\n28.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant reiterated that the Tribunal would need to engage in a substantial consideration of the merits in order to determine the Second Objection.11 In the Claimant's view, the \u201cthree-year-limitation provision is not designed for the Tribunal to determine before a merits-hearing which will enable the tribunal to determine whether a claim existed at a particular point in time or the scope of that claim.\u201d12 In particular, the Claimant contends that the Tribunal \u201cwould be required to review the merits of this case in a detailed manner\u201d in order to determine whether the Claimant should have known about the wrongful conduct years before 15 August 2015, despite the Ontario government's failure to date to publicly disclose the existence of a decision-making body such as the \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d.13\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 273.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 53.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 273-274.\n\n**III. T****he** **T****ribunal****'****s** **A****nalysis**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nAs stated in PO 4, the Tribunal is guided by three relevant considerations in the exercise of its discretion to bifurcate. These considerations are (i) whether the jurisdictional objection is frivolous; (ii) whether the objection, if successful, would materially reduce the time and costs of the proceeding; and (iii) whether the objection concerns issues intertwined with the merits of the arbitration.\n\n30.\n\nHaving carefully considered the submissions of the parties, the Tribunal concluded in PO8 that these considerations favour a bifurcation of the proceedings, at least with respect of the First Objection.\n\n31.\n\nAs for the Second Objection, the Tribunal decided in PO 8 that the Second Objection could not be said to be frivolous, and if successful, could potentially dispose of the totality, and if not, essential parts of the Claimant's claim. However, at the time PO 8 was issued, it was not yet clear to the Tribunal whether it would be able to determine this objection without delving into the merits of the Claimant's claim. Consequently, the Tribunal held that it would determine the scope of the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing after the Claimant's Reply on Jurisdiction is filed.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the Claimant's Reply on Jurisdiction and finds that the Second Objection should similarly be decided on a preliminary basis at the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing.\n\n33.\n\nAs the Tribunal observed in PO8, at the heart of the Second Objection is the question of whether the Claimant knew or should have known about the alleged breaches, as well as loss or damage arising out of those breaches, more than three years prior to the filing of its Notice of Arbitration. Based on the Parties' submissions on jurisdiction to date, this issue appears to be relatively straightforward and one that is suitable for decision on a preliminary basis.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent's case is that the Claimant's allegations should have been known to the Claimant based on information that was publicly available prior to 1 June 2014, including the numerous public documents used in the *Mesa Power* arbitration and the *Mesa Power* submissions.\n\n35.\n\nIn response, the Claimant has made clear that its claim is about: (i) special business opportunities provided to a politically connected local favourite, IPC; (ii) the \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d cabal of politicians and senior officials systemically abusing the process to reward friends at the expense of everyone else; (iii) Ontario's decision to not complete its FIT Program for the Bruce Region contrary to the legitimate expectation of FIT Proponents such as Skyway 127; (iv) the delay of the award of contracts because of Korean Consortium's failure to comply with its contractual obligations; and (v) the conspiracy in the systemic violations of the NAFTA and the spoilation and wanton destruction of evidence by Ontario.14 According to the Claimant, all the allegations as articulated above \u201c*deal with information that Canada suppressed from the public and which was not and could not be known before June 1 2014*\u201d,15 which \u201c*only became known because of cross-examinations of Canada's witnesses at the Mesa Power Hearing in October 2014, and subsequently disclosed in 2015*\u201d.16\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 14.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 15.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent's Second Objection can be examined without delving into or prejudging the merits of the Claimant's claim. The Tribunal need only consider whether the Claimant knew or did not know at the material time, or whether it should have reasonably known about the alleged breaches and losses, having regard to the specific allegations of breach as pleaded by the Claimant. It is not for the Tribunal to consider at the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing whether there is merit to the Claimant's pleaded allegations.\n\n37.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal is of the view that the determination of the Second Objection would not involve significant testimony from, and cross-examination of witnesses. The Claimant has proffered three factual witnesses in support of its Second Objection, namely Mr John C Pennie, Mr John Tennant and Mr Derek Tennant. The crux of all three witness testimonies is simply that the Claimant had no knowledge of the allegations until 2015 when the events of the *Mesa Power* Hearing were made public, and that there was an expectation that the Respondent would act in good faith regarding Skyway 127's application in the FIT Program.17\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 412-420.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the Claimant has proffered these same three factual witnesses in respect of the First Objection. Thus, having the First Objection and Second Objection heard together at the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing would likely result in efficiency savings.\n\n**IV. T****he** **T****ribunal****'****s** **D****ecision**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal determines and orders as follows:\n\na. The Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation is granted in respect of both the First Objection and the Second Objection; and\n\nb. The issue of costs arising from the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation is reserved to a further order, decision or award."}, {"Title": "Tribunal's Decision on the Respondent's Request for Leave to Submit Additional Confidentiality Designations to the Hearing Transcripts", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2022-04-11T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Tribunal's Decision on the Respondent's Request for Leave to Submit Additional Confidentiality Designations to the Hearing Transcripts\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nDear Mesdames, dear Sirs,\n\n[2].\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the Respondent's communications of 8 March 2022 and 15 March 2022, as well as the Claimant's communication of 10 March 2022.\n\n[3].\n\nThe Tribunal hereby rejects the Respondent's request for leave to submit additional confidentiality designations to the Hearing Transcripts. The Tribunal notes that the disputing parties had negotiated and agreed on the confidentiality designations to the Hearing Transcripts on 4 February 2022. The agreed Hearing Transcripts were thereafter published on the PCA website pursuant to the parties' agreement and were publicly accessible for a month before the Respondent's request was made. Having regard to these circumstances, absent a strong and compelling reason, the Tribunal can see no reason for the Respondent to now submit additional confidentiality designations.\n\n[4].\n\nIn the Respondent's communication of 15 March 2022, the Respondent explained that it had inadvertently disclosed certain confidential information within the Hearing transcript, that the mistake had not been unreasonable, and that inadvertent disclosure of information does not constitute a waiver of confidentiality. This, though, in the Tribunal's view, is not a strong or compelling reason for the Tribunal to permit additional confidentiality designations, having regard to the parties' agreement of 4 February 2022 and, significantly, to the publication of the agreed Hearing Transcripts on the basis of that agreement. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal notes as well the presumption in favour of publication evident in paragraph 1 of the Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions (NAFTA Free Trade Commission, 31 July 2001).\n\n[5].\n\nNow that the Tribunal has decided on the Respondent's request for leave to submit additional confidentiality designations to the Hearing Transcripts, the Tribunal hereby directs the parties to try to reach an agreement on the confidentiality designations to the Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief as soon as possible.\n\n[6].\n\nAs for the format in which the Respondent should provide the Claimant with its proposed designations to the Hearing videos, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Claimant's request for an instruction from the Tribunal in this regard is premature. The Tribunal further notes that the Respondent has indicated that it will provide the Claimant with copies of the Hearing transcripts with highlighting on the specific information it seeks to designate for the Hearing videos. Likewise, the parties are encouraged to try to reach an agreement on the confidentiality designations to the Hearing videos."}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2022-10-25T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**T****ABLE OF** **A****BBREVIATIONS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Canada** | Government of Canada |\n| **Claimant or Tennant Energy** | Tennant Energy, LLC |\n| **Claimant's Costs Submission** | Claimant's Statement of Costs, dated 15 July 2022 |\n| **Claimant's PHB** | Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, dated 17 December 2021 |\n| **Claimant's Second Article 1128 Submission** | Claimant's Second Response to the Submissions of the United States and Mexico pursuant to Article 1128 of the NAFTA, dated 26 July 2021 |\n| **Claimant's** ***Westmoreland*** **Submission** | Claimant's submission on the award in *Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v.

By its Procedural Orders Nos. 8 and 9, dated 12 November 2020 and 10 March 2021, respectively, the Tribunal ordered the bifurcation of the proceedings, such that two of those objections would be decided as preliminary questions, namely, that (a) the Claimant was not a protected \"investor of a Party\" when the alleged breach occurred, and therefore the Claimant has not met the requirements of Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA (the \"**First Objection**\"); and (b) the claim was not filed prior to the expiry of the 3-year limitation period articulated in Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA (the \"**Second Objection**\", and together with the First Objection, the \"**Preliminary Objections**\").

The Tribunal further heard oral submissions by the United States on questions of interpretation of the NAFTA regarding the Motion for Security for Costs, pursuant to Article 1128 of the Treaty.\n\n40.\n\nOn 4 February 2020, the Respondent requested leave to introduce into the record the Decision on the respondent's Request for Security for Costs and the claimant's Request for Security for Claim in *Dirk Herzig as Insolvency Administrator over the Assets of Unionmatex Industrieanlagen GmbH v.

The Claimant objected to this request on the same date.\n\n41.\n\nOn 10 February 2020, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to file the Decision in *Dirk Herzig* and invited the Parties to provide their comments thereon.\n\n42.\n\nOn 17 February 2020, the Respondent submitted the Decision in *Dirk Herzig* into the record as exhibit RLA-112 and its comments thereon.

The Tribunal further directed that the Memorial should set out in full detail the Claimant's pleading on issues of jurisdiction, including the issue of the time-bar. In the event that the Respondent decided to renew its request for bifurcation, the Tribunal held that it would decide that request on the papers without a hearing and issue relevant procedural directions thereafter.12\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, \u00b6\u00b6 69, 183(a).\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, \u00b6\u00b6 88, 183(b).\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, \u00b6\u00b6 106-108, 183(c).\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, \u00b6\u00b6 181, 183(d).\n\nProcedural Order No. 4, \u00b6\u00b6 92-93, 183(b).\n\n44.\n\nOn 2 March 2020, the Parties respectively requested, *inter alia*, that the Tribunal rule on the Respondent's confidentiality designations as set out in their Disputed Designations Schedule pursuant to the Confidentiality Order.\n\n45.\n\nOn 3 March 2020, the Claimant provided its response to the Respondent's e-mail of 2 March 2020.\n\n46.\n\nOn 4 March 2020, the Tribunal indicated that it considered the confidentiality designations to be ripe for decision and stated that it would render a decision in this respect in due course.\n\n47.\n\nOn 27 March 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, setting out its decision on the Respondent's confidentiality designations in the Disputed Designations Schedule submitted on 2 March 2020.\n\n48.\n\nOn 3 April 2020, the Respondent filed a Motion for Targeted Document Production, requesting that the Claimant be ordered to produce certain categories of documents relating to the Claimant's ability to comply with an adverse costs award (the \"**Motion for Targeted Document Production**\").

On 8 May 2020, the Respondent consented to the Claimant's request. On 10 May 2020, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties' agreed amendments to the procedural schedule.\n\n52.\n\nOn 27 June 2020, the Claimant explained that it continued to experience difficulties caused by the worsening pandemic and requested a further one-month extension of the deadline for the filing of the Memorial, along with corresponding modifications to the two immediately following deadlines. On 3 July 2020, the Respondent agreed to the Claimant's proposed modifications and, the next day, the Tribunal approved the modifications to the procedural calendar, as agreed by the Parties.\n\n53.\n\nOn 7 August 2020, the Claimant filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits and Quantum (the \"**Memorial**\"), accompanied by the witness statement of John C. Pennie (CWS-1) (\"**Pennie Statement**\"), and the expert valuation report of Deloitte LLP (CER-1) (\"**Deloitte Report**\").\n\n54.\n\nOn 10 August 2020, the Respondent asserted that the Claimant had in its Memorial inappropriately used information contained in unredacted videos of the hearing in the *Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada* (PCA Case No. 2012-17) arbitration (\"***Mesa Power***\") that had been designated as confidential, and requested the Tribunal to order appropriate remedies.\n\n55.\n\nOn 18 August 2020, the Claimant submitted its \"Response to Canada's Motion to Suppress Evidence from the Public and the Tribunal\", accompanied by the witness statement of Ms. Parthenya Taiyanides (CWS-2). In its response, the Claimant requested the Tribunal reject the Respondent's 10 August 2020 request.\n\n56.\n\nOn 26 August 2020, the Respondent submitted its reply to the Claimant's submission of 18 August 2020.\n\n57.\n\nOn 2 September 2020, the Claimant submitted its rejoinder to the Respondent's reply of 26 August 2020, accompanied by the witness statement of Mr. Justin Giovannetti (CWS-3).\n\n58.\n\nOn 21 September 2020, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction (the \"**Counter-Memorial**\") and, in a separate filing, its renewed request for bifurcation (the \"**Renewed Request for Bifurcation**\"), which was accompanied by the witness statement of Mr. Lucas McCall (RWS-1) (\"**McCall Statement**\"). In its Renewed Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to bifurcate the proceedings and consider the Preliminary Objections as preliminary questions.13\n\nRenewed Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 2, 21-22.\n\n59.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 7**, by which the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's request of 10 August 2020.\n\n60.\n\nOn 13 October 2020, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation.\n\n61.\n\nOn 28 October 2020, the Respondent sought leave (a) to submit into the record as a new legal authority the *Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v. Government of Canada* (ICSID Case No. UNCT/20/3) Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on Bifurcation), dated 20 October 2020 (the \"***Westmoreland*** **Decision**\"); and (b) for both disputing Parties to file submissions on the relevance of the *Westmoreland* Decision to the Renewed Request for Bifurcation.\n\n62.\n\nOn 30 October 2020, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimant provided its response to the Respondent's 28 October 2020 request, stating that it \"oppose[d] [it] based on practicality, delay, and cost.\" Further, in the event that the Tribunal decided to admit the *Westmoreland* Decision into the record, the Claimant argued that a specific procedure should then follow, according to which both the disputing and non-disputing Parties would be given the opportunity to file submissions and the Parties would then be given the opportunity to respond to the non-disputing Parties' submissions.\n\n63.\n\nOn 10 November 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, prior to receipt of the Respondent's request concerning the *Westmoreland* Decision, it had already decided on the course to be followed in connection with the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation. As such, it saw no need to depart from that decision for purposes of receiving further submissions from the Parties on the *Westmoreland* Decision. Taking account of the fact that the *Westmoreland* Decision was already in the public domain, the Tribunal nevertheless granted the Respondent permission to submit it into the record, without comment from the Parties.\n\n64.\n\nOn 12 November 2020, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 8**, by which the Tribunal granted the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation, with the scope of the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing to be determined after the Claimant's filing of its ensuing submission on jurisdiction.14 In particular, the Tribunal determined that, while at least the First Objection warranted the bifurcation of the proceedings, it would decide whether the preliminary review of the Second Objection was appropriate after it had sight of the Claimant's Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction.15\n\nProcedural Order No. 8, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 46.\n\nProcedural Order No. 8, \u00b6 44.\n\n**E. B****ifurcated** **J****urisdictional** **P****hase**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nOn 30 November 2020, the Claimant submitted *inter alia* that \"fairness and due process require\" that there be document production in the preliminary phase of the proceedings. The Claimant further submitted that it should file its Reply on Jurisdiction only after the Respondent had filed its Counter-Memorial on merits and damages, and the proposed document production phase had occurred.\n\n66.\n\nOn 15 December 2020, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's 30 November 2020 submissions.\n\n67.\n\nOn 23 December 2020, the Tribunal, having considered the Parties' views, rejected the Claimant's proposal for document production in the preliminary phase of proceedings, and \"confirm[ed] that, in accordance with PO1 and PO8, the Claimant's Reply on Jurisdiction shall be due on 11 January 2021. Thereafter, after determining whether the Second Objection will be addressed in the preliminary phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal shall fix the deadlines for the remaining procedural steps in accordance with the procedural calendar set out in Annex 1 of PO1.\"\n\n68.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant (a) requested an extension from 11 January to 1 March 2021 for the filing of its next submission on jurisdiction; and (b) proposed a revised procedural calendar, which reflected corresponding adjustments to what it considered to be the remaining procedural events for this phase, namely the Reply and Rejoinder Memorials on Jurisdiction, the non-disputing Party submissions, and the disputing Parties' responses to those submissions.\n\n69.\n\nOn 29 December 2020, the Respondent agreed to the Claimant's request to extend the deadline for the filing of its Reply on Jurisdiction. However, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's proposed procedural calendar, submitting its own proposal for a revised procedural calendar. The Respondent contended, in particular, that (a) reply and rejoinder memorials on jurisdiction were not necessary since both Parties would have each already completed two rounds of submissions on jurisdiction; and (b) the Claimant's proposed calendar did not account for the Tribunal's decision on the scope of the preliminary phase following the Claimant's Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction.\n\n70.\n\nOn 10 January 2021, the Tribunal (a) confirmed the Parties' agreement regarding the extension of the deadline for the filing of the Claimant's Reply on Jurisdiction; and (b) adopted the procedural calendar proposed by the Respondent.\n\n71.\n\nOn 1 March 2021, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (the \"**Reply**\"), accompanied by the witness statements of Mr. John H. Tennant (CWS-2) and Mr. Derek Tennant (CWS-3), as well as the expert legal opinion of Hon. Margaret Grignon (CER-2) (the \"**Grignon Report**\").\n\n72.\n\nOn 10 March 2021, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 9**, *inter alia*, deciding on the scope of the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing and granting the Respondent's Renewed Request for Bifurcation in respect of both Preliminary Objections.\n\n73.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal (a) contending that Procedural Order No. 9 erroneously \"omits Tennant Energy's opportunity to respond by filing a Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction\", and proposing a modified procedural schedule for the remainder of the bifurcated jurisdiction phase correcting this alleged error; (b) requesting an extension from 15 to 30 days of the time period for the Parties to respond to the non-disputing Parties' submissions; and (c) requesting guidance on the length and dates for the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing.\n\n74.\n\nOn 12 March 2021, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Respondent responded, *inter alia*, (a) rejecting the Claimant's proposed schedule; and (b) raising no objections to the Claimant's extension request.\n\n75.\n\nBy letter dated 23 March 2021, the Tribunal (a) rejected the Claimant's proposed schedule and corresponding request to file an additional submission on jurisdiction after the Respondent's second submission on jurisdiction, on the basis that it had already decided this issue in its 10 January 2021 letter and saw no reason to depart from the said decision; (b) in the absence of any objections from the Respondent to the Claimant's request, the Tribunal confirmed that the time period for the Parties to respond to the non-disputing Parties' submissions would be extended from 15 to 30 days; and (c) decided that the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing would take place over a maximum of four days, in the period from 15 to 19 November 2021, the final hearing schedule to be determined in the light of the Parties' agreement, if any, or submissions, in advance of the pre-hearing conference.\n\n76.\n\nOn 26 March 2021, the Respondent, *inter alia*, requested that the Tribunal make a final determination with respect to disputed confidentiality designations to exhibit C-108 and the videos of the hearing in *Mesa Power*.\n\n77.\n\nOn 5 April 2021, the Claimant submitted its response to the Respondent's request of 26 March 2021.\n\n78.\n\nOn 13 April 2021, the Respondent submitted its reply to the Claimant's response of 5 April 2021.\n\n79.\n\nOn 15 April 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 which set out in its Annex I the revised procedural calendar for the bifurcated jurisdictional phase.\n\n80.\n\nOn 20 April 2021, the Claimant submitted its rejoinder comments to the Respondent's reply of 13 April 2021.\n\n81.\n\nOn 1 May 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, adopting an amended procedural calendar for the Bifurcated Jurisdictional phase agreed upon by the Parties.\n\n82.\n\nOn 5 May 2021, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 12,** by which the Tribunal rejected the Respondent's request of 26 March 2021.\n\n83.\n\nOn 26 May 2021, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"**Rejoinder**\"), accompanied by the expert legal opinion of Margaret G. Lodise (RER-1) (the \"**Lodise Report**\").\n\n84.\n\nOn 11 June 2021, the United States notified the Tribunal of its intention to make a written submission on matters of interpretation of the NAFTA in the bifurcated jurisdictional phase of the proceedings.\n\n85.\n\nOn 25 June 2021, Mexico and the United States filed their respective submissions regarding the Preliminary Objections pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 (\"**Mexico's Second Submission**\" and the \"**United States' Second Submission**\", respectively)\n\n86.\n\nOn 26 July 2021, the Parties filed their respective Responses to the non-disputing Parties' submissions regarding the Preliminary Objections pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 (the \"**Claimant's Second Article 1128 Submission**\" and the \"**Respondent's Second Article 1128 Submission**\").\n\n**F. H****earing on** **J****urisdiction**\n------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nOn 27 August 2021, the Respondent proposed that the bifurcated jurisdictional hearing (the \"**Hearing on Jurisdiction**\") take place in person in Toronto, Canada. In support thereof, the Respondent relied on paragraph 3.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, which provided that hearings may take place at locations other than Washington D.C., if so decided by the Tribunal after consultation with the Parties.\n\n88.\n\nOn 3 September 2021, the Claimant advised the Tribunal that it did not share the Respondent's view about holding the Hearing on Jurisdiction in-person due to the on-going COVID-19-related health concerns and travel restrictions.\n\n89.\n\nOn 8 September 2021, the Tribunal decided that the Hearing on Jurisdiction would proceed by way of a videoconference, noting that virtual hearings had been conducted in numerous cases with good efficiency. The Tribunal further informed the Parties that, in accordance with paragraphs 13.1 and 13.2 of PO1, it would propose a draft virtual hearing protocol for the Parties to consider.\n\n90.\n\nOn 16 September 2021, the Respondent requested a ruling from a Tribunal for permission to submit into the record the Award in *MAKAE Europe SARL v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/42) dated 30 August 2021 (the \"***MAKAE*** **Award**\").\n\n91.\n\nOn 16 September 2021, the Tribunal circulated a draft of Procedural Order No. 14 (a virtual hearing protocol for the Hearing on Jurisdiction) and invited the Parties' comments thereon.\n\n92.\n\nOn 25 September 2021, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimant noted that, to its knowledge, the *MAKAE* Award had not been released to the public and sought \"clarification of the [*MAKAE* Award]'s status before being able to address whether this decision should be admitted into the record.\"\n\n93.\n\nOn 8 October 2021, the Respondent explained that it had obtained a copy of the *MAKAE* Award through Investment Arbitration Reporter, an online subscription-based source.\n\n94.\n\nOn 14 October 2021, the Parties submitted their agreed proposed amendments to the draft Procedural Order No. 14. By separate correspondence of the same date, the Parties provided comments on outstanding points of disagreements on the draft Order.\n\n95.\n\nOn 16 October 2021, the Tribunal provided certain guidance to the Parties and directed them to confer with a view to reducing the number of outstanding issues relating to draft Procedural Order No. 14 in advance of the pre-hearing conference scheduled for 19 October 2021.\n\n96.\n\nOn 18 October 2021, the Parties submitted an updated version of the draft Procedural Order No. 14, noting that the issue of the hearing schedule remained outstanding.\n\n97.\n\nAlso on 18 October 2021, the Respondent recalled its 16 September 2021 request to have the *MAKAE* Award added to the record and inquired whether the Tribunal required anything further to assist in its decision on the matter.\n\n98.\n\nOn 19 October 2021, a pre-hearing conference was held by video-conference, in which counsel and representatives for both Parties, all members of the Tribunal, and the PCA participated, to discuss the organization of the Hearing on Jurisdiction, as well as the Respondent's request to add the *MAKAE* Award into the record.\n\n99.\n\nOn 25 October 2021, at the Tribunal's direction, the PCA wrote to ICSID seeking clarification in respect of the authenticity of the version of the*MAKAE*\u00a0Awardpublished in Investment Arbitration Reporter. On the same date, ICSID noted that the parties in the *MAKAE* case \"have not consented to the publication of the Award to date\", meaning that ICSID was \"unable to address the authenticity or completeness of the version presented to the tribunal\".\n\n100.\n\nOn 26 October 2021, following the Tribunal's direction, the Parties jointly proposed an indicative schedule for the Hearing on Jurisdiction for the Tribunal's consideration.\n\n101.\n\nOn 27 October 2021, the Tribunal requested that the Parties provide indicative timings for each step in their proposed draft hearing schedule. Following an inquiry from the Claimant of the same date, the Tribunal reiterated this direction to the Parties on 28 October 2021.\n\n102.\n\nOn 31 October 2021, the Parties submitted an agreed indicative schedule for the Hearing on Jurisdiction.\n\n103.\n\nOn 2 November 2021, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 14**, whereby the Tribunal made directions for the procedure of the Hearing on Jurisdiction and set forth a hearing schedule. As noted in Section 5.4 of Procedural Order No. 14, the non-disputing Parties notified the Tribunal that they did not expect to make oral submissions during the Hearing on Jurisdiction.\n\n104.\n\nOn 5 November 2021, the Respondent reiterated its request to add to the record the *MAKAE* Award.\n\n105.\n\nOn 8 November 2021, the Claimant provided its response to the Respondent's 5 November 2021 submission concerning the *MAKAE* Award.\n\n106.\n\nOn 9 November 2021, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's application to admit the *MAKAE* Award into the record. The Respondent filed the *MAKAE* Award on the same date.\n\n107.\n\nThe Hearing on Jurisdiction was held from 15 to 19 November 2021 by video-conference. The following persons attended the Hearing on Jurisdiction:\n\n**Tribunal**\n\nMr. Cavinder Bull SC (Presiding Arbitrator)  \nMr. R.

Lodise.\n\n110.\n\nFollowing discussions with the Parties at the close of the Hearing, the Tribunal issued questions to the Parties to be addressed in the Parties' respective post-hearing briefs, directing the Parties to make simultaneous submissions by 17 December 2021 and the Claimant to file a further submission, limited only to responding to the Respondent's submissions during the hearing on the matter of successor in interest, by 22 December 2021.\n\n**G. P****ost****-H****earing** **P****roceedings**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nOn 17 December 2021, the Parties respectively submitted their post-hearing briefs (the Claimant's post-hearing brief (the \"**Claimant's PHB**\") and the Respondent's post-hearing brief (the \"**Respondent's PHB**\")).\n\n112.\n\nOn 22 December 2021, the Claimant filed its Response to Canada's Post Hearing Brief on Transfers (the \"**Response to the Respondent's PHB**\").\n\n113.\n\nOn 16 February 2022, the Respondent filed a dual application (a) to submit into the record the Final Award in *Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v. Government of Canada* (ICSID Case No. UNCT/20/3), dated 31 January 2022 (the \"***Westmoreland*** **Award**\"); and (b) for security for costs.\n\n114.\n\nOn 24 February 2022, at the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimant submitted its response to the Respondent's application of 16 February 2022.\n\n115.\n\nOn 20 April 2022, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's application to submit into the record the *Westmoreland* Award and invited the Parties to address the Award by 4 May 2022. As for the Respondent's renewed application for security for costs, the Tribunal indicated that it would address the issue in this Final Award.\n\n116.\n\nOn 4 May 2022, the Respondent filed its submission on the *Westmoreland* Award (the \"**Respondent's** ***Westmoreland*** **Submission**\"). Noting that its textual interpretation of NAFTA Article 1116(1) aligned with that advanced by the *Westmoreland* tribunal, with which all NAFTA Parties agreed, the Respondent maintained that the NAFTA offered no mechanism to assign investment claims to separate investors who did not hold the investment at the time of the alleged breach. According to the Respondent, the Claimant failed to satisfy the jurisdictional pre-requisites articulated in the *Westmoreland* Award because the Claimant's acquisition of the investment, after the alleged breach occurred for the purpose of bringing the NAFTA claims, did not constitute a *bona fide* transaction. Furthermore, the Respondent, *inter alia*, clarified that (a) NAFTA Article 1109 was a substantive obligation and thus was not relevant to the Tribunal's determination of its jurisdiction; (b) domestic law was not dispositive to the question of whether the right to bring a NAFTA claim may be assigned; and (c) a separate entity, like Tennant Energy that merely acquired the investment years after the alleged breach, could not be a \"legal successor\" who could continue a NAFTA claim.\n\n117.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant filed its submission on the *Westmoreland* Award (the \"**Claimant's** ***Westmoreland*** **Submission**\"). According to the Claimant, the *Westmoreland* Award was inapposite because (a) the Claimant already owned and controlled the investment (*i.e.*, the Skyway 127 shares) at the time it had actual knowledge of the Respondent's breach of its NAFTA obligations; and (b) unlike the situation in *Westmoreland* where only specific claims were assigned to the claimant through bankruptcy, Tennant Energy was the \"successor in interest\" in relation to all rights and liabilities attached to the Skyway 127 shares, including any treaty claims, that Mr. John Tennant previously held. In any event, the Claimant considered that the *Westmoreland* tribunal erred by failing to take into account NAFTA Article 1109, which, according to the Claimant, permitted the transfer of a claim between foreign nationals insofar as there is no change in the underlying nationality. Consequently, the Claimant submitted that the Tribunal should not rely upon the *Westmoreland* Award, which was \"contradictory to general principle of international law and by the *jurisprudence constante*\".\n\n118.\n\nOn 26 May 2022, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal give advance notice regarding the issuance of its Award on Jurisdiction. The Claimant submitted its comments on such request the same day.\n\n119.\n\nOn 24 June 2022, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file submissions on costs. The Parties filed their respective Submissions on Costs on 15 July 2022 (the \"**Claimant's Costs Submission**\" and the \"**Respondent's Costs Submission**\").\n\n**III.

Declare that Tennant Energy is an Investor as defined by NAFTA Article 1139 as of April 26, 2011 over Tennant Energy's investment in Skyway 127 Wind Energy;\n\nb. Declare that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over Tennant Energy's NAFTA Chapter Eleven claim;\n\nc. Dismiss Canada's jurisdictional application in its entirety and order that this arbitration proceeds to the merits.\n\nd.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe following sections will briefly summarize the facts giving rise to this dispute to the extent necessary to place the Parties' arguments on the Preliminary Objections in context. This summary is not intended to set out all of the facts as alleged by the Parties or all of the Parties' submissions.\n\n**A. T****he** **C****laimant****'****s** **A****lleged** **I****nvestment**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Claimant's primary position is that it \"directly owns and controls Skyway 127, a wind project located in the province of Ontario, Canada\",18 and that it had \"standing\" as an investor under the NAFTA when its claim first arose on 15 August 2015 because, at the time, it \"was effectively controlling Skyway 127, and it effectively owned 45.2% of the shares of Skyway 127.\"19\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 112.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 117.\n\n124.\n\nTo the extent that the Tribunal finds that the claim arose prior to 15 January 2015, when the Claimant allegedly acquired its 45.2% stake in Skyway 127, the Claimant maintains that it still \"has standing to bring a claim.\"20 In particular, the Claimant avers that it \"has standing to bring a claim regarding the period from April 26, 2011 to January 15, 2015\" as it owned and controlled \"a property right through its beneficial ownership of shares in Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc.\" that qualifies as a protected investment under the NAFTA.21\n\nReply, \u00b6 7(a).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 7(a). *See also* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 115-119.\n\n**1. The Alleged Beneficial Ownership in the Shares of Skyway 127**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nAs mentioned above, Skyway 127 was incorporated in Ontario, Canada on 18 October 2007.22 At the time of its constitution, Skyway 127 was 50% owned by I.Q. Properties Inc., a company with its address at 51 St. Lawrence St., ON L9Y 4Y3, Collingwood, Canada; 25 % owned by Mr. John C. Pennie; and 25% owned by Ms. Marilyn Field, both with their address at 3030 Concession Road 3 Adjala, ON L0N 1P0, Palgrave, Canada.23\n\nSkyway 127 - Certificate of Incorporation, 18 October 2007 (**C-113**).\n\nShareholders and Transfers Register, Skyway 127, 18 October 2007 (**C-140**).\n\n126.\n\nAccording to Messrs. John Pennie, John Tennant and Derek Tennant's witness testimony, on 19 April 2011, Mr. John Tennant \"agreed to allow the [437,500] Skyway 127 shares [that I.Q. Properties Inc. held at the time] to satisfy the debt\" of CAD 200,000 on which Mr. Derek Tennant had defaulted.24 Thereafter, on 26 April 2011, Mr. John Tennant \"confirmed with Derek that I would nominate Tennant Travel Services, LLC to hold the Skyway 127 shares\",25 and notified Mr. John C. Pennie, who was the corporate secretary of Skyway 127 at the time, that the shares should be transferred to Tennant Travel Services, LLC.26\n\nWitness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6 18 (**CWS-2**). *See also* Pennie Statement, \u00b6 47 (**CWS-1**); Witness Statement of Derek Tennant, \u00b6 16 (**CWS-3**).\n\nWitness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6 19 (**CWS-2**). *See also* Witness Statement of Derek Tennant, \u00b6 21 (**CWS-3**).\n\nWitness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6 20 (**CWS-2**); Pennie Statement, \u00b6 48 (**CWS-1**); Witness Statement of Derek Tennant, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24 (**CWS-3**).\n\n127.\n\nAccording to Skyway 127's shareholders and transfers register, on 20 June 2011, Tennant Travel Services, LLC did not hold any of its shares. Instead, Mr. John Tennant, with his address at 250 Greenfield Avenue, San Mateo, California, United States, held an 11.3% equity interest in Skyway 127.27 The remaining portion of Skyway 127's shares at that time was held by:\n\n(a) GE Energy, LLC (\"**GE Energy**\"), a company with its address at 1 River Road, Schenectady, New York 12345, United States (total of 50% of the shares);\n\n(b) Premier Renewable Energy, Ltd. (\"**Premier Renewable**\"), a company with its address at Fransestraat 2, 6524 JA Nijmegen, the Netherlands (total of 25% of the shares);\n\n(c) Ms. Marilyn Field (total of 5.6% of the shares);\n\n(d) Mr. J. C.

Pennie, however, this was only because Skyway 127 was very busy at the time with managing its wind energy project.31 The Claimant further maintains that Mr. John Tennant acquired his shares in Skyway 127 to be held in trust, and designated Tennant Energy as the beneficiary owner of its shares on 26 April 2011 and 31 December 2011, respectively.32\n\nSection VI.A.1. below.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.\n\nPennie Statement, \u00b6 47 (**CWS-1**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 84, 154.\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent, by contrast, contends that Mr. John Tennant acquired an 11.3% equity interest in Skyway 127 on the date recorded in the shareholders' ledger (*i.e.*, on 20 June 2011).33 Moreover, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove its beneficial ownership of up to 22.6% of the shares in Skyway 127.34\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 32.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 88.\n\n131.\n\nOn 15 January 2015, the Claimant acquired 45.2% of the shares in Skyway 127 from Mr. John Tennant, Ms. Marilyn Field and Mr. John Pennie.35\n\nShareholder's Ledger Skyway 127, 15 January 2015 (**C-115**).\n\n**2.

Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2013-22, Award, 27 September 2016, \u00b6 515 (**RLA-88**).\n\n**V. THE CLAIMANT'S CASE ON MERITS AND QUANTUM**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the Respondent breached Article 1105 of the NAFTA by failing to accord to Skyway 127 treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n164.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent's conduct in implementing and administering the FIT Program was wrongful. According to the Claimant:103\n\n\"13. The Tennant NAFTA Claim is about:\n\n(a) Special business opportunities provided to a politically connected local favourite, IPC.\n\n(b) The \"Breakfast Club\" cabal of politicians and senior officials systemically abusing the process to reward friends at the expense of everyone else.\n\n(c) Ontario's decision to not complete its FIT Program for the Bruce Region contrary to the legitimate expectation of FIT Proponents such as Skyway 127.\n\n(d) The delay of the award of contracts because of Korean Consortium's failure to comply with its contractual obligations.\n\n(e) The conspiracy in the systemic violations of the NAFTA and the spoliation and wanton destruction of evidence by Ontario.\"\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 13. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 89, 310, 717.\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimant claims damages as a result of the Respondent's alleged wrongful actions. The Deloitte Report assessed the midpoint value of damages to be not less than CAD 219,012,000, comprised of economic losses of CAD 184,012,000 (midpoint value) and the Claimant's claim for moral damages of CAD 35,000.104 The alleged economic losses were calculated to include: (a) the alleged lost profits that Tennant Energy would have earned from its project, had a FIT Contract been obtained; and (b) the alleged costs already incurred by Tennant Energy in relation to preparing the project for commercial operation.105 As regards moral damages, the Claimant avers that it is entitled to damages for the \"reputational, psychological, and emotional harm\" suffered by the corporate officials of Tennant Energy.106 In addition, the Claimant seeks arbitration and legal costs.107\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 31(d), 889.\n\nDeloitte Report (**CER-1**), \u00b6 4.2.4.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 894-899.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 900-903.\n\n**VI. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS ON JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nIn the following Section, the Tribunal summarizes the Parties' arguments with respect to (**A**) two preliminary considerations, namely whether Articles 1116(1) and 1116(2) of the NAFTA constitute jurisdictional or admissibility requirements, and which Party bears the burden of proof; (**B**) the Respondent's First Objection, namely, that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* under Article 1116(1) because the Claimant was not an \"investor of a Party\" when the alleged breach occurred; and (**C**) the Respondent's Second Objection, namely that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* because the Claimant failed to submit its claim within the three-year limitation period established by Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA.\n\n167.\n\nBoth the United States and Mexico made submissions on the interpretation of Article 1116 of the NAFTA, and in particular on the question whether the fulfilment of the requirements of Article 1116 is a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility. As such, sub-sections summarizing each of the non-disputing Parties' arguments in this respect, and the disputing Parties' responses thereto, follow the summaries of the Parties' arguments.\n\n**A. P****reliminary** **C****onsiderations**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent submits that compliance with Articles 1116(1) and 1116(2) of the NAFTA constitute jurisdictional requirements in respect of which the Claimant bears the burden of proof, as agreed by the non-disputing Parties.108\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 55-61; Rejoinder, \u00b6 12; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 5.\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent avers that, pursuant to Article 1122(1) of the NAFTA, its consent to arbitration is conditioned upon the fulfilment of the requirements imposed by the NAFTA, including those set forth in Articles 1116(1) and 1116(2).109 It follows, the Respondent asserts, that the assessment of its objections under Articles 1116(1) and 1116(2) are questions of jurisdiction.110 According to the Respondent, the former has been consistently recognized by NAFTA tribunals.111\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 55.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 55.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57; *Mesa Power Group, LLC v.

Mexico*, on which the Claimant relies, are not relevant to the question of whether Article 1116(2) raises admissibility or jurisdictional questions because neither of the tribunals ruled on that question.112 Moreover, the Respondent observes that, although the *TECMED v. Mexico* tribunal concluded that compliance with a time limitation to bring a claim was not a jurisdictional matter under the applicable treaty, such position is inconsistent with the one adopted by numerous subsequent NAFTA tribunals and the NAFTA Parties.113 In any event, the Respondent notes that, as the *Mobil v. Canada* tribunal held, regardless of whether an objection under Article 1116(2) is characterized as an issue of jurisdiction or admissibility, that \"the practical consequences are the same: if a claimant has failed to comply with the limitation period set out in Article 1116(2), then the case cannot proceed.\"114\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Canada*, that an objection under Article 1116(2) constitutes an \"affirmative defence\", should be disregarded as it has been discounted by numerous more recent decisions.118\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 58; Rejoinder, \u00b6 16; *Apotex Inc. v.

Czech Republic* tribunal, which held that for the establishment of its jurisdiction it must \"ascertain that the prerequisites for its jurisdiction are fulfilled, and that the facts on which its jurisdiction can be based are proven\".120 For this reason, in the Respondent's view, the Claimant's position that, absent evidence of bad faith, the Tribunal should defer to the Claimant's judgment about when its claim arose when assessing whether it complied with a jurisdictional requirement, is \"unsupported and incorrect\".121\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 16.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 23; *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v.

The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nWhile the Claimant similarly agrees that this distinction is ultimately not material as a practical matter, it maintains, contrary to the Respondent's position, that compliance with Articles 1116(1) and 1116(2) of the NAFTA constitute an admissibility requirement. In addition, specifically in relation to the Respondent's time bar objection, the Claimant considers that the Respondent bears the burden of proving it because it is an affirmative defence.\n\n174.\n\nThe Claimant first submits that \"the questions raised by Canada are fundamentally ones of admissibility rather than questions of jurisdiction\".122 With respect to the time limitation requirement in Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA, in particular, the Claimant observes that the tribunals in *Pope & Talbot v. Canada*, *Feldman v. Mexico* and *TECMED v. Mexico* adopted the same view.123 Nevertheless, the Claimant contends that as a practical matter, the \"Tribunal need not be overly concerned with this distinction as it might in other cases due to the sufficiency of evidence produced by Tennant Energy with respect to standing, and due to the absence of responsive evidence adduced by Canada on the issue of its affirmative defence on timing.\"124\n\nReply, \u00b6 183.\n\nReply, \u00b6 214, *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Canada incorrectly suggests that they are the same.\"126 In fact, the Claimant asserts, not only has the Respondent admitted that it bears the burden of proving its time bar objection,127 but this position is also consistent with Article 24(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which provides that \"[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support its claim or defence.\"128 The Claimant further relies on the *Pope & Talbot v. Canada* tribunal's holding that it is for \"Respondent States to bear 'the burden of proof of showing [a] factual predicate' to 'an affirmative defense\".129\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 191.\n\nReply, \u00b6 263.\n\nReply, \u00b6 259; Respondent's Response to Claimant's Request for Interim Measures, 23 September 2019, \u00b6 6.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 191.\n\nReply, \u00b6 192, *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

The Non-Disputing Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Submissions of the United States and Mexico**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe non-disputing Parties agree with the Respondent's submission that the requirements set forth in Article 1116 are matters of jurisdiction.130\n\nUnited States' Second Submission, \u00b6 3; Mexico's Second Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\n177.\n\nWith respect to consent to arbitration, Mexico, relying on *Methanex v. United States*, \"concurs with Canada that fulfillment of Article 1116's requirements is one of the conditions that must be met to establish a NAFTA Party's consent\" contained in Article 1122(1).131 Thus, Mexico affirms that \"[f]ailure to comply with Article 1122(1) results in the absence of a NAFTA Party's consent and thus, in the tribunal's lack of jurisdiction.\"132\n\nMexico's Second Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4, *referring to* *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, \u00b6 120 (**RLA-2**).\n\nMexico's Second Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\n178.\n\nLikewise, the United States submits that \"a tribunal must find that a claim satisfied the requirements of, *inter alia*, Article 1116 in order to establish a Party's consent to (and therefore the tribunal's jurisdiction over) an arbitration claim.\"133\n\nUnited States' Second Submission, \u00b6 3.\n\n179.\n\nAs to the burden of proof, the non-disputing Parties agree that a claimant bears the burden of proving the factual elements necessary to establish the tribunal's jurisdiction and the fulfilment of the specific legal requirements, including that each of its claims falls within the three-year limitations period provided in Article 1116(2).134 This view, according to Mexico, is shared by all three NAFTA Parties and has been confirmed by NAFTA tribunals.135\n\nUnited States' Second Submission, \u00b6 3; Mexico's Second Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 13.\n\nMexico's Second Submission, \u00b6 13, *referring to* *Resolute Forest Products Inc. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 January 2018, \u00b6 85 (**RLA-79**).\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Reply to the Submissions of the Non-Disputing Parties**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Respondent submits that concordant views expressed by the NAFTA Parties in their non-disputing Party submissions regarding the interpretation of their obligations constitute subsequent agreement and practice within the meaning of Article 31(3) of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**VCLT**\").136 Accordingly, the Respondent contends that, in line with other NAFTA tribunals, the Tribunal should give considerable weight to the \"longstanding interpretation of Article 1116 that has been consistently maintained by all three NAFTA Parties\".137\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 11.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that the NAFTA Parties \u2013 as demonstrated in the Mexican and United States' submissions \u2013 have consistently advanced the same position with respect to the burden of proof under Article 1116, namely that a claimant bears the burden of proving the factual elements necessary to establish jurisdiction.138 This position, the Respondent continues, has been recognized and accepted by numerous NAFTA tribunals.139\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b610.\n\n182.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Respondent highlights that both Mexico and the United States agree with the Respondent that the fulfilment of the requirements of Article 1116 is one of the conditions that must be met to establish a NAFTA Party's consent to arbitration and, in turn, to establish a tribunal's jurisdiction.140\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\n**(c) The Claimant's Reply to the Submissions of the Non-Disputing Parties**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nDisagreeing with the non-disputing Parties' submissions, the Claimant reiterates that \"the issue of time is best considered as an admissibility issue rather than as a jurisdictional one.\"141 Accordingly, the Claimant takes the view that the burden of proof rests on the party advancing the admissibility the argument \u2013 the Respondent.142 The Claimant further contests the Respondent's and the non-disputing Parties' assertions that the interpretations by the NAFTA Parties in the form of written pleadings are sufficient to constitute subsequent practice under VCLT.143\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 9.\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 9.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 151-153. *See* Claimant's First Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 42-44, *referring to* Martins Paparinskis*, The International Minimum Standard of Treatment and Equitable Treatment* (Oxford University Press, First Edition, 2013), pp. 144-146 (**CLA-97**).\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimant further objects to the non-disputing Parties' position that \"the matter at hand is not properly one of consent\".144 Instead, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has given its consent to this arbitration in Article 1122(1) and that, contrary to Mexico's contention, such admission of consent meets any burden of proof.145\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\n**B. T****he** **F****irst** **O****bjection**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* under Article 1116(1) because the Claimant was not an \"investor of a Party\" when the alleged breach occurred. Article 1116(1) provides:\n\n\"1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:\n\n(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or\n\n(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Section A, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\"\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimant, on the other hand, contends that it has standing to submit the claims at issue in this arbitration pursuant to Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA as it was an \"investor of a Party\" when the alleged breaches occurred. On this basis, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal dismiss the First Objection.\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) Interpretation of Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent advances two interpretative considerations for the assessment of the First Objection.146 First, the Respondent submits that claims submitted by a claimant on its own behalf under Article 1116(1), such as those that have been brought by the Claimant, may only be brought by an \"investor of a Party\" that qualified as such at the time the alleged breach occurred.147\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 62-79.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 67.\n\n188.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the term \"investor of a Party\" in Article 1116(1) should be read together with Articles 1101(1) and 1139 of the NAFTA.148 Article 1101(1) establishes that Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA applies to measures of a Contracting Party relating to, *inter alia*, (a) investors of another Party; or (b) investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party.149 Article 1139 of the NAFTA, in turn, defines \"investor of a Party\" as \"a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment;\" and \"investment of an investor of a Party\" as \"an investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of such Party\".150 Having regard to these provisions, the Respondent concludes that \"[t]he proper interpretation of the term 'investor of a Party', as it operates within Article 1116(1), is that a tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* is limited to claims submitted by a claimant who qualified as an 'investor of a Party' when the alleged breach occurred\".151\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 65-67; Rejoinder, \u00b6 28.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 65.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 66.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 67.\n\n189.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent maintains that scholars and investment treaty tribunals, including tribunals established under the NAFTA, agree that, for a tribunal to have temporal jurisdiction, a claimant must be a protected investor under the treaty when the alleged breach occurred.152 The Respondent notes that in reaching that conclusion some tribunals have referred to the principle of non-retroactivity of international treaties, pursuant to which \"State conduct cannot be governed by rules that are not applicable when the conduct occurs\".153 According to the Respondent, NAFTA tribunals similarly have considered provisions such as Article 1116(1) and Article 1101(1) to be consistent with the principle of non-retroactivity.154 For instance, the *Mesa Power* tribunal held that it lacked jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over certain measures that occurred before the claimant's enterprises were incorporated in Canada, and thus, before it became a protected investor with respect to those investments.155 In this respect, the Respondent underlines that the *Mesa Power* tribunal, referring to Article 1101(1), found that there is no jurisdiction if disputed measures are not \"relating to investors\" or to \"investments of an investor.\"156\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 68-74; Rejoinder, \u00b6 28; *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v.

Canada*, a case brought under the NAFTA, the Respondent points out that the tribunal declined jurisdiction as it deemed \"unconceivable that the [c]laimant, after extensive discovery, ha[d] not been able to produce one single shred of documentary evidence, confirming the date when Mr. Gallo acquired ownership\".162 The Respondent emphasizes that, in that case, Mr. Gallo only relied on the testimony of a witness to prove his ownership and control over the investment at issue.163\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 75-79; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 34-38; *Vito G.

It is a special case of assignment that arises where the investor has received an indemnity under an insurance claim. Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 21 and fn. 45; United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA), 1 July 2020, Chapter 14-Investment, Art. 14.15 (**CLA-294**).\n\n194.\n\nFor the Respondent, permitting an investment claim under NAFTA to be assigned from one investor to another poses several risks: (a) NAFTA Parties may face duplicative domestic and international proceedings over the same alleged breach from the assignor and assignee, rendering the waiver provision in Article 1121(1)(b) meaningless; (b) it would incentivize claim shopping; (c) it would create significant uncertainty to NAFTA Parties with no predictability as to the scope of potential claimants; and (d) it would create leeway for investors to avoid personal liability for adverse costs orders.169\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 22.\n\n195.\n\nThe Respondent considers the cases cited by the Claimant inapposite because none of the tribunals found that a different investor or a \"successor in interest\" can initiate a claim about events that predated its acquisition of the investment, or that a claimant bringing a NAFTA claim need not be a protected investor when the alleged breach occurred.170 The Respondent adds that inter-State cases are also irrelevant since the right of the States to bring claims under international law procedures of diplomatic protection are distinct from those of an investor to bring a claim under the NAFTA.171\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 24; *Daimler Financial Services AG v.

The Claimant Was Not an \"investor of a Party\" When the Alleged Breach Occurred*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nIn connection with the date on which the Claimant qualified as an \"investor of a Party\", the Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of establishing that it owned or controlled its purported investment when the alleged breaches occurred.192 In this respect, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's assertions that (a) it was the \"successor[] in interest\" to the shares held by Mr. John Tennant either as the designated beneficiary of an oral trust in April 2011 or by way of an assignment of NAFTA claims; and (b) it controlled its investment accordance with NAFTA case law.193 Instead, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant became an \"investor of a Party\" at the earliest on 15 January 2015, when the Claimant acquired 45.2% equity interest in Skyway 127,194 as supported by Skyway 127's shareholder's ledger.195\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 86-96.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 90; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 42. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 87; Shareholder's Ledger Skyway 127, 15 January 2015 (**C-115**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 90; Shareholder's Ledger Skyway 127, 15 January 2015 (**C-115**).\n\n*(1) The Claimant failed to establish that it owned its investment when the alleged breach occurred*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant's \"alternative theories\" that it owned intangible property rights in the form of beneficial rights in up to 22.6% of the Skyway 127 shares by way of an oral trust and/or by way of a transfer of NAFTA claims are \"incorrect, unsupported, and do not establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction\".196\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 8.\n\n206.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's theory of an oral trust, the Respondent argues that the available evidence does not meet the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard \u2013 a high evidentiary threshold \u2013 to prove its existence under California law and that the Claimant, as a result, failed to prove that it was a protected investor under NAFTA before the alleged breach occurred on 4 July 2011.197 Specifically, given the absence of any contemporaneous documentary evidence to prove that Mr. John Tennant created the alleged trust, put the Skyway 127 shares in it, or designated Tennant Travel as the beneficiary, the Respondent contends that \"[t]he available evidence is not strong enough to conclude that every reasonable person would agree that the alleged oral trust existed, as California law requires\", as concluded by Ms. Lodise.198\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 88; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 43; California Probate Code, Division 9 \u2013 Trust Law [15000-19530], Enacted by Stats. 1990, Ch. 79 [Excerpt], \u00a7 15207 (**R-90**); Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 5, 729:1-19.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 56; Lodise Report \u00b6 50 (**RER-1**). *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43; Lodise Report \u00b6\u00b6 32, 36-37 (**RER-1**).\n\n207.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that the documents that the Claimant has submitted in support of its alleged beneficial ownership of Skyway 127 do not constitute reliable, contemporaneous documentary evidence necessary to prove that it acquired the investment through an oral trust.199 These documents, in particular, comprise: the respective witness statements of Messrs. John Tennant, Derek Tennant and John Pennie and a memorandum from Mr. John Tennant to the Claimant's management board dated 8 February 2016.200\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 39-41; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 31.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 39; Memorandum from John Tennant to Tennant Energy regarding Trust transfer and successor in interest, 8 February 2016 (**C-268**).\n\n208.\n\nAddressing the witness statements, the Respondent argues that they should be given \"no weight\".201 This is because, the Respondent explains, Messrs. John Tennant and Derek Tennant, as members of the Claimant's management board, and Mr. Pennie, as a senior executive for the Claimant, all have a personal interest in this arbitration.202 The Respondent asserts that this is further reinforced by the fact that Mr. Derek Tennant is also the President of Skyway 127.203 In addition, the Respondent argues that Mr. Derek Tennant's and Mr. Pennie's statements on what Mr. John Tennant told them are merely \"hearsay\".204 Thus, the Respondent contends that absent any reliable, contemporaneous documentary evidence to verify independently these witnesses' assertions, their witness statements are insufficient to prove the Claimant's alleged ownership rights, as observed by the tribunal in *MAKAE Europe v. Saudi Arabia*.205\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 89; Rejoinder, \u00b6 40.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 40; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 89; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 34; Witness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6 3 (**CWS-2**); Witness Statement of Derek Tennant, \u00b6 2 (**CWS-3**); Pennie Statement, \u00b6 68 (**CWS-1**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 40; Witness Statement of Derek Tennant, \u00b6 2 (**CWS-3**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 89; Rejoinder, \u00b6 40; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 34.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 89; Rejoinder, \u00b6 40; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 1, 33:21-35:1; *MAKAE Europe SARL v.

According to the Respondent, the witnesses testified that the trust was created for four different purposes: (a) to avoid a community property dispute; (b) to prevent the dilution of voting control; (c) to avoid taxes; and (d) to maintain continuity of control over the shares. *See* Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 2, 249:21-25; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 382:18-25-383:1-18, 384:3-6, 469:2-5.\n\n210.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondent asserts that Mr. John Tennant's narrative regarding the creation of the alleged trust is unconvincing and unreliable.209 Drawing the Tribunal's attention to the following issues relating to Mr. John Tennant's witness testimony, the Respondent notes that:\n\n(a) Mr. Tennant first acquired shares in Skyway 127 because such shares served as a collateral for a loan to Mr. Derek Tennant for $200,000.210 Given the value of the loan, it is incongruous that Mr. John Tennant documented all matters concerning the loan and yet did nothing to document the alleged transfer of the shares into the alleged trust.211\n\n(b) Mr. Tennant's allegation that the Claimant served as a holding company for his shares in Skyway 127 is at odds with the lack of any documentary evidence on the record showing his ownership over the Claimant when the alleged breach occurred.212 In any event, the Respondent points out that Mr. Tennant could not explain the reason for creating a trust when he had already told Mr. John Pennie to transfer ownership of shares to the holding company that he would designate in the future.213\n\n(c) Mr. John Tennant's assertion that he never owned shares in Skyway 127 for his personal benefit is not supported by any explanation as to why he allegedly relinquished his beneficial ownership in these shares.214 The Respondent avers that this assertion \"means, in effect, that he received nothing in return for his $200,000 loan to Derek Tennant\".215\n\n(d) Mr. John Tennant's allegation that, at Mr. Derek Tennant's request, he intended to hold the Skyway 127 shares in a holding company so they could avoid any community property dispute is implausible.216 Relying on the Lodise Report, the Respondent contends that if the trust was created to prevent Mr. John Tennant's spouse to access such shares, preserve continuity of legal ownership over shares and prevent dilution of voting control, the trust would be invalid under California law for violating public policy.217 In any event, the Respondent contends that the use of the alleged trust as an \"asset protection device\" without ensuring documentation certifying the trust is untenable.218\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 48-53.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 48.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 33; John Tennant Bank Statements with copies of cashed checks to Derek Tennant, September 2007 (**C-264**); Promissory Note between I.Q.

John Tennant and Derek Tennant admitted during the Hearing on Jurisdiction that they had no contemporaneous documentation on certain key events to corroborate the existence or terms of the alleged oral trust.219 Considering that all of the events from April 2011 \u2013 the point in time which the Claimant asserts it became a protected investor \u2013 are based merely on oral assertions, the absence of any contemporaneous documentation on the alleged trust, for the Respondent, strongly indicates that Mr. John Tennant never created the trust and that the Claimant never acquired the Skyway 127 shares at that time.220\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 32; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 365:2-366:10, 372:7-19, 377:4-24, 378:22-379:7, 379:8-15, 414:17-415:10, 441:3-7, 446:3-22.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\n212.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, Mr. John Tennant's 8 February 2016 memorandum \u2013 the sole exhibit the Claimant filed in attempt to prove the existence of the trust \u2013 likewise does not constitute reliable evidence because it was created over a year after the trust was purportedly terminated, after the alleged breach occurred, and around the same time the Claimant's counsel was \"taking steps\" to prepare the claims in this arbitration (*i.e.*, on 16 March 2015).221 According to the Respondent, this document \"is exactly the type of non-contemporaneous material prepared in contemplation of arbitration that tribunals have found unreliable.\"222\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 41; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 40; Memorandum from John Tennant to Tennant Energy regarding Trust transfer and successor in interest, 8 February 2016 (**C-268**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 41; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 40; *Vito G.

John Tennant and Derek Tennant that Tennant Travel did not otherwise hold the rights to direct the actions of Skyway 127.245 Moreover, the Respondent notes that the alleged \"voting bloc\" only held 45.2% of the shares of Skyway 127, and therefore could not confer control of Skyway 127 under Ontario law.246 In any event, the Respondent argues that the Claimant fails to submit any evidence (a) of this \"voting bloc\", (b) that this change in the control over the company was notified to the OPA, as required under the FIT Rules, (c) that GE Energy, which held 50% of the Skyway 127 shares at the time of the alleged breach, did not exercise its voting rights, or (d) of the United States nationality of the three \"active shareholders\", which would be required to establish foreign control by the alleged \"voting bloc\".247\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 60.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 60.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 49; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 465:13-466:1.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 61; Ontario Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.

In any event, the Respondent asserts that day-to-day operational management of an enterprise does not, on its own, establish control of the enterprise. *See* Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 47; *Philip Morris Asia Limited v. Commonwealth of Australia,* PCA Case No. 2012-12, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 17 December 2015, \u00b6 497 (**RLA-141**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 95.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 95.\n\n224.\n\nAddressing the Claimant's argument that the Tribunal could still find jurisdiction because Mr. John Tennant owned both the Skyway 127 shares and 90% of the Claimant when the alleged breach occurred, the Respondent argues that the decision in *S.D. Myers v. Canada* is not helpful in this regard.251 This is because, according to the Respondent, the *S.D. Myers* tribunal offered no reasoning or interpretative guidance under NAFTA Article 1116(1) or international law as to how a claimant's corporate veil can be pierced to find jurisdiction based on whether its owners were protected investors at the time of the alleged breach.252\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 10; *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 November 2000, \u00b6 229 (**CLA-111**).\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\n225.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that nothing in the terms of the Treaty reflects the NAFTA Parties' intention to authorize tribunals to \"suspend separate personality [of corporations] to find jurisdiction\".253 According to the Respondent, the term \"indirectly\", in referring to ownership or control in the definition of \"investment of an investor of a Party\", only allows a tribunal to look down the corporate chain to determine if the claimant owned or controlled the investment via intermediaries it owned or controlled.254 For the Respondent, this does not mean that a claimant's veil can be pierced by looking up the corporate chain to determine if the claimant's owners owned or controlled the investment at the requisite times.255 Consequently, the Respondent takes the view that the Federal Court, in finding that the claimant qualified as an investor, also \"improperly pierced the veil of the claimant\".256\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 13.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 14.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 14. *See also* Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 5, 713:2-13, 713:20-25, 714:8-715:6.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 15; *Canada (Attorney General) v. S.D. Myers Inc.*, 2004 FC 38, \u00b6\u00b6 64, 67 (**R-80**).\n\n226.\n\nIn fact, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has submitted \"none of the evidence considered relevant by the tribunal or reviewing Federal Court in *S.D. Myers v. Canada* to show[] a claimant's control over an investment enterprise.\"257 This includes evidence that Tennant Travel advanced the money necessary for the operation of Skyway 127, or provided Skyway 127 with loans, technical assistance, personnel, or other forms of support, when the alleged breach occurred.258 The Respondent further highlights that no reliable evidence has been filed to support Mr. John Tennant's 90% ownership of the Claimant from 2011 to 2015 or the majority ownership of Skyway 127 by the Tennant family when the alleged breach occurred.259\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 96; *Canada (Attorney General) v.

The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) Interpretation of Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nIn interpreting Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA, the Claimant agrees with the Respondent that reference must first be made to Article 1139, which defines \"investor of a Party\".261 Noting that this definition is \"broad\",262 the Claimant asserts that it encompasses \"an enterprise of [a] Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment.\"263 Article 1139, in turn, and by reference to Article 201 of the NAFTA, defines an \"enterprise of a Party\" as \"an enterprise constituted or organized under the law of a Party, and a branch located in the territory of a Party and carrying out business activities there\",264 and an \"enterprise\" as \"any entity constituted or organized under applicable law, whether or not for profit, and whether privately-owned or governmentally-owned, including any corporation, trust, partnership, sole proprietorship, joint venture or other association\".265\n\nReply, \u00b6 91.\n\nReply, \u00b6 118.\n\nReply, \u00b6 91.\n\nReply, \u00b6 92.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.\n\n229.\n\nFurther to the above, the Claimant advances two interpretative considerations with respect to Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA, only the second of which the Respondent appears to contest. First, the Claimant submits that beneficial interests in a company constitute intangible property rights protected as \"investments\" under Article 1139(g) of the NAFTA266 and that accordingly, a trust created in accordance with the laws of one of the NAFTA Parties qualifies as an \"Enterprise of a Party\" under Article 1139 of the NAFTA.267\n\nReply, \u00b6 117.\n\nReply, \u00b6 93.\n\n230.\n\nIn support of this position, the Claimant states that the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1139 covers in its paragraph (g) \"property, tangible or intangible acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit\".268 \"[I]ntangible property\", in the Claimant's view, is a \"very broad term\", which includes beneficial rights held by a trust as well as intangible property interests acquired in the expectation of economic benefit.269\n\nReply, \u00b6 116.\n\nReply, \u00b6 116-117.\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that general international law recognizes the right of a beneficial owner to submit claims to international arbitration, in some instances even to the exclusion of the holders of a legal title.270 The Claimant maintains that this proposition has been acknowledged by the tribunals in *Mason Capital v. Korea* and *Blue Bank v. Venezuela* as well as in the *ad hoc* annulment committee in *Occidental v. Ecuador*.271\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 97-103.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 98-102; *Mason Capital L.P. and Mason Management LLC v.

United States* in which the tribunal, according to the Claimant, expressly confirmed the legitimacy of transfer of NAFTA claims under Article 1109 as long as there is no change in the claimant's nationality.279 Other international tribunals and authorities, the Claimant asserts, have recognized and accepted the transfer of claims and the successors in interest pursuing those claims.280\n\nResponse to the Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 51.\n\nReply, \u00b6 104; Claimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 93-94; Response to the Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 14-20; *The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.

John Pennie, Derek Tennant and John Tennant; (b) a memorandum sent by Mr. John Tennant to the Claimant's management dated 8 February 2016; and (b) the Grignon Report.295\n\nReply, \u00b6 127.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 128-135.\n\n242.\n\nThe Claimant first points to the testimony of Mr. Pennie who \"can offer the best evidence about the treatment of the [Skyway 127] shares by [the Claimant]\" because he is a member of the Claimant's board of directors and its corporate representative.296 In his witness statement, the Claimant notes, Mr. Pennie \"confirmed that\" Tennant Energy received the shares in trust from Mr. John Tennant, who held the shares as a bare trustee.297 Likewise, Mr. Derek Tennant, the President of Skyway 127, asserted in his witness statement that he was aware that the shares obtained by Mr. John Tennant on 19 April 2011 were held for a company incorporated in the United States to be designated in future in trust.298 As for the testimony of Mr. John Tennant, the Claimant submits that he corroborated that on 26 April 2011 he informed Messrs. Derek Tennant and John Pennie that the Skyway 127 shares he acquired on 19 April 2011 in trust should be for the benefit of the Claimant.299 He further testifies, the Claimant notes, that on 8 February 2016 he sent a memorandum to the Claimant in which he made specific reference to the Skyway 127 shares as being held in trust in favour of Tennant Energy.300\n\nReply, \u00b6 127.\n\nReply, \u00b6 128;

Grignon Report, \u00b6 28 (**CER-2**).\n\n246.\n\nAs explained by Justice Grignon, the Claimant submits that an oral trust was created under California law when (a) the trustee Mr. John Tennant resided in the State of California between 2007 and 2015; (b) Mr. John Tennant declared on 19 April 2011 that he would be holding the Skyway 127 shares in a trust for a holding company; (c) he identified the holding company and the beneficiary of the trust as Tennant Travel on 26 April 2011; and (d) the purpose of the trust was to hold shares for the benefit of a company to prevent dilution of voting control.306 According to the Claimant, it is not necessary under California law to name a specific beneficiary as long as there is an identifiable class of beneficiaries \u2013 in this case, a holding company that Mr. John Tennant would designate in the future.307 In addition, the Claimant considers irrelevant the fact that the shares themselves were not shown as transferred on the corporate records until later because it is not disputed that either the company shares or simply the right to those shares can constitute trust property under California law.308\n\nReply, \u00b6 82-85;

completely consistent evidence is not required.312 As to the Respondent's argument on the lack of contemporaneous documents, the Claimant argues that, as opined by Ms. Lodise, \"there does not have to be contemporaneous writing to proven an oral trust\" under California law.313\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6 71.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 72-73;

There is also no conflicting testimony that actually denies the declaration of the trust by Mr. John Tennant.314 Indeed, the Claimant highlights Ms. Lodise's concession that the testimony of Messrs. Derek Tennant and John Pennie could be considered corroboration of the existence of the trust under California law.315 As such, the Claimant takes the view that there is sufficient evidence from witness testimony and surrounding evidence to satisfy the clear and convincing standard as applied in California.316 It therefore argues that Tennant Travel, as the holding company, held an intangible property interest in the Skyway 127 shares as an equitable interest as of 26 April 2011.317\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6 65.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6 65; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 4, 657:13-18.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6 75.\n\nReply, \u00b6 85; Claimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70; Grignon Report, \u00b6 35 (**CER-2**); Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 4, 535:19-25, 626:9-24. *See also* Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 4, 626:13-15, 626:22-24.\n\n250.\n\nAlternatively, even assuming *arguendo* that no oral trust was created, the Claimant submits that it is the successor in interest to the Skyway 127 shares held by Mr. Tennant, including all rights affixed to the shares, by obtaining legal title to the shares through a transfer that occurred in 15 January 2015.318 This transfer of shares, the Claimant continues, \"automatically became the assignment and legally transferred the intangible rights\" originally held by Mr. John Tennant, including any chose of action that he would have as a shareholder.319 Moreover, the Claimant notes that the transfer occurred more than two years before 1 June 2017 (*i.e.*, the date of the making of its claim) and earlier than the date of the discovery by Mr. John Pennie in August 2015 with respect to the Respondent's breaches of its NAFTA obligations.320\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 76-78, 96-97; Response to the Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 77-80, 83.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 5, 819:5-7, 839:12-17.\n\nResponse to the Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 80.\n\n251.\n\nAdditionally, as opined by Justice Grignon, the Claimant maintains that it was not necessary to assign separately any \"choses in action\", including the rights under the NAFTA that Mr. John Tennant had at the time of the assignment, along with the shares, because \"whatever rights he had as a shareholder, whether it's as trustee or as a shareholder\" were \"automatically\" conveyed with the shares as a matter of California law.321 The Claimant stresses that the Respondent has filed no contrasting expert testimony in this regard.322\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6 53, 83; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 5, 816:17-20. *See also* Response to the Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 72.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6 78. *See also* Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 4, 611:22-25.\n\n252.\n\nHaving put forward its arguments regarding the existence and validity of the shares it beneficially owned through Mr. John Tennant, the Claimant submits that such rights constitute intangible property acquired in the expectation of economic benefit under Article 1139(g) of the NAFTA.323 Thus, the Claimant maintains that the rights it held in respect of Skyway 127 from 26 April 2011 to 15 January 2015 fall within the sphere of protected investments under the NAFTA.324\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 116-117.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 116-117.\n\n253.\n\nAlthough, in its view, the determination of its ownership over Skyway 127 is sufficient to conclude that it has standing under Article 1116, the Claimant avers that it also exercised control over its investment.325 The Claimant asserts that Mr. John Tennant, following his decision to hold his shares in trust in favour of the Claimant, \"reached an agreement with other shareholders that he would get the last word in the voting bloc.\"326\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 141-169.\n\nReply, \u00b6 149; Witness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6 25 (**CWS-2**).\n\n254.\n\nThe Claimant specifies that it had effective voting control of Skyway 127 as of 31 December 2011, when Mr. John Tennant increased his shareholding in the company from 11.3% to 22.6% and informed Messrs. John Pennie and Derek Tennant that \"the trust would continue to vote the shares with Derek and John Pennie to control the company\".327 According to the Claimant, although GE Energy held 50% of the shares of Skyway 127, it never exercised its voting rights.328 It follows, the Claimant asserts, that \"the control went to those who wished to vote, and to those who showed up to vote\".329 In support of this position, the Claimant further relies on Mr. Pennie's witness testimony, who states that Mr. \"John Tennant as Trustee controlled Skyway 127\".330\n\nReply, \u00b6 154.\n\nReply, \u00b6 166.\n\nReply, \u00b6 166.\n\nReply, \u00b6 145; Pennie Statement, \u00b6 48 (**CWS-1**).\n\n255.\n\nThe Claimant considers the definition of \"control\" under Ontario law irrelevant for the purposes of interpreting the NAFTA because, in its view, the terms of the Treaty should be interpreted in accordance with applicable rules of international law, as required by Article 1131(1) of the Treaty, in particular, when the text of the Treaty does not impose any local law requirements in defining the terms.331 The Claimant notes that the Federal Court of Canada in the *S.D. Myers* case reached the same conclusion.332 Therefore, it is the Claimant's view that the ordinary term \"control\" requires \"the ability to get one's own way\" under the circumstances, but does not depend upon 50.1% shareholding.333\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 127-134; Response to the Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 65.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6135-136; *Canada (Attorney General) v.

Myers* case is highly relevant in understanding an investor's \"control\" of an investment made by a family corporation.334 Specifically, the Claimant highlights that the *S.D. Myers* tribunal took broad steps to preserve an otherwise meritorious claim affected by a problematic corporate structure, after considering the objectives of the Treaty to protect all forms of economic activity that resulted in the holding of investments and the sufficiency of circumstances regarding the investment.335 The correctness of these jurisdictional findings by the *S.D. Myers* tribunal, the Claimant continues, was confirmed by the Federal Court in its judicial review.336\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 99, 122.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 102-111; *S.D.

In this respect, the basic *raison d'\u00eatre* of Skyway 127, the Claimant notes, was to promote and serve the interests of Tennant Energy.341\n\n(e) Tennant Energy and Skyway 127 were affiliated companies with common control, just as S.D.

The Alleged Breaches Occurred in August 2015*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nAs explained above,343 the Claimant's position is that the alleged breaches at stake in this arbitration took place in August 2015, when it first became aware or could have been aware of the Respondent's internationally wrongful acts.344 The Claimant further asserts that because its claims challenge composite acts that involve the concealment of wrongful acts, the alleged breach should be deemed to have occurred \"when the victim discovered the wrong\".345\n\n*See* \u00b6 235 above.\n\nReply, \u00b6 171.\n\nReply, \u00b6 271.\n\n259.\n\nAs will be detailed below (*see* section VI.C.2(b) below), the Claimant contends that it was only after August 2015, when the post-hearing written submissions and other materials related to the hearing in *Mesa Power* were made available to the public, that it became possible to acquire knowledge of the core facts underlying its claims.346 In support of its claim that it did not know of the alleged breaches before August 2015, the Claimant cites to the witness statement of Mr. John Pennie.347\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 173-175.\n\nReply, \u00b6 172; Pennie Statement, \u00b6 50 (**CWS-1**).\n\n260.\n\nNotwithstanding this, the Claimant submits that even if the Tribunal concluded that the breaches occurred when the Claimant was placed on a FIT priority waiting list (*i.e.*, on 4 July 2011) or when the FIT Program was terminated (*i.e.*, on 12 June 2013) the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction because these events occurred after the Claimant became an \"investor of a Party\" on 26 April 2011.348\n\nReply, \u00b6 137.\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimant therefore concludes that it owned and controlled its investment in Skyway 127 regardless of when the Tribunal determines the alleged breaches to have taken place, and, as a result, it has standing to bring the claims at issue in this arbitration under Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA.349\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 134, 176.\n\n**3. The Non-Disputing Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Submissions of Mexico and the United States**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe non-disputing Parties agree that a claimant must prove that it was an \"investor of a Party\" when the alleged breach occurred to establish jurisdiction under Article 1116(1).350\n\nUnited States' Second Submission, \u00b6 11; Mexico's Second Submission, \u00b6 6.\n\n263.\n\nAccording to Mexico, no obligation is owed to a claimant in the absence of a threshold connection between a claimant bringing the claim and the challenged measure under Section A of Chapter Eleven.351 As such, Mexico agrees with the Respondent that Articles 1101(1) and 1116(1) set a temporal limitation on a NAFTA tribunal's jurisdiction, requiring the existence of an investor of a Party at the time of the alleged breach.352\n\nMexico's Second Submission, \u00b6 7.\n\nMexico's Second Submission, \u00b6 6.\n\n264.\n\nSimilarly, the United States points out that the terms \"the investor\" and \"that breach\", in Article 1116(1) require that the investor bringing the claim be the same investor who suffered loss or damage as a result of the alleged breach.353 To the contrary, nothing in Chapter Eleven, the United States asserts, authorizes an investor to bring a claim for an alleged breach relating to a different investor.354\n\nUnited States' Second Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\nUnited States' Second Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\n265.\n\nAccording to the United States, the waiver provision in Article 1121(1)(b) offers context for interpreting Article 1116(1).355 The waiver provision, the United States explains, ensures that a NAFTA respondent need not litigate concurrent and overlapping proceedings in multiple forums relating to the same alleged breach.356 The United States warns that if Article 1116(a) was interpreted as to allow an investor, who is different from the investor who had made the investment at the time of the alleged breach, to bring a claim, respondents might be subject to domestic and international proceedings with respect to the same alleged breach, rendering the waiver provision meaningless.357\n\nUnited States' Second Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\nUnited States' Second Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\nUnited States' Second Submission, \u00b6 15.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Reply to the Submissions of the Non-Disputing Parties**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Mexico \"correctly notes that the requisite connection between a claimant and a challenged measure under Section A cannot be met until the claimant became a protected investor\".358 Therefore, the Respondent reiterates that an investor can establish jurisdiction for a claim under Article 1116(1) only if it was an investor of a Party who suffered the loss or damage as a result of the alleged breach.359 As observed by the United States, the Respondent asserts that a different interpretation of Article 1116(1) would render the waiver provision in Article 1121(1)(b) meaningless and \"incentivize claim shopping\".360\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 13.\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 15. The Respondent notes that Mexico has advanced the same position in other NAFTA proceedings. *See* Respondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 15, fn. 29.\n\n267.\n\nIn addition to the NAFTA Parties' agreement on the interpretation of Article 1116(1), to which, according to the Respondent, the Tribunal should give considerable weight, the Respondent highlights that NAFTA tribunals have consistently required a claimant to prove that it was a protected investor with a protected investment when the alleged breach occurred to establish a tribunal's jurisdiction.361 According to the Respondent, the Claimant \"appears to accept this rule, as it has not challenged Canada's interpretation of Article 1116(1) concerning jurisdiction *ratione temporis* in its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction or Reply on Jurisdiction\".362\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 16.\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 16.\n\n**(c) The Claimant's Reply to the Submissions of the Non-Disputing Parties**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with the non-disputing Parties that an investor bringing a claim must be the same party as the party who suffered the alleged breach.363 According to the Claimant, this \"highly restrictive approach\" advanced by the non-disputing Parties would leave \"meritorious successors in interest to victims without access to impartial and fair dispute settlement\".364 In this respect, the Claimant notes that the concept of the successor in interest pursuing treaty claims is well established under international law.365\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 17; *Isaiah v. Bank Mellat*, 2 IRAN-U.S. C.T.R., 30 March 1983, pp. 232, 249-252 (**CLA-321**); *The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 January 2004 (**CLA-333**).\n\n269.\n\nFor the Claimant, the United States' observations on the application of the context to Article 1116 are overly narrow.366 Instead, the Claimant argues that the context for the \"broad\" definitions of an \"enterprise\" in Article 201 and \"investment\" in Article 1139 must be read in light of the full NAFTA Treaty and not just the specific chapters contained therein.367 Therefore, the Claimant submits that this \"broad context is relevant when considering the associated requirements for an investor and an investment, such as the element of control\" and that past NAFTA cases are helpful in understanding the term \"owns or controls\" in Article 1139.368\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, fn. 6.\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 19.\n\n270.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[t]he date of the NAFTA breach was not earlier than August 15, 2015\" and the Respondent does not dispute that by 15 August 2015, Tennant Energy owned shares in Skyway 127.369 As such, in the Claimant's view, there could be no possible issue raised concerning its investment.370\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 20.\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 20.\n\n**C. T****he** **S****econd** **O****bjection**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nEven if the Tribunal finds that the Claimant qualifies as an \"investor of a Party\", the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* because the Claimant failed to submit its claim within the three-year limitation period established by Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA. Article 1116(2) provides:\n\n\"An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.\"\n\n272.\n\nIt is undisputed that the present dispute was submitted to arbitration on 1 June 2017, making 1 June 2014 the critical date for purposes of determining the Claimant's compliance with Article 1116(2) (the \"**Critical Date**\").\n\n273.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant knew, or should have known, about the alleged breaches and that it had incurred loss or damage prior to the Critical Date of 1 June 2014 because \"ample information regarding the alleged breach was publicly available prior to the [Critical Date]\" and \"[a]ny reasonably prudent investor in the Ontario renewable energy market \u2013 as the Claimant holds itself out to be\" would or should have been aware of that information.371 As a result, the Respondent argues, the Tribunal has no *ratione temporis* jurisdiction because Claimant's claims are time-barred.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\n274.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimant submits that it did not and could not have known either of the alleged breaches or of the derived loss or damage before 15 August 2015, the date on which the *Mesa Power* post-hearing submissions became publicly available. Therefore, the Claimant submits that its claims were submitted to this Tribunal in a timely manner.\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) Interpretation of Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe Respondent advances four interpretative considerations in respect of Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA, which it claims are \"well-settled\".372\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 98-114; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 57.\n\n276.\n\nFirst, the Respondent maintains that the three-year period in Article 1116(2) is a strict limitation period that forms one of the fundamental bases of its consent to arbitration, and therefore must be complied with in order to establish this Tribunal's jurisdiction.373 According to the Respondent, it has been recognized that provisions setting time limits for commencing disputes, such as Article 1116(2), have the purpose of providing legal predictability and certainty, and preventing States from being forced to present a defence against claims \"for which evidence may no longer be readily available or which require witnesses to recollect events long past\".374 As such, the Respondent points out, failure to comply with the three-year limitation period has resulted in the dismissal of several claims submitted under the NAFTA, Chapter Eleven375 as well as claims brought on the basis of treaties that contain equivalent provisions.376\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 98-101.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 99; *Spence International Investments, LLC, Berkowitz, et al. v.

Measures Concerning the GEIA*\n---------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, all the relevant aspects of the GEIA for the purposes of the Claimant's claim were publicly known, and available in the documents filed in the *Mesa Power* arbitration, press reports and government publications, prior to the Critical Date.408\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 126-135.\n\n287.\n\nFirst, the Respondent posits that the negotiation and signature of the GEIA were \"widely reported in the press in 2009 and 2010\".409 Such reports, the Respondent asserts, demonstrate that \"[f]rom the outset, industry observers were concerned about the impact of the GEIA on the renewables sector in Ontario.\"410\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 126-127; The Star, \"Ontario eyes green job bonanza\", 26 September 2009 (**C-171**); The Globe and Mail, \"Samsung looking to build Lake Erie wind farm\", 27 September 2009 (**R-84**); Renewable Energy World, \"Samsung Invests $7B in Ontario Wind & Solar\", 22 January 2010 (**R-85**); The Globe and Mail, \"'Unfair' advantage cited in Samsung deal\", 25 January 2010 (**R-86**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 126-127; The Globe and Mail, \"'Unfair' advantage cited in Samsung deal\", 25 January 2010, pp. 2-3 (**R-86**).\n\n288.\n\nSecond, the Respondent refers to a number of publicly available documents issued by public bodies that provided information on the GEIA, as well as its terms and/or effects on the FIT Program.411 The Respondent underscores that \"[i]t was public knowledge that the Korean Consortium's projects faced 'challenges' and that the FIT Program was delayed because of the Korean Consortium's need to finalize connection points.\"412 The Respondent specifically refers to the:\n\n(a) Direction from the Ontario Minister of Energy to the OPA of 1 April 2010, which described the GEIA and instructed the OPA to negotiate power purchase agreements with the Korean Consortium in accordance with the terms of the GEIA.413\n\n(b) 2011 Annual Report of the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario, published on 5 December 2011, which discussed *inter alia* details of the renegotiation of the GEIA in 2011 that arose in view of the Korean Consortium's request for an extension to finalize the first phases of its project.

Measures Concerning the Administration of the FIT Program*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant should have first acquired knowledge of the measures it complains of in respect of the administration on the FIT Program, namely that \"Ontario unfairly manipulated the award of access to the electricity grid\", prior to the Critical Date.435\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 137-140.\n\n295.\n\nFirst, the Respondent points out that \"[a]ll of the changes mandated by the June 3, 2011 Direction were public.\"436 Thus, the Claimant cannot now complain of these changes, including the ability to change connection points between regions within the five-day window, the consideration of projects that required paid upgrades to connection points, the award of FIT contracts in the Bruce transmission area for up to only 750 MW, and the West of London transmission area for up to only 300 MW, and the method of determining priority for those FIT contract awards.437\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 138.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 138, *referring to* Directive from Minister of Energy, the Honourable Brad Duguid to Colin Andersen, CEO, Ontario Power Authority, 3 June 2011 (**C-176**); IESO Public News Release, \"Allocating Capacity and Offering FIT Contracts for Bruce to Milton Enabled Projects,\" 3 June 2011 (**C-143**).\n\n296.\n\nSecond, as to \"allegations of unfairness and improper political considerations in the administration of the FIT Program from 2011 to 2013\", the Respondent similarly maintains that the Claimant should have known about these measures prior to the Critical Date because Mesa Power made the same allegations in its Notice of Arbitration filed in 2011.438 Comparing the *Mesa Power* pleadings and the Claimant's submissions, the Respondent contends that the overlap of the allegations \"is incontestable\":439\n\n(a) On 3 June 2011, the OPA issued \"without any prior notice\" \"a new set of rules for awarding FIT Program contracts\" based on the 3 June 2011 Direction. As a result of such new rules, several wind projects in the FIT Program lost available transmission capacity in their designated locations. The June 2011 rules also allowed projects in the West of London region which \"had a higher provincial-wide priority ranking\" to \"build long transmission lines to interconnect in the Bruce Region and thereby jump ahead in the priority ranking\".440\n\n(b) It was \"not offered a FIT Program Contract, because of the 750 MW limit on awards in the Bruce Region, even though there was still available transmission capacity\".441\n\n(c) The Respondent used its authority to implement arbitrary and non-transparent regulatory changes that \"resulted in a direct and immediate benefit to the better-treated companies, and were taken in the context of an Ontario provincial general election\".442\n\n(d) The Respondent gave NextEra preferential access to meetings with high-level government officials and advance access to information concerning regulatory changes.443\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 139.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 142.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 141, *referring to* *Mesa Power Group, LLC v.

John and Derek Tennant allege they learned of only after the *Mesa Power* hearing.447 With respect to the last three additional facts, namely (a) special meetings between senior Ontario government officials and senior wind power corporate officials; (b) the Ontario Ministry of Energy's decisions not to follow the FIT Program's terms; and (c) to not allocate all the available power transmission to successful FIT Program applications, the Respondent maintains that these were all publicly known prior to the Critical Date, through media reports, government publications, and the submissions in the *Mesa Power* and *Windstream Energy* arbitrations.448\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 91.\n\n299.\n\nWith respect to the first two facts, namely the so-called \"Breakfast Club\" conspiracy of government officials and the alleged preferential treatment that IPC received under the FIT Program, the Respondent maintains that even if they only became known to the Claimant after the Critical Date, the Claimant's claims are still time-barred under Article 1116(2).449 This is because, the Respondent contends, the \"essence of the Claimant's complaint is that Ontario favoured certain FIT Program applicants over others for improper political reasons\".450 Thus, the Respondent argues that identifying further alleged \"political favourites\" and other \"secret meetings\" simply provides additional information relating to the same underlying breach, and is insufficient constitute an entirely new self-standing cause of action that would restart the limitation period under Article 1116(2).451\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 85.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 145.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 98; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 1, 86:3-89:20, 90:11-14.\n\n300.\n\nThis position, the Respondent contends, is proven by the fact that although Mesa Power did not have these additional facts when it filed its claim in 2011, it relied heavily on them in its post-hearing submissions, after they were revealed through witness cross-examination and document production, to buttress its Article 1105 claim \u2013 the same claim on which the Claimant alleges these facts are based.452 In this respect, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot use \"unfounded allegations by Mesa Power\" dismissed by the *Mesa Power* tribunal as matters of objective fact to form the basis to start the limitation period afresh.453\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 90.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 69-71.\n\n301.\n\nFurther, the Respondent points out that the Claimant has failed to articulate \"anything distinct about its allegations with respect to [IPC] that distinguish them from its allegations with respect to NextEra\" despite its argument that the situation with respect to IPC was \"different\" and \"significantly worse\" from the events relating to NextEra.454 In the Respondent's view, the Claimant's argument with respect to IPC is the \"exact same claim\" on which the Claimant's alleged breach of Article 1105 rests, the \"exact claim\" that the Claimant's damages experts quantify, and the \"exact one\" Mesa Power filed in 2011.455 As such, the Respondent underlines that the Claimant could have filed the same claim in 2011 that it filed in 2017 regarding the alleged undue political interference that prevented the Claimant from receiving a FIT program on 4 July 2011.456\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66, *quoting* Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 5, 891:16-19.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 67. *See also* Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 5, 746:10-14.\n\n302.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent reiterates that the information with respect to alleged favouritism was publicly available prior to the Critical Date in the context of the *Mesa Power* written submissions.457 Thus, the time in which further alleged \"political favourites\" or details regarding specific meetings became known is irrelevant for triggering the time-limit established in Article 1116(2).458\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 144; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6 64; Meet Mike, mikecrawley.ca, 2012, (**C-166**); Bruce Transmission Project Rankings, 21 December 2010 (**C-104**); Letter from George Smitherman (Minister of Energy) to Colin Anderson (OPA), Direction to OPA, 30 September 2009 (**C-186**); Directive from Minister of Energy, the Honourable Brad Duguid to Colin Anderson, CEO, Ontario Power Authority, 3 June 2011 (**C-176**); Bruce-Milton Contract List, 4 July 2011 (**C-25**). *See also* Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 2, 278:7-280:1; Skyway 127 Project History \u2013 Attachments Only, 1 September 2011 (**C-27**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 144; Rejoinder, \u00b6 98.\n\n*iii.

The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) Interpretation of Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the three-year period established in Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA is initiated when there is actual or constructive knowledge of both (a) a breach; and (b) of loss or damage that has been incurred as a result.483 The Claimant underscores that these are cumulative conditions.484\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 683; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 194.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 683; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 194.\n\n315.\n\nWith respect of the first condition, the Claimant asserts that \"[a] breach under the NAFTA does not occur until there is breach and knowledge of that breach\".485 The Claimant alleges that the determination of the date on which a claimant acquired knowledge of a breach needs to consider the operation of continuing acts.486 According to the Claimant, a breach by a continuing action entails that the host State \"commits a separate breach of international law every day\" of which the investor becomes aware every day.487 Therefore, the Claimant argues that this type of breaches \"cannot be time-barred while the state continues to breach its obligation.\"488 This approach, in the Claimant's view, is consistent with the fact that \"within the NAFTA context, and outside it, international tribunals broadly have approached time limits in a manner to ensure the effectiveness of international tribunals to address internationally wrongful behavior.\"489\n\nReply, \u00b6 271.\n\nReply, \u00b6 217.\n\nReply, \u00b6 218.\n\nReply, \u00b6 218.\n\nReply, \u00b6 237.\n\n316.\n\nThe Claimant refers to the *Feldman v. Mexico* and *UPS v. Canada* arbitrations as instances in which NAFTA tribunals have \"refused to apply Article 1116(2) to bar claims challenging acts that were continuing.\"490 In this regard, the Claimant recalls the *UPS v. Canada* tribunal's determination that \"continuing courses of conduct constitute continuing breaches of legal obligations and renew the limitation period accordingly.\"491 The Claimant also relies on scholarly writing, commentaries prepared by the International Law Commission, and decisions of the European Court of Human Rights recognising that continuous acts could constitute a breach of international obligations.492\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 218-222; *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v.

Canada* tribunal which held that \"[t]he critical requirement is that the loss has occurred and was known or should have been known by the Investor, not that it was or should have been known that loss could or would occur\".494\n\nReply, \u00b6 195.\n\nReply, \u00b6 196; *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

To the contrary, based on the evidence the Claimant has proffered, it knew and could only have known of facts that give rise to each of its four claims as identified in paragraph 13 of its Memorial after 15 August 2015,497 when the *Mesa Power* post-hearing written submissions and the videos of the hearing in that arbitration became available to the public.498 Accordingly, for the Claimant, the only relevant date for the purpose of the limitation period under Article 1116(2) is the date when it gained actual knowledge of the breach.499\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 339, 348-410.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 288-293; Claimant's PHB, \u00b6 15.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\n320.\n\nIn support of its position, the Claimant first makes several overarching arguments. First, the Claimant submits that the date of the alleged breach for purposes of Article 1116(2) is either 30 April 2015 or 15 August 2015.500 This is because the date of breach \"must consider when an investor actually knew, or reasonably ought to have known, of the specific breach at issue\", and it was on these two dates that key documents from the *Mesa Power* arbitration were made available to the public.501 For the same reasons, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's position that the date of the alleged breach for purposes of Article 1116(2) is either 4 July 2011, when Skyway 127 was not awarded a FIT Contract and instead placed on a FIT priority waiting list, or 12 June 2013, when the FIT Program was terminated.502 According to the Claimant, neither date is relevant because even after 4 July 2011, Skyway 127 remained in the running for a contract, and 12 June 2013 \"occurs well before the time when [the Claimant] had actual or constructive knowledge of the internationally wrongful actions taken by Ontario.\"503 In the Claimant's view, the Respondent's \"temporal allegations completely ignore the August 15, 2015 date [the Claimant] pled and the facts upon which [the Claimant] relies\", and has instead \"artificially substitute[d] a series of earlier dates in place\" thereof.504\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 268, 276.\n\nReply, \u00b6 44; Claimant's PHB, \u00b6 18.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 266-267.\n\nReply, \u00b6 267.\n\nReply, \u00b6 286.\n\n321.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, absent evidence of bad faith or unreasonableness, the Tribunal \"should defer to the [Claimant's] judgment about when its claim arose when assessing whether it complied with\" Article 1116(2).505 Citing the award in *Glamis Gold v. United States*, the Claimant asserts that since \"the basis of the claim is to be determined with reference to the submissions of [the] [c]laimant\",506 it \"is entitled to argue its claim based on those measures that it finds material and relevant\".507 In the present case, the Claimant submits that it has in good faith \"articulated specific claims that largely rest on information arising from the public revelation of the October 2014 *Mesa Power* NAFTA Hearing\",508 and \"has been reasonable in arriving at the conclusion that it filed its claim within three years of learning of the facts and acts of Canada's wrongful conduct before bringing its Notice of Arbitration.\"509 Conversely, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has improperly recast the Claimant's claim as one that mirrors that brought by the claimant in the *Mesa Power* arbitration, and in doing so, completely ignored the facts and the claim as pleaded by the Claimant.510\n\nReply, \u00b6 55.\n\nReply, \u00b6 315; *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v.

John Tennant, Derek Tennant and John Pennie, the Claimant did not have actual knowledge of the alleged breaches prior to August 2015, *i.e.*, until after the release of information arising from the *Mesa Power* hearing, resulting to a tolling of the limitation period.541\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 412-420; ; Claimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 35, 48-49; Witness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6\u00b6 37-40 (**CWS-2**); Witness Statement of Derek Tennant, \u00b6\u00b6 47-51 (**CWS-3**); Pennie Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 70, 94, 96-97, 99-101 (**CWS-1**).\n\n335.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Claimant argues that its claims are not time-barred because the evidence demonstrates that the Respondent's continuous act of \"delaying, denying and distracting\" occurred in a three-year zone.542 Such non-instantaneous systematic acts of concealing information and abuse of process, according to the Claimant, constitute continuous and composite breaches of the Respondent's international obligations.543 Consequently, the Claimant contends that a self-standing cause of action crystallized when it first acquired knowledge of the Respondent's unfair conduct in 2015.544\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 5, 879:5-7.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 1, 146:25-147:2, 148:10-20.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 1, 180:7-13; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 5, 880:6-8, 883:16-18.\n\n**3. The Non-Disputing Parties' Submissions**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Submissions of the United States and Mexico**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe non-disputing Parties agree that Article 1116(2) imposes a *ratione temporis* jurisdictional limitation on the authority of a tribunal to act on the merits of a dispute.545 The non-disputing Parties further highlight that NAFTA tribunals have recognized the three-year limitation period to be a \"clear and rigid\" requirement that is not subject to any \"suspension, prolongation or other qualification\".546\n\nUnited States' Second Submission, \u00b6 3; Mexico's Second Submission, \u00b6 8.\n\nMexico's Second Submission, \u00b6 9; *Grand River Enterprise Six Nations, Ltd., Jerry Montour, Kenneth Hill and Arthur Montour v.

United States*.562\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 20, *referring to* *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., Jerry Montour, Kenneth Hill and Arthur Montour v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 20 July 2006, \u00b6 59 (**RLA-70**).\n\n344.\n\nFinally, the NAFTA Parties agree with the finding in *Mondev v. United States* that a claimant need not have full knowledge of the allegedly \"incurred loss or damage\" in order to start the limitation period under Article 1116(2).563\n\nRespondent's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6 21, *referring to* *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, \u00b6 87 (**RLA-83**).\n\n**(c) The Claimant's Reply to the Submissions of the Non-Disputing Parties**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nFor the Claimant, the test for constructive knowledge formulated in *Grand River v. United States* is too narrow and is not consistent with the objectives and context of the NAFTA.564 Noting that its claims first arose in 2015 with the release of information from the *Mesa Power* hearing in October 2014, the Claimant considers that \"it would be inequitable to allow Canada to wrongful[ly] hide the knowledge of its wrongfulness and at the same time suggest that the time clock was running\".565\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, fn. 1.\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 13. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 180-181.\n\n346.\n\nRelying on *Resolute Forest Products v. Canada*, the Claimant submits that Tennant Energy could not have known of the wrongful actions of the Respondent due to the Respondent's \"subterfuge in hiding this information from the public\" and that the Respondent's practices to ensure that no information was available to the public could not allow the time clock to run.566 Given that the Respondent has not challenged the jurisdiction for actions that arose after Tennant Energy had its shares formally registered in 2015, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear to its claims.567\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 21, *referring to* *Resolute Forest Products v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 January 2018, \u00b6 154 (**RLA-79**).\n\nClaimant's Second Article 1128 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nAs set out above, the Respondent's two Preliminary Objections are:\n\n(a) **First Objection**: the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* under Article 1116(1) because the Claimant was not an \"investor of a Party\" when the alleged breach occurred.\n\n(b) **Second Objection**: the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* because the Claimant failed to submit its claim within the three-year limitation period established by Article 1116(2) of the NAFTA.\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal turns first, below, to the objection that the Claimant was not an \"investor of a Party\" when the breach occurred. In setting out its analysis on both objections, the Tribunal has considered all relevant factual and legal arguments presented in the disputing Parties' written submissions and oral presentations. The fact that any argument, allegation or any specific evidence is not mentioned does not mean that the Tribunal has not considered it.\n\n**A. T****he** **F****irst** **O****bjection**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Preliminary Considerations**\n---------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent, and with the United States and Mexico in their Article 1128 submissions, that compliance with Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA constitutes a jurisdictional requirement in respect of which the Claimant bears the burden of proof.\n\n350.\n\nArticle 1122(1) of the NAFTA states that \"[e]ach Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement\". Unless a claim is submitted in accordance with the procedures under NAFTA, there is no consent. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that consent is a question of jurisdiction.568\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 55; *William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2009-04, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 17 March 2015, \u00b6 229 (**RLA-3**); *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, \u00b6 120 (**RLA-2**).\n\n351.\n\nArticle 1116(1) states that an investor of a Party \"may submit to arbitration\" a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under Section A, Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach. In the Tribunal's view, the clear inference of Article 1122(1) read with Article 1116(1) is that NAFTA Parties do not consent to arbitrate a claim which does not satisfy the conditions under Article 1116(1).\n\n352.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that NAFTA tribunals have consistently held that compliance with Article 1116(1) is required to establish a NAFTA Party's consent to arbitration and in turn a tribunal's jurisdiction, and that it is for the claimant to establish that it satisfies the requirements under Article 1116(1).569 The Tribunal sees no good reason to depart from such jurisprudence. The cases cited by the Claimant, including *Pope & Talbot v. Canada*, do not state that an objection under Article 1116(1) constitutes an \"affirmative defence\", nor that the respondent bears the burden of proving that the claim does *not* satisfy the conditions under Article 1116(1).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 56; Rejoinder, \u00b6 18; *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 7 August 2002, \u00b6 120 (**RLA-2**); *Vito G. Gallo v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 55798, Award, 15 September 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 277, 325-326 (**RLA-4**); *Resolute Forest Products Inc. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 January 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 82-83 (**RLA-79**); *B-Mex, LLC and others v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/3, Partial Award, 19 July 2019, \u00b6 145 (**RLA-121**)*.*\n\n353.\n\nThe Claimant relies on Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which states that \"[e]ach party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defence\". In the Tribunal's view, this is simply a restatement of the general principle that a party who relies on a fact to support his claim bears the *evidentiary* burden of proving it. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that this principle does not override the Claimant's *legal* burden of establishing the Tribunal's jurisdiction.570 In *Resolute Forest Products v. Canada*, the tribunal found that Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules imposes on the claimant the burden of proving the facts necessary to establish that a claim has been brought in accordance with Section B of the NAFTA Chapter Eleven.571 The Tribunal agrees.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 19.\n\n*Resolute Forest Products Inc. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 January 2018, \u00b6 84 (**RLA-79**).\n\n354.\n\nHaving found that it is the Claimant's legal burden to establish that it satisfies the requirements under Article 1116(1), the Tribunal considers it necessary to clarify the standard of proof that the Claimant must satisfy at the jurisdictional phase. In the Tribunal's view, the standard of proof is twofold: (a) where an alleged fact is relevant to the merits, the Claimant needs only to establish that fact on a *prima facie* basis; and (b) where an alleged fact is necessary to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Claimant must prove it. This distinction was explained by the tribunal in *Phoenix Action, Ltd v. Czech Republic*:572\n\n\"60. In the Tribunal's view, it cannot take all the facts as alleged by the Claimant as granted facts, as it should do according to the Claimant, but must look into the role these facts play either at the jurisdictional level or at the merits level, as asserted by the Respondent.\n\n61. If the alleged facts are facts that, if proven, would constitute a violation of the relevant BIT, they have indeed to be accepted as such at the jurisdictional stage, until their existence is ascertained or not at the merits level. On the contrary, if jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage. For example, in the present case, all findings of the Tribunal to the effect that there exists a protected investment must be proven, unless the question could not be ascertained at that stage, in which case it should be joined to the merits.\n\n62. This double approach is routinely followed by arbitral tribunals. The alleged facts complained of have to be accepted *pro tem* at the jurisdictional phase. Recently, the tribunal in *Saipem v. Bangladesh*:\n\n\"The Tribunal's task is to determine the meaning and scope of the provisions upon which [the claimant] relies to assert jurisdiction and to assess whether the facts alleged by [the claimant] fall within those provisions or would be capable, if proven, of constituting breaches of the treaty obligations involved. In performing this task, the Tribunal will apply a *prima facie* standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope of the relevant BIT provisions and to the assessment whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions. In doing so, the Tribunal will assess whether [the claimant's] case is reasonably arguable on its face. If the result is affirmative, jurisdiction will be established but the existence of breaches will remain to be litigated on the merits.\"\n\nIt is quite clear that the tribunal refers here to facts capable of being analyzed as a breach of the BIT, and not to facts whose existence is necessary to support jurisdiction.\n\n63. If, on the contrary, the alleged facts are facts on which the jurisdiction of the tribunal rests, it seems evident that the tribunal has to decide on those facts, if contested between the parties, and cannot accept the facts as alleged by the claimant. The tribunal must take into account the facts and their interpretation as alleged by the claimant, as well as the facts and their interpretation as alleged by the respondent, and take a decision on their existence and proper interpretation. To take a simple example, if under a BIT entered into by Italy, a tribunal only has jurisdiction if the claimant is an Italian investor and if, at the jurisdictional level, a claimant asserts that he is Italian, and the respondent alleges that he is not, the tribunal cannot simply accept the facts as asserted by the claimant and confirm its jurisdiction, but it has to make a decision in order to verify whether or not it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the investor, based on his Italian nationality.\"\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 60-63 (**RLA-5**).\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with this analysis. For the purposes of the First Objection, the Tribunal must therefore be satisfied that the Claimant has established, on a *prima facie* basis, that its claim on the merits falls within the scope of Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA. In addition, where the Claimant asserts facts which are necessary to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction, including that there exists a protected investment and that the Claimant is a protected investor, the Tribunal must make a finding on whether these facts have been proven by the Claimant.\n\n**2. The Pre-conditions for Jurisdiction under Article 1116(1)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nThe corollary of the Tribunal's finding that Article 1116(1) constitutes a jurisdictional requirement is that, unless all conditions under Article 1116(1) are satisfied to the requisite standard of proof, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear the present claim. Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA states:\n\n\"**Article 1116: Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf**\n\n1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:\n\n(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or\n\n(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Section A,\n\nand that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\"\n\n357.\n\nOn a plain reading of Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA, the following requirements must be satisfied to the requisite standard of proof for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction:\n\n(a) First, the claimant must be \"[a]n investor of a Party\". For the reasons explained above, the facts which establish the Claimant's status as an \"investor of a Party\" within the meaning of the NAFTA must be proven by the Claimant.\n\n(b) Second, the claimant must allege a breach of a NAFTA obligation. Where the claimant alleges a breach of an obligation under Section A, Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA, Article 1101 (\"Scope and Coverage\") must be satisfied. Article 1101(1) establishes both the scope and coverage of the substantive protections accorded to investors and investments as well as the scope of the rights to submit disputes to arbitration. Pursuant to Article 1101, the claim must target measures adopted or maintained by a Party \"relating to\" investors of another Party and investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party. In this regard, the Tribunal's role is to assess whether the claim, as stated by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration and Memorial, *prima facie* satisfies the requirements of Article 1101 and therefore falls within the scope and coverage of the NAFTA. The Tribunal must not attempt at this stage to determine the merits of the claim.573\n\n(c) Third, the claimant must have incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, the alleged breach. Since Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA refers to \"the\" investor having incurred loss or damage, the same \"investor of a Party\" who brings the claim must itself have suffered loss or damage arising from the breach.574 The Claimant must establish, on a *prima facie* basis, that it had itself suffered loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, the alleged breach. The Claimant need not prove the extent of such loss or damage suffered, given that these facts necessarily relate to the Claimant's case on the merits.575\n\n(d) Fourth, the claimant must be bringing the claim on its own behalf, and not on behalf of another party. Article 1116 of the NAFTA is entitled \"Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf\", which is contrasted with Article 1117, entitled \"Claim by an Investor of a Party on Behalf of an Enterprise\".\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and Others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983, \u00b6 38 (**CLA-283**).\n\n*Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/20/3, Final Award, 31 January 2022, \u00b6 200 (**RLA-207**).\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Award on Preliminary Motion to Dismiss the Claim Because it Falls Outside the Scope and Coverage of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, 26 January 2000, \u00b6 25 (**CLA-284**): \"In its Statement of Claim the Investor claims that the breaches described above relate to the Investor or the Investment, and that in each case it or the Investment has sustained loss or damage by reason of those breaches. For the purposes of the present Motion, the Tribunal must take those assertions of fact as true*.*\"\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 1116 of the NAFTA does not expressly state that the claimant-investor must be the same investor who owned or controlled the investment at the time of the alleged breach, or that the allegedly wrongful measures must have directly affected the claimant-investor.\n\n**3. Whether the Claimant is an \"investor of a Party\"**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nArticle 1139 of the NAFTA defines an \"investor of a Party\" as follows:\n\n\"**investor of a Party** means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of such Party, that seeks to make, is making or has made an investment;\"\n\n360.\n\nArticle 1139 further defines an \"investment of an investor of a Party\" as follows:\n\n\"**investment of an investor of a Party** means an investment owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of such Party;\"\n\n361.\n\n\"Investment\" is defined broadly under Article 1139 to include many different types of investments, including an enterprise and shares in an enterprise.\n\n362.\n\nTennant Energy is a United States' corporation. Presently, Tennant Energy owns shares in Skyway 127,576 an Ontario corporation. This makes Tennant Energy an investor as defined by paragraph (b) of the definition of \"investment\" under Article 1139 of the NAFTA.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 773(d); Pennie Statement, \u00b6 66(d) (**CWS-1**).\n\n363.\n\nThe Respondent does not challenge the Claimant's current status as an investor. Instead, the Respondent objects to jurisdiction on the basis that the Claimant was not an investor *when the alleged NAFTA breach occurred*. The Respondent submits that all of the measures alleged by the Claimant to breach Article 1105 occurred *before* the Claimant became an \"investor of a Party\" on 15 January 2015.577 This objection requires an analysis of when the Claimant first became an \"investor of a Party\" and when the alleged breaches occurred, which the Tribunal considers in turn below.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63.\n\n**4. When the Claimant Became an \"investor of a Party\"**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nIt is evident from the definition of \"investment of an investor of a Party\" under Article 1139 that the Claimant does not need to both own *and* control an investment in order to qualify as an \"investor of a Party\". The Claimant needs only to show that it either owned *or* controlled the investment.\n\n365.\n\nThere is no dispute that the Claimant obtained legal ownership of 45.2% of the shares of Skyway 127 on 15 January 2015. The Claimant alleges that it was an investor of a Party even prior to 15 January 2015 because:\n\n(a) the Claimant owned Skyway 127 shares beneficially under an oral trust created in April 2011;578 and/or\n\n(b) the Claimant controlled Skyway 127 since 31 December 2011.579\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)-(b), 119.\n\nReply, \u00b6 154.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal considers each allegation below.\n\n**5. Ownership**\n----------------\n\n**(a) The Alleged Existence of an Oral Trust**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Claimant asserts that Mr. John Tennant acquired 11.3% of Skyway 127 shares on 19 April 2011 to be held in trust, and designated Tennant Travel as the beneficiary owner of the shares on 26 April 2011.580 On 31 December 2011, Mr. John Tennant acquired a further 11.3% of Skyway 127 shares (bringing his total shareholding to 22.6%), which he likewise designated Tennant Travel as the beneficial owner of.581 Accordingly, the Claimant submits that it was an American investor with an investment in Skyway 127 from 26 April 2011.582\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 69, 84.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 153-154.\n\nReply, \u00b6 88.\n\n368.\n\nThere is no dispute that Californian law is the applicable law for determining the existence of an alleged trust created by Mr. John Tennant over the Skyway 127 shares in favour of the Claimant. The Parties also do not dispute that a trust can be created orally, and that the legal requirements for creating a trust are the existence of trust property, a purpose that is not illegal or against public policy, a beneficiary that is ascertainable with reasonable certainty or that is sufficiently described, and an intention to create a trust.583 The Respondent's main contention with the Claimant's case on oral trust is the lack of evidence.584\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 30.\n\n*See* \u00b6 205 above; Lodise Report, \u00b6 46 (**RER-1**).\n\n369.\n\nThe standard for determining whether or not an oral trust exists under California law is clear and convincing evidence.585 The Parties' respective experts agree that this standard requires a high probability on the evidence, and that it lies between the standard of a preponderance of evidence and the standard of beyond all reasonable doubt.586 In addition, the Tribunal considers that the cases of *Butte Fire Cases*, *Higgins v Higgins*, and *Nevarrez v. San Marino Skilled Nursing & Wellness Ctr., LLC* interpret the same standard of a high probability on the evidence, notwithstanding that they describe the standard in different terms. The Tribunal's view is fortified by the fact that the Judicial Council of California's Civil Jury Instructions, which cites *Butte Fire Cases* as authority, states that the requirement of clear and convincing evidence \"means the party must persuade you that it is highly probable that the fact is true\".587\n\nCalifornia Probate Code, \u00a7 15207(a) (**R-90**); Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 4, 645:22-646:23, 659:10-116.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 4, 658:16-2, 660:11-14; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 4, 669:20-670:24.\n\nJudicial Council of California, Civil Jury Instructions, Series 100-2500 (**C-270**).\n\n370.\n\nHaving reviewed the evidence and considered the submissions made by the disputing Parties, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Mr. John Tennant created an oral trust and held the Skyway 127 shares in trust for Tennant Travel.\n\n371.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal considers it significant that there is no contemporaneous documentary evidence to corroborate the existence or terms of the alleged oral trust. The Tribunal notes that the 437,500 Skyway 127 shares (*i.e.*, the alleged trust property) were pledged as security for a loan by Mr. John Tennant of $200,000 to his brother's company. According to Mr. Tennant, this was a fairly significant personal loan.588 The loan was documented by: (a) a written promissory note between Mr. John Tennant as lender, IQ Properties as borrower and Mr. Derek Tennant guarantor;589 and (b) Skyway 127's written acknowledgment of the promissory note issued to Mr. John Tennant and IQ Properties, and signed by Mr. John Pennie.590 When IQ Properties defaulted on the loan, Mr. John Tennant issued a written notice to demand that the Skyway 127 shares be transferred to him in the event of a failure to pay by 19 April 2011.591 As at 19 April 2011, when IQ Properties still did not pay, the total debt owed to Mr. John Tennant including interest would have been around $270,000.592 Therefore, the 437,500 Skyway 127 shares represented the value of approximately $270,000.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 347:4-6.\n\nPromissory Note to Mr. John H. Tennant, 19 October 2007 (**C-265**).\n\nLetter of Acknowledgement between Mr. John H. Tennant and I Q Properties Inc., 20 October 2007 (**C-266**).\n\nDemand Notice to T Q Properties Inc. & Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc., 19 October 2010 (**C-267**).\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 351:14-18.\n\n372.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, given Messrs. John Tennant, Derek Tennant and John Pennie's careful documentation of the loan and its default, it is incongruous that the same individuals would not take any steps to document the alleged trust, or register Tennant Travel's alleged beneficial ownership of the shares in Skyway 127's records. The first time that Skyway 127's ledger makes reference to Tennant Travel's interest in the shares is on 15 January 2015593 (*i.e.*, nearly four years after the trust was allegedly created). The Tribunal considers that Messrs. John Tennant, Derek Tennant, and John Pennie are reasonably sophisticated businessmen who would have appreciated that it would be prudent to record the alleged trust in writing if they had intended to create such a trust. The Tribunal is not persuaded that Mr. John Tennant would have simply *assumed* that the Skyway 127 ledgers reflected Tennant Travel's beneficial ownership,594 without taking steps to verify the same with Mr. Pennie.595\n\nShareholders & Transfers Register: Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc., 15 January 2015 (**C-115**).\n\nWitness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6 28 (**CWS-2**); Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 358:21-24.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 359:1-4.\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal is additionally troubled by the fact that, despite the alleged creation of the trust on 19 April 2011, the Shareholders & Transfers Register for Skyway 127 on 9 June 2011, 20 June 2011 and 30 December 2011 make no reference to Tennant Travel's beneficial ownership in Skyway 127's shares.596 When the Register was updated on 20 June 2011 and 30 December 211, it was updated to reflect *Mr. John Tennant's* 11.3% and 22.6% shareholding respectively, but made no mention of a trust.\n\nShareholders & Transfers Register: Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc., 9 June 2011 (**C-116**); Shareholders & Transfers Register: Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc., 20 June 2011 (**C-117**); Shareholders & Transfers Register: Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc., 30 December 2011 (**C-114**).\n\n374.\n\nIf, as the Claimant asserts, the purpose of the alleged trust was to prevent the dilution of voting control in Skyway 127,597 it is reasonable to expect that steps would be taken to ensure that the trust was reflected in Skyway 127's records. No documentation of the trust exists, and the Claimant has not been able to provide any satisfactory explanation for the absence of documentation.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 5, 795:3-22, 796:6-24, 797:12-23.\n\n375.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that a contemporaneous writing is not necessary to prove an oral trust under California law.598 However, in the Tribunal's view, the absence of *any* contemporaneous writing by reasonably sophisticated businessmen, who have on other occasions documented their dealings in writing, weighs considerably in favour of a finding that no oral trust in fact existed.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 4, 641:1-21.\n\n376.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal finds that Mr. John Tennant's memorandum of 18 February 2016 to Tennant Energy, which is the only documentary evidence adduced by the Claimant in support of the alleged trust, does not constitute contemporaneous or reliable evidence of the alleged trust.599 Mr. Tennant issued this memorandum nearly 5 years after the alleged trust was created, and after he had discussed the Respondent's alleged breach of NAFTA with the Claimant's counsel in mid-June 2015.600 Whilst Mr. Tennant had stated in the memorandum that he at all times held the Skyway 127 shares as \"bare trustee\", Mr. Tennant testified during the Hearing on Jurisdiction that the term \"bare trustee\" was \"someone else's term\", and that he did not know what it meant.601\n\nMemorandum to the Management Board, Tennant Energy, LLC, 8 February 2016 (**C-268**).\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 386:18-24.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 408:2-13.\n\n377.\n\nThird, the Tribunal also finds that the evidence of Mr. John Tennant, Mr. Derek Tennant, and Mr. Pennie does not constitute clear, convincing, or reliable evidence of the alleged oral trust.\n\n378.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there are critical inconsistencies in the witness testimonies as to when Tennant Travel was designated as the alleged beneficiary of the Skyway 127 shares. Mr. John Tennant's evidence that he had designated Tennant Travel as beneficiary on 26 April 2011602 contradicts Mr. John Pennie and Mr. Derek Tennant's testimony at the Hearing that Mr. Tennant still had not designated a company to hold his Skyway 127 shares by 30 December 2011.603 Mr. Derek Tennant's testimony at the Hearing on Jurisdiction also contradicted his statement that Mr. John Tennant informed him by telephone on 26 April 2011 that he was holding the shares in trust for Tennant Travel.604\n\nWitness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6 19 (**CWS-2**); Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 372:12-15, 373:17-25.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 2, 247:16-24; Pennie Statement, \u00b6 48 (**CWS-1**); Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 454:11-15.\n\nWitness Statement of Derek Tennant, \u00b6 24 (**CWS-3**).\n\n379.\n\nMore fundamentally, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Mr. John Tennant had an intention to create a trust at the material time. In the Tribunal's view, at its best, the evidence shows that Mr. John Tennant intended for his Skyway 127 shares to be ultimately transferred to a holding company.605 It is not clear to the Tribunal that until legal title to the shares were transferred, Mr. Tennant also intended to hold the shares as trustee for the holding company. The purpose of creating this alleged trust was not clearly and consistently articulated by the witnesses. As the Respondent pointed out,606 four different potential purposes were advanced by the Claimant during the Hearing: (a) avoiding a community property dispute;607 (b) preventing the dilution of voting control;608 (c) avoiding taxes;609 and (d) continuity of control over shares.610 Additionally, the Tribunal finds it difficult to see how Mr. Tennant's purported creation of a trust over his Skyway 127 shares in favour of a holding company which he allegedly owned 90% of the shares in611 serves the alleged purpose of preventing the dilution of voting control.\n\nWitness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6 20 (**CWS-2**); Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 380:4-5, 406:3-7.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 37.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 382:18-383:18.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 384:3-6.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 2, 249:21-250:6.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 468:25-469:5.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 365:5-10.\n\n380.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Mr. John Tennant held his shares in Skyway 127 in trust for Tennant Travel prior to 15 January 2015. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant did not own any part of the investment prior to 15 January 2015.\n\n**(b) Control**\n---------------\n\n381.\n\nThe issue of ownership aside, the Claimant argues that it in any event qualifies as an investor because it also exercised control over its investment.612\n\nReply, \u00b6 143.\n\n382.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it had effective voting control of Skyway 127 since 31 December 2011613 because: (a) Mr. John Tennant held his 22.6% shareholding in Skyway 127 in trust for Tennant Travel; (b) Mr. John Tennant, Mr. John Pennie, and Ms. Marilyn Field agreed to follow Mr. Tennant in voting; and (c) GE Energy, which at the time held 50% of the shares in Skyway 127, was a silent investor.614 According to the Claimant, this allowed Mr. John Tennant to make decisions for Skyway 127 on behalf of Tennant Travel.615\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 152-154, 167.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 152-154, 167.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 154, 167-168.\n\n383.\n\nThe Tribunal is not satisfied that the Claimant controlled the investment within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139 from 31 December 2011.\n\n384.\n\nCrucially, in the Tribunal's view, the Claimant's case of control is inseparable from and contingent on its case of an oral trust. Mr. John Tennant would not have been able to make decisions for Skyway 127 \"on behalf of Tennant Travel\" if his Skyway 127 shares were not held in trust for Tennant Travel. Mr. John Tennant would have been making those decisions on his own behalf. Given the Tribunal's finding that Mr. John Tennant did not hold his shares in trust for Tennant Travel, it follows that Tennant Travel could not have had control over Skyway 127 prior to owning shares on 15 January 2015. This alone is sufficient to dispose of the Claimant's argument on control.\n\n385.\n\nIn any case, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Mr. John Tennant exercised control over Skyway 127, whether on his own behalf or on behalf of Tennant Travel.\n\n386.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that \"control\" under NAFTA can mean either legal control or *de facto* control.616 Legal control may exist by reason of the percentage of shares held, voting rights, or other legal rights conveyed in instruments such as the company's articles or shareholders' agreements.617 Legal control may also exist by reason of multiple shareholders' collective shareholding and voting rights.618 The Tribunal is not persuaded that Mr. John Tennant had the legal capacity to control Skyway 127, whether independently or collectively with Mr. John Pennie and Ms. Marilyn Field.\n\n*B-Mex, LLC and others v.

The alleged voting bloc between Mr. Tennant, Mr. Pennie and Ms. Field comprised 45.2% of Skyway 127's shares at December 2011, which is a minority interest. In the first place, the Tribunal notes that there is no documentary evidence of the alleged agreement between Mr. Tennant, Mr. Pennie and Ms. Field to vote their shares together, nor any documentary evidence of the three individuals actually voting in common.619 There is also no documentary evidence to show that GE Energy, a separate entity holding 50% of Skyway 127's shares in December 2011, was a passive investor that did not vote its shares.620\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 2, 273:22-274:4; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 399:9-13, 466:21-467:5.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 2, 236:11-21, 274:5-11; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 400:3-6; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 467:6-11.\n\n388.\n\nThe evidence on record does not present a clear picture of how shareholder decisions were made in Skyway 127, given the absence of any meeting minutes, shareholder vote records, or other legal instruments which may govern shareholders' voting rights. For example, in *B-Mex v. Mexico*, legal control was assessed by reference to the companies' bylaws.621 In *Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia*, the tribunal considered the entities' constitution and articles of association to determine legal control.622 No similar points of reference can be found in the present case.\n\n*B-Mex, LLC and others v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/3, Partial Award, 19 July 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 228-230 (**RLA-121**).\n\n*Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v Republic of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 317-323 (**RLA-183**).\n\n389.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considers it relevant that under the Ontario Business Corporations Act, a corporation shall be deemed to be controlled only if one holds more than 50% of the votes that may be cast to elect directors of the corporation, and the votes are sufficient, if exercised, to elect a majority of the directors of the corporation.623 The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant's submission that the Tribunal should have no regard to Ontario corporate law in determining whether control was in fact exercised over Skyway 127.624 In *Perenco v. Ecuador*, the tribunal had regard to Bahamian law in determining whether control was exercised over the claimant, a Bahamian entity. The tribunal's observations in *Perenco* are instructive:625\n\n\"518. It can be fairly asked why an international tribunal which derives its jurisdiction from an international treaty specifically concerned with the reciprocal promotion and protection of investment ought not to be concerned with the formalities of the law of the particular State pursuant to which a company has been incorporated when considering the ownership and governance of that company. [\u2026]\n\n519. Thus, since the Claimant is a creature of Bahamian law, the Tribunal must look to the operation of that law. [\u2026]\n\n520. Both general international law and the applicable bilateral Treaty lack the specificity and particularity of municipal law (e.g. French law, Ecuadorian law, or Bahamian law) in terms of the ordering of corporate relations and neither purports to regulate such spheres of corporate activity in detail.\"\n\nOntario Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. B. 16, s. 1(5) (**R-97**).\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 126-130.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Limited and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador) v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability, 12 September 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 518-520 (**RLA-182**).\n\n390.\n\nTo be clear, the Tribunal is not purporting to be constrained by the definition of control under Ontario law in determining the meaning of \"control\" under NAFTA Article 1139, which as the Tribunal highlights above, is wider than the concept of \"legal control\". Nevertheless, as far as \"legal control\" is concerned, the fact that the alleged 45.2% voting bloc, even if proved, does not amount to control of an Ontario corporation under Ontario law is a relevant consideration and leads the Tribunal to the conclusion that Mr. John Tennant did not in fact have legal control over Skyway 127.\n\n391.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal is troubled by the fact that two of the three members in the voting bloc, Mr. Pennie and Ms. Field, are Canadian citizens. Of the 45.2% alleged voting bloc, 22.6% would comprise Canadian ownership. Therefore, even if 45.2% was sufficient to confer legal control over Skyway 127, such legal control would not be held by a U.S. investor and would not, as a consequence, satisfy the nationality requirement under NAFTA Chapter Eleven.\n\n392.\n\nThe Tribunal is similarly not convinced that Mr. John Tennant had *de facto* control of Skyway 127. The Tribunal accepts that *de facto* control will, in the words of the *B-Mex* tribunal, \"typically, and logically, present a greater evidentiary challenge.\"626 The Tribunal is unable to conclude that the Claimant has met the evidentiary challenge when the Claimant has adduced *no* documents to show any indicia of *de facto* control \u2013 for example, that Mr. John Tennant exercised significant influence over Skyway 127, had the power to effectively decide and implement key decisions of Skyway 127, or had any power to direct the actions of Skyway 127.\n\n*B-Mex, LLC and others v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/3, Partial Award, 19 July 2019, \u00b6 220 (**RLA-121**).\n\n393.\n\nIn any case, the Tribunal emphasises that the critical point remains that any control exercised by Mr. Tennant, even if found, cannot be attributed to the Claimant without a finding of an oral trust. Mr. John Tennant and Mr. Derek Tennant confirmed at the Hearing on Jurisdiction that there are no documents to show that Tennant Travel otherwise held any rights to direct the actions of Skyway 127.627\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 400:10-21; Hearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 465:13-466:1.\n\n394.\n\nInsofar as the Claimant seeks to attribute any control exercised by Mr. John Tennant to Tennant Travel through the concept of \"indirect control\", as found in the *S.D. Myers* case, the Tribunal is of the view that the *S.D. Myers* case does not assist the Claimant in establishing control.\n\n395.\n\nIn *S.D. Myers*,628 the tribunal found that the claimant (SDMI) indirectly controlled the investment (Myers Canada) notwithstanding that it did not own shares in the investment at the time of the alleged breach. Instead, the shares of Myers Canada were owned equally by four members of the Myers family, who also owned shares in different proportions in SDMI.629 The tribunal found that Mr. Dana Myers, a member of the Myers family, was the authoritative voice of both SDMI and Myers Canada,630 and that there was \"uncontradicted evidence\" that he was the controlling person in respect of the entirety of the Myers family's business interests, including SDMI and Myers Canada.631 Mr. Dana Myers was also the chief executive officer of SDMI, and held 51% of the shares in SDMI.632 The tribunal's analysis on indirect control is set out below:\n\n\"229. Taking into account the objectives of the NAFTA, and the obligation of the Parties to interpret and apply its provisions in light of those objectives, the Tribunal does not accept that an otherwise meritorious claim should fail solely by reason of the corporate structure adopted by a claimant in order to organise the way in which it conducts its business affairs. The Tribunal's view is reinforced by the use of the word \"indirectly\" in the second of the definitions quoted above.\"\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 12 November 2000 (**CLA-111**).\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 12 November 2000, \u00b6\u00b6 226-227 (**CLA-111**).\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v.

Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 12 November 2000, \u00b6\u00b6 89, 227 (**CLA-111**).\n\n396.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the *S.D. Myers* case is factually distinguishable. It appears that the tribunal in *S.D. Myers* placed significant weight on the fact that the claimant and the investment shared the same controlling mind at the relevant time, Mr. Dana Myers. Here, the Tribunal has found that Mr. John Tennant did not exercise legal or *de facto* control over Skyway 127. For the same reasons, Mr. Tennant cannot be said to be the \"authoritative voice\" or \"controlling person\" of Skyway 127. Further, the Tribunal notes the lack of any documentation to support Mr. John Tennant's claim that Mr. Derek Tennant \"let [him] have\" 90% of the shares in Tennant Travel.633 Mr. John Tennant was also unable to state with precision when such share transfer allegedly took place,634 thus leaving the Tribunal with no clear reference point in time by which to assess whether Mr. John Tennant was in fact the controlling person of both Tennant Travel and Skyway 127 at the same time. Unlike *S.D. Myers*, in which the investment was wholly owned by the Myers family, the Tennant family did not wholly or majority-own Skyway 127 in December 2011.\n\nWitness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6 18 (**CWS-2**).\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 365:2-366:10.\n\n397.\n\nThe relationship between SDMI and Myers Canada was also unique. The tribunal found that Myers Canada was \"established to be the Canadian face of SDMI\", was \"provided with capital, know-how and managerial directions by SDMI\", and \"carried on business as if it were a branch of SDMI\".635 In essence, there was evidence that SDMI and Myers Canada acted in concert. There is no evidence of any such relationship between the Claimant and Skyway 127 prior to the Claimant owning shares in Skyway 127 in January 2015.\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Second Partial Award, 21 October 2002, \u00b6 109 (**CLA-193**).\n\n398.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent's submission that the NAFTA does not disclose any basis to pierce the Claimant's corporate veil and to find jurisdiction solely based on the fact that the Claimant and Skyway 127 shared the same minority shareholder (Mr. John Tennant).636 By virtue of the definition of \"investment of an investor of a Party\" under NAFTA Article 1139, it is the *claimant* that must directly or indirectly control the investment in order to found jurisdiction. The language of the Treaty does not permit the *claimant's owners* to be the one directly or indirectly controlling the investment. In the Tribunal's view, if the NAFTA Parties had intended to disregard the international and domestic law principle of a corporation's separate legal personality, clear words would have been used to do so. The Tribunal is not aware of any other decision in which a claimant's separate legal personality was disregarded to establish jurisdiction, save for *S.D. Myers.*\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 13.\n\n399.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant did not directly or indirectly control Skyway 127 within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139 until 30 June 2016, the point at which it acquired GE Energy's 50% shareholding in Skyway 127, taking its ownership above the 50% mark.\n\n**(c) Conclusions on When the Claimant Became an \"investor of a Party\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nAs noted above, the burden is on the Claimant, Tennant Energy, to establish that it owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, Skyway 127, the investment of the investor of a Party, and the point in time at which such ownership or control crystallized. The scope and coverage of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, addressed in Article 1101(1), imposes this requirement, as do (in the circumstances of this case) the terms of Article 1105, on which the Claimant relies.\n\n401.\n\nHaving rejected the Claimant's case on oral trust and on ownership and control of Skyway 127, it necessarily follows from the Tribunal's decision that the Claimant only became an \"investor of a Party\" on 15 January 2015, when it obtained legal ownership of 45.2% of the shares of Skyway 127, or on 30 June 2016, at which point it acquired GE Energy's 50% shareholding in Skyway 127, taking its shareholding above the 50% mark.\n\n402.\n\nPrior to 15 January 2015, therefore, on any analysis, the Claimant did not hold an \"investment\" in Skyway 127 that was capable of constituting an \"investment of an investor of a Party\".\n\n**6. When the Alleged Breaches Occurred**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nBased on the manner in which the Claimant has pleaded its case, it is not clear to the Tribunal when the Respondent's alleged wrongful measures are said to have taken place. In particular, the Claimant does not clearly and fully set out the specific government measures and actions that allegedly breached Article 1105 of the NAFTA, or the dates on which they occurred. Instead, the Claimant's submissions on Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA focused on two main arguments: (a) it qualified as an \"investor of a Party\" on 26 April 2011 when it acquired beneficial ownership of Skyway 127 shares under an oral trust, which is before the Claimant was placed on a FIT priority waiting list on 4 July 2011 and before the FIT Program was terminated on 12 June 2013; and (b) in any event, the alleged breaches did not occur until August 2015, when the Claimant first became aware or could have been aware of the Respondent's internationally wrongful acts.637\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 236-261 above.\n\n404.\n\nAs set out above, the Tribunal has dismissed the Claimant's argument of an oral trust.\n\n405.\n\nThe Tribunal likewise finds no merit in the Claimant's argument that \"[a] breach under the NAFTA does not occur until there is breach and knowledge of that breach.\"638 As the Tribunal had stated in its Procedural Order No. 8, the question of *when the alleged breach occurred* is separate from the question of *when the Claimant knew or should have known of the alleged breach*.639 The Tribunal's conclusion is fortified by the language of Article 1116(1) and Article 1116(2), which draws a clear distinction between *a breach* and *knowledge of a breach*. Specifically, Article 1116(1) provides that an investor of a Party may submit to arbitration a claim \"*that another Party has breached an obligation* [\u2026] and that the investor *has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach*\" (emphasis added). Article 1116(2) in turn provides that \"[a]n investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, *knowledge of the alleged breach* and *knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage*\" (emphasis added). In other words, a breach does not necessarily occur at the time when an investor first acquired knowledge of the wrongful measure. A breach occurs at the time the wrongful measure took place. The limitation period however starts running only after *knowledge* of the *alleged breach* and *loss* is first acquired. To this end, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent's submission that the date of the alleged breach is an objective event, and cannot be changed by the subjective knowledge of a claimant.640 In the Tribunal's view, the Claimant's submission confuses the requirements under Article 1116(1) with the temporal restrictions for bringing a claim under Article 1116(2).\n\nReply, \u00b6 271.\n\nProcedural Order No. 8, \u00b6 42.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 30.\n\n406.\n\nTo ascertain when the alleged breaches occurred, the Tribunal considers it helpful to reproduce below the table set out at page 37 of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial, which purports to summarize the measures alleged by the Claimant to be wrongful, and the dates on which they occurred.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Challenged Measures Alleged by the Claimant** | **Date(s)** |\n| **Challenged Measures Related to the GEIA** |\n| Ontario negotiated the GEIA in \"secret\". | December 12, 2008 to January 21, 2010 |\n| Ontario did not make the terms of the GEIA public upon conclusion. | January 21, 2010 |\n| Ontario reserved transmission capacity for the Korean Consortium, and provided its projects priority access to transmission capacity. | September 30, 2009 to April 1, 2010 |\n| Ontario reserved 500 MW of transmission capacity in the Bruce region for the Korean Consortium. | September 17, 2010 |\n| Ontario granted the Korean Consortium an extension to select connection points in the Bruce region, instead of cancelling the GEIA. | August 3, 2011 |\n| Ontario allowed the Korean Consortium and its partner Pattern Energy to acquire lower-ranked FIT application projects. | 2010 to September 13, 2011 |\n| **Challenged Measures Related to the FIT Program** |\n| Ontario revised the rules of the FIT Program (including the allocation of transmission capacity in the Bruce and West of London regions, and the Connection Point Amendment Window). | June 3, 2011 |\n| Ontario provided NextEra preferential access to government officials and advanced information on FIT Rule changes. | 2011 |\n| Ontario favoured NextEra and IPC in awarding FIT Contracts. | July 4, 2011 |\n| The Minister issued a Direction to the OPA to no longer procure any additional MW under the FIT Program for large FIT projects. | June 12, 2013 |\n| **Challenged Measure Related to the Management of Information** |\n| Staff of the former Minister of Energy and Premier of Ontario allegedly destroyed documents relating to the two cancelled gas plants and to Ontario's deferral on the development of off-shore wind projects. | August 2011 to February 2013 |\n\n407.\n\nAs set out in the table, the challenged measures occurred between 2008 and 2013. The Tribunal notes that this has not been disputed by the Claimant. In fact, the Claimant states expressly that \"[t]here is no dispute that [Ontario's wrongful measures] took place before June 1, 2014.\"641 Given that the Tribunal has held above that the Claimant became an \"investor of a Party\" only on 15 January 2015 at the earliest, then at the time the allegedly wrongful measures took place between 2008 and 2013 (or 2014), the Tribunal finds that the Claimant was not an investor of a Party within the meaning of Article 1116(1).\n\nReply, \u00b6 42.\n\n408.\n\nFor completeness, the Tribunal does not accept the Claimant's submission that the Respondent's allegedly wrongful acts were continuous, composite, and/or complex acts.642 The characterization of a wrongful act as continuing or composite affects the date on which a breach of an international obligation occurs and how long the breach extends. As set out in the International Law Commission's 2001 Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"**ILC Articles**\"):\n\n(a) The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State not having a continuing character (an \"instantaneous act\") occurs at the moment when the act is performed.643\n\n(b) The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State having a continuing character (a \"continuing act\") extends over the entire period during which the act continues and remains not in conformity with the international obligation.644\n\n(c) Where an international obligation is breached through a series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful (a \"composite act\"), the breach extends over the entire period starting with the first of the actions or omissions of the series and lasts for as long as these actions or omissions are repeated and remain not in conformity with the international obligation.645\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6 41.\n\nILC Articles, Article 14(1) (**CLA-185**).\n\nILC Articles, Article 14(2) (**CLA-185**).\n\nILC Articles, Article 15 (**CLA-185**).\n\n409.\n\nPut simply, continuing and composite wrongful acts give rise to continuing breaches. The ILC Articles do not address \"complex acts\", and the Claimant does not explain what is meant by a \"complex act\", or whether it is an accepted classification under international law.646 In fact, the characterization of the Respondent's conduct as \"complex\" appears to have arisen for the first time in the Claimant's closing submissions at the Hearing on Jurisdiction.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 5, 873:19-876:8.\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant's case on the nature of the Respondent's allegedly wrongful acts is wholly unclear. Whilst the Claimant asserts that the Respondent's conduct is simultaneously continuous, composite and complex, the Claimant fails to particularize which of the challenged measures constitutes a continuing wrongful act, and which of the challenged measures taken together are cumulatively wrongful.\n\n411.\n\nInstead, the Claimant places significant emphasis on the Respondent's alleged acts of deception to conceal its internationally wrongful acts. According to the Claimant, \"the concealment by the government forms an essential part of the composite breach.\"647 However, as highlighted at paragraphs 406 and 407, even the alleged destruction of documents took place before 1 June 2014.\n\nReply, \u00b6 271.\n\n412.\n\nIndeed, the Claimant's case on the date of breach hinges entirely on the date of the Claimant's claimed *discovery* of the breach.648 This is evident from the Claimant's submission that \"[t]he August 15, 2015 date of a breach under NAFTA Article 1116 ***remains the same whether the breach was to be considered as a single act, a continuous act or as part of a composite act*** involving systemic state practice ***as the disclosure of the systemic practice also first occurred on August 15, 20[15]***\" (emphasis added).649\n\n*See* Claimant's PHB, \u00b6 40, where the Claimant alleges that \"the time of the breach occurs upon discovery of the truth\".\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 716.\n\n413.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to accept this submission. A later discovery of an earlier wrongful act does not make that wrongful act \"continuing\" or \"composite\". As the Tribunal has explained at paragraph 405 above, the conflation of the date of an alleged breach (an objective event) and the date of disclosure and therefore knowledge of the alleged breach (a subjective event) is misguided.\n\n414.\n\nThe conclusion of the Tribunal's analysis is that the Claimant was not an \"investor of a Party\" within the meaning of Article 1116(1) at the time the alleged breaches took place. The Claimant only became an investor of a Party on 15 January 2015 at the earliest, after all of the Respondent's alleged breaches had taken place.\n\n**7. The Claimant as a \"Successor in Interest\"**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to consider the Claimant's further argument that, even if it did not own Skyway 127 shares or control Skyway 127 prior to 15 January 2015, it would still be a protected investor because it is a \"successor in interest\" to any claims that Mr. John Tennant may have had under the NAFTA prior to 15 January 2015. It is not disputed that Mr. John Tennant, being a U.S. citizen, was an \"investor of a Party\" when he owned Skyway 127 shares between 20 June 2011 and 15 January 2015. According to the Claimant, when Mr. John Tennant transferred his Skyway 127 shares to Tennant Travel on 15 January 2015, all his rights to a claim under NAFTA were also transferred to Tennant Travel. Pursuant to the Claimant's expert testimony, choses in action such as NAFTA rights are automatically conveyed with the shares under California law.650\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 76-85.\n\n416.\n\nThe Respondent avers that the applicable law to determine whether NAFTA claims may be assigned is NAFTA and international law, not California law. According to the Respondent, and the Article 1128 submissions from the United States and Mexico, NAFTA offers no mechanism to assign investment claims because Article 1116(1) requires a claimant to be an \"investor of a Party\" when the alleged breach occurred.651 The Respondent thus submits that \"NAFTA claims, and potential causes of action under NAFTA, cannot be assigned to other investors freely on the open market\".652\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 64-74; Respondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 17-27.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 19.\n\n417.\n\nThe Respondent also relies upon the Final Award in *Westmoreland* for the propositions that a claimant must be a protected investor at the time of the alleged breach, and the challenged measures must have a \"direct and immediate effect on the claimant\". The Respondent argues that this is \"impossible where a claimant did not own or control its investment when the challenged measures were adopted or maintained\".653 In turn, the Claimant submits that the *Westmoreland* Award is \"not a complete and reliable treatment of this issue\" as the tribunal failed to consider Article 1109 of the NAFTA which expressly permits transfers of investments, which was noted by the *Loewen* NAFTA tribunal.654\n\nRespondent's *Westmoreland* Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimant's *Westmoreland* Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 94-103.\n\n418.\n\nThe Tribunal makes the following observations.\n\n419.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not cited any cases in which a tribunal found that it had jurisdiction to hear a claim brought by the claimant as an assignee of a NAFTA claim who did not own or control the investment at the time of the alleged breach. The cases of *Daimler v. Argentina*, *Loewen v. United States*, and *Enron v. Argentina* cited by the Claimant do not concern a similar factual matrix and do not, in the Tribunal's view, stand for the proposition that an assignee or subsequent owner of an investment can bring a NAFTA claim in respect of breaches that occurred prior to the assignment or ownership. *Daimler* was considered by the *Westmoreland* tribunal, and was distinguished on the basis that the claimant had owned or controlled the investment at the time of the alleged treaty breach, but no longer owned or controlled the investment at the time the arbitration was commenced.655 *Enron* did not involve the issue of an assigned claim, but whether a shareholder making an investment in a company that makes an investment in another company, and so on, could invoke a direct right of action for measures affecting a corporation at the end of the chain.656 The tribunal in *Enron* concluded that a \"*cut-off point*\" had to be established, and the answer lay in establishing whether the host State's consent to arbitration had been extended to the investor in question.657 *Daimler* and *Enron* were also not NAFTA cases.\n\n*Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/20/3, Final Award, 31 January 2022, \u00b6 210 (**RLA-207**).\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v.

The tribunal made no ruling on whether, had Nafcanco qualified as a continuing national, the tribunal would have jurisdiction to hear the claim.\n\n*The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award, 26 June 2003, \u00b6 220 (**CLA-138**).\n\n421.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the Claimant's submission that the *Loewen* tribunal \"noted that NAFTA Article 1109 permissively recognized transfers of property which would include the NAFTA [c]laim.\"659 The assignment from TLGI to Nafcanco was not challenged in *Loewen*.660 More importantly, the Tribunal struggles to see the relevance of Article 1109 to the issue of whether a claimant qualifies as a protected investor under the NAFTA Article 1109(1) states that each Party shall permit all transfers relating to an investment of an investor of another Party in the territory of the Party to be made freely and without delay. Article 1109(1) does not state that the *transferee* becomes a protected investor under the NAFTA by virtue of the permitted transfer. Nor does Article 1109(1) state that NAFTA Parties consent to arbitrate claims brought by such transferee.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6 94; Claimant's *Westmoreland* Submission, \u00b6 99.\n\n*The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.

The tribunal found that only the party which owned the investment at the time of the alleged treaty breach has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to bring a claim.662 The tribunal based its finding on its construction of Articles 1101(1), 1116(1) and 1117(1) of the NAFTA, as follows:\n\n(a) Pursuant to Article 1101(1), the alleged wrongful measures must relate to investors of another Party and investments of investors of another Party in the territory of the Party. Article 1101(1)(a) and Article 1101(1)(b) must refer to the same \"investor[s] of another Party\". According to the tribunal, this means that the claimant (*i.e.*, Westmoreland) must show that the challenged measures related to the claimant itself as well as to its investment.663\n\n(b) Pursuant to the text of Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1), the investor/claimant must be claiming on its own behalf \"such that it held the investment at the time of the alleged breach\" and must itself have suffered loss or damage arising out of that breach.664\n\n(c) The tribunal's construction of Article 1101(1), 1116(1) and 1117(1) comports with the object and purpose of the NAFTA to increase substantially investment opportunities in the territories of the Parties. According to the tribunal, in order to encourage and support this investment, \"an investor must have taken a risk by making an investment in order to be assured of treaty protection\". A purchaser or assignee of an investment subsequent to any treaty breach does not take a risk that there may be a subsequent treaty breach.665\n\n*Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v.

Further, the tribunal found that \"relate to\" means that the challenged measure must \"directly address, target, implicate, or affect the claimant\" or have a \"direct and immediate effect on the claimant\".666 Accordingly, the tribunal ruled that in order for Westmoreland to be able to bring its claim it must show firstly that the challenged measures applied to it and secondly that it itself suffered loss as a result of those challenged measures.667\n\n*Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v.

Nor do they state that the wrongful measures must have directly affected the claimant. The text of the NAFTA does not make these connections of temporality and directness on its face, although it could have been drafted to do so clearly. The Tribunal is being asked to add to the text of the Treaty in making such a finding.\n\n427.\n\nThe Claimant cites *Loewen* as embodying the proper rule that only a continuity of nationality is required for jurisdiction over a transferred claim.668 In other words, an investor can transfer its interest to another party who brings the claim as long as they are both of the same nationality. However, the problem with this simple rule is that it does not by itself encompass all of the jurisdictional elements of Article 1116, and they were not all placed in issue in the *Loewen* case.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 93, 94, 96; Claimant's *Westmoreland* Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 98, 99, 101.\n\n428.\n\nArticle 1116(1) is clear that the claimant-investor must be claiming on its behalf and must itself have suffered loss or damage arising out of the alleged breach. What is less clear is whether the \"investor of a Party\" under Article 1116(1), who brings the claim and who itself suffers loss or damage arising out of the breach, must be the same \"investor[s] of another Party\" under Article 1101(1)(a) who the wrongful measures related to. It is true that because the claim must be submitted by an investor, and the investor who submits the claim must have suffered a loss or damage by reason of a NAFTA breach, in most cases the claimant *will be* the investor who held the investment at the time of the breach. The question is whether there are any other circumstances in which a claimant who files a NAFTA claim could also be an investor who suffered loss or damage as a result of the alleged breach without having held the investment at the time of the alleged breach.\n\n429.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal cannot exclude the possibility of an investor, whilst not an investor at the time of the breach, assuming an indirect loss or damage by reason of or arising from the breach *after* the breach has occurred. This might take place *ex hypothesi*, for instance, in a situation where the investor undertakes significant liabilities caused by the alleged breach to another investor, and thus itself suffers loss or damage. There may be other unusual situations in which the same appreciation may also arise but the Tribunal need not decide them as they are not before us.\n\n430.\n\nSecond, an investor who suffers a loss from an alleged breach might sell the investment after the alleged breach (either before or after filing a claim) while expressly seeking to retain the NAFTA claim and still qualify for jurisdiction under Article 1116. This would seem to be the situation in the cases of *Daimler* and *EnCana Corp. v. Ecuador*,669 which the *Westmoreland* tribunal distinguished.670 In both cases, the claimants' respective sale of the investment after the breach occurred was not by itself a bar to the tribunals' jurisdiction over the investors' BIT claims.\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award, 22 August 2012 (**CLA-309**); *EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, LCIA Case No. UN3481, Award, 3 February 2006.\n\n*Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/20/3, Final Award, 31 January 2022, \u00b6 210 (**RLA-207**).\n\n431.\n\nThird, *Westmoreland* also noted that corporate restructuring or internal reorganization is not necessarily fatal to jurisdiction.671 For example, according to *Westmoreland*, a legal successor involving a continuity of interest with an investor who owned or controlled the investment at the time of the breach could still qualify for NAFTA jurisdiction.\n\n*Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC v. Government of Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/20/3, Final Award, 31 January 2022, \u00b6 230 (**RLA-207**).\n\n432.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal does not need to decide whether the principles stated in *Westmoreland* would properly apply in all situations. Without prejudice to the reach of the *Westmoreland* principle, and its application in any other circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it provides a sound basis for assessment in the particular circumstances of this case, namely, where the Claimant acquired a minority interest in Skyway 127 on 15 January 2015, and a majority interest only thereafter \u2013 dates which, in the Tribunal's assessment, on any reading, postdate 12 June 2013, when the FIT Program was terminated and it was clear that Skyway 127 would not receive a FIT Contract. In other words, the Claimant would have acquired those shares in Skyway 127 with knowledge that Skyway 127 had failed to receive a FIT Contract. In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal considers that the principle that, to be a qualifying investor under the NAFTA, a putative investor must hold a qualifying interest at the time of breach, applies reasonably and properly. The Claimant cannot now sue for losses arising from Skyway 127's failure to obtain a FIT Contract when it knew that there would be no FIT Contract at the time it became an investor. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that it has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to hear any NAFTA claim which Mr. John Tennant purportedly assigned to the Claimant as a \"successor in interest\".\n\n**8. Whether the Claimant Suffered Loss or Damage by Reason of, or Arising out of, the Alleged Breaches**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n433.\n\nIn any event, even if it were *not* necessary for the purposes of Article 1116(1) for the Claimant to hold a qualifying interest at the time of the breach, the Claimant has not proved, on a *prima facie* basis, that it had itself incurred any incidence of loss or damage by reason of or arising from the Respondent's alleged breach, which occurred prior to the Claimant becoming an investor and acquiring an investment. This means that a condition under Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA is not satisfied, and consequently, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the claim.\n\n434.\n\nThe Claimant does not dispute that it must *itself* have incurred loss or damage arising out of the Respondent's alleged breaches in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA.672 The Claimant submits that it suffered loss or damage to its investment in Skyway 127 as a result of the Respondent's alleged breach.673 The loss and damage claimed by the Claimant comprise:\n\n(a) Economic losses calculated on the basis of the differential between the \"but for\" cash flows and \"actual cash flows\" on the assumption that Tennant Energy obtained a FIT Contract for the project. \"But for\" cash flows are determined as the difference between cash flows that Tennant Energy would have expected to receive, net of any cash outflows that Tennant would have to incur to earn such incoming cash flows.674\n\n(b) Moral damages for the \"reputational, psychological, and emotional harm\" suffered by Tennant Energy and the corporate officials of Tennant Energy.675\n\nReply, \u00b6 195; Claimant's *Westmoreland* Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\nClaimant's *Westmoreland* Submission, \u00b6 25.\n\nDeloitte Report, \u00b6\u00b6 7.2.1-7.2.3 (**CER-1**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 892-899.\n\n435.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that the abovementioned categories of loss and damage were, or could have been, suffered by the Claimant, Tennant Energy.\n\n436.\n\nImportantly, the Claimant's claim for economic losses and moral damages is wholly premised on Skyway 127's failure to obtain a FIT Contract. The Deloitte Report calculated the economic losses suffered by the Claimant on the basis of the net present value of the incremental cash flow the Claimant would have received over the period of a 20-year FIT Contract, assuming that a FIT Contract had been obtained.676 Mr. John Tennant,677 Mr. Derek Tennant678 and Mr. John Pennie679 made claims that Skyway 127 suffered loss of the FIT Contract, and that they each suffered anxiety and/or stress from discovering that Skyway 127 was not awarded a FIT Contract as a result of the Respondent's alleged internationally wrongful measures. The Claimant further asserts that Tennant Energy is entitled to moral damages for the reputational, psychological, and emotional harm suffered by Tennant Energy \"due to the internationally wrongful measures taken by Canada\".680\n\nDeloitte Report, \u00b6\u00b6 2.1.5, 7.2.1 (**CER-1**).\n\nWitness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6\u00b6 43-45 (**CWS-2**).\n\nWitness Statement of Derek Tennant, \u00b6\u00b6 54-56 (**CWS-3**).\n\nPennie Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 114-118 (**CWS-1**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 894.\n\n437.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it critical that the Respondent's alleged wrongful measures occurred between 2008 to 2013 (or 2014), and any loss arising from Skyway 127's failure to obtain a FIT Contract crystallized at the latest by 12 June 2013, when the FIT Program was terminated and it was clear that Skyway 127 would not receive a FIT Contract.681 This is well before the Claimant owned shares in Skyway 127 on 15 January 2015. To be clear, the date on which the loss occurred is relevant, in the Tribunal's view, for determining whether the *Claimant* as the party bringing the NAFTA claim incurred any loss or damage within the meaning of Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA. However, that is not to be conflated with the date on which the Claimant first acquired knowledge of the loss, which is relevant for determining when the 3-year limitation period starts to run under Article 1116(2).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 235, 258.\n\n438.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Tribunal does not foreclose the possibility of an investor who acquires an investment *after* an alleged treaty breach to have assumed the loss caused to the investment by the breach. However, the Tribunal is unable to find that such a case is made out on the present facts.\n\n439.\n\nFirst, on 15 January 2015, the Claimant acquired 45.2% of Skyway 127 shares, of which 22.6% were acquired from Mr. John Tennant, a U.S. citizen, and the remaining 22.6% were acquired from Mr. John Pennie and Ms. Marilyn Field.682\n\nShareholders & Transfers Register: Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc., 15 January 2015 (**C-115**).\n\n440.\n\nGiven that Mr. John Pennie and Ms. Marilyn Field are Canadian citizens, the Claimant cannot be said to have assumed any loss caused to an investment of an investor of a Party within the meaning of Article 1139 of the NAFTA by acquiring their shares.\n\n441.\n\nAs regards the 22.6% shares owned by Mr. John Tennant as a U.S. citizen, there is no evidence, nor does the Claimant allege, that it paid any consideration when it acquired these shares from Mr. John Tennant on 15 January 2015, or that it in any other way assumed whatever loss may have occurred because of any Treaty breaches. The Claimant's witness statements and pleadings are silent on this point. Mr. John Tennant simply states that \"the Skyway 127 shares in the trust were formally transferred over to Tennant Travel Services and registered in January 2015.\"683 In fact, given the Claimant's case that Mr. John Tennant always held the Skyway 127 shares for the benefit of Tennant Travel under an oral trust, it would seem incongruous for the Claimant to have paid consideration for Mr. John Tennant's shares on, or at any time prior to, 15 January 2015. Whilst Mr. John Tennant had acquired his 11.3% shares from I.Q. Properties on 20 June 2011 in exchange for $200,000 (being the sum of his loan to Mr. Derek Tennant), this would amount to consideration from Mr. John Tennant, and not from the Claimant. Similarly, even if Mr. John Tennant had paid consideration for his acquisition of a further 11.3% shares from Premier Renewable Energy Ltd on 30 December 2011 (of which there is no evidence),684 this would not constitute consideration from the Claimant.\n\nWitness Statement of John Tennant, \u00b6 28 (**CWS-2**).\n\nShareholders & Transfers Register: Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc., 30 December 2011 (**C-114**); Memorial \u00b6 128.\n\n442.\n\nSecond, there is insufficient evidence for the Tribunal to conclude that the Claimant paid any consideration for its subsequent acquisition of Skyway 127 shares *after* 15 January 2015. The Tribunal notes that the changes in the Claimant's shareholding in Skyway 127 are unclear after January 2015:\n\n(a) From 15 January 2015 to 30 June 2016, the Claimant held 45.2% of Skyway 127 shares.\n\n(b) On 30 June 2016, GE Energy allegedly transferred its shares in Skyway 127 to the Claimant \"in exchange for consideration, including the irrevocable right to sell wind turbines to it if Skyway 127 is awarded a renewable energy contract by Ontario\" (the \"**GE Energy Shares**\").685 The Claimant does not specify the number of shares transferred by GE Energy to the Claimant, nor the amount of consideration paid by the Claimant for GE Energy's shares. The Claimant has also not adduced any documentary evidence to show that it indeed acquired GE Energy's shares, much less for any consideration.\n\n(c) More importantly, it is not clear to the Tribunal that there was a continuity of U.S. nationality in respect of the GE Energy Shares between the time of the alleged breaches (*i.e.*, 2008 to 2014) and the Claimant's later acquisition of those shares on 30 June 2016. Based on the documentary evidence before the Tribunal, GE Energy had disposed *all* of its Skyway 127 shares between 30 December 2011 and 15 January 2015.686 It is not evident who GE Energy transferred its Skyway 127 shares to during this period. In any case, it is clear that those shares were not transferred to the Claimant since the Claimant first acquired its Skyway 127 shares only on 15 January 2015 from Mr. John Tennant, Mr. John Pennie, and Ms. Marilyn Field.687 Subsequently, GE Energy reacquired shares in Skyway 127 on an unknown date, and then purportedly transferred the GE Energy Shares to the Claimant on 30 June 2016.\n\n(d) After 30 June 2016, it is alleged that Tennant \"owned almost all of the shares in Skyway 127\".688 There is again no evidence of payment from the Claimant for these shares.\n\nPennie Statement, \u00b6 67 (**CWS-1**); Memorial \u00b6 133 (emphasis added).\n\nShareholders & Transfers Register: Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc., 30 December 2011 (**C-114**); Shareholders & Transfers Register: Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc., 15 January 2015 (**C-115**).\n\nShareholders & Transfers Register: Skyway 127 Wind Energy Inc., 15 January 2015 (**C-115**).\n\nPennie Statement, \u00b6 68 (**CWS-1**).\n\n443.\n\nEven if consideration had been paid by the Claimant for its acquisition of Skyway 127 shares *on* or *after* 15 January 2015, the Claimant would have acquired those shares with the knowledge that Skyway 127 failed to receive a FIT contract on 12 June 2013. This necessarily leads the Tribunal to the conclusion that any consideration paid would have taken into account Skyway 127's failure to receive a FIT contract. This is not the case where, for instance, the Claimant acquired Skyway 127 shares at a premium because there was an expectation that Skyway 127 may in the future receive a FIT contract. At the time it acquired Skyway 127 shares, the Claimant was well aware that Skyway 127 had failed to obtain a FIT contract. The Claimant also has not asserted that it suffered any loss in an indirect way, whether by assuming any liabilities suffered by Mr. John Tennant because of the alleged breaches or otherwise. Consequently, it is difficult to see what loss or damage the Claimant could have itself suffered by reason of, or arising out of, the alleged breaches which led to Skyway 127's failure to obtain a FIT contract.\n\n444.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not proved, on a *prima facie* basis, that it incurred any loss or damage by reason of or arising from the Respondent's alleged breach, which occurred prior to the Claimant becoming an investor and acquiring an investment. The Tribunal's decision means that a condition under Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA is not satisfied, and consequently, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the claim.\n\n**9. Conclusions on the First Objection**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n445.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds in favour of the Respondent on the First Objection.\n\n**B. T****he** **S****econd** **O****bjection**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n446.\n\nThe Tribunal having found in the Respondent's favour on the First Objection, and thus disposing of the case in its entirety for the Respondent, considers that it need not address the Second Objection.\n\n**VIII. THE RESPONDENT'S RE-APPLICATION FOR SECURITY FOR COSTS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nIn the Respondent's re-application for security for costs dated 16 February 2022, the Respondent relied on Mr. John Tennant's testimony at the Hearing on Jurisdiction that Tennant Energy is a holding company with no financial resources in a bank account, no assets besides the Skyway 127 shares, and no business operations selling goods or services to consumers.689 According to the Respondent, this is new evidence which provides a reasonable basis to find that the Claimant is impecunious. The Respondent thus requested that the Tribunal order Tennant Energy to issue:\n\n(a) security for costs within 90 days of the order, either by depositing the security into an escrow account arranged by the PCA or by submitting a bank guarantee, in the amount of **CAD 1,477,098.91** for the procedural and jurisdictional phase of the proceeding; and\n\n(b) security for costs in the amount of **CAD 5,456,903.04** for the remaining phases of the arbitration at a later date that the Tribunal deems appropriate, should the arbitration proceed to the merits and damages phases.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction Transcript, Day 3, 395:10-24.\n\n448.\n\nIf Tribunal issues an order for security for costs, and if the Claimant subsequently indicates that it has been unable to obtain the funds or a bank guarantee to satisfy the order, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal: (a) order Tennant Energy to credibly demonstrate that it has taken best efforts to satisfy the order for security for costs; (b) sign an undertaking to confirm that the Claimant will pay any adverse costs orders; and (c) take into account Tennant Energy's non-compliance in the Tribunal's final decision on the allocation of costs.\n\n449.\n\nIn response, the Claimant argued that the Respondent does not demonstrate any \"exceptional circumstances\" or urgency which would justify an interim order for security for costs. According to the Claimant, Mr. Tennant's testimony at the Hearing is not new and does not amount to an admission of impecuniosity.\n\n450.\n\nThe Tribunal hereby dismisses the Respondent's renewed application for security for costs. The Respondent's application is unavoidably contingent on the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction. In the light of the Tribunal's decision that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimant's claim, the issue of security for costs is moot. The Tribunal will decide on the issue of costs below.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. T****he** **P****arties****' A****rguments on** **C****osts**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nWere it to have been successful in its claim, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to bear the costs of the arbitration that have been incurred by the Claimant as defined in Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, in the total amount of USD 5,430,768.03,690 including the following costs:\n\n(a) attorney fees and disbursements at USD 5,097,825.64;\n\n(b) costs of expert witnesses at USD 150,848.46;\n\n(c) other disbursements at USD 31,245.47; and\n\n(d) fees paid for Tribunal and Institutions at USD 335,000.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, \u00b6 40.\n\n452.\n\nAccording to the Claimant,691 Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules sets out two separate tests for awarding costs. Paragraph 1 of Article 40 creates a rebuttable presumption that arbitration costs (which the Claimant defines to mean costs of the arbitration or institutional fees paid to the Tribunal, the secretariat, and the appointing authority) will be paid by the unsuccessful party. Paragraph 2 of Article 40 further provides that representation costs (which the Claimant defines to mean legal costs and associated expert fees, and management costs) are mainly left to the Tribunal's discretion based on the circumstances of the case.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 13-40.\n\n453.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant asserted that the Respondent should bear the arbitration costs of this arbitration, as well as the Claimant's representation costs in full, if the Claimant is successful in any of its claim. In particular, the Claimant relies on *inter alia*: (a) the complexity and novelty of the claim,692 (b) that the Claimant's claim was made in good faith, and was reasonable in light of the circumstances of the Respondent's unfair and non-transparent conduct,693 and (c) the amount of the Claimant's costs are proportional to the amounts in dispute.694\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, \u00b6 25.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, \u00b6 33.\n\n454.\n\nThe Claimant further asserted that were it not to be successful in any of its arbitration claims, it should: (a) still be awarded certain specific and identifiable costs incurred due to the Respondent's vexatious arguments, repetitive and convoluted pleadings, and conduct throughout these proceedings under Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules,695 and (b) not bear the Respondent's arbitration or representation costs.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 34-39.\n\n455.\n\nIn respect of (a) above, the Claimant requested an award of 50% of the costs (USD 2,781,000) based on the Respondent's alleged vexatious argumentation and egregious conduct, which caused the Claimant specific, identifiable and unnecessary costs.\n\n456.\n\nIn respect of (b) above, the Claimant submitted, amongst others, that several aspects of the claim were novel and of the first instance,696 there was no unreasonable or wasteful conduct on the Claimant's behalf,697 and that material misrepresentations were allegedly made by the Respondent denying any maladministration in the FIT Program when the record demonstrates that the Respondent knew at the time that these public statements were false and intended to mislead.698\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 50-55.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 44, 57.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submissions, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 56.\n\n457.\n\nOn the contrary, the Respondent argued that the Claimant should never have brought this claim because the Respondent had not consented to arbitrate it under NAFTA Chapter Eleven. Thus, if the Tribunal determines that it has no jurisdiction over this claim by finding for the Respondent on one or both of its jurisdictional objections, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant to bear all of the costs of this arbitration and the Respondent's legal costs pursuant to NAFTA Article 1135(1) and Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.699 The Respondent submitted that it should be entitled to CAD 3,526,411.02, which comprises of:700\n\n(a) arbitration costs at CAD 932,262.88; and\n\n(b) legal representation and assistance at CAD 2,594,148.14.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 21.\n\n458.\n\nWere payment not to be received by the Respondent within 30 days of the issuance of the Award, the Respondent further requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant to pay post-award compound interest.701\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, \u00b6 21.\n\n459.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that in principle, the unsuccessful party shall bear the arbitration costs, and that Article 40(2) provides that the Tribunal has discretion to apportion the disputing parties' legal representation and assistance costs as it considers reasonable. In apportioning costs under Article 40, the Respondent argued that the Tribunal should have regard both to the outcome of the proceedings and to the relevant factors in order to serve the dual function of reparation and dissuasion.\n\n460.\n\nConsequently, the Respondent claimed that it should be awarded all its arbitration costs and costs of legal representation and assistance because (a) the Claimant's legal arguments were convoluted, incurred and unsupported by jurisprudence,702 (b) the Claimant's factual assertions continuously shifted and lacked evidentiary support,703 (c) the Claimant created procedural difficulties throughout the arbitration by *inter alia* re-litigating decisions already made by the Tribunal and attempted to gain for itself a third round of jurisdictional submissions,704 (d) the Claimant filed needless procedural motions in the arbitration and otherwise failed to follow the procedures set by the Tribunal,705 (e) the Claimant persistently objected to reasonable requests from the Respondent,706 and (f) the Claimant's conduct has undermined the integrity of the arbitration proceedings in general.707\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, \u00b6 8.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, \u00b6 8.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, \u00b6 12\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, \u00b6 15.\n\n461.\n\nIf, however, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the Claimant's claim, the Respondent asserted that the Tribunal should refrain from allocating costs for the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings and instead apportion costs with its final award on merits and damages, as only at that time will the Tribunal have a full appreciation of the relevant cost considerations arising over the course of the entire proceeding.708\n\nRespondent's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 17-18.\n\n**B. T****he** **T****ribunal****'****s** **A****nalysis**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n462.\n\nArticle 1135(1) of NAFTA provides that a \"tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.\"\n\n463.\n\nIn the present case, the relevant provisions are Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\n\"1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\"\n\n464.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules further provides:\n\n\"1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\"\n\n465.\n\nArticle 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the unsuccessful party shall \"in principle\" bear all the costs of the arbitration, save for costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in Article 38, paragraph (e). The Tribunal has decided that it has no jurisdiction over the Claimant's claim. Consequently, the Respondent has prevailed in the present proceedings and the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the general rule set out in Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds it appropriate that the Claimant bear the entire costs of the arbitration, as defined in Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n466.\n\nThe Claimant has made advances towards costs in the amount of USD 425,000 and the Respondent also in the amount of USD 425,000, which gives a total advance of USD 850,000. The PCA will provide the Parties with a statement of account after the issuance of this Final Award and will return the unused balance (USD 81,774.88) to the Parties in equal share (*i.e.,* USD 40,887.44 each side).\n\n467.\n\nThe fees and expenses incurred by the members of the Tribunal, as well as those incurred by the PCA in its capacity as Registry in these proceedings, are as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Fees** | **Expenses** |\n| **Mr. Cavinder Bull, SC** | USD 260,535.39 | USD 21,788.48 |\n| **Mr. R. Doak Bishop** | USD 110,300.00 | USD 3,217.24 |\n| **Sir Daniel Bethlehem KC** | USD 138,794.02 | USD 15,599.89 |\n| **Permanent Court of Arbitration** | USD 127,407.25 | USD 12,038.60 |\n\n468.\n\nOther administrative costs, including the costs of organization of the First Procedural Meeting, the Hearing on Bifurcation and Preliminary Motions, and the Hearing on Jurisdiction amount to USD 78,544.25. Thus, the amounts paid from the deposit established with the PCA total USD 768,225.12.\n\n469.\n\nAccordingly, the total costs of the arbitration under Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules amount to USD 950,319.05709 and CAD 359,710.09.710 This includes the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the costs of expert advice, the travel and other expenses of witnesses, and fees and expenses of the PCA (*i.e.,* the items enumerated at Article 38(a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) of the UNCITRAL Rules).\n\nThis figure represents the amounts paid from the deposit established with the PCA (USD 768,225.12) plus all other disbursements in USD corresponding to the items enumerated at Article 38(a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) of the UNCITRAL Rules \u2013 *i.e.*, the Claimant's costs of expert witnesses (USD 150,848.46) and other disbursements (USD 31,245.47).\n\nThis figure represents the Respondent's total disbursements towards the costs of arbitration other than Tribunal Advancements. *See* Respondent's Costs Submission, Annex II.\n\n470.\n\nThe Tribunal thus fixes the costs of arbitration at USD 950,319.05 and CAD 359,710.09, and orders the Claimant to pay to the Respondent USD 384,112.56 (*i.e.*, the share of the amounts paid from the advances on costs borne by the Respondent) plus CAD 359,710.09 (*i.e.*, the Respondent's total disbursements towards the costs of arbitration other than Tribunal Advancements).\n\n471.\n\nTurning to the costs of legal representation and assistance, the UNCITRAL Rules do not contain a presumption for awarding such costs to the successful party. Instead, Article 40(2) provides that in apportioning these costs, the arbitral tribunal should take into account \"the circumstances of the case\". In doing so, and as submitted by the Parties, NAFTA tribunals have generally taken several factors into account, including the novelty of the case and the parties' conduct in the arbitration proceedings.\n\n472.\n\nHere, both Parties have complained that the other Party's conduct led to an unnecessary increase in costs.\n\n473.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that both Parties brought a large number of procedural requests in the course of this arbitration. Whilst neither Party should be faulted for doing so, many of these requests unnecessarily burdened and prolonged the arbitral process. In particular, the Tribunal notes that some of these procedural requests were initiated by and decided against the Respondent, the successful party in this arbitration. This includes the Respondent's Motion for Security for Costs, the Respondent's Motion for Targeted Document Production, as well as the Respondent's applications to impose confidentiality designations.711\n\n*See*, for example, Procedural Order No. 7 and Procedural Order No. 12.\n\n474.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that some of the issues raised were novel. For instance, whether a NAFTA claim can be assigned to another investor who did *not* hold the investment at the time of the breach is a novel issue which was decided only recently, and for the first time, in *Westmoreland*. In fact, the *Westmoreland* Award was issued several months *after* the Hearing on Jurisdiction had concluded. Furthermore, the principles set out in *Westmoreland* are not without controversy and the Tribunal did not reach a conclusion that these principles should apply in *all* situations.\n\n475.\n\nTaking all the above into account, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant should bear all of its own costs, and 80% of the Respondent's legal representation and assistance costs in the amount of CAD 2,075,318.51.\n\n**X. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(a) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear this claim on the grounds that the requirements under Article 1116(1) of the NAFTA are not satisfied;\n\n(b) The Claimant's claim is accordingly dismissed in its entirety;\n\n(c) The Respondent's re-application for security for costs dated 16 February 2022 is dismissed;\n\n(d) The costs of the arbitration are fixed at USD 950,319.05 and CAD 359,710.09;\n\n(e) The Claimant shall bear 100% of the arbitration costs fixed in the preceding paragraph and the Tribunal thus orders that the Claimant pay the Respondent USD 384,112.56 and CAD 359,710.09 within 30 days of notification of this Final Award; and\n\n(f) The Claimant shall bear 80% of the Respondent's legal representation and assistance costs and the Tribunal thus orders that the Claimant pay the Respondent CAD 2,075,318.51 within 30 days of notification of this Final Award.\n\nSeat of the arbitration: Washington, D.C.\n\nDate: 25 October 2022"}]}
