The call for tender required that a minimum 25% of the sitares in the concession receiver be held, directly or indirectly, by a partner with experience in organizing games of chance in Hungary or abroad. This requirement was fulfilled by the participation of 21st Century Resorts a.s. trading as American Chance Casinos **(\"ACC\").** ACC holds 25% of the sitares in KC Bidding; Claimant holds 75%.

In its Revised Valuation Report - Sukoro, Perfekting also valued two properties, *i.e.,* plots number 032/4 and 032/5, which were ultimately not included in the land swap.

The swap contract provided that 20 properties under the ownership of the State (19 existing and a 20th to be created) would be swapped for three properties under the ownership of Mr. Blum. However, the swap contract did not specify for which of the State properties each of the three properties of Mr. Blum would be swapped.\n\n104.\n\nOn 8 May 2009, Mr. Blum and KC Bidding entered into a lease agreement, granting KC Bidding a 24-year lease over four of the 16 Sukoro properties that were not affected by the tract formation procedure (the **\"Leased Real Properties\"),** with an option to extend the term for an additional 10 years (the **\"Lease Agreement\").53**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 152; **Exhibit C-10;** Joint Chronology, item 111.\n\n105.\n\nOn 13 May 2009, the MNV issued a declaration confirming that Mr. Blum had paid the value difference between the exchanged properties and had fulfilled his other obligations arising out of the Land Swap Agreement, and that the properties not affected by the tract formation procedure had been transferred to the possession of Mr. Blum.54\n\n**Exhibit C-87.**\n\n**4.

He confirmed that this public interest requirement was met in light of the contemplated road development project on the Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land.76\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 166; **Exhibit C-105;** Joint Chronology, item 122.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 154; **Exhibit C-105.**\n\n**b) Internal Investigation of the Ministry of Finance**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nAs it was the NVT that had initially approved the Sukor\u00f3 transaction before the Land Swap Agreement was concluded and might therefore have had a vested interest in the outcome of any investigation regarding the Agreement\u2019s validity, the Asset Management Department within the Ministry of Finance also undertook directly to review the land swap transaction.

The Committee recommended the announcement of KC Bidding as the winner of the Tender but noted that the ownership status of the Sukor\u00f3 Site was *\"still not fully settled\u2019* and that investigations were underway.94\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 154; **Exhibit C-89;** Joint Chronology, item 131.\n\n126.\n\nOn 4 August 2009, Mr. Csaba \u00c1rvai, Head of the Main Department of Sectoral Development and Financing within the Ministry of Finance, sent a memorandum to Dr. Oszk\u00f3 in which he discussed the Application Assessment Committee\u2019s report and the advantages and disadvantages associated with accepting or rejecting KC Bidding\u2019s application.

Parallel Discussions regarding the Land Swap Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nOn 4 September 2009, immediately following the issuance of the State Audit Office report at the end of August 2009,97 Dr. Oszko wrote to Mr. Blum as follows:\n\n*\"As it is known to you, the swap transaction related to the Sukoro properties has given rise to significant negative reactions on behalf of the general public in the recent weeks. Moreover, several specific legal concerns have occurred with regard to the property swap which has also been objected to recently by the Hungarian State Audit Office in the recent past. With regard to the above, I consider a review of the recent events necessary because, it is my well-grounded opinion that an investment project which is granted special treatment from the aspect of national economy can only be implemented if it is done without any objections pertaining to prevailing law and the public opinion.*\n\n*Iam of the opinion that in the present situation, we need to find a solution for the legal concerns and those raised by the general public in relation to the property swap transaction. With regard to the latter and considering the fact that even the State Audit Office considered the property swap transaction to be legally null and void in its report, it is raised as a possibility that clarification of legal doubts and concerns can be ensured by the restoration of the previous ownerships of the properties involved in the swap transaction. Naturally, apart from and beyond these facts, I would still like to know the investor\u2019s position and solution proposals considering the legal and societal concerns occurring in wide circles, as well as the report of the State Audit Office and the prosecutorial procedures in progress before the competent state attorney offices with regard to the investment project.*\n\n*I recommend that the problems be discussed at a personal meeting and for this purpose, I hereby request that you kindly contact my secretariat at the following phone number [... ].\"98*\n\n**Exhibit C-110;** Joint Chronology, item 141.\n\n**Exhibit C-117**\n\n129.\n\nUpon receipt of this letter, Mr. Blum sought legal advice from his lawyer Dr. Varga regarding the Land Swap Agreement. On 8 September 2009, Dr. Varga opined that the valuation made by Perfekting met the requirement that the price of the properties had to be set by an independent expert.99 He stated that, based on the Hungarian Civil Code, value disproportionality was not a basis for annulling a contract; it only rendered a contract avoidable.100 Dr. Varga confirmed that the issue was unsettled as to whether the public interest condition, which is required to avoid a public tender, is met when it only relates to a portion of the swapped territory. Dr. Varga considered that this issue could only be settled by assessing the available data and documents, or bringing it before a court.101\n\n**Exhibit C-277,** article IV.\n\n**Exhibit C-277,** article IV.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent pointed out that this relevant portion of Dr. Varga\u2019s opinion was omitted in the English translation submitted by Claimant as **Exhibit C-277.** Rejoinder, note 146.\n\n130.\n\nThe meeting requested by Dr. Oszk\u00f3 in his letter of 4 September 2009 took place on 10 September 2009 between Mr. Blum, his lawyer Dr. B\u00e1rd and Dr. Oszk\u00f3. The Parties disagree as to what topics were discussed at this meeting. The Tribunal will address this meeting in more detail later.\n\n131.\n\nOn 21 September 2009, Treviso, the valuation company appointed by the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office, issued its opinion stating that Perfekting\u2019s valuation appraisal for the Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land was incorrect.102 The opinion stated that the total market value of both the Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land was HUF 193,876,823, rather than HUF 787,400,000 as determined by Perfekting.103\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 188; **Exhibit R-70;** Joint Chronology, item 162. According to the memorandum prepared by Dr. Egedi on 5 October 2009, Mr. Blum purchased the parcels of real estate in 2008 for a total of HUF 225,453,000; Perfekting set the market value at HUF 787,400,000; the tax and value certifications issued by the local governments in June and July 2009 included a value of HUF 136,918,560; and Treviso determined the value to be HUF 193,876,823. **Exhibit R-73.**\n\n**Exhibit R-70.**\n\n132.\n\nOn 1 October 2009, the Ministry of Finance and the MNV received the Treviso opinion104 and thereby, in the MNV\u2019s view, became aware of *\"a major new circumstance* *that may render the swap null and void\"105* The MNV forwarded this appraisal to Dr. Varga.106\n\n**Exhibit R-71,** Joint Chronology, item 164.\n\n**Exhibit C-131.**\n\n**Exhibit C-131.**\n\n133.\n\nIn preparation for Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s *\"meeting to be held regarding the Sukoro real estate property case,\"* Dr. Egedi of the Ministry of Finance reviewed the State Audit Office report and the Treviso opinion and concluded in her memorandum to Dr. Oszk\u00f3 of 5 October 2009 that there were three options for what could be done: (i) *\"the parties can mutually cancel the agreement [... ] supposing that the conditions of a criminal offence are met\"* or, if such conditions have not been met, then, by raising the issue of the state having lost assets (the land swap agreement not being in line with the actual value of the real estate property); (ii) *\"MNV can cancel the contract\";* or (iii) *\"MNV can contest the validity of the agreement.\"107*\n\n**Exhibit R-73;** Joint Chronology, item 169.\n\n134.\n\nOn 5 October 2009, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 and other MNV officials met with Messrs. Langhammer and Blum and Dr. B\u00e1rd. The Parties also disagree on the content and the outcome of this meeting. A main point of disagreement is whether Dr. Oszk\u00f3 recommended to the Project Sponsors that the Land Swap Agreement be terminated on a consensual basis and whether he said that failing an agreement the question of the validity of the Land Swap Agreement would be referred to the courts.\n\n**8. Preparation and Conclusion of the Concession Contract**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nOn 8 September 2009, Dr. B\u00e1rd attended an initial meeting with Mr. Arvai at the Ministry of Finance to discuss the draft Concession Contract. With respect to the contractual deadline to certify legitimate possession and the right to build on the Sukoro Site, Dr. B\u00e1rd proposed *\"the date of submission of the application for the license of the state tax authority, or 1 January 2014 at the latest,\"* instead of the 1 January 2011 deadline proposed by the Ministry of Finance.108\n\n**Exhibit R-67;** Joint Chronology, item 153.\n\n136.\n\nAfter the meeting, on 11 September 2009, Mr. Arvai sent Dr. Oszk\u00f3 the first draft of the Concession Contract and informed him that:\n\n*\"[t]he stringent regulations, guarantees, that you required due to the unsettled legal status with respect of the properties - which are covered in sections 9.3, 12.5.1, 12.5.4, 14.3, 15.2.1.1, and 1 17.10 - can be summarized as follows:*\n\n*1. The concession company shall be obliged to continuously be in lawful possession of the properties and their appropriate parts suitable for the establishment of the casino and the right to build the necessary superstructures within the town of Sukoro no later than as of 1 January 2011 until the expiry of the concession period.*\n\n*2. The concessionaire shall be obliged to verify no later than by 1 January 2011 that it is in lawful possession of the relevant properties and the right to build the necessary superstructures. In the event of breach of this obligation, the Minister of Finance shall have the right to terminate the contract with immediate effect, and the concessionaire shall be obliged to pay a penalty of HUF 900 million for the failure.*\n\n*3. Following the coming into effect of the concession contract, until the commencement of the concession (the time stated in the license for the casino), the concessionaire shall be obliged to report to the Minister of Finance every half year, by 15 January and 15 July, regarding the status of the implementation of the King\u2019s City project, and the progress made in the previous period. In the event of delay, the concessionaire shall be obliged to pay a penalty of HUF 2.47 million for each day of delay.*\n\n*4. It is to be disclosed that the contract is public.\"109*\n\n**Exhibit R-68.**\n\n137.\n\nMr. Arvai noted that he had requested the Minister\u2019s decision *\"regarding the deadline for verification of lawful possession of the Sukoro properties\"* the previous day.110\n\n**Exhibit R-68;** Joint Chronology, item 157.\n\n138.\n\nOn 5 October 2009, Mr. Arvai sent a memorandum to Dr. Oszko reporting on a second meeting with Dr. Bard regarding the Concession Contract, which had taken place on 1 October 2009. Mr. Arvai noted that Dr. Bard had suggested a six-month extension of the deadline in Clause 9.3, *i.e.,* until 1 July 2011 instead of 1 January 2011, and had also stated that, in his opinion, *\"the attacks against the investment because of Sukoro could be stopped, if the concession contract did not particularize settlements as the location of the casino.\"111*\n\n**Exhibit R-72;** Joint Chronology, item 165.\n\n139.\n\nOn 8 October 2009, Mr. Arvai sent a memorandum to Dr. Oszko, with the Concession Contract attached, referring to the fact that the work pertaining to the Concession Contract had been carried out jointly by his division, the Sector Development and Finance Division, and the Legal and Administrative Division, and requesting that the Minister sign the counterparts, should he concur that *\"there are no legal or statutory obstacles to the execution of the Concession Contract.\"112* Mr. \u00c2rvai summarized the parties\u2019 agreement, *inter alia,* that since the Concession Contract limited the right to exercise the concession activities to the locations set out in the Tender, the list of local municipalities that had given their preliminary consent to the Tender was to be attached to the Concession Contract, and the deadline to certify the legitimate possession and document the right to build on the Project Site was to be set at 1 January 2011.113\n\n**Exhibit R-76;** Joint Chronology, item 172.\n\n**Exhibit R-76;** Joint Chronology, item 172.\n\n140.\n\nOn 8 October 2009, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 directed Dr. Janos Nagy, President of the NVT, to take the relevant measures to restore the original condition existing prior to the land swap transaction, and, in the event that no agreement was concluded with the swap partner, Mr. Blum, by 9 November 2009 at the latest, to take the relevant measures for the MNV to take *\"appropriate legal action for establishing the nullity of the swap transaction.\"*114\n\n**Exhibit C-121.**\n\n141.\n\nOn 9 October 2009, KC Bidding and Dr. Oszk\u00f3, in his capacity as Minister of Finance, acting on behalf of Hungary, signed the Concession Contract.115 The location of the Project was left open among the 133 settlements listed in the Tender and in Annex 1 of the Concession Contract, including the Sukoro Site.\n\n**Exhibit C-l;** Joint Chronology, item 174.\n\n**D.

From the Conclusion of the Concession Contract to its Termination**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Land Swap Litigation**\n---------------------------\n\n154.\n\nOn 9 October 2009, two hours after signing the Concession Contract, the Ministry of Finance issued a press release stating that Dr. Oszk\u00f3 had ordered Dr. J\u00e1nos Nagy, President of the NVT, to ensure that the MNV start discussions with Mr. Blum regarding the Sukor\u00f3 land swap *\"with the aim of restoration of the original - pre-land-swap-condition\"* The press release also stated that \"[f]or *the case that discussion will not come to a conclusion within 30 days,\"* the Minister requested Dr. J\u00e1nos Nagy *\"to give* [an] *order to* [the] *MNV to take the necessary legal steps to invalidate the land-swap contract.\"118* Claimant claims that the Project Sponsors and Claimant were not notified about the Ministry\u2019s instructions or the decision to issue a press release at the signing ceremony and were surprised by its contents;119 the Tribunal notes that the record does not show that there was any reaction from the Project Sponsors, voiced to a representative of Respondent.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 204; **Exhibit C-128;** Joint Chronology, item 175.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 511; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 36. Claimant also submits that the press release *\"took Mr. Blum completely by surprise.\"* Memorial, \u00b6 205, quoting Blum I, \u00b6 68.\n\n155.\n\nOn 20 October 2009, Dr. Varga met, on Mr. Blum\u2019s behalf, with officials from the MNV, including Dr. Attila Morvai, MNV\u2019s Chief Legal Counsel, to discuss the new situation created by the Treviso appraisal regarding the Pilis Land and the Albertirsa Land that the MNV had received on 1 October 2009. Dr. Morvai stated that he was under instructions to attempt by 9 November 2009, through negotiations, to restore the situation existing prior to the signing of the Land Swap Agreement, *i.e.,* to terminate the Land Swap Agreement and refund to Mr. Blum amounts paid to MNV plus interest. The MNV set a final deadline of 29 October 2009, 11:00 a.m., for Mr. Blum to respond. Dr. Morvai stated that if this deadline was not observed, the issue would be referred to the courts in order to restore the original situation prevailing before the conclusion of the land swap transaction.120\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 209; **Exhibit C-131;** Joint Chronology, item 183.\n\n156.\n\nOn 29 October 2009, Mr. Blum and Dr. Varga met with Dr. Mikl\u00f3s Kamar\u00e1s, the new CEO of the MNV, together with Dr. Morvai and other MNV officials, to discuss a draft cancellation letter that had been prepared pursuant to a direction from the Minister of Finance and, at the request of Mr. Blum, sent to Dr. Varga. By way of introduction, Dr. Kamar\u00e1s stated his view of the current status: \"[A].s *of today none of the real estates that appear in the swap agreement singed* [sic] *at the end of June 2008 were* *not* [sic] *registered on behalf of the parties of the agreement. At this moment the ownership situation is similar, there is a valid swap agreement, but no modifications in ownership occurred accordingly* \"121 Mr. Blum disagreed with Mr. Kamar\u00e0s\u2019 view, claiming that 16 properties had been registered in his name and that the delay in registration of the four remaining properties was the responsibility of the MNV. The parties disagreed on this point, which Dr. Kamar\u00e0s claimed was irrelevant to the meeting.122\n\n**Exhibit C-132.**\n\n**Exhibit C-132.**\n\n157.\n\nDr. Kamar\u00e0s referred to the recent valuation from which it appeared that the Pilis Land and Albertirsa Land owned by Mr. Blum had been overvalued. He concluded that, as a result of this new information, he, as the manager of the MNV, had immediately to take the necessary steps to avoid the damage. Dr. Kamar\u00e0s stated that the MNV had received from the Government *\"the mandate to restore the situation to its origins, yet to offer another site for exchange we are not allowed to do so\"123* Mr. Blum concluded that the purpose of the discussion for him was to minimize his damages and responded that he would send the MNV his proposal for modification of the cancellation agreement within 48 hours.124\n\n**Exhibit C-132;** Memorial, \u00b6 211.\n\n**Exhibit C-132;** Joint Chronology, item 186.\n\n158.\n\nIt appears from the record that Mr. Blum did not follow up with the MNV.\n\n159.\n\nOn 16 November 2009, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 ordered the MNV to initiate court proceedings *\"for the purpose of establishing the nullity of the swap transaction [...] due to a conspicuous disproportionality of value and restoration of the original condition.\"* He noted:\n\n*\"[s]pecial care must be taken to avoid the establishment of a damage compensation liability on the part of the Hungarian state and for this purpose, you should prudently present that the nullity has occurred due to reasons attributable to Joav Blum.\"125*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 212; **Exhibit C-133;** Joint Chronology, item 191.\n\n160.\n\nOn 17 November 2009, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 reported to Prime Minister Bajnai on the outcome of the internal investigation into the land swap. He stated that:\n\n- he was of the opinion that the uncertainty surrounding the existence of a public interest basis for the validity of the legal transaction was not in itself likely to be a sufficient legal foundation for challenging the validity of the transaction before a competent court;\n\n- the judicial expert opinion acquired in the criminal procedure underway at the Central Investigation Department of the Attorney General\u2019s Office had to be considered a new factor in the course of the investigation (the market value of the swap properties offered for the state-owned properties was determined to be only HUF 193,876,823 as opposed to HUF 787,400,000 set out in the Land Swap Agreement). Disproportionality between the service rendered and its compensation provided a basis for challenging the Land Swap Agreement and, as a consequence, for establishing its nullity;\n\n- he had requested that the NVT and MNV conduct negotiations with Mr. Blum with a view to terminating the Land Swap Agreement by mutual agreement; however, these negotiations had been unsuccessful because Mr. Blum intended to specify conditions - *e.g.,* the assumption of an unconditional damage compensation liability on behalf of the State, the detailed entitlement and amount of which was not specified in advance - which could not have been accepted; and\n\n- he had directed the NVT to take the relevant measures via the MNV in the court with relevant competency and jurisdiction, to *\"establish the nullity\"* of the Land Swap Agreement, on the basis of a *\"conspicuous disproportionality in value,\"* and thereby restore the original condition.126\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6215-216; **Exhibit C-134;** Joint Chronology, item 192.\n\n161.\n\nOn 18 November 2009, the MNV initiated a court case against Mr. Blum before the Fej\u00e9r County Court (number **P** 22597/2009) (the **\"Land Swap Litigation\"),** requesting the court:\n\n*\"[F]irstly according to Section (2), \u00a7200 of the Hungarian Civil Code (CC), secondly according to Section (2), \u00a7201 of CC, thirdly according to Section (3), \u00a7210 of CC* [to] *state firstly that the Exchange Contract defined in Section I violates a law provision, secondly that the value difference between the service and the consideration was remarkably great at the time of making the Exchange Contract defined in Section I, thirdly that the contracting parties laboured under the same faulty assumption regarding the exchange value and - as the legal consequence of invalidity for each alternative claim - we* *ask the restoration of the original status in accordance with Section (1), \u00a7237 of* CC.\"127\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 281; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 287; **Exhibit C-273;** Joint Chronology, item 193.\n\n162.\n\nThe MNV further requested the court to order reimbursement of the difference already paid and cancel any request for registration, cancel any ownership right of Mr. Blum already recorded and register the State\u2019s ownership right instead, and suspend any land registration procedures in progress.128\n\n**Exhibit C-273.**\n\n163.\n\nIn June 2010, the newly elected Prime Minister Orban appointed Dr. Gyula Budai, a Fidesz Member of Parliament, as the Commissioner of the Prime Minister responsible for the investigation of the unlawful sale and privatization of State lands.129 In November 2010, Dr. Budai was appointed *\"government commissioner\"* with a mandate to examine the use of public funds by central budgetary authorities and State-owned companies.130\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 241-242; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 241; **Exhibits R-179** and **C-160;** Joint Chronology, item 223.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 241; **Exhibit C-155;** Joint Chronology, item 268.\n\n**2. Postponement of the Signing of the Incentive Agreement and Revocation of Special Project Status**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Incentive Agreement**\n------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nOn 15 October 2009, Ms. Szandrocha, Director for Incentives & After Care at ITD Hungary, wrote to Mr. Blum referring to the need to request Governmental approval prior to the signing of the incentive agreement. Ms. Szandrocha stated that the agreement was ready for signing but *\"according to the latest government\u2019s decision, before we take the agreement for governmental approval we have to wait that the situation around te* [sic] *changing of the plots and the concession gets clarified\"131*\n\n**Exhibit C-187.**\n\n165.\n\nSimilarly, on 22 October 2009, Ms. Szandrocha wrote to Mr. Gaye, noting that the Ministry of National Development and Economy had confirmed that *\"the signing of the incentive agreement shall be postponed until the legal background of the changing of plots (Albertirsa - Sukoro) becomes clarified\"132*\n\n**Exhibit C-190;** Memorial, \u00b6 270; Joint Chronology, item 185.\n\n166.\n\nAn incentive agreement between Respondent and Claimant was ultimately never signed.133\n\nMemorial, \u00b6271.\n\n**b) Special Project Status**\n-----------------------------\n\n167.\n\nOn 13 September 2010, Mr. Andras Schiffer, the leader of the green liberal Party (LMP) and an opposition Member of Parliament, presented a question to the Government (a so-called *\"parliamentary interpellation\")* during the parliamentary session. He asked about the future envisaged by the Government for the Lake Velence region, as well as the priorities of the Government\u2019s development policy, and requested the revocation of Special Project Status that had been granted to facilitate the implementation of the Project in Sukoro.134\n\n**Exhibit C-145.**\n\n168.\n\nIn response, Dr. Gyorgy Matolcsy, Minister of National Economy, stated:\n\n*\"There will be no casino at Sukoro. We all know that [...] We know the personal interest of the Prime Minister, he likes the countryside, he likes the silken valleys and gentle hills round the Velence Mountains and Lake Velence [...] This is what we all like. Therefore, there will be no casino town or manufacturing town round the Lake Velence.\"135*\n\nMinister Matolcsy also announced that he had ordered the revocation of Special Project Status for the Project.136\n\n**Exhibit C-181.**\n\n**Exhibit C-181.**\n\n169.\n\nOn 14 September 2010, Dr. Kardkovacs, Deputy State Secretary at the Ministry of National Economy, prepared a proposal for the Government on the revocation of Special Project Status. The draft proposal stated:\n\n*\"According to the new plans of the government - based on environmental and touristic considerations - the casino town shall not be implemented at Sukoro. Instead, similarly to developed regions of Western Europe, such developments and changes shall take place which can provide a real possibility of recreation and resting.\"137*\n\nThe draft further provided that the public policy aim of the proposal was to put an end to the *\"land speculation in the region of Lake Velencei\"* and to revoke Special Project Status of the investment planned to be implemented on the outskirts of Sukoro.138\n\n**Exhibit R-94.**\n\n**Exhibit R-94.**\n\n170.\n\nOn 23 September 2010, Special Project Status for the Project was revoked by Government Decree, signed by Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n.139 During the meeting of the Administrative Secretaries of State on 16 September 2010 preceding the revocation, Dr. Roza Nagy, State Secretary at the Ministry of National Economy, presented the proposal as legislation of a *\"technical nature\"* on the basis that Special Project Status should have been revoked by the previous Government *\"further to the land swap agreement lawsuit, because no government could conceivably support the implementation of an investment project on unlawfully obtained land.\"140*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 262; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 246; **Exhibit C-182;** Joint Chronology, item 250.\n\nNagy, \u00b6 15.\n\n171.\n\nOn 15 October 2010, Mr. Langhammer wrote to Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n, expressing his *\"disappointment\"* at the revocation of Special Project Status and stating: \"[I]t *is of crucial importance to know that your Government remains committed to the development of this project\"* Mr. Langhammer clarified that *\"Vigotop Limited Investors (Mr. F H Langhammer, Mr. I Fisher and Mr. R S Lauder), have no connection with the ownership of the Sukoro land.\"141*\n\n**Exhibit C-152;** Joint Chronology, item 258.\n\n172.\n\nOn 18 October 2010, Mr. Benkley, Managing Director of KC Bidding, wrote to Minister Matolcsy expressing *\"great surprise\"* at the cancellation of Special Project Status without any warning or explanation, asking Minister Matolcsy to *\"reconsider* [his] *decision and to restore the original situation.\"142*\n\n**Exhibit C-299;** Joint Chronology, item 259.\n\n173.\n\nOn 21 October 2010, Mr. Gaye also wrote to Dr. Fellegi, Minister of National Development, expressing his *\"great surprise\"* at the cancellation of Special Project Status and calling upon Minister Fellegi to reconsider the Government\u2019s decision and to restore the original situation.143\n\n**Exhibit C-183;** Joint Chronology, item 260.\n\n174.\n\nOn 4 November 2010, Mr. P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, spokesman for Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n, replied to Mr. Langhammer\u2019s letter of 15 October 2010, stating that *\"I respectfully suggest we postpone the meeting proposed by you until the appropriate termination of the proceedings put in place by the Hungarian authorities\"* in connection with the land swap, and noting that *\"any meeting between the Prime Minister and those involved would give grounds for the worst assumptions \"144*\n\n**Exhibit C-153;** Joint Chronology, item 265.\n\n**3. Performance of the Concession Contract**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Submission of Suretyship**\n-------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nOn 19 November 2009, Dr. Bard, acting on behalf of KC Bidding, submitted to the Ministry of Finance the declaration of Mr. Lauder on the assumption of joint and several suretyship in accordance with Section 12.4 of the Concession Contract (the **\"Suretyship\")** and requested acknowledgement of *\"the performance of the foregoing guarantee obligation.\"145* The Suretyship provided that (i) the guarantee was valid during the period 1 January 2010 to 31 March 2011, (ii) the maximum liability was the sum of HUF 936 million, and (iii) the guarantee could be exercised only in the event that a written demand was provided to KC Bidding, with a copy to Mr. Lauder, detailing the unfulfilled financial undertaking of KC Bidding and providing a 30 day period for such undertaking to be fulfilled.146\n\n**Exhibit R-78;** Joint Chronology, item 195.\n\n**Exhibit C-204.**\n\n176.\n\nOn 9 December 2009, Mr. Arvai, from the Ministry of Finance, wrote to Dr. Bard stating: *\"I wish to inform you that the suretyship meets the requirements under paragraph 12.4 of the concession agreement signed between KC Bidding Kft. and the State of Hungary of the 9th of October 2009, no objection has been raised with respect to the identity of the guarantor \"147*\n\n**Exhibit R-79.** This is an amended and certified translation of **Exhibit C-206,** which had been submitted by Claimant and reads in relevant part: \"7 *wish to inform you that the suretyship is acceptable and no objections have been raised according to paragraph 12.4 of the concession agreement signed between KC Bidding Kft. and the State of Hungary on the 9th of October 20092* Joint Chronology, item 197.\n\n177.\n\nOn 25 January 2010, Mr. Benkley wrote to Dr. Oszko stating that KC Bidding had performed the obligations stipulated under the Concession Contract, including, *inter alia,* the submission of the declaration on the assumption of joint and several suretyship, and requested that the Minister confirm the performance of the obligations.148\n\n**Exhibit R-80;** Joint Chronology, item 204.\n\n178.\n\nOn 5 March 2010, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 responded to Mr. Benkley noting that \"[n]o *objections have been raised with regard to the performance of these contractual obligations, as* yet.\"149\n\n**Exhibit R-82;** Joint Chronology, item 209.

On 9 November 2009, Claimant engaged Artonic Design Kft., a local architecture firm, to assist with the search for alternative sites.154 On 25 February 2010, Claimant engaged Miller Buckfire & Co., LLC **(\"Miller Buckfire\"),** an investment bank and advisory firm, to assist in finding a strategic investor to join the Project.155 Claimant has described its search for three sites in some detail, namely atB\u00e1bolna, Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and Tatab\u00e1nya.156\n\nReply, \u00b6 69; **Exhibit C-278;** Joint Chronology, item 188.\n\n**Exhibit C-43;** Joint Chronology, item 207.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 223-229.\n\n182.\n\nFor reasons that will be discussed below, Claimant ultimately did not acquire any of these alternative sites.\n\n**d) Efforts to Meet with Members of the Fidesz Government**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nFollowing the national elections in April 2010 and the election of Dr. Orb\u00e1n as Prime Minister on 29 May 2010, the Project Sponsors repeatedly requested meetings with members of the Fidesz Government, including Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n. For reasons that will be discussed below, none of these requests were successful.\n\n184.\n\nThe Project Sponsors also repeatedly requested that the new Fidesz Government confirm that it would still support the Project.\n\n185.\n\nOn 16 September 2010, Mr. Gaye wrote a letter to Mr. Tam\u00e1s Kocsis, Deputy-Chief of Cabinet in the Ministry of National Development, noting that *\"in order to move forward the support of your Ministry is needed\u2019* and seeking clarification as to the Ministry\u2019s attitude toward the Project.157 According to Claimant, this letter was handed to Mr. Kocsis at a meeting between Messrs.

The Tribunal notes that Respondent does not take this position in its Counter-Memorial, in which it submits: *\"On 16 September 2010, Mr. Gaye informed the Ministry of National Development that the Project Sponsors were still* \u2018busy looking for a new location for the resort in the Central Transdanubian region\u2019. *Mr. Gaye requested some* \u2018clarifications as for the status of the King\u2019s City project and the Ministry\u2019s attitude towards the materialization of the project in Hungary\u2019, *but did not otherwise refer to any potential locations that the Project Sponsors might have been considering, or solicit the government\u2019s assistance in securing any particular site.\"* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 249.\n\n186.\n\nOn 24 November 2010, Mr. Langhammer wrote a letter to Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n, in which he complained about *\"a consistent course of conduct by Hungary since late 2009 that appears designed to undermine our legal rights and destroy the King\u2019s City project.\"* Mr. Langhammer gave the following examples: (i) the Government refused to sign the agreement providing incentives for the Project Sponsors\u2019 investment; (ii) the Government commenced a series of civil and criminal proceedings against Mr. Blum in connection with the Land Swap Agreement; (iii) the Government appointed a commissioner, Dr. Budai, who had *\"continuously and virulently attacked the King\u2019s City project and Vigotop Limited\u2019s investors and has rendered impossible KC Bidding Kft\u2019s attempts to secure legitimate possession of alternative sites for the project\" ;* (iv) the Government cancelled the Project\u2019s Special Project Status; and (v) the Minister of National Economy demanded that KC Bidding pay penalties following purported violations of the Concession Contract. Mr. Langhammer concluded that, without a *\"formal, explicit and immediate assurance that Hungary remains committed to the project, and to fulfilling its obligations and previous assurances in connection with the project, the project will fail,\"* and requested from the Government\n\n*\"your written confirmation of the following:*\n\n*1.

That Hungary will agree to extend by 12 months the 1 January 2011 deadline in the concession agreement for the taking of legitimate possession of an appropriate site for the project. This will require amendment to, inter alia, clause 9.3 and clause 9.4 of the agreement.

To this end, on 20 December 2010, KC Bidding and SDI Europe entered into an agreement regarding the assignment of specific rights, possession of and the right to build on the Leased Real Properties, based on the Lease Agreement (the **\"Assignment Agreement\"),163** and, on 21 December 2010, KC Bidding (as transferor) and SDI Europe (as transferee) signed and effected the Handover Protocol relating to the Leased Real Properties.164\n\nMemorial, note 41, **Exhibit C-II;** Joint Chronology, item 284.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 272; **Exhibit R-104;** Joint Chronology, item 285.\n\n191.\n\nOn 21 December 2010, Mr. Paul Benkley, Managing Director of KC Bidding, informed Minister Matolcsy that SDI Europe had acquired legitimate possession of, and the right to build on, the Leased Real Properties, and that KC Bidding had accordingly complied with its obligations under Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract.165\n\nMemorial, **\u00b6 300; Exhibit C-203;** Joint Chronology, item 287.\n\n**4. Termination of the Concession Contract**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nUpon receipt of Mr. Benkley\u2019s letter of 21 December 2010, a meeting was held on 6 January 2011 among Dr. Budai, representatives of the Ministry of National Economy, the Ministry of National Development and the Government Control Office and the attorney engaged by Hungary in the pending Land Swap Litigation regarding the letter and the potential grounds for the termination of the Concession Contract.166 Dr. Kard-kov\u00e1cs, the Deputy Secretary of State, and Dr. K\u00f3r\u00f3smezei, the chief head of department, sent a memo regarding the meeting to Minister Matolcsy proposing, *inter alia,* to *\"terminate the concession contract with immediate effect and to enforce the state\u2019s claim for a penalty for frustration deriving therefrom\"* and attaching a draft termination letter.167\n\n**Exhibit R-160;** Joint Chronology, item 291.\n\n**Exhibit R-160.**\n\n193.\n\nBy letter of 10 January 2011, Minister Matolcsy notified Mr. Benkley of the termination of the Concession Contract with immediate effect and requested payment in the amount of HUF 900 million as a cancellation penalty pursuant to Clause 12.5.1 (the **\"Termination Letter\").** The Termination Letter was delivered to KC Bidding on 12 January 2011.168 Minister Matolcsy specified three grounds for the termination of the Concession Contract:\n\n(i) The concession receiver had failed to comply with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract, namely that it must *\"hold the legitimate right to possession of the real properties for establishment of the Casino\"* As the Concession Company had been established and registered in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, which was also its principal place of business, the settlement community indicated by the concession receiver for practicing the concession activity was Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. However, the concession receiver had only filed documents for the purpose of certifying the possession of real properties in Sukor\u00f3. This failure served as a basis for the concession grantor\u2019s right to termination with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.1.\n\n(ii) Even if the concession receiver had specified Sukor\u00f3 instead of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r as the location for practicing the concession activity, the documents provided did not properly comply with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract. According to the deed of ownership, the owner of the real properties in Sukor\u00f3 was the State of Hungary and not Mr. Blum, who had entered into the Lease Agreement with KC Bidding. The Assignment Agreement between KC Bidding and SDI Europe was therefore null and void and hence could not support legitimate ownership and building rights of SDI Europe with regard to the Sukor\u00f3 Site.\n\n(iii) As an independent ground for termination pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.22, Mr. Lauder\u2019s statement of guarantee, which included *\"limitations of temporal [...] and pecuniary [...] nature,\"* failed to satisfy Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract, which requires security for the payment obligations arising from the Contract.169\n\nJoint Chronology, item 297.\n\n**Exhibit C-202; Exhibit R-lll**\n\n**F. Litigation following the Termination of the Concession Contract**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Land Swap Litigation**\n---------------------------\n\n194.\n\nIn the Land Swap Litigation that had been pending since 18 November 2009, the Fej\u00e9r County Court at first instance held on 16 December 2011 that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void on the basis that the contractual intent on the part of the Hunganan State was false and that Mr. Blum *\"should have known\"* this. For this reason, the public interest requirement set out in Section 13(4) of the National Land Fund Act for the avoidance of a public tender was absent. The Court further held that the Sukoro Site should have been acquired by way of a public tender and that the Land Swap Agreement was therefore concluded in breach of Section 13(1) of the National Land Fund Act.170 In addition, the Court found that the Land Swap Agreement was void under Section 201(2) of the Civil Code *\"due to the grossly unfair difference between the value of the services and the value of the consideration\"171*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 289; **Exhibit R-127;** Joint Chronology, item 329.\n\n**Exhibit R-127**\n\n195.\n\nOn 20 January 2012, Mr. Blum filed an appeal against the decision of the Fej\u00e9r County Court with the Metropolitan Court of Appeal.\n\n196.\n\nOn 13 June 2012, the Metropolitan Court of Appeal upheld the F\u00e9jer County Court\u2019s decision and dismissed Mr. Blum\u2019s appeal. It held that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void on the basis that the parties had sought to circumvent Section 13(1) of the National Land Fund Act, as the parties\u2019 real intention was not to secure a site for the road project, but rather to ensure that the Sukoro Site could be acquired by Mr. Blum without a public tender. The public interest requirement was therefore absent. As regards the contractual intent of the parties, the Metropolitan Court of Appeal stated: *\"The contractual intention of the parties was not sham, therefore the contract itself is not a sham contract.\"172*\n\n**Exhibit R-129;** Joint Chronology, item 339.\n\n197.\n\nOn 16 July 2012, Mr. Blum filed a request for an extraordinary revision procedure with the *Curia,* the Supreme Court of Hungary.173\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 301.\n\n198.\n\nOn 13 November 2012, the **Curia** affirmed the previous decisions of the Fej\u00e9r County Court and the Metropolitan Court of Appeal, ordering the restoration of the original conditions existing prior to the swap and declaring the Land Swap Agreement null and void.174 It decided on the basis that the swap was not justified because the criteria under Section 13(4) of the National Land Fund Act are not met where the properties in question are only partially affected by the infrastructure development and that the effect of the M4 motorway on Mr. Blum\u2019s properties, *i.e.,* the Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land, was *\"minimal.\"175* As the **Curia** confirmed that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void, it did not consider it necessary to examine the merits of the other reasons of invalidity.176\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 301; **Exhibit R-131.**\n\nJoint Chronology, item 347.\n\n**Exhibit R-131,** p. 23.\n\n**2.

Respondent had notified KC Bidding of its failure to comply with its reporting obligations specified under Clause 14.3 of the Concession Contract and requested payment of the default penalty under Clause 12.5.5 thereof. **Exhibit R-98.** In addition, on 7 January 2011, Respondent again requested KC Bidding to make payment of penalties and interest for late performance. **Exhibit C-209.**\n\nReply, \u00b6 117; **Exhibit R-120;** Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 283; Joint Chronology, item 307.\n\n200.\n\nOn 30 March 2011, KC Bidding commenced parallel proceedings against Respondent in the Central Court of Pest District, requesting a declaration that the termination of the Concession Contract was unlawful (the **\"Termination Proceedings\").181**\n\nReply, \u00b6 117; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 284.\n\n201.\n\nOn 10 August 2011, KC Bidding filed a request for the suspension of the Penalty Proceedings.

Summary of Claimant\u2019s Contentions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent has taken a series of unlawful measures in breach of Article 4 of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, culminating in the cancellation of the Concession Contract on 10 January 2011. These measures include (but are not limited to) *\"the Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions preventing the Claimant from securing the land required for the Project, the Respondent\u2019s frustration of the Claimant\u2019s attempts to find alternative land, the Respondent\u2019s withdrawal of a package of incentives it had offered to the Project, and the revocation of the Special Project Status.\"186* Claimant claims that it has incurred losses as a result of such breach and seeks compensation from Respondent.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 678. *Cf.* RfA, \u00b6 60.\n\n205.\n\nClaimant contends that the termination of the Concession Contract amounted to an expropriation within the meaning of Article 4 of the Treaty in that the termination *\"rendered the Claimant\u2019s realization of the value of its investment in the King\u2019s City Project impossible\"187* and was, together with the Respondent\u2019s *\"many* [other] *unlawful acts,\"* not justified because there was no *\"reasonable relationship of proportionality between the charge or weight imposed\u2019* on Claimant *\"and the aim sought to be realized\u2019* by Respondent.188\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 525.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 542.\n\n206.\n\nMore specifically, Claimant submits that by virtue of these measures, Respondent acted *\"arbitrarily, inconsistently, without transparency, lacking good faith and in violation of the Claimant\u2019s legitimate investment-backed expectations.\"189* In this context, Claimant relies on investment treaty jurisprudence in its submission that violations of other standards of investment protection, such as the fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard (Article 3(1) of the Treaty), protection against unreasonable and discriminatory measures (also Article 3(1)) and the full security and protection standard (Article 3(2)) may inform the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of unlawful expropriation.190\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 514; *cf.* \u00b6\u00b6 493-521.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 493; *cf.* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 33.\n\n207.\n\nFurther, Claimant relies on the principles of good faith and *pacta sunt servanda,* which, Claimant contends, constitute fundamental principles of international law that *\"inform all of these treaty standards\"* Claimant is of the view that Respondent\u2019s conduct manifestly violated those principles and submits that the absence of good faith may indicate that there has been a breach of one or more of the standards of investment treaty protection, including expropriation.191\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 494.\n\n208.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent has breached the above principles in particular by;\n\n(i) the *\"severe lack of transparency* [which] *tainted the Respondent\u2019s conduct in general, both in the lead up to and after the signature of the Concession Contract,\"192* including the issue of a press release immediately following signature of the Concession Contract, announcing Respondent\u2019s aim to restore the original ownerships of the properties exchanged pursuant to the Land Swap Agreement;193\n\n(ii) the initiation of court proceedings in order to nullify the Land Swap Agreement194 and the initiation of criminal investigations against former officials who had been associated with the Project;195\n\n(iii) the refusal of ITD Hungary to sign an incentive agreement;196\n\n(iv) the revocation of Special Project Status;197\n\n(v) the *\"stonewalling of the Project Sponsors\"* by refusing to meet with them throughout 2010;198\n\n(vi) the refusal to extend the contractual deadline for securing a site for the Project;199\n\n(vii) the attempt by Respondent to justify its conduct with allegations of corruption and scandal;200\n\n(viii) the failure of Respondent\u2019s authorities to properly complete the tract formation procedure concerning the Sukoro Site;201 and\n\n(ix) the termination of the Concession Contract on the basis of *\"improper and invalid reasons\"202* which were in part *\"the result of the Respondent\u2019s own culpable actions and omissions,\"* namely the acts and omissions that *\"thwartedMr. Blum\u2019s efforts to register his ownership of the land\"* and the frustration of *\"the Project Sponsors\u2019 attempts to secure an alternative site for the Project.\"203*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6511-512.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 48.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 505.\n\n*Cf.* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 573 *et seq.*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 503.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 504.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 78 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 91 et *seq.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 99 *et seq.*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 505.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 506-510.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 509.\n\n209.\n\nClaimant further submits that Respondent carried out an *\"aggressive media campaign\"* against Claimant, the Project Sponsors and the King\u2019s City Project following the national elections in April 2010.204\n\n*Cf.* Memorial, \u00b6 513.\n\n210.\n\nClaimant relies on the concept of a *\"creeping expropriation\"* and submits that the Tribunal must examine each of Respondent\u2019s acts against the broader chronology of events. Claimant submits that Respondent\u2019s actions destroyed Claimant\u2019s legitimate investment-backed expectations and that their cumulative effect constituted an expropriation.205\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 134, 118 *et seq.*\n\n211.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s submission that, when viewed in their totality, Respondent\u2019s actions support the conclusion that Respondent acted in its sovereign capacity, rather than as an ordinary commercial counterparty.206\n\n*Cf.* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 144 *et seq.*\n\n212.\n\nClaimant further submits that in determining whether there has been an expropriation within the meaning of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, the Tribunal *\"must exercise its own judgment,\"* irrespective of the legality of the Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions under Hungarian domestic law,207 particularly with regard to the outcome of the Land Swap Litigation and the Termination Proceedings before the Hungarian courts. Claimant contends that it is a fundamental principle of international law that a State cannot excuse its breach of international law by reference to its own domestic laws.208\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 368-369.\n\nReply, \u00b6 22.\n\n213.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent\u2019s measures, in depriving Claimant of its investment, violate Article 4 of the Treaty because Respondent has failed to satisfy any of the four conditions for a lawful expropriation under Article 4(1) (a)-(d) of the Treaty. Claimant contends that Respondent\u2019s measures were *\"contrary to the public interest,\" \"did not provide due process of law,\" \"were discriminatory\"* and *\"made no provision for the payment of just compensation in respect of the expropriation of Vigotop\u2019s investment.\"209*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 548-549.\n\n214.\n\nClaimant seeks compensation for losses in the amount of not less than EUR 312.6 million (using the trading multiples approach), EUR 293.5 million (using the income approach) or EUR 278.3 million (using the comparable transactions approach), depending on the valuation methodology that the Tribunal chooses to apply.210 Claimant submits that under customary international law, reparation must, so far as possible, wipe out all consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if the wrongful act had not been committed. This is the principle set out in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case,211 which Claimant claims is also incorporated in Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles.212\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 424.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 600; *The Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v.

Article 4(2) provides that *\"the amount of compensation must correspond to the market value of the expropriated investment at the moment of expropriation\"213*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 607.\n\n216.\n\nNevertheless, Claimant submits that the preponderance of international awards and judgments have recognized that a different standard of compensation applies to lawful and unlawful expropriations. It argues that, following the decision of the tribunal in *ADC* v. *Hungary* which concerns unlawful expropriation under the Treaty, the standard under customary international law should apply.214\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 609; *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

Summary of Respondent\u2019s Contentions**\n------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nRespondent submits that Hungary did not expropriate Claimant\u2019s investment but rather fully complied with its obligations under both domestic law and the Treaty.223\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 304-458.\n\n222.\n\nRespondent contends that recourse to Treaty standards other than Article 4 of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT is not permitted in assessing expropriation claims under this provision, as Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty provide for different and separate Treaty standards and Article 7 unambiguously restricts the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to expropriation claims.224\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 317-334.\n\n223.\n\nWith regard to the alleged expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment, Respondent submits that the Concession Contract gave Respondent a contractual right of termination, which Respondent, acting as an ordinary contracting party, invoked on 10 January 2011.225 Respondent claims that, as Claimant was free to dispute the legality of the termination and has in fact done so by bringing proceedings for wrongful termination before the Hungarian courts, there can be no finding of an expropriation, on the grounds that Claimant\u2019s contractual remedies remain available.226\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 341; *cf.* Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 213 *et seq.*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 341.\n\n224.\n\nRespondent contends that, in any event, it terminated the Concession Contract in accordance with both its terms and Hungarian law and that the termination of the Concession Contract therefore cannot constitute an expropriation.227\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 342.\n\n225.\n\nIn particular, Respondent argues that Mr. Blum could not have acquired valid legal title to the Sukor\u00f3 Site constituting *\"legitimate possession\";* no rights or obligations could be derived from the Land Swap Agreement because it was, as now confirmed by the *Curia,* null and void *ab initio228* Respondent further submits that the suspicious conditions in which the Land Swap Agreement was concluded explain why Hungary considered the Land Swap Agreement to be invalid even prior to the confirmation by a court decision.229\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 371; *cf. \u00b6\u00b6* 286-303.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 90.\n\n226.\n\nRespondent contends that it did not cause the grounds for termination in any way. Respondent submits that KC Bidding failed to secure a Project site in Sukor\u00f3 for reasons unrelated to Respondent and claims that the Project Sponsors were aware from the outset of the likely unavailability of the Sukor\u00f3 Site but nevertheless chose it as the Project site for reasons unknown to Respondent.230\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 301.\n\n227.\n\nRespondent claims that Dr. Oszk\u00f3 acted transparently during the preparation and conclusion of the Concession Contract, particularly with regard to the Land Swap Agreement,231 and that the Project Sponsors were kept informed of all relevant developments.232\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 423.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 341.\n\n228.\n\nWith regard to Claimant\u2019s argument that the termination was a disproportionate response to what were relatively minor contractual breaches, Respondent argues that Claimant\u2019s breach related to one of KC Bidding\u2019s core obligations under the Concession Contract, namely to find an appropriate site for the Project.233\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 404.\n\n229.\n\nIn response to the alleged violations of the good faith principle by its pre-termination conduct, Respondent submits that its conduct was at all times in good faith, and that none of Respondent\u2019s acts deprived Claimant of its investment.234\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 337.\n\n230.\n\nIn relation to the failed tract formation procedure, Respondent claims that while Claimant may have experienced some inefficiency as regards the administrative process of the Hungarian bureaucracy, these problems did not rise to the level of a violation of any provision of the Treaty, let alone expropriation.235 In any event, the need for the tract formation procedure derived from the Land Swap Agreement, which was found null and void *ab initio* by the Hungarian courts; any issue that arose out of the tract formation procedure was thus rendered moot.236\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 430.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6431.\n\n231.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimant\u2019s claimed expectations relating to the financial incentive package offered to the Project Sponsors and the Special Project Status are baseless. ITD Hungary\u2019s incentive proposal was premised on the implementation of the Project at Sukoro and remained subject to the final approval of the Government.237 Similarly, Special Project Status would only have been applicable if the Project had proceeded at Sukoro.238\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 359.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 444.\n\n232.\n\nWith regard to Claimant\u2019s submissions on the alleged media campaign, Respondent contends that those events cannot be attributed to Respondent.239 Respondent asserts that the investigations relating to the Land Swap Agreement did not target the Project and had no bearing on Respondent\u2019s decision to terminate the Concession Contract.240 As regards the legislative changes allegedly aimed at destroying the Project, Respondent similarly asserts that they did not target Claimant or the Project and did not contribute in any way to the alleged expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment.241\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 452.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 448.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 456-457.\n\n233.\n\nIn response to Claimant\u2019s contention that the Project could not have been realized without active State support, Respondent submits that there is no obligation under international law to actively support foreign investments and contends that omissions, however egregious, are not sufficient to constitute an expropriation.242\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 272, 274.\n\n234.\n\nWith regard to Claimant\u2019s submissions on quantum, Respondent answers that Claimant is not entitled to any compensation.243 According to Respondent, Claimant has not met its burden of showing that the allegedly lost future profits were *\"probable.\"244* As of 10 January 2011, the King\u2019s City Project was nothing more than a desktop conceptual study, unsupported by any market data or feasibility study.245\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 459.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 461.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 462.\n\n235.\n\nRespondent submits that the Project only had a remote chance of materializing because (i) there is no proven, existing market for a mega-casino resort in Europe; (ii) the Project Sponsors had no expertise in developing and operating a casino and failed to find a strategic partner interested in investing in and operating the Project; and (iii) the Project might not have been *\"bankable,\"* especially in light of the financial crisis.246\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 461-482.\n\n236.\n\nNor, according to Respondent, has Claimant met its burden of proving the quantum of its alleged loss.247 Respondent submits that the DCF method is consistently rejected as a methodology, to value undeveloped projects, such as King\u2019s City, that are not going concerns and lack a record of profitability.248\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 483.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 489.\n\n237.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Abdala\u2019s DCF method contains flaws which, when corrected, yield a much lower fair market value, if not a negative value.249 These include overly optimistic revenue projections,250 understated projections of development and operating costs,251 and a discount rate that ignores the Project\u2019s high risk of failure.252\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 502.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 503-507.\n\nCounter-Memorial,\u00b6\u00b6 508-513.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 514-517.\n\n238.\n\nWith respect to the alternative valuations, Respondent submits that the market-based valuations offer no validation for Dr. Abdala\u2019s valuation opinion.253 Respondent claims that the comparator companies and transactions are insufficiently similar to the investment to be valued254 and the trading multiples valuation is circular.255\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 525.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 527.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 531.\n\n239.\n\nRespondent argues that Dr. Abdala\u2019s valuation opinion is contradicted by contemporaneous arm\u2019s length-transactions, such as the 2009 Dream Island Transaction in Budapest and the proposed Euro Vegas project in 2007, the Miller Buckfire engagement letter with Vigotop, the Concession Contract itself and the 2008 Option Agreement between Vigotop and ACC, the minority shareholder in KC Bidding.256\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 533-546.\n\n240.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that in any event Claimant failed to mitigate its loss, a duty firmly established under international law.257\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 547-551.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Request for Relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent requests that the Arbitral Tribunal issue an award:258\n\n(i) dismissing Claimant\u2019s claims in their entirety;\n\n(ii) declaring that Respondent did not expropriate Claimant\u2019s investment in Hungary;\n\n(iii) ordering Claimant to bear all costs incurred by Respondent in connection with this arbitration, including without limitation the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, attorneys\u2019 fees, fees of expert witnesses, and the charges for use of the facilities of the Centre; and\n\n(iv) ordering any further relief that it may deem appropriate.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 576; Respondent did not amend its Request for Relief in its Post-Hearing Brief, *cf.* \u00b6 376.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S REASONING**\n--------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nBy way of introduction, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has carefully reviewed all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties during the course of these proceedings. Although the Tribunal may not address all such arguments and evidence in full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless considered and taken them into account in arriving at its decision.\n\n**A. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n**1. General Jurisdictional Requirements**\n------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction derives from Article 25 of the ICSID Convention in connection with the relevant provisions of the Treaty.\n\n244.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention provides, in its relevant part:\n\n*\"(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*\n\n*(2)* \u2018National of another Contracting State\u2019 *means:*\n\n*(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and*\n\n*(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\"*\n\n245.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention sets out four requirements for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction: (i) the existence of a legal dispute; (ii) a dispute arising directly out of an *\"investment\u2019;* (iii) a dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State; and (iv) the existence of the written consent of both Parties. It is common ground between the Parties that all four conditions are met in the present case.\n\n**a) Existence of a Legal Dispute**\n-----------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Parties agree that there is a legal dispute relating to Respondent\u2019s alleged violations of the Treaty and Claimant\u2019s claimed corresponding right to compensation for the losses it incurred as a result of such violations.\n\n**b) Dispute Arising Directly Out of an Investment**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention does not define the term *\"investment\u2019;* however, a definition can be found in Article 1(1) of the Treaty which reads in its relevant part:\n\n*\"1. The term* \u2018investments\u2019 *shall comprise every kind of asset connected with the participation in companies and joint ventures, more particularly, though not exclusively:*\n\n[...]\n\n*(b) rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies;*\n\n248.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that Claimant\u2019s investment in the territory of Respondent consisted of its shareholdings in its two Hungarian subsidiaries, KC Bidding (in which it held 75% of the shares) and KC Management (in which it held 100% of the shares), as well as KC Bidding\u2019s rights under the Concession Contract.259\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 426-427; *cf.* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 20; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 210.\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant submits that its investment further consisted of a series of contracts and other rights related to the Project, and in particular contends that *\"KC Bidding also held contractual rights to the Sukor\u00f3 site by virtue of the Land Swap Agreement and associated Lease Agreements, which [...] remained valid at the valuation date,\"260* whereas Respondent is of the view that Claimant\u2019s investment is limited to the assets set out in the previous paragraph.261 With regard to its jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers it sufficient that the Parties agree that Claimant has indeed made an investment within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the Treaty, which comprises (at least) its shareholdings in KC Bidding and KC Management and KC Bidding\u2019s rights under the Concession Contract.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 23.\n\n*Cf* Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 210.\n\n250.\n\nFurther, it is not disputed that Claimant is an investor within the meaning of Article l(3)(b) of the Treaty which provides that the term *\"investor\"* includes *\"legal persons constituted or incorporated in compliance with the law of that Contracting Party\"* It is undisputed that Claimant was incorporated on 25 October 2008 and is a legal person constituted in accordance with the laws of Cyprus.262\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 424-425.\n\n251.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Treaty does not protect *\"investors\"* independently of their *\"investment,\"* nor does it protect a *\"right to invest\"263* Claimant confirms that it does not seek relief for the violation of any *\"right to invest,\"* but that its claim relates only to Respondent\u2019s alleged deprivation of investments that had already been made before Respondent\u2019s alleged misconduct took place.264\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 26; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 210.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 28.\n\n252.\n\nIt is therefore undisputed that, with regard to Claimant\u2019s shareholdings in KC Bidding and KC Management, as well as KC Bidding\u2019s rights under the Concession Contract, the legal dispute between the Parties arises directly out of an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**c) Dispute Between a Contracting State and a National of Another Contracting State**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nIt is also common ground between the Parties that the dispute is between a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention and a national of another Contracting State. Hungary is a Contracting State for the purposes of Article 25(1) because Hungary ratified the ICSID Convention on 4 February 1987 and the Convention entered into force for Hungary on 6 March 1987. Vigotop is a national of another Contracting State within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and in accordance with the nationality requirement set out in Article 1(3)(b) of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, because it is a company constituted under the laws of Cyprus. Cyprus ratified the ICSID Convention on 25 November 1966, and it came into force for Cyprus on 25 December 1966.265\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 442.\n\n**d) Existence of the Written Consent of Both Parties**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nBoth Parties have consented in writing to submit their dispute to the ICSID for arbitration. Respondent gave its consent in writing by way of Article 7 of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, such consent becoming effective upon the entry into force of the Treaty on 25 May 1990, prior to the actions/omissions of Respondent giving rise to this dispute.266 Article 7 provides that an investor may request arbitration of the dispute if it cannot be settled *\"within six months from the date either party requested amicable settlement.\"* Claimant complied with Article 7 by notifying Respondent of the dispute in writing on 17 January 2011 and inviting Respondent to settle the dispute amicably. Claimant then submitted the dispute to arbitration after the expiry of the cooling-off period, namely on 18 July 2011.267 In submitting its Request for Arbitration on 18 July 2011, Claimant consented in writing to submit the dispute to the ICSID for arbitration.268\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 432-433.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 438-443.\n\nRfA, \u00b6 31.\n\n255.\n\nAs all four requirements are met in this case, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the present case has been established on the basis of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Articles 1 and 7 of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT.\n\n**2. Scope of Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------\n\n256.\n\nThe Parties agree that the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is determined by Article 7 of the Treaty, which provides:\n\n\"1. *Any dispute between either Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting Party concerning expropriation of an investment shall, as far as possible, be settled by the disputing parties in an amicable way.*\n\n*If such dispute cannot be settled within six months from the date either party requested amicable settlement, it shall, upon request of the investor, be submitted to one of the following:*\n\n*(a) The Arbitration Institute of the Arbitral Tribunal of the Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm;*\n\n*(b) the Arbitral Tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris;*\n\n*(c) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes in case both Contracting Parties have become members of the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States.\"*\n\n257.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that Article 7 of the Treaty limits the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to the consideration of claims relating to expropriation.269 Claimant also confirms that, although it is of the view that non-expropriation standards of protection under the Treaty or under customary international law may be relevant to the finding of an expropriation, it does not raise any separate cause of action in relation to such non-expropriation standards.270\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 15; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 20.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 17.\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal notes Respondent\u2019s view that, in adjudicating claims of unlawful expropriation under Article 4 of the Treaty, the Tribunal need not - and must not - have recourse to other standards of investment protection.271 However, as Claimant expressly raises only expropriation claims, the Tribunal considers that the potential relevance of the alleged violation of non-expropriation standards to its decision on the expropriation claim is an issue for the merits, rather than jurisdiction.\n\n*Cf.* Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 22.\n\n**B. Standard of Protection Against Expropriation under the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nArticle 4 of the Treaty sets out the standard of protection against expropriation. It provides:\n\n\"1. *Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:*\n\n*(a) The measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;*\n\n*(b) the measures are not discriminatory;*\n\n*(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of just compensation.*\n\n*2. The amount of compensation must correspond to the market value of the expropriated investments at the moment of the expropriation.*\n\n*3. The amount of this compensation may be estimated according to the laws and regulations of the country where the expropriation is made.*\n\n*4. The compensation must be paid without undue delay upon completion of the legal expropriation procedure, but not later than three months upon completion of this procedure and shall be transferred in the currency in which the investment is made. In the event of delay beyond the three-months\u2019 period, the Contracting Party concerned shall be liable to the payment of interest based on prevailing rates.*\n\n*5. Investors of either Contracting Party who suffer losses of their investments in the territory of the other Contracting State due to war or other armed conflict or state of emergency in the territory of the other Contracting Party, shall be treated, with respect to the compensation for these losses, as investors of any third State.\"*\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nClaimant submits that the use of the term *\"deprivation\"* in Article 4(1) of the Treaty is equivalent to the term *\"expropriation\"* in customary international law. According to Claimant, measures of deprivation constitute a *\"taking'* of private property by the State without the owner\u2019s consent and there is no requirement that the *\"taking\u2019* benefit the State concerned, or that it benefit any third party.272\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 489-490.\n\n261.\n\nClaimant argues that measures of deprivation can be direct or indirect. In relation to indirect expropriation, Claimant refers to the cases of *CME Czech Republic N. V. v. Czech Republic* in which the tribunal held that measures will constitute indirect expropriation when they *\"do not involve an overt taking but [...] effectively neutralize the benefit of the property of the foreign owner,\"273* as well as *Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States* in which the tribunal held that an indirect expropriation will occur when the measures have *\"the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in* *significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property* \".274\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award (13 September 2001), **Exhibit CLA-9, \u00b6** 604.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 490; *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l, Award (30 August 2000), **Exhibit CLA-7, \u00b6** 103.\n\n262.\n\nClaimant submits that an indirect expropriation may manifest itself as a *\"creeping expropriation,\"* whereby the investor\u2019s rights are devalued by virtue of a number of acts or omissions of a host State that cumulatively destroy the investment.275 Claimant refers to the case of *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* in which the tribunal affirmed that it should consider *\"the effect of individual, isolated, acts complained of, as well [...] the cumulative effect of a series of individual acts, in so far as such a cumulative effect might be to deprive the investor in whole or in material part of the use or economic benefit of its assets.\"276*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 119; cf Reply, \u00b6 366.\n\nReply, \u00b6 366; *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008), **Exhibit CLA-16, \u00b6** 455.\n\n263.\n\nClaimant also refers to Prof. Schrijver\u2019s opinion that *\"[particularly when the expropriation is alleged to have resulted from a broad series of acts, none of which* [is] *necessarily illegal under domestic law per se, the correct approach can only be to examine how each of those acts is* \u2018properly\u2019 *and* \u2018fairly\u2019 *to be characterized when viewed against the broader chronology of events, in the general pattern, of which it forms part.\"277* In reliance on Prof. Schrijver, Claimant asserts that Article 4(1) of the Treaty is *\"broad in scope.\"278*\n\nReply, \u00b6 368; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 120; Schrijver, \u00b6 13.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 123; Schrijver, \u2018 53.\n\n264.\n\nClaimant submits that the Tribunal must examine each of Respondent\u2019s acts in light of the circumstances surrounding, *inter alia,* the decision to invest and the process culminating in the termination of the Concession Contract. According to Claimant, *\"the critical question for the Tribunal is whether the totality of the Respondent\u2019s actions in their cumulative effect constitutes an expropriation\"279*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 118, 120.\n\n265.\n\nClaimant is further of the view that the effect of Respondent\u2019s measures on the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations must also be taken into account.280\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 491-\n\n266.\n\nClaimant states that the scope of Article 4(1) of the Treaty extends to the protection of intangible rights, which include shares and equity interests, as well as contractual rights. In this regard, Claimant relies on the case of *Roslnvest v. Russia* to support its argument that Vigotop may claim protection *\"for the effect on its shares by measures of the host state\"* taken against the Project Companies.281\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 492; *RoslnvestCo \u00b6\u00b6 Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. V079/2005, Final Award (12 September 2010), **Exhibit CLA-10, \u00b6** 608.\n\n267.\n\nFinally, Claimant is of the view that the termination of a concession contract for invalid reasons constitutes a form of expropriation of a claimant\u2019s rights under such a contract, even when, as is the case here, it is the investor\u2019s subsidiary who is the party to the contract.282\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 492.\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nRespondent submits that there is no dispute as to the general description of the requirements of a lawful expropriation under Article 4(1) of the Treaty. Respondent further does not contest Claimant\u2019s submission that an expropriation may be direct or indirect (including creeping) in nature.283\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 336.\n\n269.\n\nRespondent refers to the case of *Tecmed v. Mexico* in which the tribunal held that a direct expropriation involves *\"a forcible taking by the Government of tangible or intangible property owned by the private person by means of administrative or legislative action to that effect.* \"284 Respondent submits that, by contrast, an indirect expropriation results from *\"the incremental encroachment on one or more* of '[the investor\u2019s] *ownership rights [...] that eventually destroys (or nearly destroys) the value of his or her investment.\"285*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 337; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Ukraine* in which the tribunal stated that creeping expropriation *\"is a form of indirect expropriation with a distinctive temporal quality in the sense that it encapsulates the situation whereby a series of acts attributable to the State over a period of time culminate in the expropriatory taking of such property.\"286*\n\n*Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award (16 September 2003), **Exhibit RLA-13, \u00b6** 20.22.\n\n271.\n\nRespondent submits that a finding of expropriation requires State interference of a certain magnitude or severity. It cites the case of *Pope & Talbot v. Canada,* in which the tribunal held that *\"under international law, expropriation requires a* \u2018substantial deprivation\u2019.\"287\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Canada,* Ad hoc - IIC 192, Award (26 June 2000), **Exhibit RLA-7,\u00b6** 102.\n\n272.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant has conceded that Respondent\u2019s conduct prior to the termination of the Concession Contract did not interfere with Claimant\u2019s investment to such an extent as to constitute *\"substantial deprivation\"* and that the termination of the Concession Contract is therefore the *\"crux\"* of Claimant\u2019s claim.288\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 338.\n\n273.\n\nRespondent considers that Claimant appears to advance two expropriation claims: (i) that the termination *\"in and of itself* [was] *an expropriatory act,\"* and (ii) that the termination was *\"the last step\"* in a series of measures that together constituted a creeping expropriation. Respondent refers to the case of *Enron v. Argentina* in which the tribunal held that *\"if a given measure qualifies as a form of direct expropriation it cannot at the same time qualify as an indirect expropriation, as their nature and extent are different.\"289* In Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant\u2019s two claims are therefore necessarily alternative claims.290\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 339; *Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets, UP. v.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, which deals with protection against expropriation, may be quoted here again for ease of reference:\n\n\"1. *Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, investors of the other Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:*\n\n*(a) The measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;*\n\n*(b) the measures are not discriminatory;*\n\n*(c) the measures are accompanied by provision for the payment of just compensation.\"*\n\n275.\n\nThe criteria for the legality of expropriation set out in Article 4(1) of the Treaty are largely consistent with customary international law. The Tribunal notes however that, in the present case, the Parties are primarily in dispute as to whether an expropriation occurred as a matter of fact. As Article 4 does not define when an expropriation has taken place as a matter of fact, this must be determined in light of the evidence.\n\n276.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties as to the legal concept of deprivation or expropriation, including that expropriation may take place indirectly. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant\u2019s legal expert Prof. Schrijver that the language used in Article 4(1) of the Treaty is *\"broad in scope.\"291* Indeed, Article 4(1) of the Treaty expressly provides for a protection standard covering measures that *\"directly or indirectly\"* deprive investors of their investments. Furthermore, it is common ground between the Parties that indirect expropriation may take place in a *\"creeping\u2019* manner.\n\nSchrijver, \u00b6 53.\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant advances claims for both direct and indirect expropriation. In its Reply, Claimant distinguishes between its claims (i) that Respondent directly expropriated Claimant\u2019s investment by terminating the Concession Contract, and (ii) that in any event, the cumulative effect of Respondent\u2019s culpable acts and omissions culminating in the termination was an indirect and creeping expropriation.292 In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant focuses on its claim for indirect expropriation, which is based on the *\"totality of Respondent\u2019s actions in their cumulative effect,\"* without further elaborating on its claim for direct expropriation.293\n\nSection IV. E and F of the Reply.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 120. In fact, the term *\"direct expropriation\"* is used only once throughout the whole document, namely, where Claimant notes that *\"Respondent makes the deceptive submission that the concept of expropriation is somehow limited and extends only to the simplest form of*  *direct expropriation* *.\"* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 122 (emphasis added).\n\n278.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimant has not established that Respondent's actions and omissions prior to the termination of the Concession Contract, in and of themselves, had an expropriatory effect on Claimant\u2019s investment. This includes the revocation of Special Project Status for the Sukoro Site because the Tribunal is not convinced that this revocation would have prevented Claimant from realizing the Project, be it at Sukoro or at any of the 132 alternative sites contemplated under the Concession Contract, as will be discussed in more detail below. In any event, Claimant has not claimed that the revocation of Special Project Status in itself amounts to an expropriation. Consequently, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent\u2019s pre-termination actions and omissions do not amount to an indirect or creeping expropriation, as alleged by Claimant.\n\n279.\n\nBy contrast, there is no doubt that the termination of the Concession Contract resulted in a substantial devaluation of Claimant\u2019s shareholdings in KC Bidding by depriving KC Bidding of its main asset, *i.e.,* its rights under the Concession Contract. It is further undisputed between the Parties that Article 4 of the Treaty protects Claimant against measures directed not only at Claimant\u2019s shareholdings in their own right, but also at Claimant\u2019s indirect interest in KC Bidding\u2019s rights under the Concession Contract. A substantial devaluation of Claimant\u2019s shareholdings could thus constitute a taking of Claimant\u2019s investment within the meaning of Article 4 of the Treaty.\n\n280.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will focus on the question whether, as a matter of fact, the termination of the Concession Contract constituted an expropriatory act within the meaning of Article 4 of the Cyprus-Hungary BIT. In order to establish that the termination of the Concession Contract was of an expropriatory nature, Claimant must show in particular that the termination was a sovereign act rather than the act of an ordinary contracting party. In view of the fact that Claimant describes the termination of the Concession Contract as the *\"culminating\u2019* point of Respondent\u2019s various, allegedly unlawful, pre-termination actions and omissions, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis will also take into account Respondent\u2019s pre-termination conduct.\n\n**C. Relevance of Other Standards of Protection in the Cyprus-Hungary BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nBefore turning to its analysis, the Tribunal will first address the disputed issue whether other standards of protection in the Cyprus-Hungary BIT, in particular the fair and equitable treatment standard (the **\"FET standard\")** contained in Article 3, may be relevant to the finding of an expropriation.\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nClaimant submits that the non-expropriation standards of protection under the Treaty are relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the scope of Respondent\u2019s obligations under Article 4 of the Treaty and, in particular, to the assessment whether Respondent neutralized Claimant\u2019s investment by way of expropriatory conduct. In Claimant\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s conduct constitutes multiple violations of such standards and is of central relevance for distinguishing an expropriation from *bona fide* regulation.294\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19; *cf.* Reply, \u00b6 371.\n\n283.\n\nClaimant argues that non-expropriation standards of protection under the Treaty are relevant not only to the assessment of the legality of an expropriation, but also to the assessment whether an expropriation has taken place.295 Claimant submits that the decisions in *Telenor v. Hungary296* and *Nations Energy Inc. v. Panama,297* relied upon by Respondent in support of its argument that other Treaty standards are not relevant, are inapplicable to the facts of this case. Vigotop states that the claimants in both of those cases raised two separate claims, one for expropriation and one for breach of the FET standard, and the tribunals refused to examine the self-standing claims for breach of FET as they fell outside their jurisdiction.298 In this case however, Claimant does not raise a separate claim for relief for breach of the FET standard.299\n\nReply, \u00b6 371.\n\n*Telenor Mobile Communications AS v.

Hungary,* in which the claimants similarly limited their claim for relief to the allegation that Hungary had expropriated their investments. The tribunal ruled that there was an expropriation and expressly referred to Hungary\u2019s breach of other investment protection standards contained in the Treaty.300\n\nReply, \u00b6 374; *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award (2 October 2006), **Exhibit CLA-5,** 445, 379.\n\n285.\n\nClaimant also refers to the case of *Roslnvest v. Russia,* in which the tribunal, despite its jurisdiction being limited to expropriation, observed that it was doubtful whether Russia\u2019s actions could be seen as affording fair and equitable treatment.301\n\nReply, \u00b6 377; *RoslnvestCo \u00b6\u00b6 Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. V079/2005, Final Award (12 September 2010), **Exhibit CLA-10.1)** 557.\n\n286.\n\nClaimant further relies on Prof. Schrijver\u2019s legal opinion, in which he states:\n\n\" [I]t *cannot be denied that the same conduct will often be capable of giving rise to breaches of different standards of protection. The potential for overlap exists in particular between the fair and equitable treatment standard and the protection against indirect expropriations.\"302*\n\nReply, \u00b6 375; Schrijver, \u00b6 32.\n\n287.\n\nClaimant asserts that Respondent does not challenge Claimant\u2019s submission that many of the elements relevant to the finding of a breach of the FET standard can materially inform the inquiry into whether there was an indirect expropriation. For example, Respondent does not contest the relevance of investors\u2019 legitimate expectations to both the expropriation and the FET standard.303\n\nReply, \u00b6 378.\n\n288.\n\nClaimant acknowledges that each of the Treaty standards protects against a different kind of interference by a State. Nevertheless, Claimant is of the view that even the authorities relied upon by Respondent do not undermine the argument that the same conduct will often be capable of giving rise to breaches of different standards of protection.304\n\nReply, \u00b6 379; Claimant refers to Prof. Brigitte Stem, *\"The Impact of Investment Treaty Arbitration: Comments on Present Expectations and Realities'\"* in ICCA Congress Series No. 14, 2008, p. 86. **Exhibit RLA-45.**\n\n289.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s reliance on the case of *FFIC v. Mexico,* in which the tribunal found that a clear case of discriminatory treatment did not give rise to an expropriation claim, Claimant contends that the tribunal\u2019s reasoning in that case would suggest the existence of a sliding scale, such that severely discriminatory treatment will rise to the level of an expropriation. Claimant alleges that the tribunal\u2019s recognition in that case that discriminatory treatment is used *\"as one of the factors to distinguish between a compensable expropriation and a non-compensable regulation by a host State\"305* confirms the relevance of the standard to the existence of an expropriatory act and thereby confirms Claimant\u2019s submission that the FET standard is relevant to the present case.306\n\n*Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/l, Award (17 July 2006), **Exhibit RLA-19, \u00b6** 206.\n\nReply, \u00b6 380.\n\n290.\n\nClaimant also refers to the case of *Quasar de Valores v. Russia,* in which the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction was limited to the question whether the respondent had expropriated the claimant\u2019s investment without compensation and whether that expropriation was lawful. In that case, the tribunal noted that, while the unlawfulness of an expropriation is not the same thing as the existence of an expropriation, there is a strong overlap between the elements relevant to both analyses.307\n\nReply, \u00b6 382; *Quasar de Valores SICA V S.A. and Others v. The Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. 24/2007, Award (20 July 2012), **Exhibit CLA-11, \u00b6** 45.\n\n291.\n\nClaimant refers to Prof. Schrijver\u2019s statement:\n\n*\"The practice of using the fair and equitable treatment standard as a yardstick to considering whether host State conduct transcended the threshold of an indirect expropriation has been adopted by investment tribunals, whose jurisdiction was otherwise confined to claims concerning expropriation. \"308*\n\nReply, \u00b6 384; Schrijver, \u00b6 35.\n\n292.\n\nClaimant also relies on the case of *Biwater Gauff v.

United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008), **Exhibit CLA-16, \u00b6** 708.\n\n293.\n\nClaimant concludes that if conduct constituting a violation of the FET standard can *\"convert\"* a lawful act into an expropriatory one, it must be relevant for the present Tribunal to consider Respondent\u2019s actions in light of the FET and other Treaty standards.310\n\nReply, \u00b6 386.\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nRespondent submits that, in assessing Claimant\u2019s expropriation claims under Article 4 of the Treaty, the Tribunal need not consider - or decide - Claimant\u2019s claims concerning alleged violations of Article 3 of the Treaty, on the basis that Articles 3 and 4 provide for separate and independent Treaty standards and should be treated as such.311\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 317.\n\n295.\n\nRespondent refers to the case of *FFIC v. Mexico,* in which the jurisdiction of the tribunal was limited to claims concerning expropriation and compensation. In that case, the tribunal rejected the argument that it is significant in expropriation cases whether the government\u2019s acts and omissions are unfair and inequitable, and held that the claimant\u2019s argument *\"would conflate an* [expropriation] *claim with a* [FET] *claim, which is* *clearly inconsistent with the exclusion of* [FET] *claims from investor-State arbitration*.\"312\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 319; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 23; *Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/l, Award (17 July 2006), **Exhibit RLA-19, \u00b6** 208.\n\n296.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that it does not suggest that considerations of due process and non-discrimination are not at all relevant in the context of Article 4 of the Treaty, but rather that such considerations concern the legality of an expropriation and do not relate to the existence of an expropriatory measure.313 Respondent claims that only once the existence of an expropriation has been established can the question of its legality under the terms of the Treaty, including considerations of due process and nondiscrimination, arise.314\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 322 (emphasis in original); *cf.* Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 22.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 322.\n\n297.\n\nAs regards the case of *FFIC v. Mexico,* Respondent also highlights the tribunal\u2019s reasoning that *\"one cannot start an inquiry into whether expropriation has occurred by examining whether the conditions [...]for avoiding liability in the event of an expropriation have been fulfilled\"315*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 323; *Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/02/l, Award (17 July 2006), **Exhibit RLA-19, \u00b6** 174.\n\n298.\n\nRespondent further refers to the case of *Corn Products International, Inc. v. Mexico* in which the tribunal held:\n\n*\"It is not the case that, because a measure which affects property rights is discriminatory, it is therefore an expropriation [...] Rather, if a measure is established to be an expropriation [...], it cannot then be justified if it is discriminatory.\"316*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 325; *Corn Products International Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/l, Decision on Liability (18 August 2009), **Exhibit RLA-25, \u00b6** 90.\n\n299.\n\nIn response to Claimant\u2019s reference to the case of *ADC v. Hungary,* Respondent asserts that Claimant confuses the distinction between the existence of expropriatory measures and their legality. Respondent submits that the claimants in that case asserted breaches of Article 3 of the Treaty in the context of a violation of Article 4(1)(a) of the Treaty, which stipulates that due process is a condition for the legality of an expropriation. Respondent submits that the tribunal initially determined that there was an expropriation and even examined its legality without making any reference to Article 3 of the Treaty. It was not until its ultimate conclusion on the merits that the tribunal noted that the expropriation was unlawful because *\"it did not comply with due process, in particular,* *the Claimants were denied of' fair* and equitable treatment\u2019 *specified in Article 3(1) of the BIT and the Respondent failed to provide* \u2018full security and protection\u2019 *to the Claimants\u2019 investments under Article 3(2) of the BIT.\"317* In Respondent\u2019s view, the tribunal in that case exceeded its jurisdiction in determining liability under Article 3 of the Treaty even if its determination ultimately related only to the illegality of the expropriation.318\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 327-328; *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

Respondent submits that considerations of due process and non-discrimination in the context of an expropriation claim are part of the assessment whether an expropriation is lawful under Article 4(l)(a)-(c) and can be resolved without reference to Article 3.319\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 330.\n\n301.\n\nRespondent disagrees with Claimant\u2019s reliance on the case of *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* in its submission that *\"[v]iolations of other standards of investment protection [... ] may contribute to a finding of unlawful expropriation.\"320* Respondent argues that the award merely illustrates that one aspect of State conduct may give rise to several investment treaty violations; it does not support Claimant\u2019s contention that one treaty violation may contribute to another treaty violation.321\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 331 referring to Memorial, \u00b6 376.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 332.\n\n302.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s view that *\"Claimant\u2019s extensive reliance on non-expropriation Treaty standards betrays the absence of any expropriatory conduct in this case\"322* Respondent submits that Claimant *\"attempts to salvage its* ultra vires *nonexpropriation claims\"* by emphasizing that it does not raise a separate claim for Hungary\u2019s alleged failure to accord fair and equitable treatment. Respondent refers to the case of *Emmis International v. Hungary* in which the tribunal held that an investor cannot justify the submission of claims that exceed the State\u2019s consent to arbitration simply by refraining from requesting separate relief.323 According to Respondent, Claimant\u2019s reliance on non-expropriation standards should therefore be rejected even if it is not accompanied by a separate request for relief.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 24; *Emmis International Holding, B.V, Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., and MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. v.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls at the outset that, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Treaty, its jurisdiction is limited to disputes *\"concerning expropriation of an investment\"* While the Treaty provides for other standards of protection, in particular the FET standard, any dispute concerning such other standards does not fall within the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n304.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal will first examine whether an expropriation has taken place as a matter of fact. If this is not the case, the Tribunal will not have to address the second question whether the expropriation was lawful.\n\n305.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the cases cited by the Parties, in which the tribunals\u2019 jurisdiction was limited to expropriation claims as is the case here, give no clear guidance as to whether non-expropriation standards may be applied in determining whether there was an expropriation. In particular, the case law suggests that non-expropriation standards have been considered primarily in determining the legality of an established expropriation, namely in the context of assessing compliance with the requirements of due process of law and non-discrimination, such as those articulated in Article 4(l)(a) and (b) of the Treaty.\n\n306.\n\nIn the case of *ADC v. Hungary,324* which was relied upon by Claimant, the relevance of other treaty standards was discussed only in the context of due process, *i.e.,* in relation to the assessment whether the expropriation was lawful. Consequently, the tribunal\u2019s decision in that case gives no guidance as to whether non-expropriation treaty standards can be used to determine whether an expropriation has occurred.\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award (2 October 2006), **Exhibit CLA-5.**\n\n307.\n\nClaimant further relies on the case of *Roslnvest v. Russia,* in which the tribunal, despite its jurisdiction being limited to expropriation,325 concluded that *\"there remain doubts* *whether* [the distinctions made between the claimant and its competitors] *can be seen as a fair and equitable treatment.\"326* However, the tribunal did not give any precise reasons as to why it was appropriate to consider fair and equitable treatment in analyzing the expropriation claim, and ultimately concluded that it did not have to decide whether its doubts were justified.327 Consequently, this case also does not give clear guidance as to whether the FET standard as such may be relied upon in the finding of an expropriation.\n\nThe arbitration clause in the UK-Soviet BIT originally limited the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in that case even further than in the present case, since it did not even extend to the question whether an expropriation had occurred, but rather limited the jurisdiction to the consequences of an expropriation, such as compensation. However, the tribunal held in its previous award on jurisdiction that the claimant could invoke the most-favored-nation clause contained in the UK-Soviet BIT to incorporate the broader arbitration clause contained in the Denmark-Russia BIT. As a consequence, the tribunal held that *\"it has jurisdiction extending beyond that granted by Article 8 of the UK-Soviet BIT and covering the issues whether Respondent\u2019s actions have to be considered as expropriations and were valid.\" RoslnvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,*SCC Case No. V079/2005, Award on Jurisdiction (October 2007), \u00b6 139.\n\n*RoslnvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. V079/2005, Final Award (12 September 2010), **Exhibit CLA-10, \u00b6** 557.\n\nThe tribunal held that it was not required to decide whether any particular measure would be sufficient, in itself, to amount to an expropriation because it found that the cumulative effect of the respondent\u2019s conduct did amount to expropriation.\n\n308.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that Respondent relies upon the case of *FFIC v. Mexico* in support of its argument that the Tribunal may not resort to other Treaty standards. In that case, the tribunal clearly stated that the claimant could not rely on the FET standard in support of its expropriation claim because this would *\"conflate\"* an FET claim with an expropriation claim, which in turn would not be consistent with the exclusion of FET claims from investor-State arbitration under Chapter Fourteen of the NAFTA.328 With regard to the relevance of discriminatory treatment on the other hand, the tribunal stated that such treatment not only was relevant to the question whether an expropriation was lawful, but also constituted one of the factors distinguishing expropriation from *bona fide* regulation by the host-State.329 The tribunal reached the conclusion that the respondent\u2019s conduct was a clear case of discriminatory treatment of a foreign investor, but held that this conduct did not give rise to an expropriation claim because it did not involve a taking of the investment.330\n\n*Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v.

To the contrary, the tribunal clearly held that the claimant could not rely upon a breach of the FET standard as such to prove its expropriation claim. The Tribunal is therefore of the view that *FFIC v. Mexico* tends rather to support Respondent\u2019s position that other Treaty standards in general, and the FET standard in particular, may not be applied in determining whether there was an expropriation.\n\n310.\n\nIn the absence of clear precedents relevant to the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that it cannot decide whether an expropriation has occurred by determining whether other Treaty standards have been violated. In particular, the violation of the FET standard, for example, is neither a necessary nor sufficient basis for finding an expropriation. Thus, the Tribunal will not resort to other Treaty standards in determining whether an expropriation has occurred. This being said, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed that the principle of good faith is a fundamental principle of international law,331 consideration of which is not restricted to the context of FET claims. Even though, as Respondent correctly points out, the good faith principle is not in itself a source of obligations, it may inform the analysis whether Respondent\u2019s conduct amounted to an expropriation.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 29; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 27. *Cf.* Anthony D\u2019Amato, *\"Good Faith\"* in Encyclopedia of Public International Law, 1992, p. 600: *\"The principle of good faith is rooted in a natural law conception of customary international law. [...] The principle of good faith thus owes its present authoritative status to the natural law foundations of general international law, to customary international law as derived from the articulation of that custom in numerous treaties [...].\"*\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the same conduct may violate, or be relevant in determining violations of, different provisions of a BIT, as Claimant argues. But the mere fact that other standards may be violated by the same conduct does not necessarily mean that the conduct constitutes an expropriation. Whether the FET standard, for example, is violated and whether an expropriation has occurred require separate legal analyses, independently conducted, even though they may involve the same factual conduct.\n\n**D. The Tribunal\u2019s Approach to the Question of Expropriation**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the analysis whether certain conduct constitutes an expropriatory act cannot be carried out in an abstract manner, but rather must be based on the specific facts of the case. It has to be noted that the Concession Contract was not terminated by way of legislative act or executive decree, but rather by Respondent\u2019s exercise of negotiated contractual termination rights, on the grounds that Claimant allegedly failed to comply with its contractual obligations. In the Termination Letter, Respondent did not purport to invoke any of its sovereign prerogatives. On its face, Respondent\u2019s termination notice would therefore appear to be the act of an ordinary contracting party rather than the act of a sovereign State.\n\n313.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the fact that Respondent purported to exercise a contractual right when terminating the Concession Contract does not exclude *per se* the possibility that this conduct at the same time amounted to an expropriation.332 In the given circumstances, it is clear that the Tribunal must consider the way in which the Concession Contract was concluded, performed and terminated to determine the expropriation claim.333 At the same time, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that, by taking such contractual matters into consideration, it will not determine contractual claims or exercise jurisdiction under the Concession Contract;334 any findings that this Tribunal may make in respect of the Concession Contract are relevant only as a part of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim.335\n\nThe tribunal in *Bayindir v. Pakistan* similarly stated that *\"the fact that a State exercises a contract right or remedy does not in and of itself exclude the possibility of a treaty breach.\"* *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A. S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award (27 August 2009), **Exhibit RLA-26**, \u00b6 138. **Cf.** the findings of the *ad hoc* committee and the subsequently reconstituted tribunal in the case of *Vivendi v. Argentina. Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (22 April 2005), **Exhibit RLA-17**, \u00b6 258.\n\nThe same approach was taken by the tribunal in *Bayindir v. Pakistan. Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A. S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,*ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award (27 August 2009), **Exhibit RLA-26**, \u00b6\u00b6 135-138.\n\nAs the tribunal in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* stated; *\"A [...] distinction can be drawn between actually* \u2018deciding\u2019 *issues relating to the conclusion, performance and termination of a contract which is beyond the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and* \u2018taking into consideration\u2019 *the facts surrounding the conclusion, performance and termination of this contract in order to decide the treaty claims submitted to the Arbitral Tribunal.\"* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008), **Exhibit CLA-16,** \u00b6 472.\n\n*Cf* **Exhibit CLA-16**, \u00b6 **471.**\n\n314.\n\nWhile the Parties do not dispute that the Tribunal in its expropriation analysis may take into account the circumstances in which the Concession Contract was entered into, performed and terminated, they do not agree on the subsequent question, which is whether there can be a finding of expropriation in the event that Respondent, as it alleges, in fact terminated the Concession Contract in accordance with its express terms and Hungarian law.\n\n315.\n\nPrimarily, it is Claimant\u2019s case that Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract did not accord with its terms and was unlawful as a matter of Hungarian law.336 Claimant further contends, however, that, even assuming that the termination of the Concession Contract was in accordance both with its terms and with Hungarian law, this would not be dispositive of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of whether the termination amounted to an expropriation.337 According to Claimant, the purported contractual termination grounds were only a pretext and, in fact, Respondent terminated the Concession Contract for public policy reasons, thus acting in its sovereign capacity, despite the formal appearance of the Termination Letter.338 Moreover, Claimant contends that the termination was a disproportionate response to the purported contractual breaches and a *\"malicious exercise of a right, a fictitious exercise of a right and an abuse of rights\"339*\n\nReply, \u00b6 423.\n\nReply, \u00b6 441.\n\n*Cf.* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 144-150, 278.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 199.\n\n316.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent submits that it terminated the Concession Contract in accordance with its terms and Hungarian law and asserts that a lawful termination cannot constitute an expropriation of contractual rights.340 Respondent is of the view that, even though the legality of the termination under Hungarian law is not dispositive of Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim, a State which is exercising its contractual right to terminate a contract in accordance with its terms and governing law, without invoking its sovereign powers, is *\"by definition conducting itself as an* \u2018ordinary contracting party\u2019.\"341 Respondent further contends that even a wrongful termination of a contract concluded by a State is not expropriatory in nature *\"unlessprocured by sovereign conduct\"342*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 358.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 273.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 408.\n\n317.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties rely upon various precedents in support of their respective positions with regard to the question whether a contract termination, which was in accordance with its terms and its governing law, excludes the finding of an expropriation. The Tribunal has reviewed those decisions and notes that there is common ground insofar as all of the tribunals considered sovereign or governmental conduct on the part of the State to be a necessary requirement for a finding of an expropriation. In the words of the tribunal *in Impregiio v. Pakistan,* the State\u2019s alleged conduct *\"must be the result of behavior going beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt. Only the State in the exercise of its sovereign authority* ('puissance publique\u2019) *and not as a contracting party, may breach the obligations assumed under the BIT.\"343*\n\n*Impregilo S.pA. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (22 April 2005), **Exhibit RLA-17**, \u00b6 260. In the case of *Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela,* the tribunal considered it *\"necessary that the conduct of the State should go beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt.\" Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,*ICSID Case No. ARB/11/22, Award (16 January 2013), ***Exhibit RLA-70**,* \u00b6 209. The tribunal in*Siemens v. Argentina* similarly stated that *\"such behavior must be beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt and involve State interference with the operation of the contract.\"* *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Award (6 February 2007), **Exhibit CLA-15**, \u00b6 248. In the case of *Bayindir v. Pakistan,* the tribunal examined *\"whether the alleged interference with the property or the rights of the investor has been made in the State's exercise of its sovereign powers.\"**Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award (27 August 2009), **Exhibit RLA-26**, \u00b6 444. The tribunal in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* noted that *\"the critical distinction is between situations in which a State acts merely as a contractual partner, and cases in which it acts* \u2018iure imperi\u2019, *exercising elements of its governmental authority.\"* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008), **Exhibit CLA-16**, \u00b6 458.\n\n318.\n\nClaimant\u2019s legal expert Prof. Schrijver referred to this common approach in investment treaty case law as the *\"Stepping Out of the Contractual Shoes-Test.\"344*\n\nSchrijver, \u00b6 23.\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that most345 of the tribunals considered the question whether the State\u2019s termination of the relevant contract was in accordance with its terms and its governing law to be relevant for their analysis of the expropriation claim. In the case of *Malicorp v. Egypt,* the tribunal was of the view that, if the State\n\n*\"had the right to discharge itself from the Contract pursuant to the private law rules governing it, [...] it is unnecessary to examine whether the* [State] *also took a measure under its public powers* (\u2018measures de puissance publique'), *not as a party to the Contract but as a State. \"346*\n\nIt appears that the case of *Parkerings-Compagniet v. Lithuania* is the only precedent in which the tribunal considered that, as there was no evidence that the State had used its sovereign power in terminating the relevant agreement, it was *\"unnecessary and irrelevant to ascertain whether the termination breached the Agreement.\"* *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award (11 September 2007), **Exhibit RLA-23**, \u00b6\u00b6 445-446. The tribunal in *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania,* even though it also considered that it was not its role to decide contractual issues, such as whether the relevant contract was rightly or wrongfully terminated, stated at the same time that *\"in determining the treaty claims [...], it is impossible to disregard the way in which the Lease Contract was concluded, performed, renegotiated and terminated.\"* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008), **Exhibit CLA-16, \u00b6\u00b6** 469-470. In the case of *Suez v. Argentina,* the tribunal similarly held that the question whether the alleged exercise of contractual rights was in accordance with the contract was a matter for the contractual dispute settlement process, but stated at the same time that, *\"under certain circumstances, the unlawful exercise of a contractual remedy may support the conclusion that there has been a treaty breach\"* and noted that it had taken into account the contractual conduct of the State and concluded that the measures taken to terminate the contract *\"were ostensibly an exercise of its contractual rights but not measures of expropriation.\"* *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrales de Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Liability (30 July 2010), **Exhibit RLA-28**, \u00b6\u00b6 144-145.\n\n*Malicorp Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award (7 February 2011), **Exhibit RLA-31**, \u00b6 126. The tribunal in *Impregilo* v. *Argentina* similarly stated that *\"if the Contract is terminated in conformity with these provisions, this is not an act of expropriation by the State but an act performed by the public authorities in their capacity as a party to the Contract.\" Impregilo\u00a0S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic,*ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award (21 June 2011), **Exhibit RLA-32**, \u00b6 272.\n\n320.\n\nWith regard to the claimant\u2019s allegation in that case that the contractual grounds were mere pretexts and that a change of government policy was the real reason for terminating the contract, the tribunal took this possibility into account and further stated:\n\n*\"A contracting party cannot be prohibited from discharging itself from a contract where it has legitimate reasons for doing so, even if,* *indirectly, the measure suits its convenience and enables it to go back on choices made earlier. Put another way, the first question to ask is whether the reasons given by the Respondent in its letter of termination justify the termination.\"347*\n\n**Exhibit RLA-31, \u00b6** 129 (emphasis added).\n\n321.\n\nThe tribunal went on to find that that the principal contractual reason given by the State was *\"sufficiently well founded\u2019;* it further considered the criticisms of the claimant\u2019s contractual performance raised in the letter of rescission to be *\"sufficiently plausible\"* and concluded that the contractual reasons on which the State had relied *\"appear serious and adequate \"348*\n\n**Exhibit RLA-31**, \u00b6\u00b6 137, 142, 143. By contrast, the tribunal in *Biwater Gauff* v. *Tanzania,* which found that the respondent had indeed exercised its sovereign authority, concluded that the respondent\u2019s conduct was *\"unreasonable and unjustified.\"* *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited* v. *United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008), **Exhibit CLA-16**, \u00b6 502.\n\n322.\n\nThe *ad hoc* annulment committee in *Vivendi* v. *Argentina* took the position that the legality of the State\u2019s conduct under national law does not exclude the finding of an expropriation, but nevertheless considered it to be part of the expropriation analysis. The committee noted that \"[a] *State may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and vice versa.\"349* At the same time, the committee noted that *\"municipal law will often be relevant in assessing whether there has been a breach of the treaty\"* and argued in favor of \"tak[ing] *into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law.\"350*\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment (3 July 2002), **Exhibit CLA-106**, \u00b6 95. This finding was confirmed by the subsequently reconstituted tribunal: \"A *state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract; it may also breach a treaty at the same time it breaches a contract.\"* **Exhibit CLA-88**, \u00b6 7.3.10. In the *ELSI*\u00a0case, the chamber of the International Court of Justice similarly stated: \" *What is a breach of treaty may be lawful in the municipal law and what is unlawful in the municipal law may be wholly innocent of violation of a treaty provision.\" Elettronica Sicula\u00a0S.pA.

The tribunal in *Tecmed* v. *Mexico* also held: *\"That the actions of the Respondent are legitimate or lawful or in compliance with the law from the standpoint of the Respondent\u2019s domestic laws does not mean that they conform to the Agreement or to international law.\" T\u00e9cnicas\u00a0Medioambientales Tecmed, SA. v.

The reconstituted tribunal later stated that it would *\"consider* [the] *alleged contractual breaches,\"* but also noted that it did *\"not consider it necessary to come to a definitive view as to whether either party has or has not breached the Concession Agreement.\"* **Exhibit CLA-88**, \u00b6\u00b6 7.3.10-7.3.11. In the *ELSI* case, the chamber also considered that, while it does not follow from a finding by a municipal court that an act was unjustified or arbitrary, that the act is also to be qualified as arbitrary in international law, such qualification by the court *\"may be a valuable indication.\" Elettronica\u00a0Sicula S.pA.

Venezuela,* the tribunal did not expressly distinguish between the analysis of national and international law, but simply stated that the claimant had violated the contract, which rendered the termination *\"both justified and legitimate,\"* without giving an explanation as to the exact meaning of those terms.351 The tribunal further observed that the contractual breaches concerned *\"material factors\"* in the initial selection of the claimant as the investor and held that the respondent\u2019s actions had been *\"legitimate contractual responses to what the Tribunal considers to be contractual breaches\"352*\n\n*Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v.

Pakistan* first noted that *\"a breach of contract is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a breach of treaty,\"* but later held that *\"if the* [termination] *was lawful under the Contract, then there would be no taking of or interference with Bayindir\u2019s rights.\"353*\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award (27 August 2009), **Exhibit RLA-26,** \u00b6\u00b6 139, 458.\n\n325.\n\nAccording to Claimant\u2019s legal expert Prof. Schrijver, it is well established that *\"the question whether a measure amounts to a violation of a State\u2019s international obligation is one arising irrespective of the position under domestic law.\"354* Prof. Schrijver refers to Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and Article 3 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, which provides:\n\n*\"The characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.\"*\n\nSchrijver, \u00b6 10.\n\n326.\n\nAt the same time, Prof. Schrijver argues that *\"a breach of the contract has [... ] evidentiary value for the purpose of establishing a breach of the treaty\"* and *\"may well be taken into account\"* in the analysis of the expropriation claim.355\n\nSchrijver, \u00b6 20\n\n327.\n\nHaving considered the relevant case law cited by the Parties and also taking into account Prof. Schrijver\u2019s opinion, the Tribunal is of the view that the question whether Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract was in accordance with both its terms and Hungarian law is not dispositive of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis whether an expropriation occurred. The Tribunal rather agrees with the majority of the precedents and Prof. Schrijver that, even though a finding that the termination violated the terms of the Concession Contract or provisions of Hungarian law may be relevant to its expropriation analysis, such a finding is neither necessary nor sufficient to conclude that Article 4 of the Treaty was violated. In fact, the Tribunal notes that, even though some tribunals appear to have taken a different view on this issue, they nevertheless did not limit their analysis to purely contractual considerations. Rather, they included alleged non-contractual motives for terminating the contract in their discussion on whether it was *\"legitimate\"* or *\"reasonable\"* to terminate the contract in the respective circumstances.356\n\n*See* references in paragraph 323 and note 348.\n\n328.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore begin its analysis by focusing on the key question: whether - to put it in the words of Prof. Schrijver - Respondent *\"stepped out of the contractual shoes\"357* and, in fact, acted in its sovereign capacity when it terminated the Concession Contract. Accordingly, the Tribunal will first examine whether, as alleged by Claimant, Respondent had *\"a hidden political agenda,\"* which was the true reason for its termination of the Concession Contract, meaning that Respondent in fact took this decision in order to give effect to a change in government policy, and thus in its sovereign capacity. If this were not the case, this would exclude the finding of an expropriation regardless of whether Respondent acted in accordance with the terms of the Concession Contract and Hungarian law.358 However, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that Respondent indeed had public policy reasons to terminate the Concession Contract, this would not necessarily in itself lead to a finding that the termination amounted to an expropriation because Respondent could at the same time have had contractual grounds for terminating the Concession Contract.\n\nSchrijver, \u00b6 23.\n\nAs stated by the tribunal in *Suez v. Argentina,* if the State did not act in the exercise of its sovereign powers, but as an ordinary contracting party, *\"no expropriation has taken place and the Claimants have only contractual claims under the legal framework\"* by which the contract is governed. *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrales de Agua SA. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Liability (30 July 2010), **Exhibit RLA-28**, \u00b6 143.\n\n329.\n\nIn the latter case, the Tribunal would therefore have to continue its analysis by examining, as a second step, whether contractual grounds for terminating the Concession Contract in fact existed. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, a finding that none of the contractual grounds invoked by Respondent were sufficiently well-founded, while not being dispositive of the expropriation question in itself, could indicate that they were merely a pretext designed to conceal a purely expropriatory measure. If, on the other hand, the Tribunal were to reach the contrary conclusion, *i.e.,* that Respondent had contractual termination grounds in addition to its public policy reasons, this would require a further analysis.\n\n330.\n\nIn the event of such a parallel cause (public policy reasons and contractual grounds), the Tribunal would thus have to examine, as a third and final step, whether the contractual termination was legitimate, *i.e.,* consistent with the good faith principle. To be specific, the Tribunal would have to determine whether the termination constituted an abuse of the contractual right in order to avoid liability to compensate, that is, whether it involved a *\"fictitious\"* or *\"malicious\"* exercise of the right to terminate.\n\n331.\n\nIf the Tribunal were ultimately to conclude that it was indeed legitimate for Respondent to invoke its contractual grounds for terminating the Concession Contract, this would exclude a finding of an expropriation, despite the parallel existence of public policy reasons. The issues for determining an expropriation in the context of a contract termination are (i) whether the contract is terminated by the contractual procedure rather than a legislative act or executive decree, and (ii) whether there exists a legitimate contractual basis for termination, *i.e.,* (a) the contract or the governing law provides the ground for termination, (b) the evidence substantiates a factual basis for invoking the contractual ground, and (c) the State acts in good faith, not abusing its right by a fictitious or malicious exercise of it.\n\n**E. Did Respondent Have Public Policy Reasons for Terminating the Concession Contract?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nAs noted above, the first question for the Tribunal to answer is whether it can conclude, on the basis of the evidence, that Respondent had public policy reasons for terminating the Concession Contract, and thus acted in its sovereign capacity.\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent destroyed the Project through its sovereign conduct and that the present dispute therefore does not arise out of Respondent\u2019s ordinary good faith regulation or commercial conduct. In this respect, Claimant states that, following the signing of the Concession Contract and, in particular, following the election of the new Fidesz Government, it became typical for Respondent to communicate with Claimant via public statements and the media. Claimant refers to Dr. Budai\u2019s announcement of the revocation of Special Project Status at a press conference a day before the Government Decree of 23 September 2010 was issued as well as Dr. Budai\u2019s announcement of the termination of the Concession Contract at a press conference days prior to Respondent\u2019s formal notification to KC Bidding. Claimant submits that this is not the conduct of a good faith contractual counterparty.359\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 139.\n\n334.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Dr. Budai\u2019s pervasive role as an organ of the State, including his central role in the termination of the Concession Contract, *\"embodies\"* Respondent\u2019s expropriatory intent.360\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 140.\n\n335.\n\nClaimant further submits that the application of international law principles of attribution demonstrates that Respondent was acting in its sovereign capacity and exercising *puissance publique* when it terminated the Concession Contract.361\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 144.\n\n336.\n\nClaimant asserts that both components of an internationally wrongful act, - (i) it must be attributable to the State and (ii) it must constitute a breach of an international obligation - are met in this case and that Respondent\u2019s State organs were, by definition, acting in a sovereign capacity.362\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 145, 148.\n\n337.\n\nClaimant refers to the case of *Al-Kharafi v. Libya* in which the tribunal held:\n\n*\"The contract signed between the Plaintiff and the Libyan party was preceded by a license from the Libyan Minister of Tourism, which gives the parties participating a clear governmental character that reinforces the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s conviction regarding the intervention of Libyan government bodies in the contract conclusion, performance and termination\"363*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 149; *Mohamed Abdulmohsen Al-Kharafi & Sons Co. v. Libya and others,* Final Arbitral Award (22 March 2013), **Exhibit CLA-128,** p. 250.\n\n338.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, it is beyond serious argument that Respondent\u2019s conduct was of a governmental character, which is demonstrated, *inter alia,* by\n\n- the extensive and frequent interaction between the Project Sponsors and Respondent\u2019s ministers, senior officials and officers throughout 2007-2009, culminating in the signature of the Concession Contract;\n\n- the active encouragement and support of the Project at all relevant levels of the State;\n\n- the award (and subsequent revocation) of Special Project Status and other State incentives; and\n\n- the documented circumstances surrounding the termination of the Concession Contract.364\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 150.\n\n339.\n\nIn this regard, Claimant asserts that the revocation of Special Project Status was *\"deliberately intended as a pre-cursor to the Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract and pursuit offinancial penalties\"365*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 264; *cf.* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 171.\n\n340.\n\nClaimant relies on Dr. Budai\u2019s statement in an interview on 27 October 2010:\n\n*\"The government cancelled the special status of the project, so if they wish to acquire any sort of permission or license they should do that via the established procedures, which is a far longer process. The conclusion is that they will not have any construction license or permission; therefore the state can cancel the concession agreement on the 1st of January 2011. In this case King City, represented by Joav Blum, will have to pay the state a penalty of900 million HUF.\"366*\n\n**Exhibit C-231.**\n\n341.\n\nClaimant further refers to two letters from Dr. Budai to Minister Matolcsy dated 5 October 2010367 and to Dr. Roza Nagy dated 6 January 2011,368 in which Dr. Budai *\"pressed for the termination\"* of the Concession Contract, specifically noting that the Ministry should give *\"special consideration to the fact that that the Special Project Status of the King\u2019s City investment was revoked by the government\"369*\n\n**Exhibit R-150.**\n\n**Exhibit R-159.**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 171.\n\n342.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, the Government proposal for the revocation of Special Project Status370 was another reason why Dr. Budai in particular was *\"acutely aware\"* that that the revocation would *\"severely impede\"* Claimant\u2019s ability to comply with the contractual deadline.371\n\n**Exhibit R-94.**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 62.\n\n343.\n\nClaimant submits that Dr. Kardkov\u00e1cs, Deputy State Secretary at the Ministry of National Economy, *\"is another manifestation of the Fidesz government\u2019s linkage between the revocation of Special Project Status and termination of the Concession Contract.\"372* Claimant refers to a letter from Dr. Kardkov\u00e1cs to Mr. Langhammer dated 17 December 2010,373 in which he declared that the incentives package had *\"expired\u2019* (instead of being *\"suspended,\"* as the Government had previously phrased it), and to the Government proposal for the revocation of Special Project Status,374 prepared by Dr. Kardkov\u00e1cs.375 Claimant contends that Dr. Kardkov\u00e1cs\u2019 *\"pervasive role\"* (alongside that of Dr. Budai) confirmed Respondent\u2019s view that the revocation of Special Project Status, the withdrawal of incentives and the termination of the Concession Contract were *\"closely linked.\"376*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, note 113.\n\n**Exhibit C-234.**\n\n**Exhibit R-94.**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, note 113.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 59.\n\n344.\n\nClaimant submits that the revocation of Special Project Status, besides being a clear signal that Respondent was no longer committed to the Project, made it *\"more difficult (if not impossible) in practical terms\"* to realize the Project.377 Claimant contends that Special Project Status was in fact cancelled to ensure that KC Bidding would be unable to fulfil the conditions of the Concession Contract by 1 January 2011, which would in turn give Respondent the right to cancel the Concession Contract.378\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 172.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 477.\n\n345.\n\nClaimant concludes that the Fidesz Government had a political agenda behind terminating the Concession Contract, with the aim of destroying the Project.379 Claimant refers in particular to:\n\n- the conflation of the Land Swap Agreement and the Concession Contract, which led to the stonewalling of the Project Sponsors and the Project;380\n\n- the revocation of Special Project Status and the egregious manner in which this was conducted;381\n\n- the suspension and cancellation of incentives promised to the Project;382\n\n- false changes in Government policy towards environmental protection and tourism in Hungary;383 and\n\n- the commencement of multiple penalty lawsuits against Mr. Lauder.384\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 151 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 153 *et seq;* \u00b6\u00b6 166 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 169 *et seq; \u00b6\u00b6* 174 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 181.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 182 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 192 *et seq.*\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant has failed to establish that the termination of the Concession Contract was more than a legitimate contractual response to KC Bidding\u2019s contractual breaches.385 According to Respondent, Hungary terminated the Concession Contract in its capacity as an ordinary contracting party, without invoking any of its sovereign prerogatives.386\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 281; *cf.* Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 214.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 215.\n\n347.\n\nRespondent submits that, on 21 December 2010, KC Bidding certified to the Ministry of National Economy that SDI Europe had acquired lawful possession of, and the right to build on, the Sukoro Site.387 The Ministry, however, was advised by its external legal counsel that, in view of the pending Land Swap Litigation, SDI Europe could not have acquired such rights, and that the Ministry was accordingly entitled to terminate the Concession Contract with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.1. Respondent refers to Dr. Roza Nagy\u2019s witness statement, in which she stated: *\"[T]here was no* *question that KC Bidding was in breach of the Concession Contract and that the Ministry was accordingly entitled to terminate the Concession Contract on that basis\"388*\n\n**Exhibit C-203.**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 215; Nagy, \u00b6 41.\n\n348.\n\nRespondent further submits that, on 6 January 2011, the Ministry organized a working-level meeting to discuss the proposed termination of the Concession Contract. In a memorandum dated 7 January 2011, prepared for Minister Matolcsy, Dr. Kardkov\u00e1cs and Dr. K\u00f3r\u00f3smezei explained that KC Bidding had failed to meet certain of its contractual obligations and that the Ministry was accordingly entitled to terminate the Concession Contract with immediate effect and claim frustration penalties.389 Respondent further submits that the Legal and Codification Department of the Ministry of National Economy thus recommended in this memorandum the termination of the Concession Contract on the basis of those breaches and the Concession Contract was accordingly terminated on 10 January 2011.390\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 281; **Exhibit R-160.**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 215.\n\n349.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that the Termination Letter specifically refers to the grounds for termination invoked by the Ministry and describes KC Bidding\u2019s various breaches of the Concession Contract, thus making it indistinguishable from a notice of termination that could have been sent by a private party.391\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 215; Rejoinder, \u00b6 281; **Exhibit R-lll.**\n\n350.\n\nRespondent concludes that the termination of the Concession Contract was carried out within the framework of the parties\u2019 contractual relations, on the basis of purely contractual considerations relating to KC Bidding\u2019s contractual breaches.392\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 282.\n\n351.\n\nWith regard to Claimant\u2019s assertion that Dr. Budai instigated and brought about Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract, Respondent acknowledges that Dr. Budai had indeed written to the Ministry of National Economy on 5 October 2010 requesting that it *\"consider the termination of the Concession Contract on 1 January 201 J\"393* Respondent submits, however, that Dr. Roza Nagy explained to Dr. Budai that as Claimant *\"ha[d] until the end of 2010 to comply with the relevant clauses,* [and] *the termination of the concession contract, as of today, is untimely\"394* Respondent contends that Dr. Budai\u2019s attempts to interfere with the Concession Contract were thus *\"authoritatively shot down\"* by the Ministry of National Economy.395\n\n**Exhibit R-155**\n\n**Exhibit R-156.**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 217.\n\n352.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant\u2019s suggestion that Dr. Budai expressed the view of the Government in his interview on 27 October 2010,396 in which he linked the revocation of Special Project Status to the termination of the Concession Contract. Respondent asserts that Claimant quoted only part of the document to support its allegation that Dr. Budai had proposed to Minister Fellegi to cancel the Concession Contract. Respondent submits that Minister Fellegi does not recall being approached by Dr. Budai to discuss the Concession Contract or the Sukoro transaction. In any event, Respondent refers to Minister Fellegi\u2019s first witness statement, in which he stated that *\"Dr. Budai was not a* *member of the Cabinet and had no authority or influence over any decisions made by the government.397*\n\n**Exhibit C-231.**\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 403; Fellegi I, \u00b6 16.\n\n353.\n\nRespondent further contends that both Dr. Budai and Claimant misunderstand the scope of the revocation of Special Project Status, which had been limited in its application to the implementation of the Project *\"in the outskirts of Sukoro.\"398* Respondent submits that Special Project Status was Sukor\u00f3-specific and would not have been of any assistance in securing an alternative Project site by the 1 January 2011 deadline.399 In Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant does not dispute that fact.400 Respondent refers to Dr. Roza Nagy\u2019s testimony during the Hearing, in which she stated that Special Project Status *\"would not have been revoked if the Sukoro site had remained available for the Project.\"401*\n\n**Exhibit C-42.**\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 404; *cf.* Rejoinder, \u00b6 152.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 153.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 174; Transcript, p. 1397, lines 5-7.\n\n354.\n\nWith regard to the Sukoro Site, Respondent refers to Article 2(2) of Government Decree 83/2009 (IV. IO)402 and the statement of its expert Prof. Kir\u00e1ly that Special Project Status could not have served to expedite the registration of Mr. Blum\u2019s interest in the Sukoro Site because the Government Decree came into force after the registration procedure had already been initiated. Respondent submits that the revocation was thus *\"inconsequential\"* to KC Bidding\u2019s obligations to secure a Project site within the deadline and did not contribute in any way to the termination grounds.403\n\nArticle 2(2) stipulates that *\"the provisions of the present decree shall be applicable in the ajfairs commenced after its entry into force.\"*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 405; Kir\u00e1ly I, Section 9.\n\n355.\n\nRespondent notes that the Government proposal for the revocation of Special Project Status does not refer to the Concession Contract or the contractual deadline for securing a Project site.404 Respondent refers to Minister Fellegi\u2019s first witness statement, in which he stated that *\"[t]he termination of the Concession Contract was not raised in the proposal for the revocation of the special project status and was not discussed during the government session when the revocation was approved\"405*\n\n**Exhibit R-94.**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 170; Fellegi 1,\u00b6 13.\n\n356.\n\nRespondent states that Dr. Budai, who, as Respondent acknowledges, did indeed connect the revocation of the Special Project Status and the termination of the Concession Contract, was not involved in the process leading up to the revocation, as he did not participate in the preparation of the Government proposal or the 16 September 2010 meeting of the Administrative Secretaries in which the proposal was approved.406\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 171.\n\n357.\n\nIn response to Claimant\u2019s allegation that Dr. Budai was a *\"vociferous critic of the Project and the Project Sponsors,\"* Respondent submits that Dr. Budai was *\"indeed a* \u2018vociferous critic\u2019, *not of the Project, but of the Land Swap Agreement and of its direct consequence: the implementation of the Project in Sukor\u00f3.\"* Respondent contends that Dr. Budai referred to the Sukor\u00f3 Site in all of his press interventions relied upon by Claimant, which shows that his concerns related to the Land Swap Agreement and the implementation of the Project in Sukor\u00f3, as well as *\"other Sukor\u00f3-related ancillary matters such as the grant of the Sukor\u00f3-specific special project status and the Incentives A greement. \"407*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 107.\n\n358.\n\nRespondent asserts that the excerpt from the 27 October 2010 interview408 confirms that Dr. Budai always referred to the Sukor\u00f3 land swap and that it demonstrates that Dr. Budai did not know that Claimant intended to implement the Project elsewhere than in Sukor\u00f3. Furthermore, Respondent is of the view that the interview shows that Dr. Budai had no understanding of the reasons that led to the revocation of Special Project Status and that the Sukor\u00f3-specific status could not assist Claimant in its search for an alternative site. Respondent submits that this *\"demonstrates* ad absurdum *that Dr. Budai cannot have played the role which the Claimant now lends him\"409*\n\n**Exhibit C-231.**\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 107; *cf.* Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 172.\n\n359.\n\nRespondent submits that Dr. Budai was only invited to participate in the 6 January 2011 meeting because KC Bidding had chosen to designate the Sukor\u00f3 Site as the Project site and the Land Swap Agreement had therefore become very relevant in determining whether KC Bidding had complied with its obligation to lawfully acquire possession of, and the right to build on, the Project site.410\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 220.\n\n360.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that neither the Termination Letter nor any of the Ministry\u2019s internal memoranda refer to the revocation of Special Project Status, which is, Respondent submits, *\"for the simple reason that the special project status had no incidence on the purported transfer of possession and the right to build on the Sukoro site (or, for that matter, on the* [sic] *Vigotop\u2019s and KC Bidding\u2019s search for an alternative Project site.\"411* Respondent adds that Hungary never relied upon or otherwise referred to the revocation to justify or defend the termination of the Concession Contract.412\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 218.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 170.\n\n361.\n\nRespondent concludes that there is no connection between the revocation of Special Project Status and the termination of the Concession Contract and reiterates that it terminated the Concession Contract for the simple reason that KC Bidding failed to secure a Project site by the contractual deadline of 1 January 2011.413\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 219, 221.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n362.\n\nAs noted above, it is Claimant\u2019s case that the Fidesz Government had a *\"hiddenpolitical agenda\"* behind terminating the Concession Contract and thereby destroying the Project. According to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s revocation of Special Project Status was a key step in this agenda and was particularly egregious, given the manner in which it was carried out. Claimant further submits that the Fidesz Government\u2019s conflation of the Land Swap Agreement and the Concession Contract led to the stonewalling of the Project Sponsors and the Project and the withdrawal of its promises of financial and other support. Claimant further submits that Respondent\u2019s agenda to destroy the Project was underpinned by changes in Government policy in relation to environmental protection and tourism in Hungary. Claimant submits that Respondent\u2019s *\"malicious intent\"* was further evidenced by its commencement of multiple penalty lawsuits against Mr. Lauder. In Claimant\u2019s view, the Termination Letter was the final measure in a line of wrongful exercises of sovereign power that cumulatively deprived Claimant of its investment.414 The Tribunal also notes that Mr. Langhammer testified he was offended by this treatment and stated: \"[I]n *all my 40 years of experience, I\u2019ve never been treated like this by any Government\"415*\n\n*Cf* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 151 *et seq.*\n\nTranscript, p. 975, lines 3-14.\n\n363.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that its jurisdiction does not extend to determining a breach of the FET standard; it will therefore express no view as to the fairness of Respondent\u2019s conduct, including the Government\u2019s imposition on Claimant or its surety Mr. Lauder of *\"penalties] for frustration\"416* of the Concession Contract despite the fact that the new Government had previously withdrawn its active support for the Project and had determined by at least the fall of 2010 that, *\"[a]ccording to the new plans of the government - based on environmental and touristic considerations -* [the Project] *shall not be implemented at Sukor\u00f3.\"417* Instead, the Tribunal must focus on the expropriation issue and determine, as a first step, whether there is sufficient evidence that Respondent had public policy reasons for terminating the Concession Contract, and thus whether it acted in its sovereign capacity.\n\n*Cf.* Clauses 12.5.1 and 12.5.5 of the Concession Contract **(Exhibit C-l).**\n\n**Exhibit R-94.**\n\n364.\n\nIn reviewing the evidence submitted by the Parties in these proceedings, the Tribunal has identified a number of pieces of evidence that it considers to be particularly pertinent to determining whether Respondent had public policy reasons for terminating the Concession Contract. The Tribunal will examine this evidence in chronological order below, grouping it into three different time periods: (i) the period prior to the signing of the Concession Contract on 9 October 2009; (ii) the period between the signing of the Concession Contract and the change of government, *i.e.,* the assumption of office by Dr. Orb\u00e1n, leader of the Fidesz Party, as Prime Minister on 29 May 2010; and (iii) the period following the change of government. In addition, the Tribunal will examine Dr. Budai\u2019s actions following his appointment as Prime Minister\u2019s Commissioner in June 2010.\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that to the extent certain statements were made by members of the Fidesz Party while it was in opposition, they cannot be attributed to Respondent. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers such statements to be relevant in that they may inform the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion as to the Government\u2019s policy relating to casino projects in Hungary generally after the Fidesz Party took power on 29 May 2010.\n\n366.\n\nAs to Dr. Budai\u2019s various statements, the Tribunal considers it necessary to distinguish between the time periods before and after his appointment as Prime Minister\u2019s Commissioner on 8 June 2010 and concludes that only the latter can be attributed to Respondent. Contrary to what Claimant alleges,418 the mere fact that Dr. Budai was a member of the supervisory board of a State organization - before Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n appointed him as his Commissioner - is not sufficient to render his conduct attributable to Respondent. However, contrary to Respondent\u2019s contention,419 Dr. Budai\u2019s conduct following his appointment as Prime Minister\u2019s Commissioner on 8 June 2010 can be attributed to Respondent. Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n appointed Dr. Budai his Commissioner by way of a Government Decree420 and Dr. Budai reported directly to the Prime Minister. His position is also reflected in his official communications in which he used the letterhead *\"OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER - DP GYULA BUDAI\"* followed either by *\"Prime Minister\u2019s Commissioner\"421* or by *\"government commissioner.\"422* In these circumstances, it is clear that the acts and statements of Dr. Budai in his capacity as the Prime Minister\u2019s Commissioner are attributable to Respondent.\n\nReply, \u00b6 230.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 403.\n\n**Exhibit R-179.**\n\n**Exhibits C-383** and **C-395.**\n\n**Exhibits R-150** and **R-159.** Even though the English translation of **Exhibit R-150** (dated 5 October 2010) uses the word *\"government commissioner\"* instead of *\"Prime Minister\u2019s Commissioner\"* and therefore suggests that Dr. Budai used this title prior to his appointment as Government Commissioner on 9 November 2010, the original Hungarian term *\"miniszterelnoki megbizott\"* is identical to the Hungarian term used in **Exhibits C-383** and **C-395.** By contrast, the Hungarian term in **Exhibit R-159** (dated 6 January 2011) is *\"elsz\u00e1moltat\u00e1si \u00e9s korrupci\u00f3-ellenes korm\u00e1nybiztos,\"* which confirms that Dr. Budai did not use the same title before and after his appointment as Government Commissioner in November 2010.\n\n367.\n\nIn reviewing the evidence, the Tribunal will also determine whether Respondent had public policy concerns relating to the Project as a whole, or whether any such concerns were directed only at the establishment of the Project at Sukoro.\n\n**a) The Period Prior to the Signing of the Concession Contract**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nThe first statement in the record documenting the Fidesz Party\u2019s opposition to the Project at Sukoro is dated 15 August 2009. On that day, Mr. Istv\u00e1n Baisai, Vice President of the General Assembly of Fej\u00e9r County and a member of the Fidesz Party, gave a speech, in which he stated that they would *\"save the area of the Lake Velencei by preventing* [the King\u2019s City] *project\"423*\n\n**Exhibit C-357.**\n\n369.\n\nIn a press conference also on 15 August 2009, Dr. Budai, then Association Director of MAGOSZ (National Association of Hungarian Farmers\u2019 Societies and Cooperatives), announced that the Fejer County Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office had indicted Mr. Blum on charges of forging public documents on the basis that Mr. Blum *\"was not habitually residing or accessible at the home address which he specified\"424* Dr. Budai referred to Mr. Blum as an *\"impostor\"* and a *\"fraudster\"* and further stated that there had been a *\"series of fiaud[s]\"* in relation to the Land Swap Agreement.425\n\n**Exhibit C-267.**\n\n**Exhibits C-267 and C-122.**\n\n370.\n\nIn an interview on Echo TV on 17 August 2009, Dr. Budai stated that, as early as December 2008, he had voiced his suspicions of corruption in relation to the land swap transaction to Mr. Tatrai, then CEO of the MNV, as well as to the chairman of the Audit Committee of the Land Fund Management Agency. Dr. Budai reiterated that *\"we are faced with serial fraud here\"* and stated that, due to the forgery of public documents by Mr. Blum, *\"the whole land swap can be considered legally invalid\"426*\n\n**Exhibit C-268.**\n\n371.\n\nOn 27 August 2009, Dr. Budai participated in a further press conference, at which he stated that it was a *\"fact that the King\u2019s City casino project in Sukoro [...] will not be implemented\"* In his view, *\"the Sukoro project is a large-scale theft supported by the government.\"* On this occasion, Dr. Budai also announced that, in the event of a change in government, *\"every person [...] responsible for wasting several hundred million Forints of the taxpayers in such a way, will be called to account\"427*\n\n**Exhibit C-339.**\n\n372.\n\nOn 28 August 2009, the Fidesz Party issued a press release, in which it cited Mr. Bal-sai\u2019s stating at a press conference: *\"No casino will be built here* [at Sukoro]\" because the *\"processes around it are illegal\"* Mr. Balsai further stated:\n\n\"[I]f *so much as one single stone is turned in connection with this investment, the new government that would take office in a few months will* \u2018undo it\u2019 *without legal consequences or any compensation to the investors. [...] We wish to once again call upon the government, to cancel this project for good and forget about it\"428*\n\n**Exhibit C-98.**\n\n373.\n\nDuring the same press conference, another Fidesz politician, Mr. Andras Cser-Palkovics, mentioned that there were, *inter alia, \"environmental problems,\"* which were part of *\"the negative effects of this case on the sporting life of this area\"429*\n\n**Exhibit C-98.**\n\n374.\n\nOn 18 September 2009, Dr. Orb\u00e1n, then leader of the opposition Fidesz Party, participated in an interview on HirTV and was asked about *\"the Sukoro casino at Lake Velencei.\"* In relation to the casino industry generally, Dr. Orb\u00e1n commented that:\n\n*\"The situation is even worse than that. [...] I saw a whole map, a campaign plan describing about seven or eight large casino cities that they want to create in the country. [...] In Hungary\u2019s economic policy strategy, the goal to transform Hungary into a* \u2018casino country\u2019, *a gambling country, so that our country would have the largest casino industry in Europe, this was not included in the government program. [... ] This is a secret plan [... ].\"430*\n\n**Exhibit C-302.**\n\n375.\n\nWith respect to Sukor\u00f3, Dr. Orb\u00e1n referred to Mr. Balsai\u2019s statement of 28 August 2009 and stated:\n\n*\"All I can say is what one of the parliamentary representatives of FIDESZ has said: not even a single shovel of earth is worth moving there. We will reinstate [...] I support the idea that, since we live in a democracy, that we should have a meaningful discussion how Hungary would want to fit in the global casino industry. Do we want to be Europe\u2019s casino dumping ground. [...] Let us discuss it. Not only in Parliament, in general, and then let us make a decision in the matter. But this dispute has not taken place. No one has made a decision about this matter, and this plan would fundamentally transform the character of the Hungarian economy.

However, the government has brought its decision in the matter.\"* Dr. Budai further stated that Special Project Status should not have been granted by the previous Government, as the *\"legal conditions\"* had never been in place because the Concession Contract had not been signed at the time the status was granted. Similarly, he considered that *\"the allocation of HUF 2.6 billion to the investor, as a state support* [was] *without any legal grounds\"* Dr. Budai concluded that former Prime Ministers Gyurcs\u00e1ny and Bajnai both *\"must have known about these facts\"* and *\"their actions may be deemed as abuse of power\"476*\n\n**Exhibit C-169.**\n\n407.\n\nIn a letter to Minister Matolcsy dated 5 October 2010, Dr. Budai referred to *\"[t]he full scale investigation of the King\u2019s city investment\"* and quoted from various provisions of the Concession Contract. He concluded:\n\n*\"The acquisition of the Sukor\u00f3 properties for the activity described by the concession contract within the deadline is very doubtful at the moment, since there is an ongoing lawsuit to revoke the Sukor\u00f3-Albertirsa land swap agreement and to reinstate the original conditions.*\n\n*Based on the foregoing, please consider the termination of the concession contract on 1 January, 2011, with special consideration to the fact that the special project status of the King\u2019s city investment was revoked by the government.\"477*\n\n**Exhibit R-150.**\n\n408.\n\nDr. Roza Nagy responded to Dr. Budai\u2019s letter by letter of 17 November 2010:\n\n*\"We have examined all grounds for termination set out in concession contract concluded between the Ministry of Finance and KC Bidding Kft. on 9 October 2009 - including the ones referenced in your letter - and we have found that the concession contract shall be terminated only after 1 January 2011, on the condition that the Concession Receiver fails to comply with the clauses referenced in your letter.* *However, since the Concession Receiver has until the end of 2010 to comply with the relevant clauses, the termination of the concession contract, as of today, is untimely.\"478*\n\n**Exhibit R-156.**\n\n409.\n\nOn 27 October 2010, Dr. Budai participated in an interview with *Magyar Demokrata* magazine, in which he linked the revocation of Special Project Status with the potential termination of the Concession Contract:\n\n[I]f [the Project Sponsors] *wish to acquire any sort of permission or license they should do that via the established procedures, which is a far longer process. The conclusion is that they will not have any construction license or permission; therefore the state can cancel the concession agreement on the 1st of January 2011. In this case King City [... ] will have to pay the state a penalty of900 million HUF.\"479*\n\n**Exhibit C-231.**\n\n410.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that Dr. Roza Nagy stated in her witness statement that she considered that the revocation of Special Project Status would have *\"no consequences [...] on Hungary\u2019s obligations to the King\u2019s city investors\"480* and *\"no incidence on the Concession Contract.\"481*\n\nNagy, \u00b615.\n\nNagy, \u00b6 19.\n\n411.\n\nMinister Fellegi stated in his first witness statement:\n\n*\"The termination of the Concession Contract was not raised in the government proposal for the revocation of the special project status and was not discussed during the government session when the revocation was approved.\"482*\n\nFellegi I, \u00b6 13.\n\n412.\n\nFollowing the expiration of the contractual deadline on 1 January 2011, in an interview with *Magyar Nemzet* on 5 January 2011, Dr. Budai stated that *\"the government\u2019s standpoint is clear: there will not be a casino in Sukor\u00f3\"* In his view, the fact that the Project Sponsors had named the Sukor\u00f3 Site as the final site for the Project was *\"nothing better than a joke\"* According to Dr. Budai, *\"the concession right of the investor of King\u2019s City automatically expired on 1 January 2011\"* and KC Bidding would now have to pay HUF 900 million as penalty fees to the Hungarian State.483\n\n**Exhibit C-346.**\n\n413.\n\nOn 6 January 2011, Dr. Budai participated in a working-level meeting with representatives of the Government, in which the possibility of terminating the Concession Contract and the State\u2019s claim for a penalty for frustration were discussed.484 In a letter to Dr. Roza Nagy of the same day, Dr. Budai cited various provisions of the Concession Contract and explained why he considered them to have been breached. He concluded:\n\n*\"Based on the foregoing, and with due consideration to the fact that the deadline stipulated in the concession contract is overdue, I repeatedly request* [sic] *the termination of the concession contract with immediate effect, with special consideration to the fact that the special project status of the King\u2019s City investment was revoked by the*  *government.\"*485\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Dr. Roza Nagy stated in her witness statement that she had \"no *recollection* o/[the 6 January 2011] *meeting\"* and assumed that it was only held \"to *inform all parties of the Ministry\u2019s decision to terminate the Concession Contract\"* Nagy, \u2018 44. Respondent does not contest, however, that this meeting took place and that Dr. Budai participated in it. Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 220. The memorandum for Minister Matolcsy, prepared by Dr. Kardkov\u00e1cs and Dr. K\u00f3r\u00f3smezei on 7 January 2011, also refers to the meeting (mistakenly referred to as the meeting of 6 January 2010) having been held *\"with the participation of government commissioner Gyula Budai.\"* **Exhibit R-160.**\n\n**Exhibit R-159.** Dr. Roza Nagy stated in her witness statement that Dr. Budai\u2019s letter was located in the archives of the Ministry of National Economy, even though she had \"no *recollection of receiving this letter.\"* Nagy, **\u00b6 45.**\n\n414.\n\nOn 7 January 2011, the newspaper *Magyar Nemzet* reported that the Concession Contract was *\"likely to be cancelled\u2019* and referred to government commissioner Dr. Budai who had told the paper after a meeting at the Government Audit Office the day before that *\"representatives of the affected ministries and the audit office were in agreement that the contract should be cancelled\u2019* because Mr. Blum and KC Bidding *\"have failed to meet the conditions included in the concession contract.\"486*\n\n**Exhibit C-201.**\n\n415.\n\nOn 8 January 2011, the Fidesz Party issued a press release, according to which Dr. Budai said: *\"In Sukor\u00f3 no casino city is going to be built, neither now, nor in the future\"* and further that he had turned to Minister Matolcsy on 5 January 2011 *\"with the issue to terminate immediately the concession agreement\"* Dr. Budai announced that *\"[t]his termination is going to be made in writing during the next week\"* and added that he had requested that the Minister demand the contractual penalty of HUF 900 million. Dr. Budai concluded:\n\n*\" With investors who intend to outmaneuver the regulations, or ignoring them, and who wish to validate their individual interests at the expense of others, the government does not wish to negotiate, neither now nor in the future. The fact is that the management of KC Bidding and King\u2019s City belongs to this circle.\"487*\n\n**Exhibit C-123.**\n\n**e) The Tribunal\u2019s Evaluation of the Evidence**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot but note the strong attacks on the Project at Sukor\u00f3 and the sometimes inflammatory language employed by Dr. Budai and certain other representatives of the Fidesz Party. Many of the incidental actors in this case brought and won defamation actions in the courts of Hungary against Dr. Budai for some of his public statements, including Dr. Kl\u00e1ra Horv\u00e1th (Mayor of B\u00e1bolna),488 Mr. Mikl\u00f3s T\u00e1trai (former CEO of the MNV)489 and former Prime Ministers Bajnai and Gyurcs\u00e1ny.490 Ultimately, Dr. Budai was dismissed from his position as the Prime Minister\u2019s Commissioner as of 31 August 2012.491 The Tribunal notes the foregoing in evaluating the evidence, without losing sight of the fact that many of these statements were made in the context of the upcoming national elections in April 2010.\n\nOn 8 November 2011, the Budapest Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Municipal Court of Budapest at the first instance that, in making false allegations at a press conference on 16 August 2010 regarding the falsification of public documents and linking her to corruption cases, Dr. Budai had unlawfully damaged the Mayor of B\u00e1bolna\u2019s reputation, and ordered the Fidesz Party and Dr. Budai to publish the judgment on the Fidesz Party\u2019s website for at least 30 days and to express their regret over the violations of Hungarian law and to pay damages. **Exhibits C-143** and **C-311.**\n\nOn 17 July 2012, the Metropolitan Court ordered Dr. Budai to publicly apologize and pay damages to Mr. T\u00e1trai for falsely accusing Mr. T\u00e1trai of accepting funds related to the B\u00e1bolna case. **Exhibit C-174.**\n\nOn 27 September 2012, the Court of Budapest Region ordered Dr. Budai to publicly apologize to former Prime Ministers Bajnai and Gyurcs\u00e1ny and to pay HUF 300,000 to each of them for the damage caused to their reputations by stating at a press conference on 28 July 2010 that there were documents proving that the former Prime Ministers had witnessed falsely in the prosecution. **Exhibit C-312.**\n\n**Exhibit C-179.**\n\n417.\n\nIn summary, the above evidence shows that the Fidesz Government had essentially three reasons for opposing the realization of the Project at Sukor\u00f3. First, the Government suspected corruption in connection with the Land Swap Agreement. Second, it adopted the position that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void - building upon the actions of the MNV under the interim Government of Prime Minister Bajnai, which had initiated a lawsuit before the Hungarian courts in November 2009 to *\"restore the original status.\"* Third, the Government had developed new environmental and eco-tourism policies applicable to the Lake Velence region. The Tribunal is of the view that, if established, the environmental and touristic policies and the anticorruption concerns would constitute true public policy reasons for opposing the implementation of the Project at Sukor\u00f3. The Tribunal will therefore discuss these possible reasons in detail.\n\n**(i) The Anti-Corruption Concerns**\n------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nAs regards the anti-corruption concerns, the above evidence shows that the Fidesz Party had made the fight against suspected corruption in the former Socialist Government, including the interim Government of Prime Minister Bajnai, a major issue of its election campaign and that Sukor\u00f3 was one of the cases on its *\"10+1\"* list to be investigated after the change of government. The record shows that, once in office, Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n appointed Dr. Budai as his Commissioner *\"responsible for the investigation of the unlawful sale and privatization of state lands\"492* Not only did this investigation include Sukor\u00f3 and the Land Swap Agreement, but Dr. Budai regarded this particular case as a priority task.\n\n**Exhibit R-179.** *See* \u00b6 398 above.\n\n419.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, these documents evidence that the allegations of corruption were not only a major issue in the Fidesz election campaign, but continued to be an important political reason for the Fidesz Government\u2019s opposition to the implementation of the Project at Sukor\u00f3.\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at this point that none of the allegations of corruption were ultimately proven and the investigations into former Prime Minister Gyurcs\u00e1ny relating to the crime of abuse of administrative authority were terminated on 30 July 2012 *\"because of failure to prove.\"493* The Tribunal also notes that Dr. Cs\u00e1szy and Mr. T\u00e1trai of the MNV, who were at one time arrested and detained after the Fidesz Government took power,494 were ultimately never charged with corruption in connection with the land swap.495\n\n**Exhibit C-353**\n\nCs\u00e1szy I, I) 70; T\u00e1trai I, \u00b6\u00b6 41 *et seq.*\n\nAccording to a news article published by MTI on 5 July 2012, the Tatab\u00e1nya Court acquitted Mr. T\u00e1trai from the accusation of misappropriation causing asset detriment of high value. **Exhibit C-173.** Dr. Cs\u00e1szy\u2019s teshmony during the Hearing that he was never found guilty of the crime of corruption was not challenged during cross-examination. Transcript, p. 1135 lines 14-19.\n\n421.\n\nNevertheless, the above evidence shows that anti-corruption, in particular relating to the Sukor\u00f3 land swap (even if unfounded), constituted a public policy concern of the Fidesz Government and that, after the Concession Company certified Sukor\u00f3 as the Project site, such public policy concern may well have played a role in the Government\u2019s decision to terminate the Concession Contract. In particular, Dr. Budai\u2019s statements following the expiration of the contractual deadline on 1 January 2011 and his apparent involvement in the decision-making process leading up to the termination on 10 January 2011496 indicate that the suspicions of corruption, which were his primary concern as Prime Minister\u2019s Commissioner investigating into the Sukor\u00f3 land swap, may have influenced the Government\u2019s decision to terminate the Concession Contract after it had become certain that the Project Sponsors intended to implement the Project at Sukor\u00f3 (based on the very land swap that Dr. Budai was tasked to investigate).\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 414-417 above.\n\n**(ii) New Environmental and Touristic Policies**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nAs to the environmental and touristic policy reasons, the Tribunal notes that most of the documents submitted as evidence by Claimant specifically relate to Sukor\u00f3; there are only a few pieces of evidence that could suggest a broader public policy against casino projects in Hungary generally.\n\n423.\n\nAs regards the statements of local politicians of Fej\u00e9r County,497 even though their language does not always appear to be limited to the implementation of the Project at Sukor\u00f3, it seems reasonably clear from the context in which those statements were made that the concerns of those politicians related primarily to the future of the Lake Velence region.\n\n*See \u00b6\u00b6* 370, 374-375 and 397 above.\n\n424.\n\nBy contrast, the comments made by Dr. Orb\u00e1n, then leader of the opposition party, during a TV interview on 18 September 2009, *(i.e.,* before the Concession Contract was signed),498 do reveal an aversion on his part (and by extension the Fidesz Party) to the concept of a casino industry in Hungary.\n\n**Exhibit C-302.** *See* \u00b6 376 above.\n\n425.\n\nIn addition, there is evidence relating to the potential alternative site in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. The Tribunal notes that, while the resolution proposed by Dr. Balogh on 17 December 2009499 was never passed and her opinion therefore cannot necessarily be taken to reflect the position of the Fej\u00e9r County General Assembly, the statement made by Mr. Cser-Palkovic as assistant spokesman for the Fidesz Party on 15 January 20IO500 and, in particular, the press release issued by the Fidesz Party on 6 April 2010,501 in which it refers to its own *\"initiative\"* that led the local government of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r to withdraw its consent to the Project, do suggest that the Fidesz Party actively sought to ensure that Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r would not be available as a Project site and thus also suggest that it was opposed to the Project as a whole.\n\n**Exhibit C-328.** *See* \u00b6 383 above.\n\n**Exhibit C-261.** *See* \u00b6 384 above.\n\n**Exhibit C-327.** *See* \u00b6 386 above.\n\n426.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal must have regard to the context in which those comments and statements were made. As the interview with Dr. Orb\u00e1n was conducted while the Fidesz Party was in opposition, Dr. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s statements formed part of a legitimate political discourse concerning the casino industry in Hungary, which was inevitably heightened in the campaign preceding the national elections. The statements relating to the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r site likewise need to be assessed against this background. The Tribunal further notes that the opposition of the Fidesz Party clearly did not reflect the position of the interim Government, as evidenced by Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter to the mayor of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r dated 8 March 2010.502 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter shows that the interim Government of Prime Minister Bajnai still supported the Project\u2019s realization at alternative sites, including Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. This position is also confirmed by the press release issued by the Ministry of Finance on 9 October 2009, *i.e.,* the day the Concession Contract was signed.503 The press release shows that, even though the interim Government sought to restore the pre-swap conditions with regard to the Sukor\u00f3 Site, it contemplated that the Project was still viable and that the Project Sponsors could realize the Project at one of the other possible locations.\n\n**Exhibit R-83** *See* \u00b6 385 above.\n\n**Exhibit C-128.** *See* \u00b6 380 above.\n\n427.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is of the view that the statements made by members of the Fidesz Party while in opposition may nevertheless be relevant to interpret the actions of the Fidesz Government after it took power on 29 May 2010, it also observes that, as the statements of the Fidesz Party were made in the course of an election campaign, one cannot simply assume that they would represent the official position of the Fidesz Party once in government. Experience shows that a political party may, by the very fact of being in opposition, make statements which it would not actually follow as an elected governing party, since it then becomes responsible for complying with the State\u2019s existing obligations. In particular, Dr. Roza Nagy\u2019s testimony indicates that, even though the new Government might have been opposed to casino projects such as the Project in the future, it was committed to respect those contracts that had already been concluded.504 This approach of the Fidesz Government is confirmed by Dr. Nagy\u2019s letter to Dr. Budai dated 17 November 2010, in which she stated that the Concession Contract would only be terminated *\"on the condition that the Concession Receiver fails to comply with the* [contractual] *clauses referenced in* [Dr. Budai\u2019s] *letter\"505* Dr. Kardko-v\u00e1c\u2019s letter of 17 December 2010 to Mr. Langhammer also shows that the Government intended to proceed pursuant to the provisions of the Concession Contract.506\n\nTranscript, p. 1460, lines 6-17; *cf.* Nagy, \u00b6 10. The Tribunal also notes in this regard that, notwithstanding this testimony, the evidence in the record shows that the Ministry of National Economy had plans in July 2013 to call a closed tender for ten new casino concessions to operate outside Budapest. **Exhibit C-416.**\n\n**Exhibit R-156.** *See* \u00b6 410 above.\n\n**Exhibit C-234.** *See* \u00b6 388 above.\n\n428.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, those clear statements as to the new Government\u2019s commitment to respect the Concession Contract are not refuted by Dr. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s statement in an interview on 9 September 2010, referring to the *\"casino city planned in Sukor\u00f3\"* as *\"a dead case.\"507* Even though the Tribunal considers this statement to be unequivocal evidence that Dr. Orb\u00e1n, and by extension the Fidesz Government, was opposed to the establishment of the Project at Sukor\u00f3, the Tribunal notes that the precise context in which Dr. Orb\u00e1n made this statement is unclear. It cannot be discerned from the document whether Dr. Orb\u00e1n had been questioned as to the Project as a whole and restricted his remarks to Sukor\u00f3, or whether he was only questioned about Sukor\u00f3 in the first place. As a result, the evidence is ambiguous.\n\n**Exhibit C-151.** *See* \u00b6 401 above.\n\n429.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is no conclusive evidence in the record that the new Government adopted a general policy against the implementation of the Project in Hungary, *i.e.,* that the Fidesz Government sought to prevent the Project from being realized regardless of the site that Claimant may have chosen - the *\"hidden political agenda\"* to destroy the Project alleged by Claimant.\n\n430.\n\nOn the other hand, the evidence does show that, while the Fidesz Party was mainly focused on the suspicions of corruption during its election campaign, once it was in power, it developed new environmental and touristic policies applicable to the Lake Velence region.\n\n431.\n\nThe new environmental and touristic policies first led to the revocation of the Project\u2019s Special Project Status. Minister Matolcsy\u2019s proposal for the Government on the revocation of Special Project Status, which was unanimously approved at the meeting of the Secretaries of State,508 described the new Government\u2019s position towards the Project in the following terms: *\"According to the new plans of the government - based on environmental and touristic considerations - the casino town shall not be implemented at Sukor\u00f3.\"509*\n\n**Exhibit R-146.**\n\n**Exhibit R-94.**\n\n432.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal has also looked at Dr. Budai\u2019s interview of 27 October 2010.510 The statement could indeed suggest, as argued by Claimant,511 that the Government cancelled the Special Project Status in order to make it impossible for the Project Sponsors to secure any site for the Project by 1 January 2011, which would in turn give Respondent the right to terminate the Concession Contract.\n\n**Exhibit C-231.** *See* \u00b6 409 above.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 477.\n\n433.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal notes that the termination of the Concession Contract is not mentioned in Minister Matolcsy\u2019s proposal for the revocation and, according to Minister Fellegi, it was not discussed in the Government session in which the revocation was approved.512 Dr. Roza Nagy also stated in her witness statement that the she did not consider the two events to be linked.513\n\nFellegi I, \u00b6 13. *See* \u00b6 413 above.\n\nNagy, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 19. *See* \u00b6 412 above.\n\n434.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that the Project\u2019s Special Project Status related only to the implementation of the Project *\"in the outskirts of the community of Sukor\u00f3\"514* The Tribunal therefore agrees with Respondent that the status *\"could have been of no assistance in the search for an alternative Project site and thus had no impact on KC Bidding\u2019s ability to comply with the contractual deadline to secure a Project site\"515* in any of the 132 alternative settlements.\n\n**Exhibit C-42.**\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 172.\n\n435.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal has not seen evidence sufficient to establish that Dr. Budai played any role in the process leading up to the revocation of Special Project Status. Claimant does not contend that Dr. Budai was involved in the preparation of the proposal for the Government or that he participated in the 16 September 2010 meeting of the State Secretaries or the 10 November 2010 session of the Government. Claimant only relies on a document summarizing Dr. Budai\u2019s press conference of 22 September 2010516 and asserts that it was he who announced the revocation of Special Project Status on this occasion, *i.e.,* one day before the Government Decree was signed by Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n.\n\n**Exhibit C-169.** *See* \u00b6 408 above.\n\n436.\n\nHowever, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the document referred to by Claimant does not support this allegation. Rather, properly understood, the statement quoted by Claimant that *\"the government has brought its decision in the matter\"517* does not refer to the decision to revoke Special Project Status, but rather to the decision by which the previous Government initially granted Special Project Status to the Project in April 2009.518 In any event, the document does not prove that Dr. Budai influenced the Government\u2019s decision to revoke Special Project Status.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 139.\n\n**Exhibit C-169.**\n\n437.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Minister Fellegi also stated in his first witness statement that he had *\"no recollection of being approached by Dr. Budai to discuss this matter\"* and further that Dr. Budai had *\"no authority or influence over any decisions made by the* *government.\"*519\n\nFellegi I, \u00b6 16.\n\n438.\n\nDr. Roza Nagy similarly stated in her witness statement that *\"Dr. Budai had no influence whatsoever on the decisions that were taken by the Ministry with regard to the Project.\"520* She referred in particular to Dr. Budai\u2019s request to terminate the Concession Contract in his letter of 5 October 2010521 and stated that this request was reviewed by the Ministry, which concluded that *\"the Ministry was not entitled to terminate unless and until KC Bidding fails to comply with its obligation''522* This is also confirmed by her response to Dr. Budai of 17 November 2010.523\n\nNagy, \u00b6 27.\n\n**Exhibit R-150.** *See* \u00b6 409 above.\n\nNagy, \u00b631.\n\n**Exhibit R-156.** *See* \u00b6 410 above.\n\n439.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimant has not established that Dr. Budai took part in the decision-making process regarding the revocation of Special Project Status. Consequently, the Tribunal cannot conclude from the evidence that the Government\u2019s decision to revoke Special Project Status was necessarily taken in order to make it impossible for the Project Sponsors to secure an alternative Project site by the contractual deadline of 1 January 2011, as suggested by Dr. Budai\u2019s statement of 27 October 2010.\n\n440.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the revocation does show that, under the new environmental and touristic policies of the Fidesz Government applicable to the Lake Velence region, Sukor\u00f3 was no longer acceptable as a site for the Project. Minister Fellegi and Dr. Roza Nagy both confirmed in their witness statements that, besides the new Government\u2019s position that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void, the implementation of the Project at Sukor\u00f3 would be *\"inconsistent\"524* or *\"in contradiction with\"525* the Government\u2019s new environmental and touristic policies. Thus, the Tribunal considers it established that the Government had a public policy reason for not wanting the Project to be implemented at Sukor\u00f3.\n\nFellegi II, \u00b6 12. *See* \u00b6 404 above.\n\nNagy, \u00b6 13. *See* \u00b6 406 above.\n\n**f) The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion**\n--------------------------------\n\n441.\n\nIn summary, Claimant has not established that the Fidesz Government adopted a general policy against the realization of the Project in Hungary. However, Claimant has submitted conclusive evidence that the Fidesz Government was opposed to the implementation of the Project at Sukor\u00f3 based on its new environmental and touristic policies. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, after the Project Sponsors had certified Sukor\u00f3 as the Project site, these new environmental and touristic policies constituted a public policy reason behind the termination of the Concession Contract because, as clearly stated in the - unanimously approved - Proposal for the revocation of Special Project Status, the new Government had determined that, *\"based on environmental and touristic considerations,* [the Project] *shall not be implemented at Sukor\u00f3.\"526* This would be sufficient to conclude that Respondent acted in its sovereign capacity when it terminated the Concession Contract. In addition, as stated before, the corruption concerns (although never proven) may also have played a role in the Government\u2019s decision to terminate the Concession Contract, and if so, would also constitute a public policy reason for the contractual termination.\n\n**Exhibit R-94.**\n\n442.\n\nWere this the end of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis, this could lead to a finding of expropriation. However, as noted above, the Tribunal must now determine as a further step whether Respondent - in addition to its public policy reason - also had contractual grounds for terminating the Concession Contract and, if that is the case, whether it was legitimate for Respondent to exercise its right to terminate on those grounds.\n\n**F. Did Respondent Have Contractual Grounds for Terminating the Concession Contract?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**a) Respondent\u2019s Purported Termination Grounds Do Not Justify the Termination of the Concession Contract**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n443.\n\nClaimant submits that the Termination Letter was based on improper reasons.\n\n**(i) SDI Europe Had the Legitimate Right of Possession to and the Right to Build on the Sukor\u00f3 Site**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n444.\n\nClaimant first refers to Respondent\u2019s allegation that KC Bidding breached Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract because it failed to certify that SDI Europe had the *\"legitimate right of possession\"* and the *\"right of encroachment\"* with regard to the Sukor\u00f3 Site. Clause 9.3 provides, in relevant part:\n\n*\"Starting from January 1, 2011 up to the expiry of the concession period, the Concession Company shall continuously hold the legitimate right to possession of the real properties for establishment of the Casino, [... ] and the right to encroachment of the necessary superstructures within the settlement where the activity subject to concession is exercised.\"527*\n\n**Exhibit C-l.**\n\n445.\n\nClaimant submits that the Concession Company had *\"lawfulpossession\"* and the *\"right to build,\"* which corresponds to the *\"right to encroachment,\"528* in accordance with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract.529 Claimant argues that, under Hungarian law, the owner of land is entitled to transfer possession of that land to another person and, in so doing, the person to whom possession is given is entitled to use that land. Further, as established by Hungarian court practice, the *\"right to build\u2019* is encompassed within the right to use the land.530\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 373.\n\nReply, \u00b6 265.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6258, 427.\n\n446.\n\nIn this case, Claimant notes that Respondent transferred possession of the Sukor\u00f3 Site to Mr. Blum through the Land Swap Agreement and thereby accepted that the land would be used by the new possessor, Mr. Blum, even prior to the registration of his ownership in the Land Registry.531 As a consequence, Claimant is of the view that the subsequent finding of invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement by the Hungarian courts has no bearing on Mr. Blum\u2019s *\"lawfulpossession\"* or his *\"right to build,\"* as it could not extinguish Respondent\u2019s *\"consensual transfer of possession of the lands, which isa legal transaction distinct from the Land Swap Agreement\"* under Hungarian law.532\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6259, 427.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 259-260; *cf.* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 279.\n\n447.\n\nClaimant submits that Mr. Blum\u2019s possession was *\"lawful\"* as it was based on Respondent\u2019s *\"unequivocal consent and authorisation,\"* which is reflected in the Registration Authorization and the Handover Protocol.533 Claimant refers to its expert Dr. Tausz, who stated in his expert opinion that *\"[i]n the Registration Authorisation, the Respondent consented to Mr. Blum exercising all the ownership rights over the Sukor\u00f3 Real Properties. [... ] This included the owner\u2019s consent to build, which [... ] is part of the owner\u2019s rights.\"534* Claimant further refers to Dr. Tausz\u2019s observation that the Handover Protocol reflected the *\"mutual, uniform intention of the parties to transfer possession of the* [Sukor\u00f3] *Properties from the Respondent to Mr. Blum\"* as well as Prof. Kisfaludi\u2019s statement that the Handover Protocol represented the *\"common will of the parties to carry out such a transfer,\"535*\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 260 *et seq.,* 428; *cf.* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, 280-281.\n\nReply, \u00b6 262; Tausz II, \u00b6 2.4.3.5.I.\n\nReply, \u00b6 263; Tausz II, \u00b6 2.4.24.3; Kisfaludi, \u00b6 12.\n\n448.\n\nClaimant submits that, subsequently, nothing prohibited Mr. Blum from transferring this *\"lawfulpossession\"* to KC Bidding, and then KC Bidding from assigning this right to the Concession Company.536\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 264, 429; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 281.\n\n449.\n\nClaimant further contends that Respondent made no effort to take back possession of the Sukor\u00f3 Site or otherwise demonstrate that it did not consider the Sukor\u00f3 Site to be available as a Project site, such as repayment of the sum that Mr. Blum had paid pursuant to the Land Swap Agreement.537\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 282.\n\n**(ii) Claimant Was Not Required to Establish the Concession Company Within the Administrative Territory of the Project Site as at 1 January 2011**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n450.\n\nClaimant secondly refers to Respondent\u2019s allegation that KC Bidding had failed to comply with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract because, after having established the Concession Company in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, KC Bidding was required in accordance with Clause 7.1.2 to certify a Project Site in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r rather than in Sukor\u00f3. Clause 7.1 of the Concession Contract provides, in relevant part:\n\n*\"[...] The Concession Company should meet the following requirements at the same time of establishing and throughout the concession period as well.*\n\n*7.1.2. The headquarters of the Concession Company shall be located within the territory of the settlement where the activity subject to concession is exercised?\u2019*\n\n451.\n\nClaimant submits that, as Respondent could not terminate the Concession Contract with immediate effect on the basis of Clause 7.1.2, it *\"employed a contrived and baseless interpretation of Clause 9.3 to do so by another route\"538* Claimant argues that, despite KC Bidding\u2019s having notified Respondent on 21 December 2010 that it had acquired lawful possession of the Sukor\u00f3 Site, Respondent *\"somehow\"* concluded from the fact that the headquarters of SDI Europe was *\"formally located\u2019* in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9r\u00e1r that KC Bidding had chosen Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r to be the settlement in which the concession activity would be exercised.539\n\nReply, \u00b6 473.\n\nReply, \u00b6 473; Memorial, \u00b6 287.\n\n452.\n\nClaimant contends that, according to Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the Concession Contract, KC Bidding would have been required to determine within 90 days of the signing of the Concession Contract *(i.e.,* the time limit for establishing the Concession Company) where the concession activity would be exercised. Conversely, it is Claimant\u2019s position that Clauses 7.1 and 4.2 required KC Bidding to locate the seat of the Concession Company at the place of the concession activity only once those activities had commenced.540\n\nReply, \u00b6 475.\n\n453.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s internal correspondence and that with KC Bidding throughout 2010 *\"reveals its lack of belief in this illogical interpretation of Clauses 7.1.2 and 9.3\"* because it shows that Respondent did not consider KC Bidding to be limited to Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r after SDI Europe was established there on 21 January 2010.541\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6476, 477.\n\n454.\n\nClaimant further asserts that Respondent, relying on Clause 7.1.2 alone, based the termination of the Concession Contract on the fact that the Concession Company was located in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r rather than in Sukor\u00f3. In response to Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the clause that the Concession Company *\"had to be located in the actual settlement chosen by KC Bidding from the list in Annex 1 of the Concession Contract,\"* Claimant relies on its expert Dr. Tausz who opined that Respondent\u2019s argument is based on Clause 7.1.2 *\"read in isolation, without regard to the Concession Contract as a whole,\"* which results in an *\"absurd\"* interpretation of the provision.542\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 268-269; Tausz II, \u00b6 2.2.2.5.\n\n455.\n\nClaimant argues that Clause 5 of the Concession Contract provides that the concession activity may be exercised within the administrative area of one of the 133 settlements contained in Annex 1, whereas Clause 9.3 requires the Concession Company to have *\"lawfulpossession\"* and the *\"right to build\"* for the real properties on 1 January 2011. As the final location of the concession activities did not have to be determined at the time that the Concession Company was established, the Concession Contract did not require the headquarters of the Concession Company to be established at Sukor\u00f3 rather than at Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, which was also one of the 133 potential settlements.543 Claimant refers to the statement of its expert Dr. Tausz that it would therefore be *\"nonsensical to apply the requirement of Clause 7.1.2 for the time of establishment of the Concession Company, at which point in time the location of the concession activity is not yet known.544*\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6270-271.\n\nReply, \u00b6 272; Tausz II, \u00b6 2.2.2.13.\n\n456.\n\nClaimant further asserts that Respondent ignores the wording of the preceding Clause 7.1, according to which *\"the following requirements* [should be met by the Concession Company] *at the same time of establishing and throughout the concession period as well?\u2019* Pursuant to Clause 4.2, the concession period shall start at the date on which the license for performing the concession activity is granted. Claimant contends that, as the concession period never started, KC Bidding was not obliged to move the seat of the Concession Company to the place where the concession activity would be exercised and thus the establishment at Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r did not constitute a breach of the Concession Contract.545\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 273-275; 431.\n\n457.\n\nIn any event, Claimant submits that such a breach would not justify termination of the Concession Contract with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.1. Claimant refers to the opinion of its expert Dr. Tausz that the list in Clause 15.2.1 is exhaustive and does not include the failure to establish the Concession Company within the territory of the settlement where the concession activity is to be exercised. Claimant further argues that the immediate termination of the Concession Contract *\"for an alleged failure to comply with a registration requirement, was grossly disproportionate\"* and refers to Dr. Tausz\u2019s statement that \"[i]t *would be highly unreasonable to frustrate an investment of this magnitude due to such an administrative formality,* [as] *moving the registered seat of a Hungarian company from one city to another is a very simple, formal procedure which can be accomplished within a few weeks\"546*\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 276-277; Tausz II, \u00b6 2.2.2.15.\n\n**(iii) The Suretyship Provided by Mr. Lauder Complied with the Terms of the Concession Contract**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n458.\n\nFinally, Claimant refers to Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Suretyship provided by Mr. Lauder did not comply with the terms of Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract. Clause 12.1 provides:\n\n*\"As security for any of its payment obligations arising from this Contract, the Concession Receiver shall ensure from January 1, 2010 for the full concession period without interruption a bank guarantee, security deposit or cash surety.\"*\n\n459.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Suretyship did not comply with the requirements because it was limited in time and in value, Claimant argues that this interpretation contradicts the plain language of the Concession Contract. Claimant submits that Clause 12.1 offers the concession receiver the choice of three types of acceptable security; however, Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the term *\"without interruption\"* in Clause 12.1 fails to take into account the terms of Clause 12 as a whole. Claimant refers to the use of the same term in Clause 12.2.2, pursuant to which *\"[t]he bank guarantee shall be provided without interruption, i.e. on an annual basis\"*\n\n460.\n\nClaimant is of the view that the meaning of the term *\"without interruption\"* provided in Clause 12.2.2 must apply with equal force to all three types of security.547 Claimant refers to its expert Prof. Kisfaludi who noted in his expert opinion that \"[i]t *would result in an insolvable contradiction to interpret section 12.1 of the Concession Contract as requiring an unlimited guarantee in terms of time and amount, when the next section on bank guarantee [... ] specifies both a time limit and minimum amount\"548*\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 286-288, 433.\n\nReply, \u00b6 288; Kisfaludi, \u00b6 39.\n\n461.\n\nClaimant argues that KC Bidding was entitled to change the type of security, provided that valid security was in place as of 1 January 2011. As Mr. Lauder\u2019s Suretyship only expired on 31 March 2011, it was still valid at the time of Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract.549\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6291, 434.\n\n462.\n\nWith regard to Respondent\u2019s argument that the limitation of the amount was an *\"unacceptable condition of the Surety,\"* Claimant contends that Respondent again fails to interpret Clause 12.1 in the context of Clause 12 as a whole and refers to Clause 12.2.3, according to which the amount of the bank guarantee shall equal the concession fee payable by the Concession Receiver for the given years. According to Claimant, this provision confirms that Clause 12.1 does not require any of the three types of security to be unlimited in amount.550\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6292-293.\n\n463.\n\nFinally, Claimant asserts that Respondent, on at least two occasions prior to the termination, positively assured Claimant of the validity of the Suretyship:551 On 9 December 2009, Mr. Arvai wrote in his letter to Dr. B\u00e1rd that *\"the suretyship is acceptable and no objections have been raised according to paragraph 12.4 of the concession agreement?\u2019552* By letter of 5 March 2010, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 also confirmed to KB Bidding that there were *\"no reservations regarding the implementation of the terms of this* [concession] *agreement?\u2019553* Claimant refers to Dr. Tausz\u2019s statement that on the basis of these letters, *\"it is reasonable to say that the State of Hungary, the creditor, accepted the Suretyship Declaration\"* and that the suretyship was thus valid under Hungarian law.554\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 480-481; Reply, \u00b6 435.\n\n**Exhibit C-206.**\n\n**Exhibit C-205.**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 480; Tausz I, \u00b6 5.3.3.3.\n\n464.\n\nClaimant argues that if even if the Suretyship was *\"not technically in compliance with the terms of the Concession Contract,\"* the two letters constitute either a waiver by Respondent of the exercise of its rights based on a breach of those terms or a modification of the Concession Contract itself.555 Claimant is of the view that, having accepted the validity of Mr. Lauder\u2019s Suretyship, Respondent was obliged under Hungarian law to act in good faith and to cooperate. Claimant refers to the expert opinion of Prof. Kisfaludi who stated that the obligation to cooperate *\"required the Respondent to notify the other party, KC Bidding Kft., of the breach and to give it sufficient time to rectify the breach\"556*\n\nReply, \u00b6 294, Kisfaludi, \u00b6 54.\n\nReply, \u00b6 296, Kisfaludi, \u00b6 57.\n\n**b) Respondent Is Not Entitled to Rely upon Grounds of Termination the Causes of Which Were its Own Failures**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nClaimant submits that, even if Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract were genuinely based on the purported reasons, as a corollary of the principle that *nul-lus commodum capere potest de sua injuria propria* (no man can take advantage of his own wrong), the fact that Respondent\u2019s own conduct gave rise to the existence of such purported reasons means that its reliance upon them cannot be in good faith.557\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 467.\n\n466.\n\nClaimant refers to the fact that (i) the MNV attacked the valuation of its own valuator Perfekting in arguing for the invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement; (ii) ITD Hungary relied on Respondent\u2019s own investigation of the Land Swap Agreement, which arose exclusively out of the dispute that had arisen between Respondent\u2019s Water Authority and Construction Authority, to justify its refusal to sign the incentive agreement; and\n\n(iii) Respondent concluded that KC Bidding did not hold *\"the legitimate right to possession of the real properties of establishment of the Casino [...] and the right to encroachment of the necessary superstructures within the settlement where the activity subject to* [the] *concession is exercised\"558* on the basis that Mr. Blum\u2019s legal title over the Sukor\u00f3 Site had not been registered. Claimant\u2019s expert witness Dr. Tausz describes this situation as having arisen out of the *\"gross incompetence by the collective State authorities\"* in connection with the Land Swap Agreement.559\n\nClause 9.3 of the Concession Contract. **Exhibit C-l.**\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 474; Tausz I, \u00b6 3.1.4.\n\n467.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent relied upon *\"its own multiple failures,\"560* namely the lack of registration and the failure of the tract formation procedure, to prevent KC Bidding from satisfying the requirements of the Concession Contract, and asserts that, as a matter of Hungarian law, this is not permissible under the principle *nemo suam turpitudinem allegans auditur561*\n\nReply, \u00b6 280.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 279-280.\n\n468.\n\nClaimant refers to the opinion of its expert Prof. Kisfaludi who opines:\n\n*\"Taking into consideration that the cause of the failure of the tract formation was the breach of law by the Respondent\u2019s own construction authority (as specified by the public prosecutor\u2019s protest), the Respondent\u2019s challenge to Mr. Blum\u2019s* \u2018right to build\u2019 *was clearly based upon its own failure. This is not acceptable in civil law relationships. Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code prohibits using one\u2019s own culpable acts as a basis for acquiring benefits.\"562*\n\nReply, \u00b6 280; Kisfaludi, \u00b6 64.\n\n469.\n\nClaimant further quotes Prof. Kisfaludi\u2019s statement that Respondent was not entitled to rely upon grounds for termination the causes of which were its own failures:\n\n*\"[E]ven if it is assumed that the absence of registration of Mr.* *Blum\u2019s ownership concerning the Sukor\u00f3 site had been in itself a good reason for termination of the Concession Contract (which it was not), the Respondent organs\u2019 own failures in the registration process deprived the Respondent from using the missing registration as a basis for termination of the Concession Contract.\"563*\n\nReply, \u00b6 281; Kisfaludi, \u00b6 71.\n\n470.\n\nClaimant finally refers to Prof. Kisfaludi\u2019s conclusion that, treating Respondent as a *\"single unit, embracing all the organs and organisations which were established and* *maintained by the Respondent,\"* Respondent cannot rely upon its own failures to justify the termination of the Concession Contract.564\n\nReply, \u00b6 282; Kisfaludi, \u00b6 72.\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Concession Contract Was Terminated in Accordance with its Terms and Hungarian Law**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n471.\n\nRespondent submits that it terminated the Concession Contract with immediate effect on the basis of three independent grounds, all of which constitute valid grounds for termination under Hungarian law.565\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 363.\n\n**(i) SDI Europe Did Not Have the Legitimate Right of Possession of and the Right to Build on the Sukor\u00f3 Site**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n472.\n\nRespondent first submits that KC Bidding failed to certify that SDI Europe had the *\"legitimate right of possession\"* and the *\"right of encroachment\"* as required under Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract.\n\n473.\n\nRespondent submits that Clause 15.2.1.1 provides that failure to secure a Proj ect site in accordance with Clause 9.3 entitles the State to terminate the Concession Contract with immediate effect.566\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 365.\n\n474.\n\nRespondent argues that the sequence of events that preceded KC Bidding\u2019s notification of the Ministry of National Economy that SDI Europe had allegedly acquired lawful possession of the Sukor\u00f3 Site demonstrates that possession of the land was established at the last minute in order to present the appearance of formal compliance with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract. Respondent argues that from October 2009 and throughout 2010, the Project Sponsors understood that they needed to secure an alternative site for the Project and made some effort to do so; however, KC Bidding failed to secure an alternative location.567 In this regard, Respondent refers to the following events:\n\n- On 20 December 2010, ten days before the deadline to secure a Project site, KC Bidding and SDI Europe concluded the Assignment Agreement which purported to transfer to SDI Europe KC Bidding\u2019s rights to the Leased Real Properties as defined in the Lease Agreement and, in particular, the *\"right of possession and the building (encroachment) rights\"568*\n\n- On 21 December 2010, KC Bidding and SDI Europe concluded a handover protocol, purporting to transfer possession of the Leased Real Properties to the Concession Company.569\n\n- On 21 December 2010, KC Bidding sought to certify to the Ministry of National Economy that SDI Europe had acquired lawful possession of, and the right to build on, the real properties at Sukor\u00f3, and that KC Bidding had accordingly complied with its contractual obligations under Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract.570\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 367.\n\n**Exhibit C-II.**\n\n**Exhibit R-104.**\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 367; Rejoinder, \u00b6 281; **Exhibit C-203.**\n\n475.\n\nRespondent refers to the witness statement of Dr. Roza Nagy, in which she explains that KC Bidding\u2019s letter of 21 December 2010 was reviewed by the Ministry of National Economy\u2019s external legal counsel who determined that SDI Europe could not have acquired legitimate possession of, or the right to build on, the Sukor\u00f3 Site, prompting the Ministry\u2019s decision to terminate the Concession Contract.571\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 281; Nagy, 1) 40.\n\n476.\n\nRespondent relies on the opinion of its expert Prof. Kir\u00e1ly who explains that the requirement of *\"legitimate possession\"* in the context of Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract is two-fold: (i) the Concession Contract must be in actual possession of the Project site, and (ii) this possession must be based on a valid legal title.572 Respondent claims that the chain of transfer of possession is fundamentally flawed because the first link in the chain is missing: Mr. Blum never held (and therefore could never have effectively transferred) a valid legal title to the Sukor\u00f3 Site.573\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 369; Kir\u00e1ly I, \u2018 6.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 370.\n\n477.\n\nRespondent argues that Mr. Blum could not have acquired valid legal title to the Sukor\u00f3 Site because that legal title derived from the Land Swap Agreement. This Agreement was, as now confirmed by the *Curia,* null and void *ab initio,* which, Respondent submits, means that no rights or obligations could derive from that contract.574\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 371, 286-303.\n\n478.\n\nRespondent argues that there was no consensual transfer of possession independent of the Land Swap Agreement. It refers to the expert opinion of Prof. Kir\u00e1ly that the handing over recorded in the Handover Protocol *\"took place on the basis of the Land Swap Agreement\"* and further that the Registration Authorization was issued in order to *\"carry out the Land Swap Agreement\"575*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 244; Kir\u00e1ly II, \u00b6\u00b6 16-25.\n\n479.\n\nRespondent further asserts that no consensual transfer of ownership took place, even if the Land Swap Agreement had been valid, because the Registration Authorization could not create ownership rights without the actual registration.576\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 245.\n\n480.\n\nAs regards the *\"right to encroachment,\"* Respondent again refers to Prof. Kir\u00e1ly, who explained that *\"this right corresponds to the right to build, which is held exclusively by the owner of the land, who alone may transfer this right to third parties\"577*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 373; Kir\u00e1ly I, \u00b6\u00b6 19-24.\n\n481.\n\nRespondent submits that it is incorrect for Claimant\u2019s expert Dr. Tausz to state that the rights relating to the Sukor\u00f3 Site granted pursuant to Section III.3 of the Land Swap Agreement include the right to build.578\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 374-375; Tausz 1,\u00b6 5.3.4.6.\n\n482.\n\nRespondent maintains that Mr. Blum never acquired a right of ownership. His alleged right to build therefore had to be otherwise transferred by the owner of the land. Furthermore, the Land Swap Agreement and the Handover Protocol did not grant Mr. Blum any right to build on the Sukor\u00f3 Site:579\n\n- Section III. 3 of the Land Swap Agreement did not transfer any right to build to Mr. Blum. Section III. 3 of the Land Swap Agreement provides: *\"Starting from the date of cession, the Parties shall be entitled to the rights and benefits related to the property - acquired on the basis of the present agreement - and they shall bear all burdens as well as the damage and loss risks related to the property\"580* First, the acquisition of any *\"rights related to the property\"* by Mr. Blum could have occurred only after the registration of his title, which never happened. More importantly, Mr. Blum could not and did not acquire any rights based on an agreement that is, as confirmed by the *Curia,* null and void.\n\n- In addition, the Handover Protocol did not transfer to Mr. Blum the State\u2019s right to build. As is plain from the language of the Handover Protocol, it did not purport to transfer a right to build but merely purported to transfer possession, which means the right to enjoy the property *\"as is\"*\n\n- In any event, Mr. Blum cannot rely on the Land Swap Agreement to assert any right to build because the Land Swap Agreement was declared null and void, thus rendering the Handover Protocol, which was concluded on the basis of the Land Swap Agreement, also null and void.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 375.\n\n**Exhibit C-41.**\n\n483.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent submits that Hungary considered the Land Swap Agreement to be null and void *ab initio* and asserts that it communicated such view to Mr. Blum as early as in November 2009.581\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 233.\n\n484.\n\nIn response to Claimant\u2019s submission that the Termination Letter does not refer to the absolute nullity of the Land Swap Agreement, Respondent submits that the nullity was one of the reasons underlying Respondent\u2019s position in the Termination Letter and that Hungarian law does not require that the justification of a termination ground be expressly stated upon termination, as long as the termination ground exists.582\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 235.\n\n485.\n\nRespondent further contends that, even if the Land Swap Agreement had been valid, the Registration Authorization in itself could not have created ownership rights in the absence of actual registration. Respondent submits that this was reflected in the drafting of the Termination Letter by way of reference to Article 97(2) of the Hungarian Civil Code.583\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 235.\n\n486.\n\nRespondent concludes that Mr. Blum never acquired the right to build on the Sukor\u00f3 Site and therefore, on 1 January 2011, SDI Europe did not have the right to build on that site as required by Clause 9.3.584 In Respondent\u2019s view, Claimant was fully aware that it had not secured the Sukor\u00f3 Site, as Mr. Langhammer confirmed during the Hearing that Claimant had asked for an extension in October 2010 because he knew that Claimant, *\"come 1 January 2011\"* would not otherwise *\"have possession of the site\"585*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 376.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 236; Transcript, p. 964, lines 8-16.\n\n487.\n\nRespondent submits that KC Bidding failed to secure a Project site in Sukor\u00f3 for reasons unrelated to Respondent and claims that the Project Sponsors were aware from the outset of the *\"likely unavailability\"* of the Sukor\u00f3 settlement.586\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 301.\n\n488.\n\nRespondent also refers to the fact that, during the negotiation of the Concession Contract, the Ministry of Finance agreed with KC Bidding that the Concession Contract should be amended so as to allow for the Project to be implemented in any one of 133 settlements in Central Transdanubia. The Sukor\u00f3 Site was initially the sole Project site, but both parties agreed that the site could be selected from any location within the 133 settlements listed in the Tender and in Annex 1 to the Concession Contract. Respondent stresses that the only mention of the Sukor\u00f3 Site in the Concession Contract is contained in Annex 1. Respondent submits that the evidence shows that the Concession Contract was signed on the mutual understanding that, due to the uncertainties surrounding the Land Swap Agreement, the Project would *\"likely not proceed in Sukor\u00f3.\"587*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 305.\n\n489.\n\nRespondent concludes that it did not procure the grounds for termination of the Concession Contract. Specifically, it did not interfere with KC Bidding\u2019s search for an alternative settlement. Respondent submits that, for reasons unknown to it, KC Bidding decided to resort to the Sukor\u00f3 Site, which KC Bidding knew was not available for the Project.588\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 321.\n\n**(ii) KC Bidding Failed to Establish the Concession Company within the Same Administrative Territory as the Project Site**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n490.\n\nSecondly, Respondent submits that KC Bidding was contractually bound under Clause 7.1.2 of the Concession Contract to establish the headquarters of the Concession Company *\"within the territory of the settlement where the activity subject to concession is exercised,\"* such obligation continuing *\"at the time of establishing and throughout the concession period as well\"589*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 378.\n\n491.\n\nRespondent submits that KC Bidding purported to certify legitimate possession of a Project site in Sukor\u00f3 even though the Concession Company, SDI Europe, had been and remained established in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r.590 Respondent emphasizes that, by locating its headquarters in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, the Concession Company had, on the basis of Clauses 7.1 and 7.1.2 of the Concession Contract, designated Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r as the settlement where the concession activity would be exercised.591 According to Respondent, KC Bidding thus failed to certify legitimate possession of a Project Site located within the same territory as the Concession Company *(i.e.,* at Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r), which entitled Respondent to terminate the Concession Contract pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.1.592\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 379.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 233.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 379.\n\n492.\n\nIn reference to Claimant\u2019s argument that the seat of the Concession Company could be located in any of the settlements listed in Annex 1 of the Concession Contract, Respondent maintains that Clause 7.1.2 requires that the Concession Company be located within the *\"same territory\"* as the Project site that KC Bidding had chosen from the list in Annex 1 of the Concession Contract.593\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 380.\n\n493.\n\nRespondent also refers to Claimant\u2019s argument that Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the Contract would have meant that KC Bidding was required to determine the location of the exercise of the activity subject to concession within 90 days of signature of the Concession Contract. Respondent contends that Claimant\u2019s understanding is wrong in this regard; KC Bidding could subsequently have chosen to locate the Project in another location, which would have required it to change the seat of the Concession Company.594 In Respondent\u2019s view, it was logical to consider that by locating and maintaining its headquarters in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, KC Bidding had designated Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r as the Project location.595\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6296-297.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 297.\n\n494.\n\nRespondent submits that KC Bidding\u2019s failure to establish the Concession Company *\"within the territory of the settlement where the activity subject to concession is exercised\"* justified the termination of the Concession Contract.596\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 381.\n\n495.\n\nRespondent recognizes that failing to establish the Concession Company within the same territory as the Project site is a formal ground for termination, and submits that it was included in the Termination Letter as a *\"matter of proper and cautious legal practice?\u2019* Respondent further submits that the Concession Company could have transferred its headquarters to Sukor\u00f3, but it failed to do so.597\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 229.\n\n**(iii) The Suretyship Provided by Mr. Lauder Did Not Comply with the Terms of the Concession Contract**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that KC Bidding was contractually bound under Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract to provide financial security on an annual basis throughout the concession period to guarantee any of its payment obligations under the Concession Contract. Respondent relies on its expert Prof. Kir\u00e1ly\u2019s confirmation that any security provided under Clause 12.1 must be *\"unlimited in its amount, i.e., covers each and any payment obligation of the Concessionaire that may arise from the Concession Contract during the concession\u2019\u2019* and *\"uninterrupted\"* throughout the concession period.598\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 382; Kir\u00e1ly I, \u00b6\u00b6 72-87.\n\n497.\n\nRespondent submits that the Suretyship provided by Mr. Lauder on behalf of KC Bidding was limited in time and in value: It was valid until 31 March 2011 and capped at HUF 936 Million. Respondent submits that it was therefore entitled to terminate the Concession Contract with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.22.599\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 384.\n\n498.\n\nRespondent observes that Claimant does not explicitly deny that Mr. Lauder\u2019s Suretyship did not comply with the requirements under Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract. Rather, Claimant asserts that *\"Respondent twice positively assured Claimant of the validity of Mr. Lauder\u2019s suretyship,\u2019\u2019 i.e.,* in the letters of Mr. Arvai and Dr. Oszk\u00f3 dated 9 December 2009 and 5 March 2010, respectively, and was therefore precluded from referring to KC Bidding\u2019s violation of Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract as a ground for termination. Respondent contends that these letters provide no such as- surance.600\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 385.\n\n499.\n\nIn his letter dated 9 December 2009, Mr. Arvai confirmed that *\"no objection has been raised with respect to the*  *identity of the guarantor* *\u2019\u2019* and that the suretyship therefore *\"meets the requirements*  *under paragraph 12.4* *of the Concession Contract'\u2019601* Respondent argues that Claimant\u2019s translation of this letter is inaccurate: Mr. Arvai did not confirm that *\"the suretyship was acceptable\u2019\u2019;* he simply confirmed that Mr. Lauder was an acceptable guarantor within the meaning of Clause 12.4 of the Concession Contract, without commenting on the validity of the Suretyship in view of the requirements of Clause 12.1 concerning the term and the value of the Suretyship.602 Respondent submits that the identity of the guarantor is unrelated to the basis for termination articulated in the Termination Letter (that the Suretyship provided by Mr. Lauder was limited in time and in value).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 386 (emphasis in Respondent\u2019s quotation of the original); **Exhibit R-79.**\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 386.\n\n500.\n\nLikewise, Respondent submits that Claimant\u2019s translation of Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter of 5 March 2010 is inaccurate; Dr. Oszk\u00f3 confirmed that \"[n]o *objections have been raised with regard to the performance of these contractual obligations as yet.\"603* Respondent maintains that this letter does not address the compliance of the Suretyship with the relevant requirements under Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract, but rather the contractual obligations specifically referred to in Mr. Benkley\u2019s letter, including the obligations under Clause 12.4 of the Concession Contract concerning the identity of the guarantor. Respondent submits that it therefore cannot be understood as a broad assurance as to the validity of the Suretyship.604\n\n**Exhibit R-82**\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 387.\n\n501.\n\nRespondent submits that for these reasons, the three grounds for termination invoked in Hungary\u2019s Termination Letter are valid under the terms of the Concession Contract and Hungarian law and therefore justify the termination of the Concession Contract.605\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 389.\n\n502.\n\nRespondent refers to Claimant\u2019s argument that, even if the termination were lawful under Hungarian law, Hungary failed to give KC Bidding advance notice of its intention to terminate and provide an opportunity to cure any alleged breaches, or to otherwise agree to KC Bidding\u2019s request for an extension of the deadline under Clause 9.3.606 Respondent submits that nothing in the Concession Contract or under Hungarian law imposes on the State the obligation to give the investor advance notice of any termination.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 390.\n\n**b) Respondent Was Not Precluded From Relying on the Fact that Mr. Blum Was Not Registered as the Owner of the Leased Real Properties**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nWith regard to Claimant\u2019s argument that the *nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem al-legans* principle prevents Respondent from relying on the lack of registration as a termination ground, Respondent submits that Claimant has not considered the conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the *nemo auditur* principle to apply to the current case, namely that a party has to rely on its own culpable act with the aim of obtaining advantages.607\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 249.\n\n504.\n\nRespondent refers to the opinion of its expert Prof. Varga who explains that, under Hungarian law, the crucial element to be determined is whether the act committed qualifies as a *\"culpable act\";*\n\n*\"At the heart of the* nemo auditor *principle, however, lies the notion of a culpable act, including one\u2019s omissions, breaches of contract, late performance, criminal acts etc. All these actions have in common that they do not meet the requirement established in the first sentence of Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code that is*  *they cannot be considered reasonable or to be as it can be expected under the given circumstances* *.\"608*\n\nRejoinder, 250 (emphasis in Respondent\u2019s quotation of the original); Varga II, \u00b6 13.\n\n505.\n\nRespondent cites Prof. Varga\u2019s statement that *\"Respondent is not precluded from relying on the fact that Mr. Blum did not meet the requirement to have legitimate possession of and the right to build on the Sukor\u00f3 plots,\"* notably because Respondent\u2019s conduct in the tract formation process does not qualify as culpable conduct within the meaning of Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code.609 Respondent refers to Prof. Varga\u2019s reasoning in this regard:\n\n*\"According to established case-law developed in connection with damages claims initiated against public authorities, only a flagrantly*  *flawed interpretation and application* *of the laws in force can amount to the qualification of a culpable act.\"610*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 251; Varga II, \u00b6 15.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 251 (emphasis in Respondent\u2019s quotation of the original); Varga II, \u00b6 20.\n\n506.\n\nRespondent concludes that the tract formation process *\"involved highly complicated matters of Hungarian land law\";* therefore, Respondent\u2019s conduct cannot be qualified as culpable, which renders the *nemo auditur* principle inapplicable.611\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 252.\n\n507.\n\nRespondent submits that, in any event, the need for the tract formation procedure derived from the Land Swap Agreement and as the *Curia* confirmed that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void *ab initio,* any issue arising out of the tract formation procedure is moot.612\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 431.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**a) Preliminary Observations**\n-------------------------------\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal makes the following preliminary observations: First, a lawsuit is pending before the Hungarian courts regarding the legality of Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract.613 To the Tribunal\u2019s knowledge, no decision has yet been rendered. Second, the validity of the Land Swap Agreement was similarly the subject of court proceedings in Hungary, which resulted in a final decision of the *Curia,* rendered on 13 November 2012, holding that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void.614\n\nReply, \u00b6 117; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 284; **Exhibit R-121;** Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 240.\n\n**Exhibit R-131**\n\n509.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties that, while the decision of the **Curia** has *res judicata* effect as a matter of Hungarian law, it does not have such effect on the international plane and does not bind this Tribunal.615 Accordingly, the Tribunal will, in its own right, decide the issues in light of the evidence before it, giving due consideration to the **Curia** decision as evidence of Hungarian law.\n\nReply, \u00b6 454; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 240-241.\n\n510.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in its Reply, Claimant took the view that the *\"the Curia decision [...] cannot be viewed as credible\"616* First, Claimant submitted that one of the five judges who sat on the panel during the hearing on 13 November 2012 had only been appointed to the case the previous day and therefore had not had an opportunity to examine the file.617 Second, in Claimant\u2019s view, the **Curia** based its decision on reasons that *\"had never been addressed by the parties throughout the life of the proceeding,* [and] *Mr. Blum was accorded no opportunity to submit his views or submissions on them\"* According to Claimant, the *Curia\u2019s* decision therefore *\"violate[\u00e1] basic norms of due process and equality of arms at international law.\"618* In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant maintains its position that the **Curia** determined the invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement *\"on the basis of entirely different reasons,\"619* but Claimant no longer refers to the replacement judge; it also no longer draws the conclusion that the **Curia\u2019s** decision is thus flawed. The Tribunal notes that none of these issues were raised by Claimant during the Hearing. In the written pleadings, they have never been a primary argument or focus of Claimant\u2019s contentions. In fact, the Tribunal cannot address these issues in any detail because they received only conclusory treatment and scant attention from the Parties. In any event, they have not been adequately evidenced to credit them. The Tribunal also notes that the main basis for the **Curia\u2019s** decision, *i.e.,* that the development of the M4 motorway required the acquisition of only a small part of the land that was swapped for the Sukor\u00f3 land, had already been raised as an argument in the first instance, as evidenced by the discussion of this issue in the decision of the Fej\u00e9r County Court.620 Under these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot find any procedural unfairness in the conduct of the legal proceedings before the Hungarian courts.\n\nReply, \u00b6 350.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 335, 336.\n\nReply, \u00b6 349.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 277.\n\n**Exhibit R-127**, \u00b6\u00b6 **553** *et seq.*\n\n**b) The Termination Grounds Invoked by Respondent**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nIn its Termination Letter, Respondent states that it terminated the Concession Contract with immediate effect pursuant to the provisions of Clause 15.2.1, and specifically based on Clauses 15.2.1.1 and 15.2.1.22. Respondent listed three termination grounds.\n\n512.\n\nFirst, Respondent stated that, pursuant to Clause 7.1.2 of the Concession Contract, the headquarters of the Concession Company was required to be located where the concession activity would be exercised. As SDI Europe had its seat in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r at the time that the contractual deadline for acquiring both the legitimate right to possession and the right to build expired, Claimant would have needed to secure a Project site at Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, not at Sukor\u00f3, in order to comply with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract.\n\n513.\n\nSecond, Respondent stated that, even if Claimant had designated Sukor\u00f3 as the location for the concession activity to be exercised, Clause 9.3 was not complied with because Claimant had not acquired the legitimate right to possession of, and the right to build on, the Leased Real Properties. Respondent based that conclusion on the fact that, according to the deeds of ownership, the owner of the Sukor\u00f3 Site was the Hungarian State and not Mr. Blum; accordingly, Mr. Blum could not have entered into a valid agreement to share ownership with KC Bidding and, in turn, KC Bidding could not have concluded a valid agreement capable of transferring legitimate ownership and building rights with regard to the Leased Real Properties to SDI Europe.\n\n514.\n\nThird, Respondent based the termination of the Concession Contract on the ground that the Suretyship provided by Mr. Lauder did not comply with Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract because it was not sufficient in time and value.\n\n515.\n\nDuring the proceedings it became clear to the Tribunal that the second ground constitutes Respondent\u2019s main ground for terminating the Concession Contract, whereas the other two grounds may be considered additional, more formalistic grounds.621 The Tribunal will first address these two additional grounds before turning to its analysis of the main termination ground.\n\nAs regards the first termination ground, Respondent concedes in its Reply that Hungary terminated the Concession Contract based on the *\"admittedly formal\"* ground that Claimant had not certified the legitimate right of possession and the right to build in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. Reply, \u00b6 237. During its Opening Statement at the Hearing, Respondent also refers to this termination ground as *\"a formal matter.\"* Transcript, p. 338, line 18. In its Closing Statement, Respondent calls it a *\"technical ground,\"* but at the same time emphasizes that it is *\"a very serious and legally accurate ground for termination of the Concession Contract.\"* Transcript, p. 2964, lines 5-11. In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent again refers to this termination ground as a *\"formal ground [...] which was included in the Termination Letter as a matter of proper and cautious legal practice.\"* Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 229.\n\n**(i) Respondent\u2019s First Termination Ground: SDI Europe Did Not Have Legitimate Possession of, and the Right to Build on, a Site in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nRespondent reasoned in its Termination Letter that, as the Concession Company had been established in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, Claimant must have designated Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r as the settlement where the concession activity was to be exercised. As Claimant ultimately, in its letter of 21 December 2010, designated a location as the Project site that was not based in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, Respondent submits that Claimant failed to comply with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract. The Tribunal notes that Respondent did not argue in the Termination Letter that Claimant failed to establish the Concession Company within the same territory as the designated Project site, *i.e.,* at Sukor\u00f3, which would have qualified as a breach of Clause 7.1.2 only, but rather that Claimant, by locating the headquarters of SDI Europe at Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, designated Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r as the location of the Project site and therefore did not comply with Clauses 9.3 and 7.1.2, since it did not acquire a site in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r.\n\n517.\n\nWhile recognizing that the headquarters of SDI Europe was indeed located at Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and not at Sukor\u00f3 both when the deadline set out in Clause 9.3 expired on 1 January 2011 and when the Concession Contract was terminated on 10 January 2011, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent\u2019s reasoning in its Termination Letter that this necessarily leads to the conclusion that Claimant had designated Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r as the location for its Project. On the contrary, Claimant, in its letter to Respondent of 21 December 2010, clearly stated that the Leased Real Properties at Sukor\u00f3 were to be the location for the *\"establishment of the Casino and for exercising of the activity defined therein?\u2019622* The Tribunal therefore concludes that Claimant did not breach Clause 9.3 in connection with Clause 7.1.2 of the Concession Contract by establishing the Concession Company at Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r and then certifying a Project site that was not located at Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r.\n\n**Exhibit C-203.**\n\n518.\n\nThere nevertheless remains the fact that SDI Europe did not have its headquarters within the same territory as the designated Project site, *i.e.,* at Sukor\u00f3. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to analyze whether this qualifies as a breach of Clause 7.1.2 of the Concession Contract because, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, even if that were the case, this breach would not constitute a ground for terminating the Concession Contract with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1. The failure to establish the Concession Company within the same territory as the certified Project site does not qualify as a breach of Clause 9.3 in conjunction with Clause 7.1.2, but as a breach of Clause 7.1.2 only. However, such breach is not included within the grounds for termination listed in Clause 15.2.1, which has been invoked by Respondent in its Termination Letter. Thus, the Contract itself does not provide for termination on this basis.\n\n519.\n\nIn addition, Respondent does not contest that Claimant would have been able to change the headquarters of the Concession Company to Sukor\u00f3 easily and within a relatively short period of time. Although Respondent may not have been expressly obliged to give Claimant the opportunity to remedy any contractual breach before exercising its termination right, the Tribunal is of the view that it was unreasonable for Respondent to terminate the Concession Contract relating to such a major Project without notice and an opportunity to remedy the breach, for what is - in the Tribunal\u2019s view and as acknowledged by Respondent623 - an administrative formality. The Tribunal therefore finds that the fact that the Concession Company did not have its seat in Sukor\u00f3 did not justify, in itself, the immediate termination of the Concession Contract.\n\n*See* footnote 621.\n\n**(ii) Respondent\u2019s Third Termination Ground: Mr. Lauder\u2019s Suretyship Was Limited in Time and Value**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n520.\n\nWith regard to the Suretyship that Mr. Lauder provided to Respondent, the Tribunal notes that the Suretyship is dated 12 November 2009, which means that Respondent was aware of its content for more than a year before it terminated the Concession Contract. The record does not show that, during this time period, Respondent ever voiced any objections regarding the limited time or value of the Suretyship vis-\u00e0-vis the Project Sponsors.\n\n521.\n\nRespondent replied to Claimant\u2019s submission of the form of the Suretyship on two occasions, once by letter from Mr. Arvai dated 9 December 2009 and again by letter from Dr. Oszk\u00f3 dated 5 March 2010. The Parties have submitted different English translations of these letters. With regard to Mr. Arvai\u2019s letter, Claimant\u2019s translation reads in its relevant part as follows:\n\n*\"[T]he suretyship is acceptable and no objections have been raised according to paragraph 12.4 of the concession agreement\"624*\n\nRespondent\u2019s translation, on the other hand, reads:\n\n*\"[T]he suretyship meets the requirements under paragraph 12.4 of the concession agreement [...], no objection has been raised with respect to the identity of the guarantor,\"625*\n\nWhereas, in the wording of Respondent\u2019s translation, Mr. Arvai\u2019s assurance appears to be limited to the acceptance of Mr. Lauder as the person providing the Suretyship, Claimant\u2019s translation contains no such limitation, but rather indicates a broad assurance that the Suretyship was accepted by the Hungarian State without reservation.\n\n**Exhibit C-206.**\n\n**Exhibit R-79.**\n\n522.\n\nDr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter of 5 March 2010 was written in response to Mr. Benkley\u2019s letter dated 25 January 2010, in which Mr. Benkley stated that KC Bidding had performed all of its obligations stipulated under the Concession Contract including, *inter alia,* the submission of the Suretyship. He requested that the Minister confirm the performance of the obligations. According to Claimant\u2019s translation of the letter, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 replied:\n\n*\"There are no reservations regarding the implementation of the terms of this agreement\"626*\n\nRespondent\u2019s translation of the same part reads:\n\n*\"No objections have been raised with regard to the performance of these contractual obligations as yet\"627*\n\nEven though the wording of Respondent\u2019s translation might suggest that Dr. Oszk\u00f3 reserved the right to object to Claimant\u2019s performance in the future *(\"no objections [...] as yet\"),* Respondent has not provided any evidence that any objections were ever raised in relation to the Suretyship prior to the Termination Letter.\n\n**Exhibit C-205.**\n\n**Exhibit R-82.**\n\n523.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore is not required to decide which one of the translations it considers to be more accurate. Both translations of Mr. Arvai\u2019s letter of 9 December 2009 show that Respondent was aware of the content of the Suretyship before it was to become effective on 1 January 2010 and did not raise any objections to the limitations in time and value set out in the Suretyship. Further, even if Respondent\u2019s translation of Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter of 5 March 2010 were the correct version, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent would have been under an obligation to inform Claimant, prior to the termination of the Concession Contract, that it had changed its position and no longer considered the Suretyship to be in compliance with Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract. Nothing in the record indicates that Respondent ever did so.\n\n524.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that the purported non-compliance of the Suretyship with the provisions of Clause 12.1 of the Concession Contract did not justify, in itself, the immediate termination of the Concession Contract pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.22.\n\n**(iii) Respondent\u2019s Second Termination Ground: SDI Europe Did Not Have Legitimate Possession of, and the Right to Build on, the Leased Real Properties at Sukor\u00f3**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nAs stated above, the Tribunal considers that Respondent\u2019s main ground for terminating the Concession Contract was Claimant\u2019s purported failure to comply with Clause 9.3 by not acquiring legitimate possession of, and the right to build on, the Leased Real Properties, which Claimant had designated as the Project site on 21 December 2010.\n\n526.\n\nThe relevant part of the Termination Letter reads as follows:\n\n*\"The Hungarian State hereby terminates the Concession Contract as of today\u2019s date effective immediately pursuant to the provisions of Clause 15.2.1 and based on Clauses 15.2.1.1 and 15.2.1.22 of the Concession Contract as independent grounds for termination.*\n\n[...]\n\n*We note that even if the Concession Receiver had designated Sukor\u00f3 instead of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r as the location for exercising the concession activity, the documents enclosed by the Concession Receiver did not meet the requirements set out in the contract. Based on the attached title deeds (Appendix 2), it can be established that on 20 December 2010 - as well as currently - the owner of the properties registered in the outskirts of Sukor\u00f3 under topographical lot numbers 022/7, 022/8, 022/9 and 022/10 was, and still is, the Hungarian State and not Joav Blum.*\n\n*According to Section 97(2) of the Civil Code, the owner of the relevant land is the sole person who may enter into a valid agreement pertaining to share ownership - granting the ownership of the superstructures to a person different from the owner of the land - thus the null and void contract between KC Bidding Kft. and SDI Europe Kft. is not suitable for supporting the lawful possession and the \"right to encroach\" of the Concession Company with regard to the Sukor\u00f3 real properties.\"628*\n\nEnglish translation submitted by Respondent as **Exhibit R-lll.** The translation submitted by Claimant as **Exhibit C-202** differs in its wording, but not in substance. The same part reads:  \n*\"The Hungarian State hereby terminates the Concession Contract as of today\u2019s date effective immediately pursuant to the provisions of Item 15.2.1 and based on Items 15.2.1.1 and 15.2.1.22 of the Concession Contract as independent grounds for termination.*  \n [...]  \n*We hereby inform you that even in the event that the Concession Receiver had specified Sukor\u00f3 instead of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r as the location for practicing the relevant activity, the documents enclosed by the Concession Receiver would not be considered as proper fulfillment of the contract. As it can be established from the enclosed deed of ownership (Annex 2), the owner of the real properties under Lot Numbers 022/7,* *022/8, 022/9 and 022/10 at the outskirts of Sukor\u00f3 as of December 20, 2010 - and even at present - is the Hungarian State and not Mr. Yoav Blum.*  \n*The owner of the relevant land is the sole person who may enter into a valid agreement pertaining to share ownership - granting the ownership of the built structures to a person different from the owner of the land - pursuant to Article 97(2) of the Civil Code, thus the null and void contract between KC Bidding Ltd. and SDI Europe Ltd. is not suitable for supporting the legitimate ownership and \"building rights\" of the Concession Company with regard to the Sukor\u00f3 real properties.\"*\n\n527.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent did not expressly mention the nullity of the Land Swap Agreement as the basis for the termination in its letter. However, it is clear that Respondent implicitly relied on this basis by reference both to Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract and to the nullity of the Assignment Agreement between KC Bidding and SDI Europe, which could only derive from the nullity of the Land Swap Agreement.\n\n528.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that, even though the Land Swap Agreement had not been declared null and void by the **Curia** at the time of termination, the **Curia** later decided that it was null and void, meaning that, according to the *Curia\u2019s* findings, the Land Swap Agreement was already a nullity when Respondent terminated the Concession Contract.\n\n529.\n\nBefore considering the reasoning of the *Curia\u2019s* decision, the Tribunal will review the actual status of the real properties in Sukor\u00f3 as of the date for compliance with Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract, *i.e.,* 1 January 2011.\n\n- On 30 July 2008, Mr. Blum and the MNV concluded the Land Swap Agreement, relating to the Sukor\u00f3 Site. As noted above, the Land Swap Agreement was later declared null and void by the *Curia* in its decision of 13 November 2012.\n\n- On 12 December 2008, the MNV issued the Registration Authorization, which provided the MNV\u2019s consent to the registration of Mr. Blum\u2019s ownership rights over the 20 properties at Sukor\u00f3 that were to be swapped pursuant to the Land Swap Agreement.\n\n- On 12 February 2009, the MNV and Mr. Blum signed the Handover Protocol, in which the MNV transferred to Mr. Blum possession of the 16 properties that were not affected by the tract formation procedure, among them the four properties serving as the location for the Project (the Leased Real Properties).\n\n- On 8 May 2009, Mr. Blum and KC Bidding entered into the Lease Agreement, which granted KC Bidding a 24-year lease over the four Leased Real Properties on which KC Bidding planned to realize the Project.\n\n- On 13 May 2009, the MNV issued a declaration confirming that Mr. Blum had paid the value difference between the exchanged properties and fulfilled his other obligations arising out of the Land Swap Agreement, and that the properties not affected by the tract formation procedure had been transferred to the possession of Mr. Blum.\n\n- On 12 October 2009, Mr. Blum transferred possession of the four Leased Real Properties to KC Bidding.\n\n- On 20 December 2010, KC Bidding and the Concession Company, SDI Europe, entered into the Assignment Agreement, by which KC Bidding assigned possession and the right to build on the Leased Real Properties to SDI Europe, the Concession Company.\n\n- On 21 December 2010, KC Bidding and SDI Europe signed a handover protocol, by which KC Bidding transferred possession of the Leased Real Properties to SDI Europe.\n\n530.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes from the foregoing that Mr. Blum acquired possession of the 16 Sukor\u00f3 properties that were not affected by the tract formation procedure on 12 February 2009 and, with regard to the four Leased Real Properties, transferred such possession to KC Bidding and ultimately SDI Europe, respectively, on 12 October 2009 and 21 December 2010. Consequently, while the Concession Company thus acquired physical possession of the Leased Real Properties, the question that remains to be answered is whether this possession was *\"legitimate\"* and whether it encompassed the *\"right to encroachment,\"* as required under Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract.\n\n531.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Claimant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s experts congruently stated that *\"legitimate\"* possession requires that such possession is *\"based on a valid legal title\";629* the necessity of a valid legal title can thus be considered as common ground between the Parties.630\n\nTausz I, \u00b6 5.3.1.4; Kir\u00e1ly I, \u00b6 6.\n\n*Cf.* Memorial, \u00b6 508; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 369.\n\n532.\n\nIn the Termination Letter, Respondent relied on the undisputed fact that Hungary, and not Mr. Blum, was the registered owner of the Sukor\u00f3 Site and concluded therefrom that Mr. Blum was therefore not in a position to transfer any rights regarding the Leased Real Properties to KC Bidding or SDI Europe. However, the fact that Mr. Blum was never registered as the owner, is not dispositive of the question whether he could transfer *\"legitimate\"* possession to KC Bidding because even Respondent\u2019s legal experts stated in the course of these proceedings that there are other forms of legal titles for possession. In particular, Prof. Varga acknowledges that *\"a sale and purchase contract can [...] serve as a proper legal title for the possession of the thing to be transferred, if it is existent, valid and effective\"631*\n\nVarga I, \u00b6 28.\n\n533.\n\nWhile the Registration Authorization and the Handover Protocol clearly reflect the Parties\u2019 intention consensually to transfer possession of the properties to Mr. Blum, they cannot serve as legal title, as neither of them constitutes a contract in itself. The Registration Authorization only contains the MNV\u2019s unilateral declaration that Mr. Blum, having fulfilled his payment obligation, may be registered in the Land Registry, and the Handover Protocol only records the transfer of possession.\n\n534.\n\nThe only contract that may potentially serve as a legal title giving rise to a legitimate right of possession is the Land Swap Agreement. As stated above, the *Curia,* in its decision of 13 November 2012, which is final under Hungarian law, declared the Land Swap Agreement null and void. The decision reads in its relevant part:632\n\n*\"Therefore, when examining whether the legal condition is satisfied, it cannot be ignored what proportion of the property is actually needed to implement the construction, and what avenues are open for the Plaintiff to obtain them.*\n\n*In this case, out of the approximately 182.89 hectare territory of the three properties offered by the Respondent, the road construction affected a negligible portion, approximately 10.31 hectare, which is 5-6% of the entire territory. The value of the territory necessary for the construction, even if calculated at the - unacceptable - price established in the Land Swap Agreement, is only around HUF 45,000,000 out of the total value of HUF 1,084,010.100. Therefore, even based on the Land Swap Agreement, more than HUF 1,000,000,000 worth of property is transferred beyond the area necessary for the infrastructure development, which is severely and indefensibly disproportionate. When considering the properties\u2019 real market value based on the expert opinion, then this difference significantly exceeds HUF 1,500,000.000. It is unreasonable that the Plaintiff swaps 1/3 of the Lake Velence\u2019s North shore, one of the country\u2019s most outstanding vocational and natural area, for a much less valuable and not particularly well-situated territory, or rather for the necessary fraction of it. There was no reason either, why the Hungarian State needed to obtain several hectares of orchard and an out of use premises, including a shed and a water tower, for the purposes of a road construction.*\n\n*NIF Zrt. - as it had informed the Plaintiff\u2019s representative prior to the conclusion of the agreement - could have obtained the area necessary for the construction by offering a price of HUF 300-400/m2, or, in case of any obstacles, it could have expropriated it. According to Section 6 (3) and (4) of Act CXXIII of 2007 on Expropriation, it would not have been necessary to appropriate the properties in their entirety, but it is also a fact that - as the appellate court correctly established - with respect to the arable lands, the Plaintiff could also have exercised its preemption right for a fraction of the purchase price indicated in the agreement. Consequently, the possibility was open for the Plaintiff to lawfully obtain the portion of the territory which was in fact necessary for the construction; however, the conclusion of a land swap at this scale, with this content, for this alleged purpose, exceeds the limits of acceptability. On this basis, it can be established that the condition set forth in Section 13 (4) of the National Land Fund Act was not satisfied, the swap was neither necessary nor expedient or reasonable for the purposes of the linear infrastructure development, therefore the Land Swap Agreement was unlawful. Due to the unlawfulness of the Land Swap Agreement, it is null and void in accordance with Section 200 (2) of the Civil Code. Had the Land Swap Agreement been accepted as lawful, the statutory provision would fail to fulfill its social function of protecting state property, which also serves the interests of public and other investors, since it would make it possible, through the insertion of a swap element, which is irrelevant compared to the entire value of the agreement, to avoid public tendering or auction, which are assuring the guarantees of the rule of law.*\n\n*The fact alone that one of the parties - or in this case the previous representative of the Plaintiff - insists that the land swap was aimed at serving a public interest, does not make the issue indisputable. The National Asset Management Council does not create law; that body, as well as the parties of this lawsuit, is bound by the law; therefore the lawfulness of the contract concluded by them or approved by the body\u2019s decision is open to judicial review.*\n\n*It is an erroneous position that an unlawful contract may only be deemed null and void if the law itself ties this legal consequence to the breach of law. This interpretation would mean that breaching mandatory provisions of the law would remain without legal consequence. Section 200 (2) of the Civil Code is a general rule, which allows for the establishment of the invalidity of a contract even if it is in conflict with a provision regulating civil legal relationship, which fundamentally affects the procedure in connection with the creation of the legal relationship, the rights of representation, the contents of the contractor other significant circumstances, but does not specifically attach this legal consequence to the breach (BH2012.220).*\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s argument, according to which violating the rules of tendering may indeed result in the nullity of the contract only if the law specifically prescribes this legal consequence, is correct. However, in this case the conflict with the law was constituted by the lack of tendering or auction, whereas, according to the law, the transfer of the ownership of properties could not have occurred without them.*\n\n*Since the unlawfulness of the Land Swap Agreement could be determined, the Curia did not examine the merits of other reasons of invalidity and, in based on Section 275 (3) of the Code on Civil Procedure, with the modified reasons explained herein, upheld the judgment in effect.\"*\n\n**Exhibit R-131,** pp. 22-23.\n\n535.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the ****Curia\u2019s**** reasoning and has come to the conclusion that, contrary to Claimant\u2019s view,633 it is *\"credible\u2019\u2019* and persuasive under the circumstances. In particular, the Tribunal refers to the ****Curia\u2019s**** observation that the development of the M4 motorway affected only a *\"negligible portion?\u2019 i.e.,* 5-6%, of the Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land, which Mr. Blum offered in exchange for the Sukor\u00f3 Site. There is no basis in the record to disagree with the **Curia** when it concluded that it was not necessary to *\"appropriate\u2019\u2019* the Albertirsa Land and the Pilis Land in their entirety in order to build the motorway. Therefore, the land swap was not necessary for the State, and the public interest requirement in Section 13(4) of the National Land Fund Act was not satisfied. As a consequence, the **Curia** held that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void in accordance with Section 200(2) of the Hungarian Civil Code. The Tribunal does not perceive any reason to disagree with the ****Curia\u2019s**** findings and will therefore treat the Land Swap Agreement as null and void in line with the ****Curia\u2019s**** decision.\n\n*Cf.* Reply, \u00b6 350.\n\n536.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 experts have divergent views as to the impact of the nullity of the Land Swap Agreement on the right of possession. According to Claimant\u2019s expert Dr. Tausz:\n\n*\"Mr. Yoav Blum could consider the Land Swap Agreement valid irrespective of the Hungarian State\u2019s view to the contrary. The Hungarian State\u2019s declaration, proclaimed in the statement of claim filed with the Fej\u00e9r County Court on 19 November 2009 that the Land Swap Agreement is invalid only created a pending situation concerning the validity of the Land Swap Agreement. Consequently, until the standpoint of the Hungarian State was substantiated by a final and binding court decision, Mr. Yoav Blum could not be required to consider the Land Swap Agreement invalid.*\n\n*Thus, until the issuance of such a final and binding court decision,* *Mr. Yoav Blum had the right to claim the performance of the Land Swap Agreement from the Hungarian State, and could consider the Sukor\u00f3 Real Properties his own.\u2019\u2019634*\n\nTausz I, \u00b6\u00b6 4.6.1, 4.6.2.\n\n537.\n\nIn response to this statement, Respondent\u2019s expert Prof. Varga stated that:\n\n*\"Hungarian law differentiates between two kinds of invalidity: nullity (in Hungarian'.* \u2018s\u00e9mmiss\u00e9g\u2019) *and voidability (in Hungarian:* \u2018megt\u00e1madhat\u00f3s\u00e1g\u2019) *Whereas nullity is absolute and unconditional,* *voidability is conditional. The reason why nullity is considered unconditional is that nullity of a contract occurs by force of the law ('* ipso iure\u2019/ *and the establishment of the contract\u2019s nullity does not require a court proceeding or any other proceeding. Furthermore, as also stated in Section 234(1) of the Hungarian Civil Code, every person can refer to the fact that the contract is null and void without any time limits. In contrast to this, the invalidity of a voidable contract is conditional because - as also stated in Section 235(1) of the Hungarian Civil Code - the contract will only be invalid in case a person entitled to avoid the contract avoids it within the time set by law. In this case the contract will become invalid* ex tunc *that is retrospectively to the time of its conclusion.*\n\n*Based on the above and as confirmed by both Hungarian court practice and legal literature, the statements of Mr Patrick Tausz made in Sections 4.6.1. and 4.6.2. of his Expert Opinion are fundamentally erroneous. Mr. Tausz states that the action brought by the State of Hungary with the Fej\u00e9r County Court claiming invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement* \u2018only created a pending situation concerning the validity of the Land Swap Agreement\u2019 *and that* \u2018until the standpoint of the Hungarian State was substantiated by a final and binding court decision, Mr. Yoav Blum could not be required to consider the Land Swap Agreement invalid\u2019. *Mr. Tausz seemingly ignores the very essence of the institution of nullity under Hungarian law, that nullity of a contract is unconditional, that it occurs by force of law, and that the establishment of a contract\u2019s nullity does not require a court proceeding or any other proceeding.\"635*\n\nVarga I, \u00b6\u00b636-37.\n\n538.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Prof. Varga\u2019s opinion well-reasoned, in particular as concerns the distinction under Hungarian private law between the two kinds of invalidity, nullity and voidability, and the absolute and unconditional character of nullity, which in the words of Prof. Varga *\"occurs by force of the law* /ipso iure\u2019/\u2019 without the requirement of a court proceeding. The Tribunal considers Prof. Varga\u2019s view convincing and therefore concludes that, as the Land Swap Agreement was null and void *ipso iure* in accordance with Section 200(2) of the Hungarian Civil Code, no legitimate right of possession within the meaning of Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract could derive therefrom. The same reasoning applies to the right to build.\n\n539.\n\nClaimant further argues that Respondent was responsible for both the lack of Mr. Blum\u2019s registration as the owner of the Sukor\u00f3 Site and the failure of the tract formation procedure, and therefore should not be allowed to terminate the Concession Contract based on a ground that was brought about by its own failures. Claimant refers to its expert, Prof. Kisfaludi, who opines that Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code prohibits Respondent from relying on the lack of registration, which was due to its own failures, as a basis for the termination of the Concession Contract.636\n\nKisfaludi, \u00b6\u00b6 64, 71. Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code provides: *\"Unless this Act prescribes stricter requirements, it shall be necessary to proceed in civil relations in a manner deemed reasonable under the given circumstances. No person shall be entitled to refer to his own actionable conduct in order to obtain advantages. Whosoever has not proceeded in a manner deemed reasonable under the given circumstances shall be entitled to refer to the other party\u2019s actionable conduct.\"* The Tribunal notes that the English translation submitted by Claimant as Exhibit AK-28A omits the word *\"not\"* in the last sentence; the correct meaning of this sentence would be: *Whosoever has not proceeded in a manner deemed reasonable under the given circumstances shall*  *not* *be entitled to refer to the other party\u2019s actionable conduct.*\n\n540.\n\nRespondent does not seriously dispute its responsibility for the failure of the tract formation procedure, but argues that this does not preclude it from relying on the lack of registration. Respondent refers to its expert, Prof. Varga, who opines that, according to the *Curia\u2019s* practice, the Hungarian Civil Code is not applicable to acts of administrative law, such as the issuance of the Tract Formation Permit; therefore, the culpability of civil law conduct, as required in Section 4(4), cannot be based on the alleged culpability of the administrative act of the construction authority.637 Prof. Varga further argues that, in any event, the construction authority\u2019s conduct would not qualify as culpable conduct within the meaning of Section 4(4). Prof. Varga refers to established case law, pursuant to which only a *\"flagrantly flawed interpretation and application of the laws in force\u2019\u2019* can amount to culpable conduct.638 In Prof. Varga\u2019s view, the failure of the construction authority to involve the Water Inspectorate in the tract formation procedure as a special authority for landscape protection, and the fact that the Town Clerk exceeded its subject matter jurisdiction in determining the shore line strip of the real properties, do not amount to such a *\"flagrantly flawed interpretation and application of the laws in force\u2019\u2019* and therefore do not constitute culpable conduct within the meaning of Section 4(4) of the Hungarian Civil Code.639\n\nVarga II, \u00b6 19.\n\nVarga II, \u00b6 20.\n\nVarga II, \u00b6 21.\n\n541.\n\nRespondent further states that, in any event, the tract formation procedure is irrelevant because the Land Swap Agreement was null and void and could not create any obligation for the MNV to conduct the tract formation procedure or to register Mr. Blum as the owner of the Sukor\u00f3 Site.\n\n542.\n\nConsidering that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void, the Tribunal is of the view that there is no need to decide whether Respondent is precluded from relying on failures for which it may be responsible. The alleged mismanagement of the tract formation procedure may well have delayed the formal act of registering Mr. Blum as the owner of the Sukor\u00f3 Site and may well have been due to Respondent\u2019s own failures. However, even if Mr. Blum had in fact been registered as the owner by 1 January 2011, his registration would not have made him the lawful owner of the Sukor\u00f3 Site, because the Land Swap Agreement was null and void. As stated by Respondent\u2019s expert Prof. Varga, *\"the Hungarian system of transfer of ownership qualifies as a system which requires a valid title for the transfer and in addition to the valid legal title, an act of transfer of the thing\"640* Therefore, even if the failure of the tract formation procedure was indeed due to Respondent\u2019s acts or omissions, ultimately this would not change the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\nVarga I, \u00b6 17.\n\n**c) The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion**\n--------------------------------\n\n543.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant has not established that SDI Europe had the legitimate right to possession of, and the right to build on, the Leased Real Properties as of 1 January 2011. Thus, Claimant failed to perform a material obligation of the Concession Contract and, in fact, the very first step in realizing the Project. As a consequence, the Tribunal considers that, in addition to the public policy reason set out above, Respondent also had a contractual ground for terminating the Concession Contract under Clause 9.3 with immediate effect pursuant to Clause 15.2.1.1.\n\n**G. Did Respondent Abuse its Contractual Termination Right in Order to Avoid Liability to Compensate?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n544.\n\nHaving reached the conclusion that Respondent had both a public policy reason and a contractual reason for terminating the Concession Contract, the remaining question is whether Respondent exercised its contractual termination right legitimately or whether, in the circumstances, it was an abuse intended to avoid the liability to compensate, thus amounting to a *\"fictitious\"* or *\"malicious\"* exercise of its contractual rights. If the latter were proven, the termination of the Concession Contract could amount to an expropriation. The burden of proof obviously lies with Claimant on this issue.\n\n545.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore examine whether Respondent acted contrary to good faith in terminating the Concession Contract rather than granting Claimant\u2019s request for an extension of that deadline in view of the *\"ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Sukor\u00f3 land.\"641*\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 98.\n\n**1. Summary of Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**a) Respondent Refused to Extend the Contractual Deadline**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent refused to extend the contractual deadline to certify a site for the Project beyond January 2011 even after it became clear that the courts would not render a decision in the Land Swap Litigation until much later.642\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 91.\n\n547.\n\nClaimant further states that it was Claimant\u2019s understanding throughout that, until the resolution of the Land Swap Litigation, the Land Swap Agreement remained valid and the Sukor\u00f3 Site remained the preferred site for the Project. Claimant contends that, on 5 October 2009, a few days before the signing of the Concession Contract, Respondent\u2019s Minister of Finance, Dr. Oszk\u00f3, assured Claimant that the Land Swap Agreement would be submitted to the Hungarian courts for validation in order to ensure that MNV\u2019s valuations of the land concerned were correct.643 Claimant submits that both Mr. Blum and Mr. Langhammer left the meeting of 5 October 2009 feeling positive in anticipation that a court would either approve the value or arrive at an adjusted value, which Mr. Blum would then pay.644 According to Claimant, during his meetings with Mr. Blum on 10 September and with Messrs. Blum and Langhammer on 5 October 2009, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 neither raised the possibility of starting the acquisition of the Sukor\u00f3 land *\"afresh\"* nor did he recommend terminating the Land Swap Agreement.645\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 450.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 42.\n\nReply, \u00b6 530; Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 38 *et seq.*\n\n548.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent\u2019s witnesses indicated that they envisaged no particular timeframe for resolution of this issue by the Hungarian courts. Claimant refers to Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s oral testimony in which he admitted that he had no comprehension of how long the Land Swap Litigation would take.646\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 92, referring to Transcript, p. 420, lines 14-19 and p. 523, lines 12-17.\n\n549.\n\nAfter Respondent initiated the Land Swap Litigation, the Project Sponsors began a diligent search for alternative sites. However, the Sukor\u00f3 Site remained the preferred site for the Project notwithstanding the search for possible alternatives. According to Claimant, Respondent was aware that Claimant was investigating new sites because Claimant conveyed this to Respondent in a letter from Mr. Gaye to Dr. Oszk\u00f3 dated 26 February 2010 and in another letter which Mr. Gaye personally handed over in a meeting with Mr. Tam\u00e1s Kocsis of the Ministry of National Development on 16 September 2010.647\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 94 *et seq;* **Exhibits C-144** and **C-249.**\n\n550.\n\nClaimant submits that, on 10 December 2010, KC Bidding requested that Respondent extend the time available *\"by an additional 12 months from the date when the so called Sukor\u00f3 site court case will be finished with a legally binding decision\"648* Claimant considers that this was a reasonable request given the Project Sponsors\u2019 understanding that the availability of the Sukor\u00f3 Site was dependent on the outcome of the case.649\n\n**Exhibit R-101.**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 97.\n\n551.\n\nClaimant submits that Respondent refused each of Claimant\u2019s requests to extend the time available to it to comply with its obligations under the Concession Contract, while it did grant a number of modifications to both the Dream Island concession contract and the EuroVegas casino concession contract. Claimant submits that this clearly evidences discriminatory treatment vis-\u00e0-vis Claimant.650\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 553-554; **Exhibits C-284, C-292** and **C-295.**\n\n552.\n\nClaimant further contends that Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract was *\"a disproportionate response to what were relatively minor purported contractual breaches\"651* As to the legitimate possession requirement, Claimant states that Respondent could have granted KC Bidding an extension of time *\"to remedy its purported non-compliance\"* with this requirement. Claimant asserts that such an approach would have been particularly proportionate in view of the *\"administrative inefficiencies\"* of Respondent\u2019s own organs in the registration procedure and of the multiple investigations that Respondent launched into its own conduct in relation to the Land Swap Agreement.652\n\nReply, **\u00b6 518;** *cf.* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 196.\n\nReply, \u00b6 520.\n\n553.\n\nIn this context, Claimant also relies on the case of *Occidental v. Ecuador* in which the tribunal held that *\"[t]he fact that a contractor agrees that caducidad* [i.e., termination] *may be a remedy in certain situations does not mean that the contractor has waived its right to have such a remedy imposed proportionately.\"653*\n\nReply, \u00b6 514, quoting from *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration And Production Company v. Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Award (5 October 2012), **Exhibit RLA-40, \u00b6** 422.\n\n554.\n\nClaimant concludes that the refusal of Respondent\u2019s representatives to meet with Claimant to discuss the status of the Project, including possible extensions of the contractual deadline that, it submits, were necessary as a result of Respondent\u2019s own conduct, constitutes a clear example of Respondent\u2019s lack of good faith.654\n\n*Cf.* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 98.\n\n**b) Respondent Prevented Claimant from Securing an Alternative Site**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n555.\n\nClaimant submits that it started its search for alternative sites, when the Land Swap Agreement was referred to the Hungarian courts, as a *\"Plan B\"* in case the Land Swap Litigation were not resolved in Claimant\u2019s favor by 1 January 2011. Claimant refers to Mr. Gaye\u2019s oral testimony, in which he stated that, after the MNV had initiated court proceedings to challenge the validity of the Land Swap Agreement, they *\"knew that there is a risk that by 1 January 2011, there will be a judgment against Sukor\u00f3 and, therefore,* [they] *started to look for alternative site* [sic].\"655\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 205; Transcript, p. 582, lines 2-5.\n\n556.\n\nClaimant submits that Mr. Gaye, who was primarily responsible for the search, identified *\"a few sites in Tatab\u00e1nya\"* and refers to his testimony, which confirmed that they had made it clear from the beginning that they would need the Government\u2019s support before being able to purchase the land.656 According to Claimant, the owner of the site at Tatab\u00e1nya was ready and willing to sell the land to Claimant for the realization of the Project; a draft purchase contract was prepared and the Project Sponsors entered into negotiations with the owner regarding the purchase price for the land.657 In Claimant\u2019s view, however, it was crucial that the newly elected Fidesz Government repeatedly failed to provide the Project with its support. Claimant concludes that, given this *\"manifest denial of support for the Project,\"* it decided not to purchase the Tatab\u00e1nya land.658\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 206, quoting Transcript, p. 599, lines 11-15.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 223.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 224.\n\n557.\n\nClaimant further asserts that Mr. Gaye met with significant hostility in relation to possible Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r sites and quotes Mr. Gaye\u2019s oral testimony that *\"the municipality in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r was very hostile to* [them].\"659 Claimant refers to the fact that the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Council issued a decision, by which it reversed its original support for the operation of a mega-casino at its settlement.660\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 207; Transcript, p. 587, lines 16-17.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 228.\n\n558.\n\nClaimant submits that, after Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter of 8 March 2010 in which he stated that Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r remained available as a possible site for the Project despite the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Council\u2019s decision to withdraw its consent, Mr. Gaye held a number of meetings with the owner of the land at Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. According to Claimant, however, it ascertained in consultation with its Hungarian architect that part of the land was a protected area and decided not to pursue this site any further.661\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 229.\n\n559.\n\nClaimant also submits that, in November 2009 and January 2010, Mr. Gaye met with Dr. Kl\u00e1ra Horv\u00e1th, the Mayor of B\u00e1bolna to discuss whether a site they had identified at B\u00e1bolna could be used for the Project. Claimant further asserts that, when the municipality announced a tender for the sale of land at B\u00e1bolna, Dr. Budai publicly attacked Dr. Horv\u00e1th by accusing her of corruption and the forgery of an official document and brought criminal proceedings against her. In light of Dr. Budai\u2019s attack and the surrounding adverse publicity, Claimant was *\"compelled\"* to abandon the possibility to relocate the Project to B\u00e1bolna.662\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 225-226, 455.\n\n560.\n\nClaimant asserts that it attempted to communicate with Respondent concerning its search for alternative sites. In Claimant\u2019s view, Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s response of 8 March 2010663 to Claimant\u2019s letter of 26 February 2010664 demonstrates Respondent\u2019s awareness that Claimant had commenced the search for alternative sites in light of the pending Land Swap Litigation. Claimant further submits that Mr. Gaye notified the Ministry of National Development of the new Fidesz Government about the search in a letter dated 16 September 20 1 0,665 which he personally handed to Mr. Kocsis.666\n\n**Exhibit C-145.**\n\n**Exhibit C-144.**\n\n**Exhibit C-249.**\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 209 *et seq.*\n\n561.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent continually undermined Claimant\u2019s search for alternative sites.667 Claimant refers to Mr. Langhammer\u2019s recollection during the Hearing that *\"as soon as one of the sites was identified, Dr. Budai made other noises about that site\"668* and to Mr. Fisher\u2019s statement, in relation to the land at B\u00e1bolna, that *\"B\u00e1bolna is the site that the Government spokesman Budai went in the press and called that B\u00e1bolna is like Sukor\u00f3.

In response to Respondent\u2019s assertion that Claimant knew at the time of the execution of the Concession Contract that the Sukor\u00f3 Site was no longer *\"available\"* for the Project, Claimant submits that the Concession Contract itself lists the Sukor\u00f3 Site as one of 133 available sites for the Project. Claimant submits that the Project Sponsors and Dr. Oszk\u00f3 therefore agreed at the time of the signing that the Sukor\u00f3 Site remained available unless and until a court decided otherwise.670 Claimant concludes that it was therefore not the case that, at the time of the signing, Claimant was forced to choose between starting the Land Swap Agreement *\"afresh\"* and finding an alternative site.671\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 215-216.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 217.\n\n**2. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a) Respondent Was Not Required to Extend the Contractual Deadline**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n563.\n\nRespondent submits that it was under no obligation to grant the investor an extension of time to comply with its contractual obligations under the Concession Contract.672 In Respondent\u2019s view, it was fully entitled to terminate the Concession Contract with immediate effect.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 391.\n\n564.\n\nRespondent considers that the principle of good faith cannot be used to negate a party\u2019s contractual rights or to amend the contractual terms agreed upon by the parties.673 Moreover, Respondent submits, there was no duty of cooperation beyond the clear terms of the Concession Contract.674\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 29; *cf.* \u00b6 202.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 205.\n\n565.\n\nRespondent refers to the drafting history of the Concession Contract and the fact that, although KC Bidding had repeatedly requested an extension of the deadline under Clause 9.3, the Ministry of Finance insisted that the deadline it had proposed was reasonable. Respondent submits that KC Bidding was therefore aware of the significance of the deadline under Clause 9.3 and could not have expected to receive any extension thereof.675\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 392.\n\n566.\n\nRespondent does not contest that Claimant repeatedly requested an extension of the contractual deadline to secure the Project site under Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract. However, Respondent submits that Claimant had been given over a year to find a suitable alternative to the Sukor\u00f3 Site.676 Respondent emphasizes that this contractual deadline to secure a Project site under Clause 9.3 was specifically negotiated by KC Bidding and the Ministry of Finance to *\"reflect the absence of a confirmed site at the time of the signature of the Concession Contract,\"* and to give the Project Sponsors sufficient time to secure an alternative Project site.677\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 199.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 200.\n\n567.\n\nRespondent submits that the Project Sponsors were, by early September 2009, fully aware of the risks relating to the validity of the Land Swap Agreement and of the resulting unavailability of the Sukor\u00f3 Site as the Project site. Respondent refers to the undisputed fact that, on 8 September 2009, the Project Sponsors attempted, during their discussion with Mr. Arvai, to extend the contractual deadline to secure their Project site until 1 January 2014, whereas the initial draft provided for 1 January 2011. Respondent submits that Claimant was thus fully aware that it might take a few years before the issue regarding the Land Swap Agreement was finally resolved.678\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 122.\n\n568.\n\nRespondent further emphasizes that, in light of the uncertainties surrounding the Land Swap Agreement and the discussions among Mr. Blum, Dr. B\u00e1rd and Dr. Oszk\u00f3, it was decided that the Sukor\u00f3 Site would not be the designated Project site in the Concession Contract and KC Bidding was instead given a choice among the 133 original settlements listed in the Tender.679 According to Respondent, this change in the Concession Contract necessarily indicates that the Parties understood that the Sukor\u00f3 Site may not be available for the Project, such that the Concession Contract had to offer alternatives.680 Respondent refers to Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s oral testimony during the Hearing in which he explained that the Parties had two options in terms of pursuing the Project: agree to restore the pre-swap conditions or otherwise proceed with the Project on an alternative site.681\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 124.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 128.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 129, referring to Transcript, p. 421, lines 1-8.\n\n569.\n\nIn any event, Respondent contends that the record shows that the Project Sponsors were informed and knew that, failing an agreement with the Hungarian authorities, the Land Swap Agreement would be referred to the courts.682\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 138.\n\n570.\n\nRespondent is of the view that the duties of good faith and cooperation cannot go beyond the unequivocal terms of the Concession Contract.683 Respondent concludes that Claimant had no expectation, much less a legal entitlement, that Respondent would extend the deadline. According to Respondent, *\"[t]here was in this respect no legal obligation to be performed by Hungary in good faith, whether under international law or Hungarian law, and moreover no duty of cooperation beyond the clear terms of the Concession Contract?\u2019684*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 202.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 205.\n\n571.\n\nIn response to Claimant\u2019s contention that the termination was *\"a disproportionate response to what were relatively minor purported contractual breaches\"* Respondent asserts that the principle of proportionality applies only to regulatory measures, but not to *\"a State\u2019s exercise of contractual rights as an ordinary contracting party?\u2019685* With regard to Claimant\u2019s quotation from the case of *Occidental v. Ecuador,* Respondent submits that the contract in that case was terminated by a ministerial decree, *i.e.,* a *\"purely regulatory measure.\"* as a sanction for the breach of a statute; consequently, the decision cannot support Claimant\u2019s argument that the proportionality principle can also be applied to a State\u2019s exercise of contractual rights.686\n\nRejoinder, 400; *cf.* Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, 242.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 401.\n\n572.\n\nIn any event, Respondent contends that the termination of the Concession Contract was *\"entirely proportionate,\"* given that Clause 15.2 did not provide for a notification requirement or an opportunity to remedy deficiencies in relation to the termination events invoked in the Termination Letter. Respondent argues that it was therefore entitled to immediately terminate the Concession Contract in response to KC Bidding\u2019s breaches of contract.687 In addition, Respondent submits that, by failing to find an appropriate site for the Project, *\"KC Bidding failed to comply with one of its core obligations under the Concession Contract\";* thus, Respondent\u2019s decision to terminate was proportionate and legitimate.688\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 402-403; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 243.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 404; *cf* Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 244.\n\n**b) Respondent Did Not Frustrate Claimant\u2019s Search for an Alternative Site**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n573.\n\nRespondent claims that, contrary to Claimant\u2019s allegations, Claimant\u2019s failure to certify *\"legitimate possession\"* of the Project site, as required under Clause 9.3 of the Concession Contract, is a consequence of its own decision not to secure one of the available Project sites within the deadline, and was not a result of Respondent\u2019s conduct in relation to the Land Swap Agreement.689\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 395.\n\n574.\n\nRespondent submits that both parties executed the Concession Contract on the understanding that it had become *\"unlikely\"* that the Project would proceed in Sukor\u00f3.690 Respondent argues that this is reflected in the drafting history of the Concession Contract in which, at the request of Mr. Blum\u2019s lawyer, Dr. B\u00e1rd, all references to the Sukor\u00f3 Site were deleted and the Concession Contract was amended so that the Project could proceed in any of 133 locations listed in Annex I.691 In addition, Respondent asserts that, at the 5 October 2009 meeting with Messrs. Langhammer and Blum, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 advised the Project Sponsors to identify an alternative location for the Project.692\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 396.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 396.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 397.\n\n575.\n\nRespondent submits that KC Bidding only formally reverted to the Sukor\u00f3 Site in the weeks preceding the 1 January 2011 deadline, having failed to secure an alternative site.693 Respondent is of the view that this was caused by the fact that Claimant had failed to find a *\"suitable\"* alternative site and therefore *\"chose\"* to abandon the sites that it had located for reasons unrelated to Respondent.694\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 400.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 187-188.\n\n576.\n\nWith regard to the potential site in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, Respondent claims that Claimant\u2019s contentions are misleading. Respondent maintains that while the Council of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r did seek to withdraw its support for the implementation of a casino on that settlement, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 confirmed to the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Council\u2019s notary that Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r was bound by its earlier consent to the construction of a casino on its settlement.695 Respondent submits that it was Claimant\u2019s decision not to pursue this site and refers to the statement of Mr. Gaye that *\"part of the land was a protected area and therefore no development could be made\"696*\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 293.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 189, referring to Gaye I, \u00b6 77.\n\n577.\n\nWith regard to the B\u00e1bolna site, Respondent claims that the documentary evidence shows that the Project Sponsors chose not to participate in the B\u00e1bolna tender in view of the short deadline for submissions.697\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 401; **Exhibit R-93.**\n\n578.\n\nAs regards the Tatab\u00e1nya site, Respondent again refers to Mr. Gaye, who confirmed in his witness statement that this privately-owned site had *\"the right zoning\u2019* for the Project, and that the owner was ready and willing to sell the land to Claimant. Respondent submits that the deal fell through for reasons unknown and unexplained. Respondent further submits that Claimant failed to explain why State support would have been necessary in the context of the sale of privately-owned land and that Claimant never sought assistance with respect to the acquisition of the Tatab\u00e1nya site.698\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 194-196.\n\n579.\n\nRespondent also refers to correspondence between Mr. Gaye and Mr. Orb\u00e1n of Artonic as evidence that Respondent did not in any way interfere with Claimant\u2019s efforts to secure an alternative site.699\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 402; **Exhibit R-99.**\n\n580.\n\nRespondent submits that, for reasons unrelated to Hungary, Claimant never even informed the Government that it was actively searching for an alternative site, as Claimant failed to comply with its reporting obligations under the Concession Contract, which were *\"the intended vehicle for the investor to inform the government of its progress in locating a Project site.\u2019\u2019700* Respondent asserts that the Government was kept in the dark about the search for alternative sites, and thus was persuaded that the Project Sponsors were no longer actively pursuing the Project.701\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 10.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 182.\n\n**3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider whether the principle of good faith under Hungarian law or international law required Respondent to refrain from exercising its contractual termination right.\n\n582.\n\nHungarian law governs the contractual analysis of the termination, and it requires a contracting party to perform its agreement according to the principle of good faith and cooperation. Article 4(1) of the Hungarian Civil Code states:\n\n*\"In the course of exercising civil rights and fulfdling obligations, all parties shall act in a manner required by good faith and mutual respect, and they shall be obliged to cooperate with one another.\"*\n\n583.\n\nUnder Hungarian law, if the Government were found to have exercised its contractual right of termination fictitiously or maliciously, it would have failed to act in good faith and abused its right. In those circumstances, termination would be a breach of contract actionable under Hungarian law. While contract breach under municipal law is not determinative of a Treaty breach, it may be relevant to that decision if the breach constitutes an abuse of right, and not a mere failure to perform.\n\n584.\n\nAt the same time, the Treaty and thus international law governs the decision of whether an expropriation occurred. Consequently, to the extent Hungary acted in its sovereign capacity and relied on public policy reasons in terminating the Concession Contract, international law is implicated in deciding whether the State\u2019s conduct is expropriatory. The Tribunal has already noted that there is common ground that good faith is also a fundamental principle of public international law for the performance of international obligations. It is applicable in assessing whether the State\u2019s exercise of a legal right, whether arising out of a contract or another source of law, is legitimate or amounts to an abuse of such right in order to avoid liability to compensate. Under the Treaty and international law addressing expropriation, if Hungary terminated the Concession Contract solely for public policy reasons, acting in its sovereign capacity, then its actions would constitute an expropriation. In making the determination of whether it acted solely for public policy reasons, a municipal law contract breach would be relevant as a factual element of the expropriation analysis if the Government articulated a contractual basis for termination abusively, whether fictitiously or maliciously, in order to avoid liability under the Treaty.\n\n585.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the principle of good faith, whether under Hungarian law or under international law, informs the manner in which an international or, in the case of Hungarian law a contractual, obligation is to be performed, but it is not in itself an independent source of obligations.702\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 28. According to the International Court of Justice in the *Border and Transborder Armed Action* case, *\"[t]he principle of good faith is; as the Court has observed,* \u2018one of the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations\u2019 *(Nuclear Tests, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 268, para. 46; p. 573, para. 49); it is not in itself a source of obligation where none would otherwise exist.\" Border and Transborder Armed Actions Case (Nicaragua v. Honduras),* International Court of Justice, Jurisdiction and Admissibility Judgment (20 December 1988), **Exhibit RLA-78,** and *Nuclear Tests Case (Australia v. France),* Judgment, *I.C.J. Reports 1974,* 253, **Exhibit CLA-41.**\n\n586.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the impact of the obligation of good faith on the present case cannot be decided in the abstract, but depends on the concrete circumstances under which the Concession Contract was negotiated and executed. In its analysis, the Tribunal will have particular regard to (i) the Parties\u2019 discussions regarding the Land Swap Agreement and their corresponding expectations regarding the availability of the Sukor\u00f3 Site for the Project prior to the signing of the Concession Contract, (ii) the role of the 132 alternative settlements as potential sites, and (iii) the reasons for Claimant\u2019s decision not to certify a site for the Project at any of those 132 alternative settlements.\n\n**a) Uncertainties Regarding the Availability of the Sukor\u00f3 Site at the Time the Concession Contract Was Signed**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the record shows that when KC Bidding signed the Concession Contract, it knew that the Sukor\u00f3 Site might not be available for the Project. A clear piece of evidence for this is Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter to Mr. Blum, dated 4 September 2009, more than a month before the Concession Contract was signed, in which Dr. Oszk\u00f3 stated:\n\n*\"As it is known to you, the swap transaction related to the Sukor\u00f3 properties has given rise to significant negative reactions on behalf of the general public in the recent weeks. Moreover, several specific legal concerns have occurred with regard to the property swap which has also been objected to recently by the Hungarian State Audit Office in the recent past. With regard to the above, I consider a review of the recent events necessary because, it is my well-grounded opinion that an investment project which is granted special treatment from the aspect of national economy can only be implemented if it is done without any objections pertaining to prevailing law and the public opinion.*\n\n*I am of the opinion that in the present situation, we need to find a solution for the legal concerns and those raised by the general public in relation to the property swap transaction. With regard to the latter and considering the fact that even the State Audit Office considered the property swap transaction to be legally null and void in its report, it is raised as a possibility that clarification of legal doubts and concerns can be ensured by the restoration of the previous ownerships of the properties involved in the swap transaction. Naturally, apart from and beyond these facts, I would still like to know the investor\u2019s position and solution proposals considering the legal and societal concerns occurring in wide circles, as well as the report of the State Audit Office and the prosecutorial procedures in progress before the competent state attorney offices with regard to the investment project.*\n\n*I recommend that the problems be discussed at a personal meeting and for this purpose, I hereby request that you kindly contact my secretariat at the following phone number: [... ].\"703*\n\n**Exhibit C-117.**\n\n588.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the State Audit Office is not a judicial body that would be empowered to declare the Land Swap Agreement null and void. Nevertheless, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 sent his letter of 4 September 2009 to Mr. Blum quite obviously in reaction both to publicity and to the legal concerns raised in the State Audit Office report. He referred to the fact that *\"even the State Audit Office considered the property swap transaction to be legally null and void\u2019* and raised *\"a possibility that clarification of legal doubts and concerns can be ensured by the restoration of the previous ownership of the properties involved in the swap transaction\"*\n\n589.\n\nThe Project Sponsors clearly understood the import of this letter. Mr. Blum immediately forwarded it to Mr. Langhammer. The record shows that, following receipt of the letter, Mr. Langhammer instructed Mr. Blum to seek legal advice.704 Four days later, in an opinion dated 8 September 2009, Dr. Varga, Mr. Blum\u2019s Hungarian attorney, addressed the risks regarding both the disproportionality of value and the public interest requirement that served as the basis for the opinion of the State Audit Office.705 With respect to the latter, Dr. Varga stated:\n\n\" [I]t *shall be noted that there is no provision of law, or any relevant court decision delivered in a similar case, which would allow for the acquisition of the whole territory of the property even if the public interest objective could be achieved by acquiring just a part of it. In lack of any guidance from legislation, this issue can only be settled by the assessment of all available data and documents regarding the given case, or before a court.\"706*\n\nTranscript, p. 921, line 14 - p. 922, line 16.\n\n**Exhibit C-110.**\n\n**Exhibit C-277.** In its Rejoinder, Respondent pointed out that this relevant portion of Dr. Varga\u2019s opinion was omitted in the English translation submitted by Claimant. Rejoinder, note 146.\n\n590.\n\nThus, Dr. Varga explicitly raised the issue whether the public interest objective allowed the acquisition of the whole territory of Mr. Blum\u2019s properties that were to be swapped for the Sukor\u00f3 Site given that the public interest objective could be achieved by acquiring only part of Mr. Blum\u2019s properties - the precise issue that later served as the basis for the *Curia\u2019s* finding that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void.\n\n591.\n\nIt is common ground that Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter of 4 September 2009 was followed by two personal meetings with the Minister in Hungary, the first on 10 September 2009, between Dr. Oszk\u00f3 and Mr. Blum, and the second on 5 October 2009, when Dr. Oszk\u00f3 met with both Mr. Langhammer and Mr. Blum. The testimonies of the participants differ as to exactly what was said at those meetings.\n\n592.\n\nWith regard to the first meeting on 10 September 2009, Mr. Blum stated in his first witness statement:\n\n*\"Dr. Oszk\u00f3 behaved cautiously during this meeting.*\n\n[...] [He] *repeat[ed] the concerns he raised in his letter of 4 September 2009. Indeed, it appeared to me that he was simply reading out his letter to me. [... ] It seemed that he was unsure what to say.\"707*\n\nBlum I, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n593.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Blum further stated:\n\n\"[T]o *the best of my recollection Dr. Oszk\u00f3 did not mention the possibility of restarting the land swap* \u2018afresh\u2019 *at this meeting. I am sure that I would recall if he had done so, given that I would have been open to discussing the possibility as a means of neutralising the adverse media attacks orchestrated by Fidesz around the land* *swap.\"*708\n\nBlum II, \u00b6 28.\n\n594.\n\nDr. Oszk\u00f3, on the other hand, stated in his first witness statement that, during the first meeting on 10 September 2009:\n\n*\"I explained to Mr. Blum that it was essential that a project of this importance be based on solid legal grounds and the acquisition of the land be conducted in a transparent manner, unlike what happened. I told him I was concerned that the legality of the Land Swap Agreement would not be upheld in a court of law, and proposed to start afresh the acquisition of the land in Sukor\u00f3. Mr. Blum insisted that the Land Swap Agreement was valid and that this transaction should be left untouched.*\n\n*He offered to pay Hungary a supplement that would correct any mistake made in the valuations. This was not acceptable as a matter of Hungarian law.\"709*\n\nOszk\u00f3 I, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\n595.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 further stated:\n\n*\"Mr. Blum states that I did not mention the possibility of starting the land swap transaction afresh. This is incorrect. That possibility was the main purpose for which I had organized the meeting. I had clearly announced this in my letter to Mr. Blum dated 4 September 2009 [...] The relevant part of the English translation of this letter provides that* \u2018it is raised as a possibility that clarification of legal doubts and concerns can be ensured by the restoration of the previous ownerships of the properties involved in the swap transaction. \u2019 *The purpose of our meeting was to discuss the possibility of starting the process again and we definitely discussed this at the meeting.*\n\n*[...] I distinctly recall explaining my concern that the validity of the Land Swap Agreement would not be confirmed by a court of law\"710*\n\nOszk\u00f3 II, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\n596.\n\nIn his oral testimony at the Hearing, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 stated in relation to the 10 September 2009 meeting:\n\n\"[A]s *I remember, we\u2019ve discussed whether we can restore the original situation and if yes, then how the lands can be acquired properly.\"711*\n\nTranscript, p. 441, lines 5-8.\n\n597.\n\nConcerning the second meeting among Dr. Oszk\u00f3, Mr. Blum and Mr. Langhammer on 5 October 2009, Mr. Blum claims that Dr. Oszk\u00f3 said nothing about terminating the Land Swap Agreement and, instead, noted that the values of the swapped lands could be *\"validated\"* by referral to a competent court.\n\n598.\n\nIn his first witness statement, Mr. Blum stated:\n\n*\"We also discussed the Land Swap Agreement. Dr. Oszk\u00f3 explained the public pressure on him to investigate the values of the properties involved in the land swap. He mentioned that it was possible he would need to initiate a court procedure in order to validate the values of those properties. He emphasised that, if there had been impropriety in the valuation, this was solely the responsibility of the MNV.* *Dr. Oszk\u00f3 noted that it was his responsibility to find out whether anything improper had indeed occurred with the valuation, since he was ultimately responsible for the careers of the MNV officials present in the room.\"712*\n\nBlum I, \u00b6 65.\n\n599.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Blum again stated:\n\n*\"Dr. Oszk\u00f3 made no mention of recommencing the land swap transaction. Instead, as I have indicated previously, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 explained the public pressure on him to investigate the MNV\u2019s calculation of the values of the properties that had been swapped.*\n\n*Mr. Langhammer, who was present at the meeting of 5 October, asked Dr. Oszk\u00f3 if there were any substantive problems with the transaction itself, other than the concerns about the MNV\u2019s valuations. Dr. Oszk\u00f3 replied that there were none. Only the values of the swapped lands were at issue, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 noted, and he stated that the values could be* \u2018validated\u2019 *by referral to a competent court. Dr.* *Oszk\u00f3 said nothing about terminating the Land Swap Agreement. If he had done this, it would have been a very serious matter for the Project Sponsors. I would have reacted to him and taken immediate action in response. In fact, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 only mentioned the issue of value, and this is why I offered to pay a supplement to make up the difference between the valuations conducted. If Dr. Oszk\u00f3 had raised wider issues of legality, I would not have done so as it would not have made sense to offer to pay the difference between valuations if there were outstanding legal issues.\"713*\n\nBlum **II,\u00b6\u00b6** 29-30.\n\n600.\n\nIn his testimony at the Hearing, Mr. Blum said with regard to the 5 October 2009 meeting:\n\n\"[Dr. Oszk\u00f3] *did not raise the issue of the Land Swap Agreement. He raised the issue of value that were creating what he called public concern, et cetera [...]714*\n\n*[...] and said that the issue of difference in value needs to be resolved715*\n\n[... ] [O]ne *of his further comments was that it might be that the issue of values needs to be validated by a Court. The Court will consider and will check the issue of difference in value and will validate this concern and this issue.716*\n\n*He never mentioned. He never suggested* [that discussions take place to try and restore the previous ownership of the properties].\"717\n\nTranscript, p. 795, lines 18-20.\n\nTranscript, p. 796, lines 13-14.\n\nTranscript, p. 798, lines 7-11.\n\nTranscript, p. 798, lines 12-15.\n\n601.\n\nMr. Langhammer, who attended only the 5 October 2009 meeting with Dr. Oszk\u00f3, stated in his first witness statement:\n\n*\"At that meeting, we discussed the land swap agreement that was by then in place between Mr. Blum and the MNV. Dr. Oszk\u00f3 informed us that it was his intention to validate the land swap agreement before a Hungarian court in order to confirm that the valuation of the swapped properties had been properly executed by the MNV. We did not envisage any difficulties with the validation procedure proposed by Dr. Oszk\u00f3. Indeed, my sense was that such a court validation process could be a helpful step for all parties in clarifying the position. I also felt that it would take the sting out of the attacks being made by Fidesz by de-politicising the valuation issue. No indication of any legal concerns regarding the land swap itself was made by either Dr.* *Oszk\u00f3 or the other MNV officials present. Dr. Oszk\u00f3 stated that the Concession Contract would be signed shortly.*\n\n*Mr. Blum, Dr. B\u00e1rd and I left the meeting with the Minister of Finance in a positive frame of mind. We all felt very confident that the Project was moving forward towards development.\"718*\n\nLanghammer I, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\n602.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Mr. Langhammer said:\n\n*\"I also raised the subject of the Land Swap Agreement at this meeting. Specifically, I asked Dr. Oszk\u00f3 whether there were any legal questions arising from the Land Swap Agreement, other than the valuation of the swapped properties. Dr. Oszk\u00f3 replied that there were* *none.\"*719\n\nLanghammer II, \u00b6 6.\n\n603.\n\nIn his testimony at the Hearing, Mr. Langhammer stated:\n\n\"[A]ll *1 recall is there is that Dr. Oszk\u00f3 mentioned to me that there was no other legal issues in this regard, and I said to him, If there\u2019s no other legal issues, then if Mr. Blum pays the difference, whatever the valuation says, will this solve the problem?*\n\n*And he said he may want to validate that through a court\"720*\n\nTranscript, p. 906, lines 8-15.\n\n604.\n\nDr. Oszk\u00f3, on the other hand, stated in his first witness statement, with regard to the 5 October 2009 meeting:\n\n*\"I reiterated that I was concerned with the validity of the Land Swap Agreement and that my recommendation was to terminate that Agreement on a consensual basis in order to start the acquisition afresh in a transparent manner. I further explained to Mr. Blum and Mr. Langhammer that, failing any agreement, I would be compelled to refer the question of the validity of the Land Swap Agreement to the courts. Finally, I mentioned that considering the situation, the Project Sponsors should identify an alternative location for the Pro-fret.\"721*\n\nOszk\u00f3 I. \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\n605.\n\nIn his second witness statement, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 testified:\n\n*\"I distinctly recall recommending at the 5 October 2009 meeting that the Land Swap Agreement be terminated on a consensual basis. My position in that regard merely reiterated what I had expressed to Mr.* *Blum during our 10 September 2009 meeting. And, as set forth in my first witness statement, while the discrepancy between the valuations of the swapped properties was certainly a key issue, my concern with the Land Swap Agreement was not limited to that; it extended to the transaction as a whole, which lacked transparency and appeared to have been concluded in dubious conditions.*\n\n*I also explained to Mr. Langhammer and Mr. Blum that, failing an agreement, I would be compelled to refer the question of the validity of the Land Swap Agreement to the courts. Mr. Langhammer contends that I never said I would be* \u2018compelled\u2019 *but rather that I was* \u2018considering making such a referral.\u2019 *Mr. Langhammer is playing with semantics here. I do not recall the precise wording I used but I am positive that I informed the investors that the Land Swap Agreement would be referred to the courts if it was not terminated consensually. Those were the only two available alternatives to resolve the Land Swap Agreement deadlock.\"722*\n\nOszk\u00f3 II, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n\n606.\n\nIn his testimony at the Hearing, when asked about Mr. Blum\u2019s and Mr. Langhammer\u2019s statements that there was no discussion at all about the restoration of the pre-swap conditions at the 5 October 2009 meeting, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 replied:\n\n*\"This was part of the letter I sent in September, so this issue was raised even a month ago. So I\u2019m just surprised how I could - how it would have been possible not to discuss that issue since it is the main issue I have raised already a month before, discussed once with Mr.* *Blum and that was the only occasion that I had a discussion with Mr. Langhammer. It would have been very strange not to discuss the issue. That was perhaps the most important issue at that time concerning the project.723*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*On the discussion of the 5th of October, the issue was not simply the valuation. The issue was whether the transaction was made properly and if not, how can we solve the situation.\"724*\n\nTranscript, p. 460, lines 4-13.\n\nTranscript, p. 474, lines 10-13.\n\n607.\n\nThe foregoing shows that the main point of disagreement between the witnesses is whether Dr. Oszk\u00f3 indicated at these meetings that Mr. Blum should restore the preswap situation and whether Dr. Oszk\u00f3 made it clear that failing an agreement with Mr. Blum, Respondent would refer the question of the validity of the Land Swap Agreement to the Hungarian courts. As regards the 5 October 2009 meeting, Mr. Langhammer\u2019s recollection is that Dr. Oszk\u00f3 said there were no legal questions arising from the Land Swap Agreement other than the value of the swapped properties, and that the court would be asked to *\"validate\"* the correct value in order to *\"confirm that the valuation of the swapped properties had been properly executed by the MNV\"* Dr. Oszk\u00f3, on the other hand, testified in both of his witness statements that he communicated to Mr. Blum and Mr. Langhammer on 5 October 2009 that, failing an agreement with Mr. Blum, he would be compelled to refer the question of the validity of the Land Swap Agreement to the courts, although Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s oral testimony during the Hearing created doubt as to whether this was actually the case.725\n\nTranscript, p. 466, lines 15-22 and p. 467, lines 1-7.\n\n608.\n\nThe Tribunal has no basis to prefer the recollection of one witness over that of another. However, the record shows that the Project Sponsors received various warning signals before they signed the Concession Contract. These warning signs include Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter of 4 September 2009 and Dr. Varga\u2019s opinion of 8 September 2009. In addition, as already noted above, Dr. Oszk\u00f3 and Dr. Budai held a joint press conference before the Ministry of Finance on 8 October 2009, *i.e.,* the day before the signing of the Concession Contract. During the press conference, Dr. Budai declared that he was of the view that the Land Swap Agreement was a void agreement and that the Minister of Finance should terminate the Land Swap Agreement with immediate effect.726 Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s position during this press conference was cited as follows:\n\n\"[Dr. Oszk\u00f3] *highlighted that the concerns in connection with the casino investment in Sukor\u00f3 are related to the plot exchange agreement and the value proportionality. According to him, a deadline should be set for reaching an agreement with the investor, and in case it is not reached, the asset manager shall think about legal steps.*\n\n*Peter Oszk\u00f3 added that they will try to reach primarily the cheapest solution, from the aspect of the state and highlighted that the termination of the agreement has to be compared with all the other such possibilities by which they could possibly reach a similar result, however, by involving less risk for the State.\"727*\n\n**Exhibit C-124.**\n\n**Exhibit C-124.**\n\n609.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal is not convinced that the outcome of the meeting of 5 October 2009 was that the court proceedings in Hungary would serve the sole purpose of *\"validating\u2019* the Land Swap Agreement in order to confirm that the valuation of the swapped properties had been properly executed by the MNV, and that there were no other legal concerns arising from the Land Swap Agreement. It is normally not the role of a court to *\"validate\"* valuations of properties. It may well be that there was a misunderstanding between Mr. Langhammer and Dr. Oszk\u00f3 as to the purpose of the possible court proceedings. But on balance, the Tribunal cannot share Claimant\u2019s position that the potential invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement, which had been mentioned by Dr. Oszk\u00f3 in his letter of 4 September 2009 with reference to the opinion of the State Audit Office, was no longer an issue.\n\n610.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal is not convinced that Respondent, at any time before the Concession Contract was signed, indicated to Claimant that it considered the Land Swap Agreement to be null and void as a matter of law prior to the Hungarian courts\u2019 ruling on the issue. There is no evidence in the record to support such a position. In particular, Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter of 4 September 2009, relied upon by Respondent in this regard, referred to the opinion of the State Audit Office but did not state that it reflected his own opinion or the Government\u2019s position generally. The fact that Respondent at the time considered a court decision necessary in order to *\"invalidate\"* the Land Swap Agreement is also reflected in Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s instructions to Dr. J\u00e1nos Nagy, President of the NVT, on 8 October 2009.728 It is true that the record shows that the new Fidesz Government apparently took the view in 2010 that the Land Swap Agreement was null and void, without the need for a court decision. However, at the time the Concession Contract was signed, there is no evidence that such view was communicated to Claimant.\n\n**Exhibit C-121.**\n\n611.\n\nOn the balance of the evidence, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that, at the date of signing the Concession Contract, Claimant must have known that although the Sukor\u00f3 Site was not off the table, failing an agreement with Mr. Blum on the restoration of the previous ownerships, as mentioned in Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s letter of 4 September 2009, this would become the subject matter of court proceedings. The Tribunal is aware that Mr. Blum stated that he was *\"surprised and shocked\u2019729* on learning, in the afternoon of 9 October 2009 after signing the Concession Contract, of the press release regarding Dr. Oszk\u00f3\u2019s instruction to the NVT to *\"take the necessary legal steps to invalidate the land-swap contract.\"730* Mr. Langhammer also testified during the Hearing that the press release *\"was a shock\"* to him.731 However, the Tribunal is of the view that it must have been clear to the Project Sponsors that such court proceedings would concern not only the possible disproportionality of the values of the swapped properties, but also the potential invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement. The issue of the potential invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement had been raised by the State Audit Office and in Dr. Oszko\u2019s letter of 4 September 2009 and both issues - the valuation issue and the potential invalidity - had been identified in Dr. Varga\u2019s opinion of 8 September 2009.\n\nBlum I, \u00b6 68; Blum II, \u00b6 36.\n\n**Exhibit C-128.**\n\nTranscript, p. 951, line 5.\n\n612.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that, if the Project Sponsors had really understood that the potential invalidity of the Land Swap Agreement was no longer an issue, one might have expected an immediate reaction from them after reading the Ministry\u2019s press release of 9 October 2009, as was the case on other occasions. In particular when the Special Project Status was revoked in November 2010, the Project Sponsors reacted with a series of letters to Government representatives. After the Ministry\u2019s press release, the Project Sponsors could have written a letter of complaint to Dr. Oszk\u00f3 or they could have requested a meeting - which undisputedly did not happen. Rather, Mr. Blum entered into negotiations with the MNV and, when these negotiations failed, the Project Sponsors began to look for alternatives sites.\n\n**b) The Introduction of 132 Alternative Settlements for the Project Site**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n613.\n\nIn these circumstances, the question arises why Claimant agreed in the Concession Contract to the deadline of 1 January 2011 for certifying the legitimate possession of the properties needed for the Project. As stated above, Claimant attempted to negotiate a much longer period, *i.e.,* until 1 January 2014. That proposal had been made by Dr. B\u00e1rd on 8 September 2009 at a meeting with Mr. Arvai at the Ministry of Finance when the first draft of the Concession Contract was discussed, and thus at a point in time when the Project Sponsors were already on notice of the legal concerns surrounding the Land Swap Agreement. Nevertheless, when Respondent refused to agree to the proposed extension, they ultimately accepted the original deadline of 1 January 2011 provided in the first draft. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it must have been clear to the Project Sponsors, who were advised by Hungarian counsel, that such deadline would probably be too short for any final decision to be rendered if the question of the validity of the Land Swap Agreement were to be submitted to the Hungarian courts.\n\n614.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes from this that the Project Sponsors must have known upon entering into the Concession Contract that, failing an agreement between Mr. Blum and Respondent, the validity of the Land Swap Agreement would be brought before the Hungarian courts, making it uncertain whether they could certify the Sukor\u00f3 Site as the site for the Project by the contractual deadline. It appears that the Project Sponsors accepted this risk because it was balanced by the inclusion of the 132 alternative sites. The Tribunal has no reason to believe that the contractual deadline of 1 January 2011 \u2014 which gave Claimant fourteen and a half months - provided too short a time period in which to acquire an alternative site for the Project.\n\n**c) The Reasons for Claimant\u2019s Decision Not to Certify an Alternative Site**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimant has not established its allegation that the new Government actively frustrated its search for an alternative site. The record shows that Claimant considered at least three alternative sites in the relevant time period between October/November 2009732 and the fall of 2010: Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, B\u00e1bolna and Tatab\u00e1nya.\n\nIn its Memorial, Claimant submits that it began to search for alternative sites, after the MNV had initiated the Land Swap Litigation, *i.e.,* on 18 November 2009. Memorial, \u00b6 221, referring to Gaye I, \u00b6 70. In its Reply, Claimant submits that the search started, after the MNV had *\"indicated its intention to commence court proceedings to invalidate the Land Swap Agreement\u2019* and refers to its engagement of Artonic Design Kft., a local architect firm, on 9 November 2009. Reply, \u00b6 69; **Exhibit C-278.** Mr. Gaye testified during the Hearing that he brought the search for alternative sites to the attention of the Project Sponsors and was told by Mr. Langhammer *\"to go ahead with if* at the end of October 2009. Transcript, p. 582, lines 6-12 and p. 583, lines 8-15.\n\n616.\n\nAfter Claimant identified Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r as a potential site for the Project, the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Council issued a decision on 3 December 2009 reversing its original support for the operation of a mega-casino in its settlement.733 The record shows that, in withdrawing its consent to have the Project located at its settlement, the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Council followed an initiative of the Fidesz Party. On 26 February 2010, Mr. Gaye wrote to Dr. Oszk\u00f3, requesting the assistance of the Ministry of Finance regarding this decision of the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Council. Mr. Gaye alternatively requested that the contractual deadline to secure a Project site be extended from 1 January 2011 to 1 June 2011 to compensate for time wasted searching for sites in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r.734\n\n**Exhibit C-280.**\n\n**Exhibit C-144.**\n\n617.\n\nDr. Oszk\u00f3 responded to Mr. Benkley on 8 March 2010, enclosing a copy of a letter he had written on the same date to Dr. Viktor B\u00f3ka of the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Mayor\u2019s Office, stating that the decision of the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Council had no effect upon the Concession Contract and that Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r continued to be available as a potential location for the casino.735 This shows that at least the interim Government of Prime Minister Bajnai supported Claimant\u2019s position that it could legally secure a Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r site.\n\n**Exhibit C-145** enclosing **Exhibit R-83.**\n\n618.\n\nFollowing this letter, according to the witness statement of Mr. Gaye, Claimant had several meetings with the owner of the Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r land being considered by Claimant. However, the Project Sponsors *\"realized through consultation with* [their] *local architect, Mr. Orb\u00e1n of Artonic, that part of that land was a protected area and therefore no development could be made. As a result,* [they] *decided not to pursue this site further.\"736* This shows that Claimant decided not to pursue this site for its own reasons.\n\nGaye I, \u00b6 77.\n\n619.\n\nWith regard to the B\u00e1bolna site, Mr. Gaye met with the Mayor of B\u00e1bolna, Dr. Kl\u00e1ra Horv\u00e1th, in November 2009 and again in January 2010, to discuss whether a site in B\u00e1bolna could be used for the Project.737 At the 21 January 2010 meeting at the B\u00e1bolna Town Hall concerning administrative procedures related to the Project (obtaining the relevant permits and licences), Mayor Horv\u00e1th *\"offered her help and her own contacts to support the whole procedure,\"738*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 225.\n\n**Exhibit C-401.**\n\n620.\n\nOn 10 August 2010, the Municipality of B\u00e1bolna announced a tender for the sale of the potential B\u00e1bolna site for the Project. Six days later, on 16 August 2010, Dr. Budai delivered a press conference in which he accused Mayor Horv\u00e1th of corruption and the forgery of a public document739 in connection with an unrelated transaction which also involved the sale of land in B\u00e1bolna.740 During the press conference, Dr. Budai remarked that *\"B\u00e1bolna was also one of these localities which showed up as a possibility* *when it turned out that no casino investment project was possible in Sukor\u00f3,\"* and that he was *\"not at all surprised about this new transaction by Kldra Horv\u00e1th\"741* According to Claimant, and undisputed by Respondent, Dr. Budai\u2019s allegations against Mayor Horv\u00e1th subsequently proved to be baseless.742\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 226.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 262; Rejoinder, \u00b6 214; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 193.\n\n**Exhibit C-140;** *cf.* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 263; Rejoinder, \u00b6 214; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 193. *See* also Reply, \u00b6 81.\n\nOn 8 November 2011, the Budapest Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Municipal Court of Budapest at the first instance that, in making these statements, Dr. Budai had unlawfully damaged the Mayor of B\u00e1bolna\u2019s reputation, and ordered the Fidesz Party and Dr. Budai to publish the judgment on the Fidesz Party\u2019s website for at least 30 days and to express their regret over the violations of Hungarian law and to pay damages. Memorial, \u00b6 227; **Exhibits C-143** and **C-311.**\n\n621.\n\nClaimant decided not to participate in the tender. Claimant submits that it was forced to abandon B\u00e1bolna as a potential site for the Project in light of the *\"toxic political environment created by Dr. Budai and the* [Fidesz] *Government he served\"743* However, at the same time, Mr. Gaye informed Mr. Ben Mol ever of Miller Buckfire on 18 August 2010 that KC Management would not participate in the tender because *\"there is a strong chance that this tender will be cancelled\"* and the municipality of B\u00e1bolna *\"wantfs] offers in two weeks with detailed plans which make it unreasonable for us\"744* It thus appears that the timing played a role in Claimant\u2019s decision not to participate in the tender for the site. Under these circumstances, Claimant has not evidenced that it was *\"compelled\u2019* to abandon this site because of the Fidesz Government\u2019s interference.\n\nReply, \u00b6 79.\n\n**Exhibit R-93.**\n\n622.\n\nIn May 2010, Claimant\u2019s investment bankers of Miller Buckfire also visited the Tatab\u00e1nya site. Claimant submits that the owner of the site was ready and willing to sell the land to Claimant for realization of the Project. A draft purchase contract was prepared and Claimant entered into negotiations with the owner regarding the purchase price of the land.745 Claimant claims that because the Fidesz Government repeatedly failed to provide the Project with the support that was integral to its success *(i.e.,* refusing to meet with Claimant\u2019s representatives to discuss the future of the Project), Claimant did not wish to spend money on the Tatab\u00e1nya site and decided not to pursue it.746 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Fidesz Government\u2019s general lack of support for the Project does not amount to actively frustrating Claimant\u2019s search for an alternative site.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 223; Gaye I, \u00b6 78.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 224; Gaye I, \u00b6 78.\n\n623.\n\nWhile the evidence indicates that the Fidesz Party, before coming to power after the national elections, sought to make a Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r site unavailable for the Project, the interim Government intervened to maintain its availability, and Claimant admits that it did not pursue this site for other reasons. Similarly, while Dr. Budai may have attempted to make a B\u00e1bolna site difficult by his public statements, Claimant again, by its own admission, failed to pursue the site for other reasons. Thus, Claimant has not established a causal link between the actions of the Government and its failure to obtain an alternative site.\n\n624.\n\nIn conclusion, the record does not establish that Respondent prevented Claimant from obtaining an alternative site. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, despite the hostility to the Project being located at the Sukor\u00f3 site, Claimant had a realistic opportunity to secure an alternative site within the contractual deadline, had it not apparently reduced its search efforts in the course of 2010. There is indeed no evidence in the record that Claimant made any further search efforts after August 2010. The Tribunal understands that the reason for Claimant\u2019s reduced efforts was its perception that the Fidesz Government was failing to provide the Project with support, in particular, by refusing to meet with Claimant\u2019s representatives and by failing to confirm its continued support for the Project in general.\n\n625.\n\nWhile Claimant argues that a Project of this magnitude could hardly be successful without governmental support, it must be observed that the Concession Contract did not provide for any form of support by the Government, be it in the form of infrastructure or financial or political support. In contracting with a State, there is an inherent risk that successive governments will change their policy. Had Claimant wished to ensure governmental support, it could have negotiated and incorporated specific contractual obligations to this effect in the Concession Contract. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, having failed to do so, Claimant may not now invoke the principle of good faith to create new and specific obligations on behalf of the Government.\n\n626.\n\nWhat Claimant had a right to expect was that the Government, having signed the Concession Contract, would perform it in good faith and cooperate with Claimant in accordance with the Concession Contract. But this Hungarian law obligation did not require the Government to forego its contractually-agreed right to terminate the Concession Contract when it was factually and legally supported, especially when the specific risk at issue was contractually allocated to Claimant by the inclusion of 132 alternative sites.\n\n627.\n\nIn these circumstances, it was at Claimant\u2019s own risk that it decided not to pursue its search for alternative sites. Likewise, it was Claimant\u2019s own decision to certify Sukor\u00f3 as the site for the Project on 21 December 2010, despite being aware of the legal uncertainties concerning this site, and after having received Dr. Kardkov\u00e1cs\u2019 response to Mr. Langhammer\u2019s 24 November 2010 letter on 17 December 2010, which did not contain the statement of support that the Project Sponsors had requested.\n\n**d) The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion**\n--------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nConsidering that Respondent added the deadline of 1 January 2011, and the 132 alternative sites, to the Concession Contract specifically to deal with the issue of the uncertainty relating to the Sukor\u00f3 Site as the location for the Project and to enable the Project Sponsors to *\"realize the casino project within the region in line with the law,\"* the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent\u2019s exercise of its contractual termination right on the ground that Claimant had not certified the *\"legitimate right to possession\"* of the Sukor\u00f3 Site does not demonstrate a lack of good faith on the part of the Government or an abuse of its rights under Hungarian law. The same is true for Respondent\u2019s refusal to extend the deadline until *\"12 months from the date when the so-called Sukor\u00f3 court case will be finished with a legally binding decision.\"*\n\n629.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal has also taken into account the fact that, according to Dr. Budai\u2019s frank statement, the impact of the cancellation of Special Project Status was that the Project Sponsors would face *\"a far longer process\"* to obtain a license or permission by established procedures.747 However, the Tribunal has already noted that Special Project Status was Sukor\u00f3-specific and could not have been used to accelerate the administrative process at any of the alternative sites. Mr. Langhammer\u2019s letter of 24 November 2010 shows that the Project Sponsors were aware of this as they requested confirmation that they would obtain a new special project status once they had obtained a new site. Under these circumstances, Dr. Budai\u2019s statement does not change the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Respondent did not abuse its rights in terminating the Concession Contract and refusing to grant Claimant\u2019s request to extend the contractual deadline.\n\n**Exhibit C-231.**\n\n630.\n\nAs discussed above, in a situation in which Respondent had both a public policy reason and a contractual reason for terminating the Concession Contract, Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim could only be successful if it proved that Respondent exercised its contractual termination right contrary to good faith or abused such right in order to avoid its liability to compensate under the Treaty. On the balance of the evidence, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proof that there was such conduct on the part of Respondent.\n\n631.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has also taken into consideration Claimant\u2019s argument that the termination of the Concession Contract was a *\"disproportionate response\"* to the purported breaches.748 The Tribunal already noted above that it considers Claimant\u2019s failure to secure a Project site within the time period provided for in the Concession Contract to be a material breach of the Concession Contract, which involved the very first step in realizing the Project. Thus, the Tribunal is of the view that this case is unlike the case of *Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador,749* cited by Claimant in this context,750 in which the investor\u2019s contract was terminated after Occidental performed the Contract, or at least substantially performed it, spending hundreds of millions of dollars exploring for oil, drilling wells, producing oil, and marketing it. Because of the advanced stage of contract performance, the *Occidental* Tribunal was required to determine if the termination was proportional to the breach. By contrast, since contract performance in this case involved only the first, threshold step for performance, which was never consummated, no proportionality analysis can or need be performed.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 518 *et seq.;* Claimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 196 *et seq.*\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration And Production Company v. Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Award (5 October 2012), **Exhibit RLA-40.**\n\nReply, \u00b6 514.\n\n632.\n\nAs a final conclusion, the Tribunal holds that Claimant has not established that Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract, as a matter of fact, amounted to an expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment pursuant to Article 4(1) of the Treaty. Consequently, the Tribunal dismisses Claimant\u2019s claim in its entirety, thus granting Respondent\u2019s request as set out above at paragraph 243 (i). As regards Respondent\u2019s request set out at paragraph 243 (ii), *i.e.,* to declare that Respondent did not expropriate Claimant\u2019s investment in Hungary, the Tribunal denies this request as being unnecessary in that such declaration is implicit in the Tribunal\u2019s decision to reject Claimant\u2019s claims in their entirety.\n\n**e) Final Observation**\n------------------------\n\n633.\n\nAs a final observation, the Tribunal notes that during the course of the Project and its negotiation, certain anti-Semitic remarks were published about the Project or its Sponsors.751 In Claimant\u2019s view, Respondent did not take any actions against the persons responsible for these anti-Semitic incidents and therefore violated its duty not to act in a discriminatory way.752 Although the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction beyond the expropriation determination, the Cyprus-Hungary BIT itself does impose anti-discrimination obligations on the State (duty not to impair the operation, management, use, enjoyment, or disposal of the investment by discriminatory measures in Article 3(1); duty not to deprive investors of their investment unless the measures are not discriminatory in Article 4(l)(b)). The Tribunal also recalls that the tribunal in *FFIC v. Mexico* held that discrimination may also, to a certain extent, be relevant to the determination of whether an expropriation occurred.753 The Tribunal takes these concerns of discrimination very seriously. Remarks such as those published are always a concern. However, the Tribunal has not found any such remarks that are clearly attributable to the State.754 In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal also cannot find a causal link between the publications in question and the termination of the Concession Contract since Respondent had a legitimate contractual basis for such termination. In addition, the Tribunal has noted that Respondent distanced itself from these remarks in its Counter-Memorial.755 Dr. Orb\u00e1n, the Fidesz Government Prime Minister, also stated publicly that there was no place for anti-Semitism in Hungary and that *\"he and the rest of the country would protect Hungary\u2019s Jewish population\"756* Thus, the Tribunal cannot find that the contractual termination in question was discriminatory.\n\nDuring a demonstration against the Project, placards with Mr. Lauder\u2019s photo and the legend *\"Jewish invasion of Lake Velence\"* were displayed.

SUMMARY OF THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n634.\n\nTo summarize its decision, the Tribunal emphasizes the following:\n\n(i) It is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal has jurisdiction only to determine whether Claimant\u2019s investment was expropriated\n\n(ii) Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim is based primarily on Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract, purportedly on contractual grounds\n\n(iii) The Tribunal cannot find an expropriatory effect based on the pre-termination conduct of Respondent\n\n(iv) The Tribunal determined that in order to sustain its claim that the termination of the Concession Contract was expropriatory, Claimant must prove that:\n\n(1) Respondent acted in its sovereign capacity in terminating the Concession Contract, such as for a non-contractual public policy reason, and\n\n(2) Respondent did not legitimately terminate the Concession Contract based on a contractual ground. The latter element involves proving that: (i) the contract was not terminated by the contractual procedure but rather by legislative act or executive decree, or (ii) even if the contractual procedure was used, that the factual and/or legal basis for the invoked contractual grounds for termination did not exist, or (iii) if it did exist, that the State invoked such basis abusively, *i.e.,* either fictitiously as a mere pretext for other reasons or maliciously, thereby failing to act in good faith.\n\nIn this case, both Hungarian law and international law are relevant. Hungarian law governs the contractual analysis of the termination, but the Treaty and thus international law governs the decision of whether an expropriation occurred. To the extent Hungary acted in its sovereign capacity for a public policy reason in terminating the Concession Contract, international law is implicated in deciding if its conduct is expropriatory. The good faith standard and the related concept of abuse of rights are clearly part of Hungarian law for performance of contracts. The good faith standard is also part of international law applicable in assessing whether the State\u2019s exercise of a legal right, whether arising out of a contract or another source of law, is legitimate or amounts to an abuse of such right in order to avoid liability under the Treaty.\n\n(v) At the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal noted that the Concession Contract was terminated by the contractual procedure, not by legislative act or decree.\n\n(vi) As a first step in its analysis, the Tribunal determined that Respondent did terminate the Concession Contract in part based on a public policy reason, and thus acted in its sovereign capacity, to that extent, in doing so. Specifically, Respondent terminated the Concession Contract in part based on new environmental and touristic public policies. In addition, concerns about corruption in the land swap, although such concerns ultimately proved unfounded, may also have played a role in the Government\u2019s decision to terminate the Concession Contract.\n\n(vii) In the second step of its assessment, the Tribunal determined that two of Respondent\u2019s stated reasons for termination did not legally justify termination of the Concession Contract, but a third reason stated by Respondent was expressly provided in the Concession Contract as a basis for termination and did involve a good faith exercise of the termination right. The termination was based on the failure of Claimant to perform a material, or core, obligation of the Concession Contract, and in fact, the very first step in realizing the Project *(i.e.,* securing a site for the construction of the Project within the time period provided in the Concession Contract). Although Claimant obtained possession of the Sukor\u00f3 Site and designated it, Claimant never obtained legitimate possession of, and the right to build on, that site because the Land Swap Agreement was null and void *ipso jure* for failure to satisfy the public interest requirement. Serious concerns about this issue were known to Claimant at the time the Concession Contract was signed, and precisely because the Government was going to submit the validity of the Land Swap Agreement to the courts for judicial determination (absent an agreement with Mr. Blum), the Government included in the Contract a list of 133 potential sites (still including Sukor\u00f3 as one of them) at which the Project could be located. Claimant thus had ample options but failed to secure any site other than Sukor\u00f3, thereby assuming the risk that it would not have a valid title. Thus, the Government had a contractual basis for termination.\n\n(viii) Moving to the third step, the Tribunal decided that Respondent did not exercise its contractual termination right fictitiously or maliciously, and therefore did not abuse it. While Claimant presented some evidence indicating that the Fidesz Party, while in opposition, sought to frustrate the search for three alternative sites, for two of those sites the evidence shows that Claimant had other reasons for not securing them. As regards the third site, Claimant alleges only that the Fidesz Government, once it came to power, failed to meet with Claimant\u2019s representatives and provide support for the Project. However, this is an insufficient reason for not securing a site, as required by the Concession Contract. Respondent was required to perform the Concession Contract, as agreed and in good faith, but it was not legally required to provide general political support for the Project beyond the terms of the Concession Contract. Thus, the Tribunal cannot find any causal link between the actions of the Government and the failure of Claimant to obtain an alternative site. The Tribunal also took into account in its analysis the stage of the investment at the time of the termination. Claimant\u2019s breach involved the very first step in realizing the Project - securing a site on which to build it. No construction or operations ever took place under the Concession Contract. Thus, this case is unlike *Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador* in which the investor\u2019s contract was terminated after Occidental performed the contract, or at least substantially performed it. Because of the advanced stage of contract performance, the *Occidental* tribunal was required to determine if the termination was proportional to the breach. Under the facts of this case, however, proportionality of the termination is not an issue.\n\n(ix) The heart of the issue is this. The Project straddled a national election campaign and two government administrations. The first supported the Project, while the second did not. This undoubtedly put Claimant\u2019s investment in an unfortunate situation. But while the Fidesz Government did not politically support the Project, it did not breach the Concession Contract either. The Fidesz Party during the 2010 political campaign attacked the Project primarily because of suspected corruption in securing the Sukor\u00f3 Site, although it must be stressed again that no corruption was ever proved. After the Fidesz Government took power in May 2010, it refused to meet with the Project Sponsors or offer the political support requested by the Sponsors. Claimant in this case has emphasized that the Project could not go forward and succeed without active government support. When it failed to obtain that support from the new Government, Claimant seems to have been unwilling to spend any more money and abandoned any real efforts to obtain an alternative site. In fact, in light of Claimant\u2019s insistence that the Project could not succeed without the new Government\u2019s active support, it seems doubtful that Claimant would really have committed the EUR 800 million necessary to build the Project at Sukor\u00f3, or elsewhere, without ongoing Government support, which was not forthcoming. While Claimant alleged that the new Government wished to destroy the Project, and presented some evidence to this effect, Claimant never tested the Government\u2019s intent to comply with the Concession Contract by obtaining a site that would satisfy Claimant\u2019s threshold contractual obligations. Since it failed to do so, Respondent had a legitimate contractual basis for terminating the Concession Contract. Had Claimant obtained a legitimate right to possession and the right to build on an alternative site, and certified it to the Government before 1 January 2011, it would have satisfied its contractual obligation and any termination at that point might well have been expropriatory. But Claimant did not do so. Also, if Claimant had proved that the Government prevented it from obtaining an alternative site, that might have been expropriatory, but Claimant failed to prove such conduct. Therefore, on the facts before it, the Tribunal concludes that there was a material breach of contract by Claimant justifying termination, and no proven abuse of right by Respondent; consequently, Claimant\u2019s investment was not expropriated by Respondent\u2019s termination of the Concession Contract.\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION ON COSTS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n635.\n\nIn its Statement of Costs dated 21 March 2014, Claimant seeks to recover from Respondent fees and expenses for legal services in the amount of EUR 6,988,039.09, fees and expenses for experts in the amount of EUR 1,485,615.42, administrative fees of ICSID and the Members of the Tribunal in the amount of EUR 289,855.07 and other costs and expenses in the amount of EUR 205,501.15, totaling the amount of EUR 8,969,010.73.757 Claimant also seeks interest on such amount at the three-month EURIBOR rate plus 4%, compounded on a quarterly basis, until full payment is made.758\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Costs dated 21 March 2014.\n\n*See* request for relief at paragraph 222 above.\n\n636.\n\nIn Hungary\u2019s Submission on Costs dated 21 March 2014, Respondent seeks to recover from Claimant fees and expenses of legal counsel (incurred through 13 February 2014) in the amount of USD 7,214,369,759 fees and expenses of its expert witnesses in the amount of USD 1,336,620, the amounts paid to the ICSID Secretariat in the amount of USD 375,000 and the expenses incurred by its representatives and witnesses in attending the hearings in Washington, D.C. in the amount of USD 32,161, totaling the amount of USD 8,958,15O.760\n\nAccording to Hungary\u2019s Submission on Costs dated 21 March 2014, legal fees in the amount of EUR 1,529,094 and costs and disbursements in the amount of EUR 158, 348 remain to be invoiced.\n\nHungary\u2019s Submission on Costs dated 21 March 2014.\n\n637.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award\"*\n\n638.\n\nArticle 61(2) does not prescribe a particular test for tribunals to assess costs, nor does it place any restrictions on a tribunal\u2019s ability to do so. In light of this, the Tribunal understands the power granted under this Article to be broad, allowing the Tribunal discretion in making its determination.\n\n639.\n\nHaving taken into account all the circumstances of the case and exercising its discretion, the Tribunal concludes that it is fair and appropriate that the Parties bear the costs of the arbitration761 in equal shares and that each Party bears its own costs and legal fees. This conclusion is reached considering that, while Claimant has not prevailed on its expropriation claim, the only claim over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction, it has raised reasonable issues in good faith and presented an arguable case. Thus, the Tribunal, acting within its sound discretion, rejects each Party\u2019s application for costs.\n\n*I.e.,* the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and the expenses and charges of the Secretariat. The Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account once the account has been finalized.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n640.\n\nFor the reasons referred to above, the Tribunal renders the following\n\n**AWARD**\n\nI. Claimant\u2019s claims listed at paragraph 220 are dismissed.\n\nII. Respondent\u2019s claim listed at paragraph 241 (i) is granted.\n\nIII. Respondent\u2019s claims listed at paragraphs 241 (ii), (iii) and (iv) are dismissed.\n\nConsequently,\n\nIV. The Parties shall bear in equal shares the costs of these proceedings, comprising of the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and the expenses and charges of the Secretariat, the exact amount of which shall subsequently be notified to the Parties by the Secretariat.\n\nV. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses.\n\nVI. All other claims are dismissed."}]}
