Whether the BIT extends to the Macao SAR**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the BIT does not provide protection to the Claimant because the BIT does not extend to cover the Macao SAR.49\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 32-37.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the PRC resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Macao in 1999, and established Macao as an SAR pursuant to Article 31 of the PRC Constitution and the Macao SAR Basic Law.50 The Respondent alleges that the Macao SAR Basic Law establishes the capacity of Macao to enter into international trade arrangements on its own behalf51 and to adopt its own policies and laws on the protection and development of industry and commerce,52 which includes the power to execute bilateral investment treaties.53 It further contends that the Macao SAR Basic Law provides that international agreements to which the PRC is a party would not apply automatically in the Macao SAR but must instead be decided by the Central Government of the PRC.54\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 71.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 27; Articles 106 and 112 of the Basic Law of the Macao SAR (RE-09).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 28; Article 114 of the Basic Law of the Macao SAR (RE-09).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; Articles 22 and Article 136 of the Basic Law of the Macao SAR (RE-09).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 31; Article 138 of the Basic Law of the Macao SAR (RE-09).\n\n53.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is common ground that Article 29 of the VCLT, which contains the customary international law rule of \"moving treaty frontiers\", is operative in this case because Laos and the PRC are both signatories to the VCLT.55\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that Article 15 of the VCST is an expression of customary international law.56 According to the Respondent, the rule is \"commonly understood to have two aspects, one negative (treaties of the predecessor State cease to be in force in the portion of territory in question, except for certain types of treaties or specific circumstances) and one positive (treaties of the successor State become in force in the portion of territory in question, except for certain types of treaties or specific circumstances).\"57 The Respondent specifies that the \"rule formulated in Article 15 of the [VCST] in its negative and positive aspects and the exceptions applicable to the rule in both aspects are well grounded in customary international law.\"58\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 2-12, referring to, *inter alia,* Cahier, \"Quelques aspects de la Convention de 1978 sur la succession d\u2019Etats en mati\u00e8re de trait\u00e9s\", in Dutoit and Grisel (eds), *M\u00e9langes Georges Perrin* (Lausanne: Payot, 1984), pp. 73-74 **(\"Cahier\")** (RA-39). In an e-mail dated 17 November 2013, the Claimant submitted that the Respondent\u2019s reference to Cahier:\n\n\"misleadingly implies that Cahier was discussing the exceptions in Article 15 as being custom, when it is clear from an even cursory review that he was instead describing the customary moving treaty frontiers rule - *and not* the exceptions that were added to Article 15 by the International Law Commission. (The full, brief discussion by Cahier of Article 15 was the following: \u2018Article 15 provides that when part of a State\u2019s territory becomes part of the territory of another State, the predecessor\u2019s treaties cease to apply and the successor\u2019s treaties become applicable to it. This rule is the corollary of the principle announced in Article 29 of the VCLT, according to which a treaty is binding upon each party with regard to its entire territory. This provision corresponds to State practice, it was adopted without amendment at the Conference and it simply codifies a customary rule.\u2019).\" (Claimant\u2019s emphasis) See also Hearing Transcript, pp. 54, 57.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent submits that both Articles 29 of the VCLT and Article 15 of the VCST coexist, are \"very closely connected\" and compatible.59\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 22.\n\n56.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s case that the Treaty does not extend to the Macao SAR because it falls within the exceptions to Article 29 of the VCLT60 and the exceptions to Article 15 of the VCST.61\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 35-37; Hearing Transcript, p. 16.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 32; Hearing Transcript, pp. 15-16.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the 1999 Notification filed by the PRC with the UN Secretary-General as depositary operates as a reservation to the territorial application of the BIT to the Macao SAR.62 The Respondent emphasizes that the 1999 Notification *specifically* provided for the application of the treaties listed in its Annexes I and II to the Macao SAR,63 and that the BIT was not listed in either of these two Annexes.64\n\nHearing Transcript, pp. 20, 148-149.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 41.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 42; Hearing Transcript, pp. 18-19.\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent cites paragraph IV of the 1999 Notification, which states that the PRC \"will go through separately the necessary formalities for [the] application [of treaties that are not listed in the Annexes to this Note] to the Macao [SAR] if it so decided.\"65 The Respondent argues that Laos would have had to have been notified separately if the BIT were to be extended to the Macao SAR and it was not.66 The Respondent also notes that Article 138 of the Macao SAR Basic Law requires consultation with the Macao SAR before a decision regarding treaty application, and points to the absence of evidence in this case that the Macao SAR has indeed been consulted.67\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43;

Hearing Transcript, pp. 59-60.\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the argument of the Claimant that the 1999 Notification relates only to multilateral treaties by stating that: (a) the Overview of the UN Treaty Collection **(\"UNTC\")** does not distinguish between the different locations as to where the 1999 Notification is deposited; (b) the UNTC covers both multilateral and bilateral treaties; (c) the capacity of the UN to register, file and record treaties is not distinct as between bilateral and multilateral treaties; (d) Article 102 of the UN Charter requires \"treaties\" and \"international agreements\" to be registered with the Secretariat before parties to such treaties or agreements can invoke them before an organ of the UN, and, while neither the UN Charter nor the regulations define either term, the Secretariat defers to the definition of Member States submitting such instruments for registration; and (e) there is no distinction with regard to the depositary practice for bilateral and multilateral treaties.68 The Respondent further notes that the requirements for the deposit of instruments does not limit the UN Secretary-General to acting as depositary for multilateral treaties alone (in spite of the focus on multilateral treaties by the Summary of Practice of the Secretary-General as Depositary of Multilateral Treaties69) as evidenced by the phrase \"deposit of binding instruments.\"70\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 42, referring to the UNTC at http://treaties.un.org;

see also Summary of UNSG Depositary Practice (RA-03).\n\n60.\n\nFurther, the Respondent submits that the reference to \"multilateral treaties\" in the UN document containing the 1999 Notification does not change the *effect* of the PRC\u2019s notification in which the PRC expressly refers to international agreements, and draws no distinction between multilateral or bilateral treaties.71 The Respondent also argues that the Claimant\u2019s submission that the notification only applies to treaties that are to be deposited with the Secretary-General as depositary is irrelevant because that is an external reference and what should be considered is the intent of the PRC as expressed in the 1999 Notification, *i.e.,* that the Treaty is not listed as one that extends to the Macao SAR.72\n\nHearing Transcript, pp. 149, 155-156.\n\nHearing Transcript, pp. 149-150.\n\n61.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, there exists an important body of practice as well as authority regarding the qualification of the rule of automatic succession (or extension) of treaties when it comes to certain types of treaties or circumstances, *e.g.,* \"personal\" or \"bilateral\" treaties.73 According to the Respondent, the 1999 Notification drew a distinction between (a) treaties that apply to Macao by virtue of the application to the entire Chinese territory (including Macao) as a result of their character *(e.g.,* treaties concerning foreign affairs or defense); and (b) treaties that applied to Macao before 20 December 1999, the date of transfer of sovereign rights.74 To determine whether treaties concluded by the PRC but not included in the 1999 Notification extend to Macao, the Respondent considers that it is necessary to refer to the treaty-making powers of Macao under the Joint Declaration and the Macao SAR Basic Law.75\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 20; Joint Declaration (RE-11); Basic Law of the Macao SAR (RE-09).\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes the fact that both instruments recognize Macao\u2019s treaty-making powers in economic and cultural matters.76 The Respondent argues that \"[u]nder these conditions, there can be no doubt that bilateral investment treaties and other commercial treaties concluded by China with third countries do not automatically apply to Macao under the positive aspect of the basic rule [of Article 15] but are instead the object of an exception to such rule.\"77\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 20;

Hearing Transcript, p. 27.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that a state\u2019s unilateral declaration can create legal obligations,80 regardless of the declaration\u2019s form.81 The Respondent contends that good faith binds States to international obligations that are created by a unilateral declaration and that interested States are entitled to demand that such obligations be respected.82 The Respondent argues that paragraph IV of the 1999 Notification entitles Laos to rely on the PRC\u2019s unilateral declaration and supports its legitimate expectation that the BIT not be extended to the Macao SAR until the PRC made a notification to this effect.83\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 49-51, referring to the *Nuclear Tests Case (New Zealand v.

In 1999, when the PRC assumed sovereignty over Macao and established the Macao SAR, the PRC could not have extended the application of the BIT to Macao because the governmental powers of the Macao SAR were established in the Macao SAR Basic Law.90 It further notes that trade and investment policy operate separately as between Mainland China and the Macao SAR.91 This is illustrated, the Respondent contends, by the fact that the Macao SAR entered into separate BITs with the Netherlands and Portugal after 1999.92\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent clarifies that the issue of the territorial application of the BIT to the Macao SAR involves and is intended to involve consideration of the PRC Constitution and the Macao SAR Basic Law, as established by legal authority and references in the BIT to municipal law.93 The Respondent notes that Article 18 of the Macao SAR Basic Law provides that PRC national laws must be listed in Annex III if they are to be incorporated in the laws of the Macao SAR.94 On this basis, the BIT has never been extended to the Macao SAR and therefore can only have effect in Mainland China.95\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 67-70, referring to Corten & Klein, pp. 737-738 (RA-04), the Preamble and Articles 7 and 12 of the Treaty.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 76.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 76.\n\n69.\n\nIn response to the argument of the Claimant that the PRC could have prevented the default application of the \"moving treaty frontiers\" rule by expressly excluding Macao from the territorial scope of the BIT when it was executed in 1993, as the PRC and Portugal had already entered into the Joint Declaration on the issue of Macao at that time, the Respondent states that: (a) in 1993, the PRC did not have the jurisdiction to state the position of Macao; and (b) the Joint Declaration of the PRC and Portugal entered into in 1987 contains provisions\u2014namely, Articles 3, 4, and 5 and Annex II\u2014regarding the autonomy of Macao that were still being negotiated and had not yet been finalized in 1993, making it impossible to ascertain the effect of this Joint Declaration at that time.96 Moreover, the Claimant contends that the Joint Declarations entered into by the PRC for Macao and Hong Kong with Portugal and the United Kingdom respectively oblige it to maintain their capitalist systems and respect their autonomy.97\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 26, referring to the Joint Declaration (RE-11).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 41.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the Claimant relies on the exception in the Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the PRC on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments **(\"PRC/Russia BIT\")** concerning its application to the Macao SAR.98 The Respondent argues that, in that case, the PRC merely reiterated its position as enunciated in the 1999 Notification; it chose to create the exception in the text of the treaty itself.99 The Respondent asserts that this does not undermine or nullify the legal effect of the 1999 Notification,100 and is \"consistent with the position adopted by China since the resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\"101\n\nPRC/Russia BIT, signed 9 November 2006 (CLA-90).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 40.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 40.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 26.\n\n71.\n\nIn response to the argument of the Claimant that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the BIT would be contrary to the purpose of the investment treaty regime, in that it would deny Hong Kong and Macao investors the protection available to other Chinese investors, the Respondent submits that by the provisions of the Macao SAR Basic Law, Macao is given full autonomy of its economic affairs, including the power to enter into agreements with other States in the field of economics and trade (Articles 136 and 138 of the Macao SAR Basic Law).102 This internal arrangement, the Respondent claims, evidences the intention of the PRC, enunciated in the 1999 Notification, to preclude the automatic application of the \"moving treaty frontiers\" rule in relation to both the PRC\u2019s bilateral and multilateral treaties entered into before the handover.103 This is not inconsistent with the purposes of the investment treaty regime, the Respondent argues, because the economic structure and development of the PRC and Macao was indisputably different in 1999.104\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 26.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 26.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 26.\n\n72.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s argument that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation would have a wide impact as it would be applicable to all Chinese BITs, the Respondent submits that the *Claimant\u2019s* interpretation would have the effect of rendering over 130 BITs automatically applicable to Hong Kong and Macao; something that was never contemplated.105 This number exceeds the number of BITs each SAR has entered into in its history.106 It also brings the application of the BIT under an exception to Article 15 of the VCST by radically changing the condition of its operation.107 The Respondent points out that the Macao SAR has the autonomy to enter into its own BITs with other States,108 and, like Hong Kong, it *has* entered into its own BITs with other States.109\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 39;

Macao/Netherlands BIT (CLA-128); Macao/Portugal BIT (CLA-129); PRC/Netherlands BIT (CLA-130); PRC/Portugal BIT (CLA-131).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 25.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that (a) before and after the resumption of sovereignty, the PRC, Hong Kong, and Macao have each entered into BITs with the *same* third States; (b) the territorial definition in the BITs clearly indicates that Macao and the Hong Kong SARs have the power to enter into BITs to cover their own territory notwithstanding that the PRC has also entered into BITs with the same third States. This indicates that the territorial limit of the PRC BITs are confined to Mainland China.112 The Respondent also points out that different forms of dispute resolution provisions have been resorted to by the PRC, Hong Kong and Macao.113\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 31-34 for the territorial definitions contained in the PRC, Hong Kong and Macao BITs, which the Respondent claims, show that irrespective of the timing of the BITs into which it has entered, the PRC has chosen to maintain the position set forth in the two Notifications and not to extend any BITs to Macao or Hong Kong.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\n75.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s submission that, if the PRC BITs would, by reason of the \"moving treaty frontiers\" rule, automatically extend to Macao and Hong Kong after the resumption of sovereignty, the PRC would not allow the SARs to enter into BITs with the same third States with which it has concluded treaties.114 Nor would that be necessary.115 It would lead to \"legal chaos\" for foreign investors in the PRC, Macao and Hong Kong.116\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that its interpretation of the 1999 Notification is consistent with the PRC\u2019s \"one country, two systems\" policy in that it aligns with the economic and legal independence of the Macao SAR from Mainland China.117 It contends, furthermore, that it is the position of the Claimant that contradicts this policy and would, in the long run, adversely affect the economic development of the SARs.118 The Respondent submits that the interests of Laos would not be affected by its position because Macao and Laos did not have a treaty prior to the handover in 1999.119\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 26.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 35.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 36.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent rebuts the Claimant\u2019s reliance on Gallagher & Shan for its interpretation on the grounds that: (a) the passage cited by the Claimant refers to the issue of \"treaty coverage on persons (and entities)\" which is different from the territorial coverage of a treaty; (b) the passage is based on the ICSID case of *Tza Yap Shum v. The Republic of Peru,* which stands for the proposition that investors should not be denied protection under Chinese BITs if the term \"autonomy\" in the Macao SAR Basic Law is properly construed, which under the circumstances of this case, supports the Respondent\u2019s position on the exception to the automatic extension of treaties; and (c) the decision in *Tza Yap Shum\u2014* which it notes has been severely criticized\u2014is distinguishable because it dealt with the issue of the nationality of a *natural* person, which is not an issue in the present case.120\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 37, referring to the Journal of World Investment & Trade, Volume 10, Number 6, December 2009, \"Queries to the Recent ICSID Decision on Jurisdiction *Upon the Case of Tza Yap Shum v.

The Claimant emphasizes that it is not the case that the customary rule in Article 29 of the VCLT applied only at the time the BIT was executed in 1993, and that its application is supplanted by Article 15 of the VCST for the purposes of determining the BIT\u2019s territorial scope in 1999 and thereafter. Rather, the Claimant asserts that the principle in Article 29 means generally that, *at any given time,* a State is bound by a treaty in respect of any territory of which it is sovereign. The application of the customary rule in Article 29 means that a territorial change after the entry into force of a treaty alters the treaty\u2019s frontiers going forward. (Claimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 14-18)\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 26.\n\n83.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the rule in Article 29 of the VCLT is reflected, in part, in Article 15 of the VCST.133 However, the Claimant contends that there is no evidence of the requisite consistent State practice or *opinio juris* to support the notion that all of the VCST\u2019s provisions reflect customary international law.134 In particular, the Claimant argues that the exceptions to the rule in Article 15 of the VCST that differ from the customary rule reflected in Article 29 of the VCLT cannot be considered to reflect customary international law.135 The Claimant notes that Laos and the PRC have not ratified the VCST.136\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 3; Hearing Transcript, pp. 73-74, 98, 161.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 28-32.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 3; Hearing Transcript, p. 74.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant states that even if the exceptions under Article 15 of the VCST applied as a matter of customary international law, which it denies, they would not preclude the automatic extension of the BIT to Macao in 1999.137 Article 15 looks only to the language and application of the Treaty and not to the internal constitutional arrangements in a given State.138 Moreover, the threshold for establishing the exceptions is a high one.139\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 44.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 35.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 36; Hearing Transcript, pp. 71-72.\n\n85.\n\nConcerning the first exception, the Claimant argues that the Treaty contains no territorial limits; nor does it limit the category or territorial origin of investors entitled to its protection.140\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 37.\n\n86.\n\nConcerning the second exception, the Claimant submits that the extension of the BIT to the Macao SAR is not incompatible with its object and purpose which is to \"encourage, protect and create favorable conditions for investment by investors of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contacting State[\u2026]\"141 In the Claimant\u2019s view, allowing Macanese investors to benefit from the protections of the BIT is fundamentally compatible with the object and purpose as is extending the protections of the BIT to foreign investors who have invested in what is indisputably part of the territory of the PRC.142\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 38, citing the Preamble of the Treaty.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 38.\n\n87.\n\nThird, the Claimant argues that including Macao within the scope of application of the BIT does not radically change the conditions for the Treaty\u2019s operation, because (a) the only change effected is that Laos must provide investors from Macao the same protection and guarantees required for investors from Mainland China;143 (b) this kind of change is simply the normal consequence of the application of the \"moving treaty frontiers\" rule and as such cannot constitute a \"radical change\"; if mere expansion were enough to constitute a \"radical change\", the exception would \"swallow\" the rule;144 (c) this applies also in the case of bilateral treaties which are not distinguished from multilateral treaties in Articles 29 of the VCLT or Article 15 of the VCST; the PRC was Laos\u2019s treaty partner before 1999, and it remains so afterwards.145\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 39.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 40; Hearing Transcript, p. 162.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. The Claimant distinguishes the present situation from that under the context of Article 34 of the VCST which deals with the case of \"Succession of States in Cases of Separation of Parts of a State\" and includes the same \"radical change of conditions for the operation of the treaty proviso as found in Article 15. There, the Claimant notes that \"the question is whether one or more completely new States will succeed, in whole or in part, to the predecessor\u2019s treaty obligations. In contrast, Article 15 applies where territory has been transferred from one State to another; accordingly, the States in question remain the same at all times, with the only change being that their territory is either enlarged or contracted. [...] Where there is the creation of a new State \u2018very different from itself,\u2019 the \u2018personal nature\u2019 of a bilateral treaty may very well be an issue, because continuity of the treaty obligations would force the treaty partner into a reciprocal relationship with the successor, a completely new entity to which it has not agreed to be bound. In contrast, in the Article 15 paradigm, the identity of both bilateral treaty parties remains the same at all time.\" (Claimant\u2019s emphasis).\n\n88.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it is uncontested between the Parties that there are two exceptions to Article 29 of the VCLT; namely that a \"different intention\" with regard to the territorial scope of the BIT \"appears from the Treaty\" or \"is otherwise established\".146 The Claimant argues that the Respondent carries the evidentiary burden of establishing the PRC\u2019s \"different intention\",147 which must be established by evidence providing a \"sufficient degree of certainty\" that would overcome the default position.148\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 231, referring to Karagiannis, \"Article 29, Convention of 1969\" in Corten & Klein **(\"Karagiannis\")** (CLA-100).\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Treaty does not provide for the territorial limitation of its application or otherwise express a \"different intention\" or an intention to depart from the default customary rule.149\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 13; Hearing Transcript, p. 77.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Preamble, Articles 7, 11 or 12 of the Treaty can be invoked to establish the first exception.150 It disputes the Respondent\u2019s position that the reference to domestic law in Article 12 of the Treaty is relevant to the territorial scope of the Treaty;151 Article 12 refers to \"internal legal procedures\" solely in the context of the entry into force of the Treaty but is silent on the application of the Treaty once effective, as well as on its territorial scope.152\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 77.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 78.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 235-236, referring to Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70; Hearing Transcript, p. 78.\n\n91.\n\nAlthough the BIT was signed in 1993, or six years prior to the handover of Macao from Portugal to the PRC, the Claimant contends that both Parties to the BIT were aware\u2014during both the negotiation and the conclusion of the BIT\u2014that the PRC would resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Macao in 1999.153 On this basis, the Claimant notes that either Party could have expressly excluded Macao from the scope of the BIT.154\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 237, referring to the Basic Law of the Macao SAR, Preamble (RE-09).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 237.\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimant relies upon the explicit exclusion of Hong Kong and Macao from the PRC/Russia BIT to show that the PRC adopts express language excluding its SARs from the territorial scope of treaties if it in fact has the intention to do so, which was not the case here.155\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 238, referring to Protocol to the PRC/Russia BIT (CLA-90); Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 13; Hearing Transcript, pp. 80, 163.\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimant contests the argument of the Respondent that the PRC did not have the jurisdiction to state the position of Macao at the time of concluding the Treaty, as it was signed before the handover.156 It contends that the PRC had the jurisdiction to state its *own* position on the future territorial scope of the Treaty.157 In response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Parties could not know in 1993 how the Joint Declaration would be effected as the negotiations relating to the handover were still being conducted at that time, the Claimant notes that the Joint Declaration had been in effect since 1987 and the parties knew that Chinese sovereignty would resume over Macao in 1993, which means that the PRC could have already provided for an exception to the \"moving treaty frontiers\" rule in the Treaty.158\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 14\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 14; Hearing Transcript, p. 81.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 15; Hearing Transcript, pp. 81-82.\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Laos has provided no evidence establishing the intention to exclude Macao from the scope of the BIT, or to demonstrate that a \"different intention\" has been \"otherwise established.\"159\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 24.\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s characterization of the 1999 Notification as a unilateral declaration that prevents the BIT from applying to Macao.160\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 241, referring to Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 38-59.\n\n96.\n\nFirst, the Claimant notes that the 1999 Notification applies only to multilateral treaties for which the UN Secretary-General is depositary.161 The PRC/Laos Treaty is a bilateral treaty that does not involve the UN Secretary-General in any capacity. Therefore, it is not surprising that it is not included in the list annexed to the 1999 Notification\u2014no bilateral investment treaties are included on the list\u2014,162 and the formalities for the application of a treaty to Macao as set out in Paragraph IV of the 1999 Notification do not apply to the Treaty.163 The Claimant contends that a contrary interpretation would effectively deny all investors from Macao and Hong Kong the protections enjoyed by their PRC counterparts, which would be incompatible with the purposes of both the investment treaty regime and the \"one country, two systems\" policy of the PRC.164\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 242, referring to UN Status of Multilateral Treaties (CLA-115);

Hearing Transcript, p. 86.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 21; Hearing Transcript, pp. 86-87.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 22 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis); Hearing Transcript, pp. 86-87.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 23.\n\n98.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that the manner in which the 1999 Notification is treated by the UN does not change its effect, the Claimant argues that to accept this, the Tribunal would effectively have to find that the UN somehow misrepresented the context of the PRC\u2019s communication.169 In any event, the Claimant submits that even within the text of the PRC\u2019s notification, reference is made to the UN Secretary-General\u2019s depositary function, which applies to multilateral instruments.170\n\nHearing Transcript, pp. 163-164.\n\nHearing Transcript, pp. 164-165.\n\n99.\n\nSecond, the Claimant contends that reservations do not apply to bilateral agreements since any valid reservation would necessarily modify the treaty for both parties.171 Thus, the alleged failure by Laos to object to the 1999 Notification is irrelevant.172 But even if reservations could apply to bilateral agreements, the Claimant notes that the 1999 Notification did not refer to the Treaty it purported to modify, and was not communicated directly to Laos, the other Contracting State.173 According to the Claimant, these are fundamental requirements attaching to treaty reservations under international law.174\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 25;

(b) paragraph 2.45 is not premised on *Tza Yap Shum;* and (c) paragraph 2.45 refers to the SAR \"investors\" generally and is not limited to investors who are natural persons.184\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 32 n. 52.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the fact that the PRC and Macao entered into two bilateral agreements with the same third States almost a decade after the BIT entered into force, cannot impact the application of the \"moving treaty frontiers\" rule to the BIT as of 1999.185 It is the Claimant\u2019s position that there is no evidence to suggest that the four treaties in question\u2014PRC/Portugal BIT (2005), PRC/Netherlands BIT (2001), Macao/Portugal BIT (2000), Macao/Netherlands BIT (2008)\u2014conflict or are mutually exclusive; to the contrary, the Claimant argues that they establish a complementary regime.186 The PRC treaties do not contain language referring to or carving out Macao and the later treaties do not contain language superseding the former treaties.187 This contrasts with the explicit carve-out contained in the PRC/Russia BIT with regard to the Macao and Hong Kong SARs.188\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 46; the Netherlands/Macao BIT (2008) (CLA-128); Portugal/Macao BIT (2000) (CLA-129); Netherlands/PRC BIT (2001) (CLA-130); Portugal/PRC BIT (2005) (CLA-131).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 47; see also Hearing Transcript, pp. 94-96.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 47.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 47.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimant characterizes the Macao/Netherlands and Macao/Portugal BITs as supplemental agreements that apply only in the territory of the Macao SAR.189 The only consequence of this supplemental regime is that Macanese investors can file for arbitration under the PRC or Macao treaty.190 Dutch or Portuguese investors complaining of breaches in Macao, however, can only bring claims against the PRC under the PRC treaties and against Macao under the Macao treaties.191 The same does not apply with respect to bringing claims against Macao under the PRC/Laos Treaty because there is no supplemental Laos treaty with Macao.192\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 48.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 49;

Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 32.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 50; the Claimant notes that there is a serious question over the ability of the SARs to conclude international agreements under international law that has yet to be tested. Accordingly, by denying investors from the SARs access to protection under the PRC treaties, SAR investors could be deprived of all protections (Claimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 51).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 32.\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the *Tza Yap Shum* decision in which the tribunal, after hearing evidence on the topic of the Hong Kong SAR\u2019s power to conclude investment treaties, found that there was nothing inconsistent between the parallel treaty regimes of Hong Kong and the PRC.196\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 51; Hearing Transcript, p. 96.\n\n109.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent\u2019s admission that the \"federal clause exception\" does not apply here resolves this issue.197 Alternatively, it contends that the rationale behind the \"federal clause exception\" is irrelevant to this case because this Treaty does not have a federal clause provision, thereby requiring the Tribunal to resort to the default rule of customary international law.198\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 251-252, referring to Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 81 where it states that \"[\u00b6\u00b6]ecause the PRC is a unitary state, the principles pertaining to the \u2018federal clause\u2019 exception, as traditionally understood, are not applicable.\"; Hearing Transcript, pp. 92-93.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 253, referring to Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 79; Karagiannis, p. 748 (CLA-100); ILC Commentary 1966, Commentary on Article 25, note 4, p. 213 (CLA-114).\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s characterization of the 1999 handover as a transfer of a dependent territory from one administrative power to another. According to the Claimant, the handover in fact represented the resumption by the PRC of the exercise of its sovereignty over Macao.199 But even were the Respondent\u2019s characterization of the 1999 handover accurate, which the Claimant denies, it states that the \"moving treaty frontiers\" rule would continue to apply by analogy.200\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 254, referring to Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 85.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 254, referring to the ILC Commentary 1974, p. 209 (RA-14).\n\n**B.** Whether Sanum qualifies as an investor under the Treaty\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1.

Whether the Claimant is an \"economic entity\"**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant does not meet the requirement of being an \"economic entity,\" as set forth in Article 1(2) of the BIT for the following reasons: (a) an \"economic entity\" must have economic or commercial activities within the PRC; (b) the BIT was not intended to protect shell companies like the Claimant; (c) the nationality of the \"economic entity\" is to be determined by whether its management seat and control are located within the PRC; and alternatively, (d) the BIT is not intended to protect the investments of non-Contracting States.219\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 101.\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent first notes that the requirement in the Treaty that an \"investor\" be an \"economic entity\" means that an entity must have economic activities related to the investment that is the subject of a claim in order to qualify as an investor. This evidences an intention to exclude mere shell companies from the definition of an \"investor.\"220\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 102-105.\n\n121.\n\nConcerning the nationality of the \"economic entity\", the Respondent first contends that, subject to the wording and interpretation of the Treaty, there are three criteria by which the nationality of a company can typically be determined: (a) place of incorporation; (b) seat or *siege social',* and (c) place of effective control.221\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the second criterion\u2014the seat or *siege social* \u2014pertains to the description of \"economic entity.\"222 According to the Respondent, this means that the place in which the economic activities are conducted must be the State in which the company is incorporated.223 It further argues that to allow a shell corporation to conduct its economic activities in third States and yet avail itself of the BIT protections of the State in which it is merely incorporated would be tantamount to treaty shopping, which the Contracting Parties did not intend to permit under the Treaty.224 Moreover, the economic activities must pertain to the investment that is the subject of the claim in question under the Treaty.225\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 108.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 109.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 109.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 110.\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the majority in *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine* which adopted a purposive interpretation of the BIT and meaning of \"investor\" under Article 1(2) of that treaty.226 The majority concluded that the treaty \"extended its protections to entities incorporated in third countries using the nationality of the individuals who controlled the enterprise (or the management seat of the entity that controlled the enterprise) to determine the nationality of the claimant.\"227 The Respondent notes that in construing the BIT preamble of that case, the tribunal found that the BIT was intended to \"create and maintain favourable conditions for the investment of investors of one state in the territory of the other,\"228 which shows that the tribunal did not limit its consideration to the place of incorporation.229 The Respondent argues that considering only the place of incorporation would be even less appropriate in this case, as the \"investor\" is defined as an \"economic entity.\"230\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 111, referring to *Tokios Tokeles v.

It contends that this contribution does not meet the requirement of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, which includes \"shares in companies or other forms of interest in such companies\" in its definition of investment.248\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 123.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 122.\n\n133.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s submission that its investment consists of \"investing in real property; employing its know-how and acquiring other tangible assets in order to establish and maintain gaming facilities described above, and in obtaining concessionfs] from the [Respondent which accorded its investment enterprises exclusive rights to operate gaming facilities in five provinces.\"249\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction,\u00b6124, referring to Amended Notice, \u00b6 115.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent first contests the Claimant\u2019s argument that it has invested in movable or immovable property assets in the territory of Laos, pursuant to Article 1 (1)(a) of the BIT, on the grounds that the said property rights belong not to Sanum but to the local companies that are to operate the gaming facilities.250\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 124-125, referring to Amended Notice, \u00b6 115.\n\n135.\n\nSecond, the Respondent notes that it cannot identify any \"know-how of Sanum employed in Lao PDR\" or \"other tangible assets\" that would meet the definition of an investment, and further notes that the \"concessions\" to which Sanum refers were actually accorded to its investment enterprise\u2014namely, Savan Vegas and Paksong Vegas, and not to it.251\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 126, referring to Amended Notice, \u00b6 115.\n\n136.\n\nLast, the Respondent contends that the two PDAs do not qualify as investments, because they replace existing PDAs (concluded on 11 April 2006 and amended on 26 July 2006) to which Sanum is not a party and from which Sanum cannot derive rights.252 Moreover, the Respondent notes that \"[n]o specific right was granted to Sanum under the PDAs,\" as the PDAs merely (a) express the intention of the Parties to cooperate on project development (Article 4, PDAs); (b) involve Laos granting development rights to both Sanum and ST (Article 2, PDAs); and (c) provide that the development project area is to be considered as part of the PDA \"after the company has completely developed the land area of 50 hectares allowed by the Government.\" (Article 2(2), PDAs).253\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 127.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 127.\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that the PDAs only contemplate the conclusion of future contracts upon the establishment of a joint venture (Article 6, PDAs) or a lease agreement for the concession area (Article 4(4), PDAs).254 It contends that the shareholders\u2019 rights, the gaming license, and lease agreement were granted not to the Claimant but to Savan Vegas and Paksong Vegas, the local vehicles.255\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 127.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 127.\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the rights arising out of the PDAs cannot be taken as \"claims for money or to any performance having an economic value (Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT),\" and that the PDAs themselves do not legitimately give rise to expectations regarding financial value because they do not guarantee the formation of a joint venture or the granting of a gaming license.256\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 127.\n\n**(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the text of the Treaty neither excludes indirect investments from its coverage nor provides a basis on which to distinguish between the operating entities and Sanum for the purposes of defining qualifying \"investments.\"257\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 273.

Article 8 of the BIT**\n---------------------------\n\n**(a) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the ordinary meaning of Article 8(3) establishes that Laos did not consent to the arbitration of Sanum\u2019s claims under the BIT.\n\n145.\n\nIt notes that Article 8(1) first imposes a six-month negotiation period on the parties.266 If the negotiation is unsuccessful, then the BIT assigns Laotian courts general jurisdiction to hear any dispute connected with the investment (Article 8(2))267 and an ad hoc arbitral tribunal the more specific jurisdiction of hearing only those \"dispute [s] involving the amount of compensation for expropriation\"268 and not \"dispute[s] involving expropriation.\"269\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 131-132; Hearing Transcript, pp. 33-35.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 35.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 132; Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 47; Hearing Transcript, pp. 35-36.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 47.\n\n146.\n\nAccordingly, it is the Respondent\u2019s position that all of the Claimant\u2019s other claims\u2014 *i.e.,* the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, expropriation, and breach of contract\u2014are excluded from these proceedings.\n\n147.\n\nIn reliance on Article 31(1) of the VCLT that requires a treaty to be interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of its terms, the Respondent contends that the Parties have consented to international arbitration only for the quantum of an expropriation, and are required by the BIT to submit all other disputes, including the issue of whether an expropriation has occurred in the first place, to the local courts of the host State.270 The Respondent relies on three arbitral tribunal decisions that have interpreted arbitration clauses in treaties providing for disputes on the \"amount of compensation\" only to be determined by international arbitration.271 The Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s argument on this matter requires a departure from and an enlargement of the actual wording of the text.272\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 133-135.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 133-135, relying on *Berschader v.

It notes that the PRC has committed to respecting the sovereignty of Laos in its ratification of the International Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos dated 23 July 1962.280 The Respondent also notes that preambles of other BITs signed by Laos, such as those with Australia and Indonesia, also refer to the principle of respect for the mutual independence and sovereignty of States.281\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 146, referring to the Department of State Bulletin, Vol. XLVII, No. 1207 dated 13 August 1962 (RE-13).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 147, referring to Preamble, Laos/Australia BIT signed on 6 April 1994 (RE-14) and Laos/Indonesia BIT signed on 18 October 1994 (RE-15).\n\n153.\n\nIt submits that several BITs signed by the PRC also refer to the principle of mutual respect of sovereignty,282 and limit the scope of arbitral jurisdiction to only those disputes involving the quantum of an expropriation claim while assigning the resolution of all other disputes to the local courts of the host State.283\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 148, referring to Preamble, the PRC/Mongolia BIT 1991 (RE-16) and Preamble, the PRC/Australia BIT 1988.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 148, referring to Article 8(3) of the PRC/Mongolia BIT 1991 (RE-16).\n\n154.\n\nThe Respondent cautions the Tribunal against relying on the findings of other arbitral tribunals or state courts that have interpreted narrow consent clauses broadly in order to allow the investor to arbitrate expropriation claims.284 The Respondent argues that none of the bilateral investment treaties in those cases incorporate the principle of mutual respect of sovereignty, as does the BIT here.285 The application of the principle of mutual respect of sovereignty obliges the Tribunal to respect the Contracting States\u2019 choice of submitting disputes of a foreign investor to local courts.286\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 149; Hearing Transcript, pp. 39-41, referring to *Renta 4 S.V.S.A et al. v.

(In this way, the Respondent seeks to distinguish the findings of the tribunal in *Tza Yap Shum.* That tribunal, the Respondent says, was motivated to interpret the jurisdictional clause broadly because it contained a fork-in-the-road provision such that if an investor submitted its dispute on the principle of expropriation to a local court, it was barred from access to international arbitration on the quantum of expropriation. The Respondent argues that this is not the case under the PRC/Laos Treaty).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 151-154; Hearing Transcript, pp. 43-45.\n\n**(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 8(3) of the Treaty.\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimant relies on *Tza Yap Shum,* which contains language similar to that of the BIT.290 There, the tribunal found that the phrase \"dispute involving the amount of compensation for expropriation\" (as set out in Article 8(3) of the Treaty) simply meant that the dispute must *include* the determination of the amount of compensation but must not necessarily be limited to it.291 The tribunal noted that the phrase evinced that the parties had consented to arbitrate all issues pertinent to the determination of the amount of damages, which necessarily includes whether damages must be awarded at all.292\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 281; Hearing Transcript, pp. 123-125; *Tza Yap Shum* (CLA-70/RA-10).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 281, referring to Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 134; *Tza Tap Shum* (CLA-79).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction,\u00a0\u00b6 281.\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant contends that this interpretation is consistent with the language of Article 4(1) of the Treaty, which sets out standards for the determination of whether an expropriation has taken place. It is thus clear, the Claimant argues, that whether an expropriation has occurred is an assessment that is a necessary element of any claim \"involving the amount of compensation for expropriation.\"293 The Claimant submits that the term \"involving\" is broad and extends the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction beyond disputes in which the only point of dispute is quantum.294\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 281; *Tza Tap Shum,* \u00b6 152 (CLA-79/RA-10); Hearing Transcript, p. 117.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 117.\n\n160.\n\nThe Claimant argues that a contrary interpretation would render Article 4(1) meaningless, because the standards set out in Article 4(1) for determining an unlawful expropriation do not strictly fit within a dispute restricted to the amount or quantum of damages.295 The Claimant further notes that, contrary to the contention of the Respondent, there can be no distinction between the question of whether the investor received \"appropriate and effective compensation\" under Article 4(2) and the question of whether an expropriation occurred under Article 4(1), as the former is an element of the latter.296 The Claimant further points out that clauses like Article 4(1) and 4(2)\u2014variants of which can be found in many investment arbitration treaties, including those with broad dispute resolution provisions\u2014do not relate to the forum for making expropriation claims but merely set out the conditions for lawful expropriation and the standard for compensation.297\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 282.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 283; Hearing Transcript, pp. 119-120.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 39; Hearing Transcript, p. 120.\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that Article 8(1) and 8(2) of the BIT do not have the effect of designating the local courts as the exclusive forum for the resolution of disputes apart from the quantum of expropriation, as the Respondent claims, because Article 8(1) provides for the amicable settlement of disputes and Article 8(2) gives the parties the option of submitting the dispute to the courts of the host State after the designated waiting period.298\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction,\u00a0\u00b6 38.\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimant cites to courts and tribunals that have interpreted treaty provisions similar to Article 8(3) to confer jurisdiction over the question of whether an expropriation has occurred.299\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 284; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 36, citing: (1) *Tza Yap Shum,* at 151 (CLA-70/RA-10); (2) *European Media Ventures,* \u00b6 44 (RA-22) (see also Hearing Transcript, pp. 128-129); (3) *Quasar de Valors (formerly Renta 4 S.V.S.A. et al.) v.

Concerning the Respondent\u2019s reliance on (1) *Austrian Airlines,* the Claimant notes that unlike the Treaty in this case, the BIT in that case explicitly stated that an investor could only challenge an expropriation before the local authorities (RA-20) (see also Hearing Transcript, p. 130); (2) *Berschader,* the Claimant notes that the panel had considered the phrase \"amount or mode of compensation\" after it had already concluded that it lacked jurisdiction on an entirely separate ground and its conclusions on the scope of the arbitration clause were \u2018superfluous\u2019 *obiter dicta* (see also Hearing Transcript, pp. 130-131) (RA-18); and, (3) *Roslnvest,* the Claimant notes, *inter alia,* that that decision did not consider whether the word \u2018payment\u2019 may lead to consideration of the reality of its predicate: \u2018expropriation\u2019 (RA-19); see also Hearing Transcript, pp. 131-132.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 129.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 280-284; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 36; see also Hearing Transcript, p. 129.\n\n164.\n\nFurther, the Claimant argues that the interpretation of the Respondent disregards the context of Article 8(3).304 The Claimant submits that a proper reading of Article 8(2) of the PRC/Laos Treaty is that an investor is entitled to submit its dispute to the State courts, but that it will be barred from seeking arbitration of its expropriation claim if it in fact pursues this option.305 The Claimant asserts that the Respondent\u2019s contention that an investor must first submit the issue of whether an expropriation has occurred to the domestic courts effectively deprives the investor of access to arbitration; its opportunity to arbitrate the dispute will be foreclosed by its submission of the issue of expropriation to the domestic courts.306\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 287-288.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 287-288.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 289, referring to *Tza Yap Shum,* \u00b6\u00b6 154- 161 (CLA-70/RA-10).\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Article 8(2) and 8(3) provide an investor two options if the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation within six months.307 Article 8(3) contains a fork-in-the-road provision.308 The Claimant asserts that had the Contracting Parties intended to require the investor to litigate whether an expropriation had occurred before submitting the question of quantum to a tribunal, they would not have stipulated that *\"either\"* process could begin after six months.309\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 290.\n\nHearing Transcript, pp. 117, 120.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 290.\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimant also disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s contention that the fork-in-the-road bar in Article 8(3) merely precludes an investor who has submitted a dispute over the quantum of compensation to a domestic court from bringing the same claim before an arbitral tribunal.310 First, the Claimant notes that Article 8(3) categorically states that arbitration shall not be permitted if the investor has submitted the dispute \"involving the amount of compensation for expropriation\" to the local courts; a statement that can only make sense if Article 8 permits an investor to choose between litigating and arbitrating all aspects of its expropriation claim.311\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 291, referring to Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 151-154.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 292; Hearing Transcript, pp. 121-122.\n\n167.\n\nSecond, the Claimant notes that the determination of the fact of an expropriation and the amount of compensation for an expropriation are linked in the Treaty, so that a court could not determine one issue without also determining the other.312\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 293.\n\n168.\n\nThird, the Claimant contends that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation renders the right to arbitration illusory, which in turn defeats the object of the Treaty to encourage investment.313\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 294, referring to *Tza Yap Shum,* \u00b6 153 (CLA-70/RA-10); *Roslnvest,* \u00b6 130 (RA-19); *Amco v.

Hearing Transcript, p. 48.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 159, referring to *Roslnvest,* \u00b6 110 (RA-19); Hearing Transcript, pp. 151-152 (referring to *Tza Yap Shum,* \u00b6 126) and pp. 152-153 (referring to *Roslnvest* and the distinction made in that case between investments or investors in applying the MFN clause).\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent argues that \"fair and equitable and full protection and security\" clause is a standard term in most modem BITs that has appeared in such treaties since the 19th century, including in the first Chinese model BIT and other BITs contemporary to that at issue here.322 The Respondent stresses that the term \"protection\" refers to the \"protection and security\" standard.323 The Respondent therefore concludes that the scope of the MFN clause is restricted to Article 3(1), which is \"fair and equitable treatment\" with the \"protection\" indicated therein having no relation to access to international arbitration.324\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 50.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 51, referring to Gallagher & Shan, pp. 134-135 (RA-34); Hearing Transcript, p. 151.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 53; Hearing Transcript, pp. 49-50.\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the context of Article 3(2) confirms its non-application to dispute settlement.325 The specific reference in Article 3(2) to Article 3(1) manifests the clear intention of the Contracting States that \"the MFN clause would import only [the] more favorable substantive treatments from third-party treaties, and not arbitration or other dispute resolution provisions.\"326\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 161.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 162.\n\n175.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, Article 3(2) would have specifically referred to Article 8 if the Contracting States\u2019 intention was to be able to import an arbitration clause from another treaty to expand the consent in Article 8(3) of the BIT, which is not the case here.327 The Respondent therefore contends that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is limited to that specified in Article 8(3) of the BIT.328\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 162.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 162.\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty, as referenced in both the Preamble and Article 8(7) of the BIT, precludes the expansive interpretation of the MFN clause.329 The Respondent contends that abroad application of the MFN to enlarge access to arbitration would directly violate the agreement of the Contracting States to limit the scope of permissible arbitration.330\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 163-164.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 165.\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that the Contracting Parties assigned disputes of the kind brought by the Claimant exclusively to the courts of the Contracting States, pursuant to Article 8(2) of the BIT.331 To allow the Claimant to import broader consent clauses that would allow it to arbitrate claims for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, breach of contract, and liability for expropriation, would circumvent the Contracting States\u2019 agreement on this matter.332\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 165.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 166.\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that \"an MFN clause cannot change the scope, *ratione materiae,* of the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal.\"333 The Respondent distinguishes this case from other cases in which the consent clauses were broader than that found in Article 8(3) and over which the tribunals had *ratione materiae* jurisdiction for all of the disputes brought by the claimant.334\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 167, referring to *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17), Decision on Jurisdiction, June 21, 2011, Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Brigitte Stern ***(\"Impregilo\")*** (RA-24).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 167, referring to *Impregilo* (RA-24).\n\n**(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the MFN clause of Article 3(2) extends the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to claims for the breach of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment, as enshrined in Article 3(1); the guarantee of free transfer of payments in Article 5; and other protections that are imported from more favorable bilateral investment treaties, including the Claimant\u2019s right to have its expropriation claim resolved through international arbitration.335\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 297; Hearing Transcript, p. 132.\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s contention that any right imported through Article 3(1) is limited to the substantive entitlements in Article 3(1), thereby excluding dispute settlement.336\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 298.\n\n181.\n\nFirst, the Claimant contends that the \"protection\" that Article 3(1) accords to investments extends to all protections provided in the Treaty\u2014including access to international arbitration\u2014 and not merely substantive ones.337 Moreover, Article 3(2) promises no less favorable treatment and protection for \"activities associated with such investments.\" The Claimant argues that the settlement of disputes is an \"activity\" associated with an investment.338 The Claimant further argues that arbitration clauses are highly valued by investors and are considered essential to the range of protection offered in investment treaties.339\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 299-300. The Claimant also argues that such a reading is consistent with the Preamble to the Treaty which includes the protection of investment as one of its primary purposes.

It argues that the principle underlying the decisions of those tribunals applies here, *i.e.,* that the less favorable treatment bestowed on the Claimant by the Respondent has been prejudicial and has effectively foreclosed access to international arbitration.343\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 303-304, referring to *Roslnvest,* \u00b6\u00b6 126, 130, 136 (RA-19); *Maffezini v.

The Respondent contends that this \"duplication of claims submitted before two separate Tribunals must be procedurally barred.\"348 In its view, prior to the submission of the Amended Notice, the claims were separate, and their incorporation in this arbitration has caused the Respondent prejudice in its selection of arbitrators and the preparation of its defenses.349\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 168.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 168; Hearing Transcript, pp. 153-154.\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Lao Holdings was specifically created to own Sanum so that two BIT arbitrations could be filed against the Respondent.350 The Respondent notes that it rejected the Claimant\u2019s efforts to consolidate the two arbitrations.351 That the Claimant now seeks to consolidate these cases by importing its claims in the Lao Holdings Arbitration into this arbitration is a \"patent abuse of process.\"352\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 169.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 169.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 169.\n\n188.\n\nSecond, the Respondent notes that the doctrine of *lis pendens* prevents identical claims from being brought against the same party.353 The Respondent argues that it should not be forced to defend the same claims twice before different arbitral tribunals.354 The Respondent notes that the procedural timetables of both arbitrations provide for defenses to be raised at separate times.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 170; Hearing Transcript, pp. 52-53.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 170.\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the inequality and inefficiency of the Respondent having to defend a different argument based on different evidence in the later proceedings as the Claimant would be able to modify its argument based on the defense of the Respondent in the earlier proceedings.355\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 170.\n\n190.\n\nLastly, the Respondent maintains that procedural equality prevents the Claimant from having \"two bites at the cherry,\" and notes that the rule of *lis pendens* has as its primary purpose the prevention of dual verdicts on the same claims.356\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 171-172, referring to Born, *International Commercial Arbitration,* Vol. II, Wolters Kluwer, page 2949 [2009] **(\"Born\")** (RA-25).\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent then notes that \"[n]ow that Claimant Sanum has spelled out in 170 pages its full amendments, [it] further objects under Articles 17 and 22 of the UNCITRAL Rules and requests that the arbitrator deny the amendments.\"357 By way of providing context to this claim, it reiterates that Lao Holdings was specifically created in January 2012 to enable the Claimant to avail of the protections accorded under the Netherlands/Laos BIT,358 and that Lao Holdings made untrue statements in order to ensure that the ICSID tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to decide its claims.359 It characterizes the amendment of the Claimant\u2019s claims in this case as a further \"attempt to manipulate the investment arbitration system.\"360\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 7-10.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 11.\n\n192.\n\nIn response to the contention of the Claimant that it had to amend its Notice because of the refusal of the Respondent to consolidate the two cases, the Respondent notes that the requested amendment was not to enhance efficiency but was intended, rather, to transfer claims arising under the Netherlands/Laos BIT to this case.361\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 12.\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent highlights that Article 17 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules allows the Tribunal to avoid \"unnecessary delay and expense and to provide a fair and efficient process\"362 and that Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Rules allows the Tribunal to reject an amendment that causes \"delay\" and \"prejudice.\"363 The Respondent points to the effort exerted and costs incurred in the Lao Holdings Arbitration, and notes that the Claimant had sought the production of documents in this case to be used in the Lao Holdings Arbitration.364\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; Hearing Transcript, p. 53.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 17.\n\n194.\n\nIt also notes that Article 22 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules prevents an amendment in this case because this amendment falls outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, as shown by (a) the initial decision of the Claimant to file separate claims under the Netherlands/Laos BIT and the PRC-Laos BIT, respectively; and (b) the allegedly limited scope of the PRC/Laos BIT, which the Respondent claims applies only to claims regarding the quantum of expropriation.365 As further proof of the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the claims the Claimant wishes to introduce in this arbitration, the Respondent points to an allegedly private dispute\u2014between Sanum and its local partner\u2014that it contends does not belong in an investment arbitration.366\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19; Hearing Transcript, p. 53.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 20.\n\n**(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the doctrine of *lis pendens* is inapplicable in this case because there is no identity of parties and claims in the two cases.367 It further submits that *lis pendens* provides a ground for staying one proceeding until the other has terminated. It argues that there are no grounds to support a stay in this case as the resolution of one case will not resolve the other and, moreover; the simultaneous conduct of both cases actually enhances efficiency.368\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction,\u00a0\u00b6 310, referring to *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, December 8, 2001, \u00b6\u00b6 89-89 (CLA-10); Hearing Transcript, p. 141.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 310, referring to Born, at 2933 (RA-25).\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Claimant is committing an abuse of process. It argues that Laos chose to have two separate proceedings in this case; Sanum had proposed to consolidate the proceedings prior to the selection of arbitrators in both cases.369 It notes that Laos has benefited from seeing the Claimant\u2019s detailed arguments in both proceedings before having to file its defense.370 The Claimant also argues that the two claimant parties have the right to bring claims under two different treaties as they are from different States and have separate rights under the treaties.371\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 311; Hearing Transcript, pp. 139, 141, 172-173.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 311.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 140.\n\n197.\n\nFinally, the Claimant contends that the amendment of its Notice to include claims in the Lao Holdings arbitration could not have prejudiced the Respondent in its selection of arbitrators, given that Laos has been able to appoint the same arbitrator in both proceedings.372 The Claimant also points out that the amendment of its Notice was discussed at the first procedural hearing, agreed upon by the Parties, and memorialized by the Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. I.373\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction,\u00a0\u00b6 311; the Claimant also submits that it attempted to have the same tribunal constituted to hear the two cases (Hearing Transcript, pp. 139, 140).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 46, referring to Procedural Order No. 1, at 4; Hearing Transcript, p. 140.\n\n198.\n\nAs to the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Amended Notice should be rejected pursuant to 2010 UNCITRAL Rules 17 and 22, the Claimant raises four points. First, the Claimant contends that this argument is untimely, given that Laos did not object to this amendment when the process for this amendment was discussed and adopted, when the allegedly detailed Amended Notice was filed, or when the Respondent filed its Response on Jurisdiction.374 The Claimant insists that \"Laos cannot complain of an \u2018abuse of process\u2019 when it agreed to the process.\"375\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 48; Hearing Transcript, p. 142.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 48.\n\n199.\n\nSecond, the Claimant asserts that the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules neither prohibit nor require that a notice of arbitration be amended prior to the presentation of a claimant\u2019s case in the opening memorial, and argues that Article 22 typically applies not to the notice of arbitration, but to the adding or supplementing of claims after the submission of the claim or counterclaim.376\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 49.\n\n200.\n\nThird, the Claimant notes that neither its Amended Notice nor its Statement of Claim has caused unfairness, prejudice, or delay; both submissions predated the Respondent\u2019s filing of any pleadings in this matter.377 As to the Respondent\u2019s claims concerning the Lao Holdings Arbitration, the Claimant contends that the Respondent\u2019s work in that case need not be duplicated and is in fact directly applicable to the present matter.378 The Claimant also points out that any inefficiency or added costs resulting from the parallel litigation can be attributed to the refusal of the Respondent to consolidate the two arbitrations.379\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 50.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 50.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 51.\n\n201.\n\nFourth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent has not explained its argument under Article 22, that the Lao Holdings claims fall outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, and questions the relevance of what it describes as the Respondent\u2019s speculation as to why the Claimant filed two separate arbitrations.380\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 52.\n\n**VI. RELIEF REQUESTED**\n------------------------\n\n202.\n\nThe Respondent requests that:\n\ni) The Tribunal decline jurisdiction because Sanum is not a qualified investor under the BIT.\n\nii) The Tribunal decline jurisdiction because the claims brought are not investment related claims.\n\niii) The Tribunal decline jurisdiction because the Respondent did not consent to arbitrate Sanum\u2019s claims under the BIT.\n\niv) In the alternative, the Tribunal dismisses the several claims introduced into this arbitration by the Amended Notice filed 7 June 2013, incorporating the duplicative claims previously made in the Holdings arbitration.\n\nv) The Tribunal issue an award of the Respondent\u2019s costs incurred in connection with this arbitration, including Laos\u2019 legal fees and other costs, and Laos\u2019 share of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Administrative Centre.\n\n203.\n\nThe Claimant requests an award:\n\ni) Dismissing the Respondent\u2019s objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in their entirety;\n\nii) Awarding Sanum its costs and expenses of this proceeding, including attorneys\u2019 fees, in an amount to be determined in the course of this proceeding by such means as the Tribunal may direct; and\n\niii) Ordering such other relief as may be just and appropriate in the circumstances.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A.** Applicable law\n---------------------\n\n204.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that public international law is the applicable law. It is also undisputed that the VCLT is binding upon Laos and the PRC.\n\n**B. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT IS COVERED BY THE TREATY**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Whether the Treaty extends to the Macao SAR**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe question of the application or non-application of the PRC/Laos BIT to the Macao SAR is central to the question of jurisdiction. The Claimant considers that it applies, while the Respondent argues that it does not. If the Respondent is correct, the case stops as the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction and would not need to examine the other objections to jurisdiction. If the Claimant is correct, the Tribunal must continue its mission by examining the other objections to jurisdiction.\n\n**(a) The theoretical analysis of the relevance of the 1999 Notification to the Secretary-General of the UN**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nOne of the main arguments relied upon by the Respondent is that the 1999 Notification to the UN Secretary-General contains the list of treaties that the PRC intended to extend to the Macao SAR. In the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, it states:\n\nSimilarly, the 1999 Notification regarding the Macao SAR, which the PRC filed on 13 December 1999 and on which Lao PDR has been relying, provides:\n\n***\"[...] IV.***  ***With respect to other treaties that are not listed in the Annexes to this Note, to which the People\u2019s Republic of China is or*** will ***become a Party, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China will go through separately the necessary formalities for their application to the Macao Special Administrative Region if it so decided******.\"***\n\nThe BIT is not listed in the two Annexes referred to in the 1999 Notification. Thus, it was not extended to the Macao SAR.381\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42 (Respondent\u2019s emphasis).\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimant has answered this argument by underlining that it ignores an important difference between multilateral treaties and bilateral treaties:\n\n[...] on its face, the Notification did not intend to cover the universe of international agreements to which the PRC is a party. Rather, as is evident from the official record, the Notification applied only to multilateral treaties for which the UN Secretary-General acts as depositary: \"By a notification dated 13 December 1999, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China informed the Secretary-General of *the status of Macao in relation to treaties deposited with the Secretary-General.\"* The PRC-Laos Treaty, however, is not such an instrument: it is a bilateral treaty with regard to which the Secretary-General plays no role. Thus, contrary to what Respondent argues, no conclusion about the territorial scope of the Treaty can be drawn from the fact that it does not appear in the lists, annexed to the Notification, of multilateral PRC treaties that would apply to Macau after the handover. In fact, none of the PRC\u2019s numerous bilateral agreements (or multilateral agreements with other depositaries) is included in those annexes, because there was no reason to notify the Secretary-General of purported territorial limitations for treaties where he plays no role.382\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 242 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis).\n\n208.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent tried to explain that there is no difference between multilateral and bilateral treaties383 as can be seen from the fact that the bilateral treaties are also published in the UNTS, and to support this line of argument, it cited Article 102 of the UN Charter, which provides:\n\n1. Every treaty and every international agreement entered into by any Member of the United Nations after the present Charter comes into force shall as soon as possible be **registered** with the Secretariat and **published** by it.\n\n2. No party to any such treaty or international agreement which has not been registered in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article may invoke that treaty or agreement before any organ of the United Nations.384\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 42; Notes verbales from the Legal Counsel relating to the depositary practice and the registration of treaties pursuant to Article 102 of the UN Charter, http://treaties.un.org/Pages/Overview.aspx?path=overview/definition/pagel en.xml#agreements (emphasis added) (RA-30).\n\nUN Charter: Chapter XVI: Miscellaneous Provisions (RA-28) (emphasis addded).\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal must, however, emphasize that such an approach ignores the fundamental difference between the role of the UN as depositary and its role as an instance of registration. The role as depositary concerns exclusively multilateral treaties; the role as instance of registration concerns bilateral treaties. In both situations, the UN ensures the publication of the treaties. It is not because multilateral treaties and bilateral treaties are all published in the UNTS that the roles played upwards by the UN are not to be differentiated. When acting as depositary, the UN Secretary-General plays an important role as far as reservations to multilateral treaties are concerned, while no question of reservation arises in relation to bilateral treaties.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot therefore accept this line of argument by the Respondent. The Tribunal finds that the 1999 Notification has no relevance as far as bilateral treaties are concerned. As such, it does not need to enter into an examination of the Respondent\u2019s arguments to the effect that the 1999 Notification could be considered either as a reservation to the application of Article 29 of the VCLT or as a binding unilateral declaration according to which the PRC/Laos BIT\u2014not being mentioned among the multilateral treaties listed therein\u2014is not applicable to the Macao SAR.\n\n211.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s reliance on the 1999 Notification being of no avail, the Tribunal must analyze the legal parameters that are applicable in this case.\n\n**(b) The relevance of Article 29 of the VCLT and Article 15 of the VCST**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Parties\u2019 Positions*\n------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe Parties have invoked both Article 29 of the VCLT and Article 15 of the VCST.\n\n213.\n\nAs the written and oral submission of the Parties were far from exhaustive on these Articles, at the end of the Hearing on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal sought clarification from the Parties on the following point:\n\nThe respective roles, if any, of Article 29 of the [VCLT] and Article 15 of the [VCST] in relation to the application or non-application of the PRC/Laos Treaty to the Macau SAR.\n\n214.\n\nIt is useful to reproduce here these two articles. Article 29 of the VCLT reads as follows:\n\n**Article 29 - Territorial Scope of Treaties**\n\nUnless a different intention **appears from the treaty** or **is otherwise established** **,** a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory, (emphasis added)\n\n215.\n\nArticle 15 of the VCST reads as follows:\n\n**Article 15 - Succession In Respect of Part of Territory**\n\nWhen part of the territory of a State, or when any territory for the international relations of which a State is responsible, not being part of the territory of that State, becomes part of the territory of another State:\n\n(a) treaties of the predecessor State cease to be in force in respect of the territory to which the succession of States relates from the date of the succession of States; and\n\n(b) treaties of the successor State are in force in respect of the territory to which the succession of States relates from the date of the succession of States, unless it **appears from the treaty** or **is otherwise established** that the application of the treaty to that territory would be incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty or would radically change the conditions for its operation, (emphasis added)\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondent summarizes its position on the respective roles of Articles 15 and 29 as follows:\n\nRespondent submits its analysis on Question I in two parts. The first part establishes that Article 15 of the [VCST] is an expression of customary international law (A). The second part establishes that both Article 29 and Article 15 are applicable to this case as they are both expressions of customary international law and their co-existence is not incompatible (B).385\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post Hearing Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\n217.\n\nThe conclusion of the Respondent\u2019s analysis is that:\n\n[...] there can be no doubt that bilateral investment treaties and other commercial treaties concluded by China with third countries do not automatically apply to Macao under the positive aspect of the basic rule but are instead the object of an exception to such rule.386\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post Hearing Submission, \u00b6 21.\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimant, for its part, argues the following:\n\nArticle 29 is applicable to the PRC-Laos Treaty both because the PRC and Laos are parties to the VCLT and because Article 29 undeniably represents the applicable rule of customary international law. In contrast, neither the PRC nor Laos has ratified the [VCST], [...] [T]here is no evidence of the requisite consistent State practice or *opinio juris* to support the notion that its provisions reflect customary international law. In particular, the aspect of Article 15 of the [VCST] that differs from the customary rule reflected in Article 29\u2014its exceptions\u2014cannot be considered to reflect customary international law. [...] Even if the exceptions in Article 15 were somehow deemed to constitute applicable law, the PRC-Laos Treaty does not fall under its exceptions.387\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6.\n\n*The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n-------------------------\n\n219.\n\nIt is common ground that both the PRC and Laos are parties to the VCLT. It is also common ground that neither the PRC nor Laos are parties to the VCST. The customary nature of Article 15 is controversial between the Parties: they both accept that the general rule of the \"moving treaty frontiers\" of Article 15 of the VCST is customary, but the Claimant argues that the exceptions to Article 15 are not customary.\n\ni) Both Article 29 of the VCLT and Article 15 of the VCST are rules of customary international law\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nIt is undisputed by the Parties that Article 29 in its entirety has the force of binding customary international law.388 As this is not controversial the Tribunal does not consider that it needs to make lengthy developments to support this statement of law.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 2; Claimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 228-232; Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; Hearing Transcript, pp. 14:1-22; 71:1-73:14.\n\n221.\n\nBy contrast, although there is unanimity or \"quasi-unanimity\" among the doctrine to consider that Article 15 also represents customary international law, in view of the diverging analyses presented by the Parties, the Tribunal will elaborate at some length on this question.\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that the ILC, in its 1974 Commentary on Draft Article 14 (which became Article 15) of the VCST, is explicit that the \"moving treaty frontiers\" rule was a preexisting customary rule.389 In the same sense, Mr. Yasseen, the president of the ILC Drafting Committee that prepared the text of the VCST, declared: \"This principle is a generally recognized principle of international law; it is observed in the practice of States and can be considered as part of customary international law.\"390\n\nILC Commentary 1974, at pp. 208-209 (RA-13); see also Hearing Transcript, pp. 158-160, 169-170.\n\nYasseen, \"La Convention de Vienne sur la succession d'Etats en mati\u00e8re de trait\u00e9s,\" AFDI, 1978, at p. 92 (RA-40).

Les r\u00e8gles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles existent des controverses doctrinales\",393 but that others clearly have customary value: \"III. Les r\u00e8gles des Conventions qui ont ind\u00e9niablement une valeur coutumi\u00e8re\".394 Among the latter was included: \"la r\u00e8gle coutumi\u00e8re de la variabilit\u00e9 des limites territoriales d\u2019application des traites\"395.\n\nCahier, pp. 73-74 (RA-39) [English translation provided by the Tribunal, the original French being: \"[...] correspond \u00e0 la pratique des Etats, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 sans changement par la Conf\u00e9rence et il ne fait que codifier une r\u00e8gle coutumi\u00e8re.\"]\n\nStern, *La succession d\u2019Etats,* Hague Academy of International Law Collected Courses, t. 262, 2000 **(\"Stern\")** (CLA-140).

[English translation from French: \"The customary international law rule of the moving treaty frontiers\".]\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimant has admitted that Article 15 is customary as far as the general rule is concerned but submits that the exceptions are not customary. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not provided any reason in support of this position and the Tribunal has found no indication that such a dichotomy can be made; the doctrine on the customary character of Article 15 has never made such distinction but has referred to the rule as a whole.\n\nii) The rules are not incompatible, but merely deal with different moments in the evolution of a situation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nArticle 15 explains and regulates what happens at the moment of transition from one sovereign to another whereas Article 29 prescribes what the general situation is outside of a transitional period, whether a territory has undergone a transition or not. In other words, the rule of Article 15 can correctly be described as the \"moving treaty frontiers\" rule. The rule of Article 29 does not deal with a situation of change,396 but only states the general principle of international law related to the territorial extension of a State\u2019s sovereignty, which can be described as the principle of the territorial application of a State\u2019s legal order.\n\nSee for example, Odendahl, p. 489 : \"[...] questions of State succession are not covered by Article 29.\" (CLA-102). See, in the same sense, Doehring, The Scope of the Territorial Application of Treaties: Comments on Article 25 of the ILC\u2019s 1966 Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties (1967) 27 *Z.a.o.R.V.* 483, pp. 488-489: \"The draft [Article 25 that became Article 29] gives no answer as to the legal situation created when, in the course of the application of a treaty, a change occurs in the national boundaries of a State.\" (CLA-133).\n\n226.\n\nOf course, this does not mean that the two rules do not have an extremely close relationship, which explains why they were not always clearly distinguished by the Parties. The situation described in Article 29 can be the result of the application of Article 15, or, it can also be seen the other way around, *i.e.,* that Article 15 regulates the transition in the way it does, because this is the normal result of the territorial application of the law. This was indeed emphasized in The Hague Academy course on State Succession already mentioned:\n\nThis rule [Article 15] is but an application, in a given succession process, namely the transfer of a portion of territory between two States which remain in existence, of the general principle on the territorial application of treaties or, in other words, of the rules on the distribution of competences among States.397\n\nStern, p. 169. [English translation provided by the Tribunal, the original French being: \"Cette r\u00e8gle n\u2019est que la mise en oeuvre, dans un processus successoral sp\u00e9cifique, le transfert d\u2019un territoire entre deux Etats dont chacun reste identique \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, du principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019application territoriale des trait\u00e9s, autrement dit des r\u00e8gles de r\u00e9partition des comp\u00e9tences entre Etats.\"]\n\n227.\n\nThis is also indicated by the ILC, when discussing the draft article that was to become Article 15:\n\nAs to the rationale of the rule, it is sufficient to refer to the principle embodied in article 29 of the [VCLT] under which, unless a different intention is established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory. This means generally that at any given time a State is bound by a treaty in respect of any territory of which it is sovereign, but is equally not bound in respect of territory which it no longer holds.398\n\nILC Commentary 1974, p. 208(3) (RA-13).\n\n228.\n\nIn other words, the two rules exist side-by-side, Article 15 being the corollary of Article 29 and Article 29 being a consequence of Article 15.\n\niii) The exceptions to Article 15 of the VCST are encompassed in the exceptions to Article 29 of the VCLT\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThis close relationship explains indeed why the exceptions to the two rules are in fact very similar\u2014contrary to what the Claimant argued\u2014as can be seen from what has been emphasized in the two Articles in paragraphs 214 and 215 above.\n\n230.\n\nIn both Articles, the non-application of a treaty to the whole territory can only result from the treaty itself or if it is otherwise established. The reasons for the non-application of a treaty to an expanded territory at the moment of a succession are more limited than the reasons for the nonapplication of a treaty to the entire territory, but are included in them. Indeed, automatic succession applies unless it appears from the treaty itself or is otherwise established that such a result would not be appropriate *for one of two reasons:* either because such succession would be incompatible with the object and the purpose of the treaty or because it would radically change the conditions of its operation. As far as the non-application of a treaty to the whole territory is concerned, it is sufficient that such non-application results from the treaty or, *for whatever reason,* the State sees fit to decide such non-application: for example, the PRC and the Russian Federation decided that the PRC/Russia BIT would not apply to the Macao SAR, for no stated reason.\n\n231.\n\nThis analysis means that in order to ascertain whether or not the PRC/Laos BIT applies to the Macao SAR, Article 15 of the VCST with its exceptions as well as Article 29 of the VCLT with its exceptions\u2014which are two faces of the same coin\u2014are relevant.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the concrete situation of the PRC/Laos BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nA first remark to be made by the Tribunal is the difficulty it faced in ascertaining the application or non-application of the PRC/Laos BIT to the Macao SAR due to the paucity of factual elements presented by the Parties: there were no affidavits from the PRC, Laos or the Macao SAR, which could probably have been obtained from the respective authorities.\n\n233.\n\nMoreover, the response to a question raised by a member of the Tribunal during the Hearing on Jurisdiction did not clarify the matter. The question was the following:\n\nSo, my question is: Has there been any negotiation, any list of bilateral treaties? I\u2019m very surprised that this does not exist [...]399\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 56:23-25.\n\n234.\n\nThe response from counsel for the Respondent was the following:\n\nNow, as to your question of the lists of treaties that, on the one hand, have been entered into by China, there is, to my knowledge, no list, no official list [,..]400\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 60:12-14.\n\n235.\n\nThe response from counsel for the Claimant was similar:\n\nThere is no evidence in the record that any similar Notification in any way, shape, or form was made by China in respect of the category of bilateral investment treaties. It\u2019s not in the record. It didn\u2019t happen.401\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 85:4-7.\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal, being left with no actual information on the status of the PRC/Laos BIT must analyze the situation by application of the relevant rules: Article 15 of the VCST and Article 29 of the VCLT. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the conditions of Article 15 shall be verified first, as the transition came first in the chronology of events relevant to the issue of whether the Treaty applies or not.\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore turn first to Article 15 of the VCST and apply the rule developed in the framework of the international law on State succession. It is well known that it is the PRC\u2019s contention that no transfer of sovereignty took place in December 1999, since it merely \"resumed\" its exercise of sovereignty over Macao, as it did over Hong Kong. The Tribunal wants to put it beyond doubt that its approach does not contradict this position of the PRC when it applies the rules on State succession. Indeed, as explained by an author in relation to Hong Kong (an explanation that also applies to Macao), \"there is little doubt that the \u2018transition\u2019 on 1 July 1997 largely comports with the definition of \u2018state succession\u2019\u2014as \u2018the replacement of one state by another in the responsibility for the international relations of territory\u2019\u2014and that the issues raised as a result of this event are generally covered within the branch of international law which \u2018deals with the legal consequences of change of sovereignty over territory.\u2019\"402\n\nMushkat, in \"Hong Kong and Succession of Treaties\", *ICLQ,* 1997, pp. 191-197 **(\"Mushkat\").**\n\n238.\n\nThe central question is: Does the PRC/Laos BIT enter into the general rule or the exceptions to Article 15 and Article 29? If the general rule applies, the BIT will be applicable to the Macao SAR; if one of the exceptions applies, the BIT will not be applicable to the Macao SAR. The general rule\u2014 *i.e.,* the extension of the treaty to the whole territory, at the moment of a transfer of sovereignty or at any time\u2014applies if none of the exceptions are satisfied. In order to ascertain whether or not the general rule applies, a negative approach must be adopted, *i.e.* an approach that verifies first whether any of the exceptions apply. If the answer is negative, it can be asserted that the applicable rule is the general rule of extension of the treaty to the new part of the territory, or in the case there is no succession, to the whole territory.\n\ni) Does it appear from the PRC/Laos BIT that it was not extended to the Macao SAR at the moment of recovery of sovereignty by the PRC, because the application of the Treaty to that territory would be incompatible with the object and purpose of the Treaty?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe object and purpose of the BIT is stated in the Preamble in the following terms:\n\n[The two Contracting States] desiring to encourage, protect, and create favorable conditions for investment by investors [...] based on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit and for the purpose of the development of economic cooperation between both States, [h]ave agreed as follows [...]403\n\nPreamble to the PRC/Laos Treaty (Ex. D to Amended Notice).\n\n240.\n\nThe purpose is twofold: to protect the investor and develop economic cooperation. The Tribunal does not find\u2014and no element has been provided by the Respondent to that effect\u2014 that the extension of the PRC/Laos BIT could be contrary to such a dual purpose. In fact, the larger scope the Treaty has, the better fulfilled the purposes of the Treaty are in this case: more investors\u2014who would not otherwise be protected\u2014are internationally protected, and the economic cooperation benefits a larger territory that would otherwise not receive such benefit.\n\n241.\n\nIn other words, the Tribunal is satisfied that the extension of the PRC/Laos Treaty to the Macao SAR is not incompatible with its object and purpose, which again is to \"encourage, protect and create *favorable conditions for investment* by investors of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State [...] and for the purpose of the *development of economic cooperation* between both States [,..]\".404\n\nPreamble to the PRC/Laos Treaty (emphasis added) (Ex. D to Amended Notice).\n\n242.\n\nAllowing investors from the Macao SAR to benefit from the protections of the PRC/Laos Treaty is fundamentally compatible with this object and purpose, the more so that there is no other possibly competing BIT adopted by the Macao SAR with Laos.\n\nii) Is it otherwise established that the PRC/Laos BIT was not extended to the Macao SAR at the moment of recovery of sovereignty by the PRC, because the application of the Treaty to that territory would radically change the conditions for its operation?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe question which must be answered next is whether the extension of the PRC/Laos BIT to the Macao SAR radically changes the conditions of application of the Treaty. The Tribunal considers that this question is particularly relevant considering the different economic philosophy that pertains to Mainland China and the Macao SAR, which is illustrated by the famous formula \"one country, two systems.\"\n\n244.\n\nConcerning the question of bilateral treaties and whether or not a succession to them radically changes the conditions for their operation, there are two schools of thought.\n\n245.\n\nFor some States, the personal aspect of a bilateral treaty implies that the replacement of one State with another in a bilateral relationship radically changes the condition for its operation with the consequence that the general rule of continuity should not apply. For other States, the continuity rule applies generally to bilateral treaties as well as to multilateral treaties, unless there are specific elements that lead to the conclusion that a change in the Contracting Parties would radically change the conditions for their operation.\n\n246.\n\nThe Tribunal notes first that Article 15 does not distinguish between multilateral and bilateral treaties. Second, the Tribunal considers that it would be excessive to say that all bilateral treaties are **so** personal, **so** related to *intuitu personae* questions that they cannot survive a State\u2019s succession. In other words, the Tribunal considers that it is necessary to consider the application of the general rule to bilateral treaties on a case-by-case basis.\n\n247.\n\nIn the case at hand, a specific element is the fact that the States Parties to the PRC/Laos BIT were States with planned economies, and that the extension of this BIT was to include a capitalist region. This could give some credibility to the argument that there is a fundamental change of circumstances which would call for the non-extension of the Treaty. Some doctrinal approaches would seem to support to such an argument. In The Hague Lecture on State Succession mentioned earlier, it was indicated that:\n\n[...] political treaties constitute a specific category of treaties concluded *intuitu personae,* according to the characteristics of a specific State, such as treaties of alliance, or certain commercial **treaties concluded between States with a planned economy.** Their extinction in case of succession is, again, an application of a general principle of international law which is the fundamental change of circumstances.\"405\n\nStern, p. 170 (CLA-140) [English translation provided by the Tribunal, the original French being:\n\n248.\n\nIt can indeed be the case that when a treaty is concluded between two States with planned economies, the extension of such treaty to a capitalist economy would fundamentally change the conditions for its application if the treaty was based on features specific to a planned economy and irreconcilable with the liberal principles of a capitalist economy. The Tribunal, however, has not found in the Respondent\u2019s case any indication in this direction or any attempt to prove the existence of different conditions for the application of the PRC/Laos BIT in Mainland China and in the Macao SAR.\n\n\"Les trait\u00e9s politiques constituent une cat\u00e9gorie sp\u00e9cifique de trait\u00e9s conclus *intuitu personae,* en fonction des caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019un Etat pr\u00e9cis, tels que des trait\u00e9s d\u2019alliance, ou certains trait\u00e9s commerciaux conclus entre Etats \u00e0 \u00e9conomie planifi\u00e9e. Leur extinction en cas de succession appara\u00eet, encore une fois, comme une mise en oeuvre d\u2019un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du droit international qui est le *changement fondamental de circonstances.\"]* (emphasis added)\n\n249.\n\nIn the present case, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that a treaty that would not be extended to the Macao SAR under Article 15 would be a treaty imposing \"communist\" values or institutions in the Macao SAR. This is very clear under the \"one country, two systems\" doctrine, which is reflected both in the respective Preambles of the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.\n\n250.\n\nThe Preamble to the Joint Declaration affirms that \"[t]he current social and economic systems in Macao will remain unchanged, and so will the life-style.\"406 The Preamble to the Basic Law of the Macao SAR states that \"[...] under the principle of \"one country, two systems\", the socialist system and policies will not be practiced in Macao.\"407\n\nJoint Declaration (RE-11).\n\nBasic Law of the Macao SAR (RE-09).\n\n251.\n\nIt appears that the treaties that will not be extended under the applicable principles are those whose application would endanger the capitalist system and the liberal way of life. Such is not the case of the PRC/Laos BIT; to the contrary.\n\n252.\n\nIndeed, a comparison of the BITs of the Netherlands and Portugal entered into with the PRC (which are very similar to the PRC/Laos BIT) and the Macao SAR, respectively, show that they contain very similar provisions. For example, the articles on the settlement of investment disputes are the same but for one feature; this tends to prove that the rules of the PRC/Laos BIT can be considered as compatible with their application in the Macao SAR and do not need to be rejected for incompatibility with the capitalist economic system.408\n\nA similar analysis has been performed as far as the resumption of the sovereignty of the PRC over Hong Kong by Mushkat (p. 169): \"[...] the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong cannot be deemed a \u2018fundamental change\u2019 that \u2018radically transforms\u2019 the nature of the territory, allowing claims of *rebus sic stantibus\"* to refute continuity of the applicable treaty regime.\"\n\n253.\n\nIt could also be said\u2014and the Respondent presented arguments to this effect\u2014that the automatic extension should not apply, as it has been *otherwise established* by the Joint Declaration409 and the Macao\u2019s SAR Basic Law,410which both recognize Macao SAR\u2019s treatymaking powers in economic matters.\n\nJoint Declaration (RE-11).\n\nBasic Law of the Macao SAR (RE-09).\n\n254.\n\nThe Joint Declaration deals in the following manner with the treaties of the PRC (the second paragraph of this Article has been reproduced in Article 138 of the Basic Law of the Macao SAR):\n\n**VIII**\n\nSubject to the principle that foreign affairs are the responsibility of the Central People\u2019s Government, the Macao [SAR] may on it\u2019s own, using the name \"Macao, China\", maintain and develop relations and conclude and implement agreements with states, regions and relevant international or regional organizations in the appropriate fields, such as the economy, trade, finance, shipping, communications, tourism, culture, science and technology and sports. [...]\n\nThe application to the Macao [SAR] of international agreements to which the [PRC] is a member or becomes a party shall be decided by the Central People\u2019s Government, in accordance with the circumstances and needs of the [SAR], and after seeking the views of the government of the [SAR].\n\n255.\n\nBased on these articles, the Respondent argued that the automatic extension provided for in Article 15 has to be rejected as it was otherwise provided by the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.\n\n256.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal, this argument merits consideration as it could appear at first sight that the PRC and Portugal have provided for a specific way to deal with the extension of international agreements of the PRC to the Macao SAR, and have therefore superseded the automatic extension provided for as the general rule in Article 15 of the VCST.\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal notes at the outset that the Basic Law of the Macao SAR in and of itself, as an internal law, cannot be considered as legally capable of modifying the international rule set out in Article 15. It is well known that \"the binding character of treaties is determined by international law, which on this point takes precedence over internal law.\"411\n\nSchaus, in Corten & Klein, p. 700 (CLA-105).\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, considers that the same is not true of the Joint Declaration which can be considered an international treaty and, more precisely, a devolution treaty, by which the two States involved in a process of succession decide the modalities of such succession.\n\n259.\n\nBefore entering into a consideration of the legal value of such a devolution treaty, the Tribunal wishes to focus on the meaning of Article VIII of the Joint Declaration, reproduced word-for-word in Article 138 of the Basic Law of the Macao SAR, as the Parties presented diverging interpretations of these articles. The Tribunal recalls the main elements of Article VIII: \"The application to the Macao [SAR] of international agreements [...] shall be decided by the Central People\u2019s Government [...] after seeking the views of the government of the Region.\"\n\n260.\n\nThe Respondent principally relied on this article for the proposition that, because the Macao SAR was not consulted by the PRC before the Treaty was extended to its territory, the Treaty has no application to Macanese investors. Indeed the Respondent places great weight on the fact that the views of the Macao SAR in relation to the PRC/Laos BIT have never been requested:\n\nTo my knowledge, neither in Macao nor in Hong Kong has the local government been consulted over a possible extension of an International Treaty upon the request of the Central Government. Beijing has never consulted or has never asked the Government, either the executive body or the legislative body, over the potential application in Macao of treaties to which China has entered into [..,]412\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 60:4-11.\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimant has a radically different reading of the same language:\n\nWhat Laos has said is that this means that you don\u2019t apply the customary rule until the PRC actually consults with the Macao SAR. But, in fact, the more consistent reading with respect to the customary rule is\u2014and supported by the text here, is that, in fact, the customary rule applies until such time if and when the PRC decides to actually make explicit a contrary intention, and at that juncture should take the step of consultation.413\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 93:8-15.\n\n262.\n\nIn other words, according to the Respondent, the PRC/Laos BIT could only have been extended after seeking the views of the Macao SAR Government; and, according to the Claimant, the PRC/Laos BIT is to be presumed applicable to the Macao SAR until the PRC Government decides, after consulting the Macao SAR, that it does not apply. The Tribunal considers that neither of these lines of reasoning stands scrutiny.\n\n263.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s analysis is not coherent with the basic rule of interpretation of treaties embodied in Article 31 of the VCLT, requiring that a treaty \"shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" The wording of Article VIII of the Joint Declaration is to the effect that the treaties will be applied *when* the PRC Government so decides and not that they will be applied *unless* the PRC Government so decides.\n\n264.\n\nBut the Respondent\u2019s analysis, although coherent with the wording of the text, does not bring about the result sought by the Respondent. This is so because of the legal nature of the Joint Declaration, which can be considered as a devolution treaty.414\n\nBy analogy, it can be mentioned that the Joint Declaration concerning Hong Kong has been registered as a treaty in the UN. See Slinn, Aspects juridiques du retour de Hong Kong \u00e0 la Chine, *AFDI,* 1996 (p. 274): \"Le c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u00e9licat de la question du statut de l\u2019arrangement se refl\u00e8te dans l\u2019emploi du titre \u00abD\u00e9claration commune\u00bb plut\u00f4t que de celui d\u2019\u00abaccord\u00bb, encore que l\u2019instrument ait \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9 par les deux parties comme un accord international conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 102 de la Charte de l\u2019ONU.\"\n\n[English translation from the French: \"The delicate aspect of the question of the status of the arrangement is reflected in the use of the title \"Joint Declaration\" rather than \"Agreement\", even though the instrument was registered by the two parties as an international agreement pursuant to Article 102 of the UN Charter.\"] The same is possibly true for this Joint Declaration, but the Tribunal was provided with no information to that effect.\n\n265.\n\nSuch treaties can only bind third parties if they apply the customary principles of international law. This was explained in The Hague Course on State Succession. One of the customary rules on State succession is the rule of the *\"effet relatif des trait\u00e9s\",* the consequences of which were described in the following manner:\n\nBien entendu, cette r\u00e8gle signifie simplement que les trait\u00e9s de d\u00e9volution s\u2019ils donnent des solutions diff\u00e9rentes de celles qui sont pr\u00e9vues par les r\u00e8gles de la succession d\u2019Etats ne s\u2019imposent pas aux Etats tiers ; si ces trait\u00e9s mettent en \u0153uvre les solutions r\u00e9sultant du droit coutumier, la mani\u00e8re dont la succession d\u2019Etats est r\u00e9gl\u00e9e s\u2019impose aux Etats tiers, parce qu\u2019ils sont tenus au respect du droit international. L\u00e0 encore la r\u00e8gle n\u2019appara\u00eet que comme une transposition, dans le domaine de la succession d\u2019Etats, d\u2019une des r\u00e8gles de base du droit des trait\u00e9s, qui est la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019effet relatif des trait\u00e9s, codifi\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 57 de la Convention de Vienne sur le droit des trait\u00e9s.415\n\nStern, p. 169 (CLA-140). [English translation from the French: \"Of course, this rule simply means that if devolution treaties adopt different solutions to those foreseen by the rules of State succession, those solutions do not bind third States; if the treaties adopt solutions that conform with customary international law, the manner by which the State succession is governed does apply to third States because they are obliged to abide by international law. There again the rule only appears as a transposition, in the domain of State succession, of one of the fundamental rules of the law of treaties, which is the rule of the relative effect of treaties, codified by Article 57 of the VCLT.\"]\n\n266.\n\nThis was also underscored in relation to the Joint Declaration between the PRC and Great Britain concerning Hong Kong by an author, who said that \"[n]otwithstanding the reasonableness of the Hong Kong formula or the \u2018devolutionary\u2019 function of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, questions may be posed in relation to the binding effect on third parties.\"416\n\nMushkat, p. 194.\n\n267.\n\nAs pointed out by the Claimant during the Hearing on Jurisdiction, no element has been submitted to the Tribunal to indicate that Laos was informed of such an internal procedure or whether such procedure was ever enforced:\n\n[...] there is actually no evidence in the record about the actual practice of the PRC with respect to this consultation, internal procedure, none. So, we actually have no evidence about when it has been invoked, in what circumstance it has been invoked, whether it\u2019s a law on the books and doesn\u2019t reflect practice\u2014nothing. We have nothing on that.417\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 90:19-25.\n\n268.\n\nIn other words, Laos, having not been informed that its treaty with the PRC would only be extended after a procedure of consultation\u2014which in fact never seems to have been enforced\u2014, cannot claim that such an agreement between the PRC and Laos could set aside the international rule applicable to a bilateral treaty between itself and the PRC.\n\n269.\n\nIn the absence of convincing elements to the contrary, the Tribunal is left with no other option but to consider that, by application of Article 15 of the VCST, the PRC/Laos BIT must be deemed to have been extended to the Macao SAR. This provisional conclusion has to be verified and confirmed by the analysis of the application to the situation of Article 29 of the VCLT which has broader exceptions than the ones included in Article 15 of the VCST.\n\niii) Does it appear from the PRC/Laos BIT that it is not applicable to the whole territory?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, on the one hand, that the PRC/Laos BIT does not contain an express provision stating that *it applies to the Macao SAR.* But this is not necessary as the principle of territorial extension of the State\u2019s legal order embodied in Article 29 applies, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n271.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes, on the other hand, that it is also evident that the PRC/Laos BIT has *not expressly excluded its application to the Macao SAR,* as has, for example, been the case of the Protocol accompanying the PRC/Russia BIT entered into in 2006.418 This Protocol expressly provides that \"[u]nless otherwise agreed by both Contracting Parties, the Agreement does not apply to\" the Macao SAR.419 Both Parties mentioned during the Hearing on Jurisdiction the fact that the Treaty does not mention that it does not apply to the entire territory.\n\nPRC/Russia BIT (CLA-90).\n\nPRC/Russia BIT (CLA-90).\n\n272.\n\nIn the morning session, counsel for the Respondent stated:\n\nAnd the principle reads as follows: \"Treaties are binding upon the entire territory, unless it\u2019s provided otherwise in the Treaty and intention appears in the Treaty or is otherwise established.\" We have been through the Treaty together. It does not provide for a definition of the territory. So, the principle would be, under Article 29, that unless it is otherwise intended by the Parties or by\u2014here, by China, then it should apply to the entire territory of China.420\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 14:14-22.\n\n273.\n\nIn the afternoon session, counsel for the Claimant echoed this statement:\n\nNow, you heard Ms. Willems this morning, I think confirm this when she stated, \"There is no provision as to restriction of territory.\" On this we agree.421\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 77:12-14.\n\n274.\n\nThis element should, however, not be overestimated as it might simply be explained by the fact that the PRC/Laos BIT was signed in 1993, and that at that time it would not have made sense to exclude the Macao SAR which was not then a part of the Chinese territory under PRC sovereignty. By contrast, with respect to the PRC/Russia BIT, which was signed in 2006, it made sense to deal with the question of the extension of the BIT to Macao. As stated by Mark Villiger:\n\nA general presumption is established that, when a State concludes a treaty, the latter applies to the entire territory of the State, and individual areas and territories **need only be mentioned** where there is a special reason for doing so, in particular **to exclude them** from the treaty\u2019s application. [...] If there are territorial changes, the treaty continues, in principle, to apply to the entire territory; different intentions would have to be renegotiated with, or at least be tacitly approved by, the other parties.\"422\n\nVilliger, pp. 392-393 (emphasis added) (CLA-116).\n\n275.\n\nIt is a fact that no intention to exclude the Macao SAR from the application of the PRC/Laos BIT has been transmitted by the PRC to Laos, at least none that the Tribunal has been made aware of.\n\n276.\n\nOn the other hand, the return of Macao to Chinese sovereignty was not a unforeseen event; it had been negotiated for a relatively long period of time. The first step was the establishment of diplomatic relations between the PRC and Portugal on 8 February 1979, which permitted the launching of negotiations between the two countries on the future of Macao. Official negotiations began in June 1986 in Beijing and gave birth to the Joint Declaration of 1987 which entered into force on 15 January 1988. The Joint Declaration states that Macao will return to the PRC\u2019s sovereignty on 20 December 1999, and organizes the transitory period.423 Thus, at the moment of the conclusion of the PRC/Laos BIT, it was already common knowledge that in a few years\u2019 time, Macao would be under the PRC\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nThis information is public and is derived from an article by Goy, *La r\u00e9trocession de Macau,* AFDI, 1997, pp. 271-285. See also Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder: \"[...] it *was* clear in 1993 that both Portugal and the PRC recognized that the former\u2019s administration over Macau would cease, thereby restoring full Chinese sovereignty over its territory\" (\u00b6 15) (Claimant\u2019s emphasis). See also the Hearing Transcript, p. 80:2-9, where counsel for the Claimant stated:\n\n\"So, there is no dispute that six years before the Treaty was signed, the PRC had concluded in 1987 the Joint Declaration with Portugal which provided that the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao with effect from 20 December 1999. And as the Tribunal\u2019s aware, it\u2019s a pretty detailed Declaration about the intent of the two Parties with respect to the transfer of sovereignty in 1999\".\n\n277.\n\nThis factual situation means that no definite conclusion can be drawn either from the silence of the Treaty on its extension to the Macao SAR, or its silence on the non-extension of the Treaty to the Macao SAR.\n\niv) Is it otherwise established that the PRC/Laos BIT is not applicable to the whole territory?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThis question in fact turns on the meaning of the existence of two sets of BITs by the same foreign country\u2014Laos\u2014one with the PRC and one with the Macao SAR. The question thus raised is whether the possibility of co-existence of a PRC-BIT and a Macao SAR-BIT with the same third State \"otherwise establishes\" that the PRC/Laos BIT cannot apply to the Macao SAR.\n\n279.\n\nHaving been made aware of the existence of two instances where there co-exists a BIT with the PRC and with the Macao SAR, the Tribunal asked, at the close of the Hearing on Jurisdiction, for clarification on that point. As indicated by the President of the Tribunal:\n\n[I]t has been brought to our attention [...] that there are two\u2014in the case of Portugal and the Netherlands, there are actually treaties entered into by Macao with these countries and also with China. [...] [I]t would be helpful to us if you could analyze the text of these four treaties in terms of any relationship between the two and how they [work] or don\u2019t together.424\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 176:7-13.\n\n280.\n\nThe motivation for this question was to ascertain whether the analysis of these BITs could give some \"otherwise established\" indications on the respective role of these two series of treaties and, for example, help to ascertain whether the existence of one necessarily excluded the existence of the other.\n\n281.\n\nAn initial remark must be made by the Tribunal. The four treaties\u2014the PRC/Portugal, PRC/Netherlands, Macao/Portugal, Macao/Netherlands treaties\u2014were concluded after the handover of Macao to the PRC in 1999. As such, they do not call for the application of Article 15 of the VCST, but only of Article 29 of the VCLT. Interestingly, in the case of Portugal, the Macao/Portugal BIT preceded the PRC/Portugal BIT by five years, while in the case of the Netherlands, the PRC/Netherlands BIT was concluded seven years prior to the Macao/Netherlands BIT.\n\n282.\n\nThis sequence of events\u2014a PRC-BIT followed by a Macao-BIT with the same third country, and a Macao-BIT followed by a PRC-BIT with the same third country\u2014has been analyzed by the Claimant as indicating that \"there is no evidence that the PRC considered duplicate treaties between itself and Macau on the one hand and third States on the other to be contradictory or mutually exclusive.\"425\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 47.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal considers this analysis compelling.\n\n284.\n\nA first point which was has come to light is that the territorial scope of the two series of BITs is not the same.\n\n285.\n\nIn the PRC/Portugal BIT signed in 2005, the territorial scope is as follows:\n\n**Article 1(2)b)**\n\nFor the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the territory comprised by the Macao peninsula and the islands of Taipa and Coloane.\n\n286.\n\nIn the Macao SAR/Portugal BIT signed in 2000, the territorial scope is as follows:\n\n**Article 1(4)**\n\nThe term \"territory\" means the territory in which the Parties have, in accordance with international law and their national laws, sovereign rights or jurisdiction, including land territory, territorial sea and air space above them, as well as those maritime areas adjacent to the outer limits of the territorial sea, including seabed and subsoil thereof [...]\n\n287.\n\nIn the PRC/Netherlands BIT signed in 2001, the territorial scope is as follows:\n\n**Article 1 (4)**\n\nFor the purpose of this Agreement, the term \"territory\" means respectively:\n\n- For the People\u2019s Republic of China, the territory of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the People\u2019s Republic of China (including the territorial sea and air space above it) as well as any area beyond its territorial sea within which the People\u2019s Republic of China has sovereign rights of exploration of and exploitation of resources of the seabed and its sub-soil and superjacent water resources in accordance with Chinese law and international law.\n\n288.\n\nIn the Macao SAR/Netherlands BIT signed in 2008, the territorial scope is as follows:\n\n**Article 1(c) (ii)**\n\n- in respect of the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the territory is peninsula of Macau and the islands of Taipa and Coloane.\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent draws the following conclusions from the comparison of the territorial scope of the two series of BITs:\n\nThe territorial definition in the BITs clearly indicates that the Macao [SAR] [has] the power to enter into BITs to cover [its] own territory notwithstanding the fact that China has also entered into BITs with these same third states. This indicates that the territorial limit of the Chinese BITs [is] confined to Mainland China.426\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept this conclusion. It can indeed also mean, with as much if not more logic, that the PRC-BIT applies to the whole territory including the Macao SAR, while the Macao SAR-BIT is confined to the territory of Macao but cannot extend to Mainland China.\n\n291.\n\nAnother argument put forward by the Respondent is that the overlapping of the PRC and Macao BITs with the same third State would bring about \"legal chaos for foreign investors.\"427\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\n292.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the superposition of instruments of protection does not bring about chaos, but rather better protection to foreign investors. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant when it states that \"[t]he fact that the PRC authorized Macau to enter into the bilateral investment treaties at issue does not otherwise establish an intention that its own BITs should not extend to the territory of Macau; it is equally consistent with a supplemental regime of protection for Macanese investors, above and beyond that provided by the PRC treaties.\"428\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 48 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis).\n\n293.\n\nIf one takes the example of the two BITs with Portugal, it is apparent that Article 9 of the PRC-BIT and Article 8 of the Macao-BIT are very similar, with a difference being that the PRC-BIT gives a further option to the investor\u2014in addition to the choice of the competent national courts and an *ad hoc* arbitration tribunal under the rules of UNCITRAL\u2014to resort to ICSID arbitration:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Macao SAR/Portugal BIT, 2000**  **Article 8**  1 \u2013 Disputes between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party relating to an investment in the first area of the second will be resolved through negotiations.  2 \u2013 If the dispute cannot be resolved in accordance with the preceding paragraph within six months from the date on which one of the litigants have requested in writing, the investor may choose to submit the dispute to one of the following instances:  a) The competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose area the investment is located; or  b) At an ad hoc arbitral tribunal established in accordance with the rules of arbitration of the United Nations Commission for Trade and Development (UNCITRAL), which are then in force | **PRC/Portugal BIT, 2005**  **Article 9**  1. Any dispute concerning investments between a Party and an investor of the other Party should as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties in dispute.  2. If the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the date when it has been raised by one of the parties in dispute, it shall, at the request of the investor of the other State, be submitted at the choice of the investor to:  a) the competent court of the Party that is a party to the dispute;  b) arbitration under the Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID);  c) an ad hoc arbitral tribunal to be established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) or other arbitration rules. |\n\n294.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the concomitant application of these two BITs would lead to \"legal chaos\". The more dispute settlement options an investor has, the better it is protected, and the more enhanced the economic cooperation will be between the concerned States.\n\n295.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the existence of two treaties facilitates rather than hinders the fulfillment of the goals of the BITs, which are the protection of the foreign investors and the economic development of the host State. The Tribunal notes that the same analysis was performed by the tribunal in the *Tza Yap Shum* case, where it stated that \"Hong Kong\u2019s power to conclude its own investment promotion and protection treaties with countries wherewith China also has entered into a BIT is not necessarily redundant.\"429\n\n*Tza Yap Shum,* \u00b6| 76 (CLA-70/RA-10).\n\n296.\n\nThe Respondent has presented another argument, based on the Macao SAR\u2019s autonomy in economic matters, to support the view that the PRC/Laos BIT does not apply to the Macao SAR, *i.e.,* \"[t]he very fact that Macao has entered into no BIT with Laos reveals that the Macao SAR under its autonomy has chosen not to enter into any investment protection treaty with Laos.\"430\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 37.\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by such reasoning. In its view, it is also possible to make the argument to the contrary: that the Macao SAR has not entered into a BIT with Laos because it considered that its investors were sufficiently protected by the PRC/Laos BIT?\n\n298.\n\nA last mention should be made of a remark made by the Claimant related generally to the object and purpose of BITs. After stating that \"there is thus no conflict where extending the PRC treaties to Macau ensures that Macanese investors enjoy dual sets of protections in the two instances discussed above\", the Claimant added that:\n\n[...] the object and purpose is not served by denying Macanese investors the protection of the 130 BITs concluded by the PRC\u2014in circumstances where there is no statement or convincing evidence mandating the contrary conclusion from either the PRC or the Macau SAR - and leaving them to avail themselves of only two bilateral treaties that Macau has concluded on its own behalf.431\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response, \u00b6 50 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis). See also, in the same sense, Claimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 244, where the Claimant states that the Respondent\u2019s position: \"[...] would categorically deny all investors from Macau and Hong Kong the protections generally afforded to other Chinese investors worldwide. Such an outcome is not only inconsistent with the purposes of the investment treaty regime, it is incompatible with China\u2019s \"one country, two systems\" policy, which was created to enhance\u2014not diminish\u2014the protections afforded to investors and other denizens of the SARs.\"\n\n299.\n\nOf course, the Tribunal limits its finding to the specific PRC/Laos BIT, which it has analyzed on the basis of the few factual elements provided to it and in application of the relevant rules of international law. Other conclusions might be arrived at with other factual circumstances surrounding other BITs.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes therefore that the PRC/Laos BIT is applicable to the Macao SAR.\n\n**2. Whether Sanum qualifies as an investor under the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Whether Claimant is established under the municipal laws of the PRC**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether the reference to \"the laws and regulations of each contracting State\" in Article 1(2)(b) of the Treaty should be understood in the sense of covering the full territorial extension of each State or, in the case of the PRC, of excluding the Macao SAR and the Hong Kong SAR.\n\n302.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s argument for excluding the SARs is based on the existence of three different legal regimes in the State of China: one for Mainland China and one for each of the SARs. These regimes include different company laws and the company law of Mainland China does not apply to the SARs. For the Tribunal, the issue is not how many laws or legal regimes there are in the PRC and whether the investor has been established under one or the other, but whether an economic entity established under any one of such legal regimes is an economic entity established in accordance with the laws and regulations of the PRC. In other words, should the Tribunal include a territorial limitation in interpreting the scope of Article 1(2)(b)?\n\n303.\n\nThe language of the Treaty does not differentiate between economic entities in accordance with the legal regime under which they were established. There is no difference of treatment between the two States. The Preamble affirms the desire \"to encourage, protect and create favorable conditions for investment by investors of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State [...]\". The Tribunal has already decided that the Treaty applies to all the territory over which the PRC is sovereign. It is consequent with that decision that an economic entity established under the laws applicable in any part of the territory of the PRC is to be considered to have been established under the laws and regulations of the PRC.\n\n304.\n\nThe Respondent has placed particular emphasis on the mutual respect of the sovereignty of the parties recorded in the Preamble of the Treaty. There is no doubt that the PRC has sovereignty over the Macao SAR and the Hong Kong SAR; it would not be respectful of that sovereignty for the Tribunal to consider that laws enacted in either of the two SARs are not enacted in the PRC.\n\n305.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant is an economic entity established in accordance with the laws and regulations of the PRC as required by Article 1(2)(b) of the Treaty.\n\n**(b) Whether Sanum qualifies as an \"economic entity\" within the meaning of the Treaty?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe Respondent has interpreted the term \"economic entity\" as showing the intent of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty to exclude shell companies. Respondent contends that, in order to qualify as an economic entity, an investor must perform some economic activities in the State the protection of which the investor seeks and not in third States. In addition, these activities need to pertain to the investment that is the subject of the claim. The Respondent has related these conditions for an investor to qualify as such under the Treaty to the criteria used to ascertain the nationality of a company. For the Respondent, \"economic entity\" is concerned with the criterion of the seat of a company; the concept of \"economic entity\" encompasses more than the concept of incorporation. It is the Respondent\u2019s contention that mere incorporation does not in and of itself determine the nationality of an investor.\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal has difficulty in reading these limitations into the Treaty. As pointed out by the Claimant, Chinese treaties are drafted so as to include entities that may not be separate legal entities with their own legal personality. The concept of \"economic entity\" contemplates a wider array of entities than the concept of corporation and is related to the particularities of the Chinese legal system. Rather than a limitation on the concept of investor, \"economic entity\" is a wider term that may include entities that are engaged in economic activities but without separate legal personality.\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal also has difficulty with the connection allegedly intended by the Treaty between the concept of nationality and economic entity. The Treaty requires that the economic entity be incorporated in the PRC or Laos. To extend the criteria to define nationality through the use of \"economic entity\" in the definition of investor is a far-fetched exercise in interpreting the text of the Treaty. It is hardly consonant with the canons of interpretation under the VCLT to which both Contracting Parties subscribe.\n\n309.\n\nThe search for a convenient place of incorporation is common practice whether for fiscal reasons or for the network of investment treaties a country may have concluded. There is nothing wrong *per se* in this search. As stated by the *Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia* tribunal:\n\nIt is not uncommon in practice, and\u2014absent a particular limitation\u2014not illegal to locate one\u2019s operations in a jurisdiction perceived to provide a beneficial regulatory and legal environment in terms, for example, of taxation or the substantive law of the jurisdiction, including the availability of a BIT.432\n\n*Aguas del Tunari, S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, October 21, 2005,\u00b6 330(d).\n\n310.\n\nIn the same vein the *Phoenix Action Ltd v. The Czech Republic* tribunal articulated the position as follows:\n\nInternational investors can of course structure *upstream* their investments, which meet the requirement of participating in the economy of the host State, in a manner that best fits their need for international protection, in choosing freely the vehicle through which they perform their investment.433\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, April 15, 2009, \u00b6 94 ***(\"Phoenix\")*** (emphasis in original).\n\n311.\n\nHowever, tribunals have rejected the practice of so-called treaty shopping when a company is incorporated in a certain jurisdiction after a dispute has arisen in order for the investor to avail itself of access to arbitration that it otherwise would not have:\n\n[A]n international investor cannot modify *downstream* the protection granted to its investment by the host State, once the acts which the investor considers are causing damages to its investment have already been committed.434\n\n*Phoenix,* \u00b6 95 (emphasis in original).\n\n312.\n\nThe Respondent has not argued that this was the case in the dispute before the Tribunal.\n\n313.\n\nThe Respondent has relied extensively on the separate opinion in *Tokios Tokeles.* The Respondent has submitted that the decision in **Tokios Tokeles** was wrong. It is not for this Tribunal to determine whether the majority of that tribunal or the dissenting arbitrator was correct. Suffice it to say here that **Tokios Tokeles** is irrelevant to the matter before this Tribunal. The Claimant is not controlled by nationals of Laos who incorporated it in the Macao SAR and now claim protection under the Treaty against their own State; that is not the issue here.\n\n314.\n\nThe Respondent has affirmed that, \"[t]he purpose and object of this BIT is to protect nationals of one State when investing in the other. It is not to extend the protection to investors and capital from outside the two States.\"435 The Claimant is an economic entity national of the PRC. The Respondent itself has recognized that the Treaty does not include origin-of-capital requirements. Therefore, this argument of the Respondent is without merit.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 118.\n\n315.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal determines that Sanum qualifies as an investor under the Treaty.\n\n**3. Whether the Claimant has made an investment in Laos**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant has not made an investment in Laos because it did not directly invest in Laos and because the contributions made in relation to the shares owned in Savan Vegas and Paksong Vegas were \"apparently made by loans that are being repaid annually from proceeds of the casino.\"436 The Tribunal will proceed to consider whether indirect investments qualify as investments under the BIT and, if this is the case, whether contributions made in the form of loans to the local companies qualify as investments.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 123.\n\n317.\n\nFor ease of reference the Tribunal reproduces here Article 1(1) of the BIT. It reads as follows:\n\nThe term \u2018investments\u2019 means every kind of asset invested by investors of one contracting State in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting State in the territory of the Latter, including mainly,\n\n(a) movable and immovable property and other property rights;\n\n(b) shares in companies or other forms of interest in such companies;\n\n(c) a claim to money or to any performance having an economic value;\n\n(d) copyrights, industrial property, know-how and technological process;\n\n(e) concessions conferred by law, including concessions to search for or to exploit natural resources.\n\n318.\n\nThe definition is wide-ranging and open. First, while certain investments are highlighted, the list is not exclusive. It is a list of the investments that the parties to the BIT considered to be the main investments covered, but not exclusively covered, under the Treaty. Second, the term \"investments\" is defined as \"every kind of asset invested\". Third, the term \"investments\" is not qualified by any adjective such as \"direct\". More importantly, it would be surprising that the parties would have intended to exclude indirect investments and at the same time include among the \"main\" investments \"shares in companies or other forms of interest in such companies\". This provision covers the common business practice of foreign investors using local companies as vehicles to channel the investment, as occurred in this instance.\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not supported its argument with any reference to decisions of arbitral tribunals and has not rebutted or contested the arguments of the Claimant set forth in its Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction other than observing in general that certain submissions have not been dealt with as \"a result of their irrelevance or non-application to this case and hence the absence of a refutation must not be taken as an admission to as the correctness of the assertions.\"437\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 23.\n\n320.\n\nAs to the contributions made to the companies in the form of loans, Article 1(1) of the Treaty does not specify the form in which the contributions must be made to qualify as an investment, whether in the form of loans or equity. On the other hand, Article 1(1) explicitly includes in the definition \"a claim to money\" as one of the main items to be considered as investments. Loans are undoubtedly \"claims to money\" that qualify as investments, as long as they are invested, which is undoubtedly the case here. Sanum alleges also that it has employed its know-how in the hotel and gaming facilities industry.438\n\nAmended Notice, \u00b6 115.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Sanum has made an investment protected by the PRC/Laos BIT.\n\n**4. Whether Laos Consented to Arbitrate Sanum\u2019s Claims under the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Whether the Respondent has consented to arbitrate Sanum\u2019s claims under Article 8 of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nThe issues before the Tribunal are whether access to arbitration is available to the investor before it has recourse to the local courts, and whether the investor may have recourse to arbitration to determine whether an expropriation has occurred. It will be useful to reproduce here the terms of Article 8 of the Treaty and the related paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 4.\n\n323.\n\nArticle 8 provides:\n\n1. Any dispute between an investor of one Contracting State and the other Contracting State in connection with an investment in the territory of the other Contracting State shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through negotiation between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation within six months, either party to the dispute shall be entitled to submit the dispute to the competent court of the Contracting State accepting the investment.\n\n3. If a dispute involving the amount of compensation for expropriation cannot be settled through negotiation within six months as specified in paragraph 1 of this Article 1, it may be submitted at the request of either party to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. The provision of this paragraph shall not apply if the investor concerned has resorted to the procedure specified in the paragraph 2 of this Article.\n\n324.\n\nThe relevant paragraphs of Article 4 read as follows:\n\n1. Neither Contracting State shall expropriate, nationalize or take similar measures (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") against investments of investors of the other Contracting State in its territory, unless the following conditions are met:\n\na. as necessitated by the public interest;\n\nb. in accordance with domestic legal procedures;\n\nc. without discrimination;\n\nd. against appropriate and effective compensation.\n\n2. The compensation mentioned in paragraph 1 (d) of this Article shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated investments at the time when expropriation is proclaimed, be convertible and freely transferable. The compensation shall be paid without unreasonable delay.\n\n325.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether a Chinese investor may have access to arbitration prior to having recourse to the competent courts of Laos. According to the Respondent, Article 8(2) means that the parties to the Treaty agreed that \"no other forum was offered to hear Chinese investor claims, but Laotian local courts. The same would apply to Laotian investors\u2019 claims against China.\"439 This reading of Article 8(2) would completely eliminate access to arbitration in respect of any dispute, including disputes in respect of the quantum of compensation provided for in Article 8(3).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 47(2).\n\n326.\n\nThe structure of Article 8 follows a logical sequence: first amicable negotiation, second recourse to the competent courts or on certain matters access to arbitration. Access to arbitration is optional; the dispute \"may be submitted at the request of either party to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal.\" The investor or the State may submit a dispute to arbitration involving the amount of compensation if negotiation on this matter is not successful. Article 8(3) does not provide that access to arbitration by either party to the dispute on the amount of compensation is subject to prior recourse to the Laotian courts. Under Article 8(2), the Parties to the dispute are not obliged to submit their dispute to the local courts, they are simply \"entitled\" to do so. In any case, the investor or the State would be entitled to have recourse to the local courts irrespective of whether the Treaty provided for it.\n\n327.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the scope of Article 8(3) and on the relationship between Article 8 and Article 4. For the Respondent, Article 8 is clear: it limits access to arbitration in respect of \"a dispute involving the amount of compensation for expropriation.\" The Respondent argues that its interpretation of Article 8(3) is further confirmed by the notification made by the PRC on 7 January 1993, pursuant to Article 24(5) of the ICSID Convention, as to the jurisdiction of ICSID. According to that notification, the PRC \"would only consider submitting to the jurisdiction of disputes over compensation resulting from expropriation and nationalization.\"440\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 150.\n\n328.\n\nAs far as the notification is concerned, the Tribunal notes that it is settled case-law that such notification is for informative purposes only and cannot be considered as a legal obligation to narrow or broaden an otherwise accepted consent to jurisdiction.441\n\nSchreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2001) (Cambridge University Press), pp. 342-347: \"[...] notifications under Art. 25(4) are for purposes of information only and are designed to avoid misunderstanding.\" (p. 344); see also *Tza Yap Shum,* \u00b6\u00b6 163-165; *PSEG v. Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, June 4, 2004, \u00b6\u00b6 135-147; see also *Kaiser Bauxite v. Jamaica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/74/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, July 6, 1975, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 24.\n\n329.\n\nLooking then at the \"ordinary meaning\" of this disposition, as it has to do in accordance with the rules of interpretation of the VCLT, the Tribunal considers that the terms of Article 8(3) indicate that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is more limited than the dispute clauses found in many BITs. Article 8(3) refers to \"disputes involving the amount of compensation for expropriation\" and it does not simply refer to disputes involving an expropriation. As a first impression the text of this provision would seem to restrict the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to matters related to the amount of compensation due in instances of expropriation. However, other readings are possible. The term \"involving\" has a wider meaning than other possible terms such as \"limited to\" which could have been used if the intention of the State Parties had been to limit the jurisdiction of the Tribunal exclusively to disputes on the amount of compensation. \"To involve\" means \"to wrap\", \"to include\", terms that are inclusive rather than exclusive. This wider reading of Article 8(3) would seem more consistent with the other provisions of the Treaty as we will see shortly. It is also consistent with how a similar provision was interpreted by the *Tza Yap Shum* tribunal.\n\n330.\n\nThe interpretation of this provision shall also take into account its \"context\". The Tribunal considers that the first sentence of Article 8(3) cannot be read in isolation, (a) from the sentence that follows, namely, \"[t]he provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if the investor concerned has resorted to the procedure specified in the paragraph 2 of this Article\"; (b) from Article 8(2) and (3) from the conditions to establish expropriation set forth in Article 4(1).\n\n331.\n\nThe second sentence of Article 8(3) denies access to arbitration if the party concerned has resorted to \"the competent court of the Contracting State accepting the investment.\" The Respondent has argued that this sentence in Article 8(3) refers to recourse to the competent court for a dispute involving the amount of compensation for expropriation and not generally to recourse to a competent court. While this is arguably coherent in the context of Article 8, it is difficult to accommodate in the wider context of Article 4(1).\n\n332.\n\nIn accordance with Article 4(1), to establish whether an expropriation had taken place, a competent court would need to decide whether the action of Laos meets the four conditions set forth in that paragraph. The fourth condition is \"appropriate and effective compensation.\" Thus if Articles 8 and Article 4(1) are read together, an investor who would have recourse to a competent court to determine whether an expropriation has occurred would be precluded from submitting the dispute on the amount of compensation to international arbitration because the competent court would have already determined the compensation. There is an overlap between the conditions to be met by an expropriation under the Treaty and the Respondent\u2019s reading of Article 8(3) in isolation of its context. The Respondent has ignored completely this overlap and has assumed that the jurisdiction may be split between the local courts and an arbitral tribunal. Indeed, the Respondent has argued that \"[t]he liability/quantum split under Article 8(2) and (3) is consistent with the substantive split under Article 4(1) and 4(2).\"442 The alleged neat relationship between the two Articles ignores the result that emerges from the preceding analysis by the Tribunal.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 47(3).\n\n333.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s interpretation would leave Article 8(3) without effect. The task of the Tribunal is to interpret the Treaty in such a way that all the provisions of the Treaty have effect even if specific provisions do not refer to each other. The principle of *effet utile* requires international courts and tribunals to interpret international rules \"so as to give them their fullest weight and effect consistent with the normal sense of the words and with other parts of the text and in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every part of the text.\"443 This principle of interpretation has been applied by investment arbitration tribunals and other international tribunals.\n\nGardiner, *Treaty Interpretation* (2008) (Oxford University Press), p. 149.\n\n334.\n\nTo illustrate how the principle has been applied, the Tribunal refers to the decision of the ICSID tribunal in *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. v. Republic of Sri Lanka,* which explained:\n\nNothing is better settled, as a canon of interpretation in all systems of law than that a clause must be so interpreted as to give it a meaning rather than so as to deprive it of meaning444.\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. (AAPL) v. Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Award of June 27, 1990, \u00b6140.\n\n335.\n\nIt has since then been confirmed in a great number of investment awards, which refer to the:\n\n[...] cardinal rule of the interpretation of treaties that each and every operative clause of a treaty is to be interpreted as meaningful rather than meaningless. It is equally well established in the jurisprudence of international law, particularly that of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice, that treaties, and hence their clauses, are to be interpreted so as to render them effective rather than ineffective.445\n\n*Eureko B.V. v. Republic of Poland,* Partial Award *(Ad hoc,* 19 August 2005), \u00b6 248; see also *e.g.,* Noble Ventures v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11, Award of October 12, 2005, \u00b6 50; or *Pan American Energy LLC and BP Argentina Exploration Co. v. Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/13, Decision on Preliminary Objections of July 27, 2006, \u00b6 132; *Cemex Caracas Investments B.V. and Cemex Caracas II Investments B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/15, Decision on Jurisdiction of December 30, 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 104-114; *Tidewater Inc. and others v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction of February 8, 2013, \u00b6 134.\n\n336.\n\nOther arbitral tribunals have faced the task of interpreting similar treaty provisions and the Parties have adduced their decisions in this proceeding. As noted by the Respondent, there is a split among the awards that have interpreted such provisions. The Respondent has pointed out that in their Preambles, none of the BITs underlying the cases of *Tza Yap Shum, European Media Ventures* or *Renta 4* adduced by the Claimant in support of its arguments include the following sentence found in the Preamble of the Treaty: \"to encourage, protect and create favorable conditions for investment by investors of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State based on *the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit* and for the purpose of the development of economic cooperation between both States.\" (Respondent\u2019s emphasis). The Respondent has emphasized the importance of these principles:\n\nWhen applied\u2014how do we apply the principle of respect of sovereignty to international arbitration and international investment arbitration? Well, those principles, when applied to international investment law, and in particular dispute resolution, should and\u2014when applied to international arbitration, foreign investor-State arbitration, push the Tribunal, oblige the Tribunal to respect the choice of domestic jurisdiction clause that is inserted in the Contract.446\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 42:16-23.\n\n337.\n\nCounsel to Respondent concluded by saying that \"a purposive approach does not allow this Arbitral Tribunal to go beyond the wording of the Article 8(3) of the BITs.\"447\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 43:9-11.\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the reference to these principles in the Preamble of the Treaty is sufficient to explain the differences in the interpretation of the jurisdictional clause by the arbitral tribunals concerned. More importantly, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the presence of these principles in the Preamble of the Treaty may override the conclusions of the Tribunal in the analysis of the text of Article 8. In the instant case, to follow the reasoning of the Respondent would mean to justify leaving without effect a clause of the Treaty on the basis of the purpose of the Treaty.\n\n339.\n\nThe purpose and object of the Treaty covers two distinct aspects: the protection of investments and the development of economic cooperation between both States. The balance between these two aspects must be borne in mind by the Tribunal in the analysis of the text of the Treaty, but it does not mean that the Tribunal needs to give preponderance to one aspect over the meaning of a particular clause of the Treaty or leave a clause without effect. The purpose of a treaty as set forth in its preamble may be useful to resolve doubts in its interpretation but it would not justify leaving without effect a clause of the treaty.\n\n340.\n\nTo explain the different conclusions reached by arbitral tribunals, the existence or absence of fork-in-the-road clauses in the underlying BIT is, in the view of the Tribunal, a more relevant factor, and it is a factor taken into consideration by these tribunals. Indeed, in none of the BITs underlying the cases relied upon by the Respondent is there a fork-in-the-road clause that would limit the investor\u2019s access to arbitration if the investor had recourse first to the local courts to determine whether an expropriation had actually occurred. As stated in the opening statement of Claimant\u2019s counsel at the Hearing on Jurisdiction:\n\nMost importantly, I will note at the outset that none of them [of the cases relied on by the Respondent] involve\u2014have fork-in-the-road clauses in their dispute-resolution clauses, and that makes an enormous difference because, as I\u2019ve shown, having the fork-in-the-road clause makes it impossible for an investor to do what Laos says they want the Treaty says it ought to do, which is first bring a claim for expropriation to the Laos courts and then wholly bring the question of compensation/quantum to a Tribunal.448\n\nHearing Transcript, pp. 129:21-130:3.\n\n341.\n\nAs in the case of the Treaty, the Spain/Russia BIT and the PRC/Peru BIT include fork-in-the-road provisions. In reaching its decision on the meaning of the first sentence of Article 8(3) in the latter, the tribunal in *Tza Yap Shum* stated:\n\nIn the opinion of the Tribunal to rule otherwise would eviscerate the provision relating to ICSID arbitration since, in accordance with the final sentence of Article 8(3), to have recourse to tribunals of the State recipient of the investment would definitely preclude the possibility to accede to arbitration under the ICSID Convention.449\n\n*Tza Yap Shum,* \u00b6 188 (CLA-70/RA-10) [English translation provided by the Tribunal. The English translation provided by the Claimant is inaccurate].\n\n342.\n\nFor the reasons explained above, the Tribunal shares this view and concludes that the Respondent has consented to arbitrate claims of expropriation under Article 8 of the Treaty.\n\n**(b) Whether the Respondent has consented to arbitrate Sanum\u2019s claims under Article 3(2)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe question before the Tribunal is whether the MFN clause in the Treaty grants an independent basis for the Tribunal to determine whether an expropriation has occurred and to determine whether the other substantive breaches of Treaty obligations claimed by Sanum have occurred. The Tribunal has already determined that it has jurisdiction as to whether an expropriation has occurred under Article 8 and need not further consider this matter under Article 3(2).\n\n344.\n\nArticle 3(2) reads as follows:\n\nThe treatment and protection as mentioned in Paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be less favorable than that accorded to investments and activities associated with such investments of investors of a third State.\n\n345.\n\nArticle 3(1) provides:\n\nInvestments and activities associated with investments of investors of either Contracting State shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy protection in the territory of the other Contracting State.\n\n346.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether the sentence \"shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy protection in the territory of the other Contracting State\" refers to the standard of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security or whether it extends to all protections provided in the Treaty, including access to international arbitration.\n\n347.\n\nOn the one hand, the Respondent contends that \"protection\" refers to protection and security and not to all the substantive protections under the Treaty. On the other hand, the Claimant has argued that the most natural reading of the term \"protection\" is that \"it extends to *all* of the protections provided in the Treaty.\"450\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 300 (Claimant\u2019s emphasis).\n\n348.\n\nThe Claimant has also argued that \"activities associated with such investments\" include the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, disposal of investments and the settlement of disputes involved in protecting such investments.451 Claimant adduces multiple awards to support different aspects of this reading of \"activities associated with such investments.\"452 Respondent has not addressed this point in its Reply and has simply insisted that Article 3(1) refers to protection and security and bears no relation to access to international arbitration.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 300.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 300.\n\n349.\n\nThe interpretation of the MFN clause has been subject to discrepant views since the decision on jurisdiction of the *Maffezini* tribunal.453 Therefore, it is not difficult for the parties to a dispute to find prior decisions in support of their conflicting positions. The Tribunal is not obliged to follow any particular prior decision but it cannot ignore the arguments of the Parties and the decisions they have used to support them. Therefore, before entering into the analysis of the MFN clause in the Treaty, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to make two general observations related to the cases of *Roslnvest* and *Tza Yap Shum* that figure prominently in the Parties\u2019 arguments.\n\n*Maffezini* (CLA-46).\n\n350.\n\nFirst, notwithstanding the variety of approaches adopted by arbitral tribunals, those tribunals show concern for the reach of their interpretations and seek to limit their effect.\n\n351.\n\nSecond, general pronouncements of arbitral tribunals need to be considered cautiously in the context of the cases in which they were made. For instance, in the series of cases involving Argentina, access to arbitration is subject first to submitting the dispute to the ordinary courts and after 18 months an investor may proceed to arbitration even if a court decided the dispute and the investor was dissatisfied with the result. The Respondent has distinguished the instant case from the Argentine cases because the underlying treaties contained broader arbitration clauses than the dispute resolution clause found here, and the tribunals merely remove threshold requirements for accessing arbitration\"454 The Tribunal agrees with the limited relevance of the Argentine cases.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 167.\n\n352.\n\nThird, Claimant has drawn the attention of the Tribunal to the award on jurisdiction in the **Roslnvest** case and to that tribunal\u2019s finding that the MFN clause permitted importation of a dispute resolution clause. However, this finding needs to be treated with some reservation in view of the caution the **Roslnvest** tribunal showed when it considered the MFN clause. It stated:\n\n*[...] without entering into the much more general question whether MFN-clauses can be used to transfer arbitration clauses from one treaty to another,* the Tribunal concludes that, for the specific wording of Article 3(1) of the UK-Soviet BIT, and for the specific purpose of arbitration with regard to expropriation, the wide wording of Article 8 of the Denmark-Russia BIT is not applicable.455\n\n*Roslnvest,* \u00b6 129 (emphasis added) (RA-19).\n\n353.\n\nThe tribunal reached this conclusion on the effect of an expropriation on the treatment of an investment and then continued to analyze a separate provision on the treatment of the investor and stated: *\"Again limiting its considerations to the possible application of the MFN-clause to arbitration regarding expropriation,* the terms *\u2018use\u2019* and *\u2018enjoyment\u2019* in paragraph (2) lead the Tribunal to different conclusions from those reached with regard to paragraph (1).\"456\n\n*Roslnvest,* \u00b6 130 (emphasis added) (RA-19).\n\n354.\n\nFourth, the tribunal in **Tza Yap Shum** conducted an extensive analysis of the history of MFN clauses and of the MFN clause in the PRC/Peru BIT. The dispute settlement clause in that treaty follows closely the text of Article 8 of the Treaty except that in Article 8(3) of the Peru/PRC BIT there is the following additional sentence: \"Any dispute related to other matters between the investor of any Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party may be submitted to ICSID if the parties to the dispute so agree.\"457 The **Tza Yap Shum** tribunal in its analysis of this Article 8(3) gave particular weight to the fact that the parties had contemplated in that article the possibility of submitting other matters to arbitration but only if the parties would agree beforehand. In view of the need for a further specific agreement, the tribunal rejected the claimant\u2019s arguments to extend through the MFN clause access to arbitration in respect of disputes over the other alleged breaches of the Peru/PRC BIT.458\n\n[English translation from the Spanish provided by the Tribunal]\n\n*Tza Yap Shum,* \u00b6 216\n\n355.\n\nBefore turning to the MFN clause in the Treaty it will be useful to recall the claims advanced by the Claimant under the Treaty MFN clause. In the Amended Notice, the Claimant has invoked its right under Article 3(2) of the Treaty:\n\n[...] to receive treatment no less favorable than the Respondent has accorded to the investors of third States, such as the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, in respect of its right to seek compensation for a breach of either the autonomous treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment or alternative standards of treatment no less favorable, such as Article 8 of the Laos-Germany BIT. Article 2(3) of the Laos-Sweden-BIT, or Article 6 of the Laos-Japan BIT, through recourse to binding, independent, international arbitration.\n\nIn addition, and in the alternative, should Article 8(3) of the instant Treaty be construed in such a manner as to in any way curtail or limit the access that a Chinese investor would otherwise enjoy (had it been a national of the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Australia or Germany), including the availability of access to arbitration under the Treaty itself, Sanum hereby invokes its right to receive treatment no less favorable than the Respondent has accorded to these third country investors, under Article 3(2) of the Treaty, as well.459\n\nAmended Notice, \u00b6 122-123.\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, in its Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction, under the heading \"Article 3(2) Grants Authority to the Tribunal To Hear All of Sanum\u2019s Claims\", the Claimant analyzes Article 3(2) of the Treaty but it does not include any analysis of the dispute settlement clauses in the BITs through which allegedly the MFN clause would operate. There is no analysis or specific preference expressed for any of them. While the BITs referred to by the Claimant are part of the record before the Tribunal, it would have been of assistance to the Tribunal had the analysis of Article 3(2) been complemented by an analysis of the dispute settlement clauses in the BITs listed in the Amended Notice.\n\n357.\n\nThe MFN clause in Article 3(2) refers to the treatment and protection in Article 3(1). Article 3(1) provides for fair and equitable treatment and protection of investments and activities associated with investments of investors. The Claimant has argued in favor of a broad meaning of the term \"protection\" under Article 3(1). On the other hand, the Claimant seems to realize that the term \"protection\" as used in Article 3(1) of the Treaty has a limited meaning. Indeed, the Claimant argues that, under the BITs of Laos with Germany, Korea and the United Kingdom, Laos has agreed to accord \"full protection and security\" and this obligation offers investors broader protection than that afforded under Article 3(1) of the Treaty. The Claimant does not discuss the implications of this statement for its reading of Article 3(1). In the view of the Tribunal, this argument shows that the Claimant considers it necessary to have recourse to the MFN clause to reach the level of protection afforded by the addition of the terms \"full\" and \"security\". In other words, the Claimant\u2019s argument on the application of the MFN clause contradicts the Claimant\u2019s broad reading of the term \"protection\" in Article 3(1) as including all protections under the Treaty. If this were the case, there would be no need to have recourse to the MFN clause to enjoy wider protection.\n\n358.\n\nThus, the position advanced by the Claimant requires the Tribunal, to (a) extend \"protection\" under Article 3(1) to all protections provided for in the Treaty; (b) extend through Article 3(2) the reach of Article 3(1); and, (c) go a step further and extend the reach of this clause to include access to arbitration in respect of disputes over a breach of all protections under the Treaty. Article 3(1) is limited in its scope and does not include the traditional formula of *full* protection and *security,* as the Claimant itself recognizes. In addition, to read into that clause a dispute settlement provision to cover all protections under the Treaty when the Treaty itself provides for very limited access to international arbitration would result in a substantial re-write of the Treaty and an extension of the States Parties\u2019 consent to arbitration beyond what may be assumed to have been their intention, given the limited reach of the Treaty protection and dispute settlement clauses. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that it has no jurisdiction for claims submitted under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.\n\n**5. Whether the Doctrines of** ***Lis Pendens*** **and Against the Abuse of Process Bar the Claims of the Claimant**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant has committed an abuse of process by submitting, as part of the Amended Notice, claims already made before in the Lao Holdings Arbitration. The Respondent further argues that these claims are inadmissible on grounds of *lis pendens.* The Respondent has requested that the Tribunal reject the amendments the Claimant has made in its Statement of Claim and Response on Jurisdiction on the basis of Articles 17 and 22 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n360.\n\nAccording to Article 17(1) of the Rules:\n\n[...] the arbitral tribunal may conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, provided that the parties are treated with equality and that at an appropriate stage of the proceedings each party is given a reasonable opportunity of presenting its case. The arbitral tribunal, in exercising its discretion, shall conduct the proceedings so as to avoid unnecessary delay and expense and to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving the parties\u2019 dispute.\n\n361.\n\nArticle 22 reads as follows:\n\nDuring the course of the arbitral proceedings, a party may amend or supplement its claim or defense, including a counterclaim or a claim for the purpose of a set-off, unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment or supplement having regard to the delay in making it or prejudice to other parties or any other circumstances. However, a claim or defense, including a counterclaim or a claim for the purpose of a set-off, may not be amended or supplemented in such a manner that the amended or supplemented claim or defense falls outside the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.\n\n362.\n\nThe Tribunal will address whether there have been delays or prejudice caused by the Amended Notice; whether the Respondent had the opportunity to present its case; whether *lis pendens* is an obstacle to admission of the claims in the Amended Notice; whether the amended claims are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; and, whether the Claimant has abused the process.\n\n363.\n\nIs the Amended Notice a cause for delay? Procedural Order No. 1 provided for the filing of an Amended Notice within ten days of the date of that order. The Amended Notice was filed on 7 June 2013 within the prescribed time. Therefore, it is self-evident that the Tribunal may not consider the Amended Notice to have caused any inappropriate delay.\n\n364.\n\nHas each Party had the opportunity to present its case? Suffice it to say here that the Amended Notice not only was filed in good time but also was filed nearly two months before the Statement of Claim and the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n365.\n\nHas the Amended Notice caused prejudice? It is undisputed that the Claimant offered to consolidate the two proceedings and the Respondent refused. Whatever the reasons for the Respondent\u2019s refusal, the Respondent is now precluded from claiming that it has been prejudiced. Whether it has or not is not a matter for the Tribunal to elucidate since consolidation was an option available to the Respondent.\n\n366.\n\nAre the claims introduced in the Amended Notice inadmissible on the grounds of *lis pendens* since they are the subject of a parallel proceeding? The Lao Holdings Arbitration is based on a different BIT and the claimant parties are related but different. The mere fact that the subject matter of the dispute may in some aspects overlap with these proceedings is not sufficient reason to reject the claims as inadmissible. As to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, to the extent that the Tribunal has determined that it has jurisdiction to consider only the expropriation claims before it, that jurisdiction encompasses only the expropriation claims that may be before the Lao Holdings tribunal.\n\n367.\n\nDoes the pursuit of overlapping claims in two different arbitral tribunals established under two different BITs by different parties constitute an abuse of process? As already observed above, it is undisputed that the Respondent refused to consolidate this proceeding and the Lao Holdings Arbitration. This fact is sufficient ground for the Tribunal to consider that there is no abuse of process.\n\n368.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal determines that the expropriation claims in the Amended Notice are properly before this Tribunal.\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n369.\n\nEach Party has requested that the costs of the proceedings, including its own costs, be borne by the other. The Tribunal reserves this question for consideration and decision along with the merits of the dispute.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n370.\n\nFor the reasons set out above the Tribunal decides:\n\ni) That the PRC/Laos BIT does apply to the Macao SAR.\n\nii) That Sanum is a protected investor under the BIT and its claims are investment-related.\n\niii) That the Tribunal has jurisdiction to arbitrate only the expropriation claims of Sanum under Article 8(3) of the BIT.\n\niv) That it has no jurisdiction to arbitrate Sanum\u2019s other claims by application of Article 3(2) of the BIT.\n\nv) To reject the Respondent\u2019s request to dismiss claims introduced by the Amended Notice which allegedly duplicate claims made in the Laos Holdings Arbitration.\n\nvi) To consider and decide the Parties\u2019 requests in respect of costs together with the merits of the dispute."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2019-08-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **FREQUENTLY USED ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS** | |\n| **Abbreviation** | **Meaning** |\n| BIT or Treaty | Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated 31 January 1993 |\n| BIT II Proceedings | Proceedings between *Lao Holdings N.V. v.

OVERVIEW**\n---------------\n\n1.\n\nMr. John Baldwin and Mr. Shawn Scott, two U.S. entrepreneurs who were experienced in a number of businesses including gambling facilities, became involved in casinos and slot machines in Laos in 2007. For this purpose, they caused two companies to be incorporated in Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles **Lao Holdings NV** (\"**LHNV**\"), and a subsidiary **Sanum Investments** (\"**Sanum**\") in Macau (collectively referred to as \"the **Claimants**\"). Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Scott, using various corporate structures partnered with a Laotian conglomerate (\"**ST Holdings**\") in two casino projects and three slot machine clubs in Laos positioned near its border with Thailand. One of the casinos, the **Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino** (\"**Savan Vegas**\"), was built and operated successfully. The second casino, **Paksong Vegas Casino** (\"**Paksong Vegas**\"), was never built.\n\n2.\n\nWithin three years there was a falling out between the Claimants and their local partners. ST Holdings ceased cooperation with Sanum, initiated litigation against it and shut Sanum out of Thanaleng, the most profitable of the slot clubs. Mr. John Baldwin testified that ST Holdings was closely connected to leading politicians in the Respondent Government. He said that ST Holdings orchestrated a series of wrongful Government acts against LHNV which led to the result, designed by the Government, of driving Sanum out of Laos and appropriating for the Government the wealth created by the investment and expertise of Mr. Baldwin and his associated companies.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants initiated arbitrations by LHNV under the bilateral investment treaties between Laos and the Netherlands,1 and by Sanum pursuant to a similar investment treaty between Laos and Macau (now China).2 These arbitrations have consumed multiple proceedings and years of litigation. Eventually Sanum obtained an award against ST Holdings from the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\"**SIAC**\") for over US $200 million. LHNV is not a claimant before this Tribunal, and the Tribunal does not purport to address its claims. However, much of the evidence of Mr. John Baldwin is related to both companies, and as he was the directing mind of both companies, and their principal witness, references will be made to LHNV from time to time (or collectively to \"**the Claimants**\" in the plural) as part of the background to the disposition of the Sanum claims. Moreover, counsel for the Claimants advised that it did not withdraw \"any factual allegations, as the **totality of the facts remain relevant to certain treaty breaches** for which the Claimants will seek relief.\"3\n\n*Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the Kingdom of the Netherlands*, signed on 16 May 2003, in force since 1 May 2005.\n\n*Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of The Lao People's Democratic Republic Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments*, dated 31 January 1993, as amended on 10 April 2006.\n\nLetter dated 26 March 2018 from Claimant to the Tribunal.\n\n**2. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal has issued the following decisions during the proceeding: (i) Award on Jurisdiction of 13 December 2013; (ii) Interim Ruling on Issues Arising Under the Deed of Settlement of 19 December 2014 and (iii) Decision on the Merits of the Claimant's Second Material Breach Application of 15 December 2017 (\"**Decision on the Second Material Breach**\"). The full procedural history of this case is described in these decisions. These Decisions, and the Decision on the Second Material Breach, are an integral part of the Award.\n\n5.\n\nThe procedural details of this arbitration following the Decision on the Second Material Breach are summarized below.\n\n6.\n\nIn the Decision on the Second Material Breach, the Tribunal ruled as follows:\n\n(a) the Second Material Breach Application is allowed;\n\n(b) pursuant to Section 32 of the Settlement, the Treaty arbitration is revived on the basis jointly and severally of the Government's breaches of:\n\n(i) Section 8, which promised a \"new flat tax\", but instead the Government imposed a 28% *ad valorem* tax on gross gaming revenues;\n\n(ii) Section 23, which promised the Claimant relief from \"current criminal investigations,\" which nevertheless have been revived;\n\n(c) both of these breaches constitute material breaches that deprived the Claimant of the intended benefits (or \"bargain\") promised by each of Section 8 and Section 23;\n\n(d) except as aforesaid, the grounds of revival relied on by the Claimant are rejected;\n\n(e) the parties are instructed to confer and propose to the Tribunal a timetable for the renewed arbitration within 30 days of the date of this decision;\n\n(f) a pre-hearing teleconference to resolve any outstanding issues will be held within 45 days of the date of this decision;\n\n(g) the issue of costs is reserved to be dealt with at the conclusion of the hearing on the merits.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 14 January 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunals of its intention to propose a timetable for the renewed Treaty arbitrations, as requested by the Tribunals' Decisions on the Merits of the Claimant's Second Material Breach Applications of 15 December 2017. By the same letter, the Claimant requested that the Tribunals in the revived arbitration be set for a merits hearing to take place at a reasonable time after the scheduled hearing of related but separate proceedings, identified as *Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People's Democratic Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/2)/ *Sanum Investments Limited v. Lao People's Democratic Republic* (ICSID Case No. ADHOC/17/1) (the \"**BIT II Proceedings**\"), and proposed an in-person pre-hearing conference, to explore with the Tribunals how to proceed and to receive any instructions the Tribunals may have.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 18 January 2018, the Respondent objected to the Tribunals' Interim Decision on the Claimant's Second Material Breach Applications. By the same letter, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's suggestion that the hearings for the revived proceedings be delayed until the conclusion of the BIT II Proceedings. The Respondent proposed a hearing schedule and stated its desire to complete the original disputes as soon as possible.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 26 January 2018, the Claimant provided further comments regarding the basis for a post-January 2019 hearing.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 30 January 2018, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment, should it wish, on the Claimant's assertions concerning the matters raised in the letter dated 26 January 2018. The Respondent provided its response by letter dated 9 February 2018.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated 19 February 2018, the Tribunal issued directions for the Parties to \"confer regarding a schedule for the exchange of submissions and other logistical matters.\"\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 2 March 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that no consensus had been reached and detailed the Parties' discussions on the schedule.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 8 March 2018, the PCA informed the Parties that in order to resolve outstanding matters, the Tribunal would hold a teleconference on 21 March 2018 at 12 noon Washington, D.C. time.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 19 March 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the Parties' positions with respect to the agenda for the telephone conference, noting any areas of agreement reached between the Parties and setting forth the discussion on matters not in agreement.\n\n15.\n\nOn 21 March 2018, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter dated 26 March 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal and the Respondent of the claims for which they would no longer seek specific relief and clarified the claims they were still pursing.\n\n17.\n\nOn 29 March 2018, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 8** on the organization of the hearing.\n\n18.\n\nOn 24 April 2018, the Respondent confirmed that it maintained its defences.\n\n19.\n\nBy email dated 16 May 2018, the Respondent submitted its list of witnesses to be called for examination at the merits hearing in Singapore scheduled for 3 to 7 September 2018.\n\n20.\n\nBy email dated 15 May 2018, the Respondent submitted its Application for Additional Evidence and Index of Additional Evidence, together with an index of supporting documentation and Exhibits R-001-002, R-004, R-028-029, R-034-036, C-1053, and R-054-055 and three additional documents not identified for the record.\n\n21.\n\nBy email dated 17 May 2018, each Party submitted its preliminary list of witnesses to be called for examination at the hearing to be taking place between 3-7 September 2018.\n\n22.\n\nOn 30 May 2018, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent's Application for Additional Evidence together with Exhibits C-1225 to C-1227, and Legal Authorities CL-379 to CL-389.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of 31 May 2018, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant to inform it on order of presentation of the witnesses to be examined at the scheduled hearing. Additionally, the Respondent requested the examination from Lao PDR *via* video-link of the following witnesses: Minister Kmabay Damlath, Dr. Sinlavong Khoutphaythoun, and Minister Chaleune Yiapaoheu.\n\n24.\n\nOn 6 June 2018, the Tribunal provided further instructions to the Parties regarding the submissions on the list of witnesses for cross-examination at the scheduled hearing. On 8 June 2018, the Claimant filed its response opposing the Respondent's request for the witnesses' video-link testimony, together with Exhibits C-1224, C-1235 and Legal Authority CL-390.\n\n25.\n\nOn 15 June 2018, the Respondent filed its reply to its Application for Additional Evidence. On this same date, the Claimant filed its objection to the Respondent's preliminary witness list, pointing out that the Respondent had not indicated the intended purpose or subjects of one of the witnesses' cross-examination, together with Exhibit C-1237.\n\n26.\n\nOn 22 June 2018, the Respondent filed its response to the Claimant's opposition to the examination of witnesses *via* video-link.\n\n27.\n\nOn 25 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, in which it ruled on the Respondent's Application for Additional Evidence.\n\n28.\n\nOn 26 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, on the Respondent's request for the examination of witnesses *via* video-link.\n\n29.\n\nOn 27 June 2018, the Respondent filed a request for clarification of Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 9. On this same date, it stated its agreement to the full consolidation of the present arbitration with the matter chaired by the Honorable Ian Binnie QC, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Lao Holdings NV *v. Lao People's Democratic Republic* (the \"**ICSID Proceedings**\")*.*\n\n30.\n\nOn 28 June 2018, the Tribunal issued an amended Procedural Order No. 9, in which certain typographical errors were corrected.\n\n31.\n\nBy letter of 28 June 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Claimant's request objecting the Respondent's witness list was approved and invited the Parties to submit their final witness lists.\n\n32.\n\nOn 5 July 2018, the Tribunal addressed the Respondent's communication of 27 June 2018, concerning its agreement to the full consolidation of this proceeding with the ICSID Proceeding. In this communication, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it did not consider the consolidation as \"practical or necessary at this late stage of the proceeding\".\n\n33.\n\nOn 6 July 2018, each Party submitted its final witness list for the hearing of 3 to 7 September 2018.\n\n34.\n\nBy email dated 6 July 2018, the Respondent confirmed that there were no changes to its witness list of 16 May 2018, with the exception of one witness in accordance with the Tribunal's decision contained in its letter of 28 June 2018.\n\n35.\n\nOn 9 July 2018, the Parties jointly requested the Tribunal for a one-day extension for the further deadlines in the organization of the hearing. On 11 July 2018, the Tribunal took note of the Parties' agreed extensions.\n\n36.\n\nOn 17 July 2018, the Claimant submitted a request for additional evidence to rebut the Respondent's additional evidence pursuant to the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 9.\n\n37.\n\nOn 18 July 2018, the Claimant submitted a request to substitute Dr. Thomas Zitt for Mr. Steven Rittvo for examination on the Innovation Group's Expert Report at the scheduled hearing, together with Exhibit C-1267 and Exhibits A to F. On the same date, the Respondent submitted its objection to the Claimant's request together with Exhibits 1 through 12. On 19 July 2018, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit its comments to the Respondent's objection. On 25 July 2018, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent's objection of 24 July 2018, together with Exhibits G through L.\n\n38.\n\nOn 25 July 2018, the Respondent filed its observations to the Claimant's request for additional evidence of 17 July 2018. The Claimant's filed its reply on support of its request on 26 July 2018.\n\n39.\n\nOn 26 July 2018, the Respondent filed additional observations to the Claimant's request for the substitution of experts of 18 July 2018.\n\n40.\n\nOn 31 July 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 deciding that the scheduled hearing would proceed on all issues except for damages and quantum and ruled on the Claimant's request for the substitution of experts to give testimony at the hearing. Simultaneously, the Tribunal issued and Procedural Order No. 13 on the Claimant's request for additional evidence as follows:\n\n\"1. The following documents submitted by the Claimants are admitted on consent:\n\nExhibits R-049, C-1240, R-046, C-1241, C-1242, C-0928, C-1243, C-1131, C-1244, C-1245, C-1246, C-774, C-755, C-1226, C-1248, C-1249, C-1250, C-1251, R-026, C-1238 A, C-1238 B, C-1239, C-1256, C-1257, C-1258, C-1259, C-1260, C-1261, C-1262, C-1263, C-1264, C-1265, C-1266.\n\n2. The Tribunal admits the extracts of the Witness statements of John Baldwin, Angus Noble, William Greenlee and Clay Crawford submitted by the Claimants, but permits the Government to provide additional extracts from the same witness statements which the Government contends are necessary to give \"balance\" to the extracts submitted by the Claimants, as per the ruling in item 1 above.\n\n3. The Baldwin Statement (Exhibit C-1244) and the Kurlantzick Report (Exhibit C-1247) are not admitted into evidence.\n\n4.

On 26 August 2018, the Respondent filed its observations to this request.\n\n50.\n\nOn 28 August 2018, the Respondent withdrew the witness statement of Mr. Vanheung (Vanheuang) Nanthachak from the record.\n\n51.\n\nOn 29 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, on (1) Respondent's request to strike from the record Mr. William Greenlee's witness statements; (2) Respondent's request to introduce exhibits SRE-164 and SRE-165; (3) Claimant's request to extend the time assigned at the hearing; (4) Claimant's request to exclude the BDO Report submitted by the Respondent, and (5) Claimant's request for advance notice for witness examination. These issues were decided as follows:\n\n\"1. The Respondent's request to strike from the record Mr. William Greenlee's witness statements is premature.\n\n2. Exhibits SRE-164 and SRE-165 are to be admitted into evidence.\n\n3. Each party shall have equal time and is to determine the order in which its own cross-examinations proceed as well as time allocation.\n\n4. The Claimants' request to exclude from the record the 291 additional pages attached to the BDO Report contained in Exhibit SRE-161 is granted.\n\n5. The Parties are not required to provide advance notice of topics to be covered in cross-examination.\"\n\n52.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confer and provide to the Tribunal a final hearing schedule.\n\n53.\n\nOn 30 August 2018, the Claimant submitted the Parties' final and agreed hearing schedule.\n\n54.\n\nA hearing on the merits was held at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore, from 3 to 7 September 2018 (the \"**Hearing**\"). As on previous occasions, the Tribunal conducted the hearing jointly with the Tribunal in the ICSID Proceedings. At no time were the ICSID proceedings and the PCA proceedings consolidated.

OVERVIEW OF THE FACTS**\n----------------------------\n\n**3.1. Laos: The Claimants' Investments in Laos**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, LHNV, owned directly and indirectly through its subsidiary, Sanum, gambling assets in Laos, including the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino Complex in Savannakhet Province. The Casino is strategically located near the Friendship Bridge which spans the Mekong River between Laos and Thailand. The Claimants also had an investment in \"slot clubs\" located at the Thai border at Lao Bao and Savannakhet Ferry Terminal (located at the Savannakhet/Mukdahan checkpoint), all in the Savannakhet Province and at Thanaleng to the Northwest. LHNV and its subsidiary Sanum, claim to have invested many millions of dollars in these projects.4\n\nThe Claimants' principal, Mr. John Baldwin, testified as follows:  \nQ.... Can you tell us when Sanum first invested in Laos and what kind of money it invested, at what time period?  \nA. We - we started investing in Laos in 2007. Our initial commitment was a total of seven and a half million dollars - my recollection is seven and a half million dollars paid to ST Group in various stages, and then the next thing we invested in was getting new plans drawn and studies done for Savan Vegas and Paksong Vegas.  \nQ. And in what year was that done?  \nA. That was done in 2008 primarily.  \nQ. When was the first monies paid? 2007 or 2008?  \nA. First monies, 2007.  \nQ. And then the money that was in 2008, can you say during roughly what month?  \nA. Well, the largest amount of money was paid prior to the Savan - was paid in probably the last six months of 2008.  \nQ. During all of that time in 2007 and 2008, did you have a flat tax agreement yet?  \nA. Yes.  \nQ. Prior - let me show you some documents. Let me show you -  \nA. Well, we had an agreement to get the flat tax agreement. The flat tax was approved - the flat tax was approved by Prime Minister Bouasone in [29 December 2008].  \nTranscript, 5 September 2018, p. 134, l. 10 to p. 135, l. 12, date corrected p. 135, ll. 9-12.\n\n**3.2. The Original Treaty Claims**\n-----------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants allege expropriation without compensation and Treaty breaches in respect of their investment in gambling projects described in the Project Development Agreement (\"**PDA**\") dated 10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, as well as the three slot clubs, Thanaleng, Lao Bao and Savannakhet Ferry. The claims also relate to the expected expansion of the Savannakhet Airport and opportunities for development in the Special Economic Zone at Thakhet.\n\n64.\n\nOn 14 August 2012, Sanum Investments Limited, a LHNV subsidiary which operated the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, initiated its claim before the PCA for alleged violations of the *Agreement between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of The Lao People's Democratic Republic Concerning The Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments,* dated 31 January 1993 and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010.\n\n65.\n\nAlso on 14 August 2012, LHNV initiated its ICSID proceedings against the Respondent, before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") pursuant to the *Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the Kingdom of the Netherlands*,5 and the *Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility)* of ICSID (\"**ICSID-AF Rules**\").6\n\nSigned on 16 May 2003, in force since 1 May 2005.\n\nAs amended on 10 April 2006.\n\n66.\n\nWhile the proceedings before the two Tribunals are distinct and separate, the proceedings were the subject of joint hearings in Singapore and elsewhere. Accordingly, for ease of reference only, LHNV and Sanum will be referred to as \"the Claimants\", as the facts of the cases are intermingled. This terminology is not to suggest, however, that the two arbitral proceedings are consolidated or otherwise conjoined.\n\n**3.3. Claims and Counterclaims**\n---------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimants' original Treaty claims were based on a multiplicity of alleged treaty breaches by the Government including (but not limited to) an 80% tax on casino revenues and what the Claimants contended were unfair and oppressive audits of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. In addition, the Claimants alleged that the Government abused its sovereign authority to assist ST Holdings to acquire other assets which belonged in whole or in part, to the Claimants. In the Treaty proceedings, the Claimants eventually valued their investment loss as of 31 August 2016 at between US $690 million and US $1 billion.7\n\nSee Reports of Joseph P. Kalt dated 14 October 2016, 2 December 2016, 22 December 2016 and 15 March 2017.\n\n**3.4. The Settlement and its Aftermath**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Treaty claims were thought to have been resolved by a Deed of Settlement concluded between the Parties during the merits hearing in Singapore on 15 June 2014 (to be read together with a Side Letter dated 18 June 2014) (herein referred to collectively as \"**the Settlement**\").\n\n69.\n\nShortly after the Settlement, the Claimants alleged that the Government had committed a material breach of its terms which entitled them to a revival of the Treaty arbitrations (\"**the First Material Breach Application**\"). The Government contested jurisdiction. On 11 August 2014, the Government filed a Notice of Arbitration with the SIAC pursuant to paragraphs 35 and 42 of the Settlement, seeking an order directing Sanum to comply with its obligations under the Settlement.\n\n70.\n\nThe ICSID and PCA Tribunals held a hearing on 14 October 2014 in Washington, D.C. on the objections to jurisdiction, which were dismissed. However, on 20 January 2015, the High Court of the Republic of Singapore held that the PCA Tribunal did not possess subject matter jurisdiction under the Laos-China BIT because of the status of Macau and issues of state succession not here relevant, as well as the limitation in the BIT, according to which \"only disputes over the amount of compensation for expropriation can be submitted to arbitration.\"8 This judgment was later reversed by the Court of Appeal of Singapore on 29 September 2016.9\n\n*Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic v. Sanum Investments Ltd*., [2015] SGHC 15 at para. 128.\n\n*Sanum Investments Ltd. v. Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic*, [2016] SGCA 57.\n\n**3.5. Delimitation of the Relief Presently Sought by the Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimants' Second Material Breach Application was successful, and on 15 December 2017, the Hearing on the merits of the \"revived\" claim was ordered to proceed. On 26 March 2018, the Claimants advised the Tribunal of the claims for which they no longer sought relief, namely, in respect of the PCA proceedings, \"Article 6 expropriation claim regarding the [Savan Vegas], its Article 6 expropriation claim regarding Ferry Terminal or Lao Bao slot clubs [\u2026], or its claims regarding Respondent's seizure of its bank account in breach of Articles 3(2), 3(4), 4, 5, and 6.\"10\n\nLetter dated 26 March 2018 from Claimant to the Tribunal.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants' letter of 26 March 2018 notionally divided and separated their claims concerning LHNV (Thanaleng, Savan Vegas and the Ferry Terminal and Lao Bao slots) and Sanum (Thanaleng, Paksan, Thakhet and Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino). As mentioned, however, counsel for the Claimants asserted in the same letter that \"the totality of the facts remain relevant to certain treaty breaches for which the Claimants will seek relief.\" Equally, the Respondent conjoined its \"clean hands\" defence to all claims by both Claimants at issue in the ICSID and PCA proceedings involving Mr. John Baldwin and the various interrelated allegations of bribery and corruption. Accordingly, it will be necessary for the Tribunal to address \"the totality\" of the factual circumstances of the listed projects of both Claimants insofar as they are relevant to the position of Sanum.\n\n73.\n\nSanum maintained the expropriation claim pursuant to Article 4 of the Treaty regarding the Thanaleng slot club, Paksan, Thakhet and the Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino.\n\n**4. RELEVANT ARTICLES OF THE BIT**\n-----------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Preamble to the Treaty provides, in relevant part:\n\nThe Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic (hereinafter referred to as Contracting States), Desiring to encourage, protect and create favorable conditions for investment by investors of one Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State based on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit and for the purpose of the development of economic cooperation between both States [...]\n\n75.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the Treaty provides, in relevant part:\n\nThe term \"investments\" means every kind of asset invested by investors of one Contracting State in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting State in the territory of the latter, including mainly (a) movable and immovable property and other property rights; (b) shares in companies or other forms of interest in such companies; (c) a claim to money or to any performance having an economic value; (d) copyrights, industrial property, know-how and technological process; (e) concessions conferred by law, including concessions to search for or to exploit natural resources.\n\n76.\n\nArticle 1(2)(b) of the Treaty provides, in relevant part:\n\nThe term \"investors\" means: In respect of both Contracting States: [\u2026] (b) economic entities established in accordance with the laws and regulations of each contracting State.\n\n77.\n\nArticle 3(1) and 3(2) of the Treaty provide:\n\n(1) Investments and activities associated with investments of investors of either Contracting State shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy protection in the territory of the other Contracting State.\n\n(2) The treatment and protection as mentioned in Paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be less favorable than that accorded to investments and activities associated with such investments of investors of a third State.\n\n78.\n\nArticle 4(1) and 4(2) of the Treaty provide:\n\n(1) Neither Contracting State shall expropriate, nationalize or take similar measures (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") against investments of investors of the other Contracting state in its territory, unless the following conditions are met:\n\n(a) as necessitated by the public interest;\n\n(b) in accordance with domestic legal procedures;\n\n(c) without discrimination;\n\n(d) against appropriate and effective compensation.\n\n(2) The compensation mentioned in paragraph 1(d) of this Article shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated investments at the time when expropriation is proclaimed, be convertible and freely transferable. The compensation shall be paid without unreasonable delay.\n\n79.\n\nArticle 8(1), 8(2), and 8(3) of the Treaty provide:\n\n(1) Any dispute between an investor of one Contracting State and the other Contracting State in connection with an investment in the territory of the other Contracting State shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through negotiation between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(2) If the dispute cannot be settled through negotiation within six months, either party to the dispute shall be entitled to submit the dispute to the competent court of the Contracting State accepting the investment.\n\n(3) If a dispute involving the amount of compensation for expropriation cannot be settled through negotiation within six months as specified in paragraph 1 of this Article, it may be submitted at the request of either party to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if the investor concerned has resorted to the procedure specified in the paragraph 2 of this Article.\n\n**5. OTHER MATTERS**\n--------------------\n\n**5.1. Other Legal Provisions**\n-------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, in addition to the BIT, domestic law is relevant to the existence of the Claimants' contractual rights and the legality of the conduct of the foreign investors. Furthermore, there are international norms such as \"[t]he United Nations Convention Against Corruption which defines bribery and money laundering as fundamental criminal offenses that undermine the international system of foreign trade.\"11 It is the contention of the Respondent that the Claimants violated the BIT, the laws of Laos and international norms.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 20.\n\n81.\n\nAccording to the Claimant Sanum's Reply, the \"[BIT] clearly governs this dispute.\"12 The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (\"**UNCAC**\") \"creates obligations only for the state Parties, to develop anti-corruption policies, practices, and task forces. It does not bind or purport to bind the conduct of entities such as the Claimant.\"13 The Claimants also question the Respondent's appeal to international public policy and, in particular, the international standard for the gaming industry based on domestic gaming regulations of just four jurisdictions, none of them applicable to the Claimants' projects in Laos.\n\nClaimant's Reply and Opposition to Respondent's Counterclaims dated 9 May 2014 (hereinafter \"**Claimant's Reply**\"), para. -237.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n82.\n\nWhile the Claimants admit that domestic statutes obviously do determine whether certain alleged acts are legal or illegal for the purposes of domestic law, domestic law does not dictate the consequences for an investor's claims under the Treaty.\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"once an investor has established its investment in conformity with the host state's laws, that investment falls within the scope of the treaty (assuming all of the other jurisdictional hurdles have been cleared), and the investor is *prima facie* entitled to its protections.\"14 The Claimants further argue that the cases that \"consider whether allegations of misconduct constitute a proper defence on the merits do not assist Laos because tribunals have required Respondents to demonstrate that the actions taken in breach of the treaty were actually justified by the misconduct.\"15\n\n*Ibid*., para. 246.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 249.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants also dispute the relevance of the \"uncontroversial proposition that arbitral tribunals have an inherent power to preserve the integrity of their own process...\"16 The Claimants equally reject the applicability of the \"unclean hands\" doctrine and note that the Respondent has not cited any case in which a tribunal has sanctioned post-investment behaviour with a full dismissal of the Claimant's case.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 252.\n\n**5.2. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe law to be applied by the Tribunal is determined by the Treaty. The Treaty is an international instrument that to the extent it requires interpretation will be interpreted by the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties (\"**VCLT**\") to which both State parties to the Treaty have acceded. As the Parties admit in their exchanges, the domestic law of the State may also be relevant. The extent of its relevance is a matter of dispute between the Parties, particularly on the question of whether to be protected an investment needs to be made *and operated* according to the law of the host State. This issue and the disputed applicability of international policy relate to the defence of illegal conduct and the Tribunal will address both matters as needed in its consideration of the Respondent's defence.\n\n**5.3. Clarification on the Nature of the Respondent's Illegality Claims**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nAs part of its defence, the Respondent has pleaded that the Tribunal should dismiss all claims because of the illegal activities in which the Claimants allegedly engaged, including bribery, embezzlement and money laundering. The Claimants have at times characterized this defence as a \"request for dismissal.for lack of jurisdiction\" because at inception or in its operation the investment of the Claimants was illegal.17\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 13.\n\n87.\n\nAs the Tribunal understands it, the present submission of the Respondent to dismiss all claims on grounds of illegality is not an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, but an affirmation of the Tribunal's jurisdiction to consider the claims on their merits which, the Government says, ought to be dismissed because of the Claimants' illegal conduct.\n\n**6. THE RESPONDENT'S THRESHOLD POSITION IS THAT THE CLAIMS OUGHT NOT TO BE ENTERTAINED BY REASON OF THE CLAIMANTS' BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nAt the threshold of its argument, the Respondent contends that the claims should be dismissed in their entirety, in part because of corruption in the creation of the investments, and in part because of corruption in the course of performance of the various PDAs and unsuccessful initiatives by the Claimants to obtain licences for new gambling facilities.\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the principals behind the Claimants, Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Sean Scott, were quite brazen about how to do business in a culture of corruption. However, Mr. Baldwin says, they steadfastly resisted. In this respect, Mr. Baldwin testified that:\n\nLaos can be quite a corrupt country... As I met fellow businessmen in Laos, I came to realize that almost every major business operating in Laos has paid money under the table for their concessions, or their flat tax agreements or other Government approvals. Sanum, however, has not.18\n\nJohn Baldwin Second Witness Statement dated 9 May 2014, para. 5.\n\n90.\n\nIn his re-examination at the Hearing, Mr. John Baldwin made an even more emphatic denial of corrupt activities: \"I gave strict instructions always that we weren't paying any bribes.\"19\n\nMr. Baldwin testified as follows in re-examination by his counsel:  \nQ. Mr. Branson asked you a number of questions about the contracts, the consulting contracts, that Mr. Bouker had that Marty Gersten had written up and you said you hadn't seen them, but now that you've seen them, do they cause you to believe that Mr. Bouker was being dispatched to go and bribe people?  \nA. No.  \nQ. And why is that?  \nA. Well, first and foremost, **I gave strict instructions always that we weren't paying any bribes**. That's number one. I just don't do it and I'm a stubborn guy and I just don't - I tell my staff the same thing always, you know, it's a slippery slope and you can't start down it, so that's number one. But number two is, you know, fair value [in terms of a success fee] for result for work given. I mean, if he [Mr. Bowker] has the contacts to do this, more power to him. (emphasis added)  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 168, ll. 8-19.\n\n91.\n\nThe allegations of bribery in the course of making the initial investment include:\n\n(a) an alleged bribe of US $30,000 to Laotian tax authorities to obtain approval of the original 2009 Flat Tax Agreement which the Claimants regarded as essential to their investment in their flagship Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino project;\n\n(b) payment of US $25,000 to Government officials to procure a licence for the Claimants' proposed Thakhaek Slot Club and Welcome Centre.20\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras. 10-11, 15-17.\n\n92.\n\nThe allegations of bribery in the course of performance of the PDAs and related initiatives include:\n\n(a) payment of US $875,000 to the Claimants' consultant in the Laos private sector, Madam Sengkeo Phimmasone, to bribe Government officials to stop an audit by Ernst & Young (\"**E&Y**\") of Savan Vegas in order to avoid disclosure of the Claimants' illegal activity21 and witness tampering (Madam Sengkeo Phimmasone refused to make herself available to testify in these proceedings. The Respondent alleges she was paid by the Claimants to stay away);\n\n(b) payment of bribes totalling US $21,000 in 2012 to Government officials in an effort to obtain an extension of the 2009 Flax Tax Agreement;22\n\n(c) offer of a US $7 million bribe to the Prime Minister of Laos for approval of a licence to establish a casino in the capital city of Vientiane;23\n\n(d) a bribe of US $80,000 to the Governor of the Province of Champasak to approve a slot club at Chong Mek;24\n\n(e) bribes totalling US $106,000 to Government officials to close the Paksan Slot Club as a way of bringing pressure on ST Holdings to settle their differences;25\n\n(f) a claim (now abandoned) of payment of unspecified amounts of bribes to Government officials stationed at Savan Vegas to turn a blind eye to unlawful gambling by Lao citizens;26\n\n(g) an allegation (now abandoned) of payment of unspecified amounts to Thai border officials to facilitate Thai gamblers crossing into Laos to gamble and return unhindered with their winnings;27 and\n\n(h) additional allegations (now abandoned) that the Claimants engaged in money laundering and embezzled funds from Savan Vegas by use of phoney loans.28\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 73; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 9(i) and (vii).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 90-93; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 10,15, 19.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 97.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 100-101; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 21-22.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 102-104.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 110-113.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 114.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 115-199, 133, 135, 338.\n\n93.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants paid US $120,000 to Cambodian officials for a Cambodian lottery licence, bribed Cambodian officials to obtain Cambodian diplomatic passports and bribed Cambodian customs officials to ignore unlawful border crossings. These allegations were designed to demonstrate that the principals of the Claimants are \"bad people\" with a predisposition to use bribery and corruption to advance their financial interests. The facts underlying the Cambodian allegations are so far removed from the allegations of corruption in Laos, that the allegations relating to Cambodia will not be considered further.\n\n**6.1. Evidence of Bribery and Corruption is Relevant Both at the Time of Investment and During Subsequent Performance**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Parties agree that investment tribunals are rightly sensitive to allegations of corruption. They agree that the Respondent bears the burden of proof. They disagree on the standard of proof, *i.e.* whether a balance of probabilities is sufficient or whether corruption must be established to the more demanding standard of \"clear and convincing evidence\" of corruption. They also, of course, disagree on the facts.\n\n95.\n\nThere is no doubt that bribery and corruption are contrary to the domestic laws of Laos.29\n\n**Lao Penal Code**  \nArticle 157:  \nAny person bribing or agreeing to bribe a civil servant shall be punished by six months to two years of imprisonment and a fine equal to the amount or value of the bribe.  \nIn the event of a substantial bribe, the bribed civil servant, the briber and the person who agrees to give the bribe shall be punished by three to five years of imprisonment and fines equal to twice the amount or value of the bribe.  \nBribe intermediaries shall be punished by six months to two years of imprisonment and fines equal to the amount or value of the bribe.  \nLHRA-15.  \n**Lao Law on Investment Promotion**  \nArticle 73: Prohibited actions for investors:  \nInvestors are prohibited to perform the following actions:  \n1. Give bribes to officers and government officials who have responsibilities for concerned tasks; LHRA-21 **.**\n\n**6.1.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimants are not legally entitled to maintain any of their claims in these proceedings as a matter of *ordre public international* and public policy.30 Corruption, the Respondent argues, is relevant to the initial investment but also to the investor's subsequent conduct in relation to the investment in the host country.31\n\n*World Duty Free Company Limited v. Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, Award (\"***World Duty Free v. Kenya***\"), at para. 188(3), LHRA-31.\n\nReferencing ICC Dossier: *Addressing Issues of Corruption in Commercial and Investment Arbitration*, Chapter 11, at para. 31, LHRA-155 (citing *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich A.G. and Gesti\u00f3n e Ingenier\u00eda IDC S.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/19, Award, 18 November 2014, at paras. 129-132):  \n31.The approach to bribery is different in investment arbitrations, where jurisdiction does not derive from a contract, but rather from an investment treaty. In these cases, validity of contracts is not the question. The issue is whether an investor who has incurred in corrupt practices when making or performing the investment can still enjoy protection under the relevant investment treaty. And the answer is no. (38) Investment arbitration has initiated and led the movement of zero tolerance towards corruption.\n\n97.\n\nThe difference is that corruption in the making of the investment will raise issues of jurisdiction for the Tribunal, whereas subsequent acts of corruption will go to a claimant's entitlement for relief under the BIT.32\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, at para. 345, LHRA-29:\n\n98.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent relies on the analysis in *Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan* :\n\nWhile reaching the conclusion that the claims are barred as a result of corruption, the Tribunal is sensitive to the ongoing debate that findings on corruption often come down heavily on claimants, while possibly exonerating defendants that may have themselves been involved in the corrupt acts. It is true that the outcome in cases of corruption often appears unsatisfactory because, at first sight at least, it seems to give an unfair advantage to the defendant party. The idea, however, is not to punish one party at the cost of the other, but rather to ensure the promotion of the rule of law, which entails that a court or tribunal cannot grant assistance to a party that has engaged in a corrupt act.33 (emphasis added)\n\nRespondent's Opening Submission, Slide 143, citing *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, at para. 389, Exhibit LHRA-157.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent also relies, more generally, on the doctrine of \"clean hands\". The Claimants' misconduct is sufficient, it is said, to deny them the assistance of investor-state arbitration.\n\n**6.1.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is founded on the BIT and neither the Netherlands nor the Chinese BIT contains a provision authorizing a tribunal to deny the treaty's protection on the basis that the claimant/investor engaged in corruption. If the BITs provide no authority to dismiss, the Tribunal would have to base its decision on customary international law. However, the lack of \"clean hands\" is neither a recognized rule of customary international law nor a general principle of international law and thus affords no authority to dismiss.34\n\nCiting *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation*, UNCITRAL PCA Case No. AA 227, Award, 18 July 2014, at paras. 1362-1363, CLA(B)-395.\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that corruption in **the establishment of an investment** can render a claim inadmissible because treaty protections are only available for valid investments recognized under the treaty (based upon either an explicit or implied legality requirement).35 The Claimants deny corruption but in any event deny any causal connection between the acts of *alleged* corruption and these claims. The Respondent only concocted its corruption allegations **after** the arbitrations were commenced and in any event has failed to govern itself in a manner consistent with its international obligations, including due process and good faith, and the prosecution of bribe-takers as well as alleged bribe-givers.36\n\nClaimant's Closing Submission, Slide 3.\n\nClaimant's Opening Submission on Respondent's Corruption Allegations, Slide 4.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants' principal, Mr. John Baldwin, denied the applicability of the \"red flags\" approach to the investments in issue here:\n\nQ. Is it possible that when you enter into a consulting contract like this, that if the event is achieved, the consultant is sent the money and the consultant then is instructed to pay it to certain government ministers so that it keeps the company one step removed from proof of the bribe? Isn't that how it works, Mr Baldwin?\n\nA. That's a possibility, although it didn't happen here.37\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 91, 16-25.\n\n**6.1.3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that proof of corruption at any stage of the investment may be relevant depending on the circumstances. While the UNCAC applies to States rather than private parties, it embodies what has become a principle of customary international law applicable, according to the OECD, to root out corruption used \"to **obtain** or **retain business** or other undue advantage **in relation to the conduct** of international business.\"38\n\n*UN Convention Against Corruption, Article 16(1), LHRA-16. See also OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions*, Article 1(1), Exhibit LHRA-136:  \nEach Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish that it is a criminal offence under its law for any person intentionally to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other advantage, whether directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign public official, for that official or for a third party, in order that the official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of official duties, in order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in the conduct of international business. (emphasis added).  \nSee also ICC Dossier: *Addressing Issues of Corruption in Commercial and Investment Arbitration*, Chapter 11, at para. 34, Exhibit LHRA-155:  \nIt is now undisputed that a finding of corruption when making or performing an investment will lead to dismissal of claimant's claims and to a loss of any protection afforded by the treaty. (emphasis added)  \nRespondent's Opening Statement, Slide 146.\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on a generalized doctrine of \"clean hands\" which is a metaphor employed as a defence to equitable relief in common law jurisdictions. Incorporation of such a general doctrine into investor-State law without careful boundaries would risk opening investment disputes to an open-ended, vague and ultimately unmanageable principle. However, putting aside the label, serious financial misconduct by the Claimants incompatible with their good faith obligations as investors in the host country (such as criminality in defrauding the host Government in respect of an investment) is not without Treaty consequences, both in relation to their attempt to rely on the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment, as well as their entitlement to relief of any kind from an international tribunal*.*\n\n**6.2. The Applicable Standard of Proof**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**6.2.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent notes that many international tribunals have recognized the difficulty of \"proving\" bribery and corruption. In the nature of things, the parties to such transactions are generally careful to leave no paper trail or other direct or documentary evidence. As a result, if corruption is to be combatted effectively, it is necessary to rely on inferences from circumstantial evidence. A reasonable approach is to identify \"red flags\" which, if established, require the alleged perpetrators to provide an exculpatory explanation of otherwise suspicious conduct. In *Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan*,39 for example, the tribunal considered probative of corruption the Government's evidence of substantial payments to a consultant where:\n\n(a) the consultant lacks experience in the sector,\n\n(b) the consultant is not a resident of the country where the project is located;\n\n(c) the consultant has no significant business presence or experience within the country;\n\n(d) the consultant requests \"urgent\" payments and/or unusually high commissions;\n\n(e) the consultant requests payments be made in cash, be made in a third country, to a numbered bank account, or to some other person or entity than the one with whom the agreement was signed;\n\n(f) the consultant has a close personal/professional relationship to the Government that could improperly influence the decision.40\n\nMetal-Tech v. Uzbekistan, Exhibit LHRA-157, at para. 293. See also ICC Dossier *Addressing Issues of Corruption in Commercial and Investment Arbitration*, Chapter 5, Exhibit LHRA-160.\n\n*Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan*, Exhibit LHRA-157, para. 293.\n\n**6.2.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the applicable standard of proof of corruption in international law is \"**clear and convincing evidence**\" which must consist of \"substantial facts\" not mere \"inferences\".41 Relevance is placed on *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt,* where the tribunal held that \"the applicable standard of proof is greater than the balance of probabilities but less than beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The term favoured by the Claimants is \"**clear and convincing evidence**.\"42\n\n*Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/14, Award, 22 June 2010, Exhibit CLA(B)-441, at para. 424:  \n.... It is not sufficient to present evidence which could possibly indicate that there might have been or even probably was corruption. Rather Claimants have to *prove* corruption...[T]he issue is not one of inference, and the Tribunal considers that Claimants have not met their burden of proof in this regard.  \nSee also *Gustav FW Hamseter GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, Exhibit LHRA-26, at para. 134.\n\n*Waguih Elie George Siag & Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No ARB/05/15, Award, 1 June 2009, Exhibit CLA(LH)-069, at para. 326.\n\n**6.2.3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges the difficulty of proving corruption as well as the importance of exposing corruption where it exists. In the nature of the offence, the person offering the bribe and the person accepting it will take care to cover their tracks. Nevertheless, given the seriousness of the charge, and the severity of the consequences to the individuals concerned, procedural fairness requires that there be proof rather than conjecture. The standard of \"probabilities\" requires the trier of fact to stand back and make an overall assessment. The requirement of \"clear and convincing\" evidence puts the focus more closely on the building blocks of the evidence to ensure a rigorous testing.\n\n108.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, there need not be \"clear and convincing evidence\" on every element of every allegation of corruption, but such \"clear and convincing evidence\" as exists must point clearly to corruption. An assessment must then be made of which elements of the alleged act of corruption have been established by clear and convincing evidence, and which elements are left to reasonable inference, and on the whole whether the alleged act of corruption is established to a standard higher than the balance of probabilities but less than the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt, although, of course proof beyond reasonable doubt would be conclusive. This approach reflects the general proposition that the \"graver the charge, the more confidence there must be in the evidence relied on.\"43\n\n*See* *Libananco* v. *Turkey* (Exh. RLA-117), para. 125; *Rompetrol* v. *Romania* (Exh. RLA-233), para. 182; both relying on the Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in the *Oil Platforms* case, ICJ Reports 1996, at 856.\n\n**6.3. Failure of the Respondent to Investigate and Prosecute Persons who Allegedly Accepted Bribes**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nAs the Claimants point out, the Respondent has brought no prosecutions against any Government official said to be on the receiving end of the bribes. Nor is there before the Tribunal any evidence of a serious criminal investigation of anyone other than the principals of the Claimant, Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Sean Scott.\n\n110.\n\nConviction of its own officials would not estop the Government from pursuing the Claimants as bribe-givers.\n\n111.\n\nHowever, in this case, the Tribunal finds it disturbing that **no** prosecutions have been brought against **any** persons alleged to have accepted bribes, nor has there been evidence of due diligence in any investigation. These omissions are relevant to the credibility of the Government's allegations, as will be seen.\n\n**6.3.1. First Allegation - Bribes to Obtain the 2009 Flat Tax Agreement**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**6.3.1.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimants have repeatedly acknowledged that the Flat Tax Agreement (\"**FTA**\")44 was essential to the economic profitability of Savan Vegas. Mr. John Baldwin testified in Singapore that the Claimants would not have built the casino without an FTA:\n\nQ. And would you have built the Savan Vegas casino for $25 million, $30 million if that was the tax you had to pay, if the government refused to give you a flat tax agreement?\n\nA. No.45\n\nFlat Tax Agreement between Laos and Savan Vegas, dated 21 September 2009, Exhibit C(B)-007.\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 208, p. 89, 12-16.\n\n113.\n\nIt is alleged that to obtain the original 2009 FTA, a bribe of US $30,000 was paid to Ms. Manivone or Mr. Khamphai, senior officials with the Government tax department, through the Claimants' intermediary or consultant, Madam Sengkeo.\n\n114.\n\nThe FTA was of great value to the Claimants as it limited most types of tax to a flat sum of US $745,000 per year regardless of the profits made by the multi-million dollar casino operation.\n\n115.\n\nThe chronology is as follows:   \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **DATE** | **ACTIVITY** |\n| 29 December 2008 | Prime Minister approves FTA in principle |\n| 21 September 2009 | Flat Tax Agreement signed. |\n| 22 September 2009 | Internal Sanum e-mail records that Mr. Khamphai requested wire of \"agreed payment\" to Madam Sengkeo's account \"approved\" by Mr. Baldwin.46 |\n| 24 September 2009 | Internal Sanum e-mail records that **the** \"**tax people** are requesting [...] $30,000 USD [...] to get the flat tax approval.\"47 |\n| 7 October 2009 | Internal Sanum e-mail records that Madam Sengkeo \"has provided **her daughter's** bank account\" information.48 |\n| 8 October 2009 | Internal Sanum e-mail records that Mr. Baldwin instructed the disbursement of funds \"by wire\" for \"service[s] partially rendered\". Amounts of US $10,000 and US $20,000 were disbursed from the account \"by wire\".49 |\n\nEmails regarding Flat Tax, Exhibit SRE-152.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n116.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the sequence of dates, and the use of the daughter's bank account in lieu of Madam Sengkeo's own account, raise \"red flags\".\n\n117.\n\nWhile the FTA had been agreed to in principle in December 2008, Mr. John Baldwin testified that the deal was not done, because \"we needed to get the flat tax agreement reduced into a formal document at that specific time.\"50 Accordingly, it would have been quite understandable for the payment of a bribe to be delayed until October 2009 when the FTA was signed, as opposed to December 2008 when it was purportedly approved in principle by the Government.\n\nMr. John Baldwin testified as follows:  \nQ. What was the agreement's substance? I mean, the agreement with Madam Sengkeo, what was the substance of that agreement?  \nA. I believe - I - I don't know specifically, but I believe that we needed to get the flat tax agreement reduced into a formal document at that specific time, but Madam Sengkeo's engagement went back nearly a year, is my recollection, and that she helped, through that whole period, to get the flat tax agreement.  \nQ. What was the agreement? Why was she getting 30,000? Why not 50,000?  \nA. Well, she agreed to take $30,000.  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p.69, 16-25 to 70, 1-3.\n\n118.\n\nIn cross-examination, Mr. John Baldwin denied any illegal payment to Madam Sengkeo, but according to the Respondent, Mr. Baldwin's explanation that the reference to payment in October 2009 of US $30,000 to the \"**tax people**\" meant payment to Madam Sengkeo for her own benefit rather than as a bribe for tax officials is (according to the Respondent) manifestly absurd. In this respect, Mr. John Baldwin testified as follows:\n\nQ. Isn't this a statement to the CFO of Sanum/Savan Vegas to pay a bribe of $30,000 to a tax official in the Ministry of Finance?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. How do you interpret it? What does it mean?\n\nA. That the $30,000 success fee was supposed to be paid to Madam Sengkeo and her tax people that were with her.\n\nQ. She is \"the Tax people\"?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Did she work for the government then?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. She didn't? She's not an employee of the Ministry of Finance?\n\nA. No.51\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 66, 1-15.\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the US $30,000 may have gone to Madam Sengkeo in the first instance, but in the Respondent's view, the coincidence of timing with Sanum's apparent need to ingratiate itself with Government officials is fatal to Mr. Baldwin's credibility.\n\n**6.3.1.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimant contends that payment of US $30,000 to Madam Sengkeo was a \"success fee\" for obtaining the FTA where previous intermediaries had failed.52 Mr. Baldwin strongly denied any impropriety:\n\nQ. Down at the bottom of the page it says:\n\n\"Dear Billy and Team, Mr Khamphai of the Tax Department and Mdm Sengkeo had just informed us that Joe had picked up the flat tax document at his office [meaning Mr Khamphai's] since 9AM this morning...\n\nHowever, he has asked us to wire the agreed payment to Madam Sengkeo's account as followed...\"\n\nAnd then they give the account number. So isn't this interesting, that **the day that the flat tax agreement is delivered to your employee, he asked that $30,000 is wired that day** ?\n\nA. Well, my reading of this is that \"he\" is Joe.\n\nQ. And who is he saying that the money should be paid to?\n\nA. Madam Sengkeo.53 (emphasis added)\n\nMr. Baldwin testified in his Second Witness Statement in the SIAC case of 8 June 2015 as follows:  \n15. The Government alleges that I authorized payments totaling US$30,000 to Madame Sengkeo Phimmasone, as a bribe to obtain the flat tax agreement issued on 1 September 2009 for Savan Vegas. This too is false. **The payments represented a success fee to Madam Sengkeo** for her efforts to help Savan Vegas negotiate a Flat Tax Agreement with the Lao Government - a project on which she had worked since at least July 2008.  \n16. Initially, it was the ST Group - then our local partner in Laos - that was responsible for obtaining a flat tax agreement for Savan Vegas. However, it failed to do so, thus by mid-2008, we took it upon ourselves to negotiate such an agreement with the Lao Government. In order to have local Lao expertise to assist us, **Savan Vegas offered a success fee to Madam Sengkeo** to lobby for a satisfactory Flat Tax Agreement for Savan Vegas. Madam Sengkeo was a partner of ST, which is how I came to know her. I discovered that she had many high-level connections in the Lao Government. This made her a natural choice for this consulting engagement. (emphasis added)  \nJohn Baldwin Second Witness Statement, 8 June 2015, paras. 15-16, Exhibit SRE-159.\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 67, 2-18.\n\n121.\n\nMr. John Baldwin testified that there was no reason to bribe any Government employee in September 2009 as the Prime Minister had already agreed to a flat tax agreement in December 2008.54\n\nMr. Baldwin testified:  \nQ. Would there be any reason to have to bribe anyone when the Prime Minister had already approved your flat tax?  \nA. You know, there's no reason to and, plus, obviously, the Prime Minister's office was watching this. The local tax people were watching this, the finance department's watching this. This was a significant project and lots of people were watching it and there's no way. You just wouldn't -couldn't happen.  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 151, 2-11.\n\n**6.3.1.3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent's case is speculative rather than substantial. Madam Sengkeo was in the consulting business. Consultants are paid. While the Claimants never produced a \"consulting agreement\" with Madam Sengkeo, the evidence is that it is not unusual for consultants to insist on a success fee as part of their remuneration. The effort to obtain a FTA was successful. It was likely worth millions of dollars to the Claimants in reduced taxes. In that context, payment of US $30,000 in 2009 is not a disproportionate \"success fee\". Moreover, no one was prosecuted in this affair. Even if Madam Sengkeo did not cooperate with the Government, why was her daughter (the owner of the bank account) not investigated? What is the daughter's explanation? The evidence of corruption in this instance is neither clear nor convincing. The bribery allegation in connection with the FTA is not established to the necessary standard for such a serious charge.\n\n**6.3.2. Second Allegation - Bribes to Extend the Flat Tax Agreement After Expiry of the 5-Year Term**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**6.3.2.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nOn 18 March 2011, Savan Vegas submitted its proposal to extend the FTA, which was due to expire on 31 December 2014. Six days later, on 24 March 2011, the Claimants paid US $21,000 to Mr. Bouker Noutharath, a retired hospital worker from Olympia, Washington State, United States of America, who had returned to live in Laos. He had no experience as a \"consultant\" but had good contacts within the Government. On 4 March 2011, he was retained by Savan Vegas55 as a consultant to lobby in favour of an extension of the FTA. Mr. Baldwin says Mr. Bouker was promised a success fee substantially in excess of US $ 21,000, but Mr. Bouker, who agreed to cooperate with the Government, testified that:\n\nI have seen the entry in the general ledger that I was sent $21,000 on March 24, 2011. The entry says \"prof fee re flat tax acceptance - Brian Nonthavet.\" RE-131. I remember that Sanum was concerned about extending a flat tax agreement, but **I was not involved** in that issue. **I was sent the $21,000 to deliver it to a government person.** I remember it was Mr. Paoa [of Savan Vegas] who asked me to make this payment about the tax issue but **I cannot remember the name of the Government person** who I gave this payment too.56 (emphasis added)\n\n\u2026\n\nThese contracts are for fraud reasons. They were drafted and sent to me by lawyer Martin Gersten.They were to provide a cover for the bribes Sanum intended to pay to have the Government extend the Flat Tax Agreement and to obtain the Thakhaek slot club licence.57\n\nBouker Nonthavet Third Witness Statement, 23 May 2014, Exhibit 4, Respondent's Opening Submission, Slide 161.\n\nBouker Nonthavet First Witness Statement, 2 April 2014, at para. 7.\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 90, 20-25.\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent believes the unidentified \"Government Person\" was Ms. Manivone, but Mr. Baldwin testified he was \"sure\" this was not so:\n\nQ. Do you know that at the time you were negotiating with Madam Manivone in the tax department of the Ministry of Finance?\n\nA. Well, we were - negotiated with Madam Manivone from 2007 clear through, you know, into 2012.\n\n\u2026\n\nQ. Isn't it true that Mr Paoa asked Bouker to deliver $21,000 [in 2012] to Ms Manivone in the tax department to help in negotiations for the flat tax agreement?\n\nA. I don't think so.\n\nQ. But you're not sure?\n\nA. I'm sure....58\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 86, ll. 7-24.\n\n**6.3.2.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nMr. Bouker received a legitimate consulting mandate. By e-mail dated 21 March 2011, he requested US $21,000 as \"an advance\". His bank records do not show a withdrawal of US $21,000 but withdrawals of three different amounts on 28 March (US $9,500 cash), 30 March (US $9,000 to his son) and 4 April (US $2,135 cash). Mr. Bouker is a dissatisfied former employee whose testimony is not credible.\n\n**6.3.2.3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThere are inconsistencies in Mr. Bouker's evidence and it is significant that he can remember nothing about (or is otherwise unwilling to identify) \"the Government Person\" to whom he said he handed US $21,000. There are too many loose ends to his story. There is no evidence that Madam Manivone (the presumed recipient) or anyone else was prosecuted. In the Tribunal's view, the Respondent's evidence does not establish by clear and convincing evidence or on a balance of probabilities that a US $21,000 bribe was offered by Mr. Bouker to any Government official as alleged.\n\n**6.3.3. Third Allegation - The Claimants Paid US $500,000 in Bribes in 2012 to (i) Shut Down the E&Y Audit of Savan Vegas and (ii) to Cause the Government to Shut Down the Thanaleng Slot Club to the Disadvantage of ST Holdings**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nOn 8 July 2012, Mr. Baldwin wired Sanum's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Clay Crawford, that \"Savan has an extraordinary expense of $500,000 this week. I've tell you about it when we speak on the phone, but please think about our cash situation.\"59\n\nE-mail from John Baldwin to Clay Crawford, 8 July 2012, Exhibit SRE-154.\n\n128.\n\nMr. Baldwin accepts that the sum of US $500,000 was subsequently sent to Vientiane including US $300,000 cash in a backpack delivered to Madam Sengkeo by his personal assistant, Bruce Douglas.60\n\nTranscript, 16 June 2015 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, pp. 207-208, Exhibit SRE-160:  \nQ. You ordered Mr. Douglas on that day, or the day before, rather, the same day you had to have the 200,000 on 11 July you ordered Mr. Douglas to get into an airplane in Cambodia, fly across the border with USD 300,000 in a suitcase, didn't you?  \nA. In a backpack.  \nQ. You have USD 500,000 going into Vientiane in a two-day period in cash?  \nA. Yes.\n\n**6.3.3.1. The E&Y Audit**\n--------------------------\n\n129.\n\nMr. Baldwin acknowledges ordering Mr. Douglas to fly to Vientiane with US $300,000 in cash. It is established that US $300,000 was subsequently deposited in Madam Sengkeo's bank account. She subsequently deposited US $30,000 in her bank account in New York.\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent's allegation is that the balance of US $270,000 was paid by Madam Sengkeo to Government officials to stop the E&Y audit of the Savan Vegas which Mr. Baldwin considered part of a Government move to get rid of Sanum and take over the Claimants' gambling assets without compensation.61\n\nMr. John Baldwin testified in his Third Witness Statement, 22 July 2013, at para. 5:  \n...\"Even those few Government officials who will still speak with me have admitted that we have been the target of a deliberate campaign to strip Sanum of its investments in Laos. The objective of these efforts appears to be to leave the successful businesses, in which we invested so much and which we spent years developing, in the hands of our local commercial partner, the ST Group...and the senior Lao Government officials who have intimate business and familial connections with ST.\"\n\n**6.3.3.1.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n----------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the alleged \"loan\" to Madam Sengkeo was undocumented.62 Only US $15,000 has been repaid.63 Mr. Baldwin acknowledges that Madam Sengkeo has not been asked by the Claimants to repay the balance. The US $30,000 deposit in New York was 10% of the US $300,000 transfer. Madam Sengkeo was a \"ten percenter\", and her receipt of US $30,000 indicates that bribes of US $270,000 were paid.\n\nSee testimony of John Baldwin, Transcript, 16 June 2015 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, p. 209, Exhibit SRE-160:  \nJudge Barkett: Can I ask a question? Would there be loan documents evidencing this loan?  \nA. **Not on this loan. We have made her other loans that there are. This was - she was part owner of Paksong Vegas and a part owner of Savan Vegas, small pieces. We had - she helped us with a lot of things,** **but she and I become very close friends****. When she called us, she said she needed it and I responded to that need.** (emphasis added)\n\nTestimony of John Baldwin, Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018 at p. 41, 14-25 to p. 42, 5-10:  \nQ....first of all, your $300,000 loan that you say you gave Madam Sengkeo in 2012, are there any loan documents for that loan?  \nA. No, there are not.  \nQ. Has she ever repaid it?  \nA. She - she paid me 500,000 Thai baht.  \nQ. That's US$15,000?  \nA. US$15,000.  \nQ. Do you have any record of that payment?  \nA. I think so - yeah, I do.  \nQ. Have you ever produced it? You have been asked....  \n\u2026  \nQ. Okay. But the other - let's assume she gave you US$15,000. The other 285,000 that you lent her in 2012 has not been repaid?  \nA. It has not been repaid.  \nQ. And we're now in 2018?  \nA. Yes.\n\n132.\n\nThe bribe succeeded, according to the Respondent. On 12 July 2012, Ernst & Young (\"**E&Y**\") was ordered by unidentified Government officials to stop work on its audit of Savan Vegas.64 The E&Y audit would have disclosed the Claimants' illegal activities (subsequently uncovered by a BDO audit after the Government ousted the Claimants from the casino) including (the Government alleges) embezzlement and money laundering.\n\nLetter from Ernst & Young to the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit SRE-53:  \nIn relation to our final report, we also feel it necessary to remind the Inspection Committee that, since we were instructed by your goodself on 10 July 2012 to cease our fieldwork at Savan Vegas Hotel & Casino (SVC) and to refrain from receiving any additional information and/or documents from SVC on the same day, our final report will only contain our preliminary findings and/or observations for the work performed on documents and information received by us from SVC up till and including 10 July 2012.\n\n**6.3.3.1.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimant says the US $300,000 was a \"loan\" to Madam Sengkeo. The New York deposits are unrelated. Madam Sengkeo was closely involved with ST Holdings. There had been a falling out. She thus had an \"urgency\" for funds when ST Holdings malevolently cut off Madam Sengkeo's regular source of income.65 Mr. Baldwin was a loyal friend.\n\nTranscript, 16 June 2015 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, p. 207-208, Exhibit SRE-160:  \nQ. What was going on in Vientiane in July 2012 that you needed all that cash there except the Thanaleng case was happening about 10 days later and the E&Y audit was terminated the day before. Those are the two events that I can think of that related to Savan Vegas, what can you think of?  \nA. **ST had cut Madame Sengkeo off from any income from their investments, because she had helped us over him, he had cut her off from any money and she lives primarily on money from him. She needed money to pay bills on the hotel she was building. The USD 300,000 is a loan to her.** (emphasis added)\n\n**6.3.3.1.3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nMr. Baldwin's explanation of the US $300,000 payment to Madam Sengkeo is not credible. It is clear on the evidence that Mr. Baldwin and his CFO, Mr. Clay Crawford, were concerned about the threat to Sanum's business posed by the E&Y audit. Mr. Baldwin had every incentive to influence the Government to call off the E&Y audit in the summer of 2012. It is simply not plausible, as the Claimants argue, that the E&Y audit was stopped because Government officials had concluded that E&Y had *failed* to find incriminating evidence. If that were true, the obvious instructions from the Government to E&Y would have been to keep digging, not to give up and down tools.\n\n135.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimants had a powerful motive to stop the audit as Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Crawford knew (and the Government merely suspected) of the existence of financial skeletons in the Savan Vegas books later uncovered by the BDO audit. All in all, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants got a senior Government official to stop the audit and that the $270,000 was paid through Madam Sengkeo (i.e. $300,000 less 10%) to that Government person or persons.\n\n136.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal is troubled by the fact that the Government has apparently not identified any bribe- *takers*. The order to E&Y to stop the audit came as a surprise to E&Y and must have been issued by a senior Government source, otherwise the audit would have continued. The Respondent does not suggest that E&Y took the bribe **but E&Y must know who gave its auditors the order to stop work**. The evidentiary trail could then have been followed up the chain of command from the Government person who gave the order to identify the person who authorized the order, who could then have been required to provide the Government (and subsequently the Tribunal) with an explanation for the stop work order.\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent has not offered any explanation for this gap in the evidence. In the circumstances, while the evidence of Mr. Baldwin that Madam Sengkeo required the funds for her personal use is deeply unsatisfactory, so too is the Government's apparent failure even to *attempt* (so far the evidence is concerned) to get to the bottom of the matter, not only potentially to punish the wrongdoers, but to provide solid evidence that a bribe was given and taken by Government official(s) to stop the E&Y audit.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that it is more probable than not that Madam Sengkeo was used as a conduit to bribe Government officials to stop the E&Y audit, but that this conclusion is not established to the higher standard of \"clear and convincing evidence\". The Tribunal is satisfied, however, on the lesser standard of a balance of probabilities, that Mr. Baldwin involved the Claimants in serious financial illegalities in respect of the halt of the E&Y audit.\n\n**6.3.3.2. Payment of About $200,000 in Bribes to Shut Down the Thanaleng Slot Club**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nIn 2012, the Claimants were experiencing tense relations with their then Laotian partner, ST Holdings. In part, the tensions related to a profitable slot club at Thanaleng, which ST Holdings agreed to joint venture with Sanum. The joint venture was to commence at a future date awaiting the expiry of an earlier arrangement ST Holdings had contracted with a different slot machine supplier. However, when the date for the change-over arrived, ST Holdings refused to proceed with its deal with Sanum.\n\n140.\n\nMr. Baldwin is alleged to have then paid bribes to Government officials through a \"consultant\", Mr. Anousith Thepsimuong, in an effort to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club as a pressure tactic to force ST Holdings to negotiate a solution rather than continue with litigation (which the Claimants ultimately lost in the Laotian Courts).\n\n**6.3.3.2.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n----------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nOn 28 July 2012, during the corporate struggle over the Thanaleng Slot Club, the Claimants attempted to obtain leverage over ST Holdings by bribing Government Ministries to shut down the Club. The money was channelled through Mr. Anousith. The sum of US $190,000 was deposited in Mr. Anousith's bank account on 11 July 2012 and a cash withdrawal of US $100,000 was made the following day.66\n\nExtract of ANZ Bank Statement for Mr. Anousith Thepsimoung, Exhibit SRE-153.\n\n142.\n\nMr. Baldwin testified that Mr. Anousith was paid to lobby \"the National Assembly\" but this explanation is not credible. The National Assembly has no executive function. Only a Government Minister would have operational authority to issue a stop order against the Thanaleng Slot Club.\n\n143.\n\nMr. Baldwin acknowledged that he could not explain how or why the National Assembly would get involved in such an executive action:\n\nQ. You say that the National Assembly is going to suspend a licence, but did he [the Deputy Prime Minister] ever explain or did you ever find out how the National Assembly would actually do that?\n\nA. No.67\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, at p. 9,23-25 to p. 10, 1-4.\n\n**6.3.3.2.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nMr. John Baldwin readily admits that in July 2012 he was doing what was possible to get the Government to close the Thangaleng Slot Club68, including by a written submission to the country's President. The Claimants say there is no reason to disbelieve Mr. Baldwin's evidence that he was told by the Deputy Prime Minister to lobby the country's National Assembly.69\n\nMr. Baldwin testified that he wrote to President Choummaly Sayasone requesting the Government to shut down the Thangaleng Slot Club:  \n\"Sanum asks that the Government suspend that the slot machine licence at the Vientiane Friendship Bridge. We believe that a temporary suspension will encourage the parties to negotiate and come to terms so they can work together. Once the parties have reached an agreement, formed a joint venture that is approved by the relevant ministries, and determine that they can operate the Vientiane.Bridge Slot Club together, the licence would be reinstated. Until then, Sanum requests your assistance in suspending the licence and allowing time and space to work [together] towards peace with [the] ST Group.\" Correct? So, as I said, you were trying to get a space to negotiate your way out of this trouble with ST.  \nA. Yes.  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 7, 19-25 to p. 8, 1-11.\n\nIn re-examination, Mr. Baldwin testified about the National Assembly as follows:  \nMS DEITSCH-PEREZ: You spoke with Mr Branson about the Thanaleng lobbying. Can you tell us where you first got the idea to lobby the assembly with respect to Thanaleng?  \nA. Yeah. I was having breakfast with Deputy Prime Minister Somsavath - we were having oatmeal - and he - I said I got - I have to get - make peace with Sithat somehow and I - how do we do it and he said, you know, it's a tough row, because, you know, she's joined at the hip with Bounnhang -you know, with vice-president Vorachith, Bounnhang Vorachith, and he said I - there's not very many people that are going to be able to help you with this, you've got to make peace with Sithat and Vorachith, so I said, \"Well, who can help me do that?\", and he said, \"Well, two places - the politburo and the National Assembly\", and he said the politburo, \"That's difficult, so I would suggest that you reach out to the National Assembly.\"  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 171, 3-22.\n\n145.\n\nMr. Baldwin denied that money was intended for a Government Minister:\n\nQ. See, that brings us back to July and this $500,000 pot of money that we have sitting in Vientiane in Madam Sengkeo's bank account - her son-in-law's bank account. Isn't it true that that money was there to stop the court case from having a judgment - the money was there so you could get the slot club shut down and negotiate with Mr Sithat?\n\nA. The money was specifically earmarked to do lobbying with the National Assembly.\n\nQ. Well, we just established that y **ou have a good friend who is the fourth most powerful person in the country**. Wasn't the money for him to shut down the club so you could stop the court decision?\n\nA. No.70 (emphasis added)\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 15, 3-18.\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimants argue that there is no evidence that Mr. Anousith paid money to any Government official. He received fees as a consultant to lobby the National Assembly to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club. He was entitled to spend that money as he wished. Laos is a cash economy. Payment of large amounts of cash in respect of legitimate transactions is not unusual.71 Cash does not signal illegality.\n\nTestimony of Mr. John Baldwin, Transcript, 26 January 2017 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, pp. 12667-1268, Exhibit SRE-163:  \n**Q. And then the next day, on July the 12th there was a withdrawal of a hundred thousand, correct, in cash?**  \nA. It shows a withdrawal of a hundred thousand.  \n**Q. What did you tell Mr. Anousith to do with that hundred thousand?**  \nA. I didn't tell him to do anything with that money.  \n**Q. I see. Why did you think he took out a hundred thousand of the 193 you just sent him?**  \nA. We paid him a fee, we didn't - it's his money to do with as he wishes.  \n\u2026  \n**Q. Was his job to get a government minister to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club?**  \nA. No.  \n**Q. What was it to do?**  \nA. We had hired, we had hired him to lobby the national assembly to ask them to shut down the Thanaleng slot club. (emphasis added)\n\n**6.3.3.2.3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nOnce again, the payment to Mr. Anousith is deeply suspicious. There is no documentation of any consultancy. There is no explanation of the work for which almost $200,000 were paid to him and deposited in his personal bank account. The mandate to lobby the \"National Assembly\" seems far-fetched. Moreover, despite the alleged payment of bribes, the Thanaleng Slot Club was not shut down. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to find \"clear and convincing evidence\" that a bribe was made or even offered through Mr. Anousith. However, on the lower \"probabilities\" standard, the Tribunal concludes that it is more likely than not that a bribe was paid to an unidentified Government official or officials in an unsuccessful effort to advance the Claimants' agenda at the Thanaleng Slot Club.\n\n**6.3.4. Fourth Allegation - The Claimants Arranged for a Further $575,000 Bribe to Madam Sengkeo to Prevent Her from Testifying in These Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nIn 2014, when the initial phase of these proceedings was pending, the Government sought to have Madam Sengkeo testify. To that end, she was provided with a written assurance of immunity dated 7 May 2014, if she provided \"information and documents related to offering of bribery to government of [sic] official(s) who were performing accounting audit activities at Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd.\"72\n\nLetter of Immunity from Government's Anti-Corruption Office dated 07/05/2014, Exhibit SRE-140:  \n**LETTER OF ASSURANCE**  \n**Re: Protection of the rights and best interests of individuals who provide information for anticorruption purpose**  \nThe President of the Government Inspection Committee issues a Letter of Assurance for protection to Ms. Sengkeo Phimmasone, aged 60, a business person, residing at Xangkhou Village, Xaythany District, of Vientiance Capital. The assurance of protection is for her contribution in the anticorruption efforts by providing information and documents related to offering of bribery to government of official(s) who were performing accounting audit activities at Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd. In accordance with Article 08, Chapter I of the Law on Anti-Corruption, the Government Inspection Committee issues this Letter, and informs the ministries and organizations, provinces and domestic and foreign organizations to acknowledge based on this Letter of Assurance for Ms. Sengkeo Phimmasone, and this Letter serves as legal evidence.\n\n149.\n\nAt a pre-hearing conference on 14 May 2014, the Claimants (amongst other matters) applied to the Tribunal to allow Mr. Baldwin to make a \"personal loan\" to Madam Sengkeo of US $575,000.73 Given the importance and sensitivity of Madam Sengkeo's evidence potentially to be given at the merits hearing, the Tribunal declined to give its permission for a US $575,000 loan to her from Mr. Baldwin.\n\nSee evidence of Mr. John Baldwin, Transcript, 26 January 2017 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, p. 1391, Exhibit SRE-163, Respondent's Opening Submission, Slide 182.\n\n150.\n\nThe initial hearing on the merits proceeded in Singapore in June 2014. Madam Sengkeo did not attend to testify for the Government.\n\n**6.3.4.1. The Respondent's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nMr. John Baldwin, having been denied the Tribunal's permission, arranged for a third party, Mr. Gary Morris,74 to make Madam Sengkeo a US $575,000 \"loan\" which was undocumented and was not in fact a loan,75 but an inducement to keep Madam Sengkeo from testifying. There is no evidence that the Claimants' loan of US $300,000 in July 2012 or the third party \"loan\" of US $575,000 of May 2014, being a total of US $875,000 has been repaid except for US $15,000, leaving US $860,000 not accounted for.76\n\nTestimony of Mr. John Baldwin, Transcript, 16 June 2015 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, p. 213, Exhibit SRE-163:  \nMr. Branson: Mr. Baldwin, did you ever provide that additional loan guarantee of 575,000 to Ms. Sengkeo?  \n**A. No**.  \nQ. What did you do instead?  \n**A. I asked one of my friends to lend her money on other assets.**  \nQ. Did you guarantee that loan?  \n**A. I did not have to.**  \nQ. Mm?  \n**A. I did not have to.**  \nQ. Why not?  \n**A. The assets that she pledged were of sufficient value that he was content with the loan that was made.**  \nQ. Okay, so you arranged for her to get another loan?  \n**A. Yes.**\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 43, 12-23:  \nQ. When did Madam Sengkeo ask you for the $575,000?  \nA. My recollection is perhaps two weeks before the [ICSID] hearing [in May 2014]. (p. 25, 16-18)  \n\u2026  \nQ. I see. So in May 2014, when your counsel asked this tribunal to allow you to pay her or lend -guarantee, rather, $575,000, what did you do after the tribunal refused to bless that?  \nA. I started asking mutual friends, people that I know, to lend money, if they would lend - make her a loan. (p. 27, 19-25)  \n\u2026  \nQ. And what loan documentation did he get to secure that loan?  \nA. My understanding, and my recollection, is that there are mortgages - there were mortgages given by Madam Sengkeo on significant pieces of real estate that she owned in Vientiane. (p. 28, 8-13)  \n\u2026  \nQ. - to ask Madam Sengkeo?  \nA. No.  \nQ. How about your good friend, Gary Morris, have you asked him to show you any loan documents that he has?  \nA. No.  \nQ. So the two people that, supposedly, are your good friends haven't produced any documents to you to produce to the tribunal?  \nA. No.  \nQ. Has she paid back the 575 to Mr Morris?  \nA. I don't know.\n\nTestimony of Mr. John Baldwin, Transcript, 26 January 2017 Hearing, SIAC Case No. ARB/143/14/MV, p. 1392, Exhibit SRE-163:  \nQ. Has Ms. Sengkeo paid any of that money back?  \nA. I don't know.  \nQ. It means that, as we sit here today, that you lent her 300,000, Mr. Morris, Mr. McCain's colleagues lent her 575, that's $875,000. Has she paid you back?  \nA. She paid me back 500,000 baht.  \nQ. That's 15,000 US?  \nA. Baht money.\n\n**6.3.4.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nMr. Baldwin had a long-standing business relationship with Madam Sengkeo which, over time, developed into personal friendship. It was perfectly normal for Madam Sengkeo to seek a personal loan and for Mr. Baldwin to arrange it. There is no evidence whatsoever that the loan of US $575,000 or any part thereof was intended by Mr. Baldwin, or understood by Madam Sengkeo, as an inducement not to testify. Madam Sengkeo,77 who now lives outside Laos, was being improperly pressured by the Government to give false evidence to support its bribery and corruption case78 and it is therefore quite understandable that she wished to avoid being a witness. Mr. Baldwin's explanation of the loans to Madam Sengkeo is not rebutted and there is no evidence inconsistent with his version of events.\n\nMr. Baldwin testified to his friendship as follows:  \n...but my friendship with Madam Sengkeo is - is - I mean, Madam Sengkeo and I had a great relationship. I mean, it wasn't - she is my friend. I mean, she - we went to many, many, many dinners. I hung out with her family. We - you know, she's my friend. I mean, there was nothing untoward about my business relationships with her.  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 38, 12-20.\n\nMr. John Baldwin testified in re-examination:  \nQ. What else did you hear from Peep about Madam Sengkeo's situation?  \nA. Madam Sengkeo has been under - it's been - what I've been told is that Madam Sengkeo has been under a great deal of pressure by the government of Lao to sign documents making allegations that were not true and she has been very worried about the consequences of this on not only just her economic state, her property holdings and even her personal safety -  \nJUDGE BINNIE: When you say you have been told, who told you?  \nA. Peep. Peep told me, and the - madam - Peep [a Sanum employee] has expressed to me that Madam Sengkeo has expressed to her that she just feels there's an enormous amount of pressure and an enormous amount of personal harm that she is subject to if she doesn't do everything the government asks her to, whether it's true or not. It's there - she says it's been stressed to her it doesn't matter that it's true; she needs to help the government of Lao in their efforts.  \nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 161, 4-25.\n\n**6.3.4.3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe US $575,000 loan, coming on top of the previous loan of US $300,000, of which only US $15,000 were repaid bristles with \"red flags\". Mr. Baldwin clearly intended to sidestep the Tribunal's denial of permission by arranging for the US $575,000 loan from a third party. Given Madam Sengkeo's central role in dealings between the Claimants and the Government over many years, her testimony would have shed crucial light on the legality or illegality of many of the disbursements at issue in the Respondent's allegations.\n\n154.\n\nMr. John Baldwin testified:\n\nQ. So when **Mdm Sengkeo withdrew US$80,000 in cash on July 20**, the day before you went to visit your good friend, the **Deputy Prime Minister**, what do you think she was going to do with those US dollars?\n\nA. It was Mdm Sengkeo's money to do what she wanted. She represented to me that **she needed the loan to pay construction bills**.79 (emphasis added)\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 23, 4-11.\n\n155.\n\nIt cannot be said that the bare payment of US $875,000 to Madam Sengkeo is \"clear and convincing evidence\" of bribery. There is no evidence to contradict Mr. Baldwin's evidence of her need for funds. There are other possible explanations for their disbursement.\n\n156.\n\nOn the whole, however, while the Tribunal is unable to find \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the money was paid to Madam Sengkeo to bribe Government Ministers, the Tribunal is nevertheless satisfied on the lower standard of balance of probabilities that Mr. Baldwin and Madam Sengkeo were involved in channeling funds illicitly to Lao Government officials, and further that she was paid to secure her loyalty and to avoid her testifying on behalf of the Government, thereby obstructing justice.\n\n157.\n\nThe coincidence of the timing of \"loans\" of US $875,000 (less one repayment of US $15,000) to Madam Sengkeo and the Claimants' urgent need for Government intervention on its behalf at critical junctures of its business (the termination of the E&Y audit and the attempt to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club), together with Madam Sengkeo's role as the Claimants' principal go-between with the Government, which Mr. Baldwin describes as a corrupt Government, compels an inference of Mr. Baldwin's unlawful conduct and through Mr. Baldwin, the culpability and bad faith of both LHNV and Sanum, on whose behalf he acted.\n\n158.\n\nThe Government's failure to track down bribe-takers or to provide a convincing explanation of its efforts (even if on occasion unsuccessful) to do so, weighs against the Government's case, although the fact that the key witness, Madam Sengkeo, herself refused to cooperate made the Government's task more difficult.\n\n159.\n\nPossibly the Government prefers to spare itself some embarrassment by declining to put whatever it knows about \"bribe- *takers*\" into the record of the Tribunal.\n\n160.\n\nBe that as it may be, the circumstances disclosed to the Tribunal do not rise to the level of \"clear and compelling evidence\" of corruption.\n\n161.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal's conclusion that corruption of Government officials is established to the lower standard of \"balance of probabilities\" is relevant to the issue of the Claimants' good faith, which is dealt with below.\n\n**6.3.5. Fifth Allegation - Bribery Scheme in June 2015 to Restore Control of Savan Vegas to the Claimants**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondent seized control of the Savan Vegas and gambling facilities on 15 April 2015. Its right to do so was eventually confirmed by an arbitral tribunal constituted under the SIAC by its Award dated 29 June 2017.80\n\nSIAC Award dated 29 June 2017.\n\n163.\n\nPrior to the SIAC Award, however, the Claimants asserted a right under the 2014 Settlement to take back control81 on the basis they had managed to sell their investments on the open market prior to the 15 April 2015 deadline imposed as a term of the Settlement with the Government. The allegedly genuine third-party offer to purchase dated 14 April 2015 was from an entity called **MaxGaming Consulting Services Limited (Macau)** (\"**MaxGaming**\").82 Its CEO, Mr. Angus Noble, represented in writing that MaxGaming had funds available to complete the transaction and intended to do so.83 In testimony before the SIAC tribunal in January 2017, Angus Noble acknowledged that these representations were false.84 He repeated this retraction to this Tribunal at the Hearing. The MaxGaming transaction did not proceed and was found by the SIAC tribunal to be a sham.85 Having heard Mr. Noble's evidence, this Tribunal also concludes that the 14 April 2015 offer was a sham. Indeed Mr. Noble more or less concedes that it was a sham.\n\nEmail from Mr. Gene McCain to Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Shawn Scott dated 15 May 2015, Exhibit SRE-156:  \nThe Buyers have also made it clear that Sanum Investments Ltd. must be given back control of the management of the Casino for the Buyers to regain confidence that the Laos government will honor the Deed of Settlement and so that Sanum can be given time to get the revenue and operations back to where they should be.

The Respondent's Argument**\n--------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe MaxGaming offer was a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by the Claimants in order to regain control of Savan Vegas86 from the Government. The Claimants had every interest in pre-empting the Government's seizure of Savan Vegas and putting a halt to the Government's access to the books of Savan Vegas and records targeted by a Government audit into alleged wrongdoing at Savan Vegas including money laundering and embezzlement.\n\nEmail and clean copies of Gersten's Consulting Agreement, Exhibit SRE-158, Respondent's Opening Submission, Slide 186.

The Claimant'sArgument**\n-----------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nWhile unrealistic, Mr. Noble genuinely believed he could orchestrate the purchase, which he testified was, for him, \"the chance of a lifetime.\"\n\n**6.3.5.3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe MaxGaming offer was indeed a sham, but bribery and corruption, as opposed to fraud and chicanery, is not established.\n\n**6.3.6. Sixth Allegation - Miscellaneous Acts of Bribery and Corruption**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nOther allegations of bribery and corruption were made:\n\n(a) offer of a US $7 million bribe to the Prime Minister of Laos for approval of a licence to establish a casino in the capital city of Vientiane;87\n\n(b) a bribe of US $80,000 to the Governor of the Province of Champasak to approve a slot club at Chong Mek;88 and\n\n(c) bribes totalling US $106,000 to Government officials to enable the opening and continued operation of the Paksan Slot Club.89\n\nThere is no \"clear and convincing\" evidence against the Claimants in support of any of these additional claims of bribery and corruption.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, para. 97.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 100-101; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 21-22.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, paras. 102-104.\n\n168.\n\nAs the Claimants point out, the Respondent has identified only two possible Government bribe takers, namely Mr. Bounnong (but there is no indication he has been investigated) and Madam Manivone. The evidence is that Madam Manivone was put under investigation only after refusing to testify for the Respondent.90 The Claimants state that on 29 May 2014, the Respondent promised its Rejoinder would reveal the results of its investigation. It did not.\n\nSee the Respondent's email to the Tribunal dated 29 May 2014, Claimants' Closing Submission, Slide 12.\n\n169.\n\nThe Claimants complain, rightly, that the Respondent's failure to offer any credible explanation for not pursuing the investigation of its own employees, or indeed even to attempt to identify the alleged bribe-takers, weighs against the credibility of these miscellaneous allegations.91\n\nThe Claimants cite *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, 8 December 2000, CLA(LH)-070, which rejected the Government's bribery defence in part for failure to show the implicated Government official was investigated and prosecuted:  \n116. Although the Tribunal believes Minister Sultan's testimony that he was not personally aware that \"Mr. Kandil was an agent to Farargy\" and that when he did learn about it, \"I passed that to the prosecutor requesting a full-fledged investigation\", it is undisputed that Mr. Kandil was never prosecuted in Egypt in connection with this agreement. Regrettably, because Egypt has failed to present the Tribunal with any information about the investigation requested by Minister Sultan, the Tribunal does not know whether an investigation was conducted and, if so, whether the investigation was closed because the prosecutor determined that Mr. Kandil was innocent, because of lack of evidence, or because of complicity by other government officials. Nevertheless, given the fact that the Egyptian government was made aware of this agreement by Minister Sultan but decided (for whatever reasons) not to prosecute Mr. Kandil, the Tribunal is reluctant to immunize Egypt from liability in this arbitration because it now alleges that the agreement with Mr. Kandil was illegal under Egyptian law.\n\n170.\n\nNevertheless, in the Tribunal's view, none of these additional allegations is supported by sufficient evidence to warrant further inquiry or comment.\n\n**6.4. The Claimant's Lack of Good Faith**\n------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nMuch of the Claimant's case rests on the allegation that it proceeded in all respects in good faith but was thwarted at every turn by a corrupt and devious Government acting in bad faith. On the contrary, the evidence is clear that the Claimants dealt in bad faith with the Government from the initial signing of the Paksong Hotel and Casino PDA calling for a US $25 million hotel and casino to the financial irregularities in the operation of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. The Claimants never intended to build a US $25 million facility in Paksong. From the Claimants' perspective, the benefit of the Paksong PDA was a monopoly to block other more serious investors from offering gambling facilities in Champaska and Salavan Provinces. Having obtained the monopoly, the Claimants attempted to force the Government's hand in relocating the project to what, from the Government's perspective, was a much less attractive site. The bad faith continued through the disputes over the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, which was built but operated in defiance of Sanum's reporting obligations to the Government (and, when the books were eventually opened, revealed significant financial irregularities). The bad faith continued further up to its recent efforts to deter Madam Sengkeo's appearance to testify at the merits proceeding and the sham MaxGaming offer to purchase Savan Vegas in April of 2015.\n\n172.\n\nThe principle of good faith arises in investment treaty arbitrations in various contexts. Tribunals, of course, regularly refer to Article 31(1) of the VCLT for the rule that treaties shall be interpreted in good faith. The obligation extends to a duty of parties to arbitrate in good faith.92 In *Phoenix v. Czech Republic*, the tribunal referred to Phoenix's \"initiation and pursuit of this arbitration\" as \"an abuse of the system of international ICSID investment arbitration.\"93 (The tribunal found an abuse of rights in that case by the \"claimant's creation of a legal fiction in order to gain access to an international arbitration procedure to which it was not entitled.\"94)\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Final Award, Exhibit CLA-168, where good faith was discussed in the context of the alleged interception and surveillance by Turkish police of legally privileged communications between the claimant, its counsel and witnesses. See also Born, *International Commercial Arbitration* at pp. 1008-1014 and *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL (1976), Final Award, Exhibit CLA-259.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, at para. 144, Exhibit RA-25.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 143.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal listened carefully to the testimony of Mr. John Baldwin and found him to be an argumentative witness who preferred evasion to candour. Much of his testimony was simply not credible. He proceeded in bad faith from the outset in assuring the Government that he intended to invest US $25 million at the Paksong site, which by his own account was likely to be highly unprofitable.\n\n174.\n\nMr. Baldwin is the directing mind of both Claimant companies. His conduct throughout was to advance their corporate interests. His bad faith conduct is their conduct. While the Government's conduct was at times aggressive and inappropriate in relation to the Settlement (as documented, for example, in the Second Material Breach Application), nevertheless the Claimant failed to establish that the Government acted in bad faith in relation to the investors or the investments.\n\n175.\n\nIt is well established that the bad faith conduct of the investor is relevant to the grant of relief under an investment treaty.95\n\nSee UNCTAD Series on International Agreements III, *Fair and Equitable Treatment* (2012) at pp. 83-85: Investor conduct has emerged as a relevant factor in the analysis of FET claims by arbitral tribunals. It may be relevant in two ways. First, **it may justify the measure taken against the investor by the respondent country**. Thus in *Genin v. Estonia*, the tribunal found that the Estonian national bank had good reasons to revoke the operating license of the claimant's investment because the claimant had failed to disclose relevant facts. In such cases, the adverse measure serves as a State's reaction to, or a sanction for the investor's conduct... **Fraud or misrepresentation on the part of an investor may form the basis of a legitimate regulatory interference with its rights. In such cases, even the outright termination of the investment may be justified, provided it is a proportionate response to the investor's conduct in light of the relevant domestic laws of the host State**...in some situations, an investor's own conduct may be held to be a cause for the harm suffered.\n\n176.\n\nTo summarize, the particular acts of bad faith by Mr. Baldwin on behalf of the Claimant of most concern to the Tribunal are:\n\n(a) misrepresentations made to the Government to obtain Paksong Hotel and Casino PDA on the strength of a promise to make a US $25 million investment on the site which, in the Tribunal's view, the Claimants never intended to pursue;\n\n(b) likely making illegal payments to Government officials to stop the E&Y audit of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino;\n\n(c) likely attempting to obstruct justice with the payment of US $875,000 to Madam Sengkeo directed, as to US $575,000, to the obstruction of the due process of this arbitration by paying Madam Sengkeo not to testify;\n\n(d) attempting to mislead the Treaty Tribunals with the sham offer to purchase the Savan Vegas from MaxGaming Consulting.96\n\nAlthough the MaxGaming incident occurred after the date of Settlement, it was fully debated at the Hearing and formed part of the corpus of the bad faith allegations.\n\n177.\n\nAs will be seen, the Claimant's claims for expropriation fail on the facts. However, having listened to Mr. Baldwin's explanations over several hearings of his dealings with Laos, the Tribunal wishes to leave in no doubt its conclusion that Mr. Baldwin and Sanum exhibited manifest bad faith in various efforts not only to manipulate the Government to advance their gambling initiatives but, in the instance of Madam Sengkeo, to manipulate the arbitration process itself.\n\n**7. THE CLAIM FOR EXPROPRIATION**\n----------------------------------\n\n**7.1. Thanaleng Slot Club**\n----------------------------\n\n**7.1.1. Background**\n---------------------\n\n178.\n\nAt its origin, the dispute underlying the Thanaleng claim is a contractual dispute between two private parties, Sanum and ST. They had signed a **Master Agreement** on 30 May 2007, where they agreed \"to negotiate and work towards entering into certain joint ventures, represented by necessary agreements, which shall convey 60% of all 2nd Party's [ST] gaming businesses located in the country of Lao PDR... This Agreement is not intended to be a definitive agreement but only provides the Parties' general understandings of their relationship. The Parties agree to work together in good faith to negotiate and finalize all necessary agreement to fully implement the concept and terms set forth in this Agreement.\"97 The Respondent's treatment of the Thanaleng situation is part of the \"totality of the facts\" said by counsel for the Claimants to be relevant to Sanum's Treaty claims.98\n\nMaster Agreement, Exhibit C(B)-1.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n179.\n\nOn 4 October 2008, Sanum and ST signed a Participation Agreement for Thanaleng (\"**Participation Agreement**\"). Under this agreement, Sanum agreed to supply to ST certain slot machines, on a \"generated revenue sharing/participation basis.\"99 This agreement was meant to expire on 11 October 2011 when an existing contract of ST with another supplier of slot machines expired. As explained by Sanum, \"the expiration of the Participation [Agreement] is only the end of percentage of profit distribution and proportion of shareholding of each party in the business participation of the Slot Club, which shifted from ST Group who used to receive 60% to receive 40% instead, and Sanum who used to receive 40% to receive 60%, and at the same time (after 11 October 2011) there shall change or create a joint venture company of which Sanum holds 60% and ST Group 40%.\"100\n\nParticipation Agreement, Exhibit C(B)-6.\n\nSee Sanum's Defense and Counterclaim in the proceedings before the Lao Commercial Court dated 3 July 2012, Exhibit C(B)-181.\n\n180.\n\nThe controversy arose because Sanum and ST disagreed on whether the Master Agreement remained in force and was valid and created binding obligations on the parties, despite the expiration of the Participation Agreement. Was the Participation Agreement a temporary agreement just to cover the period of time when other slot machine supplier contracts were in place? Once those machine supplier contract expired on 11 October 2011, did the Master Agreement and other agreements referenced above remain in effect and control the contractual relationship between Sanum and the ST Group?101\n\n*Ibid*. The term \"supplier contract\" is used in singular or plural indistinctly in the original text.\n\n**7.1.2. The Claimants' Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they were deprived of their investment by flawed court proceedings tainted by interference by the Respondent and without payment of compensation. The Claimants summarize the measures for which they seek relief as follows: \"Beginning with premature termination of the OEDR proceedings on orders from the Minister of Justice, and police participation in Sanum's eviction from the Thanaleng Club, and ending with manifestly unreasonable judgments rendered by the courts of Laos, Respondent directed a result in favor of ST that deprived Sanum of its entitlement to 60% of the revenues generated by its investment in the Thanaleng Slot Club. The entire process was marred by manifest procedural defects, as well as producing a result that was substantially unreasonable.\"102\n\nClaimants' Closing Submission, Slide 25; Amended Transcript, 7 September 2018, p. 23, 21-25 to p. 25, 8-21.\n\n182.\n\nAt the closing of the Hearing, the Claimants confirmed that their Thanaleng claim in this proceeding is not based on denial of justice but on the allegation that the totality of the Respondent's treatment substantially deprived the Claimants of the enjoyment of their investment without the payment of compensation.103\n\nClaimants' Closing Submission, Slide 68.\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimants insist that Sanum did have an ownership interest in Thanaleng as established in the Master Agreement, and invested millions of dollars in Thanaleng. The Claimants argue that the Respondent's interpretation of the Master Agreement is contrary to the understanding and conduct of the parties to this agreement; it was a binding agreement that contemplated future negotiations between Sanum and a would-be supplier of slot machines and not between Sanum and ST. The fact that the Master Agreement contemplated additional agreements does not detract from its binding character. The Claimants point out that when ST sought the judicial annulment of the Master Agreement, the document was described as the \"basic agreement defining rights in order to manage the relations between both parties.\"104\n\nClaimant's Reply, para. 37.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants dispute the relevance of the cases relied on by the Respondent because in the instant case the Respondent consistently treated the Master Agreement as legally binding, \"[o]nly Laos - for the first time in these proceedings - has ever characterized the Master Agreement as an agreement to agree that did not generate legally enforceable rights.\"105\n\n*Ibid*., para. 39.\n\n185.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, ST refused repeatedly to accept payment in exchange for a contractually-required exchange of rights which did not extinguish the rights of Sanum, \"but merely constituted another breach by ST of its obligations to relinquish control of the club to Sanum.\"106\n\n*Ibid*., para. 48.\n\n**7.1.3. The Respondent's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the decision of the Lao Courts concerns a private dispute between ST and Sanum and there was nothing untoward in the various judicial proceedings in Laos. According to the Respondent, the Claimant has committed abuse of process by pursuing contradictory claims in parallel arbitrations against Laos based on the same treaties and the same economic interests. In this respect the Respondent, at the Hearing, recounted the timeline of the procedure:\n\nWe have in July 2012 the decision of the Lao Commercial Court. Immediately, before they exhausted their local remedies, which they are required to do under international law, they filed this arbitration alleging that the Thanaleng court decision was a denial of justice and an expropriation. Later they amended to say it's an expropriation.\n\nIn June 2015, there was a decision by the LHNV tribunal on the first material, the breach application. They didn't prevail.\n\nThree months later, they filed the SIAC arbitration against ST on the same contracts, alleging that the Lao court proceedings had no meaning, they were just -- how would one say it?\n\nOne would say their view of the Lao court proceedings in Singapore was that they were a voluntary mediation. If you don't like the result of a mediation, you withdraw and you go to court. That's how they're treating the Lao court proceeding when they go to Singapore: it didn't matter, is it wasn't definitive.\n\nSo, they get an ST SIAC Award in August 2016. They filed it in the Lao courts in 2017.\n\nThen the Lao courts refused to enforce it in August 2017. On 1 September 2017, they filed a denial of justice claim in the new ICSID arbitration. Then in December 2017, the second material breach application was granted, reinstating this tribunal to hear the Thanaleng case again.\n\nSo they have these conflicting - once you issued the second material breach decision, it revived these two treaty claims that are in conflict with the treaty claims they had filed in September 2017.107\n\nAmended Transcript, 3 September 2018, p. 143, 6-25 to p. 144, 1-17.\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent further explained:\n\nSanum said in these cases that the 26 July 2012 decision of the court was expropriation number one. They said their rights were expropriated, that's the claim here, and they filed the first BIT claims in August 2012.\n\nBut the second BIT arbitration says that the date of expropriation was August 2017 when the Lao courts refused to enforce the SIAC award, and that's the subject of the second BIT arbitration.\n\nSo you have these inconsistent claims made by the same claimant under the same treaties, based on the same facts. We say that's an abuse of process.108\n\n*Ibid*., p. 145, 5-19.\n\n**7.1.4. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Thanaleng claim relates to a dispute between the Claimants and ST. It concerns the Respondent only to the extent of the Respondent's alleged interference in court proceedings, and only if its actions could be characterized as a violation of international law.\n\n189.\n\nThe Claimants have placed the weight of their argument on the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao Commercial Court proceedings in 2012. But the dispute resolution provision in the Master Agreement (Article 2.10)109 provides for a four-stage mechanism. At the fourth stage, after a party to the Master Agreement has exhausted the remedies available in the Lao Courts, it may submit the dispute to arbitration if it is unsatisfied with the result without the need to demonstrate a breach of due process or other violations in the conduct of the court proceedings.\n\n\"If any dispute shall arise, the Parties agree to conduct an amicable negotiation. If such dispute cannot be settled by mediation, the Parties may submit such disputes to the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization or Courts of the Lao PDR according to the provision and law of Lao PDR in accordance with this Agreement. All proceedings of the arbitration shall be conducted in Lao and English languages.  \nBefore settlement by the arbitrator under the Rules of the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization, the Parties shall use all efforts to assist the dispute resolution in accordance with the laws of Lao PDR.  \nIf one of the Parties is unsatisfied with the results of the above procedure, the Parties shall mediate and, if necessary, arbitrate such dispute using internationally recognized mediation/arbitration company in Macao, SAR PRC.\" Master Agreement, C(B)-001.\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimants also explained that the four-step mechanism provided for in the Master Agreement has been found to violate Lao law and, therefore, \"any award rendered under the mechanism that differed from the judgment of the Lao Courts would [not] be enforceable in Laos (the only country where the ST's assets are now located) as a matter of Lao public policy.'\"110\n\nClaimant's Closing Submission, Slide 69.\n\n191.\n\nSanum has exercised in full the four levels of remedies provided for in the Master Agreement. After exhausting its recourse to the Lao Courts, Sanum initiated the SIAC arbitration in 2015. In 2016, the SIAC tribunal awarded Sanum the $200 million it had claimed.\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimants say that they have not been able to enforce the SIAC award and link the inability to enforce it to the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao Commercial Court in 2012. As explained by the Claimants at the Hearing:\n\nThe problem is, looking at the totality of the circumstances, the Lao Court of Appeals - and that's the highest level in an enforcement proceeding - won't allow enforcement of the SIAC award and so the original action that the government took in ramming the original decision through to benefit ST and forcing claimants to have to go to that additional stage, to have to go to the fourth stage, that allowed ST the time to move all of its assets back into Laos and put the claimants in a position where they would be dependent on going to Laos to enforce the award against ST where the same thing, or worse, could happen. So, there was a distinct consequence at the stage of the measure relating to the Thanaleng proceeding in 2012.\n\nEven if the claimant could then go on to the SIAC proceeding, which it did, there was still a consequence and there was still harm caused by that action, because being able to go to the fourth tier, that didn't right the ship. That didn't enable Sanum to have a clear path to recovery. So there's still consequences to what the government did in 2012.\"111\n\nAmended Transcript, 7 September 2018, p. 40, 19-25 to p.41, 1-17.\n\n193.\n\nThe Claimants want to skip over the fact that Sanum has a valid arbitral award against a private party in which it was awarded 200 million dollars after it exhausted the remedies in the Lao Courts for the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao Commercial Court back in 2012. The alleged inability to enforce the award is not before this Tribunal and it has not been proven by the Claimants that \"there was a distinct consequence [of the Government's alleged interference] at the stage of the measure relating to the Thanaleng proceeding in 2012.\"112 There is simply no persuasive evidence that the alleged interference of the Respondent in the proceeding of a lower court interfered with the steps taken by the Claimants to exercise their rights under the Master Agreement and, in particular, their recourse to SIAC arbitration.\n\nAmended Transcript, 7 September 2018, p. 41, 7-9.\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimants say their claim in the SIAC arbitration was not for the full amount of the value lost in Thanaleng. The Claimants explained why Sanum capped its claim for damages:\n\nin part because ST did not appear and that raised the issue of whether or not they were going to hide assets, such that it was fruitless to seek the full value of Thanaleng. The full value of Thanaleng, I know we're bifurcated so we're not going to talk very much about those kind of things, but the full value of Thanaleng is more than 400 million in order to not have the fees, and in light of the practical recognition that ST was likely hiding its assets, we capped the SIAC claim at 200 million. So it won't be possible to recover the full amount from ST to cover the cost of the damage that the government caused by directing the Thanaleng case in Laos.113\n\nAmended Transcript, 3 September 2018, p. 125, 3-16.\n\n195.\n\nThe Respondent is not responsible for the decision of the Claimants to self-limit the amount of the claim against ST. The evidence does not establish any improper interference by the Respondent in the court proceedings.\n\n196.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal concludes that the claim for expropriation in respect of the Thanaleng investment lacks any merit.\n\n**7.2. Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**7.2.1. Background**\n---------------------\n\n197.\n\nOn 10 August 2007, a Project Development Agreement was concluded between Lao PDR, and Sanum, the Laotian company Nouansavanh Construction Co. Ltd., and Mr. Sittixay Xaysana for the development of the Paksong casino (\"**Paksong PDA**\"). Under the Paksong PDA, a Laotian entity, Paksong Vegas and Casino Co. Ltd., was set up with Lao PDR holding 20%, Sanum 60% and the ST entities 20%. The Paksong PDA required the Company to build and operate a $25 million hotel casino and golf resort in the Paksong district of Champasak Province.\n\n**7.2.2. Location of Paksong**\n------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nAs explained by the Claimants, the location was challenging:\n\n\"The challenges were both logistical and commercial. Logistically, Paksong's location meant that transportation of construction materials would be more costly than at the Savan Vegas site, as access to the site was more difficult and time consuming, and that other construction costs would be significantly higher than those of Savan Vegas. Also, the concession was located on the side of a large hill which precluded the building of simple, large buildings to house the hotel and casino and other amenities. Commercially, since Paksong was not located on the border with Thailand or even in a population center in Laos that was easy to access, it lacked a readily identifiable customer base. The challenges of attracting customers made it difficult to identify the optimal type of facility to construct on the site.\"114\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 63.\n\n199.\n\nMr. Baldwin testified about the problem posed by Paksong's distance from the Thai border:\n\nAnother challenge posed by Paksong Vegas had to do with its customer base. Because Lao citizens generally are restricted from playing table games, the customer base for our casinos consists largely of Thai citizens who live in Northeastern Thailand. However, because Paksong Vegas would be located deep in Laos's interior, without easy access to the border, we were concerned that it would be difficult to attract customers to the casino.115\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. John Baldwin, 1 October 2013, para. 32.\n\n200.\n\nThese challenges notwithstanding, Mr. John Baldwin testified that the Paksong project package \"came with very valuable benefits. Chief among these were the monopoly gaming rights in Champasak and Salavan Provinces granted to Paksong Vegas under the PDA.\"116\n\n*Ibid*., para. 64.\n\n201.\n\nDue to the challenges posed by the site, on 31 March 2008, Paksong Vegas proposed to the provincial government, *inter alia*, to move the entire project to the area near Chong Mek. On 29 April 2008, the proposal was rejected by the provincial government.\n\n202.\n\nOn 21 August 2008, the office of the Prime Minister advised that Paksong Vegas was to return Paksong and pursue only the project at Khone Phapheng (where the Government also favoured development) together with other interested parties. The notice from the Champasak Provincial Office requested Sanum \"to follow the agreements already reached by higher authority and only do the work at Kilometer 30 in Paksong. (According to instructions from the Government Secretariat, if the company cannot comply, then the project must be placed on hold for now).\"117 The notice added that \"[i]t is not approved to open casino branches in Paksong and other places, only at Khone Phapheng. The Paksong land (Kilometer 30) will be returned to the Government.\"118\n\nNotice from Champasak Provincial Office conveying denial of the proposed relocation of \"higher authority\". Exhibit C(S)-309.\n\nExhibit C(S)-311.\n\n203.\n\nOn 23 October 2008, the Prime Minister's Office issued a notice, purporting to strip Paksong Vegas of its monopoly rights. The Prime Minister's Office also reiterated that Yingsoksay, the operator of the existing hotel and resort in the area, could look for other foreign investors to develop Khone Phapheng; Paksong Vegas could participate in that development if it chose to do so, but either way, according to the Prime Minister's Office, it no longer had the exclusive right to do so. Further, on 19 December 2008, Champasak provincial authorities instructed Paksong Vegas to return the land concession it had been granted so it could be used for \"another purpose,\" referencing the Prime Minister's 21 August 2008 notice.119\n\n*Ibid*., para. 76.\n\n204.\n\nOn 30 January 2009, a meeting was held in the MPI's offices. It was attended by all Lao agencies concerned and Paksong Vegas. The Paksong Vegas and Casino Development Project and the Khone Phapheng Entertainment Complex Project Development were discussed. The Tribunal will re-visit this meeting in its analysis.\n\n205.\n\nOn 27 April 2010, the MPI terminated the PDA because Paksong Vegas had not signed a land concession agreement in accordance with Article 4 of the PDA, and construction on the project had been delayed for more than two years, which affected the \"social-economic development plan of Champasak province.\"120 Termination of the PDA was re-affirmed by the Respondent on 10 April 2012.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 82.\n\n**7.2.3. The Claimant's Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe dispute concerns the termination of the Paksong PDA and the revocation of the concomitant land concession. For the Claimant, the actions of the Respondent constitute an expropriation under Article 4 of the BIT. The Claimant argues that the Respondent ignores the evidence that Lao authorities had ordered Sanum to cease construction and two years later without prior notice cancelled the PDA on grounds of failing to develop the land.\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimant questions the Respondent's defence to the expropriation claim. First, there is no contemporaneous evidence that Sanum repudiated the PDA when it proposed to relocate. Second, the Respondent ignores the work done by Sanum.121 Third, the contention that Sanum lacked necessary funds has never been raised before, and the Respondent has not followed the PDA's procedures to establish \"financial inability\". Fourth, cancellation to avoid the Claimant's monopoly rights does not absolve the Respondent from the claim of expropriation.\n\nSee slide 20 of Claimant's Opening Argument.\n\n**7.2.4. The Respondent's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThe Respondent claims that Sanum was not a ready, willing and able investor for the Paksong project. According to the Respondent, Sanum forfeited the concession because the location was not commercially acceptable. The Respondent explains that Paksong and Savannakhet were linked; they were part of a bargain: whoever would develop Savannakhet, an excellent commercial site, must also develop the less attractive Paksong. According to the Respondent, Paksong is in the Champasak province and, in addition to Paksong, two other locations in that province are mentioned in the record: Chong Mek and Khonephapheng. The Respondent contends that Sanum was only interested in Chong Mek, but not in either of the other sites. The provincial government was keen to develop the remote areas while Sanum was interested in more profitable sites; the interests of Sanum as a commercial developer and of the provincial government were not aligned.\n\n209.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it is impossible to read into the Paksong PDA the right claimed by Sanum to build other casinos or slot clubs. The PDA gives Sanum the exclusive right to operate in the provinces covered by the PDA, which simply means \"no one else would be allowed to build a casino or slot club in those provinces.\"122 The Respondent affirms that there has never been an additional casino or slot club. There has not been expropriation of \"monopoly rights\".123 According to the Respondent, Mr. Baldwin's assertion that Sanum could not build at Paksong because the Government \"would no longer respect its monopoly rights\" is frivolous. Mr. Baldwin refused to develop Paksong because he did not want to lose money on a project doomed to commercial failure.\"124\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 91.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 91.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 97.\n\n**7.2.5. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe issues to be addressed by the Tribunal may be formulated as follows: Was the act of termination of the PDA an expropriatory measure or the exercise by the Respondent of its right to terminate the PDA for failure of Paksong Vegas to meet its obligations? In addition, what weight should be given to the allegation that the procedure for termination provided for in Article 19 of the PDA was not followed?\n\n211.\n\nFirst of all, what were the rights of Sanum in Paksong Vegas? In its Reply, the Claimant notes that \"Laos does not dispute that Claimant possessed property rights through Paksong Vegas that could be subject to expropriation, most notably, the valuable monopoly rights in Champasak Province acquired pursuant to the Paksong Vegas PDA.\"125 The Respondent did not question this understanding of the Claimant in the Rejoinder or the Opening Statement at the Hearing. However, at the closing, the Respondent argued that the Claimant had no cognizable property right based on the definition of the term \"Land Map\" in the PDA.126 This definition explains that the seal of the Government Agency affixed to the land lease demonstrates \"conclusively that the right to lease that piece of land belongs to the company.\"127 But the company as defined in the PDA means the parties to the Paksong PDA, one of which is the Claimant.\n\nReply, para. 133.\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, slide 30.\n\nUnderlined in red in the original. PDA, SRE-4, para. 9.\n\n212.\n\nSecond, what is the extent of Paksong Vegas's monopoly rights in Champasak province? As confirmed by Mr. Baldwin's testimony at the Hearing, Mr. Baldwin wanted to develop a site at Chong Mek. He agreed that the monopoly rights were limited to the Paksong development area and did not include Chong Mek, \"unless the government agreed to modify this. The way it's written right now, it does not include Chong Mek but it doesn't say we can't ask for modifications.\"128 Mr. Baldwin also confirmed that he really knew that the Government policy was not to approve a move to Chong Mek.\n\nAmended Transcript, 4 September 2018, p. 216, 19-22.\n\n213.\n\nThird, did Paksong Vegas forfeit its rights when the Claimant informed the Lao Government that it did not wish to pursue the project at Paksong? The Claimant has explained that the proposal of 31 March 2008 remained subject to Government approval. On 29 April 2018, the Government rejected the proposal and instructed Sanum to \"follow the agreements already reached by higher authority and only do the work at Kilometer 30 in Paksong. (According to instructions from the Government Secretariat, if the company cannot comply then the project must be placed on hold for now).\"129\n\nExhibit C(S)-309, Notice from Champasak Provincial Office to Champasak Division for Planning and Investment, dated 29 April 2008.\n\n214.\n\nThe terms of the notice rejecting the proposal affirm that at the time, the Government's intention was not to terminate the PDA, but to request that the existing agreements be respected, and only if the company could not comply, to stop the project for the time being. The Respondent has argued the Claimant's forfeiture of the rights of Paksong Vegas in this proceeding in 2014, six years later. If this would have been the case, it would not have been necessary for the Government to terminate the PDA in 2010.\n\n215.\n\nWas the Respondent entitled to terminate the PDA in 2010? Sanum has argued that it had been asked to stop work at Paksong and that was the only reason why the work was behind. However, the minutes of the meeting held on 30 January 2009 show that the meeting chair \"cited many deficiencies of the company [Paksong Vegas] in its performance of the contract.\"130 More significantly, among the unanimous resolutions reached at this meeting, Paksong Vegas accepted that \"in the past it has not carried out the Paksong Vegas project as scheduled in the contract and as it was presented to the Province.\"131 According to the minutes: \"The meeting agreed to have Paksong Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd. to follow instructions in Lao Government Notice No. 1469/GS, dated 21 August 2008 and Notice No. 1887/GS, dated 23 October 2008. The main points of discussion were: not to approve opening branches of the Casino in Paksong and other areas, but to allow casino operations only in Khone Phapheng Development Project. The land in Paksong Development Project (KM30) is to be returned to the Government. No exclusive rights are to be granted, and the agreement with Paksong Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd is to be revised.\"132\n\nExhibit C(S)-320. Minutes dated 6 February 2009.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Claimant admitted, at the meeting of 30 January 2009, that \"it has not carried out the Paksong Vegas project as scheduled in the contract and as it was presented to the Province.\" Mr. Baldwin also testified at the Hearing that no contract to build a $25 million five-star hotel with a casino and nightclub was ever signed.133\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 63, 4-7.\n\n217.\n\nWhat is the significance of the lack of notice by the Respondent to Paksong Vegas under Article 19 of the PDA? According to Article 19, notice was required indicating the non-performance and giving 90 days to correct it. It is undisputed that the Respondent did not give notice to Paksong Vegas of non-performance of the obligations under the PDA. But Paksong Vegas had not made the investment it had promised in the PDA within the expected timeframe as admitted by Paksong Vegas. It had also agreed at the meeting of January 30, 2009 to operate a casino in Khone Phapheng, and \"[a]s for the Paksong project, the company is happy to follow the government's guidance.\"134 As recorded in the same meeting, the Government's guidance was to return the land to the Government.135 In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds there was no need for Paksong Vegas to be further notified. The Respondent had been clear in that the PDA would need to be revised and Sanum had agreed to revise it. The Claimant had not complied with the terms of the PDA and could not reasonably keep its monopoly rights indefinitely while at the same time maintaining that the development of Paksong was a losing proposition not worth a US $25 million investment. **Mr. Baldwin confirmed at the Hearing that no contract to build a $25 million five-star hotel with a casino and nightclub was ever signed.136**\n\nMinutes dated 6 February 2009, p. 2, C(S)-320.\n\nMinutes dated 6 February 2009, p. 2, C(S)-320; Notice from the Prime Minister's Office to the Minister of the MPI, 21 August 2008, C(S)-311; Notice from the Prime Minister's Office to the MPI et al., 23 October 2008, C(B)-497.\n\nAmended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p.63, 4-7.\n\n218.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant lost its rights under the PDA because it breached its terms and, by its own admission, the Paksong site could not be developed. This Claimant's admission contradicts its argument that work was being done and, if not done, was due to the Government order to stop the work. The loss of Paksong was not an expropriation, it was termination for breach of contract. The monopoly rights cherished by Sanum had a concomitant obligation to invest, which Sanum admits it did not fulfil.\n\n**7.3. Paksan Slot Club**\n-------------------------\n\n**7.3.1. Background**\n---------------------\n\n219.\n\nAs told by Sanum and not disputed by the Respondent, the relevant facts are that \"[s]oon after Sanum agreed to partner with ST, it discovered that there was an existing slot club in operation in the Paksan district of Bolikhamxay Province - one of the provinces in which Savan Vegas has the exclusive right to operate. To enforce that exclusive right, ST asked the Government of Bolikhamxay Province to shut down the club, and it did so.\"137 The existence of the slot club led Savan Vegas to open its own club at the same location, the Paksan Hotel.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 89.\n\n220.\n\nThe **Ministry of Information and Culture** (\"**MIC**\") granted Savan Vegas a one-year license to operate a slot club in the Bolikhamxay Province on 24 October 2007. The MIC renewed the license on 26 November 2008.\n\n221.\n\nAfter the lease of the former club expired in October 2008, Savan Vegas signed its own lease on 25 December 2008 and refurbished the space in the Paksan Hotel formerly occupied by the slot club. The club re-opened on 25 October 2009 and the MIC renewed the slot license for another year on 27 October 2009.\n\n222.\n\nOn 18 February 2010, the Prime Minister's Office ordered the slot club license to be cancelled: \"The authorization to open an electronic gaming club granted to Savan Vegas Ltd. by the Information and Culture Department of Bolikhamxay Province is not in accordance with regulations in that it exceeds the authority of that office. Therefore, you should stop operation of electronic gaming at Paksan Hotel. Further, the company is no longer authorized to erect an advertising billboard in Bolikhamxay Province.\"138\n\nExhibit C(S)-326, p. 3.\n\n223.\n\nThe license was not renewed in 2010. On 11 March 2011, the Government ordered the MIC and the provincial Governor to close the club within three days. The club closed on 13 March 2011. Sanum and Savan Vegas petitioned the Prime Minister to re-open the club. The petition was denied on 19 May 2011 and Savan Vegas was ordered to comply with Notice No. 305.\n\n**7.3.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent's closure of the Paksan slot club constitutes an unlawful taking. In the Statement of Claim, the Claimant attributes the closure to the dissatisfaction of ST with the Claimant on whether revenues of the Paksan slot club and the concomitant tax obligations should be consolidated with those of Savan Vegas. As told by the Claimant, \"[i]n a meeting they [ST] had with Sanum in the fall of 2010, ST demanded they be paid 30% of Paksan's gaming revenues, regardless of what any agreement said. If Sanum did not agree, ST would have the club shut down... ST then proceeded to make good on their threat. Sanum soon learned that ST had convinced officials at the MIC to issue a notice instructing Savan Vegas to close the Paksan club.\"139\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 100.\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimant also disputes the Respondent's contention that most patrons were Lao people because there is no bridge at Paksan. The Claimant points out that there is a ferry to cross to and from Thailand. Secondly, this argument was not used to close the club as it is evident in the minutes of the Government meeting held on 11 March 2011 where the closure was decided.140 The minutes only refer to Notices No. 305 and 470/MCD that Savan Vegas claims not to have seen earlier. Indeed, in the case of Notice No. 305, Savan Vegas affirms that it became aware of it in this arbitration.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 175.\n\n226.\n\nThe Claimant points out that, \"prior to filing its Statement of Defense in this arbitration, Laos had never asserted that the closure of Paksan was justified by non-compliance with the Savan Vegas PDA, failure to obtain a separate Foreign Investment License, or the MIC's supposed lack of authority to issue slot club licenses. In fact, Savan Vegas was never made aware of the existence of Notice No. 1957 until this arbitration.\"141 Furthermore, the Claimant recalls that the Respondent withdrew the accusing witness statement on Lao people being allowed to gamble at the Paksan Hotel.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 169.\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that, \"although Paksan's license had expired at the time of the club's closure, by permitting the club to continue operating without a license and by assuring Savan Vegas that its license was in the process of being renewed, the Government *de facto* extended Sanum's rights in the Paksan investment.\"142\n\n*Ibid*., para. 171.\n\n**7.3.3. The Respondent's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nIn the Reply, the Claimant questions the merit of Laos's attempt to rely on a number of Government instruments that it claims deprived the MIC of authority to issue slot club licenses. Notice No.1957, issued by the Prime Minister's Office on 4 November 2008, did not, as Laos now claims, require that all slot club licenses be issued by the Prime Minister's Office rather than by the MIC. Critically, Notice No. 1957 is titled 'Solution for the slot machine business issues in Khammouan Province and Vientiane City', and it is addressed only to the governors of those areas, as well as the MIC, the MPI, and the Minister of Public Security. Thus, on its face, it has no application to Bolikhamxay Province, where the Paksan slot club was located. Moreover, Notice No. 1957 provides that 'the Government', and not just the Prime Minister's Office, has the right to issue slot club licenses. The MIC is undoubtedly part of the Lao Government. As to Notice No. 545, issued by the Prime Minister in March 2008, and now claimed by Laos to 'have barred new casinos and slot clubs', this was issued after Paksan received its first operating license in 2007.143\n\nReply, para. 168. Footnotes omitted.\n\n229.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, the Respondent affirms that a \"*de facto*\" license cannot be expropriated \"when the real one year license had expired.\"144 The Respondent admits that it is the first time that it argues that Savan Vegas was not authorized to operate a slot club in Paksan. The Respondent states: \"it is the first time, but the position is correct in law. A party operating outside the terms of its license and concession agreement cannot claim an illegal expropriation of an illegal business.\"145\n\nRejoinder, para. 101.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 102.\n\n**7.3.4. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nA first issue to be addressed by the Tribunal is the disputed meaning of monopoly in the PDA. Article 9 reads as follows:\n\nThe Company has been granted monopoly rights for its casino business operation only with the condition that the Government shall not approve and grant any other parties or entities who put up their applications for the operation of certain casino business in the two neighboring provinces close to the project development zone of the Company, namely Salavan and Champasak throughout the concession period of 50 years.\n\nHowever, should there have any applications submitted by any parties or entities, all those shall be made through the consent and approval of both the government and the authorized investors who have management rights.\"146\n\nPDA, Article 9, para. 24, RE-04.\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimant's argument that Savan Vegas' foreign investment license permitted Savan Vegas to operate gambling facilities in all three provinces where it had monopoly finds no support in the terms of the PDA. The Claimant and ST in fact recognized the need to have a specific slot license at Paksan and applied for its renewal year after year. On the other hand, the argument of the Respondent that the Paksan operation was illegal under the Law on Investment Promotion may be correct in law, as affirmed by the Respondent in the Rejoinder,147 but of doubtful persuasiveness when the MIC had issued the Paksan slot club a license three times during the period 2007-2009.\n\nRejoinder, para. 102.\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent has argued that the license was terminated in February 2010 and that the Claimant had operated the Paksan slot club without a license for about a year. On the other hand, the Claimant has affirmed that it was not aware of Notice No. 305 of 18 February 2010.148 Irrespective of whether the license was terminated by order of the Prime Minister's Office, it is undisputed that the Paksan slot club continued to operate beyond the term of its license. For the Tribunal, the key fact is that the license granted in 2009 had expired in October 2010 and had not been renewed. Monopoly rights kept competitors out but did not entitle Savan Vegas to establish and operate other gambling facilities unless those other facilities were specifically authorized. The Claimant has not shown that Savan Vegas had a right to the license's renewal or even that it attempted to renew the license.\n\nNotice to the MIC and the governor of the Bolikhamxay Province, dated February 18, 2010, Exhibit C(S)-326, p. 3.\n\n233.\n\nAt the time of the Paksan slot club's closure, the club was operating without a license and there is no documentary evidence that the Respondent had created any legitimate expectation in the Claimant that the license would be renewed or that it may operate *de facto* as if it had a license. The Claimant's argument about a *de facto* license begs the question of why Sanum had applied for the license's renewal in the preceding years. The Tribunal concludes that the license expired on its own terms and had terminated when the slot club was ordered to be closed.\n\n**7.4. Thakhet Casino and Hotel Resort**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**7.4.1. Background**\n---------------------\n\n234.\n\nIn 2010, Sanum started negotiations with the Committee for the Laos-Thailand Friendship Bridge III Economic Zone Development (the \"SEZ\" and the \"SEZ Committee\") for a land concession at the foot of a planned bridge to cross the Mekong River. The negotiations resulted in a MOU between Sanum and the SEZ Committee dated 20 October 2010. The MOU contemplated a land concession to Sanum of about 90 hectares in the SEZ, payment by Sanum of $900,000 to allow the provincial government to compensate individuals occupying the land, and $400,000 to be paid upon signature of the MOU. The MOU required Sanum to sign a land concession within 30 days and secure all necessary approvals from the central and local governments within one year prior to building on the concession land.\n\n235.\n\nOn 4 February 2011, Savan Vegas submitted a proposal for a slot club to the Governor of the Khammouane Province and the MIC. The proposal was supported by the Governor and, on 21 February 2011, the MIC approved the Savan Vegas's Welcome Center and Slot Club. Shortly thereafter, on 2 March 2011, the Prime Minister's Office directed the MIC to revoke its approval because slot club licenses may only be issued \"by the Government\", which was interpreted by the Prime Minister to mean the Prime Minister's Office.149 On 29 March 2011, Sanum and Savan Vegas petitioned the Prime Minister's Office to grant permission to open the Welcome Center and Slot Club in the SEZ. The petition was rejected in October 2011.\n\nNotice from the Prime Minister's Office to the Minister of Information and Culture, 2 March 2011, Exhibit C(B)-337.\n\n**7.4.2. The Claimant's Argument**\n----------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the SEZ Committee had been negotiating with Sanum a PDA and a land concession for the project, and by the end of 2011 the negotiations were near completion. But then, \"the Government sent Sanum a substantially revised PDA, which removed approximately 16 hectares from the land that the SEZ Committee had previously committed to grant Sanum in the MOU.\" The Claimant affirms that the removal of these 16 hectares compromised the feasibility of the project because they fronted Highway 13 and the access road to the bridge.\n\n237.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the map above, which was appended to the 2010 MOU, showed Sanum's Highway 13 Frontage. However, the Respondent notes that Sanum never made an application for a license or PDA to the MPI for the Thakhet development, as required by the Law on Investment Protection. Instead, on 4 February 2011, Savan Vegas applied to the MIC for a license for a small slot club. At the time, because of the order to close Paksan, Savan Vegas should have been aware that the MIC had no authority to approve gambling licenses. In the application, Savan Vegas referred to the MOU and attached the PDA, under which Savan Vegas affirmed that it had the right to operate in three provinces. On 21 February 2011, the MIC authorized gambling in Thakhet. On 2 March 2011, the Prime Minister revoked the authorization and re-affirmed this decision on 7 October 2011 in view of the further request of Savan Vegas on 29 March 2011. At the request of Sanum, the president of Sanum met with relevant ministries on 25 November 2011, and again it was reiterated to Sanum that the authorization to operate slot machines in Khammouane Province was illegal.\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimant in the Reply points out that the SEZ Committee was appointed by the central Government, that the Government specifically instructed Sanum to negotiate the PDA and land concession agreement with the SEZ Committee, and that the 30 days to sign the land concession run as from approval by the SEZ Committee of a feasibility study, master plan, social-economic and environmental impact study. The Claimant contends that it submitted these documents, but negotiations of the PDA fell apart because of the removal of the 16 key hectares. The Claimant points out the changing reasons adduced by the Government to justify the removal of those hectares. First, the Respondent had said that there was a holdout landowner who wanted more money; later, it argued that the 16 hectares were never included in the concession.\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimant affirms that at the time it was not aware of Notice No. 305, and that, in any case, this Notice does not deprive the MIC of its authority to issue slot licenses. According to the Claimant, Savan Vegas reasonably believed that the MIC was the relevant authority to which it should direct its application. This understanding was supported by Respondent's contemporaneous actions. For example, the Khammouane Governor wrote to the MIC a letter of support on the province's behalf. The MIC approved the application on 21 February 2011.150\n\nReply, para. 189.\n\n**7.4.3. The Respondent's Argument**\n------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant has not been able to rebut the Respondent's position that Sanum never obtained a license, a concession or a PDA from the Respondent. The Respondent points out that in the Reply, the Claimant admits that the parties had not reached agreement on whether the 16 hectares were included in the land concession or the terms of the PDA: \"it is patently clear as a matter of law that when parties do not agree on material terms during the negotiations, they do not have an agreement. The parties never concluded those negotiations and never signed the agreements.\"151\n\nRejoinder, para. 105.\n\n241.\n\nAt the closing of the Hearing, the Respondent explained that the 16-hectare issue was irrelevant because the key land was next to the bridge on the side of the river rather than on the road frontage land as there would be a need to isolate the gambling area, including space for customs control.\n\n242.\n\nAs regards the slot license, the Respondent has alleged that it was obtained through bribes paid by Mr. Bouker to Mr. Boumong at the MIC.\n\n**7.4.4. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nIt was decided in the Tribunal's ruling on the Merits of the Claimant's Second Material Breach Application that, in the Tribunal's view,\n\nthe Claimant has not established a land entitlement that includes the disputed 16 hectares, and there is no undertaking by the Government in Section 22 to use its powers of eminent domain to expropriate the existing private owners for the financial benefit of the Claimant. Refusal to expropriate private land for the private gain of the Claimant does not constitute evidence of 'bad faith.'152\n\nDecision on the Merits of the Claimant's Second Material Breach Application, 15 December 2017, para. 195.\n\n244.\n\nThis decision was reached by the Tribunal in the context of whether the Government breached Article 22 of the Deed of Settlement by failing to negotiate the Thakhet related agreements in good faith. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants have also failed to establish rights to the remainder of the land referred to in the MOU. Sanum had 365 days from the date of the Land Concession Agreement to seek all the approvals for all investment activities described in the MOU. In turn, before the Land Concession Agreement could be signed, Sanum needed to complete a Feasibility Study, a Master Plan and a Socio-Economic and Environmental Impact Study for the Land Concession, all to be approved by the Concessioner. The Land Concession Agreement required by the MOU was never signed; it never went beyond the negotiation stage. Despite face to face negotiations over the PDA throughout the summer and fall of 2011, Sanum and the SEZ Committee had not finalized the terms of the PDA, including the land concession.153 In the overall picture, whether or not Sanum had obtained a licence had no impact on the viability of its Thakhaek project.\n\nReply, para. 182; Exhibit SRE-101.\n\n245.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal it is clear from the MOU that Savan Vegas could not expand to Thakhaek in the Kammouane Province without the \"**final approval from all governmental authorities (central and local)**.\"154 The MOU provides for the eventuality that the approval is forthcoming and also in case it is not.155 Furthermore, the MOU subjects the exact location of the Concession Land to a future agreement: \"Once the exact location of the Concession Land has been agreed upon, the Concessionee will confirm its acceptance of the Concession Land in writing to the Concessioner.\"156 There was never any agreement in this respect.\n\nMOU, clause 2.3(c).\n\nMOU, clauses 2.3(c) and (d).\n\nMOU, clause 3.1.\n\n246.\n\nThe MOU shows that Savan Vegas' monopoly rights did not encompass a right to establish slot clubs or casinos beyond the area covered by the Savan Vegas PDA:\n\nIf the Concessionee would like to expand the casino or slot business of Savan Vegas, which is an investment project of Sanum Investments Limited according to the Foreign Investment License no. 09507 [not readable], dated 17 August 2007 to the Concession Land to be a branch (Welcome Center) of Savan Vegas *such expansion shall be proposed, approved and agreed in writing from the Government* first before implementing such expansion. The Khammouane Province wilfully [sic] support the expansion of Savan Vegas to the Land Concession according to the appropriate procedures and regulations.157\n\nMOU, clause 3.3.\n\n247.\n\nAs regards to the slot license, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent's witnesses from the MIC and the Government Secretariat Office have claimed that the license was issued by mistake.158 The Respondent has argued that the MIC had no authority to issue the license because of Notice No. 1957 of the Prime Minister and says that the license was procured by a bribe. Leaving aside the issue of the bribes allegedly paid by the Claimants, the Tribunal observes that the license was effective for less than ten days and that the revocation was justified on the lack of authority of the MIC to grant it. The Tribunal appreciates that Notice No. 1957 refers to the Government and is not explicitly limited to the Prime Minister's office but by 2011 Sanum was fully aware that the Prime Minister's Office was the essential authority on the Claimants' gambling ventures in Laos. The Prime Minister's Office never approved the Claimants' gambling project in Thakhaek. The Claimants had just finished a bruising encounter with the Government over the Claimants' failure to fulfill its obligations in respect of the Paksong Hotel and Casino project. By 2011, the Claimants had entirely failed to live up to their Paksong commitments, while pretending otherwise. The Claimants had demonstrated themselves not to be good faith investors.\n\nReply, para. 316 and footnote 767: Witness Statements of Xypheng Vongpanya, at para. 7, and of Phimphone Sengthong at para. 9.\n\n248.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimants were seeking in bad faith (even if not by bribes) to manipulate Government officials to obtain approvals to which the Claimants were not entitled. It is significant that the MIC licence was issued to Sanum in February 2011 by the same Minister that was ordered to cancel the Paksan license for lack of authority one year earlier in February 2010.\n\n249.\n\nNegotiations for the renewal of the Flat Tax Agreement had stalled by March 2011. The Government was agitating for accountability in respect of its 20% interest in Savan Vegas. The Claimant alleges that the 16-hectare parcel on Highway 13 was essential to the success of the Thakhaek project, yet negotiations for the 16-hectare parcel never reached agreement in the Tribunal's view. Thus Sanum acquired no rights in Thakhaek property. There was no Land Concession Agreement for a site on which gambling facilities *could* be built. The other approvals that would have been required contingent on the signing of the Land Concession Agreement (which never happened) became moot. The Thakhaek project was not expropriated. The licence was revoked for good and sufficient cause. The project itself never came into legal existence. The MOU provided that the Claimant's Thakhaek project could not proceed without \"the final approval of, by or from all Government authorities (central and local)\" which was never obtained. The Tribunal appreciates the chagrin of the Claimant at paying US $400,000 which, in the end, did not result in a viable project but the failure cannot be attributed to any actionable fault on the part of the Government.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that there is insufficient evidence of bad faith on either side in respect of Thakhek. It was simply a commercial possibility that never reached the stage of agreement.\n\n**8. COSTS**\n------------\n\n251.\n\nThe Respondent Government claims costs for the period from 23 February 2017 through 22 February 2019 in respect of lawyers' fees in the amount of US$ 1,161,611.48 and expenses of US$ 151,640.83, being in total US$1,313,252.31. These fees are exclusive of and apart from the costs sought by the Government arising out of *Lao Holdings N.V. v. The Government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, which was not consolidated with this case, but for the most part heard jointly with it. (The Respondent Government claims a total of $2,780,736.03 in respect of both the ICSID and PCA proceedings). By way of comparison, the Claimants indicated that if successful (and even if not wholly successful) they would be seeking $20,929,951.36 in total in respect of both the ICSID and PCA proceedings. The Claimant's claim, unlike the Respondent's claim, does include the expenses and charges of the respective Secretariats.\n\n252.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\n\n2. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n253.\n\nArticle 42 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\n(1) The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n(2) The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\n\n254.\n\nAccording to Article 42, the costs of the arbitration \"shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties\" but grants the Tribunal discretionary power to apportion costs, based on what is reasonable in the circumstances of the case. While there is some variation in tribunals' practices, the prevailing approach of international investment tribunals is to order costs to follow the event. The Claimants themselves have endorsed this principle in putting forward their own claim for the \"costs and expenses of this proceeding, including attorneys' fees\".4\n\n255.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the quantum of their original claims if wholly successful, might have reached US $1 billion.\n\n256.\n\nThe costs claim advanced by Sanum and LHNV include US $10,109,872.71 for legal work prior to the Settlement of 15 June 2014. The Respondent's claim commences post-settlement, specifically from 23 February 2017 \u2014 i.e., after the date Claimant Sanum filed its Second Material Breach Application before the PCA Tribunal. From and after 23 February 2017, the two cases (PCA Case No. 2013-13 and ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6) proceeded in parallel although, as mentioned, not consolidated.5 Thus, after 23 February 2017, work on all written submissions, evidentiary applications, interim conferences and hearings as well as the Hearing were combined, then evenly divided as between the PCA proceedings and the ICSID proceedings. In the result, the Respondent seeks an order that the Claimant Sanum pay 50% of its legal costs, including lawyers' fees and expenses, incurred from 23 February 2017 through the present.\n\n257.\n\nThe Claimant points out that it was successful on a number of the interlocutory matters including a defeat of the Government's jurisdictional challenges and establishment in the Second Material Breach Application, that the Government had failed in two important aspects to honour the Settlement, namely, the establishment of a new FTA to assist in the sale of Savan Vegas, and the Government's failure to halt existing and potential criminal proceedings. These were important successes for the Claimants, but in the end, they failed to establish after years of litigation any liability on the part of the Government in respect of any of their myriad of claims of Treaty violations (as distinguished from two breaches of the 2014 Settlement Agreement, as mentioned).\n\n258.\n\nIn the circumstances the Tribunal thinks it appropriate, in its discretion, to award the Respondent Government its costs.\n\n**8.1. Expenses**\n-----------------\n\n**8.1.1. Travel Expenses**\n--------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe Respondent's travel expenses represent travel to Singapore twice by various witnesses and the Respondent's lawyers and staff, for matters involving the Tribunal. These travel expenses also include travel to Laos, Paris, and Hong Kong for matters such as fact development, evidence gathering and document review.159\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 18.\n\n**8.1.2. Miscellaneous Services and Expenses**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe remainder of the Respondent's expenses relate to services and expenses required to pursue the arbitrations, some of which were incurred in-house and others by external vendors. Such services include translation services; court reporter and transcript fees; express delivery expenses; research; and trial preparation services in Singapore, such as copying, binding presentations, and creating witness and evidentiary notebooks.\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent's total expenses (other than legal fees) requested in this arbitration amount to US $151,640.83.160 This sum, taken together with legal fees of US $1,161,611.48, produces a total cost award of US $1,313,252.31.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 19-20.\n\n**8.2. Arbitration Costs**\n--------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, PCA registry fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\nArbitrators' fees\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dr. Rigo Sureda161 Prof. Hanotiau162\\* Prof. Stern163\\* | US $529,880.84 US $427,888.71 US $441,258.91 |\n| Travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators | US $90,737.66 |\n| Costs of PCA registry and other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal |  |\n| PCA registry fees | US $155,593.00 |\n| PCA registry expenses | US $23,343.89 |\n| Other expenses | US $104,168.85 |\n| **Total** | US $1,772,871.86 |\n\nIn Euro, Dr. Rigo Sureda's fees amount to EUR 425,538.75.\n\nIn Euro, Prof. Hanotiau's fees amount to EUR 339,983.60.\n\nThe fees and expenses of Prof. Hanotiau and Prof. Stern have been equally divided between the PCA and ICSID proceedings. The amount shown here represents the PCA portion.\n\nIn Euro, Prof. Stern's fees amount to EUR 350,968.81.\n\nThe fees and expenses of Prof. Hanotiau and Prof. Stern have been equally divided between the PCA and ICSID proceedings. The amount shown here represents the PCA portion.\n\n263.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties, which were not made in equal parts. The Claimant made advance payments for a total of US $1,355,000.00 and the Respondent made advances for a total of US $465,000.00. The Tribunal orders the Claimant Sanum to bear all the arbitration costs of the PCA proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and PCA. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent US $465,000 for the expended portion of the Respondent's advances to the PCA.\n\n**9. DISPOSITION**\n------------------\n\n264.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimants have failed to meet the evidentiary onus of establishing facts necessary to support their legal arguments. The claims are therefore dismissed.\n\n265.\n\nThe Claimant Sanum shall pay the Respondent its legal costs of US $1,313,252.31.\n\n266.\n\nThe Claimant Sanum shall bear all the arbitration costs of the PCA proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and PCA. Accordingly, the Claimant Sanum shall pay the Respondent US $465,000 for the expended portion of the Respondent's advances to the PCA. The PCA shall reimburse the unexpended balance of the deposit to the Claimant Sanum in the amount of US $47,128.14."}]}
