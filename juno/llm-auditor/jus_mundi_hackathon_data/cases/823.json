On the same day, the Secretary-General registered the Request in the Arbitration Register and notified the Parties accordingly.\n\n3.\n\nOn August 29, 1984, the Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties by telex that:\n\n... the Arabic text of Article 8 of Law No. 43 of 1974 refers to the settlement of disputes within the framework of the ICSID Convention in the cases where it (i.e., the Convention) applies, and not, as erroneously mentioned in the English translation, where Law No. 90 of 1971 ratifying the Convention applies. I have thus registered the request of SPP without prejudice to the question whether the said Article eight constitutes consent for the purposes of the ICSID Convention or merely includes a reference to this Convention in the cases where consent for ICSID Jurisdiction is issued separately. This matter, if raised, will be for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide.\n\n4.\n\nOn August 29, 1984, the Centre received from SPP(ME) a proposal that a sole arbitrator be appointed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 2(1)(a), or, alternatively, that the Parties jointly nominate an individual as President of the Tribunal.\n\n5.\n\nIn a communication received by the Centre on November 12, 1984, Egypt stated that it contested the Centre's competence with respect to the present dispute, and that no action undertaken in proceedings concerning SPP(ME)\u2019s request could be deemed a renunciation of such jurisdictional objections. Egypt rejected SPP(ME)\u2019s proposals for the constitution of the Tribunal, and proposed as an alternative a Tribunal consisting of three members, with Dr Eduardo JIMENEZ DE ARECHAGA serving as President of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 4, the Parties agreed on November 26, 1984. to extend to December 3, 1984, the period for nominating their respective arbitrators and for agreement on the President of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn November 26, 1984, Egypt designated Dr Mohamed Amin EL MAHDI, an Egyptian national, as an arbitrator pursuant to Arbitration Rule 3. SPP(ME) informed the Centre on November 30, 1984, that it did not object to the nationality of the arbitrator named by Egypt, as it might have done under Arbitration Rule 3(1)(a)(i), and that it was designating Mr Robert F. PIETROWSKI, Jr, a US national, as an arbitrator. Further, SPP(ME) informed the Centre that it consented to Egypt\u2019s proposal that Dr JIMENEZ DE ARECHAGA be appointed President of the Tribunal. Dr JIMENEZ DE ARECHAGA accepted his appointment on December 5, 1984. and Mr PIETROWSKI accepted his appointment on December 7, 1984.\n\n8.\n\nOn December 18, 1984, the Centre received notice that Dr EL MAHDI accepted his appointment as an arbitrator, and the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Tribunal was constituted and that the proceedings were deemed to have begun in accordance with Arbitration Rule 6(1).\n\n9.\n\nOn February 8, 1985, the Tribunal conducted a preliminary meeting with the Parties at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague, the Parties placed on record their agreement to the effect that:\n\n... the Tribunal has been properly constituted in accordance with Section 2 of the ICSID Convention and Chapter 1 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 20 it was decided that the Arbitration Rules in effect up to September 26, 1984, would apply; that the procedural languages would be English and French; and that the seat of the arbitration would be Washington. DC.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal decided at the preliminary meeting to suspend the proceedings on the merits pending a decision on Egypt's jurisdictional objections, and that the proceedings on jurisdiction would consist of written pleadings and oral argument, the following schedule was set for the filing of the written pleadings on jurisdiction;\n\n(a) Egypt's observations to be filed by May 8, 1985; and\n\n(b) SPP(ME)\u2019s observations to be filed by June 19 1985.\n\n11.\n\nThe observations of both Parties were filed within the prescribed time limits. Egypt, in its observations, requested the Tribunal:\n\n... for all of the grounds explained above, to declare itself incompetent to hear the claims presented by SPP(ME).\n\nThe observations of SPP(ME) asked the Tribunal to:\n\n... reject the Respondent\u2019s objections to the Centre's jurisdiction over this dispute between SPP(ME) and the Government of Egypt regarding the State's failure to compensate this foreign investor for the losses it suffered as a result of the State's cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis project.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 8, 1985, the Centre received from Egypt a document responding to certain arguments set forth in SPP(ME)\u2019s observations concerning interpretation of Law No. 43.\n\n13.\n\nOral argument on the question of jurisdiction was held at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague on July 10 and 11, 1985, the hearings were recorded in the form of a verbatim transcript, in the English and French languages. At the end of the oral proceedings, the Tribunal requested that the Parties submit certain additional materials concerning Egyptian Law No. 43.\n\n14.\n\nOn July 23, 1985, the Parties advised the Centre that Southern Pacific Properties Limited (hereinafter called \"SPP\" or \"the Claimant\"), the parent company of SPP(ME) and also a Hong Kong corporation, had been joined as a claimant in the proceedings, subject to Egypt\u2019s reservation of jurisdictional defenses.\n\n15.\n\nIn response to the request made by the Tribunal at the end of the oral proceedings, the Claimants and the Respondent filed supplemental materials concerning Law No. 43 on August 21 and August 27, 1985.\n\n16.\n\nOn September 23, 1974. a contract entitled \"Heads of Agreement\" was entered into by the Government of Egypt (represented by the Minister of Tourism), the Egyptian General Organization for Tourism and Hotels (hereinafter called \"EGOTH\"), and SPP, a company engaged in the development of tourist and resort facilities, EGOTH was at the time a public sector enterprise under the Minister of Tourism, organized under Egyptian Law No. 60 of 1971.\n\n17.\n\nThe Heads of Agreement by its terms was entered into in accordance with certain Egyptian laws, including Law No. 43 of 1974 Concerning the Investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the Free Zone. In the Heads of Agreement. EGOTH and SPP undertook to incorporate an Egyptian joint venture company to develop tourist complexes at the Pyramids Oasis site near Cairo and at Ras El Hekma on the Mediterranean coast, these projects were to be developed according to detailed master plans prepared by SPP and approved by EGOTH The Ministry of Tourism agreed to secure the title to property and the possession of land necessary for the development of the proposed projects, the Ministry of Tourism and EGOTH undertook to transfer the right of usufruct for such property to the joint stock company as part of the capital investment, the Minister of Tourism and EGOTH undertook to assist in obtaining all local approval for the execution of the projects in accordance with the plans to be submitted by SPP and approved by f.goth. SPP for its part agreed to obtain the necessary financing for the projects, and to provide or arrange for all technical expertise required for designing, constructing, managing, and marketing the projects.\n\n18.\n\nThe Preamble of the Heads of Agreement, which was expressly made part of the agreement by Article 1, provided:\n\nWhereas the Ministry of Tourism approved granting both 2nd and 3rd party (i.e., EGOTH and SPP) the right to develop the areas as shown in the attached maps in the Pyramid's area and Ras El Hekma Zone.\n\nThis agreement is issued in accordance with laws No. 1 for the year 1973 relating to Hotels Installations and Tourism, and law No. 2 for the year 1972 relating to the supervision by the Ministry of Tourism on touristic sites and the development of such areas, and *law 43 for the year 1974 relating to Arab and foreign funds invested in the are with particular reference to government guarantees long term tax holidays, exemptions from import custom duties, etc.* (Emphasis added.)\n\nArticle 2 of the Heads of Agreement provided:\n\nBoth 2nd and 3rd parties undertake to incorporate promptly *an Egyptian joint venture company* of which 40 percent would be subscribed by EGOTH and 60 percent by SPP (for the Pyramid area) and 30 percent by EGOTH and 70 percent by SPP (for Ras El Hekma). (Emphasis added.)\n\nArticle 4 provided:\n\nFIRST Party will secure the title of property and possession of land and both First and second party undertake to transfer the right of usufruct to the joint company as its part of the capital investment. Both mt and EGOTH undertake to transfer such right to the joint company immediately upon incorporation, any balance being transferred not later than 90 days thereafter.\n\n19.\n\nOn December 12, 1974, a contract entitled \"Agreement for the Development of Two International Tourist Projects in Egypt\" (hereinafter called \u201fthe December Agreement\") was concluded between EGOTH and SPP concerning the projects at the Pyramids Oasis and Ras El Hekma sites. On the final page of the December Agreement, following the signatures of the representatives of EGOTH and SPP, there appeared the typewritten statement. \u201fApproved, agreed and ratified by the Minister of Tourism. His Excellency. Mr Ibrahim Naguib, on the Twelfth day of December, 1974\". Next to this statement the signature of the Minister and an official stamp were affixed.\n\n20.\n\nThe Preamble of the December Agreement referred to the Heads of Agreement saying that:\n\nFollowing execution of the Heads of Agreement dated 23rd September, 1974,... and subsequent negotiations between the above parties, the following are agreed...\n\nArticle 1 of the December Agreement then provided that a joint venture company with registered shares would be incorporated in Egypt for a renewable period of fifty years. This company, called the \"Egyptian Tourist Development Company\" (hereinafter referred to as \"ETDC\"), was to be responsible for the development and operation of the projects, the nominal capital of ETDC was initially set at two million United States dollars, to be increased to ten million dollars at the end of the fifth year. Sixty percent of this capital was to be subscribed by SPP, and the remaining forty percent by EGOTH. On the fiftieth anniversary of the incorporation of ETDC, EGOTH was to be entitled to increase its shareholding at no cost to fifty-percent of the total capital. *The participation of EGOTH in the capital of ETDC was represented by the rights of usufruct referred to in Articles 5 and 6 of the agreement.* Article 5 of the December Agreement stipulated that EGOTH would use its best efforts to secure all the necessary Government approvals to enable ETDC the immediate possession of the land in both sites, and to ensure the transfer of the rights of usufruct to ETDC for its duration.\n\n21.\n\nOn the same date that the December Agreement was signed, the representatives of EGOTH and SPP also signed a \"statement\" which provided:\n\nIt is understood between contracting parties (EGOTH) and (SPP) in concern of the agreement signed on the 12th of December 1974, that obligations which lie on EGOTH are subject to the approval of the competent governmental authorities and that the feasibility study proves the profitability of the projects.\n\n22.\n\nThe December Agreement was expressly concluded in accordance with certain Egyptian laws, including Law No. 43. It contained an arbitration clause which provided that any disputes relating to the agreement would be submitted to the International Chamber of Commerce (hereinafter called \"the ICC\") in Paris, France, for arbitration.\n\n23.\n\nThe December Agreement also provided that SPP would incorporate a holding company to own its shareholding in the joint venture. Article 17 of the December Agreement provided:\n\nIt is understood that SPP will be incorporating a holding company to own its shareholding in ETDC and it is agreed that SPP shall have the right to assign its rights, privileges, duties and obligations under this Agreement to this company in which SPP will have a controlling, but not necessarily majority, interest and in which it controls and directs management, provided the company satisfies EGOTH...\n\nSuch an assignment was subsequently made to SPP(ME), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPP formed in 1974 to undertake the execution of the projects at the Pyramids Oasis and Ras El Hekma sites.\n\n24.\n\nBy a letter dated April 12, 1975, the Board of Directors of the General Organization for Investment of Arab Capital and Tax-Free Zones (hereinafter called \"the General Organization for Investment\") approved the application for the establishment of a combined tourist company by EGOTH and SPP for the development of the tourist areas at the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma sites. This approval was conditioned upon the presentation by the joint venture company to the Board of Directors of a complete economic feasibility study, the decision provided that the beneficial rights would be for a period of 50 years and then would revert to the State. This period was subsequently extended to 99 years, subject to compliance with certain Egyptian laws.\n\n25.\n\nOn May 22, 1975, the President of Egypt issued Decree No. 475 of 1975 \"[t]o specify the use of the lands on Pyramids Site and Ras El Hekma Site... for tourist purposes\", the Decree provided that EGOTH \"will either alone or with one of the Companies in which it is a partner develop and use these two sites\".\n\n26.\n\nOn October 19, 1975, EGOTH as sole owner of the sites mentioned in Presidential Decree No. 475. irrevocably transferred its right of usufruct for the sites \"without restriction of any kind\" to the joint venture ETDC. This right of usufruct was transferred for the life of ETDC.\n\n27.\n\nOn November 12, 1975. a contract between EGOTH and SPP(ME) for the incorporation of a joint venture was concluded in conformity with Law No. 1 of 1973 Concerning Tourist Establishments and Law No. 43 of 1974, the incorporation was authorized by Ministerial Decree No. 212 of 1975. This Decree referred in its preamble to the Decrees of the Prime Minister, No. 91 of 1975 Promulgating the Executive Regulations of Law No. 43 of 1974. and No. 92 of 1975 Concerning the Pattern of Contract and Statutes Covering the Projects Created Under the Provisions of Law No. 43.\n\n28.\n\nBy a letter dated April 1, 1976, the Chairman of EGOTH notified the Chairman of ETDC of the \"formal approval of the mt (Ministry of Tourism) and EGOTH of the Pyramids Oasis project as a whole...\"\n\n29.\n\nOn October 19, 1976, the Minister of Tourism wrote to the Chairman of ETDC, stating:\n\nI am writing to confirm my formal approval to the development and construction of your project... This approval entitles you to proceed with your programme without the necessity of further reference to this Ministry.\n\n30.\n\nFinally, on June 1, 1977, Ministerial Decree No. 96 of 1977, was issued. Article 1 of this Decree provided:\n\nThe Ministry of Tourism approves the master planning for the tourist Pyramids Plateau Area, as well as the detailed planning of the first phase regarding the implementation of villages nos. 1, 3 and 21 of the project of exploiting the tourist Giza Pyramids Plateau...\n\n31.\n\nConstruction work began at the Pyramids Oasis site in July of 1977, the Claimants have explained in their pleadings that such construction work commenced with roads, sewage systems, water reservoir facilities, artificial lakes, and a golf course.\n\n32.\n\nIn late 1977, the Pyramids Oasis project began to encounter political opposition in Egypt, and it became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. Opponents of the project claimed that it posed a threat to undiscovered antiquities.\n\n33.\n\nIn a decree issued on May 27, 1978, the Ministry of Culture declared \"[t]he land surrounding the Pyramids\" to be public property. This decree was issued upon the recommendation of the Egyptian Antiquities Authority, which confirmed the presence of antiquities in the western part of the Al Giza Pyramids region.\n\n34.\n\nOn 28 May 1978, the General Organization for Investments, by Resolution 1/51-78. \"decided to drop its former issued agreement... concerning the Pyramids Plateau...\"\n\n35.\n\nOn 19 June 1978, the Presidential Decree No. 267 cancelled Presidential Decree No. 475 which had designated \"the lands on the Pyramids plateau in Giza for touristic exploitation\". Finally, on July 11, 1978, the Prime Minister of Egypt issued a decree declaring these same land *d'utile publique.*\n\n36.\n\nAt the request of EGOTH, ETDC was put under judicial trusteeship by a judgment of the Giza Court for Urgent Matters rendered on June 19, 1978, the court appointed trustees who were put in charge of the management of the company's assets until a general meeting of the shareholders could take place, the trusteeship remains in effect.\n\n37.\n\nOn December 7, 1978. SPP and SPP(ME) filed a request for arbitration with the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris against the are and EGOTH, under the arbitration clause in the December Agreement. Egypt objected to the jurisdiction of the ICC tribunal. In the *acte de mission.* Egypt and EGOTH stated:\n\nThe FIRST and SECOND DEFENDANTS wish to make it clear that their submission of an ANSWER and COUNTER-CLAIM does not constitute in any way an acceptance of the initiation of this arbitration proceedings, their refusal of the arbitration proceedings is to remain firm until the Arbitrators render their final decision on the matter of jurisdiction. In case the Arbitrators affirm their jurisdiction over the subject matter at issue, the COUNTER-CLAIM shall be comprised within the said jurisdiction.\n\n38.\n\nThe ICC tribunal, in an award rendered on February 16, 1983, held *inter alia\",*\n\n1. That the first Defendant, the Arab Republic of Egypt, pay to the First Claimant. Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited, the sum of US $I2,500,000 (twelve million five hundred thousand) together with interest thereof at the rate of *5%* per annum from the date in which the request for arbitration was received by the Secretary of the ICC Court of Arbitration (i.e. 1st December 1978) until payment.\n\n2. That the claim by both Claimants against the Second Defendant, the Egyptian General Company for Tourism and Hotels, be dismissed.\n\n3. That the counterclaim by the said second Defendant against the Claimants be dismissed.\n\nIn dismissing the claim against EGOTH, the ICC tribunal added:\n\nDifferent considerations might well apply if the Government had not been a party to the December, 1974 Agreement.\n\n39.\n\nOn March 28, 1983, Egypt appealed the ICC award to the Paris Court of Appeals.\n\n40.\n\nBy a letter dated August 15, 1983, SPP(ME) notified the Minister of Tourism that in its view the ICC award \"is binding between the parties and finally dispositive of our dispute\", on the basis of Article 24 of the ICC Rules which says that:\n\nBy submitting the dispute to arbitration by the International Chamber of Commerce, the parties shall be deemed to have undertaken to carry out the resulting award without delay and to have waived their right to any form of appeal insofar as such waiver can validly be made.\n\nAt the same time, SPP(ME) added in its letter of August 15, 1983, that\n\n[R]ecognizing that your Government has taken the position that the ICC award was rendered without a jurisdictional basis, we hereby notify you that we accept and reserve the opportunity of availing ourselves of the uncontestable jurisdiction of the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, under the auspices of the World Bank, which is open to us as a result of Law No. 43 of 1974. Article 8 of which provides that investment disputes may be settled by ICSID arbitration.\n\nSPP(ME) also affirmed that:\n\n... This notification does not affect our reliance on the ICC Award, nor does it constitute a waiver of any rights to have the ICC Award immediately recognized and enforced by judicial procedure.\n\n41.\n\nOn March 21, 1984, the Paris Court of Appeals annulled the ICC award on the ground that Egypt was not a party to the December Agreement and therefore was not bound by the ICC clause therein.\n\n43.\n\nOn the same date, the District Court of Amsterdam granted *exequatur* to the ICC award.\n\n44.\n\nOn November 28, 1984, the Claimants referred the decision of the Paris Court of Appeals to the French Court of Cassation *(Pourvoi No.* 84/17-274), requesting that the decision be set aside. This request is presently pending. In the meantime, SPP(ME) has agreed that it will not seek enforcement of the ICC award in the Netherlands as long as the Paris Court of Appeals decision stands.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal will now proceed to the consideration of its competence with respect to the present dispute, the general rules which determine the jurisdiction of the Centre, and hence the competence of the Tribunal, are laid down in Article 25 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (hereinafter called \"the ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\"), these rules prescribe three prerequisites for the jurisdiction of the Centre: the parties to the dispute must be. on the one hand, a \"Contracting State,\" i.e., a party to the Convention, or a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State which has been designated to the Centre by the Contracting State, and, on the other hand, a national of another Contracting State. Article 25 defines the term \"national of another Contracting State\" to include \"any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\" The dispute itself must be a legal one \"arising directly out of an investment.\" Finally, the parties must have consented \"in writing\" to submit the dispute to the Centre. Unless the Parties have conferred jurisdiction on the Centre in accordance with Article 25, the Tribunal lacks competence to hear the present case.\n\n46.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that the dispute is between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. Egypt is a party to the Convention and therefore a \"Contracting State\" within the meaning of Article 25. SPP and SPP(ME) are Hong Kong corporations. Hong Kong is a territory for whose international relations the United Kingdom, also a party to the Convention, is responsible. Article 70 of the Convention provides that:\n\nThis Convention shall apply to all territories for whose international relations a Contracting State is responsible, except those which are excluded by such State by written notice to the depositary of this Convention cither at the time of ratification, acceptance or approval or subsequently.\n\nThe United Kingdom expressly extended the application of the Convention to Hong Kong in 1967. SPP and SPP(ME) are thus both \"nationals of another Contracting State\" within the meaning of Article 25.\n\n47.\n\nNor does there appear to be any issue in the present case as to whether the controversy is a \"dispute arising directly out of an investment.\" Egypt has argued that the claim in this case relates only to non-performance of contracts, and that Egypt's Investment Law No. 43, which the Claimants rely on for jurisdictional purposes, is therefore not applicable to the present dispute. Nowhere has Egypt asserted that the dispute does not arise \"directly out of an investment\" within the meaning of Article 25, however.\n\n48.\n\nWhere the Parties do disagree is on the question of whether they have consented in writing to submit the present dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre, the Claimants contend that Egypt gave advance consent to the Centre\u2019' jurisdiction when it enacted law No. 43 in 1974, and that their own consent was expressed in the letter from SPP(ME)\u2019s Managing Director. Mr A. Anthony McLellan, to Egypt's Minister of Tourism, dated August 15, 1983. and again by the act of filing their request in the present case.\n\n49.\n\nThe consent of the parties to the dispute is the fundamental condition of the jurisdiction of ICSID, the Preamble of the Convention declares that:\n\n... no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\n\nIn the same vein, the Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention asserts that \"consent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Center\".\n\n50.\n\nThe Convention does not prescribe any particular form for the consent required to establish the Centre's jurisdiction, other than that it be \"in writing\". The consent need not be contained in a single written instrument, as made clear in the Report of the Executive Directors, which states:\n\nNor does the Convention require that consent of both parties be expressed in a single instrument. Thus, a host State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes arising out of certain classes of investments to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and the investor might give his consent by accepting the offer in writing.\n\n51.\n\nAscertaining that consent exists is a task that this Tribunal must approach with great care. In a consultation submitted by the Respondent, dated July 1, 1985. it was argued that in this case the investment law itself does not constitute a written consent within the meaning of Article 25. and consequently that the Convention is not applicable. However, in the oral proceedings. Respondent stated that it did not deny the theoretical possibility that a Contracting State might incorporate an advance consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre in its investment promotion legislation.\n\n52.\n\nEgypt's objections to the Centre's jurisdiction are based on three grounds: first, that the Claimants themselves have not consented to the Centre's jurisdiction; second, that Law No. 43 is not applicable in the present case; and. third, that, even if Law No. 43 were applicable. Article 8 thereof would not suffice to establish Egypt's consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, the Tribunal will now consider these objections *seriatim.*\n\n53.\n\nEgypt maintains as its first objection that the Claimants' pursuit of an ICC remedy has in effect rendered their alleged consent to ICSID jurisdiction illusory. This contention is based on the language of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, which provides, in pertinent part:\n\nConsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy...\n\n54.\n\nIn consenting to the Centre's jurisdiction, the Claimants have expressly reserved any rights they may have to pursue enforcement of the ICC award rendered on February 16, 1983. Thus, the letter of August 15, 1983, from SPP(ME) to the Minister of Tourism quoted earlier (paragraph 40) states that the Claimants consider themselves free to take all steps necessary to ensure compliance with the ICC award, and that their consent to ICSID jurisdiction did not constitute a waiver of any rights they may have to seek recognition and enforcement of the ICC award by judicial proceedings. Similarly, the Request for Arbitration received by the Centre on August 24, 1984, states:\n\nWithout waiving any other remedy, SPP(ME) hereby elects to pursue the remedies for the settlement of investment disputes provided by the reference of Law No. 43 to the ICSID remedy in the absence of a specific agreement between the parties for the settlement of disputes.\n\n55.\n\nEgypt argues that, for jurisdiction of the Centre to exist, there must be a \"meeting of the minds\" to that effect, which is expressed in writing in unequivocal terms, and which necessarily excludes recourse to any other remedy. According to Egypt, the alleged consent of the Claimants to the Centre's jurisdiction is both invalid and non-existent, invalid because it contravenes the \"exclusive remedy\" requirement of Article 26. and non-existent because it contains an inherent self-contradiction and therefore lacks the \"certainty\" required to establish jurisdiction. According to Egypt, the provision of Article 26 that consent to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction \"shall be deemed consent... to the exclusion of any other remedy\" precludes a party from consenting to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and at the same time reserving the right to pursue other remedies. Since the Claimants have expressly reserved the right to pursue enforcement of the ICC award, their consent to ICSID jurisdiction is, in Egypt's view, in violation of Article 26 and therefore a nullity.\n\n56.\n\nMoreover, argues Egypt, the Claimants' alleged consent is illusory and, in fact, non-existent, since the Claimants, while purporting to accept the jurisdiction of the Centre, repudiate a prescribed condition of such acceptance, namely, the waiver of all other remedies.\n\n57.\n\nFor their part, the Claimants have argued that neither the Convention nor Law No. 43 requires any special form of consent, and that Article 26 does not establish an exclusive remedy rule but merely states the effect of consent expressed without reservation of other remedies.\n\n58.\n\nFrom a purely syntactical point of view, Article 26 does not say that consent to the Centre's jurisdiction will be vitiated if the consenting party does not exclude all other remedies. Rather, it is the other way around: Article 26 says that consent to ICSID jurisdiction, unless otherwise stated, shall be deemed to exclude other remedies. Thus, failure to waive other remedies does not impair consent to ICSID jurisdiction. Further, the provison \"unless otherwise stated\" may allow a party to consent to ICSID jurisdiction without waiving other remedies.\n\n59.\n\nThese conclusions are confirmed by the *travaux preparatoires.* The comments to the draft articles which ultimately became Article 26 state specifically that a party in consenting to the jurisdiction of the Centre may reserve the right to pursue other remedies. (*Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention, 19* 68, Vol. II, pp. 23. 219-20.) Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Article 26 does not bar the claim in the present case.\n\n60.\n\nIn connection with this first objection concerning the validity of the Claimants\u2019 consent. Egypt also argues that the Claimants' pursuit of an alternative remedy is inconsistent with Law No. 43, the first paragraph of Article 8 of Law No. 43 refers to three alternative forms of dispute resolution: resolution pursuant to any method of settlement agreed to by the parties themselves; resolution pursuant to the terms of any applicable bilateral treaty between Egypt and the State of which the investor is a national; and resolution within the framework of the ICSID Convention if the Convention is applicable. Egypt, while maintaining that Law No. 43 does not by itself establish ICSID jurisdiction without a separate agreement, argues that the three remedies mentioned in the first paragraph of Law No. 43 are mutually exclusive.\n\n61.\n\nIn principle the Tribunal agrees with this interpretation of Law No. 43, the Claimants are not entitled to both an ICC remedy and an ICSID remedy. So long as the arbitral and judicial processes do not produce more than one enforceable remedy, however, it matters not how many different paths are pursued in an effort to obtain that remedy, therefore, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants' pursuit of alternative remedies is not inconsistent with Law No. 43.\n\n62.\n\nEgypt also contends that Claimants\u2019 consent to ICSID jurisdiction is invalid because it contravenes general principles of international law. Specifically. Egypt argues that there is a general principle of international law, found also in most national laws, which forbids self-contradiction to the prejudice of another. According to Egypt, the self-contradiction in the present case results from the Claimants\u2019 concomitant pursuit of both an ICC remedy and an ICSID remedy; the damage results from the fact that Egypt must defend itself in two different proceedings, and could be subject to duplicate awards.\n\n63.\n\nIt is true that international tribunals have on occasion applied the principle of estoppel. However, this principle has no application in the present case to the question of the Claimants\u2019 consent to jurisdiction, there is in this case no inconsistency in pursuing alternative remedies, nor does it appear to the Tribunal that the Claimants, in so doing, are in any way acting contrary to good faith, the Claimants are trying to find a competent forum in which to adjudicate their claim for compensation for the expropriation of their investment.\n\n64.\n\nAs its second principal objection to the Centre's jurisdiction. Egypt maintains that Law No. 43 is not applicable in the present case. In this respect, Egypt has argued that whatever rights may have been conferred upon the Claimants by Law No. 43 were extinguished when approval of the Pyramids Oasis project was withdrawn by the General Organization for Investment on May 28, 1978. before SPP(ME) accepted the Centre's jurisdiction in its letter of August 15, 1983. In advancing this argument. Egypt has relied upon Article 1 of Law No. 43 which provides:\n\nThe term \"project\" in the application of the provisions of this Law shall mean any activity included within any of the spheres therein specified and approved by the Board of Directors of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones.\n\nIn Egypt's view, since Article 1 makes the approval of a project by the General Organization for Investment a condition to the enjoyment of rights under Law No. 43, the withdrawal of such approval necessarily entails inapplicability of the Law.\n\n65.\n\nAccording to Egyptian law, however, the decisions of the General Organization for Investment concerning the approval of projects are final. Article 23 of the Decree No. 375, which implemented Law No. 43, provides:\n\nThe decision of the Board of Directors shall be considered final as to applications submitted to the Authority...\n\nThere are only two exceptions to this rule of finality. Article 27 of Law No. 43 provides\n\n... Such approval shall lapse if the investor shall fail to take serious steps to carry out the project within six months of approval, unless the Board shall grant renewed approval for such further period as it shall deem fit.\n\nAnd Article 24 of Decree No. 375 provides:\n\n... Any failure of a project to abide by the conditions and objectives of its approval shall be submitted to the Board of Directors.\n\nConsequently, the General Organization for Investment has no competence to reconsider a previous approval of a project, unless one of the exceptions provided for in Article 23 of Law No. 43 or Article 24 of Decree No. 375 is applicable. Nor does the General Organization for Investment have competence to alter or infringe any acquired right that an approved project has to benefit from Law No. 43. This conclusion is confirmed by the terms of Article 6 of Law' No. 43. which provides:\n\nIrrespective of the nationality or domicile of their owners, projects in the Arab Republic of Egypt approved under the provisions of this Law shall enjoy the guarantees and privileges set forth in this law...\n\nThe decision of the General Organization for Investment of May 28, 1978, therefore exceeded the capacity of that authority and has no juridical effect, by itself, as to the legal status of an approved project.\n\n66.\n\nIn any event, the same conclusion results from general principles of law. Even without going into the question of the autonomy of an arbitration clause, the Tribunal notes that Egypt did not repeal Law No. 43 before the Claimants formally invoked ICSID jurisdiction, and indeed has still not repealed it. If Law No. 43 contained an offer by Egypt to accept ICSID jurisdiction prior to cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis project, that offer did not terminate as a result of the withdrawal of the approval of the project. For cancellation of the project did not alter the fact that an investment had been made under Law 43. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Law No. 43 is applicable to the investment dispute in the present case.\n\n67.\n\nAnother objection to the jurisdiction of the Centre relating to the applicability of Law No. 43 which has been raised by Egypt is that Article 8 of Law' No. 43. on which the Claimants rely to establish jurisdiction, is not applicable to the present dispute. Article 8 begins with the phrase:\n\nInvestment disputes in respect of the implementation of the provisions of this Law shall be settled...\n\nEgypt construes this phrase to restrict the application of Article 8 to disputes concerning the non-performance of obligations under Law No. 43. as distinct from disputes involving non-performance of obligations under a contract. In support of its construction of Article 8. Egypt cites the July 12, 1984, Decision of the Paris Court of Appeals, wherein the Court said that Article 8:\n\n*... ne vise, an surplus, que les seules contestations ayant trait a l'investissement et concernent la mise en execution des dispositions de la loi en cause, mais non celles de tel ou tel contrat.*\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal has some difficulty in accepting the above distinction as applying to all contracts and agreements, even those entered into by the Government itself. However, it is not necessary, for the purposes of the present decision, to address this question, since Egypt's objection may be simply answered by a recapitulation of certain facts, established earlier (paragraphs 16 to 35), namely:\n\n(a) The Government of Egypt was a party to the Heads of Agreement of September 1974, the preamble of which stated that it was concluded in accordance with Law No. 43.\n\n(b) The Heads of Agreement provided (i) for the incorporation of a joint venture between EGOTH and SPP: (ii) that Egypt would secure the title to property and possession of land required for the projects: and (iii) that the Government and EGOTH would transfer the right of usufruct to the joint venture.\n\n(c) On May 22, 1975. Presidential Decree No. 475 specified the use of the lands on Pyramids site for tourist purposes and authorised EGOTH either alone or with one of the companies in which it was in partnership to develop and use this site.\n\n(d) The right of usufruct was later irrevocably transferred to the joint venture incorporated between EGOTH and SPP(ME).\n\n(e) This right of usufruct was expropriated by the decree of the Ministry of Culture, on May 27, 1978. for reasons of public utility.\n\n(f) On June 19, 1978, Presidential Decree No. 475 of 1975 was cancelled.\n\nNo evidence has been produced in the proceedings that monetary compensation for the alleged expropriation of the Claimants\u2019 investment has been offered or even suggested.\n\n69.\n\nIn view of these facts, it is the Tribunal's opinion that, in the present case, the alleged breach by the Government of Egypt of the contractual obligations emanating from the Heads of Agreement constitutes at the same time a breach of a legal provision enunciated in Article 7 of Law No. 43. which the Government is bound to implement and respect. Article 7 provides that:\n\nProjects may not be nationalized or confiscated, the assets of such projects cannot be seized, blocked, confiscated or sequestered except by judicial procedures.\n\nIn this respect, it is quite clear that expropriation, the legitimacy of which is not being contested, if not accompanied by fair compensation, amounts to a confiscation, which is prohibited by Law No. 43, the present dispute, thus, is within the scope of Article 8. since it concerns \"the implementation of the provisions of this law\", namely, the protection from any measure of. or amounting to. nationalization or confiscation.\n\n70.\n\nEgypt's third major objection to jurisdiction in this case focuses on the operative effect of Law No. 43. Egypt argues that, even if Law No. 43 applies to the present investment dispute. Article 8 is not self-executing and therefore cannot confer a right to an ICSID remedy without a separate implementing agreement between the Government of Egypt and the foreign investor. Article 8 provides in relevant part:\n\nInvestment disputes in respect of the implementation of the provisions of this Law shall be settled in a manner to be agreed upon with the investor, or within the framework of the agreements in force between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the investor\u2019s home country, or within the framework of the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between the State and the nationals of other countries to which Egypt has adhered by virtue of Law No. 90 of 1971, where such Convention applies.\n\nDisputes may be settled through arbitration. An Arbitration Board shall be constituted, comprising a member on behalf of each disputing party and a third member acting as chairman to be jointly named by the same two members. Failing agreement on the nomination of the third member within thirty days of the appointment of the second member, the chairman shall be chosen, at the request of either party, by the Supreme Council of Judicial Bodies from among counsellors of the judiciary in the Arab Republic of Egypt...\n\nThis text is the one resulting from the rectification made by the Secretary-General, referred to earlier (paragraph 3), the Parties have accepted this translation with reservations which are not relevant to the present decision and which will be deal: with by the Tribunal, at a later stage, if necessary.\n\n71.\n\nIn Egypt's view. Law No. 43 offers investors four alternative methods of dispute settlement among which they may choose, SPP had the right, argues Egypt, to specify in the Heads of Agreement any of the methods mentioned in Law No. 43 which were applicable. Instead of doing so. SPP limited itself to referring in the Heads of Agreement only to the law itself.\n\n72.\n\nEgypt's principal contention concerning the effect of Law No. 43 is that it is too ambiguous and equivocal to establish consent to ICSID arbitration According to Egypt, such consent must be \"certain and unequivocal.\" because consent of a State to ICSID jurisdiction entails a waiver of sovereign immunity which itself requires a clear and unequivocal intent.\n\n73.\n\nEgypt argues further that a number of other factors support the conclusion that Law No. 43 is not self-executing. First. Egypt argues that virtually even national investment law which makes reference to ICSID arbitration expressly requires a separate agreement for the submission of disputes to the Centre's jurisdiction. Next. Egypt points out that neither Law No. 43 nor Decree No. 375 refers to ICSID arbitration. Rather. Law No. 43 refers to dispute settlement \"within the framework of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes,\" and Decree No. 375 refers to dispute settlement \"in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes\". Since the Convention provides for both arbitration and conciliation, the language used in Law No. 43 and Decree No. 375 is not sufficiently specific to establish consent to arbitration, according to Egypt. Egypt then contends that the phrase \"where the Convention applies\" at the end of the first paragraph of Article 8 is further evidence that Article 8 is not self-executing. For the Convention to apply, argues Egypt, there must be a separate undertaking. Finally. Egypt argues that the Claimants\\* conduct in pursuing an ICC remedy is further proof that Law No. 43 does not constitute an \"offer\" by Egypt to accept ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants view Law No. 43 somewhat differently. In their opinion, the statute states unequivocally and in mandatory terms that investment disputes shall be settled in one of three different ways, and that the option of domestic arbitration becomes available only if none of the three methods specified in the first paragraph of Article 8 is applicable, the Claimants argue that the statute means just what is says: investment disputes shall be settled in a manner to be agreed upon by the investor and the Government, or in the manner prescribed by any applicable bilateral treaty, or by reference to ICSID. if the Convention is applicable to the investment in question, the Claimants contrast the word \"shall\" in the first paragraph of Article 8 with the word \"may\" in the second paragraph, and argue that \"shall\" indicates a mandatory effect, while \"may\" indicates an optional effect. Only if there is no agreement between the parties on a form of dispute settlement, and there is no applicable bilateral treaty in force, and ICSID arbitration is not available because the Convention is not applicable to the investment in question, do the parties have the option of using domestic arbitration.\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 argument necessarily assumes a hierarchical relationship between the three methods of dispute settlement provided for in the first paragraph of Article 8, the Claimants contend that if this relationship is not clear on the face of Article 8. Decree No. 375, which implements Law' No. 43. leaves no doubt as to its existence. Article 45 of Decree 375 provides:\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article 8 of Law 43. investment disputes shall be settled pursuant to the rules and procedures agreed upon with the investor. In the absence of such agreement, such disputes shall be resolved according to rules established by agreements in force between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the investor's home country. If in turn there are no such agreements, disputes between the State and the nationals of other countries are to be settled in accordance with the provisions of the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, to which the Arab Republic of Egypt has adhered pursuant to Law No. 90 of 1971.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the words and the syntax of Article 45 lead one ineluctably to the conclusion that there is a hierarchical relationship between the three methods of dispute resolution. In the Claimants' view, the phrase \"in the absence of such agreement\" clearly refers to an agreement between the parties on the method of dispute resolution. Consequently, investment disputes may be resolved in accordance with any applicable bilateral treaty in force between Egypt and the investor\u2019s State only if the parties have not agreed on some other form of dispute resolution. If the parties have not so agreed, and if an applicable treaty is in force, then the dispute must be settled by the method provided for in the treaty. Similarly, the phrase \"If in turn there are no such agreements\" refers to an agreement between the parties or an agreement between Egypt and the investor's State. Thus, investment disputes may be resolved by ICSID arbitration only if the parties have not agreed on some other form of dispute resolution and there is no applicable bilateral agreement in force between Egypt and the investor\u2019s State. In such event, the Claimants argue, if the Convention applies to the investment in question, resort to ICSID is mandatory.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants also point out that if a separate agreement were required under Law No. 43 to refer a dispute to ICSID. as Egypt contends, such an agreement would be subsumed in the first method of dispute resolution provided for in Article 8. i.e., agreement between the parties. In such case, the reference to ICSID in Article 8 would be superfluous. If reference to ICSID arbitration is to mean anything at all. argue the Claimants, it must mean that disputes shall be submitted to ICSID in the absence of an agreement otherwise, provided the Convention is applicable to the investment.\n\n77.\n\nIf, as the Claimants contend Law No. 43 confers a right on foreign investors to invoke ICSID jurisdiction in cases where no other form of dispute resolution has been agreed to, the Claimants are entitled to maintain their case on the merits against Egypt before this Tribunal. If, on the other hand, Law No. 43 does no more than specify the various options which are available to foreign investors for use in investment agreements, as argued by Egypt, then the Tribunal lacks competence to hear the present case.\n\n78.\n\nThus, the determinative question as to the Tribunal's competence in the present case is the following: does Law No. 43 constitute a self-executing offer by Egypt to accept the Centre's jurisdiction with respect to the present dispute? This question is an important one, but it is a question that the Tribunal does not reach today, for at the threshold it encounters another question, to wit: whether the parties have agreed on some other form of dispute resolution? If they did, then, even on the Claimants' theory of the case, this Tribunal is not competent with respect to the present dispute. As the Claimants, themselves, have recognized:\n\n... a prerequisite to the submission of an investment dispute between the Government and a foreign investor to ICSID arbitration is that the parties failed to agree upon another means of dispute resolution.\n\n79.\n\nConsequently, the question of whether the Parties have agreed on another method of dispute resolution is a *question prealable* to a finding of jurisdiction by this Tribunal. In other words, before pronouncing on whether or not there consent to ICSID jurisdiction in the present case it must be established that the parties have not effectively agreed upon another \"manner\" of settling their investment dispute.\n\n80.\n\nThe existence or non-existence of a compromissory clause binding the parties to ICC arbitration is a mixed question of fact and law that requires a judicial decision. This type of question is described in continental legal systems as one of *\"qualification juridique des faits\".* This *qualification* cannot be affected by the Claimants' statements, made during the course of the proceedings, to the effect that, upon a finding by this Tribunal of jurisdiction, they are prepared to suspend their appeal to the Court of Cassation or stipulate that they will abandon any ICC remedy.\n\n81.\n\nThe question of whether the Parties have agreed on another method of dispute resolution is one which this Tribunal, as judge of its own jurisdiction, certainly has competence to resolve. However, the same question is also *sub judice* in another forum, where the proceedings involve the same Parties and the same dispute, the ICC tribunal has already answered this question in the affirmative, holding that Egypt and the Claimants agreed to resolve any disputes by ICC arbitration, the Paris Court of Appeals disagreed, but its decision has been appealed to the Court of Cassation, which will pronounce the final answer of the French judiciary on the matter.\n\n82.\n\nThus, we are confronted with the possibility that the above-referenced *question prealable* in the present case may be answered differently by two entirely separate and independent tribunals. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that both Parties are advancing inconsistent contentions before this Tribunal and before the French courts. Thus, the possibility arises that concurrent jurisdiction might be exercised with respect to the same Parties, the same facts and the same cause of action by two different arbitral tribunals.\n\n83.\n\nWhile the concurrent pursuit of a remedy in different jurisdictions might be justified to protect legitimate interests of a claimant, it nevertheless entails certain practical problems of international judicial administration, since it invites a clash between competing exercises of jurisdiction. This may result, not only in the concurrent exercise of jurisdiction by different tribunals, but also in a tribunal declining jurisdiction on the assumption, which later proves invalid, that another tribunal was the competent one to deal with the case.\n\n84.\n\nWhen the jurisdictions of two unrelated and independent tribunals extend to the same dispute, there is no rule of international law which prevents either tribunal from exercising its jurisdiction. However, in the interest of international judicial order, either of the tribunals may. in its discretion and as a matter of comity, decide to stay the exercise of its jurisdiction pending a decision by the other tribunal.\n\n85.\n\nThe law and the courts of the country where a tribunal sits are generally recognized as the proper law and the proper courts to pronounce on the validity and scope *ratione personae* of an arbitration clause. Thus, establishing that arbitration should take place in Paris, those who concluded or approved the December Agreement subjected themselves by their own accord to French law and French courts for the determination of the validity and the scope *ratione personae* of the ICC arbitration clause.\n\n86.\n\nMoreover, if the present proceedings on jurisdiction were stayed until such time as the question of ICC jurisdiction has been finally resolved by the French courts, such a stay would not appear to seriously disadvantage either Party.\n\n87.\n\nEvery court has inherent powers to stay proceedings when justice so requires, and this Tribunal\u2019s discretion to do so is established by Article 44 of the Convention.\n\n88.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth above.\n\nTHE TRIBUNAL UNANIMOUSLY DECIDES:\n\nA. To reject the objections to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent alleging that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, as well as the pursuit by the Claimants of alternative remedies, bar the claim in the present case:\n\nB. To reject the objection to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent alleging the withdrawal from the Claimant of the benefits of Law No. 43;\n\nC. To reject the objection to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent contending that the provisions of Article 8 of Law No. 43 do not apply to this investment dispute: and\n\nD. To stay the present proceedings on the Respondent\u2019s remaining objections to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction until the proceedings of the French courts have finally resolved the question of whether the Parties agreed to submit their dispute to the jurisdiction of the International Chamber of Commerce."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "1988-04-14T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Mohamed El Mahdi", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Mohamed El Mahdi\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe present dissenting opinion is divided into two parts : the first part contains the main arguments in answer to whether or not the Claimants have standing to invoke ICSID jurisdiction and the Tribunal's competence over the present case on the basis of the provisions of article (8) of the Egyptian Law N\u00b0 43 of the year 1974. The second part deals with comments and observations formulated in response to the draft adopted by the other eminent two members of the Tribunal.\n\nFIRST PART - Do the Claimants have standing to invoke ICSID jurisdiction and this Tribunal's competence over the present case?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe main argument regarding ICSID's jurisdiction and this Tribunal's competence over the present case is based on the contention that the two Parties to the dispute, i.e. (SPP group and Egypt) gave their consent in writing to ICSID arbitral jurisdiction:\n\na. Egypt by enacting Law 43/1974, Article 8 of which provides in relevant part as follows:\n\nInvestment disputes in respect of the implementation of the provisions of this Law shall be settled in a manner to be agreed upon with the investor, or within the framework of the agreements in force between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the investor's home country, or within the framework of the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between the State and the nationals of other countries to which Egypt has adhered by virtue of Law No 90 of 1971, where such Convention applies.\n\nDisputes may be settled through arbitration. An arbitration board shall be constituted comprising a member on behalf of each disputing party and a third member acting as chairman to be jointly named by the said two members. Failing agreement on the nomination of the third member within thirty days of the appointment of the second member, the chairman shall be chosen, at the request of either party, by the Supreme Council of Judicial Bodies from among counsellors of the Judiciary in the Arab Republic of Egypt...\"\n\n(The above text is mentioned in the Preliminary Decision of this Tribunal of November 27, 1985, para 70, after being rectified by Secretary General of ICSID who notified the Parties i.e., SPP (M.E.) and Egypt, by telex of August 29, 1984, on the occasion of the registration of the request to arbitration that :\n\n...the Arabic text of Article 8 of Law 43 of 1974 refers to the settlement of disputes within the framework of ICSID Convention in the cases where it (i.e. the Convention) applies, and not, as erroneously mentioned in the English translation, where Law 90 of 1971 ratifying the Convention applies. I have thus registered the request of SPP without prejudice to the question whether said article eight constitutes consent for the purposes of the ICSID Convention or merely includes a reference to this Convention in the cases where consent for ICSID jurisdiction is issued separately. This matter if raised, will be for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide).\n\nIt is to be noted, however, that the Claimants in their memorial of May 20, 1987 (p. 32) submitted that \"it is proper to rely on the English text disseminated by the A.R.E. itself.\"\n\nb. And the Claimants by the letter of SPP (M.E.) dated August 15, 1983, notified to the Minister of Tourism of Egypt which states that:\n\n..Recognizing that your Government has taken the position that the ICC award was rendered without a jurisdictional basis, we hereby notify you that we accept and reserve the opportunity of availing ourselves of the uncontestable jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, under the auspices of the World Bank, which is opened to us as a result of Law N\u00b0 43 of 1974, Article 8 of which provided that investment disputes may be settled by ICSID arbitration.\n\nand again the filing by SPP (ME) of the request for arbitration to ICSID on August 24, 1984.\n\n2.\n\nIn support to this contention, the Claimants, in substance, advance various series of arguments:\n\na. That the consent to ICSID is to be governed by international Law applicable to international treaties, and that no international Law principle requires that the wording allegedly containing Egypt's consent should be construed restrictively. Consequently, that the ICSID Convention should be interpreted in view of its purpose and objectives, and that a government's consent to submit disputes to an international tribunal is subject to the same rules of interpretation as ordinary contractual obligations.\n\nb. That Article 8 of Law 43/1974 is self-executing. In this respect, Claimants assert that the acceptance of ICSID Jurisdiction over the \"settlement\" of disputes can only mean the acceptance of arbitration as a mode of settlement to the exclusion of the other settlement mechanism provided for by the Convention which is conciliation, particularly when taking into consideration that the first paragraph of Article 8 of the said Law is mandatory.\n\nc. Furthermore, since negotiations with the A.R.E. took place in English only, and the Heads of Agreement were drafted in English alone, the Claimants assert that they are entitled to rely upon the English translation of the text of Law published by A.R.E., as well as upon the official publications addressed by the A.R.E. to foreign investors, thereby concluding that it cannot be admitted to take into consideration Egypt's argument that the verb used in the Arabic text of Article 8 has some floating significance which only a hypersensitive scholar might appreciate. Claimants then affirm that it cannot be accepted that everything not in Arabic the A.R.E. published with respect to its investment regime is clouded by an unstated caveat lector whereby the A.R.E. may at any time contradict anything stated therein on the basis of its own unilateral interpretation of the Arabic text; in that case, Claimants say, good faith would require that Egypt says so before investments are made. Claimants also assert that, even on the basis of the original Arabic text of Article 8, their contention is well based; suffices to consider the comparison of the two verbs used in the first and the second paragraph of Article 8 itself.\n\nd. Claimants also advance that Article 8 of Law No 43 should be construed in the light of the general legislative purpose of Law N\u00b0 43, and that it should not be interpreted so as to render its clause (3) redundant. Claimants further assert that by applying the principle of the \"effet utile\" one comes to the conclusion that Article 8 should have meant the expression of Egypt's consent to arbitration under the convention. Such submission is confirmed by the investment literature issued by the General Authority of Investment and Free Zones as well as by the historical context of Egypt's adherence to the Washington Convention and the enactment of Foreign Investment Law N\u00b0 43/1974.\n\n3.\n\nThe main objections to the Jurisdiction advanced by the Respondent, concerning the correct interpretation of Article 8 of Law N\u00b0 43/1974 can be summarized as follows :\n\na. The interpretation of the investment promotion Law N\u00b0 43/1974, and consequently of Article 8 of said Law must be conducted in light of the historical background of Egypt's suffering and struggle for the abolition of the capitular regime which was the manifestation of the most serious strain upon Egypt's sovereignty.\n\nb. That the denial of the application of Law N\u00b0 43/1974, as such, and consequently of its Article 8 contravenes Article 42 of the Washington Conyention.\n\nc. That the only text susceptible to produce any legal effect is the Arabic text of Law 43/1974, which uses the present tense and that it is not permitted to induce an element of internationalization or to conclude to a finding of an imaginary intention of the Law that does not exist.\n\nd. That for the interpretation of Law 43/1974, it must-be borne in mind that Article 2 of the Law issuing Law N\u00b0 43 provides that \"Matters not covered by this Law are subject to the applicable Laws and regulations\", and that the Arabic text of Article 8 of Law 43/1974 contains nothing of a mandatory effect, but simply enunciates the available methods of settlement of investment deputes to be agreed upon between the investor and Egypt. On the one hand because a linguistic study of the verb used in the Arabic text of the first paragraph of Article 8 proves that the verb cannot be correctly translated into the English mandatory verb \"shall\" and on the other hand because the second paragraph of said Article 8 is not to be disassociated from the first paragraph since the second paragraph begins with \"and\",conse-peut \u00e9galement, ou en outre Ton peut...\" thereby confirming the facultative nature of the provisions of Article 8 (Egypt's memorial in reply to the oral arguments of the Claimants expressed in the session of September 8, 1987, p. 12). Egypt also points out that the language of Article 45 of Law N\u00b0 43 which states : \"l'on peut convenir de r\u00e9gler par arbitrage les litiges qui surgissent entre les projets \u00e9tablis dans les zones franches ou entre ceux-ci et l'organisme ou autres autorit\u00e9s et organes administratifs ayant rapport avec les activit\u00e9s exerc\u00e9es dans la zone combined with the language of Article 8 confirms the conclusion that the legislator's intention is simply to indicate the possible procedures for the settlement of investment disputes, and for Egypt to advance that :\n\n\"Il devient impossible d'all\u00e9guer ou pr\u00e9tendre que les deux ordres de disposition du deuxi\u00e8me alin\u00e9a de l'article 8 et de l'article 45 n'ouvrent pas aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00e9liminer par leur accord propre toutes les alternatives donn\u00e9es par le premier alin\u00e9a de l'article 8.\" (The above mentioned Egypt's memorial p. 13).\n\nTo the conclusion that :\n\n\"Ainsi le tout revient \u00e0 un choix que les parties font en connaissance de cause.\"\n\nThis conclusion, asserts Egypt, is in accord with: the framework of the Washington Convention explicitly mentioned in Article 8 and the necessity of a separate agreement to ICSID jurisdiction as stated in the explanatory note accompanying Law N\u00b0 90/1971 by which Egypt ratified the Convention, the said explanatory note containing that :\n\n\"L'introduction des litiges par devant cet organisme (le CIRDI) n'est point obligatoire, mais rel\u00e8ve du consentement explicite \u00e9crit de l'Etat et de l'investisseur.\"\n\ne. Egypt also advances that the phrase in fine of paragraph 1 of Article 8 which says \"where such Convention applies\" is relevant to the effect that the applicability of the Convention is conditional upon the presence of certain prerequisites, inter alia and most importantly, the consent of the Parties to this effect. Furthermore, Egypt asserts that Article 45 of the executive statute of Law 43/74 (the executive statute issued by decree N\u00b0 375 of 1977 of the Minister of Economy) states that \"sans prejudice des dispositions de Particle 8 de la loi...\" and not as erroneously translated to \"In accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Law N\u00b0 43...\" and that the executive statute cannot have the effect, eventually, to add to the provisions of Law 43/74, to the conclusion that if Law 43/74 does not contain Egypt's consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID, the statute, consequently, cannot have this effect.\n\n4.\n\nIn my opinion, the issue of jurisdiction, in the present case, is to be determined by the answer to two major questions :\n\na. Which law is applicable to the finding of whether Egypt did or did not consent to. ICSID jurisdiction, and more precisely to the settlement of the present case by arbitration under the auspices of ICSID ?\n\nb. Which text is to be considered for the purpose of determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction ? Is it the text of the Law in its original language or the translation into another language, and in case of more than one translation which version should prevail ? In other terms, what are the requirements deemed necessary for a translation to be considered as a basis of a state\u2019s declared intention in the matter of consent to ICSID jurisdiction ?\n\n5.\n\nEgypt has no point in stating that its historical evolution and specifically the burden of the capitulary regime has to be taken into consideration in the interpretation of its modern laws and statutes. Egypt is a sovereign State, signatory of the Charter of the United Nations at San Francisco on June 26, 1945, and since the creation of the United Nations, enjoys the same prerogatives as all other sovereign member States, In exercising its legislative power, Egypt acts as a modern sovereign State; hence, the far or near past of the historical evolution has no impact in this respect. Moreover, Egypt is not only a signatory State to the Washington Convention, but also the siege of a regional commercial arbitration Centre created pursuant to a resolution to this effect by the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee on January 1978 (M. Davis-Business Law in Egypt 1984 p. 138), and ICSID concluded with that Centre an accord in application of Article 63 of the Convention. (G. Delaume, Le Centre International pour le Reglement des differends relatifs aux investements (CIRDl)).\n\n6.\n\nIt has to be noted that the present Tribunal has been always aware of the importance of the consent of the parties to the dispute as a condition of Jurisdiction of ICSID. In its preliminary decision of November 27, 1985, after reviewing pertinent parts of the Preamble of the Convention and the report of the Executive Directors on the Convention, the Tribunal emphasized the consent as the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre by stating that ascertaining the existence of the consent \"is a task that this Tribunal must approach with great care.' (Paragraph 51 of the Preliminary Decision.)\n\n7.\n\nIt is true, as mentioned in said preliminary decision, that the Convention does not prescribe any particular form for the consent required to establish the Centre's jurisdiction other than that being \"in writing\". As made clear in the Report of the Executive Directors,a host State may in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes arising out of certain classes of investment to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and the investor may give his consent by accepting the offer in writing.\n\n8.\n\nNeedless to point out that an Arbitral Tribunal operating under the auspices of ICSID has to take into account the convention, both in its language and spirit. In the case AMCO ASIA vs the Republic of Indonesia (Award on jurisdiction), it was indicated that according to the very first sentence of the Convention's Preamble ICSID arbitration is a method of settlement which corresponds to the interests, not only of investors, but of the Contracting States as well. In other terms, the Convention is aimed to protect to the same extent and with the same vigor the investor and the host State. However, such correct and accurate statement does not, and indeed cannot, be the basis of an assumption of ICSID jurisdiction. The language of the Convention is explicit: there must be a consent in writing (Article 25/1) and that \"any contracting State may, at the time of ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention or at any time thereafter, notify the Centre of the class or classes of disputes which it would or would not consider submitting to the jurisdiction of the Centre... Such notification shall not constitute the consent required by paragraph (1)\" (Article 25/4). In the light of the above mentioned considerations, one may conclude that it is in the mutual benefit of an investor and a host State to submit investment disputes to ICSID jurisdiction, but one should also conclude that in accordance with the language and spirit of the Convention and the subtle combination of the needs of capital exporting and importing countries agreed upon and embodied in the Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre does not and cannot exceed the limits traced by the Convention allowing the Centre to become the Juge de Droit Commun of investment disputes on the assumption of a consent which does not exist in fact or in law.\n\n9.\n\nFor the establishment of the jurisdiction of the Centre, the Convention requires that the parties to the dispute consent to that jurisdiction in writing (Article 25 of the Convention). The Convention also necessitates that the request for either conciliation (Article 28/2) or arbitration (36/2) includes the parties' consent to the method of settlement they consented upon under ICSID jurisdiction. It is an obligation under the Convention (Articles 32/2 and 41/2) for the Conciliation Commission and the Arbitral Tribunal to rule upon any objection raised to the effect that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or is not within the competence of the Conciliation Commission or the Arbitral Tribunal. The conciliation commission and the arbitral tribunal are empowered on their own initiative under \"conciliation rules\" (rule 30/2) and \"Arbitration rules\" (rule 41/2) to consider at any stage of the proceeding whether the dispute before them is within the jurisdiction of the Centre or within the competence of either of them.\n\nThe Preamble of the Convention states that \"no contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\"\n\nThe Report of the Executive Directors explains that \"the term \"jurisdiction\" of the Centre is used as a convenient expression to mean the limits within which the provisions of the Convention will apply and the facilities of the Centre will be available for conciliation and arbitration proceedings\", and also states that, since the Convenion does not require that consent of both parties be expressed in a single instrument, \"thus a host State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes arising out of certain classes of investments to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the investor might give his consent by accepting the offer in writing.\" (paragraphs 22-24 of the Report).\n\nIn the same vein, it has been said that the drafters of the Convention have had recourse to the concept of \"jurisdiction of the Centre\" in spite of that the use of the term \"jurisdiction\" in relation to the Centre is admittedly open to objections on the purist ground, the Centre not being in any sense a court but merely an administrative body under whose auspices conciliation commissions or arbitral Tribunals may be established and proceedings conducted. (A. Broches, The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes : Some Observations on Jurisdiction, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, 1966, p. 265).\n\nAccordingly, in spite of the fact that under the Convention an institutional element is introduced which allows, through the mechanism of the Centre, the creation of a conciliation Commission or an arbitration Tribunal deriving their competence from the Convention itself, the fact remains that the \"jurisdiction\" conferred on the Centre is not to be considered as a jurisdiction de droit commun concerning all investment disputes. The whole system of jurisdiction is based upon the consent of the parties as to the jurisdiction indicating at the same time the method of settlement provided for by the Convention; whether conciliation or arbitration.\n\nConciliation and arbitration are considered according to the Convention as the two alternative methods of settlement of investment disputes among which the parties have to choose.\" Le Centre offre aux parties deux voies de r\u00e8glement, par la conciliation et par l'arbitrage,\" writes M, Anadio in \"Le contentieux international de l'investissement priv\u00e9 et la Convention de la banque mondiale du 18 mars 1965\", (Paris, LGDJ, 1967, p. 147). The author continued by clarifying that:\" une juridictionnalisation notable non seulement de l'arbitrage pour lequel d'ailleurs cette caract\u00e9ristique est aujourd'hui bien acquise mais aussi de la conciliation que la Convention veut rendre la plus efficace possible\" (emphasis added).\n\n10.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of the Convention the consent \"in writing\" to the jurisdiction of the Centre, should indicate unequivocally the method of settlement agreed upon i.e. whether the concerned party consents to conciliation or favours a direct recourse to arbitration.\n\n11.\n\nIn the light of the variety of the forms of consent admitted in the framework of the Convention, Professor Reuter explains that if the Convention is characterized by its flexibility as to the form in which consent can be expressed and embodied, the Convention \"reste cependant assez prudente sur la nature juridique du consentement ; il peut \u00eatre conventionnel et relever du droit national ou du droit international public; mais rien n'exclut \u00e0 priori que dans un syst\u00e8me juridique national d\u00e9termin\u00e9, il ne pr\u00e9sente aucun caract\u00e8re conventionnel et r\u00e9sulte d'un acte condition d'une part et d'un statut l\u00e9gal de l'autre. Il se pourrait que ces distinctions ne soient cependant pas sans importance, notamment dans le cas o\u00f9 la validit\u00e9 du consentement serait mise en cause: la d\u00e9termination du droit applicable et des causes d'invalidit\u00e9 pourrait varier d'un cas \u00e0 un autre.\" (Emphasis added) (Investissements \u00e9trangers et arbitrage entre Etats et personnes priv\u00e9es : P. Reuter, R\u00e9flexions sur la comp\u00e9tence du Centre, Paris, Pedone, 1969. p. 14)\n\n12.\n\nIn the present case, the alleged consent of Egypt, or rather and more precisely the alleged offer by Egypt to submit investment disputes to ICSID arbitration is contained in the Egyptian Investment Law N\u00b0 43 of the year 1974 (Article 8), the Claimants contend that they accepted this offer. Thus the nature juridique of the alleged consent to ICSID arbitration is one resulting from \"un acte condition d'une part et d'un statut l\u00e9gal de l'autre\" with the result that the applicable law to the consent is, in the present case, the Egyptian Investment Law, N\u00b0 43/1974. This is not an application of Article 42 of the Convention, as asserts Egypt, because that article deals with the applicable law to the subject matter of the dispute and provides that in the absence of an agreement to the contrary the law of the contracting State party to the dispute shall be applicable. In essence the applicability of Egypt's Law 43/74 as to the finding of whether or not Egypt offered to submit investment disputes to conciliation or to arbitration in implementation of the provisions of Law N\u00b0 43/74 derives from the nature juridique of the offer contained in said legislative text. The legal consequences of this basic reality can be summarized as follows:\n\na. The Egyptian Law N\u00b0 43/74 is to be applied, per se, to the finding by this Tribunal of jurisdiction. Precedents by international tribunals to the effect that municipal laws are to be considered as a mere fact, are not of any relevance to the present case.\n\nb. The international rules of interpretation of treaties codified in articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention of 1969 on the law of treaties cannot be applied mutatis mutandis to the interpretation of Egypt's Law N\u00b0 43/74. Such rules, are conceived as applicable to treaties and other contractually binding obligations governed by the fundamental rule of pacta sunt servanda. Contrarily, with regard to the interpretation of a teat of law, there is no place for a search of a common intention. Article (1) of the Egyptian Civil Code stipulates that \"Legislative provisions are applicable to all issues which are covered by these provisions, in teat and content.\" (The translation published by the Middle East Library for Economic Services, Cairo.)\n\n13.\n\nThe preliminary decision rendered by the present Arbitral Tribunal ordering suspension of the proceedings was based on the application of Law 43/74 and of Article 8 of that Law, as the law applicable to the determination of whether or not Egypt, by the effect of the said Law, gave a standing offer to submit investment disputes concerning the application of the provisions of the Law to ICSID arbitration. The decision in question clearly stated, \"thus, the determinative question as to the Tribunal's competence in the present case is the following : Does Law 43 constitute a self-executing offer by Egypt to accept the Centre's jurisdiction with respect to the present dispute ?\" By such formulation, the Tribunal rightfully referred to Egypt's Law 43 as the Law applicable to the finding of jurisdiction.\n\n14.\n\nIn this respect, two preliminary observations must be borne in mind :\n\na. That the Convention itself takes the utmost care to ensure that the consent is certain. For that purpose, Article 25 (4) of the Convention explicitly states that the notification by a State to the Centre that it would consider submitting certain disputes to the jurisdiction of the Centre does not constitute the consent required to the establishment of jurisdiction. Professor Reuter correctly observed that this provision reflects the necessity of the certainty of the consent by stating that: \"Ce double consentement doit \u00eatre certain; une simple d\u00e9claration d'intention ne saurait valoir consentement.\" (P. Reuter, R\u00e9flexions sur la comp\u00e9tence du Centre, op. cit. p. 14) It results that a declaration of an intention to submit certain investment disputes to the Centre's jurisdiction does not contravene, but in fact can be considered in accordance with the language and the spirit of the Convention.\n\nb. That it does not suffice to accept the Centre's jurisdiction, but the consent must also contain the choice of the method of settlement made and available under the Convention: i.e. conciliation or arbitration. Since the Convention provided for these two methods of settlement of investment disputes it is necessary, when expressing the consent to the jurisdiction, to specify the method of settlement agreed upon. The general idea that conciliation precedes normally arbitration, and that it is not a method of settlement because it concludes to recommendations not binding upon the parties, does not apply under the mechanism of the Convention. The Convention deals with both conciliation and arbitration as methods of dispute settlements and nowhere in the Convention, can one trace a provision to the effect that the acceptance or the consent to the Centre's jurisdiction is to be considered the equivalent of the consent to arbitration to the exclusion of conciliation or vice versa. Article 28 (2) of the Convention, concerning Conciliation, reads as follows: \"The request shall contain information concerning the issue in dispute... and their consent to conciliation...\", and article 36 (2) of the Convention, concerning arbitration states that \"The request shall contain information concerning the issue in dispute... and their consent to arbitration...\" It is legitimate, therefore, to conclude that the consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre must necessarily include the choice of the method of settlement agreed upon by the parties to the dispute whether it be conciliation or arbitration. This obligation emanates from the explicit language of both articles 28/2 and 36/2 of the convention.\n\n15.\n\nAs to the interpretation of a text of a. national law, the interpretation must, in principle, be undertaken on the basis of the original text of the law. It goes without saying that said text embodies the legal provision which has been meant to govern the envisaged situation. In the present case, the problem is that the text of the law is in Arabic, and not all the members of the Arbitral Tribunal do have sufficient knowledge of that language. It has to be noted that in the Amco Asia's case vs the Republic of Indonesia, the Arbitral Tribunal was faced with a similar linguistic problem, but the Tribunal did not find itself in need for calling upon experts sufficiently familiar with the Indonesian language. But in the present case, the Claimants initially asserted that they have the right to avail themselves of a certain English translation of the text of Law 43/74. Thereafter, the Claimants did not contest the rectification of the English translation of paragraph (1) in fine of Article (8) effectuated by the Secretary General of ICSID by his telex to the parties dated August 29, 1984 and referred to in paragraph (3) of the preliminary decision.\n\n16.\n\nThe divergence between the parties in the present case with regard to article (8) of Law 43/74, is limited to two points:\n\nI- Does the expression \"shall be settled\" correspond to the exact wording of the text in Arabic and\n\nII- what is the correct translation of the last phrase of the first paragraph of Article (8)? Should the translation be : \"where such law applies\" as it figures in the translation effectuated by the \"Arab and Foreign Investments and the Free Zones Authority\" (Annex 1 to the Claimants request for arbitration), or \"where such Convention applies\" (the translation as rectified by the Secretary General of ICSID referred to herein above), or \"in the case where such treaties and convention apply\" (according to the translation effectuated and qualified as the accurate translation by Mr. S. Saleh in his affidavit of Law - Claimants Exhibit N\u00b0 45). Mr. Saleh pointed out that \"the English version issued by the Egyptian authorities translates \"they apply\" by \"such law applies\" (i.e. Law N\u00b0 90 of 1971) instead of by \"they (such treaties and conventions) apply\". The verb in Arabic, however, is \"tasri\" which is in the plural and therefore strongly indicates that the translation \"such law applies\" is incorrect\". (Affidavit p. 2). That statement is further confirmed by the telex dated June 14, 1985 (Claimant's Exhibit 11) in which Mr. J.F. Rycx stated that \"I have read the Arabic record of Egyptian Law 43/1974. In our opinion, the verb \"tasri\" which is used at the end of the first paragraph of Article 8 clearly refers to treaties and Conventions.\" The verb has been put in the feminine singular. According to the established Arabic grammar, feminine singular is used for concordance when the subject in the plural denotes irrational or. inanimate objects. In this context, the verb \"tasri\" could not be related to the word \"law\" which in Arabic is masculine.\"\n\n17.\n\nIt appears from the above that the translation to English language effectuated by the \"Arab and Foreign Investments and the Free Zones Authority\" lacks precision. Setting aside, for the time being the exactitude of the translation of \"shall be settled\", it is beyond any doubt that the correct translation of the last phrase of paragraph 1 of Article (8) is not as it figures in the translation of the said Authority. The Affidavit of Mr. Saleh presented by the Claimants confirms this conclusion, since he asserted that paragraph 1 of Article (8) should read as follows : \"Investment disputes relating to the implementation of the provisions of this law shall be settled in a manner to be agreed upon with the investor, or within the framework of the treaties in force between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the investor's State or within the framework of the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and the Nationals of another State to which the Arab Republic of Egypt has adhered by Law No 90 of 1971, in the cases where they (such treaties and Convention) apply\" (emphasis added). -\n\n18.\n\nFor all the above stated reasons, we are of the opinion that the issue of the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the present Tribunal has to be decided upon on the basis of the text of Law N\u00b0 43/74 and not upon any other translation. The fact that said law contains the State's offer to submit certain disputes to ICSID's jurisdiction, cannot mean that a translation thereof in a foreign language may by itself have the same effect. The consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre necessitates a will and a clear intention to that effect, which includes the consent upon one or the other of the two methods of settlement of investment disputes provided for by the Convention. Moreover, it has to be noted that in the present case the only text enacted when the Claimants entered into their investment engagements in Egypt (September-December 1974) is the text of Law 43/74, in its original language. All English or other translation, as well as the issuance of the Executive Regulations, came into existence at a later date.\n\n19.\n\nSumming up, the last phrase of the first paragraph of Article (8) of Law 43/74 is beyond any doubt erroneously translated by the Arab and Foreign Investments and the Free Zones Authority (Claimants Exhibit 1), as admitted by both parties. Therefore, in our opinion, the present Tribunal cannot base its decision concerning jurisdiction upon that erroneous translation. Consequently, the Tribunal has, first, to consider the issue of jurisdiction on the basis that Article (8) of Law 43/74 reads as follows: \"Investment disputes relating to the implementation of the provisions of this law shall be settled in a manner to be agreed upon with the investor, or within the framework of the treaties in force between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Investor's State, or within the framework of the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and the Nationals of another State to which the Arab Republic of Egypt has adhered by Law N\u00b0 90 of 1971 in the cases where they (such treaties and Convention) apply..\n\nDisputes may be agreed to be settled by arbitration. An Arbitration Board shall be composed...\"\n\n20.\n\nAs a general rule of interpretation, a sentence that figures in a law or statute must be construed to have meaning and sense. The proviso which figures in fine in the first paragraph of Article (8), is not in conflict with that rule of interpretation.\n\nThe proviso in question has been added to indicate that the settlement within the framework of either bilateral treaties and the Washington Convention has to take place \"in the cases where they (such treaties and Conventions) apply\". This means in a clear language, and hence conveys the reasonable understanding according to which the conditions related to the application of the relevant bilateral treaty or of the Convention have to be satisfied. Needless to point out that the fundamental sine qua non condition for the Convention to apply is the consent of the parties to the jurisdiction of the Centre and to one or the other method of settlement provided for in the Convention, i.e., conciliation or arbitration. To conclude that it results from the language and the. reasonable interpretation of the said article that Egypt by enacting that law offered to submit the investment disputes to ICSID jurisdiction, and further to consent that the method of settlement of these disputes has to be arbitration to the exclusion of conciliation constitutes an unfounded speculation.\n\n21.\n\nThe proviso in fine of paragraph (1) of Article (8) is unconditional. To specify that it refers to conditions of the application of the Convention: other than consent, is a matter of speculation that has no basis from the plain and clear text of law 43/74. The Convention itself anticipated that a State may declare its intention to submit certain investment disputes to ICSID jurisdiction, and that the said declaration of intention is not to be considered consent to the jurisdiction to ICSID.\n\nReference in paragraph (1) of Article (8) to bilateral treaties, does not, and cannot be construed as acceptance to ICSID or to any other method of settlement, in case the bilateral treaty necessitates a separate consent to that effect. The same reasoning, as well, applies to the Convention, By enumerating in an investment law the methods of settlement available, such enumeration could not be construed to the effect of assuming an intention to submit unconditionally to all these methods. Such assumption would be in complete contradiction with the express proviso to the effect that these methods shalI apply in case the conditions of application are satisfied and in that case only. In other terms, the enumeration contained in paragraph (1) of Article (8) does not necessarily entail the State's consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID, and in particular to a given method (arbitration) under the auspices of ICSID.\n\nIt goes without saying that in case the conditions for the application of either bilateral treaties or the Convention are satisfied, the dispute must, or shall, be settled in the manner provided for by such a treaty or by the Convention. On the other hand, if the conditions and requirements are not satisfied, they cannot be applied and law 43/74 cannot have the effect of conferring consent to arbitration neither in the framework of the bilateral treaties nor in the framework of the Convention. Consequently, reference in article (8) of law 43/74, to both bilateral treaties and the Convention is not to be considered redundant with the eventual method of settlement that may be agreed upon with the investor since in this case the agreement is not limited to any particular form of settlement, neither concerning the procedures nor the law governing the subject matter. Only by acting accordingly, the Tribunal would not exceed its proper sphere of interpretation to infringe upon the domain of imperium which is the demain reserved to the legislator.\n\n22.\n\nThe French translation of article (8) of Law 43/74 published in the \"Bulletin du Centre de documentation d'\u00e9tudes juridiques, \u00e9conomiques et sociales\" (le Caire, 3\u00ebme ann\u00e9e N\u00b0 4, octobre 1976) and submitted to this Tribunal, reads as follows: \"Les contestations ayant trait \u00e0 l'investissement, et concernant la mise en ex\u00e9cution des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi, sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par le moyen convenu avec l'investisseur ou dans le cadre des conventions en vigueur entre Ta R.A.E. et l'Etat de l'investisseur, ou encore dans le cadre de la Convention de r\u00e8glement des contestations des investissements entre l'Etat et les citoyens des autres Etats, Convention \u00e0 laquelle a adh\u00e9r\u00e9 la R.A.E. en vertu de la loi N\u00b0 90 de 1971, et ce dans les cas o\u00f9 la dite Convention est applicable.\" (Egypt's exhibit 73).\n\nIn that translation, the expression \"shall be settled\" does not appear, instead is the expression \"sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9es\" meaning are settled, without the shadow of a doubt as to a mandatory significance. Can it be admitted that the issue of the jurisdiction of the Centre be based upon one or the other different translations with the consequence of an eventual different conclusion depending upon whether the party to the dispute is a French speaking investor supposedly relying upon a French translation or an English speaking investor relying upon an English translation ?\n\n23.\n\nSince the Tribunal is under the obligation to apply Law N\u00b0 43/74, it would have been necessary, for the Tribunal, to have recourse to linguistic expertise in the Arabic language. However, it seems that expertise is not necessary, in the present case, since the uncontested parts of the English translation of article (8) of Law 43, submitted by the Claimants, as well as the French translation, reveal, beyond any doubt, that reference to the Convention in article (8) is conditioned by the proviso: in case the Convention applies. The proper interpretation of paragraph (1) of article (8) of Law N\u00b0 43/1974 leads to consider the application of the Convention and hence the establishment of the Centre's jurisdiction subject to a special consent which is required by the proviso c onstrued to the effect that the settlement within the framework of the Convention is to take place only if and in case that the Convention applies; that is whenever the conditions of its application are satisfied i.e. inter alia that the parties to that particular dispute consent to the jurisdiction of the ICSID, be it arbitration or conciliation.\n\n24.\n\nMoreover, it has been explained, during the session of this Tribunal held in Paris on September 8, 1987, that the verb used in the Arabic text of article (8) translated to \"shall\" is \"tatim\", and the verb in Arabic does not contain the mandatory effect eventually attributed to \"shall\" in the English language. It has also been pointed out that the same verb, in the same tense is used in the Civil Code of Egypt, for example, as regards contracts to the effect that the contract is concluded \"yatim\" (yatim being the masculine form of the same verb and in the same tense of \"tatim\", since the contract in the Arabic language is masculine), and that no mandatory effect can reasonably be attributed to the use of the verb \"yatim\" since it would be aberrant to pretend that the legislator orders that the contract envisaged should be necessarily concluded. If the contract \"yatim\" is concluded in case the conditions set forth by law, to its conclusion, are complied with, in the same vein, the investment disputes \"tatim\" are settled by one or the other method provided for in article (8) of Law 43/74 in case its conditions of application are satisfied.\n\nIn effect, the usage of verb \"tatim\" in combination with the express proviso \"where such convention apolies\" leads inevitably to the conclusion that article (8) of Law 43/74 does not contain a standing offer to submit ipso facto any investment disputes to ICSID's arbitration.\n\nIt is to be noted, in this respect, that the Convention differentiates between the consent and an eventual declaration by a host State of its intention to consider submitting certain class or classes of investment disputes to the jurisdiction of the Centre. That declaration is not to be considered consent as explicitly mentioned in the Convention (article 25/4), and no argument has been advanced to sustain that the provision of that article lacks an effet utile. In the same vein, nothing would prevent an investment law from aiming simply to contain such declaration of intention.\n\n25.\n\nIf paragraph one of article (8) of Law 43/74 is to be construed, as Claimants argue, to the effect that the investment disputes must be settled in one or the other of the methods provided for in that paragraph to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Courts of Law this construction would result in an aberrant conclusion that is: if a certain dispute does not fall in the scope of one or the other of these methods it remains unsettled. The intrinsic illogic of the conclusion suffices, by itself, to refute the argument.\n\n26.\n\nNowhere in the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of Law 43/74 does there exist any reference that can support the interpretation of the text of article (8) of Law 43, as advanced by the Claimants.\n\nThe mandatory self-execution effect of the settlement of investment disputes, whether in the manner agreed upon with the investor, or within the framework of either the bilateral treaties or the Convention is totally inconceivable. Only when all the conditions and prerequisites for the application of one of the methods of settlement are met, the dispute in question can be capable of being settled in accordance to that method.\n\n27.\n\nIt does not seem that the Convention is intended in the framework of Law 43/74 to be the safety net of all investment disputes. Nothing in the language of Law 43/74 can lead to this conclusion. Professor Goldmann, wrote following the annulment by the Paris Court of Appeal of the ICC Award that: \"It is true that Article 25 (1) of the Convention subordinates the jurisdiction of the Centre to the written consent of the parties to submit the dispute to it. But it is permitted that, by adopting legislation that provides for ICSID arbitration for investment disputes, a State gives precisely this consent for any dispute of this nature which would appear in the future\" (Claimants final submission on jurisdiction, September 25, 1985, p. 2). In my opinion, the eminent Professor Goldmann kept silent on whether or not Egypt's Law 43/74 contained such an offer. In the same vein and in a more precise assertion, Mr. P.H. Leboulanger, commenting the above mentioned Paris Court of Appeal decision wrote that \"La loi 43/74 en disposant que les litiges relatifs aux investissements \u00e9trangers peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9s par l'arbitrage international n'a, \u00e0 notre sens, aucunement entendu modifier cette distinction et les diff\u00e9rends auxquels l'Etat \u00e9gyptien est partie, s'ils peuvent \u00eatre soumis a l'arbitrage, ne le sont pas n\u00e9cessairement.\" (P.H. Leboulanger -Etat, politique et arbitrage, l'affaire du plateau des pyramides, Revue de l'arbitrage, 1986 N\u00b0 1, p. 11)i.\n\nSince this Tribunal is bound, in the present case, to apply Egyptian Law N\u00b0 43/74, per se, to the finding of the Centre's jurisdiction and of its own competence, as already mentioned, the Tribunal cannot for the interpretation of that Law have recourse to, or rely upon, other materials than the text of the Law itself and, if the necessity arises, the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to elucidate what may seem ambiguous in the text. It is not admissible for the interpretation of a Law to have recourse to, or rely upon, such other materials as the executive regulations and/or a fortiori u pon the investment brochures or the like.\n\nIf Law N\u00b0 43/74 does not contain, by itself, in a clear language and in reasonable understanding the consent of Egypt to the jurisdiction of the Centre and more to arbitration under the auspices of ICSID, then this Tribunal lacks competence in the present case. A State\u2019s consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre is not to be presumed. More, in the doubt of it, a State is not to be considered having waived its immunity. In this respect, as a consequence of the obligation to apply the Egyptian Law N\u00b0 43/74 per se to the finding of jurisdiction, it is imperative to construe the text of that Law in its context as a national Law. In so doing the Tribunal complies with the language and spirit of the Convention.\n\n28.\n\nIt is to be noted that, in the present case, Law N\u00b0 43/74 had been the only legal text issued or published at the time the Claimants entered into their investment engagements in Egypt (September 23, 1974 for the Heads of Agreement, and December 12, 1974 for the contract concluded between the Claimants and the Egyptian General Organization for Tourism and Hotels). As a logical consequence, all contentions to the effect that the Claimants relied, when they entered into the contract upon any other document issued or published other than the text of Law N\u00b0 43/74 are of no relevance since they are in clear contradiction with the facts.\n\nHowever, only for the sake of argument, we intend to deal with the arguments related to the executive regulations and the investment brochures.\n\nNeedless to point out that neither the executive decree of the Minister of Economy N\u00b0 375 of 1977 nor the investment brochures can add to the Law 43/74.\n\nThe executive regulations are confined to the domain of the implementation of the law. Article 144 of the Constitution (of 1971 referred to above) reads as follows, \"The President of the Republic shall issue the necessary regulations for the implementation of the laws in the manner that would not modify, delay or exempt them from execution. He shall have the right to vest others with authority to issue them. The law may determine whoever issues the decision required for its implementation.\" Moreover, Egypt stated, in the oral hearing held in Paris in September 8, 1987, that article 45 of the Decree N\u00b0 375 of 1977 commences as follows \"without prejudice to the provisions of Article 8 of Law...\" and again Egypt in its final memorial on jurisdiction stated that \"A l'audience du 8 septembre, 1987, Me Paulsson, Conseil de SPP, a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que si le d\u00e9cret N\u00b0 375 de 1977 \u00e9tait invoqu\u00e9 par SPP c'\u00e9tait seulement en tant que texte interpr\u00e9tatif de la loi. Il a ainsi admis qu'un tel d\u00e9cret ne pourrait modifier la loi.\" (Egypt\u2019s final memorial p. 47). Even in the translation effectuated by Mr. Saleh and presented by the Claimants (Affidavit, annex 45) it appears that article 45 of the decree deals with the applicable law which is to be determined by the choice of the method of settlement. As pointed out by Egypt and not contested by the Claimants, the Arabic text of Article 45 of the said executive decree adds in fine the phrase : \"dans le cas o\u00f9 elle est applicable\" (Egypt s final memorial p. 50). This proviso d issipates any doubt to the effect that by article 45 of decree, article (8) should be read in the sense that by enacting Law 43/74 Egypt offered to submit the investment disputes to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\nIn this respect it is to be noted that the executive regulations of Law No 43 issued by the Prime Minister's Decree No 91-1975 (Egypt's exhibits 73 and 75) contained in article 55 that \"Subject to the provisions of paragraph one of article 8 of Law 43 for the year 1974, it may be agreed to settle by arbitration investment disputes related to the implementation of the provisions of the Law as well as disputes arising between projects established in the Free Zones or between these projects and the Authority or other authorities or administrative agencies connected with the activities or operations in the Zones.\" Supposedly admitting that it is an exact translation of the Arabic text (Egypt's exhibit 74) as regards the words \"subject to the provisions\", that article does but refer to the provisions of the first paragraph of article (8) of Law 43/74 and hence kept silent on whether or not Egypt did give a standing offer to submit investment disputes to the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n29.\n\nOn the other hand, the investment guides and brochures on investment in Egypt, emphasize that Egypt is a signatory State to the Convention. If Egypt really conceded to ICSID jurisdiction and gave its consent to submit the investment disputes to that jurisdiction, it would have been logical not only to mention the fact that Egypt is a signatory State to the Convention but also to emphasize that it did in fact, after its adherence to the Convention, gave its consent to the Centre's jurisdiction. To point out the only fact of the signature of the Convention, reinforces the conclusion that Egypt did nothing after\n\nIn the Investment Guide of 1975 (Claimants' exhibit 14) it is stated that \"In addition to Law No 43 further incentives for the investor are provided by Decree Law No 60/1971... Investment guarantees are assured in Law N\u00b0 90, 1971, Presidential decrees N\u00b0s 109/1972 and 754/1973' made Egypt a party to international investment treaties\", (emphasis added, p. 11). It is to be noted that the Law 90 of 1971 is the Law by which Egypt ratified its adherence to the Washington Convention, and reference is made to that Law as an incentive by itself, to the investor. No mention was made to any sort of a standing consent to arbitration under ICSID. On page 13 of the same guide, it is written that \"disputes can be settled\" in accordance with international or bilateral agreements or by a mutually agreed upon arbitration.\n\nIn the Legal Guide of 1977 (Claimants' exhibit 15) the guarantees, privileges and exemptions extended to approved investments... \"fall into five categories:\n\na) Guarantees against expropriation\n\nb) Exemption from certain labor, business and other laws\n\nc) Privileges with respect to exchange controls and the expatriation of funds.\n\nd) Exemption from taxation and custom duties, and,\n\ne) Special procedures for the settlement of investment disputes.\"\n\n(p. 30). The guide adds in comment of article (8) of Law 43 \"In the absence of legal provisions to the contrary, investment disputes, like other civil or commercial disputes would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Law. As a means to facilitate foreign investment, law N\u00b0 43 adopts a flexible approach to questions of investment disputes by providing several means for dispute settlement outside the courts. In examining the legal provisions on investment disputes, one roust take account of both article (8) which applies to all disputes related to the implementation of the law, whether inside the country or in the free zones, and article (45) which applies to additional types of disputes in the free zones... Article 8 does not apply to all controversies... Disputes which do not fall within the scope of article (8) are to be settled in the ordinary courts of law or in the administrative courts. Investment disputes falling within the scope of article 8 may be settled in one of four forms\" (p. 38 - 39). Further, the guide adds \"According to the Convention by virtue of Law N\u00b0 90 of 1971, the ArabRepublic of Egypt adhered to the above cited Convention...\" (p. 40) (emphasis added).\n\nIn the official guide to investment in Egypt of 1982 (Claimants\u2019 exhibit 68) it is written that \"In all there are as many as five different ways for eligible types of disputes to be settled. If the foreign investor is a national of one of the countries with which Egypt has bilateral treaties on this subject, the dispute may be settled according to the principles set forth in the treaty. Failing that, the World Bank sponsored Convention on the settlement of investment disputes between States and Nationals of other States sets up an international mechanism for conflict resolution in this area. Since Egypt is a signatory to this Convention, the foreign investor whose country is also a signatory may take advantage of its terms.\" (p. 35) (emphasis added).\n\nIn \"Egypt, the right orientation for your investment\" of 1984 (Claimants\u2019 exhibit 17) the said pamphlet treats on page (8) about the benefits under investment law 43/74 and no mention was made of the method of dispute settlements. The chapter reads as follows : \"Law 43 offers a broad array of benefits to prospective investors: guarantees against nationalisation and confiscation - tax holidays ranging from five to fifteen years from production operation date -clear rules on the international transfer of profits and dividends -repatriation of capital five years after its importation...\" (p. 8) On page 9 of the same publication, it is stated that \"Egypt is a signatory of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes and the right to arbitration of commercial disputes with the Government is recognized by law \", (emphasis added)\n\nReference to Egypt being a signatory State of the Convention logically excludes any conclusion to the effect that Egypt further gave a standing consent to submit investment disputes to ICSID jurisdiction. Such an acceptance, with the consequences that it entails would have been referred to in the investment guides and brochures. This is not to say that, in the present case, these materials can have the effect of adding provisions that do not exist in the investment Law 43/74. Reference is made to assert that the interpretation of law 43/74 cannot lead to the conclusion that Egypt consented to ICSID jurisdiction, more to the arbitration procedures under ICSID/ in the settlement of investment disputes by enacting the said law.\n\nFrom the materials submitted by the Claimants (exhibit 17) one may understand the raison d'etre of such a statement as it appears in the brochure of 1984, published ten years after the enactment of law 43/74. In an article published in \"Arbitration and Domestic Laws: Egyptian Law, Institute of International Business Law and Practice, Paris, December 17-18, 1984.\" Professor El Kosheri explained that \"maintaining a tradition of Islamic Law and/or influenced by old French legal concepts, the Egyptian Code of Civil and Commercial procedures requires, as a general rule, that the parties themselves nominate the arbitrators (article 502 paragraph 3)... this interpretation which met with some support in Court decisions rendered with regard to local arbitration in purely domestic relationship, was thereafter invoked by some Egyptian parties involved in ICC arbitration cases in order to contest the jurisdiction of the arbitrator or the arbitral Tribunals formed in conformity with the rules and regulations of the ICC Court of Arbitration. By claiming that the arbitration clause was null and void because the parties did not themselves select the arbitrator(s) these Egyptian parties requested that the arbitration process be stopped... The first use was by the Egyptian Government itself... even though the Government's challenge did not relate exclusively to the so-called nullity of the arbitration clause for failure of the parties to nominate by mutual consent the persons chosen to act as arbitrators...\" and Professor El Kosheri adds that the Egyptian Cour de Cassation rendered a decision on April 26, 1982 (Case N\u00b0 716 of the Judicial year 47) to the effect that \"Since article 502 (3) Procedures, when requiring the necessary mention of the arbitrator's names in the arbitration agreement, does not relate to public order as previously stated, its violation could not be considered sufficient justification to exclude the application of the foreign governing law.\" (pp. 4-12). It is understandable in these circumstances that, after the Cour de Cassation rendered its decision of 1982, the brochure reflected the outcome of the arbitration clause issue as finally settled by that decision.\n\nMoreover, the \"right\" referred to in that brochure, is conditioned, as any right, by its nature as a situation juridique which necessitates, independently from the recognition of the right by law, the fulfillment of its conditions of establishment in the concrete situation; and on the other hand is, as it is clearly mentioned, restrictively recognized to commercial disputes, to the exclusion of other \"noncommercial\" disputes as those related to administrative acts i.e. emanating from the competent authorities concerning the implementation of the provisions of Law 43/74 (which are, in principle, in the Egyptian legal system, like the French system, part of the Contentieux administratif and hence of the competence of the Conseil d'Etat).\n\n30.\n\nA State's consent to submit itself to the jurisdiction of the Centre is not to be presumed. The language of the Convention is explicit; it differentiates between consent and the intention to submit, or more precisely to consider submitting, a certain dispute or a class of disputes to the jurisdiction of the Centre (Article 25/4 of the Convention). The fact that a State is a signatory to the Convention does not imply a presumption to consent, nor does the fact that request for arbitration is registered. The screening powers of the Secretary General, in this respect, can have no influence upon the issue of jurisdiction which is of the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n31.\n\nAs a matter of principle, whether in international law or in national laws, a sovereign State enjoys an immunity from being subject to adjudication without its consent. A waiver of such an immunity is not to be presumed, but roust be proved, and the burden of proof rests upon the party claiming the contrary. The Convention did not intend to deviate from this principle. The corner stone of the jurisdiction of the Centre is the consent. To the conclusion that for the establishment of the Centre's jurisdiction it must be proved that the State and the Investor both consented to the jurisdiction. In my opinion, the Claimants did not present evidence to the effect that Egypt, a signatory State to the Convention, consented, in a clear unequivocal language to submit the present dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and more to the arbitration procedures provided for by the Convention.\n\nI may add, in this respect, that it seems that the Claimants themselves, were aware of the fact that Law 43/74 does not contain such a standing offer. The Heads of Agreement concluded on September 23, 1974 between: The Ministry of Tourism, the Egyptian General Organization for Tourism and Hotels and the Southern Pacific Properties Limited (the Claimants), contains reference that it was issued in accordance with certain laws inter alia Law N\u00b0 43/74. Reference to Law 43/74 reads as follows : \"This agreement is issued in accordance with Law... and Law 43 for the year 1974 relating to Arab and Foreign Funds invested in the A.R.E. with particular reference to government guarantees long term tax holidays, exemptions from import customs duties, etc...\" If Law N\u00b0 43/74 contained, as Claimants argue, a standing offer by Egypt to submit investment disputes to arbitration under ICSID it would have, logically, been explicitly referred to.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants could not have relied upon any text or document, other than the only text of Law N\u00b0 43 of 1974 since that Law was the only text issued by the time they concluded the Heads of Agreement on September 23, 1974 and entered into the contract of December 12, 1974 with the Egyptian General Organization for Tourism and Hotels.\n\nSECOND PART - Some Observations and Comments in Reponse to the Decision of April 14, 1988.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Preliminary Decision dated November 27, 1985, (hereinafter called the Preliminary Decision) stated in paragraph (31) that \"Construction work began at the Pyramids Oasis site in July of 1977. The Claimants have explained in their pleadings that such construction work commenced with roads, sewage systems, water reservoir facilities, artificial lakes, and a golf course.\" (emphasis added)\n\nThe usage of this subtle language is justified by the fact that the only debated question before the Tribunal was the issue of jurisdiction, consequently the Tribunal was under the obligation not to adopt and incorporate in its own fact findings any unproved allegations related to the subject matter, advanced by either party to the dispute.\n\nHowever, it seems that the Decision of April 14, 1988, (hereinafter called the Decision), departed from that obligation, without any justification, since it states in paragraph (41) that \"in July of 1977, Claimants commenced construction at the Pyramids Oasis site. Work was begun on roads, sewage systems, water reservoir facilities,artificial lakes and a golf course\", (emphasis added)\n\n2.\n\nThe Preliminary Decision dealt with Egypt's objection to the jurisdiction of the Centre based upon the legal restrictive nature of the provisions of Article 8 of Law N\u00b0 43/1974, to disputes concerning the non-performance of obligations under law 43 as distinct from disputes involving non-performance of obligations under a contractual relation (paragraphs 67, 68 and 69). Article 8 of Law 43, stipulates in relevant part that \"Investment disputes in respect of the implementation of the provisions of this Law shall be settled...\" (emphasis added). Egypt explained that the means of settlement set forth in article 8 of law 43 are to be applied only as regards disputes arising out of a breach of a provision contained in Law 43 and thus do not cover any other dispute that may arise from a breach of a contract. In this respect, and in support to its contention, Egypt cited the July 12, 1984 decision of the Paris Court of Appeal wherein that Court said that article 8 of Law 43 \"... ne vise, au surplus, que les seules contestations ayant trait \u00e0 l'investissement et concernant la mise en ex\u00e9cution des dispositions de la loi en cause, mais non celles de tel ou tel contrat\" (emphasis added). The Preliminary Decision did not address that objection and stated that \"however, it is not necessary, for the purpose of the present decision, to address this question, since Egypt's objection may be simply answered by the recapitulation of certain facts...\" (paragraph 68), to the conclusion that in this respect it is quite clear that \"the present dispute, thus, is within the scope of article 8, since it concerns the implementation of the provisions of this law, namely the protection from any measure of, or amounting to, nationalization or confiscation.\" (paragraph 69).\n\nAs the Decision of the majority kept silent as regards this issue and concluded in its operative part that further proceeding on the merits be instructed by the President of the Tribunal, consequently it is legitimate to conceive that the Decision maintained the Tribunal's previous statement to the effect that the Centre's jurisdiction and the Tribunal's competence, in the present case, are to be confined and limited to the only cause of action based upon the allegation of a breach of a legal provision concerning the implementation of the provisions of Law N\u00b0 43; i.e., the prohibition of nationalization and confiscation (article 7 of Law 43). '\n\nIt would, thus, have been appropriate to indicate in the operative part of the Decision this conclusion explicity, since the request for arbitration referred to both the breach of the provisions of Law N\u00b0 43 and the Heads of agreement of September 1974.\n\n3.\n\nThe Decision seems to have concluded to the admittance of the intervention, in the course of the arbitration proceedings, of SPP, a third party to the instituted arbitration under the auspices of ICSID. In the preliminary Decision, the Tribunal stated that \"On. February 8, 1985, the Tribunal conducted a preliminary meeting with the Parties (i.e. SPP (ME) and Egypt) at the Hague and that the Parties placed on record their agreement to the effect that \"...the Tribunal has been properly constituted in accordance with Section 2 of the ICSID Convention and Chapter 1 of the Arbitration Rules\" (paragraph 9) and further stated that \"On July 23,1985, the parties advised the centre that Southern Pacific Properties Limited (hereinafter called SPP or the Claimant), the parent Company of SPP (ME) and also a Hong Kong Corporation, had been joined as a Claimant in the proceedings, subject to Egypt's reservation of jurisdictional defenses\" (paragraph 14).\n\nAs the question of jurisdiction was the prime issue to be dealt with by the Tribunal, the Preliminary Decision had not to rule over the admissibility of the intervention of SPP in the course of the proceedings. On the other hand as the Decision of April 14, 1988, ruled over the question of jurisdiction and concluded to proceed with the merits, it would have been necessary, from the legal point of view, to address the question of the admissibility of SPP's intervention, even ex officio, before further proceeding to the merits.\n\nAs Egypt maintained its objection to the jurisdiction of the Centre, it cannot be assumed that it agreed that SPP joins in the proceedings before a Tribunal of which it contests the competence. It is true that an arbitral Tribunal under the auspices of ICSID is empowered to decide questions of procedure not covered by the Convention or the Arbitration rules on the basis of the provisions of article 44 of the Conyention as explained in the Introductory notes to the Arbitrations Rules to the effect that \"that provision (i.e., article 44 of the Convention) is in fact, only declaratory of the inherent power of any arbitral tribunal to formulate its own rules of procedure in the event of a lacuna. Nevertheless, in compliance to and in accordance with the language and the spirit of the Convention and the general principles of procedures, it is legitimate to necessitate that any request for intervention, whether it be an \"intervention principale ou agressive\", or an \"intervention accessoire ou conservatoire \", be introduced to the Centre by the same way and complying with all the requirements of a request for arbitration. In this respect, the arbitral Tribunal cannot act separately apart from the Centre. The Tribunal's competence cannot exceed the scope of the disputes, rationae personae and rationae materiae, deferred to it by the Centre. The Centre, by the Secretary General has screening powers as regards the requests for arbitration, and the rules require documents to be filed with the request for arbitration in ter alia documents concerning the nationality of the juridical person (Institution Rules, Rule 2).\n\nMoreover, the provisions of the Convention (Article 36/2) necessitate that the consent to arbitration precedes the request for arbitration and nothing was advanced during the proceedings before this Tribunal to the effect that SPP consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre before its intervention. In this respect it has been explained that \"Le consentement doit n\u00e9cessairement intervenir avant la saisine du Centre. Les articles qui r\u00e9glementent l'introduction de la requ\u00eate soit en vue de la conciliation (art. 28 par. 2), soit en vue de l'arbitrage (art. 36 par. 2) font obligation \u00e0 la partie demanderesse de fournir des informations sur le consentement dans sa requ\u00eate. L'application du forum prorogatum semble donc exclue.\" (R. Kovar, La comp\u00e9tence du Centre... in Investissements \u00e9trangers et arbitrage entre Etats et personnes priv\u00e9es, Paris Pedone 1969, p. 49).\n\nMoreover, it is to be noted, that the Decision of April 14, 1988 expressly mentions that it is rendered in the Arbitration case N\u00b0 ARB/84/3, between SPP (ME) and Egypt without any mention of SPP while in its operative part it deals with \"the Claimants\" submissions. Related to the question of the nationality of the \"Claimants\" the Decision comes to the conclusion that they are \"nationals of another contracting State\" on the basis that the Claimants are Hong Kong corporations domiciled in Hong Kong, and since Hong Kong is a territory for whose international relations the United Kingdom, a party to the Convention, is responsible and has expressly extended the application of the Convention to Hong Kong \"hence the Claimants are nationals of another contracting State within the meaning of article 25 of the Washington Convention\" (paragraph 54).\n\nThe Convention kept silent as regards the criterion of the nationality of juridical persons, whether it be as explains Kovar \"Les crit\u00e8res du si\u00e8ge social, de l'incorporation et du contr\u00f4le\", (op. cit. p. 44) In the same context it was explained that \"on ne voit pas bien pourquoi il faudrait donner la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence au crit\u00e8re du lieu de constitution plut\u00f4t qu'a celui de l'endroit o\u00f9 se trouve le si\u00e8ge social r\u00e9el, de l'incorporation ou encore du lieu d'exploitation\". (L. Levy : La nationalit\u00e9 des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, Paris LGDJ 1984, p. 120). It would have been legitimate to expect at least that the Decision mentions that the Tribunal was satisfied eventually, that the Claimants are, in application of the private international law of the United Kingdom, nationals of the United Kingdom within the meaning of article 25 of the Convention.\n\n4.\n\nAs it seems impossible to demonstrate that Egypt by enacting Law N\u00b0 43/1974 gave, in article 8 of that Law,a standing offer to submit investment disputes to arbitration, specifically, under the auspices of ICSID, the Decision stated that \"Once consent has been given to the jurisdiction of the Centre, the Convention and its implementing regulations afford the means for making the choice between the two methods of the dispute settlement. The Convention leaves that choice to the party instituting the proceedings\" (paragraph 102 (emphasis added),\n\nIn support of that statement the Decision does not provide any legal argument or refer to any provision of the Convention or of the implementing regulations,. It is rather a matter of fact statement.\n\nHowever, that statement can hardly be supported by a provision of either the Convention or the Regulations and Rules of ICSID. As already mentioned in the first part of this dissenting opinion, the Conyention provides for two distinct methods of dispute settlement. Consequently the consent to the \"jurisdiction\" of the Centre must specify in a clear unequivocal language the method of settlement consented to. In addition to the arguments already explained in detail in the first part of this dissenting opinion, it is significant to review the language of article (25/2-b) of the Convention which reads as follows \"Any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration...\" and the language of article (26) which provides that \"consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy...\"\n\n5.\n\nThe decision states that \"Egypt is correct in its assertion that Law N\u00b0 43 is applicable to the jurisdictional issues in the present case in the sense that article 8 of Law N\u00b0 43 is alleged by the Claimants to constitute Egypt's consent to the Centre jurisdiction\", (paragraph 57) and it further stated that \"Also to the extent that article 8 is alleged to be a unilateral declaration of acceptance of the Centre's jurisdiction, subject to reciprocal acceptance by a national of another contracting State, the Tribunal must also consider certain aspects of international law governing unilateral juridical acts\" (pargraph 51) to the conclusion that \"Thus, in deciding whether in the circumstances of the present case Law N\u00b0 43 constitutes consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, the Tribunal will apply general principles of statutory interpretation taking into consideration, where appropriate, relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations (paragraph 61).\n\nIf Law N\u00b0 43 is applicable, per se, to the issue of whether or not Egypt gave a standing offer to submit investment disputes to the jurisdiction of ICSID, any allegation, to the effect that Law N\u00b0 43 does in fact provide for that offer, cannot afford to alter the legal nature of the provisions of the Law as such. Consequently, in the present case, the provisions of Law N\u00b0 43, a national Law to be applied as such as -regards the issue of jurisdiction, are not to be construed \"taking into consideration the relevant rules of treaty interpretation and the principles of international law\". Upon the mere allegations advanced by the Claimants, the Decision seems to consider Law 43 as a unilateral international declaration, to be construed in the light of the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice concerning unilateral declarations under the so-called \"optional clause\" of the Court's statutes. (The Decision, paragraph 61).\n\n6.\n\nThe Decision, after reviewing the text of article 8 of Law N\u00b0 43 in its authentic language as well as the various translations submitted to the Tribunal by the Parties, comes to the conclusion that \"the first paragraph of article 8, however is only mandatory to the extent that any of the three methods of dispute settlement mentioned therein is applicable to the particular dispute\", and explains that \"this conditional aspect of article 8, which qualifies the mandatory nature thereof, fully explains the use of the term tatimu rather than a more imperative yerb form in the first paragraph of article 8.' (paragraph 79)\n\nThis accurate statement, seems in contradiction with the conclusion that Egypt by enacting Law N\u00b0 43, gave in its article 8 a standing offer to submit investment disputes to arbitration under the auspices of ICSID. The language of that article cannot be reasonably construed to that effect. Since the first paragraph of article 8 of Law N\u00b0 43 states that investment disputes are to be settled, or even arguendo shall be settled, in the framework of the Convention and where it applies, it is legitimate to conclude that settlement under the auspices of ICSID is conditional upon the satisfaction of the requirements necessitated by the Convention, inter alia the consent to that effect.\n\nThe Decision, however, seems to differentiate between the required consent and the other requirements for the establishment of ICSID's jurisdiction : rationae personae and rationae materiae. In this context, one can legitimately wonder about the raison d'etre of the proviso \"where it (i.e. the Convention) applies\" that appears in fine of the first paragraph of article 8 of Law N\u00b0 43. The effet utile, so much referred to during the proceedings, warrant the conclusion that the proviso must have a reasonable meaning, and no such meaning can be drawn from the proviso other than that it necessitates the fulfillment of all the requirements to the establishment of ICSID jurisdiction, inter alia the consent of the parties to that jurisdiction.\n\n7.\n\nIn support to its conclusion, the Decision seems to have relied upon the difference between the language of the first paragraph of article 8 of Law No 43 and the language of another article of that Law, namely article 45 which provides that \"Disputes arising between projects established in Free Zones, or arising between such projects and the Authority or any other Authorities or administrative bodies connected with the business activities within the zone may be submitted, by agreement, to arbitration. An arbitration board shall be instituted to decide the dispute...\". The Decision states in this respect that \"the drafters of Law N\u00b0 43 were careful to provide specifically in article 45 for separate agreement to establish the jurisdiction of the arbitration Board to settle disputes involving projects in the Free Zones. Contrasted with the silence of article 8 with respect to any separate ad hoc consent to ICSID jurisdiction, the language of article 45 of Law N\u00b0 43 militates against the conclusion that the phrases within the framework of the Convention\" and \"where it applies' were intended to imply a requirement of separate ad hoc consent to establish the jurisdiction of the Centre\" (paragraph 93).\n\nFrom the outset, needless to point out that the method of reasoning a contrario is the most feeable method of reasoning. To establish the intention of Egypt to give a standing offer to submit investment disputes to ICSID jurisdiction, by a contrario reasoning is a conclusion in complete contradiction with the express language of article 8 which refers to settlement of investment disputes in the framework of the Convention where it applies, and as a general principle A verbi s Legis non est recendendum. Moreover, it contravenes the whole mechanism of the Convention based upon the consent of the parties to that jurisdiction. The requirement of the consent, in the framework of the Convention, as explained in the first part of this dissenting opinion, necessitates that the consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre be certain. Since Professor Reuter explained this requirement in 1969 it was never contested (P. Reuter, R\u00e9flexions sur la comp\u00e9tence du Centre, in Investissements \u00e9trangers et arbitrage entre Etats et personnes priv\u00e9es, Paris, Pedone, 1969, p. 14).\n\nNowhere in the first paragraph of article 8 of Law No 43 is there any reference to arbitration. Reference is only made to the Convention \"where it applies\". For the Convention to apply, that is for the jurisdiction of the Centre to be established, it is required that the parties to the dispute give their consent to that effect. The Decision also states that \"the provision in article 8 for dispute settlement in a manner to be agreed upon with the investor is sufficient to authorize ad hoc consent to the Centre's jurisdiction\" (Paragraph 96),\n\nThat statement seems to overlook two considerations :\n\na- That nothing would prevent the national legislator, if he deems appropriate, to codify, in an investment law, various provisions even and eventually emanating from applicable treaties. Reference to Egypt\u2019s adherence to the Convention, and hence to the possibility to settle investment disputes in the framework of the Convention \"where it applies\" is manifestly a provision of a declaratory legal nature. By its very legal nature, it adds nothing to Egypt's adherence to the Convention.\n\nb- That nothing prevents Egypt as a contracting State to the Convention from declaring, if and when it considers appropriate, that it would consider submitting a class or classes of investment disputes to the jurisdiction of ICSID. This declaration is not to be construed to the effect that it constitutes the required consent to ICSID jurisdiction unless otherwise unequivocally stated.\n\nFor the above mentioned considerations, I feel obliged to dissent from the Decision of the Eminent Members of the Majority. However, I feel obliged to give them their due tribute for the meticulous study and the highest professional care demonstrated in their Decision."}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn August 24, 1984, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter called \"the Centre\" or \"ICSID\") received a Request for Arbitration from Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited (hereinafter called \"SPP(ME)\" or \"the Claimant\"), a Hong Kong corporation. The Request stated that SPP(ME) wished to institute arbitration proceedings under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (hereinafter called \"the Washington Convention\" or \"the Convention\") against the Arab Republic of Egypt (hereinafter called \"ARE,\" \"Egypt,\" or \"the Respondent\"), and asked for the following relief:\n\nSPP(ME) respectfully requests ICSID to establish an arbitral tribunal to:\n\n1. determine that the ARE has undertaken obligations and incurred duties in respect to SPP(ME) both according to the terms of Law No. 43 and according to the Heads of Agreement of September 1974 specifically entered into by a Member of its Government, as well as by a Supplemental Agreement \"approved, agreed and ratified\" by the same Member of its Government.\n\n2. determine that the ARE violated its obligations thereunder,\n\n3. adopt and incorporate as its own the pertinent findings of fact made by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal concerning SPP(ME)'s performance of its obligations under its agreements, the dismissal of EGOTH's counterclaim therein, and the acts bringing about termination of the investment project,\n\n4. determine the liability of the ARE to compensate SPP(ME) for the termination of its investment agreements and to award the full measure of indemnification to SPP(ME) on account of the destruction of its investment, increased by the additional costs, including all direct and indirect costs of the present proceedings, occasioned by ARE's wrongful refusal to honor the ICC award of February 16, 1983, or otherwise compensate SPP(ME), as well as interest at commercial rates.\n\n2.\n\nOn August 28, 1984, the Secretary-General of ICSID sent an acknowledgement of the Request to SPP (ME) and transmitted a copy of the Request to Egypt. On the same day, the Secretary-General registered the Request in the Arbitration Register and notified the Parties accordingly.\n\n3.\n\nOn August 29, 1984, the Secretary-General notified the Parties by telex that:\n\n... THE ARABIC TEXT OF ARTICLE 8 OF LAW NO. 43 OF 1974 REFERS TO THE SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ICSID CONVENTION IN THE CASES WHERE IT (I.E., THE CONVENTION) APPLIES, AND NOT, AS ERRONEOUSLY MENTIONED IN THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION, WHERE LAW NO. 90 OF 1971 RATIFYING THE CONVENTION APPLIES. I HAVE, THUS, REGISTERED THE REQUEST OF SPP WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE QUESTION WHETHER SAID ARTICLE EIGHT CONSTITUTES CONSENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ICSID CONVENTION OR MERELY INCLUDES A REFERENCE TO THIS CONVENTION IN THE CASES WHERE CONSENT FOR ICSID JURISDICTION IS ISSUED SEPARATELY. THIS MATTER, IF RAISED, WILL BE FOR THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL TO DECIDE.\n\n4.\n\nOn August 29, 1984, the Centre received from SPP (ME) a proposal that a sole arbitrator be appointed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 2(1)(a), or, alternatively, that the Parties jointly nominate an individual as President of the Tribunal.\n\n5.\n\nIn a communication received by the Centre on November 12, 1984, Egypt stated that it contested the Centre's competence with respect to the present dispute, and that no action undertaken in proceedings concerning SPP(ME)'s request could be deemed a renunciation of such jurisdictional objections. Egypt rejected SPP(ME)'s proposals for the constitution of the Tribunal, and proposed as an alternative a Tribunal consisting of three members, with Dr. Eduardo JIMENEZ DE ARECHAGA serving as President of - the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 4, the Parties agreed on November 26, 1984, to extend to December 3, 1984, the period for nominating their respective arbitrators and for agreement on the President of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn November 26, 1984, Egypt designated Dr. Mohamed Amin EL MAHDI, an Egyptian national, as an arbitrator pursuant to Arbitration Rule 3. SPP(ME) informed the Centre on November 30, 1984, that it did not object to the nationality of the arbitrator named by Egypt, as it might have done under Arbitration Rule 3(1)(a)(i), and that it was designating Mr. Robert F. PIETROWSKI, Jr., a U.S. national, as an arbitrator. Further, SPP(ME) informed the Centre that it consented to Egypt\u2019s proposal that Dr. JIMENEZ DE ARECHAGA be appointed President of the Tribunal. Dr. JIMENEZ DE ARECHAGA accepted his appointment on December 5, 1984, and Mr, PIETROWSKI accepted his appointment on December 7, 1984.\n\n8.\n\nOn December 18, 1984, the Centre received notice that Dr. EL MAHDI accepted his appointment as an arbitrator, and the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Tribunal was constituted and that the proceedings were deemed to have begun in accordance with Arbitration Rule 6(1).\n\n9.\n\nOn February 8, 1985, the Tribunal conducted a preliminary meeting with the Parties at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague. The Parties placed on record their agreement to the effect that:\n\n... the Tribunal has been properly constituted in accordance with Section 2 of the ICSID Convention and Chapter 1 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 20 it was decided that the Arbitration Rules in effect up to September 26, 1984, would apply; that the procedural languages would be English and French; and that the seat of the arbitration would be Washington.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal decided at the preliminary meeting to suspend the proceedings on the merits pending a decision on Egypt's jurisdictional objections, and that the proceedings on jurisdiction would consist of written pleadings and oral argument. The following schedule was set for the filing of the written pleadings on jurisdiction:\n\n(a) Egypt's observations to be filed by May 8, 1985; and\n\n(b) SPP(ME)'s observations to be filed by June 19, 1985.\n\n11.\n\nThe observations of both Parties were filed within the prescribed time limits.\n\nEgypt, in its observations, submitted that the Tribunal should :\n\n... for all of the grounds explained above... declare itself incompetent to hear the claims presented by SPP(ME).\n\nThe observations of SPP(ME) submitted that the Tribunal should ;\n\n... reject Respondent's objections to the Centre's jurisdiction over this dispute between SPP(ME) and the Government of Egypt regarding the State's failure to compensate this foreign investor for the losses it suffered as a result of the State's cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis Project.\n\n12.\n\nOn 8 July 1985, the Centre received from Egypt a document responding to certain arguments set forth in SPP(ME)'s observations concerning interpretation of Egypt's Law No. 4 3 Concerning the Investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the free Zones.\n\n13.\n\nOral argument on the question of jurisdiction was held at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague on July 10 and 11, 1985. The hearings were recorded in the form of a verbatim transcript in the English and French languages. At the end of the oral proceedings, the Tribunal requested that the Parties submit certain additional materials concerning Egypt's Law No. 43.\n\n14.\n\nOn July 23, 1985, the Parties advised the Centre that Southern Pacific Properties Limited (hereinafter called \"SPP\" or \"Claimant\"), the parent company of SPP(ME) and also a Hong Kong corporation, had been joined as a claimant in the proceedings subject to Egypt's reservation of jurisdictional defenses.\n\n15.\n\nIn response to the request made by the Tribunal at the end of the oral proceedings, the Claimants and the Respondent filed supplemental materials concerning Law No. 43 on August 21 and August 27, 1985.\n\n16.\n\nOn November 27, 1985, the Tribunal rendered a decision by which it unanimously rejected certain of Egypt's objections concerning jurisdiction and stayed the proceedings on Egypt's remaining jurisdictional objections pending final disposition by the French courts of certain concurrent proceedings involving the same dispute. The operative part of the Tribunal's decision provided:\n\nTHE TRIBUNAL UNANIMOUSLY DECIDES:\n\nA. To reject the objections to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent alleging that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, as well as the pursuit by the Claimants of alternative remedies, bar the claim in the present case;\n\nB. To reject the objection to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent alleging the withdrawal from the Claimant of the benefits of Law No. 43;\n\nC. To reject the objection to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent contending that the provisions of Article 8 of Law No. 43 do not apply to this investment dispute; and\n\nD. To stay the present proceedings on the Respondent\u2019s remaining objections to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction until the proceedings in the French Courts have finally resolved the question of whether the parties agreed to submit their dispute to the jurisdiction of the International Chamber of Commerce.\n\n17.\n\nOn January 6, 1987, the French Court of Cassation issued a decision the effect of which was to finally determine that Egypt had not consented to submit the present dispute to the jurisdiction of the International Chamber of Commerce.\n\n18.\n\nOn January 29, 1987, the Claimants filed a request with the Tribunal asking that the present proceedings be resumed in view of the Court of Cassation\u2019s decision of January 6, 1987,\n\n19.\n\nOn March 24, 1987, at the request of Egypt, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file further written pleadings and supporting materials.\n\n20.\n\nEgypt filed a \"M\u00e9moire\" dated April 30, 1987, and requested further hearings on the remaining jurisdictional issues. The Claimants then filed \"Observations on Respondent's Jurisdictional Memorandum\" dated May 20, 1987.\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal met in London on May 25-27, 1987. After reviewing the new materials filed by the Parties, and in consideration of its Decision of November 27, 1985, and the decision of the French Court of Cassation of January 6, 1987, the Tribunal unanimously decided to accede to Egypt\u2019s request for a further hearing on the question of the Centre's jurisdiction. It notified the Parties that a final hearing on the jurisdictional issues would be held in Paris in September of 1987, and that the Parties' final submissions concerning jurisdiction, together with an enumeration of the arguments relied upon to support those submissions, were to be filed following the hearing.\n\n22.\n\nThe final hearing on the question of jurisdiction was held in Paris on September 8, 1987. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal instructed the Parties to present in writing their final submissions on the jurisdictional issues, together with an enumeration of the arguments relied on to support those submissions, by September 25, 1987.\n\n23.\n\nThe \"Claimant's Final Submission on Jurisdiction\" dated September 25, 1987, submitted that the Tribunal should :\n\n... determine in favor of the Claimants the remaining jurisdictional issue, to rule that the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"A.R.E.\") has consented to ICSID arbitration in conformity with the requirement of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and to take jurisdiction over the investment dispute between the parties.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent's \"M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9plique\" dated September 25, 1987, did not contain formal submissions as such, but reiterated certain points made by counsel for Egypt at the hearing held in Paris on September 8, 1987, and responded to arguments made by counsel for the Claimants at that hearing.\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal conducted its final deliberations on the question of jurisdiction in Washington on December 7-12, 1987.\n\n26.\n\nThe facts which have given rise to the present dispute are as follows:\n\nOn September 23, 1974, a contract entitled \"Heads of Agreement\" was entered into by the Government of Egypt (represented by the Minister of Tourism), the Egyptian General Organization for Tourism and Hotels (hereinafter called \"EGOTH\"), and SPP, a company engaged in the development of tourist and resort facilities. EGOTH was at the time a public sector enterprise under the Minister of Tourism, organized under Egyptian Law No. 60 of 1971.\n\n27.\n\nThe Heads of Agreement by its terms was entered into in accordance with certain Egyptian laws, including Law No. 43 of 1974 Concerning the Investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the Free Zones. In the Heads of Agreement, EGOTH and SPP undertook to incorporate an Egyptian joint venture company to develop tourist complexes at the Pyramids Oasis site near Cairo and at Ras El Hekma on the Mediterranean coast. These projects were to be developed according to detailed master plans prepared by SPP and approved by EGOTH. The Ministry of Tourism agreed to secure the title to property and the possession of land necessary for the development of the proposed projects. The Ministry of Tourism and EGOTH undertook to transfer the right of usufruct for such property to the joint stock company as part of the capital investment. The Minister of Tourism and EGOTH undertook to assist in obtaining all local approvals for the execution of the projects in accordance with the plans to be submitted by SPP and approved by EGOTH. SPP for its part agreed to obtain the necessary financing for the projects, and to provide or arrange for all technical expertise required for designing, constructing, managing, and marketing the projects.\n\n28.\n\nThe Preamble of the Heads of Agreement, which was expressly made part of the agreement by Article 1, provided: Whereas the Ministry of Tourism approved :\n\nWhereas the Ministry of Tourism approved granting both 2nd and 3rd party [i.e. EGOTH and SPP] the right to develop the areas as shown in the attached maps in the Pyramid's area and Pas El Hekma Zone.\n\nThis agreement is issued in accordance with laws No. 1 for the year 197 3 relating to Hotels Installations and Tourism, and law No. 2 for the year 1973 relating to the supervision by the Ministry of Tourism on touristic sites and the development of such areas, and law 43 for the year 1974 relating to Arab and foreign funds invested in the A.R.E. with particular reference to government guarantees, long term tax holidays, exemptions from import custom duties, etc.\n\nArticle 2 of the Heads of Agreement provided:\n\nBoth 2nd and 3rd parties undertake to incorporate promptly an Egyptian joint venture company of which 40 percent would be subscribed by E.G.O.T.H. and 60 percent by S.P.P. (for the Pyramid area) and 30 percent by E.G.O.T.H. and 70 percent by S.P.P. (for Ras El Hekma).\n\nArticle 4 provided:\n\nFIRST Party will secure the title of property and possession of land and both First and second party undertake to transfer the right of usufruct to the joint company as its part of the capital investment. Both M.T. and E.G.O.T.H. undertake to transfer such right to the joint company immediately upon incorporation, any balance being transferred not later than 90 days thereafter.\n\n29.\n\nOn December 12, 1974, a contract entitled \"Agreement for the Development of Two International Tourist Projects in Egypt\" (hereinafter called \"the December Agreement\") was concluded between EGOTH and SPP concerning the projects at the Pyramids Oasis and Ras El Hekma sites. The Preamble of the December Agreement referred to the Heads of Agreement saying that:\n\nFollowing execution of the Heads of Agreement dated 23rd September, 1974,... and subsequent negotiations between the above parties, the following are agreed....\n\nArticle 1 of the December Agreement then provided that a joint venture company with registered shares would be incorporated in Egypt for a renewable period of fifty years. This company, called the \"Egyptian Tourist Development Company\" (hereinafter referred to as \"ETDC\"), was to be responsible for the development and operation of the projects. The nominal capital of ETDC was initially set at two million United States dollars, to be increased to ten million dollars at the end of the fifth year. Sixty percent of this capital was to be subscribed by SPP, and the remaining forty percent by EGOTH. On the fiftieth anniversary of the incorporation of ETDC, EGOTH was to be entitled to increase its shareholding at no cost to fifty percent of the total capital. The participation of EGOTH in the capital of ETDC was represented by the rights of usufruct referred to in Articles 5 and 6 of the agreement. Article 5 of the December Agreement stipulated that EGOTH would:\n\n... use its best efforts to secure all the necessary Government approvals to enable ETDC the immediate possession of the land in both sites, and to ensure the transfer of the rights of usufruct to ETDC for its duration....\n\n30.\n\nThe December Agreement also provided that SPP would incorporate a holding company to own its shareholding in the joint venture. Article 17 of the December Agreement provided:\n\nIt is understood that SPP will be incorporating a holding company to own its shareholding in ETDC and it is agreed that SPP shall have the right to assign its rights, privileges, duties and obligations under this Agreement to this company in which SPP will have a controlling, but not necessarily majority, interest and in which it controls and directs management, provided the company satisfies EGOTH.\n\nSuch an assignment was subsequently made to SPP(ME), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPP formed in 1974 to undertake the execution of the projects at the Pyramids Oasis and Ras El Hekma sites.\n\n31.\n\nThe December Agreement was expressly concluded in accordance with certain Egyptian laws, including Law No. 43. It contained an arbitration clause which provided that any disputes relating to the agreement would be submitted to the International Chamber of Commerce (hereinafter called \"the ICC\") in Paris for arbitration.\n\n32.\n\nOn the final page of the December Agreement, following the signatures of the representatives of EGOTH and SPP, there appeared the typewritten statement, \"Approved, agreed and ratified by the Minister of Tourism, His Excellency, Mr. Ibrahim Naguib, on the Twelfth day of December, 1974.\" Next to this statement the signature of the Minister and an official stamp were affixed.\n\n33.\n\nOn the same date that the December Agreement was signed, the representatives of EGOTH and SPP also signed a \"statement\" which provided:\n\nIt is understood between contracting parties (EGOTH) and (S.P.P.) in concern of the agreement signed on the 12th of December 197 4, that obligations which lie on EGOTH are subject to the approval of the competent governmental authorities and that the feasibility study proves the profitability of the projects.\n\n34.\n\nBy a letter dated April \u00cf2, 1975, the Board of Directors of the General Organization for Investment of Arab Capital and Tax-Free Zones approved the application for the establishment of a combined tourist company by EGOTH and SPP for the development of the tourist areas at the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma sites. This approval was conditioned upon the presentation by the joint venture company to the Board of Directors of a complete economic feasibility study. The decision provided that the beneficial rights would be for a period of 50 years and then would revert to the State. This period was subsequently extended to 99 years, subject to compliance with certain Egyptian laws.\n\n35.\n\nOn May 22, 1975, the President of Egypt issued Decree No. 475 of 1975 \"(t)o specify the use of the lands on Pyramids Site and Ras El Hekma Site... for tourist purposes.\" The Decree provided that EGOTH \"will either alone or with one of the Companies in which it is a partner develop and use these two sites.\"\n\n36.\n\nOn October 19, 1975, EGOTH, as sole owner of the sites mentioned in Presidential Decree No. 475, irrevocably transferred its right of usufruct for the sites \"without restriction of any kind\" to the joint venture ETDC. This right of usufruct was transferred for the life of ETDC.\n\n37.\n\nOn November 23, 1975, a contract between EGOTH and SPP(ME) for the incorporation of a joint venture was concluded in conformity with Law No. 1 of 1973 Concerning Tourist Establishments and Law No. 43 of 1974. The incorporation was authorized by Ministerial Decree No. 212 of 1975. This Decree referred in its preamble to the Decrees of the Prime Minister, No. 91 of 1975 Promulgating the Executive Regulations of Law No. 43 of 1974, and No. 92 of 1975 Concerning the Pattern of Contract and Statutes Covering the Projects Created Under the Provisions of Law No. 43.\n\n38.\n\nBy a letter dated April 1, 1976, the Chairman of EGOTH notified the Chairman of ETDC of the \"formal approval of the MT [Ministry of Tourism] and EGOTH of the Pyramids Oasis project as a whole....\"\n\n39.\n\nOn October 19, 1976, the Minister of Tourism wrote to the Chairman of ETDC, stating:\n\nI am writing to confirm my formal approval to the development and construction of your project.... This approval entitles you to proceed with your programme without the necessity of further reference to this Ministry.\n\n40.\n\nOn June 1, 1977, Ministerial Decree No. 96 of 1977 was issued. Article 1 of this Decree provided:\n\nThe Ministry of Tourism approves the master planning for the tourist Pyramids Plateau Area, as well as the detailed planning of the first phase regarding the implementation of villages nos. 1, 3 and 21 of the project of exploiting the tourist Giza Pyramids Plateau....\n\n41.\n\nIn July of 1977, Claimants commenced construction at the Pyramids Oasis site. Work was begun on roads, sewage systems, water reservoir facilities, artificial lakes and a golf course.\n\n42.\n\nIn late 1977, the Pyramids Oasis project began to encounter political opposition in Egypt, and it became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. Opponents of the project claimed that it posed a threat to undiscovered antiquities.\n\n43.\n\nIn a decree issued on May 27, 1978, the Ministry of Culture declared \"the land surrounding the Pyramids\" to be public property. This decree was issued upon the recommendation of the Egyptian Antiquities Authority, which confirmed the presence of antiquities in the western part of the Al Giza Pyramids region.\n\n44.\n\nOn May 28, 1978, the General Organization for Investments, by Resolution 1/51-78, \"decided to drop its former issued agreement...concerning the Pyramids Plateau....\"\n\n45.\n\nOn June 19, 1978, Presidential Decree No. 267 cancelled Presidential Decree No. 475, which had designated \"the lands on the Pyramids plateau in Giza for touristic exploitation.\" On July 11, 1978, the Prime Minister of Egypt issued a decree declaring these same lands d'utilit\u00e9 publique.\n\n46.\n\nAt the request of EGOTH, ETDC was put under judicial trusteeship by a judgment of the Giza Court for Urgent Matters rendered on June 19, 1978. The court appointed trustees who were put in charge of the management of the company's assets until a general meeting of the shareholders could take place.\n\n47.\n\nOn December 7, 1978, SPP and SPP(ME) filed a request for arbitration with the Court of Arbitration of the ICC in Paris against Egypt and EGOTH under the arbitration clause in the December Agreement. Egypt objected to the jurisdiction of the ICC tribunal. In the acte de mission, Egypt and EGOTH stated:\n\nThe FIRST and SECOND DEFENDANTS wish to make it clear that their submission of an ANSWER and COUNTER-CLAIM does not constitute in any way an acceptance of the initiation of this arbitration proceedings. Their refusal of the arbitration proceedings is to remain firm until the Arbitrators render their final decision on the matter of jurisdiction. In case the Arbitrators affirm their jurisdiction over the subject matter at issue, the COUNTER-CLAIM shall be comprised within the said jurisdiction.\n\n48.\n\nThe ICC tribunal, in an award rendered on February 16, 1983, held inter alia :\n\n1. That the first Defendant, the Arab Republic of Egypt, pay to the First Claimant, Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East), Limited the sum of US$12,500,000 (twelve million five hundred thousand) together with interest thereof at the rate of 5% per annum from the date in which the request for arbitration was received by the Secretary of the ICC Court of Arbitration (i.e. 1st December 1978) until payment.\n\n2. That the claim by both Claimants against the second Defendant, the Egyptian General Company for Tourism and Hotels, be dismissed.\n\n3. That the counterclaim by the said second Defendant against the Claimants be dismissed.\n\nIn dismissing the claim against EGOTH, the ICC tribunal added :\n\nDifferent considerations might well apply if the Government had not been a party to the December, 1974 Agreement,\n\n49.\n\nOn March 28, 1983, Egypt appealed the ICC award to the Paris Court of Appeals.\n\n50.\n\nBy a letter dated August 15, 1983, SPP (ME) notified the Minister of Tourism that in its view the ICC award \"is binding between the parties and finally dispositive of our dispute,\" on the basis of Article 24 of the ICC Rules which provides that:\n\nBy submitting the dispute to arbitration by the International Chamber of Commerce, the parties shall be deemed to have undertaken to carry out the resulting award without delay and to have waived their right to any form of appeal insofar as such waiver can validly be made.\n\nAt the same time, SPP(ME) added in its letter of August 15, 1983, that:\n\n...recognizing that your Government has taken the position that the ICC award was rendered without a jurisdictional basis, we hereby notify you that we accept and reserve the opportunity of availing ourselves of the uncontestable jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, under the auspices of the World Bank, which is open to us as a result of Law no. 43 of 1974, Article 8 of which provides that investment disputes may be settled by ICSID arbitration.\n\nSPP(ME) also affirmed that:\n\n...This notification does not affect our reliance on the ICC Award, nor does it constitute a waiver of any rights to have the ICC Award immediately recognized and enforced by judicial procedure.\n\n51.\n\nOn July 12, 1984, prior to the institution of the present proceedings, the Paris Court of Appeals annulled the ICC award on the ground that Egypt was not a party to the December Agreement and therefore was not bound by the ICC arbitration clause therein.\n\n52.\n\nOn November 28, 1984, the Claimants referred the decision of the Paris Court of Appeals to the French Court of Cassation (Pourvoi N\u00b0 84/17-274), requesting that the decision be set aside. This request was rejected by the French Court of Cassation on January 6, 1987. '\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal will now proceed to the consideration of Egypt's remaining objections to the Centre's jurisdiction with respect to the present dispute. According to Article 25, paragraph 1, of the Washington Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre, and hence the competence of the Tribunal, extends to:\n\n...any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre....\n\nThe Claimants contend that Egypt's Law No. 43 Concerning the Investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the Free Zones, enacted in 1974, and specifically Article 8 thereof, constitutes consent to the Centre's jurisdiction in the circumstances of the present case. Egypt, on the other hand, maintains that it has not consented to submit its dispute with the Claimants to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and that the reference to the Washington Convention in Article 8 of Law No. 43 was intended only to inform potential investors that ICSID arbitration is one of a variety of dispute settlement methods that investors may seek to negotiate with Egyptian authorities in appropriate circumstances.\n\n54.\n\nIn its M\u00e9moire of April 30, 1987, Egypt also raised certain questions concerning the Claimants' domicile. Documents filed by the Claimants with their Observations on Respondent's Jurisdictional Memorandum of May 20, 1987, have satisfied the Tribunal that the Claimants are in fact Hong Kong corporations domiciled in Hong Kong, and Egypt's M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9plique of September 25, 1987, makes no further mention of the matter. Hong Kong is a territory for whose international relations the United Kingdom, also a party to the Convention, is responsible, and the United Kingdom has expressly extended the application of the Convention to Hong Kong. Hence, the Claimants are \"nationals of another Contracting State\" within the meaning of Article 25 of the Washington Convention.\n\n55.\n\nBefore considering the text of Article 8 of Law No. 43 and its legal effect in relation to the Washington Convention, the Tribunal will deal with several preliminary matters that have been raised by the Parties. The first of these concerns the applicable law. Egypt maintains that the jurisdictional issues in this case are governed by Egyptian law, either as the law expressly chosen by the Parties (since the Claimants themselves have invoked Law No. 43 to establish Egypt's consent to the Centre's jurisdiction) or by virtue of Article 42(1) of the Convention, which provides in relevant part:\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\nOn the basis of Article 2 of Law No. 43, which provides that any matter not dealt with specifically by that law \"is governed by the laws and regulations in force,\" Egypt argues that the validity of any compromissory clause, as well as the arbitral competence deriving from it, are governed by sections 501 and 502 of the Egyptian Code of Civil Procedure which require a specific and independent compromis or special agreement defining the object of the dispute and naming the arbitrators.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants, on the other hand, argue that Article 42 of the Washington Convention applies only to the substance of the dispute and that jurisdictional issues which involve interpretation of the Washington Convention must be resolved by the application of international law. According to the Claimants, the fact that Egypt's consent is alleged to have taken the form of a legislative provision does not transform the question of whether there has been consent into one of Egyptian law. The Claimants maintain that, from the perspective of international law, municipal law is treated like any other element of factual conduct. In support of this contention, they cite the statement of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the case concerning German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia that:\n\nFrom the standpoint of International Law and of the Court which is its organ, municipal laws are merely facts which express the will and constitute the activities of States, in the same manner as to legal decisions or administrative measures. (P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 7, p.19 (1926).)\n\nThe Claimants also contend that, because the issue in this case is whether Article 8 of Law No. 43 constitutes \"consent in writing\" within the meaning of the Washington Convention -- an international treaty -- Article 8 must be considered in international terms rather than vice versa. On this basis, the Claimants argue that Article 8 should be construed using the rules of interpretation that have been codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n57.\n\nWith respect to the law applicable to the jurisdictional issues in this case, the Tribunal finds that it cannot accept the contentions of either Party, at least in the particular form they have taken. Egypt is correct in its assertion that Law No. 43 is \"applicable\" to the jurisdictional issues in the present case in the sense that Article 8 of Law No. 43 is alleged by the Claimants to constitute Egypt's consent to the Centre's jurisdiction. However, this does not mean that Article 2 of Law No. 43 makes other provisions of Egyptian law -- particularly sections 501 and 502 of the Code of Civil Procedure -- applicable to the jurisdictional issues in the case. Article 2 of Law No. 43 provides for the application of other Egyptian laws in force to \"(a)ny question or matter not provided for by a special provision in the present law...\" If, as contended by the Claimants, Article 8 requires that the present dispute be resolved by the procedures set forth in the Washington Convention, Article 2 by its terms is not applicable and sections 501 and 502 of the Egyptian Code of Civil Procedure, which require inter alia a compromis or special agreement for domestic arbitrations (a requirement that does not appear in the Washington Convention), are irrelevant.\n\n58.\n\nAs to Article 8 itself, the Claimant's contention that this provision of municipal law should be treated as a \"fact\" is not helpful. The Parties are in fundamental disagreement as to what Article 8 means and the Tribunal therefore must interpret Article 8 and determine its legal effect in relation to the Washington Convention.\n\n59.\n\nNor can the Tribunal accept the Claimants\u2019 contention that Article 8 should be interpreted by application of rules of treaty interpretation. Unlike a treaty, Law No. 43 is not the result of negotiations between two or more States, but rather the result of a unilateral act by a single State.\n\n60.\n\nWhile Egypt's interpretation of its own legislation is unquestionably entitled to considerable weight, it cannot control the Tribunal\u2019s decision as to its own competence. The jurisprudence of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice makes clear that a sovereign State\u2019s interpretation of its own unilateral consent to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal is not binding on the tribunal or determinative of jurisdictional issues. (The Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria (Preliminary Objection), P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 77, p. 6 4 (1939); Aegean Sea Continental Shelf, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1978, p. 3.) Indeed, to conclude otherwise would contravene Article 41(1) of the Washington Convention, which provides that:\n\nThe Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\n\n61.\n\nMoreover, the jurisdictional issue in this case involves more than interpretation of municipal legislation. The issue is whether certain unilaterally enacted legislation has created an international obligation under a multilateral treaty. Resolution of this issue involves both statutory interpretation and treaty interpretation. Also, to the extent that Article 8 is alleged to be a unilateral declaration of acceptance of the Centre's jurisdiction, subject to reciprocal acceptance by a national of another Contracting State, the Tribunal must also consider certain aspects of international law governing unilateral juridical acts. This is a subject that has received considerable attention in the jurisprudence of both the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice in connection with declarations under the so-called \"Optional Clause\" of the Courts' statutes. As the International Court of Justice observed in its judgment on jurisdiction in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua case (quoting from its earlier judgment on jurisdiction in the Nuclear Tests cases):\n\nIt is well recognized that declarations made by way of unilateral acts, concerning legal or factual situations, may have the effect of creating legal obligations. Declarations of this kind may be, and often are, very specific. When it is the intention of the State making the declaration that it should become bound according to its terms, that intention confers on the declaration the character of a legal undertaking, the State being thenceforth legally required to follow a course of conduct consistent with the declaration. (I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 418.)\n\nThe issue is whether certain unilaterally enacted legislation has created an international obligation under a multilateral treaty. Resolution of this issue involves both statutory interpretation and treaty interpretation. Also, to the extent that Article 8 is alleged to be a unilateral declaration of acceptance of the Centre's jurisdiction, subject to reciprocal acceptance by a national of another Contracting State, the Tribunal must also consider certain aspects of international law governing unilateral juridical acts. This is a subject that has received considerable attention in the jurisprudence of both the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice in connection with declarations under the so-called \"Optional Clause\" of the Courts\u2019 statutes. As the International Court of Justice observed in its judgment on jurisdiction in the Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua case (quoting from its earlier judgment on jurisdiction in the Nuclear Tests cases):\n\nIt is well recognized that declarations made by way of unilateral acts, concerning legal or factual situations, may have the effect of creating legal obligations. Declarations of this kind may be, and often are, very specific. When it is the intention of the State making the declaration that it should become bound according to its terms, that intention confers on the declaration the character of a legal undertaking, the State being thenceforth legally required to follow a course of conduct consistent with the declaration. (I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 418.)\n\nThus, in deciding whether in the circumstances of the present case Law No. 43 constitutes consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, the Tribunal will apply general principles of statutory interpretation taking into consideration, where appropriate, relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international law applicable to unilateral declarations.\n\n62.\n\nA second preliminary matter involves the question of whether jurisdictional instruments must be interpreted restrictively. It has been repeatedly emphasized on behalf of Egypt in these proceedings that an international tribunal cannot exercise jurisdiction over a sovereign State without its consent. This of course is an uncontroverted principle of general international law. Such consent is expressly required by Article 25 of the Washington Convention and is described as the \"cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\" in the Report of the Executive Directors that accompanied the Convention when it was submitted to the governments of member States of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Preamble of the Convention makes clear that mere ratification of or accession to the Convention is not sufficient to establish consent to the Centre's jurisdiction. Article 25(4) provides that a State's notification to the Centre of the kinds of disputes that it would consider submitting to the Centre's jurisdiction shall not constitute the consent required to confer such jurisdiction. Thus, the consent of the parties to the jurisdiction of the Centre is an indispensable prerequisite to the competence of any ICSID tribunal.\n\n63.\n\nClearly, then, there is no presumption of jurisdiction -- particularly where a sovereign State is involved -- and the Tribunal must examine Egypt's objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre with meticulous care, bearing in mind that jurisdiction in the present case exists only insofar as consent thereto has been given by the Parties. This is not to say, however, that there is a presumption against the conferment of jurisdiction with respect to a sovereign State or that instruments purporting to confer jurisdiction should be interpreted restrictively. Judicial and arbitral bodies have repeatedly pronounced in favour of their own competence where the force of the arguments militating in favor of jurisdiction is preponderant. (E.g., Temple of Preah Vihear (Preliminary Objections), I.C.J. Reports 1961, p.34; Chorzow Factory, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 9, p.32 (1925); Affaire des for\u00eats du Rhodope central (question pr\u00e9alable), R.I.A.A., vol. 3, p.3104, (1931).) Moreover, as the Permanent Court of International Justice observed in the Chorzow Factory case:\n\nThe fact that weighty arguments can be advanced to support the contention that it has no jurisdiction cannot of itself create a doubt calculated to unset its jurisdiction. (P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 9, p.32 (1927).)\n\nThus, jurisdictional instruments are to be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, and jurisdiction will be found to exist if -- but only if -- the force of the arguments militating in favor of it is preponderant.\n\n64.\n\nA final preliminary matter involves the effect on the present case of the French court judgments which annulled the ICC award of February 16, 1983. According to Egypt, these judgments establish that (1) Article 8 of Law No. 43 is not mandatory but merely offers various possible means of dispute settlement to the Parties; (2) there is no hierarchic ranking among the three means of dispute settlement mentioned in the first paragraph of Article 8; and (3) no presumption of a waiver of sovereign immunity from jurisdiction can be inferred from Law No. 43, a fact that proves Article 8 cannot constitute consent to arbitration since such consent would ipso facto entail a waiver of immunity.\n\n65.\n\nWhile the Tribunal is the judge of its own competence under Article 41(1) of the Washington Convention, it should nevertheless give due consideration to the pronouncements of other courts and tribunals which involve the same parties and subject matter as the present dispute. The Tribunal finds, however, that it cannot infer from the French court decisions the particular consequences alleged by Egypt.\n\n66.\n\nThe issue before the Paris Court of Appeals was not whether Article 8. of Law No. 43 is mandatory or hierarchic, but whether the ICC arbitration clause in the December Agreement between EGOTH and SPP was binding upon Egypt. The possibility of ICSID arbitration had not even been raised at the time. While the court made a passing reference to the Washington Convention, it did not purport to interpret the provision in Article 8 of Law No, 43 concerning the jurisdiction of the Centre. Indeed, what the court said was:\n\nQue l'article 8 de cette loi pr\u00e9voit en effet C.I.R.D.I., centre de r\u00e8glement cr\u00e9\u00e9 par la convention de Washington de 1965; que l'article 8, alin\u00e9a 2, am\u00e9nage en outre une proc\u00e9dure facultative d'arbitrage interne dans laquelle la d\u00e9signation du tiers arbitre est confi\u00e9e aux instances judiciaires \u00e9gyptiennes...\n\nThis statement hardly suggests that Article 8 is not mandatory or that the sequence of dispute resolution procedures set forth therein is not hierarchic.\n\n67.\n\nAs to the court's observations concerning sovereign immunity, these were made in the course of a discussion of the Heads of Agreement, which did not contain an arbitration clause, and with specific reference to the December Agreement between SPP and EGOTH, to which Egypt was not a party. The court said:\n\nQu'il ne peut donc s'en d\u00e9duire une quelconque pr\u00e9somption de la renonciation de l'Etat \u00e9gyptien \u00e0 son immunit\u00e9 de juridiction et de son acceptation de se soumettre \u00e0 la clause compromissoire ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans le contrat pass\u00e9 entre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 S.P.P. et EGOTH...\n\nThus, no conclusion as to the effect of Law No. 43 on the Centre's jurisdiction can be reasonably inferred from the the judgment of the Paris Court of Appeals.\n\n68.\n\nNor can any such inference be drawn from the decision of the Court of Cassation. That decision rejected the Claimants' appeal from the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment without discussion of Article 8 or any of the points which Egypt would have the Tribunal infer from the lower court judgment.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to Article 8 of Law No. 43 concerning the Investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the Free Zones, which is the instrument upon which the Claimants rely to establish Egypt's consent to the Centre's jurisdiction in the present case.\n\n70.\n\nThe Convention does not prescribe the form of the consent required to establish the Centre's jurisdiction except to say that it must be \"in writing.\" However, the drafters of the Convention anticipated that a State might give its consent to the Centre's jurisdiction in advance through investment legislation, as explicitly noted in the Report of the Executive Directors that accompanied the Convention :\n\n...a host State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit disputes arising out of certain classes of investments to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and the investor might give his consent by accepting the offer in writing. (ICSID, Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formultion~ of the Convention, vol.ll, part 2, 1069.)\n\nEgypt does not deny that a State may consent to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction in its investment legislation, and indeed acknowledges that certain other States have done so. Egypt contends, however, that Law No. 43, properly interpreted, does not have such an effect.\n\n71.\n\nArticle 8 has been translated into both of the procedural languages agreed upon by the Parties for use in these proceedings. The English text published by Egypt's General Authority for Investment and Free Zones and submitted on behalf of the Claimants, as corrected by the Secretary-General of ICSID, provides:\n\nInvestment disputes in respect of the implementation of the provisions of this Law shall be settled in a manner to be agreed upon with the investor, or within the framework of the agreements in force between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the investor's home country, or within the framework of the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between the State and the nationals of other countries to which Egypt has adhered by virtue of law no. 90 of 1971, where it (i.e the Convention) applies.\n\nDisputes may be settled through arbitration. An Arbitration Board shall be constituted, comprising a member on behalf of each disputing party and a third member acting as chairman to be jointly named by the two said members. Failing agreement on the nomination of the third member within thirty days of the appointment of the second member, the chairman shall be chosen, at the request of either party, by the Supreme Council of Judicial Bodies from among counsellors of the judiciary in the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\nThe Arbitration Board shall lay down its rules of procedure unrestricted by the rules contained in the Civil and Commercial Code of Procedures, save the rules which relate to the basic guarantees and principles of litigation. The Board shall see to it that the dispute is expeditiously resolved. Awards shall be rendered by majority vote and shall be final and binding on both parties and enforceable as any other final judgment. (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe French text of Article 8 submitted to the Tribunal by Egypt provides:\n\nLes contestations ayant trait \u00e0 l'investissement, et concernant la mise en ex\u00e9cution des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente loi sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par le moyen convenu avec l'investisseur, ou dans le cadre des conventions en vigueur entre la R.A.E. et l'Etat de l'investisseur, ou encore dans le cadre de la convention de r\u00e8glement des contestations des investissements entre l'Etat et les citoyens des autres Etats, convention \u00e0 laquelle ~\u00e2 adh\u00e9r\u00e9 \"la R.A.E. en vertu de la loi No 90 de 1971, et ce dans les cas o\u00f9 la dite convention est applicable.\n\nIl pourra \u00eatre convenu que les contestations seront r\u00e9gl\u00e9es par voie d'arbitrage. Ta commission d'arbitrage sera alors compos\u00e9e d'un arbitre pour chacune des parties du diff\u00e9rend et d'un troisi\u00e8me membre, choisi d'un commun accord entre les deux membres susdits. Si les dits membres n'ont pu s'entendre sur le choix du tiers-arbitre dans les trente jours qui suivent la d\u00e9signation du dernier d'entre eux, le choix du tiers-arbitre a lieu, sur la demande de l'une des deux parties, par d\u00e9cision du Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur des Corps Judiciaires parmi les conseillers judiciaires en R.A.E.\n\nLa commission d'arbitrage \u00e9tablit les r\u00e8gles des proc\u00e9dures la concernant, sans \u00eatre li\u00e9e en cela par les r\u00e8gles du Code de Proc\u00e9dure civile et commerciale, sauf celles de ces r\u00e8gles concernant les garanties et principes fondamentaux du recours en justice. La commission devra veiller \u00e0 la c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 du r\u00e8glement des contestations. Elle rend ses d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des voix. Ces d\u00e9cisions sont irr\u00e9vocables, opposables aux parties et ex\u00e9cutoires au m\u00eame titre que les jugements d\u00e9finitifs.\n\nLa commission d'arbitrage d\u00e9signe laquelle des deux parties supportera les frais de l'arbitrage. (Emphasis added.)\n\n72.\n\nIt is contended on behalf of the Claimants that Article 8 of Law No. 43 establishes a mandatory, hierarchic sequence of dispute resolution procedures. In the Claimants' view, if the investor and the Government of Egypt have not agreed on a means of dispute settlement (the first method of dispute resolution mentioned in Article 8), and if there is no applicable bilateral treaty in force between Egypt and the investor's State (the second method of dispute resolution mentioned in Article 8), legal disputes arising directly out of investments must be settled by the procedures specified in the Washington Convention if the investor's State is a party to the Convention. The decisions of the Paris Court of Appeals and the Court of Cassation have established that the Parties did not agree to resolve their dispute by ICC arbitration. The Parties themselves are in agreement that they have not otherwise agreed on a method of dispute resolution and that there is no bilateral treaty which is applicable to their dispute. In such circumstances, according to the Claimants, no further or additional act by Egypt is necessary to constitute the \"consent in writing\" required by Article 25 of the Convention.\n\n73.\n\nFor Egypt\u2019s part, it is contended that Article 8 contains no language expressly consenting to the jurisdiction of the Centre and that on its face the first paragraph of Article 8 is nothing more than a nonlimitative list of possible methods of dispute settlement which may be negotiated by the investor and the Egyptian Government on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, according to Egypt, a separate ad hoc expression of consent is required to establish the jurisdiction of the Centre with respect to the present dispute.\n\n74.\n\nThe starting point in statutory interpretation, as in the interpretation of treaties and unilateral declarations, is the ordinary or grammatical meaning of the terms used. The English text of Article 8 provides explicitly that investment disputes \"shall be settled\" by one of three methods, two of which are not applicable to the present dispute and' the third of which involves the dispute settlement procedures prescribed in the Washington Convention. As the International Court of Justice found in the Constitution of the Maritime Safety Committee case, the words \"shall be\" are on their face mandatory. (I.C.J. Reports 19 60, p. 15 9.)\n\n75.\n\nSimilarly, the French text of the first paragraph of Article 8 provides that disputes sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9es by one of three methods. Although formulated in the present tense, the phrase sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9es clearly has a mandatory character and in the context of Article 8 conveys an obligation to submit disputes to one of three methods of settlement if any of these methods is applicable.\n\n76.\n\nMoreover, in both the English and the French texts of Article 8 there is a clear and significant difference in the verbs used in the first and second paragraphs. While the first paragraph provides in the English text that disputes \"shall be settled\", the second paragraph, which authorizes certain procedures for domestic arbitration if the parties agree to use that method of dispute resolution, provides that disputes \"may be settled.\" Similarly, in the French text, the first paragraph provides that disputes sont r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, whereas the second paragraph provides that il pourra \u00eatre convenu to settle disputes by domestic arbitration. Thus, in both of the procedural languages of the arbitration, the use of contrasting verb forms in close proximity indicates the mandatory nature of the first paragraph of Article 8.\n\n77.\n\nAs to the Arabic text of Article 8, the Claimants have submitted to the Tribunal expert opinions of Arabic scholars and practitioners, including the former President of Egypt's Conseil d'Etat, stating that the Arabic text of the first paragraph of Article 8 is mandatory.\n\n78.\n\nIn its M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9plique of September 25, 1987, Egypt argues that the Arabic text, rather than translations into the procedural languages agreed upon by the Parties, must be used for purposes of determining whether Law No. 43 constitutes consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, and that the translations of Article 8 which have been submitted to the Tribunal do not accurately convey the true sense of the Arabic text. According to Egypt, to translate tatimmu -- the verb used in the first paragraph of Article 8 -- into \"shall be\" settled is to overstate the imperative nature of the Arabic text because the tense of the Arabic verb is present indicative rather than future imperative. Egypt has submitted to the Tribunal a document prepared by specialists at Harvard\u2019s Center for Middle Eastern Studies, which compares and translates the verb forms used in Article 8 with those used in other Egyptian laws as shown below:\n\n[TABLE]\n\nAlthough its own experts translate tatimmu as \"shall/will be effected,\" Egypt contends that these comparisons and translations show that in the Arabic text the verb used in the first paragraph of Article 8 is not as imperative as it could be.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that tatimmu is not the most imperative verb form available in the Arabic language. (Nor, for that matter, is \"shall be\" the most imperative verb form in the English language, although it is nevertheless mandatory.) The first paragraph of Article 8, however, is only mandatory to the extent that any of the three methods of dispute settlement mentioned therein is applicable to a particular dispute. Thus, if the parties to the dispute have not agreed on a method of dispute resolution, if there is no applicable bilateral treaty in force, and if the Washington Convention is not applicable, Article 8 does not mandate dispute settlement. In such circumstances, the dispute will remain unresolved for lack of an agreed-upon method of settlement unless the claimant elects to seek a remedy in the domestic courts. This conditional aspect of Article 8, which qualifies the mandatory nature thereof, fully explains the use of the term tatimmu rather than a more imperative verb form in the first paragraph of Article 8.\n\n80.\n\nIt is also significant that in the Arabic text, as in the English and French texts, the verb form used in the first paragraph of Article 8 is decidedly different -- and more imperative -- than that used in the second paragraph, which authorizes certain procedures in the event that the parties agree to settle their dispute by domestic arbitration. Thus, where the first paragraph of Article 8 uses the term tatimmu, which Egypt's experts translate as \"shall/will be effected,\" the second paragraph uses the term yajuzu, which Egypt's experts translate as \"can/are allowed to be effected.\" As in the English and French texts, the use of these contrasting verb forms in close proximity to one another confirms the mandatory effect of the first paragraph of Article 8.\n\n81.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that the terms tatimmu and \"shall be...\" are used interchangeably in certain treaties concluded in the Arabic and English languages where both texts are equally authoritative. For example, the Treaty between the United States of America and the Arab Republic of Egypt concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments, signed on March 11, 1986, provides in Article VII(2) that:\n\nIn the event of a legal investment dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party with respect to an investment of such national or company in the territory of such Party, the parties shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultation and negotiation. The Parties may, upon the initiative of either of them and as a part of their consultation and negotiation, agree to rely upon non-binding, third-party procedures. If the dispute cannot be resolved through consultation and negotiation, then the dispute shall be submitted for settlement in accordance with the applicable dispute-settlement procedures upon which a Party and national or company of the other Party have previously agreed. With respect to expropriation by either Party, any dispute-settlement procedures specified in an investment agreement between such Party and such national or company shall remain binding and shall be enforceable in accordance with the terms of the investment agreement and relevant provisions of domestic laws of such Party and treaties and other international agreements regarding enforcement of arbitral awards to which such Party has subscribed.\n\nThe English text of Article VII(2) uses the terms \"shall\" or \"shall be\" four times. The corresponding parts of the Arabic text employ three different verbs as required by the particular contexts in which they occur. Where the English text says that disputes \"shall be submitted for settlement,\" the Arabic text of Article VII uses the term tatimmu -- the same term that is used in the first paragraph of Article 8 of Law No. 43.\n\n82.\n\nIn view of the expert opinions concerning the Arabic text submitted on behalf of the Claimants, and of the translations into the procedural languages that have been submitted by both Parties, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Arabic text of the first paragraph of Article 8 mandates the submission of disputes to the various methods prescribed therein where such methods are applicable.\n\n83.\n\nWith respect to the question of priority among the methods of dispute settlement prescribed in Article 8, the particular methods involved and the order in which they are mentioned indicate a hierarchic relationship. Those methods begin with the most specific --- an agreement between the parties as to how the dispute shall be settled -- and proceed to more general bilateral treaties between the investor\u2019s State and Egypt, and then finally to the most general method of dispute settlement -- the multilateral Washington Convention. A specific agreement between the parties to a dispute would naturally take precedence with respect to a bilateral treaty between the investor\u2019s State and Egypt, while such a bilateral treaty would in turn prevail with respect to a multilateral treaty such as the Washington Convention. Article 8 thus reflects the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant -- a principle that has been endorsed by publicists since Grotius (Bk. II, Cap. xvi, sec. xxix(I)) and appears in the jurisprudence of the Permanent Court of International Justice (Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Jurisdiction), Ser. A, No.2, pp. 31-32 (1924)) and various international arbitral tribunals (e.g., Saudi Arabia v. Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), I.L.R., vol. 27, p.117 (1963).\n\n84.\n\nThe hierarchic relationship of the dispute resolution procedures prescribed in Article 8, as well as the mandatory nature of that article, are confirmed by Decree No. 375 of 1977, which was issued in implementation of Law No. 43. The English text of Article 45 of Decree No. 375 published by Egypt's General Authority for Investment and Free Zones and submitted on behalf of the Claimants... provides:.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article 8 of Law 43, investment disputes shall be settled pursuant to the rules and procedures agreed upon with the investor. In the absence of such agreement, such disputes shall be resolved according to rules established by agreements in force between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the investor's home country. If in turn there are no such agreements, disputes between the State and the nationals of other countries are to be settled in accordance with the provisions of the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, to which the Arab Republic of Egypt has adhered pursuant to Law No. 90 of 1971. (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe certified French text of Article 45 of Decree No. 375 submitted by Egypt during the course of these proceedings provides :\n\nSans pr\u00e9judice des dispositions de l'article 8 de la loi, les r\u00e8gles applicables, soit sur le fond soit sur la proc\u00e9dure des litiges concernant l'investissement seront celles contenues dans l'accord conclu avec l'investisseur, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'un accord, sont applicables les r\u00e8gles incluses dans les Conventions en vigueur entre la R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte et l'Etat de l'investisseur, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de convention \u00e0 ce sujet, ce sera en application de la Convention pour le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements entre l'Etat et les ressortissants des autres Etats \u00e0 laquelle la R\u00e9publique Arabe d'Egypte a adh\u00e9r\u00e9 en vertu de la loi n\u00b0 90 de 1971, dans les cas o\u00f9 elle est applicable, (Emphasis added.)\n\nEgypt has drawn the Tribunal's attention to the fact that the English translation of Article 45 prepared by the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones is incorrect in that the first sentence should begin with the phrase, \"Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 8\" instead of the phrase \"In accordance with the provisions of Article 8,\" and the final sentence, after the reference to \"Law No. 90 of 1971,\" should contain the phrase \"where it (the Convention] applies.\"\n\n85.\n\nEgypt does not contest the translations of those parts of Article 45 which indicate the hierarchic relationship of the dispute settlement methods prescribed therein, however. The use of the phrases \"in the absence of such agreement\" and \"if in turn there are no such agreements\" in the English text, and \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019un accord and \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de convention in the French text, clearly indicate a sequential relationship and a descending order of applicability.\n\n86.\n\nArticle 45 of Decree No. 375 also confirms the mandatory nature of the first paragraph of Article 8 of Law No. 8. The English text of Article 45 prepared by the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones, like that of Article 8 itself, provides that disputes \"shall be\" settled by the methods prescribed therein; the French text uses the verb sera. The Arabic text is even more emphatic; it provides alawa id al-wajibat al-tatbiq. As explained in an expert opinion submitted by the Claimants which has not been controverted by Egypt, the word wajibat derives from wujub, which implies a more forceful notion than \"shall be...\" and is more correctly translated as \"must be....\"\n\n87.\n\nIt is true, as Egypt has pointed out, that according to Egyptian constitutional law, implementing regulations such as Decree No. 375 cannot modify or amend the terms of a statute enacted by Parliament, Article 45 of Decree No. 375 does not purport to modify or amend Article 8 of Law No. 43, however. It only makes explicit the hierarchic sequence which results from the nature of the three methods provided for in Article 8 and from the legal principle that establishes the priority of a special rule with respect to a general one, and confirms the mandatory application of those methods which is otherwise indicated by the ordinary meaning of the terms used in Article 8.\n\n88.\n\nAttention has also been called to Article 55 of a prior regulation of Law No. 43, issued by the Prime Minister's Decision No. 91-1975. Article 55 provided that:\n\nSubject to the provisions of Paragraph (one) of Article 8 of Law No. 43 for the year 1974, it may be agreed to settle by arbitration investment disputes related to the implementation of the provisions of the law as well as disputes arising between projects established in the free zones or between these projects and the Authority or other authorities or administrative agencies connected with the activities or operations in the zones.\n\nThe arbitration board may also view disputes that arise between projects established in the free zones and Egyptian or foreign physical or juristic persons when such persons agree to refer the dispute to the arbitration board prior to or after the dispute arises.\n\nThis provision, which concerns domestic arbitration, adds little to what has already been said. It is not disputed that under the first paragraph of Article 8 parties may agree to settle investment disputes by domestic arbitration. The question before the Tribunal, however, is whether Article 8 requires ICSID arbitration in situations where the parties have not agreed on domestic arbitration or some other form of dispute settlement and where there is no applicable bilateral treaty. Article 55 simply does not address ICSID arbitration.\n\n89.\n\nIn support of its argument that the first paragraph of Article 8 is merely a nonlimitative list of dispute settlement methods that investors may seek to negotiate, Egypt contends that the first paragraph cannot be dissociated from the second paragraph, which, according to Egypt, correctly translated begins with the phrase \"One can also...\" or \"Furthermore, one can...\" - However, the second paragraph of Article 8 authorizes certain domestic arbitration procedures not otherwise available under Egyptian law which can be employed if the parties agree to settle disputes by domestic arbitration as authorized by the first paragraph of Article 8 (\"...in a manner to be agreed upon...\"). Hence, the second paragraph of Article 8 does not imply that the first paragraph is not mandatory; rather, it augments the first paragraph by specifying certain procedures that may be used to implement one of the methods of dispute settlement prescribed therein.\n\n90.\n\nNor is the Tribunal able to reconcile the notion that Article 8 is only a list of possible alternatives to be negotiated, none of which is mandatory or binding upon Egyptian authorities without further agreement, with the second method of dispute settlement mentioned in Article 8, viz., settlement pursuant to a bilateral treaty. In circumstances where a bilateral treaty provides for mandatory dispute resolution without further consent or agreement by the parties (as Egypt admits its bilateral treaties with various countries do), Article 8 can hardly be characterized as a mere list of alternatives to be negotiated. Such a construction of Article 8 would in effect deny the investor the right to dispute settlement conferred by the bilateral treaty, in derogation of the principle of pacta sunt servanda. Clearly, the Government of Egypt cannot be presumed to have intended such a result when it enacted Law No. 43.\n\n91.\n\nAlthough the text of Article 8 makes no mention of any separate ad hoc agreement or further manifestation of consent being required to establish consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, Egypt contends that such a requirement is implicit in the phrases \"within the framework of the Convention\" and \"where it [i.e., the Convention] applies.\" Egypt maintains that the \"framework\" of the Washington Convention includes the requirement of a separate, written consent to the Centre's jurisdiction and that the phrase \"where it applies\" reserves the conditions of applicability of the Convention including the requirement of a special agreement to submit to the Centre's jurisdiction. As the Tribunal has already noted, Egypt also points out that the phrase \"where it [the Convention] applies\" was erroneously omitted from the English text of Article 45 of Decree No. 375, although it appears in the French text.\n\n92.\n\nA number of considerations make it impossible for the Tribunal to accept that the phrases \"within the framework of the Convention\" and \"where it applies\" have the effect of introducing into Article 8 an implicit requirement of a further expression of consent in order to establish the Centre's jurisdiction.\n\n93.\n\nFirst, examination of other parts of Law No. 43 reveals that, when the Egyptian Government intended to require separate ad hoc consent for dispute settlement it did so clearly and in explicit terms. Article 45 of Law No. 43, which concerns projects established in \"free zones,\" provides ?\n\nDisputes arising between projects established in free zones, or arising between such projects and the Authority or any other authorities or administrative bodies connected with the business activities within the zone, may be submitted, by agreement, to arbitration,'\n\nAn Arbitration Board shall be constituted to decide on the dispute in' accordance with the rules and pursuant to the measures stipulated in Article 8 hereof.\n\nThe Arbitration Board may also examine disputes arising between projects existing in the free zone and natural or juridical persons, whether indigenous or alien, if such persons agree to refer the dispute to the Arbitration Board beforeor after it arises. (Emphasis added.)\n\nThus, the drafters of Law No. 43 were careful to provide specifically in Article 45 for separate agreement to establish the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Board to settle disputes involving projects in the free zones. Contrasted with the silence of Article 8 with respect to any such separate ad hoc consent to ICSID jurisdiction, the language of Article 45 of Law No. 43 militates against the conclusion that the phrases \"within the. framework of the Convention\" and \"where it applies\" were intended to imply a requirement of separate ad hoc consent to establish the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n94.\n\nTo interpret the phrases \"within the framework of the Convention\" and \"where it applies\" to mean that the parties to an investment dispute must execute a separate agreement to establish consent to the Centre's jurisdiction would also destroy the internal logic of Article 8 and render much of that provision superfluous. If such a separate agreement were required, ICSID arbitration in effect would be subsumed in the first method of settlement prescribed by Article 8, namely, \"a manner to be agreed upon with the investor.\" Such an interpretation of Article 8 would render meaningless' the entire phrase:\n\n...or within the framework of the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between the State and nationals of other countries to which Egypt has adhered by virtue of Law no. 90 of 1971, where it applies.\n\nNo valid method of legal interpretation would warrant the conclusion that the express reference to the Convention in Article 8 is meaningless or pleonastic. Under general principles of statutory interpretation, a legal text should be interpreted in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every word in the text.\n\n95.\n\nEgypt argues that similar reasoning can be applied to the second paragraph of Article 8, since an agreement to submit a dispute to domestic arbitration as provided for in that paragraph also falls within the first method of dispute settlement mentioned in the first paragraph of Article 8 (\"in a manner to be agreed upon\"). However, as Egypt itself has acknowledged in these proceedings, the second paragraph of Article 8 derogates from the rules of Egyptian law applicable to domestic arbitration. Thus, even though the first paragraph of Article 8 authorizes the parties to agree upon domestic arbitration as a means of dispute settlement, the second paragraph is necessary to authorize certain special procedures for domestic arbitration that would not otherwise be available under Egyptian law.\n\n96.\n\nEgypt also argues that the requirement of a separate agreement to establish the Centre's jurisdiction would not render part of Article 8 superfluous because the reference to the Washington Convention has the important legal consequence of informing potential investors of the Egyptian Government's willingness in appropriate circumstances to negotiate an agreement conferring jurisdiction on the Centre. The Tribunal is unable to share' this view. Egypt's willingness in principle to negotiate agreements conferring jurisdiction on the Centre was expressed three years before the enactment of Law No. 43, when Egypt enacted Law No. 90, by which Egypt ratified its adherence to the Washington Convention. Moreover, the provision in Article 8 for dispute settlement \"in a manner to be agreed upon with the investor\" is sufficient to authorize ad hoc consent to the Centre's jurisdiction. In these circumstances the Tribunal cannot accept the contention that Article 8 offered only a promise to negotiate -- a pactum de contrahendo -- by which the parties would undertake to enter into negotiations. Such a promise is devoid of any practical legal effect, since, as the Permanent Court has put it, \"an obligation to negotiate does not imply an obligation to reach agreement.\" (Railway Traffic between Lithuania and Poland, P.C.I.J. Series A/B No. 42, p.116 (1931).)\n\n97.\n\nEgypt next argues that when Article 8 provides for settlement \"within the framework\" of the Convention, it means subject to the conditions established by the Convention for the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Centre, including the requirement of a specific consent. In support of this contention, Egypt has cited certain bilateral investment treaties to which it is a party, such as the treaty of July 15, 1978, with Sweden. This treaty provides that :\n\nIn the event of a dispute arising between a national or a company of one Contracting State and the other Contracting State in connection with an investment on the territory of that other Contracting State, it shall upon the agreement by both parties to the dispute be submitted for arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes established under the Washington Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, dated March 18, 1965. (Emphasis added.)\n\nEgypt argues that, just as Article 8 of Law No. 43 cannot override the requirement of \"agreement by both parties\" in the Swedish treaty, it cannot displace the Convention's requirement of \"consent in writing.\" The question, however, is not whether Article 8 can displace the requirement for a \"consent in writing,\" but whether Article 8 is itself a legally sufficient manifestation such consent,\n\n98.\n\nIt is true that both the Convention and the Swedish treaty require separate manifestations of consent to establish the Centre's jurisdiction. But the Convention and the Swedish treaty articulate this requirement differently: the Convention requires a \"consent in writing\" whereas the Swedish treaty requires \"the agreement by both parties.\" Thus, the \"frameworks\" of the Swedish treaty and the Convention are different. As indicated by the Report of the Executive Directors (paragraph 70, above), the drafters of the Convention, which entered into force eight years prior to the enactment of Article 8, anticipated that a State might unilaterally give advance \"consent in writing\" to the Centre's jurisdiction through investment legislation. On the other hand, such unilateral legislation clearly could not constitute the \"agreement by both parties\" required by the Swedish treaty, which was entered into four years after Article 8 was enacted. The fact that Article 8 of Law No. 43 is not the kind of manifestation of consent envisioned by the framework of the Swedish treaty does not mean that it is not a \"consent in writing\" within the framework of the Convention.\n\n99.\n\nObviously, when a dispute has to be settled \"within the framework\" of a treaty, all of the conditions required by the treaty for its application must be fulfilled. However, the phrase \"within the framework\" does not import into a treaty additional requirements which the treaty does not contain. The Convention makes no mention of a separate ad hoc consent. It says only that there must be \"consent in writing.\"\n\n100.\n\nEqually unacceptable is the argument that the phrase \"where it [i.e., the Convention] applies\" introduces a requirement of separate ad hoc consent into Article 8. The Convention may be invoked in any case involving a dispute between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. Of course, the Centre will not have jurisdiction with respect to all such disputes. Jurisdiction will only exist if the dispute is a legal one that arises directly from an investment and if the parties have consented in writing to the jurisdiction of the Centre. These jurisdictional requirements, however, are prescribed in the Convention itself. Thus, it is by application of the Convention that a tribunal determines whether it is competent to hear a particular case. Considered sensu stricto, then, the Convention -- specifically, Article 25 thereof -- \"applies\" to any case involving a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State for purposes of determining whether the Centre has jurisdiction with respect to the dispute.\n\n101.\n\nFor the dispute settlement provisions of the Convention to apply, it is necessary that the jurisdictional prerequisites of Article 25 be satisfied. Thus, the Convention\u2019s dispute settlement provisions will not apply if the investor is not a national of another Contracting State. Nor will they apply if the dispute is not a legal one or does not arise directly from an investment. With respect to the consent necessary to establish the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction, however, Article 25 requires only that it be \"in writing.\" The Convention does not prescribe any particular form for the consent, nor does it require that consent be given on a case-by-case basis. To the contrary, the drafters of the Convention intended that consent could be given in advance through investment legislation. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot accept the contention that the phrase \"where it applies\" in Article 8 of Law No. 4 3 requires a further or ad hoc manifestation of consent to the Centre's jurisdiction.\n\n102.\n\nEgypt also argues that Article 8 of Law No. 43 is insufficient to express consent to arbitration because Article 8 does not refer expressly to \"arbitration\" but says only that disputes shall be settled \"within the framework of the Convention\" -- a phrase that embraces both arbitration and conciliation. Nowhere, however, does the Washington Convention say that consent to the Centre's jurisdiction must specify whether the consent is for purposes of arbitration or conciliation. Once consent has been given \"to the jurisdiction of the Centre,\" the Convention and its implementing regulations afford the means for making the choice between the two methods of dispute settlement. The Convention leaves that choice to the party instituting the proceedings. In this case, the Claimants have filed a request for arbitration and none of the Parties has asked for conciliation. Consequently, the issue before the Tribunal is whether it is competent to entertain -- within \"the jurisdiction of the Centre\" -- the Claimant's request for arbitration.\n\n103.\n\nCertain bilateral treaties to which Egypt is a party and which Egypt itself has cited as examples of its advance consent to the Centre's jurisdiction confirm that consent to the Centre's jurisdiction need not specify whether it is for purposes of arbitration or conciliation. These treaties either make no reference to arbitration or conciliation, or mention both procedures without distinguishing between them. Thus, Article 7 of the treaty of December 22, 1976, between Egypt and France makes no mention of arbitration or conciliation:\n\nChacune des Parties contractantes accepte de soumettre au Centre international pour le r\u00e8gle ment des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements (C.I.R.D.I.), les diff\u00e9rends qui pourraient l'opposer \u00e0 un ressortissant ou \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'autre Partie contractante.\n\nArticle 8 of the treaty of June 11, 1975, between Egypt and the United Kingdom, refers to \"conciliation or arbitration\" but makes no distinction between these procedures:\n\nEach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as \"the Centre\") for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States....\n\nBoth of these treaties, which Egypt has admitted give advance consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, leave the choice of arbitration or conciliation to be determined by the party instituting proceedings within the framework of the Centre's procedural rules. Accordingly, the Tribunal is unable to accept the contention that, because Law No. 43 does not specify whether it is arbitration or conciliation that is being consented to, a further ad hoc consent is required.\n\n104.\n\nThe legislative history of Law No. 43 adds very little to the foregoing textual analysis of Article 8. In support of their respective interpretations of that article, both Parties have invoked a report on the draft law presented to parliament by a special Joint Committee, which stated :\n\n...Article 8 of the Draft has set forth the means of resolving conflicts brought about by investment and the possibility of agreeing to have recourse to arbitration.\n\nThis statement standing alone is not helpful, one way or the other. There is no indication whether the \"means of resolving conflicts\" are mandatory or not. Nor is the reference to the \"possibility of agreeing to have recourse arbitration\" enlightening, since it appears to be directed to domestic arbitration, which clearly is not mandatory unless the parties have specifically agreed upon this method of dispute settlement.\n\n105.\n\nEgypt contends that the legislative history would have been much more extensive and explicit if Law No. 43 had been intended to effect a \"radical reversal\" of the position stated in the explanatory note that accompanied Law No. 90, by which Egypt ratified its adherence to the Washington Convention. That note stated:\n\n...the submission of disputes to this institution [ICSID] is in no way mandatory but derives from explicit written consent of the State and the investor...\n\nThe explanatory note, however, merely paraphrased the last paragraph of the preamble of the Washington Convention. It was issued three years before the enactment of Law No. 43 and did not exclude the possibility that Egypt might at some time in the future consent in advance to the Centre's jurisdiction, as is evident from the various bilateral treaties subsequently concluded by Egypt which give advance consent to the Centre's jurisdiction.\n\n106.\n\nEgypt in effect relies not on what the legislative history says, but rather or what is left unsaid -- what Egypt refers to as the \"instructive silence\" that accompanied the enactment of Article 8. This silence is explained, however, by the fact that when Law No. 4 3 was enacted Egyptian authorities no longer had to explain or discuss the possibility of giving consent to the Centre's jurisdiction. Thus, in the same year that Egypt enacted Law No. 43 it also entered into a bilateral treaty with France that inter alia gave advance consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, and in subsequent years Egypt entered into similar bilateral treaties with other countries. The \"radical reversal\" of policy occurred not with Law No. 43 so much as with Law No. 90, by which Egypt ratified its adherence to the Washington Convention. By enacting Law No. 90 and becoming a party to the Convention, Egypt represented itself as a State which recognized the validity of the Centre's dispute resolution procedures. This event marked the real change from the policy that had resulted from the capitular system. The subsequent general consent to jurisdiction which occurred later in Law No. 43 and various bilateral treaties merely implemented the fundamental policy change enshrined in Law No. 90.\n\n107.\n\nEgypt has urged that the Tribunal interpret Article 8 with a view to Egypt's historic reluctance to submit to the jurisdiction of international tribunals -- a reluctance born of the capitular system which severely restricted Egypt's sovereign rights to legislate and adjudicate with respect to foreign nationals. It is clear that, in interpreting a unilateral declaration that is alleged to constitute consent by a sovereign State to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal, consideration must be given to the intention of the government at the time it made the declaration. (Anglo Iranian Oil Co., I.C.J. Reports 1951, p.104; Rights of Minorities in Upper Silesia, P.C.I.J., Series A, No.15, p.22 (1928); Phosphates inMorocco, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 74, pp.22-24 (1938)). In this connection, the Tribunal recognizes that in the aftermath of the -capitular system, which was terminated by the Montreaux Convention of 1937, Egypt was understandably adverse to the notion of submitting its disputes or those of its nationals to the jurisdiction of foreign or international tribunals. However, the Tribunal must also consider the fact that in 1971 -- the year in which Egypt became a party to the Washington Convention -- Egypt embarked upon a major new economic policy designed to attract foreign investment. As Egypt itself has acknowledged in these proceedings, Law No. 43 was the legal expression of this \"economic open door policy.\" The purpose of Law No. 4 3 was to promote foreign investment by granting certain guarantees and privileges such as tax exemptions, repatriation of profits and exemption from exchange controls to investments approved by the Government. Law No. 4 3 defined the kinds of investments sought by Egypt and specified the privileges and guarantees to which such investments would be entitled. The incentives and guarantees granted by Law No. 43 were to be enjoyed only by those projects which received the approval of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones, Law No. 43 requires that all applications for investment be submitted for approval to the General Authority, which has discretionary power to refuse such approval. It is not suprising that these guarantees should include the promise of neutral or impartial dispute resolution, so as to dispel investors' concerns about Egypt's reputedly hostile attitude towards non-domestic arbitration -- an attitude which was quite understandable in light of Egypt's experience with the capitular regime. Such considerations would explain why Egypt gave advance and general consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, not only in Article 8 of Law No. 43, but in an increasing number of bilateral treaties.\n\n108.\n\nEgypt next argues that if Article 8 were interpreted so as to give advance consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, it would implicitly abrogate a provision of existing law in contravention of the Egyptian Civil Code. According to Egypt, Law No. 90 of 1971, by which Egypt ratified its adherence to the Washington Convention, made Article 25 of the Convention a \"legal provision\" requiring express written consent to establish the jurisdiction of the Centre. This provision, argues Egypt, cannot be implicitly abrogated without contravening Article 2 of the Egyptian Civil Code which provides:\n\nThe law can only be abrogated by a subsequent law expressly mandating abrogation of the previous law or containing a provision incompatible with that of the old law, or regulatory matter previously governed by the old law.\n\nHowever, if Article 8 is itself the \"consent in writing\" required by Article 25 of the Washington Convention, there can be no question of Article 8 abrogating Article 25.\n\n109.\n\nEgypt argues that the United Kingdom\u2019s unsuccessful attempts in 1983 and 1985 to extend the application of its bilateral investment treaty with Egypt -- which includes a provision for ICSID arbitration and conciliation -- to Hong Kong shows that Egypt did not give advance consent to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction when it enacted Law No. 4 3 in 1974. The Tribunal is unable to share this view, which presupposes that the United Kingdom's motive in trying to extend the treaty's application to Hong Kong was to guarantee investors there the benefits of ICSID dispute settlement procedures which were not otherwise available. In the first place, the bilateral investment treaty between the United Kingdom and Egypt involves much more than ICSID arbitration: it contains provisions dealing with the promotion and protection of investments, most-favoured nation treatment, compensation for losses, expropriation, repatriation of investments, and the settlement of disputes between the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Government of the United Kingdom. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that the United Kingdom's effort to extend the application of this treaty to Hong Kong was motivated by a concern that, absent such an extension, the provisions of the Washington Convention would not apply to disputes between nationals of Hong Kong and Egypt.\n\n110.\n\nNor does the fact that a State enters into a bilateral investment treaty providing inter alia for ICSID arbitration or conciliation imply that the State has not already given advance general consent to the Centre's jurisdiction. Egypt has acknowledged in these proceedings that Senegal's law of April 11, 1974, \"expresses, beyond all doubt, an unambiguous consent\" to the Centre's jurisdiction. Yet subsequent to enacting this legislation, Senegal entered into bilateral treaties providing inter alia for ICSID arbitration with Romania (June 19, 1980), the Netherlands (May 5, 1981), the United States (December 6, 1983) and the United Kingdom (February 9, 1984). Indeed, the article in the Senegal/United Kingdom treaty which provides for the reference of disputes to ICSID is worded exactly the same as the article providing for ICSID arbitration in the bilateral treaty between Egypt and the United Kingdom. Thus, the mere fact that Egypt and the United Kingdom entered into a bilateral investment treaty containing an ICSID clause does not mean that the ICSID remedy was not already available under Egyptian law to nationals of the United Kingdom making investments in Egypt. By the same token, the fact that the United Kingdom sought to extend the treaty's coverage to Hong Kong does not imply that an ICSID remedy was not already available to Hong Kong nationals under Egyptian Law.\n\n111.\n\nBoth Egypt and the Claimants have invoked comparisons of Egypt's Law No. 43 with legislation of other countries in support of their respective contentions concerning the correct interpretation of Law No. 43. The Claimants argue that Law No. 43 is similar to the legislation of other countries which gives advance consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, while Egypt contends that it is very different from such legislation. The Tribunal does not find such comparisons to be particularly helpful or relevant to the interpretation of Article 8 of Law No. 43. To the extent that the Parties cannot agree on which laws constitute advance consent to the Centre's jurisdiction, their respective arguments in effect invite the Tribunal to interpret the laws of States that are not presently before the Tribunal -- a function that the Tribunal considers neither appropriate nor necessary to its decision in this case. Nor do those laws which the Parties agree give advance consent to the Centre's jurisdiction contribute much to the analysis, other than to illustrate the wide variety of forms in which advance consent to the Centre's jurisdiction may be expressed.\n\n112.\n\nBoth Parties have also relied on language in certain official investment promotion literature for purposes of supporting their respective interpretations of Article 8 of Law No. 43. Egypt points out that publications by the General Authority concerning Law No. 43 say that investment disputes \"may be settled\" or \"can be settled\" by alternative means, but do not use the language \"shall be settled.\" For example, the 1975 Investment Guide published by the General Authority states with respect to Law No. 43 that:\n\nDisputes can be settled in accordance with international or bilateral agreements or by a mutually agreed upon arbitration.\n\nIn determining the effect to be accorded this statement and other statements made in promotion investment literature published by the Egyptian Government, the Tribunal must take account of the fact that such statements by their nature are intended to be informative rather than normative. Investment promotion literature does not create rights; it informs potential investors of the rights they will enjoy by virtue of existing law if an investment is made. Hence, the statement in the 1975 Investment Guide that investment disputes \"can be settled\" by various methods -- a statement informing potential investors of the various means of dispute settlement that are available under existing law -- is entirely consistent with the normative provision in Law No. 43 that disputes \"shall be settled\" by certain procedures -- a provision that creates a legal right.\n\n113.\n\nIt is also significant that the statement quoted above from the 1975 Investment Guide uses the phrase \"mutual consent\" with respect to domestic arbitration but not with respect to settlement pursuant to \"international\" agreements such as the Washington Convention. Similarly, the Legal Guide to Investment in Egypt published by the General Authority in 1977 states that submission of disputes to domestic arbitration under Article 8 \"necessitates an agreement by the parties,\" but makes no such statement with respect to the Washington Convention. These explicit references to the requirement of a further agreement in connection with domestic arbitration, contrasted with the silence as to any such requirement in connection with the Washington Convention, further confirm the conclusion that an hoc agreement is not necessary to establish the Centre's jurisdiction.\n\n114.\n\nFinally, in Egypt, the Right Orientation for Your Investment, published by the General Authority in 1984, it is said:\n\nEgypt is a signatory of the International Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes and the right to arbitration of commercial disputes with the Government is recognized by law.\n\nThis statement speaks of a \"right to arbitration\" in connection with the Washington Convention. Again, the clear implication is that no further agreement is necessary to assure access to ICSID procedures: if the foreign investor must negotiate a further ad hoc consent or agreement to arbitrate, he has no \"right to arbitration.\"\n\n115.\n\nWhile there is no question of investment promotion literature altering the terms of a statute, in the present case the materials published by the General Authority merely confirm the conclusion already reached by the Tribunal on the basis of the text of Law No. 43 and the legislative intent thereof to the effect that Article 8 does not require a further ad hoc expression of consent to establish the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n116.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal finds that Article 8 of Law No. 43 establishes a mandatory and hierarchic sequence of dispute settlement procedures, and constitutes an express \"consent in writing\" to the Centre's jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Washington Convention in those cases where there is no other agreed-upon method of dispute settlement and no applicable bilateral treaty.\n\n117.\n\nIn the present case, as a result of the decisions of the French courts nullifying the ICC award of February 16, 1983, it has been established that the Parties have not agreed on a method of dispute resolution. Nor is there any bilateral treaty in force that is applicable to the Parties' dispute. The dispute is a legal one arising directly out of an investment, and the Parties are a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. In these circumstances, and in view of the findings made by the Tribunal in its decision of November 27, 1985, the Tribunal finds that Article 8 of Law No. 43 operates to confer jurisdiction upon the Centre with respect to the Parties' dispute.\n\n118.\n\nIt is true, as Egypt has emphasised in these proceedings, that consent by a State to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal involves a waiver of sovereign immunity. The Tribunal would note, however, that the waiver which results from Article 8 is illusory in several respects. In the first place, because of the hierarchic nature of the first paragraph of Article 8, the Government of Egypt may avoid the Centre's jurisdiction by agreeing with the investor on some other form of dispute settlement. Second, in those cases where a bilateral treaty is applicable, that treaty will take precedence over ICSID arbitration unless it provides for such arbitration, in which case Egypt has already waived its jurisdictional immunity and consented to the Centre's jurisdiction. Finally, Article 8 only becomes operative after the investment has been approved by Egyptian authorities. Thus, even if all of the jurisdictional prerequisites of Article 25 of the Washington Convention are satisfied, Article 8 does not effect a waiver of sovereign immunity unless and until Egypt approves the investment in question without reaching agreement with the investor on some other form of dispute settlement.\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimants have invoked as subsidiary and alternative grounds upon which to found the jurisdiction of the Centre in this case (1) certain treaties entered into between Egypt and the United Kingdom containing most favored nation clauses; (2) an allegation that the Heads of Agreement of September 13, 1974, constitutes an additional expression of consent to the Centre's jurisdiction; and (3) the contention that acceptance of Egypt's refusal to arbitrate would constitute an international denial of justice. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that Article 8 of Law No. 43 is sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of the Centre with respect to the Parties' dispute makes it unnecessary for the Tribunal to pronounce upon these other alleged jurisdictional grounds.\n\n120.\n\nHaving found that Article 8 of Law No. 43 in the circumstances of the present case constitutes \"consent in writing\" to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Washington Convention, the Tribunal must now address the Claimant\u2019s submission that the Tribunal :\n\n...adopt and incorporate as its own the pertinent findings of fact made by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal concerning SPP(ME)'s performance of its obligations under its agreements, the dismissal of EGOTH's counterclaim therein, and the acts bringing about termination of the investment project.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this submission to be unacceptable, both in principle and under the Centre\u2019s Arbitration Rules. In effect, the submission asks the Tribunal to abdicate its fact finding function and adopt as its own the findings of a tribunal that has been held to have acted in excess of the powers conferred upon it by the arbitration clause. Such an approach is hardly consistent with the basic function of evidence in the judicial process, which is to enable the tribunal to determine the truth concerning the conflicting claims of the parties before it.\n\n121.\n\nMoreover, Rule 47 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules requires that ICSID tribunals make their own findings of fact :\n\n(1) The award shall be in writing and shall contain :\n\n\u2026\n\n(g) a statement of the facts as found by the Tribunal... (Emphasis added.)\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will proceed to make its own determination of the facts necessary to render an award in the present case.\n\nFor these reasons\n\nTHE TRIBUNAL DECIDES\n\n(A) To reject the objection to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent alleging that Article 8 of Law No. 43 does not suffice to establish Egypt\u2019s consent to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction;\n\n(B) To reject the submission of the Claimants that the Tribunal adopt and incorporate as its own the pertinent findings- of fact made by the ICC tribunal; and\n\n(C) Consequently, and in accordance with Rules 25 and 41, to instruct the President to fix the time limits for further proceedings on the merits in consultation with the Parties."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "1992-05-20T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Mohamed El Mahdi", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Mohamed El Mahdi\n--------------------------------------\n\n*INTRODUCTION*\n--------------\n\n1.\n\nTo dissent from the award agreed upon and masterly written by such Eminent Jurists constituting the Majority of the present Tribunal is not a decision that can be lightly taken. It is not made easier by the fact that the dissent is not limited to the evaluation of a particular fact or the interpretation of this or that particular rule of law. Indeed the diversions cover altogether the perception of the facts of the present dispute and the evaluation of the whole relationship that tied the Claimants and the Respondent, as well as, necessarily and as a result, the identification and the application of the appropriate rule of the law.\n\n2.\n\nThe starting point of the dissent consists in the perception of the facts. This is due, in my opinion, to the method of approach to these facts; to conceive and evaluate each and every fact as such, in isolation of other facts of the case, as opted for by the Majority Award, or rather evaluate the whole relationship that developed between the parties in the light of the multiplicity of facts forming sequences of their overall relationship. The method of approaching the facts does not constitute, from my point of view, an academic speculation since it is the only overall review of the intricate facts of the case that can best reveal the reality about the effective conduct of the parties during their relationship that took place over the years.\n\n3.\n\nThe overall approach seems, in the present case, to be mandatory since a major allegation advanced by the Respondent and maintained throughout the proceedings before this Tribunal consists in that the Claimants had recourse for their introduction to the Respondent, the obtaining of the approval for their project and during their activities for its implementation to irregular contacts and corruption. To overlook the significance of the sequences of the relationship that developed between the parties, and how that relationship evolved, *inter alia* by vitiated administrative acts as alleged by the Respondent, seems not to be in consistence with the due legal protection of the Respondent\u2019s inherent right of defense. In this case, the *a priori* dismissal of the Respondents contentions as regards the irregularities and/or the nullity of several administrative acts related to and issued for the benefit of the Claimants\u2019 project on the ground that \"the principle of international law which the Tribunal is bound to apply is that which establishes the international responsibilities of States when unauthorized or *ultra vires* acts of officials have been performed by State agents under cover of their official characters\" (the Majority Award p. 32 [p. 352 of this issue]), seems to be, in this specific case where allegations of corruption are advanced, contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s obligation to see to it that the exercise of the right of defense is fully protected to the benefit of the parties in dispute.\n\n4.\n\nWhere dissent is as extensive as I fear it is, in this extremely complex case, an issue of method is to be found. I do not think that the problem can best be solved by following the steps of the Majority Award indicating, point after point, where and why there is dissent. Rather, I propose, to deal with the case in the following order:\n\nI. *Preliminary Observations :*\n\n1. The Jurisdiction of ICSID and the Tribunal\u2019s competence over the present dispute.\n\n2. Guidelines to the settlement of the present dispute:\n\na. The Washington Convention.\n\nb.

The application of the law: the *juris dictio*\n\nI. *Preliminary Observations*\n-----------------------------\n\n1. *The jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal over the present case (a reminder):*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe present Tribunal dealt with the objections, raised by the Arab Republic of Egypt (hereinafter called the Respondent), to the jurisdiction of ICSID and to the Tribunal\u2019s competence, over the present dispute, in two decisions; of November 27, 1985 and of April 14, 1988. The Tribunal finally decided, in the Decision of April 14, 1988 to reject the objections to its jurisdiction and hence decided to proceed to the examination of the subject matter of the case, however, the arguments and findings of the Tribunal in these decisions should be taken into due consideration when dealing with the subject matter of the case. Amongst these findings and arguments which are pertinent to the final adjudication of the present case, I may point out the following:\n\na. In the decision of November 27, 1985 (hereinafter called the first preliminary decision) the Tribunal decided \"A. to stay the present proceedings on the Respondent\u2019s remaining objections to the Center\u2019s jurisdiction until the proceedings in the French Courts have finally resolved the question of whether the Parties agreed to submit their dispute to the jurisdiction of the International Chamber of Commerce.\" This Tribunal founded its decision to stay the proceedings upon the fact that \"... the same question is also sub judice in another forum, where the proceedings involve the same Parties and the same dispute. The ICC Tribunal has already answered this question in the affirmative, holding that Egypt and the Claimants agreed to resolve any disputes by ICC arbitration. The Paris Court of Appeals disagreed, but its decision has been appealed to the Court of Cassation, which will pronounce the final answer of the French judiciary on the matter.\"\n\nAs it was not until January 6, 1987 that the French Court of Cassation issued a decision the effect of which was to finally determine that Egypt had not consented to submit the dispute to the jurisdiction of the ICC, the Claimants did, only on January 29, 1987, file a request with the Present Tribunal asking that the proceedings be resumed. The Present Tribunal admitting, in the above mentioned decision, that \"while the concurrent pursuit of a remedy in different jurisdictions might be justified to protect legitimate interests of a claimant,\" the Tribunal was nevertheless aware of the eventual consequences thereupon since it stated that that entails certain practical problems of international judicial administration \"since it invites a clash between competing exercises of jurisdiction\" (the first Preliminary Decision p. 36). Therefore, three facts and dates are to be borne in mind to wit: that the alleged cancellation of the Claimants\u2019 project at the Pyramids occurred on May-June 1978, and that the present request for arbitration was received by the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter called the Center or ICSID) on August 24, 1984 and that it was due to the Claimants\u2019 concurrent recourse to both the French Courts and to the Center that the Present Tribunal decided to stay the proceedings which were not continued till after the French Court of Cassation rejected the request of the Claimants on January 6, 1987.\n\nb. In its first Preliminary Decision, the Tribunal did not find it necessary to answer the objection raised by Egypt to the effect that Article 8 of Law No. 43, upon which the Claimants rely to establish jurisdiction, is not applicable to the present dispute since the claim is based upon the non-performance of obligations under a contract. In fact, the Tribunal stated that \"it is not necessary, for the purpose of the present decision, to address this question, since Egypt\u2019s objection may be simply answered by a recapitulation *of* certain facts...\" (the first Preliminary Decision p. 27). As a result, the objection remained unanswered by the two preliminary decisions.\n\n2. *Guidelines to the Settlement of the Present Dispute*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\na. The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (hereinafter called the Washington Convention or the Convention) is in fact and in law the prime legal instrument which the Present ICSID Tribunal is to observe and implement, in its letter and spirit. It suffices, for the purpose of this preliminary observation to point out that the consideration upon which the Convention was elaborated, as mentioned in the Preamble of the Convention, is \"the need for international cooperation for economic development and the role of private international investment therein.\" The Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention (hereinafter called the Report) in its turn explains that the *raison d\u2019\u00eatre* of the creation of an institution designed to facilitate the settlement of disputes between States and foreign investors \"can be a major step toward promoting an atmosphere of mutual confidence and *thus stimulating a larger flow of private international capital into those countries which wish to attract it\"* (the Report para 9. Emphasis added). And that the Executive Directors believe that *\"... adherence to the Convention by a country would provide additional inducement and stimulate a larger flow of international investment into its territories, which is the primary purpose of the Convention\"* (the Report para 12. Emphasis added).\n\nThese statements militate for a specific understanding of the notion of investment and the qualification of an investor, in the framework of the Convention. The main characteristic differentiating investors from developers or promoters or the like, seems to reside in the fact of the flow of invested capital, as instrument for economic development, that brings the investor into the host State. It is to be noticed that the scope *rationae materiae* of the jurisdiction of the Center is limited to legal disputes arising direcdy out of an investment between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State (Article 25 of the Convention). Reference to \"investment\" anywhere in the Convention should be accorded the same significance, which consists, as above mentioned, in the flow of international capital to the host State. In the same vein the Egyptian law concerning Arab and foreign investments and free zones, enacted by law No. 43 of 1974, states in article (2) that \"the term \u2018invested capital\u2019 in the application of this law shall be deemed to mean the following: i- Free foreign currency duly transferred to the Arab Republic of Egypt through a Bank registered at the Central Bank of Egypt for utilization and execution or expansion of a project...\" (G. Delaume, le Centre international pour le r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements (CIRDI), Clunet 1982, p. 802-803, where the author states that \"En revanche, d\u2019a\u00fctres l\u00e9gislations proc\u00e8dent \u00e0 une plus ou moins longue \u00e9num\u00e9ration des contributions consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme entrant dans le concept d\u2019investissement\" and cites Law No. 43 of Egypt as an example of the legislations he refers to).\n\nFor the purpose of this preliminary observation, it suffices to point out that \"investment\" means primarily and mainly whether in the framework of the Convention or under the Egyptian Law No. 43 of 1974 the flow of international capital to the host country. The Present Tribunal established in the two preliminary decisions upon jurisdiction that the Claimants applied to the Egyptian Government as investors in the framework of Law No. 43, and that Egypt, as a contracting State to the Washington Convention, embodied in article 8 of the above mentioned Law a standing offer of consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID. Under these circumstances, it appears legitimate to scrutinize the exact effective qualification of the Claimants in the light of the letter and spirit of both the Convention and the Egyptian Law No. 43 of 1974. In the present case, the application presented to the Competent Authority in Egypt; the General Investment Authority, (herein called GIA) under item A: contains information that the \"estimated capital expenditures: imported in foreign currency: 550,000,000.- dollars.\" Under the same item it was written that \"the total estimated expenses for the various constructions on the site amount to five hundred and fifty million dollars during ten years... include (sic) the constructions of hotels providing 15,000 beds.\" (Resp, annex F 17). Then on May 19, 1975, less than one month after the presentation of the application to the GIA, Mr. Gilmour, the Representative of the Claimants sent a letter directly to the President of the Republic of Egypt demanding the approval that the usufruct right be accorded for a duration of 99 years, instead of 50 years, and as justification for that request he stated that that duration \"is a must for such a big sized project which will need a capital of 770 million dollars\" (Resp, annex F 23, p. 25). Consequently on July 20, 1975, the Board of Directors issued Decree No. 50/14-75 approving the establishment of the joint venture Company between SPP and EGOTH for a period of 99 years \"on condition that this matter should conform with the regulations of Law No. 129 of 1947 concerning the obligation of the public utilities...\" (Claimants exh: 105). Needless to state in this context that the advantages that may be accorded to an investment project are always related to the investment\u2019s importance to the host State\u2019s economy and needs. (Ph. Leboulanger, Les contrats entre Et\u00e2ts et entreprises \u00e9trang\u00e8res, 1985, p. 195). In this respect, I may only point out, for the time being, that ample consideration and serious reflection should be accorded to the realities of the present case, and to their due legal significance and qualification in the framework of both the Washington Convention and the Egyptian Law No. 43 since a major argument and serious allegations, concerning the proper legal qualification to be accorded to the activities of the Claimants, are at the core of the present case. In this respect I may quote the Eminent Professor Reuter commenting the Washington Convention as saying \"Toute convention r\u00e9pond \u00e0 un besoin et la question se pose de savoir quelles sont les sources exactes des inqui\u00e9tudes et des refus qui paralysent le d\u00e9veloppement des investissements internationaux. Si c\u2019est vraiment l\u2019absence d\u2019un tiers impartial... mais dans la mesure o\u00f9 il n\u2019en serait pas ainsi son m\u00e9rite n\u2019en serait qu\u2019indirect, elle vaudrait alors, si l\u2019on peut dire, surtout par son fonctionnement, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire par l\u2019occasion qu\u2019elle donnerait *\u00e0 une jurisprudence d\u2019\u00e9laborer et de pr\u00e9ciser les r\u00e8gles de fond sur lesquelles elle garde un silence relatif.* La question ainsi pos\u00e9e *ne fait que souligner toute la diff\u00e9rence qu\u2019il peut y avoir \u00e0 ce point entre l\u2019arbitrage commercial international et le contentieux de l\u2019investissement\".* However, Professor Reuter adds \"Ce n\u2019est pas que dans son ind\u00e9termination la notion d\u2019investissement ne puisse rejoindre celle d\u2019op\u00e9ration commerciale\" (Investissements \u00e9trangers et arbitrage entre Etats et personnes priv\u00e9es, 1969, p. 10-11. Emphasis added). As has been explained, the difficulty to find a legal definition to the notion of investment emanates from the fact that it is, by its origin, an economic notion, nevertheless it is relatively easier to recognize a specific case of investment which is the duty of a Tribunal, than to define the notion itself which is of the domain of the doctrine. In this vein, it has been remarked that \"... avant d\u2019\u00eatre une notion juridique, l\u2019investissement est une notion \u00e9conomique et peut en cons\u00e9quence prendre les formes les plus diverses. Il en r\u00e9sulte que s\u2019il est relativement facile de reconna\u00eetre un investissement, il est plus difficile, voire impossible d\u2019en donner une d\u00e9finition exacte susceptible \u00e0 la fois de couvrir ses multiples aspects et de s\u2019adapter \u00e0 une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique en \u00e9volution constante\" (J.D. Roulet: la Convention du 18 mars 1965, annuaire suisse de droit international, 1965 p. 43).\n\nBefore concluding on this issue, I wish only to draw the attention to the rules of international development law, the genesis of which may be traced to the First United Nations Development Decade (Resolution 1710 (XVI) of December 19, 1961, whereby the General Assembly proclaimed the ten years from 1960 to 1970 to be the first United Nations Development Decade). Whether considered as soft or hard law, the fact remains that the economical philosophy underlying international development law has changed the climate of investment in the developing countries where new ideas and rules are replacing old certainties. An example of this change can be easily detected in the Resolution 1803 (XVII) of the General Assembly where \"appropriate\" compensation in case of nationalization replaced the once established rule of \"prompt, adequate, and effective\" compensation (A. Redfern and M. Hunter, Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration, London 1986, pp. 81 to 84 and Ph. Leboulanger, Les contrats entre Et\u00e2ts et entreprises \u00e9trang\u00e8res, p. 168 et s.,)\n\nb. The standard of morality to which the Present Honorable Tribunal expressed its adherence in conformity with its legal obligation: Reference here is made to the Procedural Order issued by the Honorable Tribunal on February 13, 1991. In my opinion this Order represents a landmark in the international jurisprudence concerning settlement of investment disputes. Although qualified as a Procedural Order, it has its own inherent logic that radiates, by its legal consequences beyond the strict sphere of procedure. As it would be dealt with, at length *infra,* I may only point out that the Claimants in their final conclusions and prayer for relief requested, secondarily, the value of their investment in ETDC on the basis of their out-of-pocket expenses and an additional amount to compensate for loss of the chance on opportunity of making a commercial success of the project. Under item (4) they indicated the sum of 2,254,000.dollars as \"development costs pre-cancellation\" and as supporting document they presented in Exhibit 170 a letter from Coopers and Lybrand dated January 19, 1981 with a summary of SPP (ME)\u2019s development costs for the years 19751979 broken down by categories of expenses. The Respondent for its part stated in its annex F-49 that the investigation of these expenses sheds doubt over the components of the unjustifiable developing costs which were not charged to ETDC and formally requested that the Tribunal order \"une expertise pour v\u00e9rifier la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de ces co\u00fbts et les destinataires r\u00e9els des paiements intervenus.\" Therefore, the Tribunal ordered that \"the Claimants shall submit, within one month, *a document indicating the nature, date and amount of the above referenced development costs, including the names of the recipients of payment in excess of US$20,000* and a confirmation that these sums were legitimately and actually expended for the project.\" (The Procedural Order, para 6-a. Emphasis added). From a legal point of view, the Tribunal had all grounds to refuse a request for payment of sums unless supported by pertinent and conclusive documents on the basis of the well established principle concerning *onus probandi.* As the Tribunal is not empowered to order an injunction to any party to present a proof of any of its contested allegations, this matter being a burden which rests upon the claiming party, the Procedural Order unveils the fact that the Tribunal acquiesced to go forward with, and to scrutinize, the evidence advanced by the Respondent to the effect that the Claimants had recourse, during their activities in Egypt, to irregular contacts and corruption and that the evidence to these allegations resides in what the Claimants call development costs. That is to say that the Procedural Order, requesting the Claimants to produce supporting documents related to the development costs and, especially to unveil the names of recipients of sums exceeding a certain amount, indicates that in the Tribunal\u2019s conviction, the existence of the facts, about illegal expenses alleged by the Respondent, is more probable than their non-existence. Thus, the burden of going forward with the evidence, concerning the allegations of corruptive practices was shifted back to the Claimants with all the legal consequences that that engenders. It remains thus, for the Tribunal, to evaluate the issue in the light of the justifications and comments advanced by both parties.\n\nThe Claimants stated that \"as explained in that affidavit (of *Mr.* Birchall) it was impossible, due to the loss or destruction of accounting documents dating back 15 years to account for every expenditure per category. However, the documents available do confirm the nature of the expenditures beyond any doubt and that they were legitimately made for the investment project.\" (Claimants\u2019 note dated April 20, 1991). To which explanation the Respondent commented that \"En effet, la question des development costs, dont SPP ne demande pas le remboursement en tant que tels, a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par la R.A.E. \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son moyen tir\u00e9 de la corruption\" and that \"Or l\u2019on est oblig\u00e9 de constater qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9pondu par SPP comme cela lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 par le Tribunal: en effet 1. Les r\u00e9ponses sont gravement insuffisantes. 2. Elles contiennent de graves contradictions ou m\u00eame contrev\u00e9rit\u00e9s. 3. Et enfin les explications sont inacceptables.\" The Respondent points out that \"on imagine mal comment dans une affaire aussi importante... SPP aurait pris le risque de d\u00e9truire *les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve* relatifs \u00e0 une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 contest\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque...\" (Respondent\u2019s note dated June 20, 1991, emphasis reproduced). The Respondent in the above mentioned note affirms, moreover, that starting from May 1979 the question of the development costs was under debate and discussion with representatives of Egypt and that at that time Mr. McLellan, a Claimants\u2019 representative, affirmed the existence of the supporting documents as regards the development costs. That fact seems to be later confirmed by Mr. Blainlay from the firm Coopers and Lybrand, who explained in his testimony before this Tribunal that the documents related to the development costs were examined by his firm in preparation to its letter dated january 19, 1981. In this context, for the sake, and in the limits, of this preliminary observation, I express my conviction that the Tribunal should be considered bound by the letter and spirit of its own Procedural Order, in any further determination of the related legal consequences.\n\nc. The notion of World Cultural Heritage and its implication: The uniqueness of the site on which the Claimants\u2019 project was finally intended to be implemented, on the Pyramids\u2019 Plateau proper, and its final registration on the list of properties included in the World Heritage on October 26, 1979 (Resp, annex D 29), mandate to take into consideration this element of \"public international interest or need\" as regards the issue of the present dispute.\n\nIn this context, I may draw the attention to that it was revealed, during the proceedings before this Tribunal, that the maps attached to the only formal agreement entered into with the Claimants by an authorized representative of the Egyptian Government, which is the Agreement of September 23,1974 entitled \"Heads of Agreement,\" indicate the site of the project situated mainly around the Pyramids Plateau. The avatars that occurred later about the change of the site will be explained below in detail, however it seems that the two Parties in dispute do not underestimate the obligation to preserve all and any vestige of the Ancient Civilization on the Pyramids Plateau. By choosing the site of the project on the Pyramids Plateau proper and in the vicinity of the Monuments themselves, those who opted for that choice, instead of the site proposed by the Respondent as shown on the maps attached to the September Heads of Agreement, were necessarily aware of the high risks undertaken. It was in fact and in law a \"contrat \u00e0 grand risque\", with all the consequences that emanate from that *qualification juridique.*\n\nIn fact, the Claimants themselves pointed out that on September 7, 1977, representatives of the Archeological Authority and of ETDC met and came to an agreement with respect to various procedures to be followed to further coordinate and cooperate with each other (Cls Memorial p. 48 and the minutes of the meeting. Cls. exh. 137). The minutes of that meeting, (the Respondent contests nevertheless the correct representation of the Antiquities Authority at that meeting) indicate that it was agreed upon inter aha that \"in the case whereas fixed antiquities are present, such as a complete archeological village or temples... which could not be removed, the Company is bound to leave the area and to eliminate it from the project.\" It seems, therefore, that the Claimants\u2019 explanations in this respect formally confirm the *notion du risque* inherent to their option as regards the site of the project on the Pyramids Plateau proper, and reveal their readiness to comply with any eventual consequence.\n\nThe Antiquities argument will be dealt with later, however, it seems appropriate from the outset to state the following:\n\n- That the Claimants trespassed upon the Antiquities zone of the monuments proper. This fret is revealed by the statement of the Minister of Tourism before the People\u2019s Assembly (that same statement was relied upon by the Claimants, however in another context. Claimants\u2019 exh. 74 p. 45) where the Minister was quoted saying\"... when I took over the Ministry, I found out that the construction is being carried out at a distance of 1,250 meters from the Pyramids, immediately I have issued my order for the cancellation of village No. 24...\"\n\n- That the Claimants\u2019 project, as they conceived and had the intention to implement, would have endangered the existing monuments. This fret is founded upon uncontested technical reports entiled \"Engineering Hazards and Deleterious Effects of the Pyramids Oasis Project on the Existing Monuments.\" (Resp. Annex E 32), \"The Cairo Pyramids site: Anticipated Problems of Site Construction from the Geological Point of View\" and \"Ground Water and Seepage conditions after the Erection of Pyramids Oasis\" (Appendix 1-1 and 1-2 to the said technical report, Resp. Annex E 33 and E 34).\n\n- That it had been established that antiquities were discovered within the Claimants\u2019 zone of activities. The fact which is evidenced by the \"Memorandum sur les Monuments de la R\u00e9gion de Gizeh\", (Resp. Annex F. 35 p. 21) and corroborated by the video tape projected by the Respondent during the Tribunal\u2019s hearings in September 1990.\n\n- That the whole area from the Pyramids of Giza to Dahshur was registered on the list of properties included in the World Heritage on October 26, 1979, in the framework of the Convention concerning the protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (hereinafter called the UNESCO Convention). In fact, Egypt submitted, in February 1979 to the UNESCO its nomination of \"Memphis and its Necropolis - The Pyramids Fields from Giza to Dahshur\" to be registered on the list of the World Heritage Properties. (Cls. exh. 198). It seems unconceivable, in the framework of the UNESCO Convention to endanger vestiges of an Ancient Civilization, already and uncontestedly considered part of the Human Civilization till the site or the monuments in jeopardy be formally listed on the World Heritage List. In the same vein, even the scientific high probability of discovery of ancient vestiges mandates, in the spirit of the Unesco Convention the appropriate measures of protection by the National State acting on behalf of the International Community.\n\nTo conclude on this point, I may express my adherence to Professor\u2019s Kahn statement to the effect that \"l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la Convention de l\u2019UNESCO, outre la reconnaissance de l'existence d\u2019un Patrimoine mondial en tant que cat\u00e9gorie juridique, est de ne pas se contenter d\u2019une d\u00e9claration d\u2019intention mais de mettre en oeuvre un ensemble d\u2019obligations et un syst\u00e8me de gestion qui repose sur trois volets...\" (Resp, annex D 22 p. 14). And for Professor Kahn to conclude that \"actuellement, en dehors de nombreuses conventions sur les atteintes aux droits de l\u2019homme seul exemple certain de *jus cogens,* on ne voit que peu de r\u00e8gles qui puissent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019une telle hauteur dans la hi\u00e9rarchie des sources. Aussi est-ce sans h\u00e9sitation que j\u2019affirme que le respect du patrimoine culturel mondial constitue une r\u00e8gle imp\u00e9rative\". (Resp. Annex D 22 p. 16-17).\n\nProfessor Kahn while expressing reserves as to consider the obligation to preserve the properties belonging to the World Heritage as part of the *jus cogens* affirms however that this obligation constitutes elements of international public ; order \"Mais s\u2019agit-il d\u2019obligations d\u2019ordre public international? Sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 faire appel \u00e0 une notion aussi controvers\u00e9e et floue que celle du *jus cogens,* il me para\u00eet clair que les r\u00e8gles impos\u00e9es aux Etats sont des r\u00e8gles imp\u00e9ratives auxquelles on ne saurait d\u00e9roger: Elles constituent des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019ordre public de la communaut\u00e9 internationale...\" (Resp. Annex D 22 p. 16). In my opinion, I consider that the interest of the International Community as regards its Human Cultural Heritage implied a non codified international obligation binding upon both the International Community and the States even before the entry into force of the Unesco Convention. I may just refer here, in this context, to the fact that when Egypt, in the early sixties, had no alternative but to take the hard and painful decision to sacrifice certain monuments, *inter alia* the temple of Abu Simbel, as an inevitable consequence to the construction of the Aswan Dam, the international community saw to it, financially and technically, that these monuments be protected and preserved. This action, that dates thirty years ago, yet reveals *un \u00e9tat d\u2019esprit* of the International Community behind its strive to preserve its own Cultural Heritage and for the least an international obligation in the making. Originally built into the face of a cliff, the temple was moved to safety 200 meters in land from its original position, the project completed by an international team cut the temple into pieces, carved the entire temple out of the cliff and reconstructed both cliff and temple nearby. The project took 5 years and 40 Million dollars to complete, one of the most ambitious relocation projects, to my knowledge, in history. (Noteworthy in this respect to mention that the Temple of Abu Simbel was, in turn, registered on the list of World Heritage at the same date of the registration of the site of the Pyramids Plateau - Resp. Annex D 29, Unesco, Le patrimoine mondial). *A fortiori,* in case a signatory State to the Unesco Convention identifies a property that responds to the qualifications of the World Heritage Properties, it should be bound to act in accordance to and in compliance with, its obligations emanating from the imperative rule of international law codified by the said Convention. That is to say that it is not by the act of enlistment that a site or a monument acquires its qualification as part of the world heritage.\n\nThe enlistment has in law a declarative nature which does not affect the *nature propre* of the site or monument but formally triggers the *qualification juridique* only under the convention to the said site or monument. The needs and interests of the international community to the preservation of the site from the Pyramids to Dahshur, the actual discoveries of antiquities on that site coupled with the high probability of more discoveries and the Claimants\u2019 apparent encroachment upon antiquities area are, in my opinion, pertinent elements that should be borne in mind. Moreover, as already explained and as will be demonstrated later, the option for the site on the Pyramids Plateau instead of the one initially proposed by the Egyptian administration around the Plateau seems to be impregnated, from the outset by the acceptance of an evident high risk.\n\nII. *A Summary of Pertinent Facts:*\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe facts related to the present dispute were mentioned in the two Preliminary Decisions of this Tribunal, however, in the limits necessitated to pronounce upon ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence over the present dispute.\n\nHence, facts represented, and/or developed by the two parties during the proceedings concerning the subject-matter of the dispute, mandate a more developed and extensive review.\n\nThe main facts presented during the present proceedings relate 1- to the change of the site upon which the Claimants\u2019 project was finally being implemented, 2- to the Claimants\u2019 non-compliance with their obligations in the framework of the rules governing their project (the housing argument), 3- the critical date May-June 1978 and the subsequent conduct of the parties, and 4-facts concerning irregular contacts and corruption allegedly imputed to the Claimants. In the review of these facts, I would nevertheless, state some personal reflections and observations necessitated by the context, without however going through the discussion of the legal consequences thereupon which will be dealt with in the next chapter.\n\n1. *The change of site:*\n------------------------\n\na. The Respondent\u2019s contentions:\n--------------------------------\n\nI.\n\nThe Respondent advances (Counter Memorial Vol I, p. 90) that it was assumed, as a matter of fact, that the site of the project at the Pyramids, as shown in the attached map to the November 23, 1975 contract of incorporation of ETDC (between SPP (ME) and EGOTH, Cls. exh. 113) upon which the master plan report and the other drawings were later prepared, is the one and the same agreed upon with the Government as shown in the attached maps to the Heads of Agreement dated September 23, 1974. The reproductions of the maps attached to the said agreement presented by the Claimants in exhibit (90) s\u00fbtes the Respondent, were misleading since the reproduction consisted of two parts each one containing beside itself a mirror image of the other half of the map superimposed on it. Dissipating any hint of the allegation that the confusion was contrived, the Respondent, however, ascertains that the comparison between these two maps: the one attached to the Heads of Agreement as Annex \u2018A\u2019 delineating the \"sites\" upon which the government undertook to secure title of usufruct to the projected joint venture, and the other map attached to the November 1975 contract of incorporation of the joint venture on which the site of the project was delineated, illustrates the fact that the two sites do not coincide.\n\nII.\n\nRespondent explains (Counter Memorial, pp. 92-93) that the site delineated in the map attached to the September Agreement is in fact composed of four sites mainly outside the Pyramids Plateau and below it, one of which is situated to the south west of the area, bisected by the Fayoum Road (near what has become the new 6th of October city), Respondent adds that even from the most cursory look at the annexed map to the September Heads of Agreement, it appears \"that the main development sites agreed upon fall outside, and below the Plateau, and only a minute site, and possibly one half of another one, very far removed from it, can be said to be at the edge of the Plateau\" (Counter Memorial Vol I, p. 98).\n\nIII.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimants\u2019 intentions concerning the site of the project, and as far back as at the time of signing the Heads of Agreement, departed from the terms of that Agreement they accepted and entered into. As proof to this allegation, the Respondent refers to the content of the Affidavit of Mr. Gilmour presented before the ICC tribunal (Cls. exh. 89) in which he explained the background to the September Heads of Agreement. The Respondent quotes Mr. Gilmour giving an account of his visit to Cairo, accompanied by Mr. Munk during the third week of September 1974, as stating that \"apparently in response to SPP\u2019s concerns about the suitability of the Pyramids Plateau as a development site, General Zaki had encouraged the SPP to consider a development scheme to comprise tourist facilities not only on the Plateau, but also in the area of Mena House Hotel and the \u2018Gateway\u2019 to the Pyramids themselves. Mr. Thomson reported gaining the impression that General Zaki was soliciting SPP to undertake general planning responsibilities for development of major parts of the area entirely surrounding the Pyramids.\" And that \"we abandoned the Egyptian plan, in favor of the fully-integrated, high quality destination resort which we felt uniquely qualified to conceive and implement. The general concept plan we devised for the Pyramids, in contrast, proposed higher density housing on the Plateau grouped in discrete \u2018desert villages\u2019; and in deference to General Zaki\u2019s wishes as we then understood them, we also incorporated plans for tourist development in the area of the Mena House and at the entrance to the Pyramids from Fayoum Road.\" (Counter Memorial, Vol I, pp. 95, 96).\n\nIV.\n\nRespondent explains that, whatever existing divergences between the two parties, it was the site proposed by the Government that had been agreed upon as shown in the attached map to the September Agreement. To the conclusion that the approval of the project by the President of the Republic of Egypt in the meeting held on September 22, 1974 necessarily and logically should be understood in this context, as an approval of the site as demonstrated and delineated in the attached map to the September 23, 1974 agreement.\n\nV.\n\nThe Respondent, also, points out that the December Contract explicitly stipulates in its article 4 that \"ETDC will undertake the development and management of both projects *within the general limits described in the map attached to the Heads of Agreement...*\" (emphasis reproduced), and that article 5 of the same contract provides as follows \"... EGOTH will use its best effort to acquire the tides of property and possession of the land comprising the sites of each project *within the limits referred to in article 4...*\" (emphasis reproduced). The same article provides that \"... provided that they are developed in accordance with approved plans, *but excluding the monument areas* and those which are designated for public use within the project sites.\" (emphasis added)\n\nVI.\n\nThe Respondent explains that, the attached map to the confidential report which is referred to in the December Contract, shows that the sites designated on the map correspond largely to the sites designated in the map attached to September Heads of Agreement. Respondent adds that \"the only divergence... is that the unlawful activity of urban development for wealthy locals... began to show its head in the report...\" (Respondents\u2019 Counter Memorial, Vol I, p. 109)\n\nVII.\n\nRespondent concluded that \"we also know that it was this unlawful change of site to a doubted forbidden area (because it was already partially protected by existing legislation and because that protection had to be reaffirmed and extended as the result of new discoveries and of local and world public opinion pressure) that formally brought the Pyramids Plateau project to an end.\" (Counter-Memorial,Vol I, p. 112)\n\nVIII.\n\nCommenting an inter-office memorandum sent from Mr. Munk, on October 2, 1974 (Cls. exhibit 78) which contained that \"in the light of the above, two unique development areas have been identified by the SPP project team in cooperation with the Egyptian Authorities. The first... consists of some 20,000 acres and is on the immediate outskirts of Cairo... *located on the Giza Plateau and includes the three Pyramids and the Sphinx...*\" (emphasis added.), the Respondent explains that that memorandum dated October 2, 1974, gives more evidence as to the strife of the Claimants to implement their project on the Plateau, in full contradiction to the agreed upon Heads of Agreement and also to the Contract of December 1974 they entered into later on December 12, 1974. (Respondent Counter-Memorial, Vol I, p. 115).\n\nb. The Claimants\u2019 explanations:\n-------------------------------\n\nThe Claimants explain the facts in a different way, to the conclusion that the Respondent\u2019s allegations concerning the site are unfounded. Their presentation is essentially based upon the assertion that \"... The Egyptian Government suggested the Plateau area, that the parties proceeded to discuss and define the area together, and that by January 1975 (at the latest) Egypt had established and all parties were agreed on the location. Details of the location were then refined, discussed, approved, and reapproved in numerous decrees and other official documents.\" (Cls. Reply p. 21)\n\nI.\n\nClaimants point out that the fact that the attached maps to both the Heads of Agreement and to the Confidential Report to the December Contract, show different sites to the one where the project was finally implemented, should be considered in the light of another fact which is that the final site, on top of the Plateau, was clearly shown in the map attached to the Contract of November 23, 1975, entered into by EGOTH and SPP (ME), and aiming to the Constitution of the joint venture ETDC. Claimants add that not only the Head of EGOTH signed the above mentioned contract but that the Minister of Tourism himself affixed his signature to the contract.\n\nII.\n\nDenying any significance to the fact of the change of the site of the project as there do exist several approvals given by the Government to that ultimate site, *inter alia,* the contract of incorporation of ETDC on November 23, 1975, the Claimants, however, explain the change of the site as a change agreed upon by the two parties.\n\nIII.\n\nThe Claimants advance that the precise location of the Pyramids project was *\"under discussion* prior to the formal signing of the Heads of Agreement, *and discussions continued thereafter\"* (Cls. Reply, p. 24. Emphasis reproduced). The Claimants quote the Minister of Tourism as stating, before the People\u2019s Assembly, describing SPP\u2019s visit to the Plateau in July 1974, that \"... to encourage tourist projects in Egypt thus by creating two tourist regions with their complete resort in the Pyramids *Plateau... \"* (Emphasis reproduced).\n\nIV.\n\nClaimants also suggest, on the faith of testimonies of Mr. Grierson before the ICC Tribunal and of the written statement by Mr. Walker, PPA\u2019s Chief Planner from mid 1974 to early 1975 that all allegations advanced by the Respondent in this respect should be dismissed. In that written statement, the Claimants point out, Mr. Walker explains that \"The suggestion that the site of the project was changed surreptitiously is completely wrong and quite ridiculous.\" (Cls. exh. 175)\n\nV.\n\nClaimants explain that on the same day, the December 12, 1974 contract was executed, the Ministry of Tourism issued a decree (No. 356) forming a committee, one of the fonctions of which was \"to specialize in the study of the propositions submitted by SPP in connection with the construction of a tourist city in the Pyramids area.\" (Cls. Reply, p. 30). The Claimants also point out that the above mentioned Committee called itself \"The Pyramid Plateau Committee.\" (Cls exh. 126, concerning the \"Report of the Pyramids Plateau Project Committee\")\n\nVI.\n\nClaimants, however, rely mainly upon the issuance of Presidential Decree No. 475 of May 22, 1975 and also upon the memorandum preceding that decree and presented by the Minister of Tourism. Claimants point out that the memorandum contains reference that the site to be allocated to touristic use in the framework of the September Agreement lays on private land and on the Pyramids Plateau (Cls. Reply, p. 35), and that the Presidential Decree provides in article (1) the allocation of the land \"on each of the Plateau of the Pyramids and Ras el Hekma...\" to touristic use. Consequently the Claimants assert that the choice of the site on the Plateau was mutually agreed upon by the Parties.\n\nVII.\n\nAs additional proof the Claimants refer to the letter and the attached map sent on February 2, 1976 to the Chairman of EGOTH, by the Vice-Minister in charge of Survey Services and Expropriation, the comment, in Arabic, written on the map reads as follows \"(1) that encircled in red on the plan is the Pyramids Plateau site, object of the Presidential Decree of 1975 attributing this Plateau to EGOTH (Ministry of Tourism) for touristic exploitation. Area: 10,000 feddans. (2) That part encircled in blue on the plan and represented by the letter C is the site reserved for ETDC in implementation of Decree No. 212 of 1975 of the Ministry of Economics and Economic Cooperation. Area: 4,000 feddans\" (Cls Reply, p. 39 and exh: 187). That map, as Claimants point out was transmitted by the Chairman of EGOTH to Mr. D. Gilmour on February 1976 with a note saying that \"these 4,000 acres form a part of the overall 10,000 acres area transferred to EGOTH under Presidential Decree 475 1975.\" (Cls. exh: 108)\n\nVIII.\n\nIn execution of the December Contract, as the Claimants assert, four committees, representing EGOTH, the Pyramids Plateau Committee, ETDC and the Giza Survey Department, visited the area between February 16 and 21, 1976 and physically marked it, preparatory to its formal delivery to ETDC from EGOTH: \"owner of the said site pursuant to the Presidential Decree No. 475/1975...\" (Cls. Reply, p. 39 and exh: 188).\n\nIX.\n\nFinally the Claimants refer to the answer of the Minister of Tourism before the People\u2019s Assembly where the Minister said that \"... The project is situated south of the Pyramids of Giza... The Antiquities Authority participated in the joint committees which studied the Project located in the Governorate of Giza (Pyramids Plateau). The Antiquities Authority approved use of this Tourist site and transferred the site to EGOTH in accordance with Presidential Decree 475 for the year 1975, authorizing the allocation of the lands situated on the Plateau for the purpose of tourist development.\" (Cls. Reply, p. 41 and exh: 87)\n\nc. Personal observations:\n-------------------------\n\nI.\n\nThere is no doubt, as well as it is not argued by the Parties, that the ultimate site of the project, on the Plateau proper, differs from the site shown in both the attached map to the September Heads of Agreement and to the attached map to the Confidential Report referred to in the December Contract.\n\nII.\n\nThe attached maps to the Presidential Decree No. 475 of 1975, on which the lands allocated to EGOTH for touristic use were to be shown had not been published with the said Decree as testified by the competent authority (Respondent exh: F14). The Presidential Decree however, does not contain explicit, indications as to the precise site allocated to EGOTH since it simply refers to the contours shown in the attached maps. Claimants assert, however, that these maps existed. They say that \"These maps were apparently in existence. They are mentioned here, in the Decree itself and by SPP\u2019s lawyer in a telex at the time.\" (Cls. Reply, p. 35 and exh: 100).\n\nIII.\n\nHowever, doubt emanates from the fact that in the two memorandums executed by EGOTH for the demand for the issuance of a Presidential Decree allocating lands to touristic exploitation in execution of the provisions of the Heads of Agreement it was stated that \"... draft decree was prepared by the Organization (i.e. EGOTH) and was sent to the Ministry of Tourism on March 15, 1975 in the form of two separate draft decrees, each project being the subject of an autonomous decree and each accompanied by an explanatory memorandum where it was stated that the areas of the two projects lay *in the land which was part of the public domain of the state.\"* (Resp, exh: F.23, p. 21, The Report of the Experts Committee Charged With the Study of the Pyramids Plateau Project. Emphasis added). On the other hand, the memorandum presented by the Minister of Tourism to the President of the Republic for the issuance of a decree to the effect of allocating the lands to the project, in appliance to the Heads of Agreement, states that the lands affected to both the projects, at the Pyramids and Ras el Hekma lay in the private domain of the state. (Resp, exh: F.14. in Arabic). This remark is corroborated by the report of the Expert Committee, (p. 22 of the Report).\n\nIt is noteworthy that, besides the fact that while the Memorandum prepared by EGOTH mentioned that the lands requested to be allocated to the project lay in the public domain (Antiquities), the Memorandum prepared by the Minister of Tourism and presented for the issuance of the necessary Presidential Decree stated that the lands lay in the private domain of the state.\n\nNeither memorandum mentioned or alluded to any change of the site shown on the maps entitled \"Master Plan\" attached to the September Agreement to which the Government of Egypt, duly represented by the Minister of Tourism, formally entered into with SPP. The question remains unanswered about the reason of the discrepancy existing between the two memorandum, of EGOTH and of the Minister of Tourism, the former stating that the lands lay in the public domain (Antiquities) and the latter stating that the lands lay in the private domain of the state. The fact remains that nowhere there was any allusion to the change of the site as shown in the \"Master Plan\" map attached to the September Heads of Agreement. It seems also important to point out that the Minister of Tourism stated in his written submission to the People\u2019s Assembly of September 10, 1977, that \"the Antiquities Authorities approved use of this tourist site, and transferred the site to EGOTH in accordance with presidential decree 475 for the year 1975...\" (Cls. exh. 87, p. 20). This statement gives ample evidence to the effect that the memorandum of the Minister of Tourism for the issuance of Presidential Decree 475 was incorrect and misleading since it contained information that the lands were part of the private domain of the state in contradiction to what he later stated in the above mentioned written submission in which he affirmed that the land was under the authority of Antiquities, and as such is considered part of the public domain, and was transferred from that authority to EGOTH.\n\nIV.\n\nThe two parties presented translations in the English and the French languages to the Presidential Decree No. 475 of 1975: The Claimants presented, in this arbitration, a translation in English of the said Decree which reads as follows \"Article (1): To specify the use of the land on the Pyramids site and Ras el Hekma site which are clearly defined as regards boundaries in the two maps and the attached memorandum for tourist purposes...\" (Cls. exh: 25 and exh: 106). The Respondent also presented a French translation of the same Decree which reads as follows \"D\u2019effectuer \u00e0 usage touristique les terrains situ\u00e9s sur le site des Pyramides...\"\n\nV.\n\nThe fact is that the Arabie text of the Presidential Decree No. 475 of 1975 provides, in a more accurate translation, that \"The allocation of the lands situated on both: the Pyramids Plateau (In Arabic: \u2018A1 Wakia ala koi min Hadabat al ahram...\u2019) (Resp, exh: F.14, page 437 of the official journal: No. 23 of june 5, 1975, and Resp, exh: 16)\n\nVI.\n\nThe text of the Presidential Decree No. 475 of 1975, thus, may be argued to be evidence suggesting that the Egyptian Administration has approved the implementation of the project on the Plateau, however, as will be explained later in this opinion, the Decree by itself does but allocate the land to EGOTH and cannot therefore legally confer *per se* a tight to the Claimants nor be construed as evidence to the effect of a departure from or a modification to the September Heads of Agreement by the Egyptian Government.\n\nThe Claimants on their part assert that the maps attached to the above mentioned Decree existed, nevertheless these maps were never presented by either party. It is established that the registration of the rights of the use of the lands to EGOTH was effectuated without any indication, whether in the Presidential Decree or in any other document, as to the precise location and contours of the lands subject to that registration. (Resp. Annex: FI 6). In the registration act it was thus precised that the accuracy of the description of the lands and their contours rests upon EGOTH without any responsibility engaging the Registration Authority. (In Arabic: Doon mas\u2019 ouliat al Shahr al Akary haliyan aw moustakbalan). It is noteworthy in this respect, to point out that the registration act, explicidy mentions that the identification of the lands was effectuated by EGOTH, and under its responsibility. Had the maps been presented, the Registration Authority would have been obliged to verify by itself the exact location of the land and its contours. (Resp. Annex: F.16, p. 5)\n\nHowever, the multiplicity of the misfortune of the Egyptian Administration may require a careful attention in later developments.\n\nVII.\n\nIt can be argued that the Egyptian Administration for the least did not react to that *fait accompli* concerning the implementation of the project in the determined site on which it was finally undertaken; a conclusion which may be corroborated by the fact that a new Minister of Tourism later stated before the People\u2019s Assembly that \"... When I took over the Ministry I found out that the construction is being carried out at a distance of 1,250 meters from the Pyramids, immediately I have issued my order for the cancellation of village No. 24 and made the construction to be at a distance of two kilometers of the Pyramids.\" (Cls. exh: 74, the Transcript of Proceedings of the People\u2019s Assembly of February 7, 1978, p. 45)\n\nVIII.\n\nNevertheless, it seems surprising that the Claimants, with all their international business experience, did neglect, to point out in the basic document of agreement they entered into with the Egyptian Government (the September Heads of Agreement), specifically and clearly, that the attached maps to the Agreement do but indicate a location which is a preliminary one according to their contentions in this respect. In the early stages of the proceedings before this Tribunal, the change of the site was not brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention. Moreover, the Claimants were not reluctant to stress upon the fact that all high officials of Egypt approved the project and that even the President Sadat gave on September 22, 1974 his \"unqualified approval\" to the project when presented to him, at that date, by the representative of SPP. From the unveiled facts it became certain that, at least at that date, President Sadat could have never agreed upon the location of site on the Plateau since the Maps attached to the September Heads of Agreement, signed the very next day, show the site mainly *around* and not *on* the Plateau. It is also intriguing that the December Contract refers to the site shown in the attached maps to the Heads of Agreement. And then, the December Contract refers also to a Confidential Report which contains reference to an attached map which in turn shows the site on a different location. And later on, the site is shown in a complete different conception on the maps attached to the act of incorporation of the ETDC, dated November 23, 1975.\n\nThis fact, put together with the manifest derogation by the administration to the established rules mainly in not publishing the maps, if they ever existed, and the registration of the right of usufruct upon a determined site with specific contours without any available indication, whatsoever, as to their correctness or exactitude, shades doubts about the whole process of the determination of the site of the project on the Plateau Proper. In this context, I may point out that the statement of the Minister of Tourism before the People\u2019s Assembly (Relied upon by the Claimants: Cls. exh: 74, p. 45) contained information that \"This is what it concerns the region (A). Referring to the region (B) of which the member has said, that the construction is carried out in it without asking the opinion of the Antiquities Authorities, *in fact this had happened before I have taken over the Ministry.\"* (Emphasis added). The above mentioned statement of the new Minister of Tourism, relied upon by the Claimants, reveals at least two facts:\n\n- That the Claimants in region (B) did not comply with their obligations to first ask permission of the Antiquities Authority before beginning the works. The requirement to obtain permission confirms the Claimants\u2019 cognizance of the nature of the site and reveal their acceptance of any inherent risks tied to the specific nature of the site.\n\n- That the new minister was in his statement trying to evade the responsibility incumbent upon himself as Minister of Tourism, and by the same, simultaneously asserted the non-compliance of the Claimants with their obligations, in this respect, as regards the preservation of Antiquities, and the default incumbent the Ministry of Tourism in the exercise of its administrative duties as regards the enforcement of rules binding the Claimants.\n\nIt is noteworthy to point out that the memorandum presented by the said former Minister of Tourism to the President of the Republic with the draft of the Decree (which was issued finally under No. 475/1975) contained misleading information: ascertaining, contrary to the memorandum prepared by EGOTH, that the lands on the Plateau are in the private domain of the state.\n\nIX.\n\nIf the Claimants cannot be held, in principle, responsible for the malfunction of the Egyptian Administration and its manifest aberrant attitude, their own attitude, being the experienced world-wide business organizations as they affirm and as it appears from the documents they presented to that effect, put together with the Administration\u2019s manifest failure to abide by the basic provisions of its elementary obligations as regards the Claimants activities, need more than careful attention and thorough consideration.\n\nX.\n\nIn this context, I suggest a careful reading of the report of the expert committee (Resp, exh: F23). The report, in fact, contains a review of the stages of negotiations between the two parties.\n\nConcerning the issue of the site I may only point out the following telling facts:\n\n- \"On March 8, 1974, a number of responsible personnel from the Egyptian General Organization for Tourism and Hotels met with representatives of a foreign investment group, who declared that the said group wishes *to invest big amounts of money in Egypt in the field of tourism and Hotels* which could *reach up to 1000 millions dollars.\"* (The Report, p. 8. Emphasis added)\n\n- \"On September 22,1974 the first Deputy of the Prime Minister met with the representatives of the said company... on the same date the President of the Republic, who was the Prime Minister in the same time, met the SPP representatives... in this meeting, a number of principles was agreed upon as follows:\n\na) A joint venture shall be incorporated... The first of the company\u2019s business shall be the construction of a touristic area at Ras el Hekma... and another *area around the Pyramids Plateau in Giza...*\n\nb) The company shall prepare the general plan of the projects and present it to the state authorities to be certified. The company shall execute *the whole project at its own expenses.\"* (The Report, p. 11. Emphasis added). From the facts, one may safely conclude that the framework of the Claimants\u2019 propositions consisted in the possibility of investment up to one billion dollars (in a developing country just emerging from a state of war and trying to find its path from a socialist, controlled economy to a free market economy, encouraging, among other methods, foreign investments) and that the location agreed upon, with the highest officials, was around the Pyramids Plateau. In fact, the attached map to the Heads of Agreement of September 23, 1974 confirms this conclusion. It is noteworthy to mention that the attached map to the Heads of Agreement bears the title of \"*Master Plan\",* and that the same Heads of Agreement contains a provision to the effect that \"each complex will be developed according to a *detailed Master Plan...*\" (Article 3). It can therefore be assumed that the detailed Master Plan concerning the development of the complexes should be in the location already determined in the *\"Master Plan\"* attached to the Heads of Agreement. In this context, the arguments presented by the Claimants to the effect that the Minister of Tourism approved the Master Plan by April 1976, and that a certain committee was formed by Decree of the Minister of Tourism consecutive to the contract of December, which called itself the Pyramids Plateau Committee, necessitates a certain reflection: The map attached to the Confidential Report, which was itself attached to the Contract of December shows that the lands proposed to the implementation of the project do not lay squarely and mainly on top of the Plateau. The appellation of the Committee formed by the Minister of Tourism\u2019s Decree No. 356 of 1974 (issued December 12, 1974, the same day the Contract between EGOTH and SPP was entered into. Cls. exh:96) the Pyramids Plateau Committee, if happened, is not evidence that the site was not determined by the Parties to that Contract. In fret, a review of that Decree reveals that article (1) provides for that the Committee was entrusted with \"the study of the proposition *submitted* by SPP in connection with the construction of a tourist city *in the Pyramids area...*\" (emphasis added). So it is evident that the Committee was entrusted to study the proposition *\"submitted\"* and in *\"the Pyramids area\".* On the other hand what was attributed to the Minister of Tourism, on the frith of the September Agreement, which he signed in his capacity as the Government Representative, was to supervise implementation of the Heads of Agreement, article (3) of which provides that \"Each complex will be developed according to a detailed Master Plan prepared and submitted by SPP... *In accordance with and as shown in the attached maps...\"* (Cls. exh: 3. Emphasis added). The Master Plan of the whole project is in fact and in law the map attached to the September Heads of Agreement which bears the title \"Master Plan.\" Any corrective Plans or other detailed Master Plans were to be respectful of the, I may say, *\"The Master Plan,\"* agreed upon by a representative of the Egyptian Government and the Claimants. It would have not escaped the Claimants, experienced as they are, to indicate, if they had any doubt, that *the site* was not yet finally determined by the Parties. More, if it happened that the change of the site was agreed upon in later stages, no agreement was entered into to this effect by a representative of the Egyptian Government. Both the December Contract and the Act of Incorporation of the joint venture ETDC was entered into by the Claimants and EGOTH. Any equivocal language in their provisions, departing from the clear language of the Heads of Agreement entered into by an authorized representative of the Egyptian Government, seems to be, from the outset, the responsibility of those who entered into these agreements. In this context, I may add that the allocation of the lands on the Pyramids Plateau to EGOTH by Presidential Decree No. 475 of 1975, does not indicate by itself the formal approval of the Egyptian Government to the effect that the project be implemented on the plateau proper: because the referred to Presidential Decree did not contain any indication as to the delineation of the contours of the land, and because the allocation the lands on the Pyramids Plateau, to EGOTH does not indicate *per se* the departure from the site already agreed upon and delineated on the maps attached to the Heads of Agreement agreed upon by the Egyptian Government. The fact is that the said Decree did not contain any mention or allusion to the effect that the allocation of the land to EGOTH for touristic purposes was to benefit the Claimants of a right exceeding what had been agreed upon in the Heads of Agreement. This may be corroborated by the fact that the Memorandum presented by the Minister of tourism to the President of the Republic for the issuance of the necessary decree allocating the land to EGOTH did not contain any hint or allusion to the change of the site other than the one as shown in the attached maps to the Heads of Agreement. Had the change of the site *arguendo* been intentionally agreed upon, in later stages, by the Minister of Tourism, it would not have escaped the Ministry of Tourism to mention this important modification to the Heads of Agreement to the President of the Republic, since as above mentioned, he had been involved, in his capacity as Prime Minister, in the making of the Heads of Agreement. Lacking any intention to the effect of the modification of the provisions of the Heads of Agreement, the Presidential Decree 475 of 1975 could not have the effect of an acquiescence to the change of the site. As apparent from the Heads of Agreement the provision concerning the site as shown on the attached maps would have had necessitated, for its amendment or modification *a post act* of the same strength and authority, to wit an agreement entered into by a representative of the Egyptian Government.\n\nYet, if a *fait accompli* consisting in the implementation of the project on the Plateau was established, the process is not clear, and the Claimants are, in my opinion, at least partially, if not mainly, responsible: How can they enter into a binding agreement (the September Heads of Agreement) and affix their signature on a map (the Master Plan) at a time they allege that discussions were underway as regards the location of the site? And how it happened that the exact location, once determined, was not clearly embodied in a document amending the September Heads of Agreement? And finally why the change, or more precisely the changes, of the site were not clearly embodied in agreements with the officials they already treated with? That is to say by authorized representatives of the Egyptian Government? It is noteworthy that all the changes in the site happened to be incorporated in annexed documents; to the Confidential Report (which was itself annexed to the December Contract) and to the act of incorporation of ETDC. The two above mentioned documents were entered into by EGOTH, and the government was not a party to either. Consequently, a special attention should be focused upon the fact that even the act of incorporation of ETDC itself, does not provide for any reference to the effect that the site lays on top of the Plateau: article (3) of that act provides as follows \"The objects of the Company: 1- to develop international tourism *in the Pyramids* and Ras el Hekma sites *within the limits of the approved Master Plan...\"* (Cls. exh: 5. Emphasis added). No doubt that the plain clear language of that article speaks about.\n\na. *A site in the Pyramids*\n\nand b. *That the site is within the limits of the approved Master Plan*\n\nTo the date of incorporation of ETDC, the only approved Master Plan was the map attached to the September Heads of Agreement. Thus, legally and logically speaking, that reference cannot be construed but as reference to that approved Master Plan, or at the least to the map attached to the Confidential Report which was attached, in turn, to the December Contract. However, the map attached to the said act of incorporation of ETDC shows a radically different site. In these circumstances, I may only express my perplexity as to the standard of law, logic or ethics by which one can evaluate the fact of stating something in the text of an agreement in clear and unequivocal language, and to annex a map, showing a completely different location, to the same agreement. The discrepancies between the clear language of an agreement and the maps attached to the one and same agreement raise questions of law, especially in public international law, where the weight to be accorded to maps are debated. However, without going through the issue of law as regards the facts of the present case, it would have been the propice time for the Claimants, and for EGOTH, to include in the text of the act of incorporation of ETDC and in a clear language, their mutual consent, and/or eventually any approval emanating from the authorized representatives, to the effect of the change of the site. On the contrary the two Parties to that act of incorporation refer blatantly to the approved Master Plan (which is, as explained, the map attached to the September Heads of Agreement) and the Parties to that act of incorporation reaffirmed their adherence to its limits. The following question may rise: why the Parties to the act of incorporation of ETDC were intentionally referring to the approved Master Plan, while affixing their signature upon a map which shows the site on a different location? Another question may also need an answer: were the Claimants and EGOTH so badly legally advised as to sign a document containing so manifest contradiction? One should, however, notice that the Claimants are experienced international developers, always advised and seconded, as evidenced in the present case, by eminent Jurists. Beyond any legal consideration, it seems that the parties to both the Contract of December 1974 and the Act of Incorporation of ETDC, by their conduct, took the risk of engaging themselves to obligations, as regards the site of the Project, falling outside the framework of the September Heads of Agreement within which the Egyptian Government, duly represented, engaged itself only to it.\n\nIn this context, I may only refer, without any comment, to the content of two documents:\n\na- The inter-office memoranda dated August 28, 1975, that is before the incorporation of ETDC which occurred in November 1975. (Resp. Annex F.10) sent to the SPP executive committee by Mr. Munk, a representative of the Claimants in which he states \"in the line with the above stated priorities, we should forgo any current effort to obtain project financing... the deal appears so attractive that these potential prospects may go back to the Egyptians and try to get the deal for themselves,! *by offering suitable incentives to someone like Zaki (which would still be cheaper to them than having to buy into SPP\u2019s deal)...\"* (Resp. Annex F.10, p. 4. Emphasis added). The Mr. X referred to in that memoranda happened to be the Head of EGOTH, who entered into, by his capacity, the act of incorporation of ETDC with the Claimants.\n\nb- The Affidavit of Mr. Gilmour, the representatives of the Claimants, presented during the ICC proceedings and referred in the present case, where he stated that *\"we abandoned the Egyptian plan,* in favor of the fully-integrated high quality destination resort which we felt uniquely qualified to conceive and implement. *The general concept plan we devised for the Pyramids, in contrast, proposed higher density housing on the Plateau* grouped in discreet \"desert-villages;\" *and in deference to General Zaki\u2019s wishes* as we then understood them, *we also incorporated plans for tourist development in the area of the Mena House at the entrance to the Pyramids from Fayoum Road.\"* (Cls. exh. 89, Emphasis Added)\n\nIn the light of the above mentioned facts, even the act of incorporation of ETDC does not reveal the Government\u2019s approval of the change of the site, and contradicts by its clear terms the allegation that the authorized representatives of the Government of Egypt participated in the process of that change. It is worth noting that the Claimants, throughout the proceedings before this Tribunal, did not explain why the act of incorporation of ETDC refers to the \"approved Master Plan\" since the parties to that act departed, allegedly with the consent of the Government, from the same *\"approved Master Plan\" ?*\n\nIt is clear that a *\"fait accompli\"* was later established lacking due conformity with the terms and provisions of the September Heads of Agreement with the Government, and also with manifest deviation from the locations delineated on the attached map to that agreement. The subsequent alleged approval of a detailed, so called, Master Plan by the Minister of Tourism by April 1976 cannot retroactive validate that *\"fait accompli\"* or cure the vice of the lack of respect of the provisions of the September Heads of Agreement taking into consideration that the Minister of Tourism, in his ministerial capacities, was to be entrusted with the duty of the implementation of the Heads of Agreement. In this respect any legal consequence thereupon shall be dealt with later.\n\nNoteworthy in this respect, that in their request for arbitration to ICSID dated August 20, 1984, the Claimants stated \"September 1974 - *the SPP group submitted a project proposal to develop the Pyramids Plateau,* to include Hotels, Tourist villages...\" (Claimants\u2019 request for arbitration, p. 9, emphasis added). As in September 1974 the Heads of Agreement was concluded, with the Claimants, indicating the site of the project, as shown in the attached maps to that Agreement, *around* the Plateau, and not *on* the Plateau, this may corroborate the fact that the clear intention of the Egyptian Government was not to accept the \"Project proposal to develop the *\u2018Pyramids Plateau,'\"* as regards the site, hence it was agreed between the parties to implement the projet *around the Plateau* and not *on the Plateau.*\n\nIt seems,however that, *vis-\u00e0-vis that fait accompli* the Administration was obviously under the pressure of severe critics, internally i.e. culminating in the interpellation before the People\u2019s Assembly, as well as internationally by a world wide campaign against the project as will be demonstrated later.\n\nXI.\n\nMoreover, the application presented by Mr. El Babiy, the attorney to the Claimants, on behalf of both EGOTH and SPP to the GIA on April 22, 1975 contains in annex I under item (6) \"the chosen site\" the following information: \"HADABAT EL AHRAM WA RAS EL HEKMA,\" which can be translated as follows \"The Plateau of the Pyramids and Ras el Hekma.\" However, in annex II to the same application in front of item (2) \"the chosen location: The indication of the precise location...,\" it is mentioned \"The area south to the Pyramids Plateau of Giza\" and in Arabic: \"MANTIKAT GANOUB HADABAT AHRAMAT EL GIZA...\" (Resp, annex F.17).\n\nThe contradiction in the information given in the two annexes to the same application is puzzling. More, in Appendix No. (2) written in English the contradiction also appears: under the item \"For establishing a tourist project having an objective\" it is written: \"Developing world tourism in the Plateau area.\" But on the same page (p. 4) and in front of the item: \"The location proposed to establish the project...\" it is written that it is *\"The area south of the Giza Pyramids Plateau...*\" (emphasis added. Resp, annex: F.17). It is then \"the area south of the Giza Pyramids Plateau\" and not as finally implemented on the south area of the Giza Pyramids Plateau.\n\n2- *The Housing Activities:* \"or the alleged Claimants\u2019 departure\" from their legal and contractual obligations\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe housing argument advanced by the respondent is based upon the allegation that the claimants, in the implementation of their project, departed from the framework of the approval for their project. In this respect, Respondent alleges that:\n\n- The Egyptian side insisted all along on a Tourist Development project.\n\nAnd that\n\n- the Egyptian Law bars non-Arab foreign capital from entering into housing activities. (Respondent Counter-Memorial vol. 135)\n\nA. The Respondent\u2019s Allegations:\n--------------------------------\n\nI.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the status of a project under the provisions of law 43 is conditioned by the approval of the project by the Board of Directors of the GIA, after going through certain procedures and the satisfaction of certain formalities. The Respondent points out that the application presented to the GIA specifically sates that it was a touristic project that will be implemented and that \"the implementation of the project will result in the creation and development of touristic areas in the pyramids area, the re-planning of the areas, supplying it with the required infrastructures like roads lighting and sewage, and the establishment of touristic hotels and villages, markets and sporting clubs, etc.\" (Resp, annex F.17)\n\nII.\n\nRespondent also points out that in appendix No. (2) to the application it is sated, concerning the annual operational requirement of the project, that \"the imported in foreign currency and equivalent in Egyptian currency according to official rate \" was estimated as follows: First year: invested amount: 22,500,000 US dollars plus loans amounting to 16,000,000 US dollars etc..., and that the proposed steps to implement the project were indicated as follows \"the implementation will be by phases starting with leveling the Pyramids plateau and constructing a touristic hotel, thereafter a touristic complex and sport clubs, establishing the villas area and the commercial market and the conference hall.\" (Resp, annex 17. Appendix (2) to the application, p. 11)\n\nIII.\n\nThe touristic nature of the project was also evident in the terms of the act of incorporation of ETDC of November 23, 1975, asserts the Respondent. Attention was drawn to the provision of article (3) of the above mentioned act by which it appears that the project was essentially and mainly a touristic project aiming to develop international tourism, consequently any other allowed activity mentioned as \"a clause de style\" in the act of incorporation should be construed as necessarily falling under the framework of the touristic activity accorded to the Company.\n\nIV.\n\nRespondent also draws the attention to the provisions of Law No. 43 which bar non-Arab foreign capital from investment in housing and urban development project and to the provisions of Law No. 52 of 1940 which impose restrictions concerning land division. In this context Respondent also refers to the provisions of Law No. 81 of 1976 which impose restrictions as regards the acquisition by non-Egyptians of real estate property including rights of usufruct and leases which exceed fifty years. (Respondent Counter-Memorial, vol I, p. 147). Moreover, Respondent contends that Law 43 itself explicitly forbids non-Arab foreign capital from entering the field of housing and urban development, a field the essence of which, as explains the Respondent, is the purchase, sale or leasing of built or unbuilt real estate.\n\nV.\n\nRespondent alleges that, \"the least that could be said is that the Egyptian parties were the subject of an error (in fact were induced to fall into an error) concerning the nature of the obligations assumed by the other party, an error involving both the object of the contractual obligations of that party and the essential motivation which led the Egyptian Parties to enter (each within the limits of their role) into agreements with the Claimants.\" (Resp. Counter-Memorial vol I, p. 150. Emphasis added).\n\nVI.\n\nRespondent also points out that the undue haste in selling, unlawfully, vacant building lots confirms the view that SPP's venture in Egypt was essentially an urban land speculation venture. In this respect, Respondent contends that notwithstanding the fact that ETDC did not receive the tide of usufruct upon the land at the Pyramids until December 12, 1976 it did in fact begin making plans, after only two weeks of its incorporation on December 4, 1975, to sell vacant lots (Board minutes dated December 12, 1975 Resp. Counter-Memorial vol I, p. 165) and made from that operation its major preoccupation (Resp. Counter-Memorial vol I p. 164). As evidence to that contention Respondent reproduces a list of extracts from ETDC\u2019s Board minutes. (Resp. Counter-Memorial vol I, p. 165). An example is produced to the effect that by February 21,1976 the Board approved the budget with \"income of 1.5 million from 250 sales contracts.\" The Respondent also points out that the Claimants themselves admitted in their memorial to this Tribunal that the outlining of site was determined in the letter to that effect sent by EGOTH on February the 3rd 1976 to ETDC and that the site was delivered only on February 21, 1976 (Resp. Counter-Memorial vol 1, p. 166).\n\nVII.\n\nRespondent thus concludes that, apart from the sale of SPP shares to Mr. Khashoggi in 1976 and of SPP (ME) shares to the Saudi princes in the same year, the sale of drawings of vacant plots on maps was the only serious operation that the Claimants were engaged in. Respondent refers to the joint report of Peat Marwick Mclintock and Hazem Hassan Co., which comes to the conclusion that the net revenue from the sales agreed up to June 18, 1978 amounts to 7,428,000.- US dollars (Resp. Counter-Memorial vol I, pp. 167, 168, and annex F. 50 p. 15).\n\nVIII.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent points out that no system of Law can uphold a deal which a country enters into, by the admission of all parties, to obtain needed foreign currencies in the form of initial investment and continuous revenue from tourism, but which the other party turns into, not even a housing project, but a land speculation project and in which the money comes from the nationals of those countries (and moreover is potentially transferable abroad).\n\nIX.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that there are two additional reasons which render the sales contracts, the main activity of ETDC under the management of the Claimants, illegal. These reasons, in view of the fact that the September Heads of Agreement was not implemented, are:\n\na. That all the acts through which the Egyptian Government gave or recognized the right of EGOTH to use and exploit the Pyramids site could but be considered administration permits upon public domain. Such permits, in Egyptian Law, could never establish a right of usufruct.\n\nb. That since the usufruct rights are extinguished in all events, under Egyptian Law, by the death of the beneficiary, the attempt made in the contracts of sale (article 5) to get around the provision of the Law should be considered illegal. The above mentioned clause (5) of the contract stipulates, as a matter of fact, that, in case of the decease of the purchaser, the seller covenants to transfer the right of usufruct to the purchaser\u2019s successors for the unexpired period of 99 years.\n\nX.\n\nRespondent also contends that since the claimants and ETDC, the Company they managed, did violate Law 43 in intention and in deed, the Heads of Agreement is to be considered null and void on the grounds of the illegality of both the object and cause, in accordance with articles 136, 137 and 141 of the Civil Code of Egypt. Moreover, Respondent advances that the Heads of Agreement is to be considered null and void on another ground; the illegitimacy of its cause i.e. the illegitimacy of the Claimants\u2019 demonstrated intention to embark on a project, the main content of which is a real estate operation involving the division of land, without respect to the provisions of Law No. 52 of 1940 concerning the division of land for the purpose of building.\n\nXI.\n\nRespondent explains that it cannot be argued that the Egyptian Government, as such, connived in all the above mentioned irregularities attributed to ETDC or to the Claimants, as they were its actual managers, since:\n\n- No recognition, acceptance or connivance of an official can transform an illegal act into a legal one.\n\n- With the \"caducit\u00e9\" of the September Heads of Agreement, their Egyptian partner became exclusively EGOTH whose actions do not bind the Egyptian Government.\n\n- That it is not true that the Egyptian partners accepted without protest what ETDC did. Among other examples, Respondent contends that even the decree of the Minister of Tourism No. 96 of 1977 (Cls exh: 132) was meant among other things to reaffirm the inalienable power of the administration to control the purposes for which the lots of land may be used.\n\nB. The Claimants\u2019 response:\n---------------------------\n\nThe Claimants, however, give a totally different presentation to this issue. They assert that the project was not a housing project in which foreign investment was banned. (Cls. Reply, pp. 41-54).\n\nI.\n\nClaimants explain that the sale of villa lots by ETDC was an integral part of the entire tourist destination concept which was at the base of the proposals SPP made to the Egyptian Government since 1974. In this respect, Claimants point out that the nature of their project as a \"tourist destination resort\" was understood and admitted by the Parties starting from the negotiations of the Heads of Agreement which refer to \"tourist destination complexes.\" Moreover, the Claimants refer to the answer of the Minister of Economy before the People\u2019s Assembly which contained a clear acknowledgment of the concept. (Cls. exh: 74 p. 50). Claimants also assert that \"representatives of the Government were fully advised of, and approved of, the concept.\" (Cls Reply p. 45). The Claimants explain that that knowledge and understanding of the concept \"was brought home to Respondent representatives in early 1975 by the visit to SPP\u2019s Pacific Harbor Resort in Fiji.\" There, as Claimants point out, those representatives were shown a sales\u2019 program which existed from the time the resort was founded in 1969 and the sales were used to finance the infrastructures of the resort on which were founded a Hotel, golf course and other tourist amenities.\n\nII.\n\nClaimants also assert that the basic accords establishing the project were clear:\n\na. The Heads of Agreement spoke of the plan to develop \"residential and tourist destination complexes\" and provided that the Joint Company \"will be free to rent, lease, manage or assign any site... in both local and foreign markets...\" (Cls exh:9O).\n\nb. The contract of December 1974 also provided that \"ETDC shall be free to assign its rights of usufruct and to rent, lease, manage, promote or assign any site... in both local and foreign markets, provided that they are developed and utilized in accordance with approved plans.\" (Cls exh: 94). In this respect, the Claimants draw the attention to the provisions of article 12 of contract which stated that ETDC\u2019s profits derive from *inter alia* \"the assigning [and] leasing of... development sites.\"\n\nc. The November 23, 1975 act of incorporation of ETDC pointed out that it \"may buy, sell right of usufruct, lease, re-rent the desert lands in the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma sites... for touristic purposes.\" (Cls exh: 113)\n\nIII.\n\nClaimants assert that knowledge and approval of the villa site marketing site program is evidenced by Respondent acceptance of three reports which contained the site sales plan:\n\na. The economic feasibility study submitted to the GIA for approval of project on April 14, 1975 (cls. exh: 104)\n\nb. The summary economic analysis of March 1975 by Economics Research Associates (cls. exh: 102)\n\nc. The marketing report of February 1975, for the Cairo Pyramids Development, prepared by SPP (cls. exh: 101)\n\nIV.\n\nThe Claimants also point out that the resolution taken by the Board of EGOTH to the effect of the transfer of the usufruct rights over the site to ETDC contained clear provisions concerning ETDC\u2019s right to transfer, sell or lease the right of usufruct (cls. exh: 132). Moreover, as pointed out by the Claimants, ETDC\u2019s program for sales was unanimously approved by its Board of Directors which included representatives of EGOTH.\n\nV.\n\nBesides reliance upon legal opinions by experts in Egyptian Law, particularly the opinion of Dr. Oteifi, (cls. exh: 82), the Claimants rely upon the answer of the Minister of Tourism on February 7, 1978 before the People\u2019s Assembly, and they quote the said Minister as stating \"the Pyramids Plateau project is a tourist development project and not a construction project and family habitation - as it was raised up - depending on what was said in Article 3 of the Company objectives which state what follows: To carry out international tourist development in both the Pyramids and... in the limit of the adopted Master Plan by building hotels, cinemas, restaurants, night clubs... The sale of usufruct of land, on the first tourist villages, is considered only as the first basic step on the way to completion of the project\u2019s first phase. This could not be considered as a partitioning of land because it is within a completed plan...\" (cls. exh: 74, p. 38) '\n\nC. Personal Considerations:\n---------------------------\n\nThe issue of the housing argument is to be appreciated, from a legal point of view, in the light of the whole contractual operations entered into and agreed upon by the Claimants and also by the Respondent and in the light of the pertinent provisions of Egyptian law mainly law No. 43 of 1974 and No. 1 of 1973 concerning Tourist establishments. This will be discussed in the next chapter of this opinion.\n\nHowever, I would like to point out, in this respect, that Law 43 was enacted on the basis of a certain philosophy which is clearly mentioned, as well as obviously apparent in its provisions. Article (3) of Law 43 reads as follows \"the investment of Arab and foreign capital in the Arab Republic of Egypt shall be for the purpose of realizing the objectives of economic and social development within the framework of the State\u2019s general policy and national plan provided that the investment is made in projects in need of international expertise in the sphere of modem development or in projects requiring foreign capital...\" From the face of it \"This statement refers to the need for both foreign capital and foreign technology.\" (M.H. Davis, Business Law in Egypt, Kluwer 1984, p. 50). Article (1) of the same law gives a definition to the term \"project,\" it reads as follows \"the term project in the application of the provisions of this law shall mean any activity *included within any of the spheres therein specified and approved by the Board of Directors of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones\"* (emphasis added). Therefore, two prerequisites are necessarily to be justified for a project to enjoy the advantages of the said law: that the activity be within one of the spheres of activities specified by the law and that it receives the approval of the GIA. Special attention should be focused upon the last paragraph of Article (3) of Law No. 43. It reads as follows \"Special priority shall be given to those projects which are designed to generate exports, encourage tourism, or reduce the need to import basic commodities...\" Also it is of importance to review thoroughly the provisions of article (2) of Law 43 which states that \"the term in application of the provisions of this law shall be deemed to mean the following:...\" then follow the different aspects that are considered invested capital with a manifest stress upon the fact that the invested capital consists mainly in the foreign currency transferred to the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\nI.\n\nIt was clearly stated and hence logically and legally understood that the nature of the project was intended to be a touristic project. A cursory look to the provisions of the Heads of Agreement reveals that in the preamble of that Agreement it was stated that \"this Agreement is issued in accordance with law No. 1 for the year 1973 relating to hotels, Installations and Tourism, and law No. 2 for the year 1973 relating to the supervision by the Ministry of Tourism on touristic sites and the development of such areas, and law 43...\" (Cls exh. 3)\n\nAlso the first of the joint ventures objectives was \"to develop international tourism in the Pyramids and Ras-El-Hekma sites within the limits of the approved Master Plan by establishing, constructing, developing, furnishing, equipping and managing hotels, casinos, restaurants... (Art. 3 of the Act of Incorporation of ETDC, Cls, exh. 5). This fact is also corroborated by the language of the request presented to the GIA for the approval of the project (Resp. Annex F.17). Any other way of development that may have been practiced by the Claimants in other projects elsewhere does not by itself indicate that the Egyptian Administration acquiesced to that method. As regards the Egyptian venture, it was clearly stated that \"the implementation will be by phases starting with leveling the Pyramids Plateau and constructing a touristic hotel, *thereafter* a touristic complex...\" (The application to GIA. Resp. Annex F17, p. 11)\n\nIn this context, I may draw the attention to that the Chairman of ETDC on the meeting of the board of january 26, 1978 \"pointed out that he had talks with the Minister of Tourism on the question of the 4000 beds to become available... The Minister sent a letter... *asking for confirmation by the company of this obligation. This answer was necessary for the Minister to convince the Assembly of the touristic nature of the project...*\" (Resp. Annex F20, p. 9 emphasis added)\n\nThis may suggest that up to January 1978, the activities of ETDC did not reveal adherence to, and conformity with, the \"nature\" of the project as understood by the parties, or at least by the Respondent in a legal logical expectation. The Administration, in order to defend itself before the People\u2019s Assembly, seemed begging the Claimants, not even to abide by their obligations, but just to declare their intentions to this effect.\n\nII.\n\nThe application presented to the GIA on April 22, 1975 by the then Legal Advisor and Consultant to SPP, on behalf of SPP and E GOTH, contains two information:\n\na. Under the item \"Capital expenditures of the project,\" it was stated: Imported in foreign currency and equivalent in Egyptian currency: 550,000,000.- US dollars. Under the same item it was written: \"The total estimated expenses for the various constructions on the site amount to five hundred and fifty million dollars during ten years... include (sic) the construction of hotels providing 15000 beds.\"\n\nb. That the proposed steps to implement the project are \"the implementation will be by phases starting with leveling the Pyramids plateau and constructing a touristic hotel, thereafter a touristic complex and...\" (emphasis added. Resp, annex F 17, p. 11).\n\nIII.\n\nIt can but be observed that the Claimants rely upon that application, concerning the issue of the site, but seem to overlook the obligations they had engaged themselves to, by the same document. They clearly estimated the imported foreign currency amounting to 550 million dollars over ten years, with the solemn obligation to begin the implementation of the project by the construction of a hotel.\n\nIV.\n\nAdmitting, *arguendo,* that they had the discretion of selling lots of bare lands, the Claimants\u2019 obligation remains to be fulfilled: that is to say, the importation of the foreign currency and the construction of at least a hotel on the site. The argument of auto financing, which is advanced, should be construed, however, in the light of the clear language of the application to the effect that the investments will take the form of imported foreign currency. Whether or not the Claimants had the financial capacities at the time of the presentation of that application, seems irrelevant, since the fact is that they did not honour their obligation in this respect. It seems to me opportune, in these circumstances, to point out that on May 19, 1975, Mr. Gilmour, the representative of the Claimants, sent a letter directly to the President of the Republic concerning the demand for approval that the usufruct rights be accorded to a duration of 99 years, which letter contained that the justification for that demand rests upon the fact that this duration \"is a must for such a big sized project which will need a capital of 770 million dollars...\" (Resp, annex F 23, p. 25). So it appears that the estimation given by the Claimants, concerning the total investment in the end of April 1975 amounting to 550 million dollars, escalated in mid-May 1975, not even one month later, to 770 million dollars, the difference being only the trifle amount of 220 million dollars.\n\nOne may consider that the presentation of the application to GIA was misleading since the claimants advocate that they had all the way the intention that the project be auto-financed, and at the same time they present an application, which in fact and in law, embodies their obligations in the framework of the legal status of law 43, in which they explain that the nature of the project is tourism and that *\"the imported foreign currency\"* amounts to 550 million dollars.\n\nIn this vein, another document may also be considered of importance. Reference is made here to the December 12, 1974 contract concluded between EGOTH and SPP. Article 11 of the said contract reads in pertinent parts as follows: \"The profits will be derived from the operation and management of hotels, casinos, conferences and convention centers, sporting clubs, shopping complexes and other tourist facilities, and from the assigning, leasing and management of, and the provisions of services to, villas, apartments and development sites...\" (cls. exh:4). If the above mentioned article states that profits may be engendered by assigning or leasing of development sites, it does not however make of that activity the main one of the projected Company. This evident fact is confirmed by the language of article (1) of the contract entered into by EGOTH and SPP (ME) dated November 23, 1975 which reads as follows \"The undersigned have agreed to found a joint stock Egyptian Company with a license from the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt conforming with Law No. 1 of 1973 concerning tourist establishments...\". So the Company (ETDC) is constituted as a tourist Company felling under the provisions of Law No. 1 of 1973 concerning tourist establishments. The objectives of the said Company, as determined in Article (3) of the above mentioned contract, are: \"1. to develop international tourism... by establishing, constructing, developing, furnishing, equipping and managing hotels... The Company has the right to manage, operate, lease, sell and in every way dispose of the above mentioned establishments. 2. To create and develop touristic sites by employing the most up to date method for developing tourist industries and replanning them and provide them with infrastructures, roads and services. To achieve this it may buy, sell right of usufruct, lease, rent the desert lands in the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma sites (on the Mediterranean Coast) for *touristic purposes.* 3....\" (emphasis added). Without going through the whole enumeration of the company\u2019s objectives, it may be appropriate to comment upon the language of paragraphs 1 and 2 of article 3 of the contract. It goes without saying that paragraph 1 speaks about the selling or leasing of establishments. However, if paragraph 2 gives ETDC the right to sell or lease the right of usufruct over the lands of the sites, it specifies that that right of selling or leasing is permitted provided it be *\"for touristic purposes.\"* This provision should have an *effet utile* so to say to have a meaning and a significance. The transaction, any transaction, must then comply with that obligation. However, it did not occur to the Claimants to present indications to this Tribunal to the effect that their selling operations of lots of bare lands obeyed to any touristic purpose criteria in the meaning of the above mentioned article. Selling bare lands to the high accepting purchaser, without any discrimination seems to be more in harmony with activities relating to urban development rather than to activities of investment in operations serving touristic purpose, and necessarily confined to it *inter alia* in compliance with the *raison sociale* of the joint venture ETDC.\n\nV.\n\nTo begin its activities by selling bare lots of land on the site, and to continue these activities over the period from November 1975 to the date of cancellation of the project in May 1978, may indicate that ETDC under the management of the Claimants departed, at least, from the obligation concerning the phases they clearly were engaged to respect, as stated in their application to GIA dated April 22, 1975. Therefore, it seems of minor importance what Claimants advance concerning approvals, by officials: *inter alia* the Minister of Tourism by decree No. 96 of 1977, of the selling of lots of land. Approvals to the selling should be construed in the framework of the joint ventures legal capacity and cannot alter the obligation the Claimants were under, on the faith of the act of incorporation of ETDC. The selling operations were legally conditioned and determined by the purpose of this activity, that is to say, to serve touristic purposes. In fact this condition is to be considered a clause related to the legal validity of the operation. It is by respecting this clause that touristic projects differ from urban development projects. To conclude otherwise is to render the *provisio in fine* of paragraph 2 of article 3, meaningless and superfluous. It may also be reminded that the issue was raised at a meeting of the Board of Directors of ETDC where \"Mr. Lotfy discussed the paper handed to him by Mr. Birchall after the last meeting and said the figure was shown under the assumption that the whole concept of *the paper proposed for principal Company policy was only on the real estate and not on the development of tourism...*\" (minutes of the meeting dated March 14, 1978 Resp, annex 20, emphasis added). It may also be reminded that the calculation of compensation requested by the Claimants as their principal submission, rests mainly upon the same concept: the price of the selling of lots of bare land.\n\nVI.\n\nMoreover, in any event, the selling of bare lots of land appears, from the whole contractual documents, as a faculty that may be recoursed to, but does not constitute the main or even a main objective of the project. It is noteworthy, in this respect, to draw the attention to item 7 and 14 of the Board of ETDC meeting on January 26, 1978. (Resp, annex F-20 p. 9). As a matter of fact, the following was written \"a) exchanged letters with the Minister of Tourism: Dr. Salah (the Chairman of ETDC) pointed out that he had talks with the Minister of Tourism on the question of the 4000 beds to become available in the Pyramids Oasis project. *The Minister then sent a letter signed by the first Undersecretary of Tourism, asking for confirmation by the Company of this obligation. This answer was necessary for the Minister to convince the Assembly of the tourist nature of the project.\"* (emphasis added). This citation tells much by itself about the weight which may be given to the answers of the Minister of Tourism before the People\u2019s Assembly.\n\nVI.\n\nThe minutes  of ETDC Board of October 4, 1976 are, perhaps more relevant as regards the housing issue. Under item 76/53 Marketing Report, it is written \"Mr. Raouf presented a recommendation for the sale of350 villa sites from October 1976 which was approved. It was also agreed that the principal objective will be to maximize cash sales. *Any shortfall of cash sales to non-Egyptian purchasers will be allocated to house sales for Egyptian cash purchasers...*\" (Emphasis added)\n\nVII.\n\nWithout going through the examination of whether or not ETDC\u2019s activities in selling bare lots of land contravened certain Egyptian Laws, it is evident that those activities were not to be considered valid unless they serve touristic purposes. Otherwise they are considered activities exceeding the legal capacity of the Company. The interpretation of the clause *in fine* of paragraph 2, reveals the harmony existing between the provisions of both paragraphs 1 and 2 of the said article 3. ETDC was empowered to transact either touristic constructed establishments, or bare land to serve touristic purposes. Consequently, ETDC was bound to act in accordance with its *\"raison sociale\"* and had no legal capacity to exceed it. The argument advanced by the Claimants to the effect that the project they were implementing was based on the same concept of their project in Fiji, and that representatives of EGOTH were shown the destination resort they were implementing in Fiji cannot have relevance, since the concept of their Egyptian venture was essentially based upon the touristic nature; which is clearly mentioned in the application presented to the GIA for approval on April 22, 1975, and also embodied in the act of incorporating ETDC as mentioned above.\n\nVIII.\n\nIn a brief conclusion, which will be developed later, it is certain that the Claimants departed from the following:\n\na. Their declared obligation to start implementing the project by phases with the priority of the construction of a hotel (see the application to the GIA dated April 22, 1975).\n\nb. Their commitments as regards the objectives of ETDC which mandates that all and any transaction be permitted only in the limits, and provided that, it serves touristic purposes. In this respect, whatever their intention was, concerning the implementation of a tourist destination resort, the Claimants were obligated to be respectful of the stated objectives of ETDC which mandate that all transactions be justified by the condition of serving touristic purposes.\n\nBy first proceeding with its large campaign of selling bare lots of land, for the purchasers, eventually, to construct villas indifferent to what the use may be whether touristic or not, on both the outside and mainly the local markets, before any approval of an agreed detailed Master Plan, in addition to its nonobservance and non-compliance with the sequential phases of the implementation of the project as stated in the application presented to the GIA, ETDC was consequently in a precarious legal situation subject to the provisions of Article 27 of Law 43 which provides in pertinent parts that \"the Board of Directors of the Authority shall have the authority to approve applications for investment submitted. Such approval shall lapse if the investor fails to take serious steps to carry out the project within six months of approval.\" It is noteworthy to point out that in the application to the GIA, it was mentioned that the invested amount, in foreign imported currency, totals 38 million dollars for the first year of implementation of the project then accruing during the following years (resp. annex F 20, 17), always in imported foreign currency. This engagement necessarily was binding, and should be taken into consideration by this Tribunal in its impartial evaluation of the nature of the project, the Claimants were intended to implement, mainly in the light of their effective contribution in the capital of the joint venture ETDC and of the loan agreement they concluded between themselves and the joint venture ETDC under their management, even before the payment of the full amount of their agreed upon contribution in the capital of ETDC, all of these amounts totaling the sum of 3,360,000 U.S. Dollars compared to the revenue from the sale of bare lots of land agreed up to June 18, 1978, which amounts to 7,428,000 U.S. Dollars. (Respondent annex F.50 p. 15). However, the Majority Award even stated, as a matter of uncontested fact that \"... ETDC sold 386 lots... for a total of U.S. Dollars 10,211,000.\" (The Majority Award p. 25 [p. 348 of this issue]), and later took its findings, in this respect, into consideration as regards the evaluation of \"... the value to be ascribed to the opportunity to make a commercial success of the project\" (the Majority Award, p. 85 [p. 389 of this issue]).\n\nTo conclude on this issue, I may only draw attention to the fact that the Claimants rely as regards their argument of auto-financing to the content of the feasibility study presented to the GIA, nevertheless they seem to consider the same and one feasibility study as not binding when it comes to embody their obligations: in this vein, I may refer to the memoranda prepared by the Claimants\u2019 lawyer stating that \"the indications included in the feasibility study initially submitted reflect the financial and economic concept of the project *but the company is not bound by it in its activities if this would affect said objectives...* (Resp. Annex D14 p. 4 Emphasis added). This memoranda was prepared in response to the letter of EGOTH dated April 4, 1977 to ETDC, containing reference to the serious diversions of ETDC\u2019s activities from its basic obligations under the provision of its act of incorporation and of the approval of GIA.\n\nIn this context, I may add that due attention should be drawn to the content of the inner-office memorandum dated August 28, 1975 in which Mr. Munk addressing the SPP\u2019s executive committee explained that the objectives of the Egyptian program were *inter alia* \"to create a new significant and saleable asset to enable the SPP if so wishes, to eliminate the current indebtedness...\", and that among the required actions figures *\"to get ETDC operational (i.e. to start land sales etc.)\"* and that one of the priorities is *\"to make ETDC operational with the prime objective to start selling land.\"* (Resp. Annex F 56 Emphasis Added)\n\nThen the \"prime objective\" as mentioned in that memorandum was *\"to start selling.\"* This prime objective the Claimants were intended to achieve does not by any standard coincide with their solemn obligations, whether under the legal status of investors in the framework of law 43, or their obligations emanating from their contractual agreements. In all events it is a fact, that the Claimants expressed in a letter to the Prime Minister, dated *May 12, 1978* that \"in spite of these encouraging initial indications of success, *the protracted debates in the People\u2019s Assembly, the various committee hearings and the adverse world wide publicity have now seriously impaired our effort to create the required credibility to attract the increasingly needed overseas finance for the project.\"* (resp Annex F.38, p. 2, Emphasis Added). As the above mentioned reasons fall beyond the administrations authority and were out of its reach, one can assume that the Claimants were trying to justify their incapacity to honour their obligations, in part, due to the adverse worldwide publicity which impaired their credibility to attract *the increasing needed overseas finance for the project.* Lacking that credibility the Claimants, at least, from that date seem to have had no other alternative, but to concentrate their activities in the selling of bare lots of land, which manifestly would have extracted definitely their activity not only from the domain of tourism but altogether from the scope of investment under both the Washington convention and the Law No. 43. The real nature of the Claimants\u2019 project as they had the intention to implement may be better demonstrated by a quotation of Mr. Gilmour\u2019s Affidavit presented both before the ICC and this Tribunal \"we abandoned the Egyptian plan in favor of the fully integrated high quality destination resort, which we felt uniquely qualified to conceive and implement. The general concept plan we devised for the Pyramids, in contrast, proposed *higher density housing* on the Plateau grouped in discreet \u2018desert villages\u2019 and in deference to General Zaki\u2019s wishes as we then understood them, we also incorporated plan *for tourist development* in the area of the Mena House at the entrance to the Pyramids from Fayoum Road.\" (Cls. exh 89, emphasis added)\n\n3. *The Critical date May-June 1978, and the Subsequent Conduct of the Parties*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn spite of that this section is mainly consecrated to the review of the facts that occurred around the critical date of May-June 1978 and the subsequent conduct of the Parties; however, it seems appropriate to review rapidly, in the first place, some facts that occurred before that date, which facts may enlighten the evaluation of the whole relationship between the Claimants and the Respondent.\n\nA. A review of some fact that marked the relationship between the two parties;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI.\n\nIn April 1974, the Claimants present themselves as developers. (Cls. exh. 81). In April 1974, SPP submitted a \"proposal on the development program of an international tourist destination - Resort complex for the Arab Republic of Egypt.\" In the preface to that document, the Claimants explain that the proposal was \"prepared by Southern Pacific Properties Limited (SPP) at the kind encouragement of H.E. Osman Ahmed Osman,\" and that \"SPP is a tourism vehicle of a group of major international cooperatives with combined assets in excess of US$ two billion.\" Under the title \"the program\" it was stated that \"the *Developers (SPP) will undertake to:...* (Emphasis added). The proposal did not contain any hint to a specific location for the project to be implemented on. Under tide \"the site\" it was only stated that \" A preliminary study has identified a number of potentially suitable sites. Factors which will influence the final choice are:...\"\n\nII.\n\nEGOTH informed SPP on June 6, 1974 of its interest to the proposal, in principle, provided the submission of a preliminary feasibility study. (Cls exh 83). By telex dated June 17, 1974, the Claimants advised EGOTH that they would proceed on June 21, with press release (Cls. exh.: 84). The press release contained information about the announcement in Cairo \"that the Egyptian Government has invited Southern Pacific Properties Limited, the Hotel and Resort Development group to start on the development of the major tourist complex in Egypt.\" (Cls. exh: 85)\n\nIII.\n\nNo feasibility study was submitted. However, the Heads of Agreement was concluded on September 23, 1974, and the Claimants explained that \"the SPP group submitted a project proposal to develop the Pyramids Plateau, to include hotels, tourist villages...\" (Claimants\u2019 request for Arbitration, p. 9). In Claimants\u2019 exhibit 174, they state that on September 1974 \"after several months of meetings with Government representatives, visits to pre-selected sites (at which time Government representatives urged consideration be given to Pyramids site) and internal discussions, SPP finalizes field studies and submits general concept project proposal for *inter alia* future Pyramids Oasis sites.\" Then the Claimants explain that the \"project proposal is presented to the President Sadat by David Gilmour and Peter Munk (Chairman of SPP). The President gives his unqualified approval.\" In this respect, Claimants refer to their exhibits 902 and 91. From the outset, it should be pointed out that the documents presented to this Tribunal do not reveal any indication to the effect that before the Heads of Agreement of September 23, 1974 was concluded, any other proposal or feasibility studies were presented to the Government of Egypt other than the proposal of April 1974 which in turn, did not contain any indication to a specific site. It seems noteworthy to stress upon the fact that what is qualified by the Claimants as the *\"unqualified approval\"* given by the President Sadat to their project proposal for \"future Pyramids Oasis site\" (Claimants exhibit 174, 901 and 902) is necessarily erroneous, since the maps attached to the Heads of Agreement signed the next day to the presentation of the project to President Sadat (acting in his capacity of Prime Minister at that time), show the site of a project on a totally different location, that is *mainly around the Pyramids Plateau* and not on top of it as the project was finally being implemented. The avatars that occurred as regards the site of the project are already treated above and need not be repeated here. However, the Claimants reiterated contentions as regards the full unqualified endorsement of President Sadat to the project, implying his approval, at least by that time, to the specific site of the project where it was finally being implemented, all the way before other Jurisdictions (see the Affidavit of Mr. Gilmour before the ICC, presented in the ICSID proceedings, Cls exh: 89) and even during long stages of the present proceedings before this Tribunal where, presumably, all conclusive and pertinent documents are to be submitted and subjected to the Tribunal\u2019s impartial consideration. This fact may suggest answers to the somehow aberrant conduct of some administrative authorities vis-a-vis the Claimants, and ETDC, under their management, during their activities in Egypt. Whether or not of any legal significance before this Tribunal in the outcome of the present dispute, that erroneous contention raises questions to be answered: why did the Claimants allege the \"unqualified approval\" of their project by President Sadat when it was materially proven that that allegation was not correct, and what eventual consequences that allegation may have produced in the process of the implementation of their project.\n\nIV.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 exhibit 174 consecrated to the review of the chronology of the events.\n\n- They state that \"September 23: Heads of Agreement for project concluded and signed by the Egyptian Government, General Zaki (representing EGOTH), and SPP, the Heads of Agreement provide for SPP and EGOTH to establish two complexes, *one on the Pyramids Plateau,* the other near Ras el Hekma (Cls. exh. 90). *Subsequent discussions concerning the re-siting of* the Pyramids Project: see Cls. exh. 175 and 177. (Emphasis added). These two exhibits contain statements of Mr. Gerald Walker and Mr. Ralph M. Grierson both dated November 30, 1989. Without going through the content of these statements, it is noteworthy to point out that if *arguendo* as stated by Mr. Walker \"very rough maps of the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma project areas were annexed to that agreement\" (Reference is made to the September Heads of Agreement, Cls. exh. 175). The fact remains that even the maps, attached to the confidential report annexed to the December 12, 1974, show the site located in a different zone from that where the project was finally being implemented. It is to be noted that the December 12, 1974 Contract was concluded between the Claimants and EGOTH. Thus, the Egyptian Government, contrary to the Heads of Agreement, was not party to that contract. The Contract provides adherence to the September Heads of Agreement and more specifically to the *maps attached to the September Agreement.* Article (4) of the contract provides that \"ETDC will undertake the development and management of both *projects within the general limits described in the maps attached to the Heads of Agreement* and in general accord with the confidential report, and as detailed in the Master Plans to be prepared...\" (Cls. exh. 4. Emphasis added). From the outset, it is evident by the clear language of the December Contract that:\n\n- The contract was concluded \"following execution of the Heads of Agreement dated 23rd September 1974\"\n\n- The contract refers in an unequivocal language to the fact that ETDC will undertake the development of both projects *within the general limits of the maps attached* to the September Heads of Agreement.\n\n- The contract bears no mention to any other maps attached to it, but refers only to a so-called confidential report. Then it was to that report, which to my humble knowledge does not contain any confidentiality, that was attached maps that showed the site in a different location than that shown in the attached maps to the September Heads of Agreement.\n\nIn the light of these considerations, it is evident that the parties to the contract of December declared their intention to execute the Heads of Agreement and not to amend it, and, in 6ct and in law, they reiterated their obligation to be respectful to implement their projected activity \"within the general Emits.\" The word within means *: Inside, internally, inwardly* (The Oxford Illustrated Dictionary p. 972) and *Dans - en dedans de - dans l'espace de* (Grand Dictionnaire Gamier, p. 596). In both English and French languages, the word indicates the same meaning which is inside. So the sites should have been inside the *general limits* as shown in the attached maps to the September Heads of Agreement. Contrary to that clear language, it was annexed to the Contract a \"Confidential Report\", then attached to that report a map showing a different site not *within* but *outside* the general limits of those indicated in the maps attached to the Heads of Agreement of September. It is noteworthy in this respect, to point out that the December Contract did not mention any reference to any attached maps. It is a matter of Law to decide the legal consequences emanating from this contradiction. However, in the impartial evaluation of all the aspects of the relationship between the Claimants and their Egyptian counterparts, such conduct, with or without the connivance of those who entered into the December Contract may be relevant. The fact that the clear language of the Contract contradicts manifestly with what was shown on *\"un-referred to maps\"* which were only annexed to the Confidential Report, which in turn was annexed to the Contract, along with other incidents of the like, may be appropriate elements in the evaluation of the overall relationship between the parties. This may be an element in the forming of a conviction to the effect that certain Egyptian administrative authorities may have acted, subsequently, on the faith of a *prima facia* assumption as to the correctness of that statement, thus taking the exactitude of the site as shown in the annexed maps to the attached report to the December Contract as a *fait accompli* as regards its concordance with the one and same site as shown on the maps attached to the September Heads of Agreement which were granted the *unqualified approval,* as the Claimants repeatedly explain, of President Sadat.\n\nV.\n\nThe incorporation of the joint venture ETDC and the Decree of the Minister of Economy.\n\nThe act of incorporation of ETDC of November 23, 1975 (Cls. exh. 5) provides in article (3) that \"the objects of the company: 1. to develop international tourism in the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma...\" No mention was made to any deviation or, I may say, derogation from the September Heads of Agreement as regards the site of the Project. However, a map was annexed to that act of incorporation, on which a different site was indicated than the one shown on all previous maps. Then occurred the issuance of the Decree of the Minister of Economy according approval for the incorporation of the joint venture. (Decree No. 212 of 1975. Cls. exh. 114). Article (2) of the said Decree is translated as follows \"the object of the company is to develop tourism in the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma sites in the limits of the approved Master Plan as indicated in the relevant statute attached here to\" the same exhibit contains the Arabic official version of that Decree which is best translated to English as follows \"the object of the company is to develop tourism in the region of the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma...\" in Arabic \"BI MANTIKAT AL AHRAMAT WA RAS EL HEKMA\" thus the project climbed on top of the Pyramids Plateau proper without any duly amendment to the September Heads of Agreement. Moreover, construction was intended to be only about one kilometer distant from the Pyramids proper as revealed by the statement mentioned above and relied upon by the Claimants, of a new Minister of Tourism who explained that he ordered that construction should be at a distance of at least two kilometers. Thus, it seems that the administration was not only trapped by the *fait accompli* consisting in the implementation of the project on the Plateau proper, but also was confronted with the critical issue of the safeguard of the monuments themselves (the Pyramids).\n\nVI.\n\nWithout going through the legal weight of the information about the \"invested capital\" the Claimants stated in their application to the GIA, and the commitment they undertook to comply with the requirements emanating from the touristic nature of the project, the inter office memorandum prepared on August 28, 1975 by Mr. Munk to SPP executive committee indicates, concerning the priorities, \"that since company resources to attain the objectives are limited, it is vital to focus action on proper priorities... b. Make ETDC operational *with the prime objective to start selling land (showing profits!)\"* (Resp, annex F.10), then the memorandum continues as follows \"to complete plan and models...\" Thus it is the sale of land that have prime priority in the Claimants\u2019 point of view, even before the completion of any plan or models. It is in the light *of* such unveiled intention of the Claimants that the housing argument should be considered. The fact that the Claimants later prepared designs available for the use of eventual purchasers of bare lots of land, cannot be relevant, as such, to accord to the project the nature and essence of a tourist project, in compliance with the declared intention of the parties embodied in several documents. It is noteworthy to mention that it is common practice by developers to arrange facilities to purchasers of bare lots of land *inter alia* to make available architectural designs or even propose the construction of buildings for the account of eventual purchasers. However, these activities cannot confer by themselves to a project the nature and essence of a touristic project.\n\nVII.\n\nIt should also be pointed out that the act of incorporation of the joint venture ETDC of November 23, 1975 was entered into by the Claimants not as representatives of SPP but of another company SPP (ME). This latter company had been, as revealed by documents presented before this Tribunal, initially incorporated in Hong Kong on October 18, 1974 under the name of \"Molins Investments Limited\" and then changed its name to SPP (ME) on November 12, 1974 (that is before the signature of the December 12, 1974 contract with EGOTH, the Claimants\u2019 Egyptian partner). Its capital amounted to 1000 Hong Kong Dollars, roughly less than 200 U.S. Dollars. The Claimants explained that this fact was acknowledged by the Egyptian partner since article (17) of the December contract reads as follows \"it is understood that SPP will be incorporating a holding company to own its shareholding in ETDC and it is agreed that SPP shall have the right to assign its rights, privileges, duties and obligations under this agreement to this company... provided the company satisfies EGOTH...\" (Cls. exh. 4). The assignment of rights to SPP (ME) was never legally notified to EGOTH more as it was proved before this Tribunal never an act of assignment did occur. However, the question rises about the legal significance of the provision in that article (17) of the contract of December, necessitating a fondamental requirement to any eventual assignment of rights by SPP to a third party which consists in *\"provided the Company satisfies EGOTH.\"* No act of assignment was ever effectuated to SPP (ME) and EGOTH was never formally notified about the *statut juridique* of SPP (ME). The obvious resemblance between the insignia of the two companies managed, as it seems, by the same people may have misled any unaware administrative authority. Even the Chairman of ETDC, who was a Claimants\u2019 representative seems not to differentiate between SPP and SPP (ME) since he was quoted stating before the Board of Directors on January 24-25 1977 that the statutes of the Company embodied in the Ministerial Decree No. 212 of 1975, \"are based on the agreement signed by the two shareholders namely SPP and EGOTH\" (without any mention to SPP (ME)). However, the provision in article (17) mandates the necessity to obtain the acceptance of EGOTH as to any act of assignment nevertheless it was just SPP (ME) replacing SPP as one more *fait accompli* that multiplied in the present case.\n\nVIII.\n\nThe conduct of the Claimants during the period of implementation of their project; a view from the inside: The minutes of the Board of Directors of ETDC (Respondent annex F.20) may be self telling and more evidence about the intentions and conduct of the Claimants:\n\n- In the meeting held on November 29, 1975, during the week that followed the signature of the act of incorporation of ETDC dated November 23, 1975, was present Mr. Gilmour in his capacity as \"Deputy Chairman of Southern Pacific Properties 'Limited\" who presided the meeting. In that meeting representatives of the Claimants were nominated, among others, figures Mr. S.S. Raouf an Egyptian official who introduced the Claimants in his capacity as Chief of the Office of Tourism in London. He was appointed as a representative of the Claimants in that meeting member of the Board for international marketing and accorded a salary of 9000 U.S. Dollars plus expenses, 9000 U.S. Dollars as well as a special allowance of 4000 U.S. Dollars plus 8000 U.S. Dollars as expenses. Under item 75/117 it was stated \"the forms of agreement *for sale* and purchase for cash on terms, *of underdeveloped lots in the Pyramids zone* was received, but consideration was deferred until the next meeting of the Board.\" (emphasis added)\n\n- In the meeting dated December 17, 1975, it was *\"agreed that reimbursement of pre-incorporation expenses* to SPP (ME) to the extent of U.S. Dollars 252,860.- and the short term interest free loan totaling US Dollars 57,157.71 be paid immediately.\" (Item 75/28. Emphasis added), even though the minutes do not reveal the presentation to and/or the study of any supporting documents in this respect by the Board of Directors. It was also agreed in the meeting dated February 21, 1976, to reimburse SPP (ME) for its expenditures incurred by it and charged to ETDC on the approval of the Director of the London office who was to be reminded once more the same Mr. S.S. Raouf, the SPP (ME)\u2019s representative at the Board of Directors.\n\n- On the next meeting dated April 27,1976 under item (76/25) it was mentioned: \"Approval of Master Plan: resolved that the Master Plan be formally approved by the Company. General Zaki advised that the Minister of Tourism had approved the Master Plan.\" From the outset, it seems puzzling that the Minister would have approved a Master Plan which was not yet approved by ETDC itself. Moreover, the same minutes of the same meeting contained information that General Zaki himself \"stated that EGOTH would present its remarks and comments on the Master Plan within 7-10 days. He also *stated that the Minister of Tourism had approved the Master Plan, but that government agencies had some remarks to make on the question of housing. All this can be ratified when preparing the detailed remarks on the infrastructures and from a touristic point of view.\"* (Emphasis added). It seems, in all events, that any alleged approval of a Master Plan was clearly conditional upon \"remarks to make on the question of housing.\" It seems noteworthy to point out the contradictory language attributed to General Zaki, the Head of EGOTH, quoting him as stating that the Minister of Tourism approved the Master Plan while reporting in clear language that government agencies had at least some reserves as regards the question of the housing and that EGOTH itself had yet to study the Master Plan. In any case, it is obvious, from the above statements, that the nature of the project as a touristic project was of a main concern to the administrative agencies in Egypt. However, it seems that the joint venture under the Claimants\u2019 management embarked on the sale of bare lots of land. In the meeting dated October 4, 1976, \"Mr. Raouf presented a recommendation for the sale of350 villa sites from October 1976 which was approved. *It was also agreed that the principal objective will be to maximize cash sales. Any cash sales to non-Egyptian purchasers will be allocated to house sales for Egyptian cash purchasers.\"* (Item 76/53. Emphasis added). This statement by itself needs no comment as regards the concept of the project that the Claimants were adopting and implementing. *It is noteworthy however that a representative of EGOTH on the Board helplessly pointed out at that meeting \"... 2. no map of the lots to be sold had been presented,* 3. *the sales contracts had not yet been presented to the Board.\"* The minutes of the same meeting contained information that \"General Zaki on behalf of EGOTH agreed to obtain any further governmental documentation or approvals required to implement sales.\" (item 76/54). Thus, it seems that Mr. Zaki engaged himself unconditionally to obtain any further governmental approval required to implement sales and that, obviously, was in contradiction with his previous declared attitude as regards the question of housing without any explanation in justification for this radical change of attitude. However, in the meeting on January 24-25, 1977, Mr. Zaki pointed out that *\"for the good image of the company we should start this year the implementation for one hotel at least and perhaps one holiday village.\"* (The Minutes, p. 6, emphasis added). What was meant by the good image of the company is, in my humble understanding, the adherence to the company\u2019s objectives which aim to the enhancement of tourism and the investment of the necessary capital to that effect, that is to say to comply with the obligations undertaken by the Claimants as investors in a tourist project under laws 1 and 2 of 1973 concerning tourist activities as well as under law 43 of 1974 concerning foreign investments.\n\n- At the same meeting Mr. Zaki also stated *\"that the budget is based on a certain concept and that is sales and loans...*\" his proposal was to submit \"the budget to the financial committee for the following reasons: *it may be that sales are now not legal* or that some legal procedures need to be fulfilled.\" (The Minutes p. 10. Emphasis added). As the motion on the budget was approved by a majority rule (that is to say by the Claimants) Mr. Zaki said that *if the Board did not agree on the principles of the budget and the concept how it was done and without time to study it,* he and the other EGOTH representatives would have to withdraw from the meeting, the action they effectively undertook.\n\nIt seems that it was a matter of *a tour de force* that the Claimants had recourse to on the basis of their majority on the Board of Directors. Beyond that fact, it seems appropriate to indicate that the Claimants were obviously intent and determined to maintain their own concept of the project as well as the reality about themselves: the concept being mainly an urban development project and the reality being developers and not investors as they claimed to be to the Egyptian Government, and specifically to the GIA. In this context, I may refer to the letter dated April 4, 1977 sent by the Chairman of EGOTH to the Chairman of ETDC in which the former points out the discrepancies between what was decided during the Board meetings of January 24 and February 9, 1977, and what was contained in the application to the GIA, the discrepancies consisted, as explained in the letter, in that *\"les buts du projet en tant qu'essentiellement un projet touristique* et les \u00e9tapes de sa constitution et ses d\u00e9lais. 2. *L\u2019information du financement du projet* (volume de l\u2019investissement soit en ce qui concerne le capital ou les emprunts)...\" (Resp. Annex F.60, p. 2 Emphasis added).\n\n- At the next meeting held on May 15, 1977, an EGOTH representative pointed out that after the last meeting \"the Minister of Tourism sent a letter to the company which we received a copy of *advising the company to stop sales and everything concerning the exploitation within the limits of the project...\"* (The Minutes, item 77/20, p. 6. Emphasis added). The Chairman of ETDC confirmed that information and did precise that the referred to letter reached the company on April 12, 1977.\n\nThis fact indicates the concern of the authorities in the Claimants compliance with the touristic nature of the project. It is in the light of such facts that should be considered and appropriately evaluated statements emanating from officials, whether to the press or before the People\u2019s Assembly in answer to questions and/or interpellations, the contradictory attitudes of certain officials revealed from documents presented before this Tribunal give weight to the Respondent\u2019s contention to the effect that certain officials, while defending or being forced to defend the Claimants in public, were, however, trying to make the Claimants act in accordance to the agreed upon *nature of the project* as touristic.\n\nI may refer, as an example, to the reply of the Minister of Tourism before the People\u2019s Assembly to the challenging question of Dr. Oteifi, where the Minister affirmed that \"the objects for which the company was established (a) *to develop international tourism* in the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma regions according to the approved Master Plan *and this by building hotels, cinemas, restaurants, parks, tourist accommodations and villages, clubs, cafes and other tourist facilities...\"* (Cls. exh. 87, p. 3. Emphasis added). Indeed the reply never hinted to the serious diversions as regards the nature of the project between the Claimants and their Egyptian partner.\n\n- At the meeting of the Board of June 7, 1977, all representatives of EGOTH were replaced. No reason was advanced, however, one couldn\u2019t but notice that during the meeting before, one representative of EGOTH was quoted as saying \"we are now building a State inside the frame of Egypt\" (the referred to Minutes, p. 19).\n\n- In the Board Meeting of November 13, 1977, Mr. Munk, the representative of the Claimants, stated that \"the hotel financing was proving to be more difficult than had been anticipated\" (Resp. Annex F.2O, p. 9). This statement unequivocally indicates that until November 1977, the investors, I mean the Claimants, had difficulties to arrange finance for a single hotel. It may be in these circumstances understandable that the Claimants had no other alternative but to continue in their activities of selling bare lots of land to any willing purchaser. In this context, I may also point out that it was put on the record that the Minister of Tourism, kindly, requested the Claimants to declare their intentions to the construction of a hotel in order to be in a position to defend the Claimants and convince the People\u2019s Assembly of a touristic nature of the project. (Meeting dated January 26, 1978, item 78/4).\n\nIX.\n\nBy a letter dated May 12, 1978, Mr. Munk, the Claimants\u2019 representative, addressed the Prime Minister informing him that \"in spite of these encouraging initial indications of success, *the protracted debates in the People\u2019s Assembly, the various committee hearings and the adverse world wide publicity have seriously impaired our efforts to create the required credibility to attract the increasingly needed overseas finance for the project\"* (Respondent\u2019s Annex F.38, p. 3), and he came to the conclusion that *\"we find it impossible under the present conditions to proceed rationally or economically with the planned implementation of the project.\"* (The above mentioned Annex, p. 4, Emphasis added)\n\nB. The events that occurred around the critical date May-June 1978\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnder this item, I intend first to review the two main events that were referred to in the letter of the Claimants to the Prime Minister dated May 12, 1978 to wit:\n\n- The debates in the People\u2019s Assembly and\n\n- the adverse world wide publicity\n\nto the effect, as stated in the letter, that these events \"seriously impaired our effort to create the required credibility to attract the increasingly needed overseas finance for the project.\"\n\nAfter that, it will be dealt with (ii) the measures taken by the Egyptian authorities in May-June 1978 and the reaction of the Claimants to these measures, and finally, I will indicate, in brief (iii) the subsequent conduct of the two parties during the stage of negotiation.\n\nThe Claimants admit that during 1977, opposition to the project developed in Egypt (Cls. Memorial p. 47). However, they explain that that opposition was part of a general political campaign directed less at the project than against the Government. The Claimants concede that the Government came to the defense of the project on several occasions:\n\ni. a- *The debates in the People\u2019s Assembly:*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n- On September 4, 1977 a letter from the Minister of Tourism was published in the Newspaper *Al Akhbar* by which the Minister responded to a series of articles written by Dr. N. Fouad criticizing the project. The Minister\u2019s letter specifically stated that \"the archaeological Board took part in the joint committees studying the project in the [Giza] Directorate. The Board approved plans to exploit the area in the tourist trade and arrangements to assign certain areas for [EGOTH] in accordance with a special presidential Act.\" (Cls. Memorial p. 48 and exh: 136 bis)\n\n- On September 10, 1977 the Minister of Tourism submitted to the People\u2019s Assembly a written answer to a series of questions from Members of the said Assembly. (Cls. Memorial p. 47 and exh: 87)\n\n- On February 7, 1978 during a debate in the People\u2019s Assembly, the Ministers of Tourism and of Economy unreservedly endorsed the project \"stating that the project is in the national interest of Egypt, that *no danger to antiquity areas existed, and that all laws relating to antiquities were being closely adhered to.\"* (Cls Memorial p. 50. Emphasis reproduced, and Cls. exh: 74)\n\n- In an interview given to the magazine \"sixth of October\", and published on April 23, 1978, President Sadat confirmed that the project had already been studied and approved and that it was \"a grave mistake\" for the Assembly to take up the question again, and he affirmed that doubts should not be permitted about the \"open-door\" policy of which the project was an example. (Cls Memorial pp. 50-51 and exh: 141)..\n\nIt is noteworthy to point out that the project was subject to multiple questions and interpellations before the People\u2019s Assembly.\n\nThe documents reveal that the Minister of Tourism was first questioned by a member of the People\u2019s Assembly about the terms of the agreements concluded with the Claimants, and the Minister answered to that question in writing in September 1977.\n\nNevertheless, \"interpellations\" were again addressed to both the Minister of Tourism and the Minister of Economy. Debates about these interpellations took place, before the People\u2019s Assembly, on February 7,1978. It is to be noted that interpellations constitue in the Egyptian Constitutional Law a means of control by the Assembly over the Executive, eventually resulting in the engagement of its responsibility. As noted \"les interpellations constituent un moyen de mettre enjeu la responsabilit\u00e9 du gouvernement devant le Parlement.\" (Institution politique et droit constitutionnel, M. Duverger, p. 172, Themis, P.U.F.). Under the Egyptian Constitution, the questions and the interpellations are governed by the provisions of articles 125 and 126. Article 125/2 provides as follows \"Debate on an interpellation shall take place at least seven days after its submission, except in the case of emergency as decided by the Assembly and with the Government\u2019s consent.\"\n\nAs pointed out by the Eminent Professor Duverger, the fondamental difference between questions and interpellations consists in the fact that the Assembly, after the debate about the interpellation, must vote either in favor or against, hence eventually engaging the responsibility of the competent Minister, the Prime Minister or eventually the whole cabinet. \"Mais une difference fondamentale subsiste; les questions ne donnent lieu \u00e0 aucun vote; au contraire, les interpellations se terminent par un vote exprimant la satisfaction de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e pour les explications fournies par le gouvernement, ou son m\u00e9contentement.\" (Duverger, op-cit, p. 172, and in the same vein, G. Burdeau, Droit constitutionnel et institutions politiques, p. 320, L.G.D.J. 1966). As for the outcome of the interpellations concerning the Claimants\u2019 project, the Assembly approved remitting the question, interpellations and the discussions to the \"Cultural information and touristic committee with the participation of both offices, the economical committee and the legislative committee to study the subject and present a report about it to the Assembly...\" (Summary of the minutes of the Assembly\u2019s session on February 7, 1978, Cls. exh; 74)\n\nOn March 12, 1978, the speaker of the People\u2019s Assembly, by a letter to the head of the above mentioned committees, suggested that the matter be studied in all its aspects by highly qualified technical experts. (Annex I to the report. Resp, annexes F 22 B and F 23). The experts committee was formed and began its assigned mission by April 5, 1978. (p. 1 of the report). The experts Committee finalized its findings in a \"Report,\" (Resp, annex F 23). That report deserves special attention since it treats about the different aspects of the project, and its elaborated by independent qualified technicians in different domains; *inter alia* the domains of law, economy and antiquities.\n\nThe question of whether or not the campaign against the project in the People\u2019s Assembly, was of a political nature may have a conclusive answer since the Central Auditory Agency (which as explained, is an independent body headed by an independent high official of the rank of Deputy Prime Minister and which reports directly to Parliament) independently prepared a report dated September 17,1977 which was sent to the People\u2019s Assembly (Resp. Annex F19). The said report contained information about the defects and illegality that affected the project both at the negotiation and at the implementation stages. Consequently the said report is enough evidence, in my opinion, to exclude any doubt about the real scope of the actions emanating from members of the People\u2019s Assembly. Moreover any unfounded political campaign would have by the time lost momentum. In this respect the campaign in the People\u2019s Assembly resulted in a resolution to the effect of the formation of a specialized committee entrusted with the study of the subject under all its aspects (called here in after the experts committee). Both reports, the one prepared by the Experts Committee and the other, elaborated by the central Auditory Agency (Resp. Annex F.23) will be dealt with later, as they have their weight in the consideration of points of facts and of Egyptian law brought to the attention of this Honorable Tribunal.\n\nIn this vein the Respondent argues that, even if the \"Antiquities\" reason had not arisen, the Respondent would have had the right and the obligation, on more than one ground, to terminate the project as then implemented by the Claimants (resp. Counter Reply Vol I, pp. 86-87). The Respondent also points out that if it would have failed to exercise that right or to fulfill that duty, Egyptian Courts would have seen to it that this was done, at the initiative of interested citizens. As a matter of fact, the Respondent explained that a demand for the nullification of the project has been brought to the court on the 1st of December 1977, (the Conseil d\u2019Et\u00e2t), before the 1978 Minister of Culture\u2019s *Arr\u00eat\u00e9* No. 90 of 1978 was issued (Resp. Annex F 64), in request for a summary stay of execution of the *Arr\u00eat\u00e9* No. 212 of 1975 and as principal demand to abrogate the said decree and consequently to rule to nullify or rescind the said Company\u2019s articles of incorporation. The decision of the Court concluded that \"whereas the result of these violations is to render null and void ETDC\u2019s articles of incorporation as well as Decree No. 212 for 1975... in consequence whereof the legal base of the company ceases to exist...\" (p. 50 of the Decision).\n\nThese facts put together, may answer by themselves the argument presented by the Claimants to the effect that \"it must again be stressed that these allegations did not appear until Respondent\u2019s representatives were given the task of constructing a defense, first in ICC proceedings and now again in the current forum\" (Cls. Reply. Footnote 18, p. 13).\n\ni. b- *The worldwide adverse publicity:*\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe Respondent acquiesced that the Pyramids Plateau project generated contrary reactions and protests (Resp. Counter Memorial Vol I p. 205). However, it points out that that was due to the conduct and behavior of the Claimants in the implementation of the project mainly on the Plateau proper. The documents of the case reveal that the Claimants reacted to the so-called adverse worldwide adverse publicity. They, in fact, presented a request *en defamation* against the French newspaper *Le Monde* before the Court of Paris. The Claimant at that case was Mr. Munk and he was attacking the Newspaper and the editor of an article entitled \"Promoteurs contre Pharaons; osera-t-on de construire au pied des Pyramides?\" published on March 25, 1978. The Court by a decision of February 5, 1979 dismissed the case (Resp. Annex F.39).\n\nThe Respondent presented certain documents which revealed: the concern of the international community as to the safeguard of the World Heritage and the worldwide reaction against the implementation of the project as conceived by the Claimants. In this respect the Respondent presented as samples:\n\n- The letter dated April 6, 1981 from the then Director General of UNESCO in which he reiterated the worldwide concern about the risks to which Memphis and its necropolis - and the zone of the Pyramids from Giza to Dahshour would have been exposed and the profound the relief that the Egyptian Government has taken active measures to protect that site\"... *ayant cette valeur universelle exceptionnelle...\"* (Resp. Annex E25, p. 2, Emphasis Added)\n\n- The article dated March 7, 1978, published in the London times entitled \"Save the Pyramids from the Jet Set Appeal.\" (Resp. Annex F.26)\n\n- The article dated March 25, 1978, published in Le Monde entitled \"Promoteurs contre Pharaons: Osera-t-on construire au pied des Pyramides\" (Resp. Annex F.27)\n\n- The letter dated October 10, 1978 from the Director General of UNESCO to the Director of *Le Monde* thanking him for the energy and devotion with which the Newspaper defended the world\u2019s cultural heritage in connection with the Pyramids Plateau Project (Resp. Annex 28). In fact, the letter contained that *\"aussi est-ce avec un v\u00e9ritable soulagement que j\u2019ai appris que l\u2019environnement des Pyramides sera pleinement respect\u00e9.\"* It is noteworthy to point out that the letter was dated before the formal registration of the site on the list of the World Heritage.\n\n- The article dated January 9, 1979 published in the French *\"Lib\u00e9ration\"* entitled *\"Le monde, les Pyramides et les promoteurs.\"* (Resp. Annex F.3O)\n\n- The article entitled \"Egyptian concern over plush city project by the Pyramids-Antiquities threat fear\" (Resp. Annex F.3l)\n\nii. *The measures taken by the Egyptian authorities at the critical date May-June 1978*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a preliminary observation, I may refer again to the letter of Mr. Munk dated May 12, 1978 to the Prime Minister in which he explained the difficulties \"to attract the increasingly needed overseas finance for the project (Resp. Annex F.38), due to the debates before the People\u2019s Assembly and the worldwide adverse publicity which \"have seriously impaired our efforts to create the *required credibility.\"* (Emphasis Added).\n\nIn this context, I may refer also to the Minutes of the second meeting of negotiations held during 24 and 26 of January 1979, where Mr. Mcgee and Mr. Zerfes insisted upon the housing activities advancing the argument that 75% of the Claimants\u2019 capital is held by the Khashoshgy interests and as they had been answered that under the provisions of law No. 43, SPP (ME) cannot be considered as Arab investors, they asked \"can we reincorporate and become all Arab\" (Resp. Annex F.65, p. 3).\n\nAll these facts put together may reveal ample confirmation as to the real concept the Claimants had for the project and the real nature of activities they were practicing. However, it has been demonstrated that the Claimants applied under law 43 as investors in a touristic project and, as such, committed themselves to the compliance with the provisions of the law as well as with their own consented obligations as stated in the application to the GIA. As to the financial capabilities for investment, it may be noteworthy to point out that the Claimants presented themselves to the GIA by \"the proposal on the development program\" (Cls. exh. 81).\n\nThe proposal indicated reference to Appendix (A) which is entitled \"Corporate summary of Southern Pacific properties.\" When the Respondent questioned the financial capabilities of SPP and asked formally that the Claimants produce that Appendix, the Claimants answered by a letter dated January 20, 1990 that \"we have confirmed with our clients that, like the Respondent, they cannot locate the Annexes attached to the April 1974 submission\" (Resp. Annex D.18). Whatever their investment capabilities for investment had been at that time, the 6ct remains that till May 1978 they seem to have failed to invest or to arrange finance for a single hotel and therefore were perhaps necessarily obliged to embark in and further commit themselves into the questionable activity of selling bare lots of land on the site. Moreover, the events that occurred later, but before the critical date, \"impaired seriously\" their credibility to arrange the needed finance as the Claimants themselves admitted in their letter dated May 12, 1978. This may suggest that at least from the date of that letter the Claimants were cognizant of the 6ct that they were in a situation *d\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 mat\u00e9rielle d\u2019ex\u00e9cution* of the titanic project they committed themselves to.\n\nIn the presentation of their case, the Claimants seem to give the impression to the effect that the Egyptian Authorities were conscious about the concept and nature of their activities, as developers. They repeatedly refer to the visit of a certain delegation to their project at Fiji, upon their invitation, and come to the conclusion that this fact reveals the acknowledgment and acquiescence of Egypt to the concept and nature of their activities in the Egyptian venture. The only worthy comment is that the legal appraisal of their activities in Egypt, should be effectuated in the light of their obligations under the rules of law No. 43, and the provisions of the engagements they obligated themselves with.\n\n- By a letter dated May 17, 1978, the Vice Minister of Tourism informed the Manager of SPP (ME) Mr. McLellan that \"we warn the company that if it does not carry out what had been agreed... if not we will take the steps which will compel the company to respect the regulations which are: 1. An Agreement should be made... on the form of the contract which will be made between the company and those who are going to exploit... 2. The stop immediately of any construction works within the monumental zone which is to be marked by the Land Survey Department\" (Resp. Annex F.37).\n\n- On May 27, 1978 a memoranda was prepared by the President of the Egyptian Antiquities Authority (Cls. Exh. 144) in which he informed the Minister of Information and Culture of the recommendation by the Board of E.A.A. to consider the region of A1 Giza Pyramids as a Public property (Antiquity). The memoranda contained justifications to the recommendation which consist in: 1. that \"the presence of Antiquities was confirmed in the Western side of A1 Giza Pyramids region which represents the Eastern part of the construction operation carried out... \" 2. \"The scientific evidence mentions the probability of Antiquities present in this important Antiquities region...\"3. \"The Antiquity and Cultural study of the nature of this ancient region imposes the need of a large and wide prohibited space at the A1 Giza Pyramids region...\"\n\n- On the same day, the Minister of Information and Culture issued Decree No. 90 of 1978 stating in Article (1) that \"the land surrounding the Pyramids which its boundaries and signs are shown in the attached memorandum and two maps, is considered of public property (Antiquity).\"\n\n- On May 28, 1978, the GIA informed the Chairman of ETDC that the Board of Directors of GIA decided on May 28, 1978 to drop the GIA\u2019s former approval dated July 20, 1975 concerning the Pyramids Plateau, for the impossibility of the execution of the project as a result of the issuance of Decree No. 90 of 1978 of the Minister of Information and Culture. (Cls. Exh. 146).\n\n- By telex dated May 29, 1978, Chase National Bank informed ETDC that the Bank received instructions from the Central Bank of Egypt to block ETDC\u2019s accounts and deposits pending further instructions. (Cls. exh. 147).\n\n- On May 29, 1978, EGOTH informed ETDC to stop work on the project. The letter stated that \"please be informed that because of the issuing of the GIA\u2019s Decree, thus dropping the agreement on the Pyramids Plateau project... I decided to write to you in order to take the suitable procedures to safeguard our interests and the rights of the investors and shareholders...\" (Cls. Exh. 148).\n\n- On May 30, 1978, EGOTH filed a request for sequestration of ETDC\u2019s assets before the Court of Giza. The Court accepted EGOTH\u2019s request and made a provisional order for sequestration \"on all the money put in the banks and at the Company\" (Cls. exh. 150).\n\n- At the Board of Directors\u2019 meeting on June 6, 1978, the Chairman of ETDC reviewed the administrative and judicial measures that took place, and it was agreed unanimously to convene an extraordinary meeting of the General Assembly of the company just after the ordinary meeting of June 20, 1978.\n\nAt the Board Meeting, Mr. Gilmour explained that the events of the past weeks were a great shock. He also pointed out that \"the attitude we felt always a very close mutual agreement of purpose and aim.\" He however stated that \"due to the events of a week ago it was important that our attitude be clearly understood as over the last year many misunderstandings had taken *and SPP suffered a credibility gap due to the press* which did not always illustrate the attitude in which we came to Egypt.\" (The Minutes p. 3). A representative of EGOTH was quoted saying \"that the Government intends to keep ETDC going for Ras El Hekma or any other place. The Government is very keen upon the rights of its investors.\"\n\nAs to the temporary measures, the Chairman explained that EGOTH brought a case before the Court of temporary injunctions of Giza, for a judicial sequestration and the nomination of a receiver, but during the hearings of Saturday, 3rd of June, EGOTH modified its demand in sequestration and asked for the appointment of two receivers, one neutral and the other being the Chairman of ETDC (who, to be reminded, is the representative of the Claimants) *\"Having full financial powers to safeguard the funds and property of ETDC and the rights of the shareholders and purchasers''* (the Minutes, p. 5). This request was to render an injunction *\"to appoint these two receivers until the meeting of the General Assembly on 20th June.\u2019\u2019* (the Minutes. Item 78/23. p. 5)\n\nNoteworthy is the fact that during the meeting it was unanimously agreed to appoint a committee of three persons: one representative of both EGOTH and SPP and an impartial third. In answer to questions by Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Birchall, the representatives of EGOTH affirmed that the appointment of the committee \"would be in place of the sequestration and the blocking would be lifted.\" And that \"the request to the Court will be dropped after the formation of the Committee and naturally it means that the claim of 10m. will be dropped.\" Also in answer to Mr. Gilmour\u2019s question about the rationale of EGOTH\u2019s claim, a representative of EGOTH stated that \"it was only precautionary, temporary measure.\" (The Minutes, p. 7)\n\n- On June 19, 1978, Presidential Decree No. 267 of 1978 was issued. On the basis of the Decree of the Minister of Information and Culture No. 90 of 1978, the Presidential Decree provided in article (1) that \"the Presidential Decree 475/1975 to be cancelled regarding the assignment of the lands on the Pyramids Plateau in Giza for Touristic exploitation\" (Cls. exh. 151)\n\n- Contrary to what had been agreed upon, Mr. McGee, in his capacity as the authorized representative of SPP (ME) sent a memoranda dated June 20, 1978 in which he stated \"we concur that a Court order should be immediately sought. 1. Confirming the power of the receiver to instruct him to call General Assemblies at the request of either shareholders and to attend General Assemblies in lieu of Board. And that upon the issuance of such order all members of the existing Board should be discharged.\" (Resp. Annex F.44)\n\nThe Respondent explained, while the Claimants kept silent, that when the Giza Court decided on June 19, 1978 to appoint, the two proposed persons as co-custodians to act jointly, the Chairman of ETDC who was also the representative of the Claimants declined to serve as co-custodian (Resp. Counter Memorial Vol I, p. 236), instead, the representative of SPP (ME) in Court requested a court order confirming the power of the EGOTH designee to serve as sole receiver.\n\n- On July 12, 1978, the judicial custodian issued resolution No. 1 of 1978 (Cls. Exh. 150). That resolution referred to \"the resolution of the trio committee appointed by resolution No. 23 for the year 1978 of the Board of ETDC to manage the affairs of the company prior to the appointment of the judicial custodian, and for organizing the work of ETDC during the period of the custodianship.\" In this respect, the Respondent explains that after opting for cooperation, the Claimants shifted their attitude to a \"refus de toute coop\u00e9ration avec les autorit\u00e9s Egyptiennes\" (Resp. M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9ponse. Vol II p. 115)\n\nThis statement may have ground upon the fact, later revealed during the first meeting of negotiation between the two parties where Mr. McGee, representing the Claimants, was quoted as saying *\"ETDC can be successful, but the combination of ETDC and SPP has lost its credibility\"* Resp. Annex F.56 p. 2. Emphasis added).\n\niii. *The Subsequent conduct of the two parties during the stage of negotiations:*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Respondent presented in the present case documents relating to subsequent contacts with the Claimants. The contents of these documents were subject of discussions and explanations by both parties during the hearings before this Tribunal in September 1990. However, the veracity of the contents of these documents seem not to be challenged or surmised.\n\nIn Annex F.65, the Respondent presented a document entitled \"Minutes of Five Meetings of GIA representatives and the Egyptian \u2018Legal Group\u2019 with representatives of SPP, dated 24-28 January 1979.\" Present to the meetings were, beside the representatives of Egypt, the representatives of SPP (ME), and as such represented \"their shareholders who are Prince Nawaf and Prince Fawaz and Mr. Khashoshgy.\"\n\n1.\n\nIt appears from the *proc\u00e8s verbal* of the first meeting that the meetings was held at the initiative of the Minister of Tourism since Mr. McLellan expressed that \"He is grateful that the Ministry of Tourism had invited this delegation to Egypt.\" The Claimants point of view can be summarized as follows:\n\n- That the problem may be solved in a manner to ensure Egypt\u2019s reputation as a host country for foreign investments.\n\n- That the cancellation of the project caused SPP serious financial losses and damages.\n\n- That the Press attack harmed the reputation of the Claimants, therefore, as explained by Mr. McGee *\"Any settlement must include a statement by the Egyptian Government to heal his clients\u2019 damaged reputation.\"*\n\n- That SPP prefers not to continue as a partner in ETDC, since the combination ETDC and SPP lost its credibility.\n\n- That replacing the land does not put ETDC on its fact since it spent 9.5 m. U.S. Dollars in preliminary engineering.\n\n- That the estimated damage amounts to 35 m. U.S. Dollars.\n\n- That a settlement be reached in a short period of time.\n\n- That the basis for compensation is Egypt\u2019s breach of contracted obligations.\n\nOn the other hand, the representatives of the Respondent pointed out:\n\n- That Egypt and EGOTH did not violate any contracted obligations or Egyptian law.\n\n- That the Minister of Culture did not break the law by issuing Decree No. 90 of 1978.\n\n- That the contract of ETDC is governed by Egyptian law and that the said law should be applied concerning compensation.\n\n- That ETDC will be compensated according to Law No. 215 to 1951 concerning monuments.\n\n- That Egypt and EGOTH have the right for compensation because the foreign partner violated the contract and laws in force. The violations being established in both the report of the Central Authority for Auditing, and that of the Experts Committee.\n\n- However, the Egyptian side expressed willingness to find a settlement provided the whole contract and statutes of ETDC are revised in compliance with the provisions of the Law No. 1 of 1973 concerning touristic establishments and law No. 43.\n\n2.\n\nAt the second meeting, the Egyptian side pointed out the violations committed by the Claimants in their housing activities. In response to a statement by the Egyptian side to the effect that the concept for the future would necessarily drop the housing activities, Mr. McGee the representative of the Claimants was quoted as saying \"The law says that Arab Capital can do something with housing and 75% of our capital is held by the Khashoshgy interests. Or we would like to go to the house and have a special law.\" Mr. Zarf\u00e0s also asked about the possibility of reincorporation and becoming all Arab. To all that the Egyptian side reaffirmed that both partners EGOTH and SPP do not have the right to exercise housing activities in Egypt, EGOTH being a tourist company and as such is forbidden to exercise housing activities.\n\nIn answer to the interrogation of the Egyptian side as regards what Claimants meant by \"residential tourism,\" Mr. McLellan answered that \"It seems to me, there is no dispute about the commercial viability of what was done.\" At that meeting the project of Ras-El-Hekma was discussed, and the Egyptian side objected to a suggestion that 95% of the cost of construction of a hotel at that site be financed by loans. The Egyptian side pointed out that \"it is unacceptable that ETDC work as an intermediary between Egypt and international financial institutions, *so it should be a venture where the investors do some parts of financing.\"* (Emphasis added).\n\nIn answer to a question about the alternative site of the project, the Egyptian representatives stated that \"we will apply law 215 of 1951 according to this law the Ministry of Culture is studying the land which will be given to ETDC.\"\n\n3.\n\nAt the third meeting, Mr. Zerfas, representative of the Claimants, pointed out that they \"will be responding to a general of concepts and problems to make ETDC work under Egyptian law;\"\n\n- ETDC should be a touristic company, he was quoted as saying \"we finally agree that this should be the mission of ETDC.\"\n\n- An economic plan for the carrying out of activities of ETDC is vital.\n\n- A feasibility for a financial plan.\n\nHe also pointed out that the Claimants need:\n\n- Indemnification for ETDC.\n\n- Consider the site location.\n\n- Make a master plan to fit the site.\n\n4.\n\nAt the fifth meeting the Claimants\u2019 representatives asked for time to consult with the shareholders, and to make a full plan of feasibility study.\n\n5.\n\nThe negotiations seem to have been resumed on 16 May 1979 (Resp. Annex E69).\n\nThe *proc\u00e8s verbal* of the meeting reveals that two subjects were under discussion: the compensation and/or the means of cooperation in ETDC\u2019s activities. A substitute land was offered to ETDC in case the foreign partner intended to cooperate. Was also discussed the contents of two documents each prepared by a party and communicated to the other for the study and comment.\n\nMr. McLellan, the Claimants\u2019 representative, pointed out that the losses incurred by SPP amount to 7.3 million Dollars, however the Claimants accept to limit their compensation to 4 million, and the rest to be considered as their contribution in the company. And as the Egyptian side questioned some figures included in the note prepared by the Claimants and asked that all supporting documents be presented, in response, Mr. McLellan advanced that the value of SPP (ME) was estimated at 35 m. and subject to increase, and that was the amount of losses.\n\nThe Egyptian side raised questions about the figures advanced by the Claimants and asked that certain sums be excluded. These sums were:\n\n- 1,333,244 Dollars representing \"leur quote part dans les d\u00e9penses de constitution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\"\n\n- 3,555,285 Dollars \"qui repr\u00e9sentent des d\u00e9penses de d\u00e9veloppement qui ne concernent pas ETDC.\"\n\nThe proc\u00e8s-verbal contains that in response Mr. McLellan had said that \"il n\u2019est pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 entrer dans une discussion concernant ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement d\u00e9pens\u00e9, ni \u00e0 entrer dans des n\u00e9gociations les concernant.\" (Proc\u00e8s Verbal, p. 7). However, it seems that, the Egyptian side offered to pay 1.5 million Dollars against the invested capital \"comme contre partie des capitaux investis, ce dans le cas de la continuation de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\" (Proc\u00e8s verbal, p. 11) and that \"la compensation principale \u00e0 ETDC sera un terrain alternatif...\" (Proc\u00e8s verbal, p. 12).\n\n6.\n\nThe issue of the proposed land of substitute has been debated in the written submission, and during the hearings before this Tribunal in September 1990. The Claimants asserted that the proposed site was unappealing, located twenty kilometers remote from the Pyramids Plateau. The Claimants pointed out that neither the offer nor the site was defined with precision. They refer to a visit that took place by the Arbitrators of the ICC Tribunal, during which they \"were shown a location in the sixth of October city (which covered a very large territory) more than 20 kilometers from the Pyramids Plateau site and with characteristics entirely inappropriate for the tourist destination concept.\" (Cls. Reply, p. 88).\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent presented maps indicating the location of the proposed site, as well as technical studies which contain evaluation of that site and a comparison with the site of the Plateau (Resp. Annex, F.51). The Respondent also pointed out that the proposed site \"corresponds closely to the one of the four sites (the site on the Fayoum Road) to which the Claimants had agreed upon in the Heads of Agreement of September 1974.\" (Respondent Counter Memorial, Vol I, p. 243).\n\nThe Respondent explained that its offer for a land of substitute is relevant as regards both the legal issue and the factual considerations. The Respondent advances that it had the legal right to modify the contract in the sake of public interest on the basis of an established principle of administrative law. And that on the other hand the offer reveals the goodwill for further cooperation with the Claimants who, alleges the Respondent, declined the offer without even giving it serious consideration.\n\n7.\n\nWithout going through any legal considerations, as regards the nature of any eventual contract that may have been concluded between the two parties to the present dispute, I may only point out that the criteria of administrative contract should be seeked in the Egyptian administrative law, and that under Egyptian administrative law, for a contract to be qualified as administrative, it should satisfy, as a general rule, three elements: the administration being a party to it, related to a public service, and containing exorbitant clauses *\"Clauses Exhorbitantes.\"* (S. El Tamawy. General Principles of Administrative Contracts, 1984, p. 54 in Arabic).\n\nHowever, any contract related to the use of public domain, is by its nature, considered an administrative contract subject to the application of the rules governing administrative contracts. (The Supreme Administrative Court, case 1965 for the judicial year 6, 31.3.1962).\n\n8.\n\nAs regards the factual consideration; it seems that the review of the *proc\u00e8s verbaux* of the meetings may reveal the divergencies that separated the two parties *inter alia* the reimbursement of the Claimants, the nature of the eventual project and its financing. Therefore, the issue of the substitute site was not at the core of the negotiations.\n\nIt seems, moreover, that the proposed site was conditional upon agreement about the activities that should be practiced in the framework of the touristic nature of the project.\n\nHowever, if the suitability of the site of substitute is to be given weight in the impartial consideration of This Tribunal of the whole relationship between the Parties in dispute, before, during and after the critical date May-June 1978, the Tribunal should evaluate the issue of suitability in the light of the realities revealed by the documents and studies submitted to it, and hence to reject such gratuitous argument to the effect that the subsequent non implementation of touristic projects on the proposed site of substitute is evidence for its unsuitability. Otherwise, it could have been argued that the site on the Pyramids Plateau proper, where the Claimants were implementing their project, is to be considered by its turn unsuitable since from times immemorial it has never been exploited whether in touristic or other activities.\n\n9.\n\nTo conclude upon the issue concerning the critical date and the subsequent conduct of the parties, I may refer to two documents:\n\n- The SPP (ME) memorandum dated June 20, 1978, prepared by its authorized representative, Mr. James MacGee which stated the following: \"we concur that a court order should be immediately sought 1. confirming the power of EGOTH designed to serve as sole receiver in view of the fact that the co-receiver has declined to serve. 2. Expanding the power of the Receiver to instruct him to call General Assemblies at the request of either shareholder... and that upon issuance of such order all members of the existing Board should be discharged.\" (Resp. Annex F.44)\n\n- The telex dated January 8, 1982, from the Chairman of SPP (ME) to the Judicial Custodian of ETDC, in which SPP (ME) asked that \"ETDC and shareholders meeting be put off pending the Arbitrator\u2019s decision.\" The allusion was made to the case before the ICC, and in the telex SPP (ME) expressed its view that since the ICC Tribunal may make its award conditional on SPP (ME)\u2019s surrendering its shareholding in ETDC, therefore it would \"be obvious that any decision taken on behalf of ETDC should await the pending Decision of the Arbitration Tribunal\" and that \"the substitution of land at the Sixth of October site was proposed and rejected two years ago, and we cannot conceive of any reasons why it should now be urgent to reconsider it.\" (Resp. Annex F.43).\n\n4. *The allegations related to irregular contacts and corruption*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. General preliminary considerations:\n--------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\n\"... It cannot be contested that there exists a general principle of law recognized by civilized nations that contracts which seriously violate *bones mores* or international public policy are invalid or least unenforceable and that they cannot be sanctioned by courts or arbitrators.\"\n\nBy that statement of 1963, the honorable judge Largergren, acting as sole arbitrator, set the genesis of a basic rule to govern international transactions. Such a rule was necessitated by the 6ct that \"notwithstanding the efforts of national laws and international agencies, financial and other inducements are an established part of the process of obtaining contracts in some parts of the world.\" (A. Redfern and M. Hunter, Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration, p. 107-108. Also Kosheri and Leboulanger, L\u2019Arbitrage face \u00e0 la Corruption et au trafic d\u2019influence, Rev. Arb. (1984), p. 3).\n\nInternational agencies were active in detecting and combating these practices (for example OCED \"Guidelines for Multinational Corporation,\" para 7; The Draft International Convention on Illicit Payments, UN doc. E/1979/ 104, May 25, 1979, and ICC document No. 315 \"Extortion and Bribery in Business Transaction\" and document No. 480/2 \"Les Commissions illicites; D\u00e9finition, Traitement Juridique et Fiscale.\") Relevant concern seems to be better demonstrated by reference to the \"World Development Report for the Year 1991\" issued by the World Bank. The report indicates that corruption is an evil that undermines the administration s capacity and may even lead to its paralysis. The report also points out that the phenomenon is not confined to the administration of developing countries, however low salaries may be detected as one of the reasons behind these practices (The report in its Arabic version, p. 165).\n\n2.\n\nIn this vein, it is noteworthy to point out that the international community saw to it that, in its setting of codification of the rules governing treaties, be embodied the basic principles relating to the issue of fraud and corruption and their consequences as regards the validity of the treaty. Article (49) of the \"Convention de Vienne sur le Droit des Trait\u00e9s\" provides that \"si un \u00e9tat a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure un trait\u00e9 par la conduite frauduleuse d\u2019un autre \u00e9tat ayant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation, il peut invoquer le dol corne viciant son consentement \u00e0 \u00eatre li\u00e9 par le trait\u00e9,\" and article (50) of the same convention reads as follows \"si l\u2019expression du consentement d\u2019un \u00e9tat \u00e0 \u00eatre li\u00e9 par un trait\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu au moyen de la corruption de son repr\u00e9sentant par l\u2019acte direct ou indirect d\u2019un autre \u00e9tat ayant particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation, l\u2019\u00e9tat peut invoquer cette corruption comme viciant son consentement \u00e0 \u00eatre li\u00e9 par le trait\u00e9.\" This aspect of the convention has been qualified as \"Moralisation du Droit\" as explains the eminent professor Reuter who stated in this respect that \"nul ne saurait s\u2019y tromper: la partie progressive de la convention de Vienne est bien celle qui concerne les cas de nullit\u00e9 des engagements internationaux, et qui expose la sanction moderne des vices du consentement et la notion de *jus cogens.\"* (Pr. Reuter, La Convention de Vienne sur le Droit des Trait\u00e9s, Paris 1970, p. 22).\n\n3.\n\nArticle (11) Bis of Law 43 of 1974 concerning investments of Arab and foreign capital reads as follows \"the projects referred to in the first paragraph of the previous article are subject to the restrictions pertaining to employees of government and representative bodies set forth in article (95) to (98) of Law No. 26 of 1954 and to the prohibitions set forth in article (28) of Law 38 of 1972 with regards to members of the People\u2019s Assembly. Prohibited activities in accordance with the provision referred to in the previous article include undertaking any private activity, directly or indirectly or through an intermediary, including consultant activities, if during the year prior to leaving office or employment, the Minister or public official was involved in licensing the establishment of those projects or supervising their activity. In the application of the provisions of this law, the term \u2018minister\u2019 shall refer to the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Ministers and Deputy Ministers.\n\nThe documents presented to this Tribunal reveal that, as far back as 1977, competent authorities, mainly the independent Central Auditing Authority, had suspicions about circumstances surrounding the contractual process that occurred with the Claimants. In fact, by a letter dated November 10, 1977 concerning the Claimants\u2019 project, the Head of the Central Auditing Authority formally asked the Minister of Tourism to \"proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate avec tous les responsables de cette affaire, et ce par quoi elle a aboutit comme cons\u00e9quence contraire \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du pays, et qui ont d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 les buts poursuivis par l\u2019accord.\" (Resp. Annex F.63). That request was based upon the observations and conclusions contained in a report prepared by the said authority after reviewing the whole contractual relationship and the activities of the joint venture under the Claimants\u2019 management.\n\nMoreover, the Experts\u2019 Committee which was constituted under the auspices of the People\u2019s Assembly and entrusted with the study of the various aspects of the Claimants\u2019 project, came to conclusions which corroborate the findings of the Central Auditing Authority (Resp. Annex F.23). In this respect, it is noteworthy to point out that the above mentioned Experts\u2019 Committee submitted in its conclusions that \"it would like to point out that the different stages which this project went through... *reflect many gaps and excesses and impulsiveness which violated the rules of the law and the constitution besides the inaccuracy and the dishonesty of the display.\"* (Resp. Annex F.23, p. 116).\n\nThe findings of both the Central Auditing Authority, in 1977, and the Experts\u2019 Committee, in 1978, alongside with an impartial evaluation of the sequence of facts may convey a preliminary answer to the question about whether or not the Claimants were, in fact and in law, *bona fide* developers whom the misfortune led to face a feltering, misfortunate and decadent administration.\n\n4.\n\nIn case of evidence to corruption, a question arises about what would be the legal consequences thereupon. It is noteworthy, that concerning contracts, the objects of which are illegal, i.e. related to illegal commissions or traffic of influence, it is debated whether to consider the issue as related to the arbitrability of the case or rather to assume jurisdiction yet refuse the claim on the basis of illegality (Yves Derains, Analyse de Sentences Arbitrales, les Commissions Illicites, ICC publication No. 480/2, p. 61 et s., and also Redfern and Hunter opcit p. 108).\n\nb. The Respondent\u2019s Allegations:\n--------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Respondent consecrated a whole section of its Counter-Reply entitled \"The Claimants\u2019 Corrupting Practices\" the Respondent refers first to what it alleges was the general business practice of the Claimants outside Egypt and quote a dominant representative of the Claimants stating on an official record that \"if I have a million and a half dollars applications pending, I am not going to take a chance in not pleasing some political party\" (Resp. CounterMemorial, p. 46 and Counter-Reply p. 113 and Annex F.5 B, p. 91 which is a photocopy of the minutes of the standing committee of the Nova Scotia Legislation on Industry, March 18, 1969). The Respondent also points out that the same Claimants\u2019 representative also admitted that a certain Mr. X, functionary of Industrial Estate Limited (apparently a subsidiary or a public organization controlled by the Novia Scotia Government) was appointed director of the private company controlled by the Claimants while they were negotiating with Industrial Estate Limited a business deal involving a loan of 1 Million to the Claimants\u2019 company. The Respondent also presented in its exhibits a documentation about the business background of the Claimants which reveals, as the Respondent asserts, the critical financial situation the Claimants were suffering at the time they entered into their agreement with the Respondent and engaged themselves to large investments. In this respect the Respondent asked that the Claimants produce the document containing their financial capabilities annexed to their first proposal submitted to the Egyptian Administration in April 1974. (Resp. Letter dated December 22, 1989, Annex D.17). The Claimants answered by a letter dated January 23,1990, that \"we have conferred with our client that, like the Respondent, they cannot locate the annexures attached to the April 1974 submission.\" (Resp. Annex D.18). And the Respondent seems to rely upon that answer as a supplemental proof that the Claimants mis-introduced themselves to the Egyptian administration. The Respondent also stresses upon the critical financial situation of the Claimants, at the time they introduced themselves to the Egyptian Administration, as demonstrated by the \"Report on the Financial History of Southern Pacific Properties Group\" prepared by Pete Marwik McLintock and Co. (Resp. Annex F.l). From that report, the Respondent alleges that \"SPP was debt ridden even as it was dangling before Egyptian eyes visions of one billion, 700 million and 400 million United States not Hong Kong Dollars in foreign investment. It also shows how the Egyptian venture was used and planned to be used, to get SPP out of its desperate situation.\" (Resp. Counter-Memorial pp. 29-30)\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent advances that \"hints of understandings and arrangements multiply even before the Claimants set foot in the country\" in this context, the Respondent seems to rely upon the affidavit of Mr. Gilmour before the ICC arbitration which contains information that Mr. Gilmour was invited to visit Egypt during a \"chance meeting\" in London with the then President Sadat\u2019s Secretary for External Liaisons, and who received him in the presidential palace the following weekend. The Respondent explains that that Secretary happened to be the one and same who transmitted the \"oral\" approval of President Sadat as regards the extension of the duration of the usufruct rights to be accorded to the Claimants\u2019 joint venture to 99 years instead of 50, and that upon a letter of request to that effect from Mr. Gilmour, directly to the President, dated May 19, 1975. (Resp. Annex F.54). In fact, it is on the record that by a letter dated May 20, 1975, that is the very next day to the above mentioned letter of Mr. Gilmour, dated May 19, the referred to Secretary informed the Minister of Tourism that \"veuillez bien \u00eatre inform\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir soumis la question \u00e0 M. le Pr\u00e9sident, celui-ci a consenti \u00e0 ce que l\u2019usufruit de ces terrains soit de 99 ans.\"\n\nIn this respect, I may comment upon a fact which is that the same above mentioned letter contained information about that \"en ce qui concerne l\u2019ordonnance pr\u00e9sidentielle, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidence du Conseil des Ministres *et ce apr\u00e8s signature.\"* (Resp. Annex F.55, Emphasis added). It would be noteworthy to point out that the above mentioned letter reveals the following:\n\n- That while the draft of a presidential decree concerning the allocation of the use of the land to EGOTH was presented by the Minister of Tourism on March 30, 1975, it took but one day to obtain a \"verbal\" approval as regards the extension to 99 years instead of 50.\n\n- That the \"verbal\" approval was accorded without presentation of whatsoever supporting document nor any feasibility study that would have justified the request, contained in a letter, for that extension.\n\n- The legality of that extension being questionable, the subsequent approval of the project by the Board of Directors of the GIA did not fail to specify that its decision was conditional upon that it does not eventually contravene Egyptian law.\n\n- That the above mentioned letter contained at least misinformation about the signature by the President of the Decree allocating the use of the land to EGOTH for touristic purposes since it was proved on the record that that Decree had been effectively signed on May 22, 1975, that is two days after the date of the Secretary\u2019s letter. (Resp. Annex F.14, The Official Gazette, p. 437).\n\n- These facts, with others, may have some relevance as to the apprehension of related facts concerning the above mentioned Presidential Decree mainly the \"mysterious vanishing\" of the maps referred to in the Presidential Decree that were never published or presented to any administrative agency.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent stresses specifically upon what it called the Claimants\u2019 pattern of doing business in Egypt, and presents as an example among others the case of the Official of the Egyptian Tourist Bureau in London who was instrumental in introducing the Claimants to Egypt yet was later appointed member of the Board of ETDC as a representative of the Claimants. The Respondent suggests that these examples, in which names as well as official fonctions are stated, should be significant in the evaluation of the whole relationship between the parties.\n\nIn this respect, I may express my point of view that it would have been necessary for this Tribunal to study, scrutinize and evaluate the allegations presented by the Respondent in this context, had the issue not been sufficiently exposed by the explanations and statements by both parties concerning the development costs in response to the Tribunal\u2019s procedural order of February 13, 1991, as will be later explained in detail.\n\n4.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent presents as a material proof for corruption what is denominated by the Claimants as development costs. The Respondent explained:\n\n- That a meeting held on May 5, 1975, during the negotiation for *a* settlement between the parties, the Claimants advanced that they had spent an amount of US Dollars 3,555,285 as development expenses and agreed that in case the Egyptian Government accepts to pay compensation, the Claimants would provide it with the supporting documents.\n\n- However, the Claimants advanced before the Present Tribunal that they incurred \"pre expropriation development costs\" amounting to 2,532,714 US Dollars. And as supporting documents they presented a letter by Coopers and Lybrand dated January 19, 1981 (Cls. exh. 170). Also Mr. Birchall in an undated affidavit (Cls. exh. 171) stated that after review of the relevant documents and specifically of SPP (ME)\u2019s development costs had found that the total pre-cancellation development costs were of 2,532,714 US Dollars.\n\n- That the discrepancy between the above mentioned figures was never explained.\n\n- That \"if the Claimants had really incurred such costs, the conclusion must be drawn that for four years, the life span of the project, they were careful to hide that\" to the conclusion that \"these development costs, or at least a major part of them, could not have been other than the means with which the Claimants used their well known, well practiced talent for persuasion. Persuasion to gain unmerited advantages, to violate with impunity a countless number of the laws of the land... and to set aside all the solemn engagements and promises with which they paved their way to a project meant by the Egyptian Government to contribute to economic development and willed by the Claimants to pursue an unproductive land speculation path.\" (Resp. Counter-Reply, Vol I, p. 136)\n\nc. The Claimants\u2019 explanations:\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn their part, the Claimants consider that the Respondent\u2019s presentation that SPP introduced itself into Egypt in an irregular manner is false. In this context, the Claimants rely upon a letter from the Minister of Tourism published in *Al Akhbar* newspaper (Cls. exh. 136) containing information that EGOTH entered into the contract with SPP after enquiring about the said company through the Egyptian Embassy in London and the General Egyptian Consulate in Hong Kong as well as through the relevant security authorities and the banks (Cls. Reply, p. 60). Claimants also refer, in this respect, to both the Minister of Tourism\u2019s written submission to the People\u2019s Assembly of September 10, 1977 (Cls. exh. 87) and to the content of the answers given by the said Minister to the interpellations before the People\u2019s Assembly on February 7, 1978 (Cls. exh. 74), which are as the Claimants explained, self telling evidence to the conclusion that the allegations presented by the Respondent before this Tribunal concerning irregular contacts are unfounded.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that a full review of SPP\u2019s financial and corporate history can only be that SPP before it arrived in Egypt, as well as after, was a successful tourism organization with a proven track record, headed by individuals skilled in corporate finance and with shareholders including some of the most important corporations involved in its line of business. In this vein, the Claimants pointed out that as regards the cash flows for the Egyptian operations, a sum of 20 million Dollars was estimated as the required initial funding for that program, and that SPP arranged the required financing through a 12 million treasury share issue to Triad Holding Corporation, and through the 8.75 million sale of some 25% of SPP (ME) to two members of the Saudi Royal Family.\n\nI may point out in this respect that the record does not reveal the *raison sociale* of the above mentioned Triad holding, however, it seems that that company acted as intermediary in an armament deal to the Saudi Arabia as revealed by the case Northrop Corp. Vs. Triad brought before the Court of Appeals of California (1987) where the question of the legality of the commissions paid to Triad, on the occasion of that deal, was at the core of the case. (P. Mayer, Loi Applicable et Respect des Lois de Police, ICC Publication 480/2, p. 54).\n\nd. The Tribunal\u2019s procedural order of February 13, 1991:\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis honorable Tribunal, after consideration of the submitted documents and of the explanations and requests of the parties ordered that: \"a- The Claimants shall submit to the Tribunal and to the Respondent, within one month, a document indicating the nature, date and amount of the above referenced development costs, including the names of the recipients of payments in excess of US Dollars 20,000 and a confirmation that these sums were legitimately and actually expended for the project and were directly connected with it. The document shall also contain an explanation of why these costs were not charged to or were not directly recovered from ETDC.\"\n\n- The Claimants responded to the Tribunal\u2019s order and explained in a letter dated April 20, 1991 that in item B(4), of their final conclusions and prayer for relief of September 21, 1990, which relate to pre-cancellation development costs amounting to 2,254,000 US Dollars, and that \"arises as a result of the expenditures by SPP (ME) pre-cancellation of 2,943,398 US Dollars of which it was reimbursed 689,377 US Dollars by ETDC leaving a balance of 2,254,000 US Dollars,\" and that the amount claimed in B(5) arises from \"expenditures, post cancellation by SPP (ME) of 1,010,461 US Dollars with no reimbursement from ETDC (which honored no obligations post cancellation). Of this amount, Claimants claim 623,000 US Dollars under item B(5) having eliminated from this category legal fees in the amount of 387,015 US Dollars.\" The Claimants annexed to their letter the affidavit of Mr. Birchall in which he explained that certain accounting documents were lost, and that was due to the fact'that before the incorporation of SPP (ME), most of the documents were spread between Fiji and Australia and that from 1976 the accounting for SPP (ME) was basically being carried out from the UK \"so when the UK office was closed in 1979, *what was considered non-essential was destroyed to avoid the high cost of transportation to Canada\"* (Affidavit p. 2, Emphasis added). However, Mr. Birchall stated that *\"certain records were found and permitted an extrapolation of expenses for those periods when no such information was available.\"* (The above mentioned affidavit, Emphasis added).\n\n- By a note dated June 20, 1991, the Respondent questioned the explanations given by the Claimants in response to the Tribunal\u2019s procedural order on the contention that they are: *\"insuffisantes,\" \"contiennent de graves contradictions ou m\u00eame contrev\u00e9rit\u00e9s\"* and *\"inacceptables\"* (note p.3). The Respondent in the first place pointed out that the Claimants brought their case, for indemnification against the Respondent, before the ICC Court of Arbitration on December 19, 1978 (that is before the closure of the Claimants\u2019 London office which did not occur, as they stated, until 1979). The Respondent advances that it would have not escaped the Claimants to keep the necessary documents supporting their claim. Respondent also advances that the testimonies before this Tribunal of Mr. McLellan and Mr. Blainey, from Coopers and Lybrand, obviously suggest that all documents concerning development costs were in existence at least till 1981. The Respondent also pointed out that the sum of 1,545,338 US Dollars to which Mr. Birchall declared that he failed to find any supporting documents represents, in fact, about half of the amount of the claim concerning Development Costs. The Respondent concluded that \"dans ces conditions, et *eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 toutes les autres consid\u00e9rations et motifs* que la RAE a rappel\u00e9 tant *ci-dessus (par exemple paiement \u00e0 Mr. Raouf) que dans ses \u00e9critures et explications orales pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes concernant la corruption,* la RAE ne peut qu\u2019affirmer de plus fort que des *\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuves graves, pr\u00e9cis et concordants* existent quant \u00e0 la corruption active de la part de SPP dans le cadre du projet objet du pr\u00e9sent litige.\" (The above mentioned note p. 16, Emphasis reproduced).\n\n- In my opinion, it is noteworthy to point out that the letter of Coopers and Lybrand, dated January 19, 1981, suggests that it was necessarily prepared upon supporting documents. The final explanation advanced by the Claimants, to the effect of the loss or destruction of supporting documents concerning development costs in 1979 of a sum exceeding 1.5 million dollars, raises at least one question: whether or not the letter by Coopers and Lybrand, prepared in January 1981, was supported by the necessary documentation then the documents would have been in existence at least until 1981 that is to say after the alleged loss or destruction of the documents in 1979. Moreover, it seems for the least hazardous to found any conclusions upon the contents of the affidavit of Mr. Birchall annexed to the Claimants\u2019 note dated April 20, 1991, since Mr. Birchall himself honestly stated that \"I am furnishing this affidavit after having reviewed the books and records now available to me, *and based on my knowledge and remembrance of those records* to respond to paragraph 6 (a) of the Tribunal\u2019s procedural order of February 13, 1991.\" (Cls. submission dated April 1991, Vol I, Emphasis added). In any event, no supporting documents were ever presented neither to this Tribunal nor to the Respondent for examination and/or eventual comment. The Respondent, in this respect, asked formally from this Tribunal that the supporting documents related to every and any amount of development *costs* be presented before this Tribunal for examination either by itself or by any expert it entrusts.\n\ne.\n--\n\nWithout going through the legal aspects of the issue related to the development costs, I may point out that whether or not the explanations advanced by the Claimants are an appropriate and adequate response to the letter and spirit of the Tribunal\u2019s procedural order of February 13, 1991, the fact remains that the Respondent on the one hand maintains and stresses upon its allegations concerning corruption, considering that the Claimants failed to present the supporting documents concerning at least an amount of 1.5 million dollars of the so-called development costs and on the other contends that in any case the Claimants have no standing to any part of the claim concerning development costs since they failed to present any conclusive supporting document. It is noteworthy to point out that the report dated June 19, 1991, prepared by Mr. Renshall, annexed to the Respondents note dated June 20, 1991, indicates that the *\"total for which Claimants are unable to supply the names of recipients amounts to 1,545,338 US Dollars.\"* The said report, however, adds that \"the remainder of the expenses (excluding interest) which Mr. Birchall had identified by payee amounts to 1,719,144 US Dollars. *I have seen no document to support these payments and therefore no evidence that they were incurred for the benefit of the Pyramids Oasis Project.\"* (The Report, p. 4, Emphasis added). Moreover, Mr. Renshall\u2019s report discusses various items shown in the schedules attached to Mr. Birchall\u2019s affidavit commenting upon various items i.e. upon the item denominated foreign exchange difference in the amount of 289,947 US Dollars which, as Mr. Renshall pointed out, lacks any explanation or necessary supporting information. Mr. Renshall\u2019s report also contained information that:\n\n- The \"letter from Coopers and Lybrand does not give a confirmation that the costs were actually incurred and directly connected with the Pyramids Oasis Project.\u2019\u2019\n\n- that \"the signing of an unqualified audit report does not mean, in itself that the confirmation required by the Tribunal that the costs were \u2018legitimately and actually expended for the project and were directly connected with it\u2019 has been given.\" (The Report, p. 6).\n\n- and that \"Mr. Birchall does not indicate what documents are available and in the absence of better information, I do not consider from an accounting point of view that the case has been made out that the payments were incurred wholly or mainly for the benefit of the Pyramids Oasis Project\". (The Report, p. 9)\n\nf. As regards the issue of the so-called development costs, it is worth noting, from the outset, that:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe issue in question raises two points of law; the one relating to the legal weight that should be accorded to the Claimants\u2019 explanation in response to the procedural order of February 13, 1991, as regards the allegations of corruption, and the other relates to the legal ground upon which an amount, *if* any, may be accorded to the Claimants in the light of their explanations in this regard, that is without the presentation and/or eventual examination of supporting documents, neither by this Honorable Tribunal nor by the Respondent. A question of law necessarily needs an answer concerning which party should assume the fact of the loss or destruction of supporting documents to a claim?\n\nIn any event, it seems that nothing in the Respondent\u2019s explanations and the annexed report would justify an *a priori* dismissal of all Respondent\u2019s contentions even as regards the sums allegedly identified by payee. In this respect, I beg differ from the Majority Award which contains a statement to the effect that \"the report also points out that the information filed by the Claimants in response to the Tribunal\u2019s procedural order of February 13, 1991, identified US$ 1,719,000 of the claimed cost by payee, but that the recipients of an additional US$1,545,000 of the claimed costs were not identified. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it would not be appropriate to award development costs for which the Claimants are unable to identify the payee. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to award development costs only in the amount of US$ 1,719,000.\" (The Majority Award, pp. 79-80 [p. 385 of this issue]). To my humble knowledge, all and any claimed sum should be supported by documents and that the burden of proof rests upon the claiming party. Was it then rather required from the Respondent to prove that \"the remainder claimed sums\" were not actually incurred nor directly connected to the benefit of the Pyramids Oasis Project? Moreover, how can a defendant party legally and logically argue about the authenticity of claimed sums in the absence of any supporting document to the claim? And finally, can the information contained in Mr. Birchall\u2019s affidavit to the effect that, at least in part, his presentation was based upon knowledge and remembrance be considered enough legal ground to accord payment of the contested amount?\n\n2.\n\nThat an impartial evaluation of the issue seems to necessitate recalling the sequences of the relationship that took place between the parties in the light of the proper relevance of the Claimants\u2019 final explanations as regards the question of the development costs. It seems of equal importance to establish, scrutinize and, hence, evaluate, not only WHAT did happen in fact, but also HOW it happened. It may be more relevant to the apprehension of the case to pay careful attention to how the change of site occurred, how the duration of the usufruct rights was extended, how Presidential Decree 475 for the year 1975 was issued, how come that the maps to that Decree were never published yet the usufruct rights were registered upon the identification and the responsibility of EGOTH, how the Claimants managed their activities through the joint venture, how they acted as regards the judicial claim that had been undertaken by their partner, EGOTH, and how they proceeded during the negotiations for an out of court settlement. And what finally was their attitude as regards the development costs before this Tribunal in view of the fact of the \"loss\" or \"destruction\" of supporting documents, the fact that was never brought before the Tribunal\u2019s attention but in response to its procedural order of February 13, 1991, that is after the final oral hearings of September 1990.\n\n3.\n\nThat the competent authorities in Egypt, as far back as 1977, had more than suspicions about the Claimants\u2019 project and the conduct of Egyptian officials connected to it. In this vein, I may point out to the letter of the Head of the Central Auditing Authority to the Minister of Tourism asking him to proceed in the necessary investigations concerning the determination of the responsible or responsibles for the violations committed in relation to the Claimants\u2019 project. (Resp. Annex F.63). That letter, as already explained, was based upon the conclusions of the competent departments of the said authority as regards the various aspects that vitiated the process of both the agreement with the Claimants and its implementation. In this respect, it is noteworthy to point out that the report of the Experts\u2019 Committee, constituted under the auspices of the People\u2019s Assembly, finalized in 1978, corroborated the conclusions contained in the Central Auditing Authority\u2019s report. These facts may be enough evidence in reply to the Claimants\u2019 allegation to the effect that the Respondent is presenting its argument about irregular contacts and corruption for the sole purpose of evading eventual condemnation for indemnification.\n\nIII. *THE LAW*\n--------------\n\n1. *The legal ground for the Tribunal\u2019s competence and the scope of the present dispute:*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI.\n\nIn its request for arbitration dated August 20, 1984, SPP (ME) requested the Tribunal to:\n\na. Determine that ARE has undertaken obligations and incurred duties in respect to SPP (ME) both according to terms of Law No. 43 and according to the Heads of Agreement of September 1974 specifically entered into by a member of its government, as well as by a supplemental Agreement \"approved, agreed and ratified\" by the same Member of its Government.\n\nb. Determine that ARE violated its obligations thereunder.\n\nc. Adopt and incorporate as its own the pertinent findings of fact made by the ICC arbitrary Tribunal concerning SPP (ME)\u2019s performance of its obligations under its agreements, the dismissal of EGOTH\u2019s counter-claim therein, and the acts bringing about termination of the investment project.\n\nd. Determine the liability of the ARE to compensate SPP (ME) for the termination of its investment agreements and to award the full measure of indemnification to SPP (ME) on account of the destruction of its investment, increased by the additional costs, including all direct and indirect costs of the present proceedings, occasioned by ARE\u2019s wrongful refusal to honor the ICC award of February 16, 1983, or otherwise compensate SPP (ME), as well as interest at commercial rate.\n\nII.\n\nIn its preliminary decision upon jurisdiction of November 27, 1985, this Tribunal did not find it necessary to pronounce upon the objection raised by the Respondent to the effect that article (8) of law 1974 upon which the alleged jurisdiction of ICSID is based does not apply to the present case. The Respondent based its objection upon the fact that the language of Article (8) providing that \"Investment disputes in respect of the implementation of the provisions of this law shall...\" mandates to restrict its application to disputes concerning the non-performance of obligations under Law 43, as distinct from disputes involving non-performance of obligations under a contract. The Respondent, in this context referred to the Decision of the Paris Court of Appeals wherein the Court stated that Article (8) \"... ne vise au surplus que les seules contestations ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019investissement et concernant la mise en ex\u00e9cution des dispositions de la loi en cause, mais non celles de tel ou tel contract.\"\n\nThis Tribunal found, however, a *prima facia* ground for its competence since, as it stated, \"the alleged breach by the Government of Egypt of contractual obligations emanating from the Heads of Agreement constitutes at the same time a breach of a legal provision enunciated in Article 7 of law No. 43\" and the Tribunal stated that \"In this respect, it is quite clear that expropriation, the legitimacy of which is not being contested, if not accompanied by fair compensation, amounts to confiscation which is prohibited by Law No. 43.\"\n\nIt results from that decision:\n\n- That the Tribunal did not decide upon the Respondent\u2019s objection concerning the limited scope of article (8) to the effect that it does not cover disputes emanating from breach of contracts.\n\n- That even at that early stage of the proceedings the Tribunal was convinced that the \"legitimacy\" of the measures taken by the Respondent were not contested.\n\nIII.\n\nIn later stages of the proceedings, before this Tribunal, the Claimants radically changed their cause of action and explained in their final submission that the basis of the Respondent\u2019s liability resides in the provision of article (7) of Law 43 which reads as follows \"Projects may not be nationalized or confiscated. The assets of such projects cannot be seized, blocked, confiscated or sequestrated except by judicial procedures.\" (Cls. Reply, p. 115). It results from that clear language that the present dispute is therefore based upon, and confined to, the scope of article (7) of Law 43 upon which this Tribunal already relied, in its findings concerning ICSID jurisdiction and its own competence. It may be noteworthy, in this respect, to point out that, while the Tribunal decided that the basis of its competence rests upon the provisions of article (7) of law 43 that is to say that the present dispute arises from an administrative act of expropriation which amounted in the Tribunal\u2019s view to confiscation since not accompanied by compensation, the Majority Award nevertheless *inter alia* accorded to the Claimants an interest of 5% rather than 4% on the ground that \"with respect to the rate of interest the Tribunal is of the view that it should be 5% rather than 4%. The argument that the Heads of Agreement was not a commercial contract is not conclusive because the present claim is not an action for a breach of that contract but rather one seeking compensation for the expropriation of the rights of a commercial enterprise for the development of tourism\" (The Majority Award p. 87 [pp. 390-391 of this issue]). It seems to me however that any expropriation act is manifestly not of commercial nature and compensation due upon that act cannot be considered compensation related to commercial issue. Moreover, the Majority Award attributed the interest starting from May 28, 1978, of a 5% rate in reference to article (226) of the Civil Code of Egypt. In this respect, I may only refer to the language of the said article (226) which reads in pertinent parts as follows \"if the subject of obligation constitutes a sum of money and such amount was defined at the time of the claim and the debtor delays the payment of the damages, he shall be bound to pay to the creditor by way of damages for the delay an interest of 4% in civil cases and 5% in commercial cases. These interests shall apply from the date they are claimed at court...\" It is noteworthy that the Majority Award stated that it was according interests not as moratory but rather compensatory, however, it based its findings as regards the interest rate upon the provisions of article (226) of the Civil Code which rule the issue of moratory interests. In any event, it seems that the Majority Award did overlook the fact that if the alleged measures undertaken by the Respondent date back to May 28, 1978, upon which date it computed the compensatory interests together with the application of the mechanism for monetary adjustment for currency devaluation, the fact is that the Claimants did not bring their claim for compensation before ICSID\u2019s Jurisdiction until August 24, 1984. The Claimants seeked compensation in the first place before the ICC Court of Arbitration in December 1978 and were apparently relying upon that court\u2019s competence over their claim since, in their request for arbitration before ICSID, they asked for indemnification *inter alia for* \"ARE\u2019s wrongful refusal to honor the ICC award of February 16, 1983.\" The issue about the finality of that award was pending before the French Court of Appeals and subsequently before the French Court of Cassation which finally pronounced upon the invalidity of the ICC Award. This attitude was the determinant factor in this Tribunal\u2019s first preliminary decision upon jurisdiction where it decided to stay the proceedings before it till the issue of the validity of the ICC Award be finally settled. The proceedings before this Tribunal did not resume until 1987. If it may be considered legitimate for the Claimants to seek compensation before a competent forum, their mis-identification of that forum and the time it took them to address the competent one while, at the same time, defending the validity of the ICC Award before other jurisdictions, however the consequences thereupon could not rest solely upon the Respondent. Moreover, it is evident from the record that the Claimants were reluctant, during the phase of negotiation for an out of court settlement with the Respondent starting from 1979, to produce supportive documents to their evaluation of compensation mainly concerning sums under the item of development costs.\n\nIV.\n\nThe correct legal construction of article (8) of law 43 is that it \"does not purport to cover contractual disputes between different investing parties, but rather disputes between investors and a Government agency relating to the interpretation of the law itself.\" (M.H. Davis, Business Law in Egypt, p. 137). This interpretation is corroborated by the statement, contained in \"the legal guide to investment in Egypt\" (Cls. exh. 77, p. 39), which reads as follows \"Article (8) does not apply to all controversies in which the investor may be a party; rather it applies only to investment disputes... the subject of the dispute must relate to the provision of the law, such as those relating to the interpretation of a tax exemption or approval issued by the authority, disputes which do not fell within the scope of article (8) are to be settled in the ordinary courts of law or in administrative courts.\" Therefore, this Tribunal should decide that the Counter-Claim presented by the Respondent fells beyond ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence. The Respondent based its counter-claim, as explained in its M\u00e9moires en R\u00e9plique Vol II (pp. 155-157) upon alleged defaults imputed to the Claimants in execution, or rather non-execution of their obligations under the Heads of Agreements and subsequent contracts. The Counter-Claim being based upon alleged breach of contractual obligations, should be considered out of the scope of ICSID jurisdiction and this Tribunal\u2019s competence. In any event, since the Tribunal did not reject the objection to its competence raised by the Respondent as regards the scope of the said article (8), the Respondent would have been estopped from advancing in the same dispute and before the same Tribunal two different constructions for the same article (8) of law 43.\n\n2. *The Parties to the present dispute and the receivability of SPP (ME) 's claim:*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI.\n\nIt is to be recalled that the request for the present arbitration was presented by SPP (ME) by a letter to the Secretary General of ICSID dated August 20, 1984. The request contained information to the effect that the agreements entered into by SPP i.e., the Heads of Agreement and the Contract of December 1974 \"were thus subsequently assigned by Southern Pacific Properties Limited to SPP (ME).\" (The request for arbitration, p.4) and that SPP (ME) informed the Minister of Tourism by a letter dated August 15, 1983, that it \"intended to accept the opportunity of availing itself of the ICSID jurisdiction to which the ARE had consented.\" Later, during the proceedings before this Tribunal, SPP had been joined, subject to Egypt\u2019s reservation of jurisdictional defenses. In a dissenting opinion, joined to this Tribunal\u2019s decision of April 14, 1988,1 explained my point of view to the effect that the joinder of SPP did not satisfy the requirements of the Washington Convention as well as the rules of arbitration, and should be ruled, therefore, inadmissible.\n\nII.\n\nThe Respondent argues that SPP (ME) is not an \"investor\" in the framework of law 43, since the request for the approval of the GIA concerning the project was submitted to the GIA on behalf of SPP and EGOTH, and that the subsequent approvals of the GIA were accorded to SPP. (Resp. M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9ponse, Vol II, p. 9-11). The Respondent explains that the language of article (1) of law 43 supports its argument since the said article reads as follows \"The term \u2018project\u2019 in application of the provisions of this law shall mean any activity... and approved by the Board of Directors of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones.\"\n\nThe Respondent also points out the lack of proof to the effect that the GIA was ever informed of any assignment that would have occurred to the benefit of SPP (ME) or *a fortiori* that the GIA had ever examined SPP (ME)\u2019s *statut juridique* or approved to convey to it the benefits of law 43. For their part, the Claimants draw the attention to the fact that SPP (ME) was the company that realized the investment, and that at least as early as December 1974, the Respondent was aware that SPP intended to carry out the foreign investment and to exercise its contractual rights and obligations, through an affiliated company, since the December 12, 1974 contract contained a provision which reads as follows \"it is understood that SPP will be incorporating a holding company to own its shareholdings in ETDC and it is agreed that SPP shall have the right to assign its rights... duties and obligations under this agreement to this company...\" The Claimants also explain that from and after that date the Respondent accepted performance by SPP (ME) and accepted its expenditures, loans and other activities for the benefit of the project. Moreover, as the Claimants point out, legal recognition of this state took the form of the contracts entered into by EGOTH and SPP (ME), and finally by the Ministerial Decree No. 212 of 1975 (Cls. exh. 114) officially authorizing the formation of ETDC between SPP (ME) and EGOTH. The Claimants conclude that SPP (ME) had been recognized in law and in fact as a foreign investor under law 43.\n\nIn my opinion, qualification, as investor, under law 43 necessitates two prerequisites: on the one hand, the reunion of the three main criteria relating to the project activities, local participation and the nature of the capital invested, and on the other hand, the obtaining of the approval of the Board of Directors of the GIA. In the present dispute, the contract of December 1974 or any of its provisions cannot be, as such, evidence to the effect that any assignment is to be *ipso jure* opposite to the GIA since it was not a party to that contract nor did it approve its provisions. Moreover, it results from the clear language of Law No. 43 and its executive regulations that the approval of the Board of Directors of the GIA is based *inter alia* upon a subjective criterion relating to the applicant, his eventual partners and their experience and references, as well as detailed information about the capital to be invested in or contributed to the project (for example article 19 of the executive regulations of Law 43 which reads in pertinent parts as follows \"An application... shall be submitted to the General Authority for Investment and free Zone on the form designated for this purpose *and shall contain basically* the following information: a) information about the applicant, the applicant\u2019s partners... and their experiences and references, b)... c) detailed information about the capital to be invested or contributed to the project...,\" and article 24 which provides that *\"projects approved* by the Authority *shall be implemented and conducted in accordance with the basic conditions and objectives set forth in their respective applications as approved...*\") Article 27 of Law 43 is conclusive, it reads in pertinent parts as follows *\"... The Board of Directors of the Authority shall have the Authority to approve applications submitted for investment...*\" (Emphasis added). Thereupon, the Board of Directors of the GIA is the sole competent authority to accord approvals for investment projects. Therefore, and under the provisions of law 43 and its executive regulations, any assignment or transfer of an approved project should be submitted and approved by the Board of Directors of the GIA which would have full discretion in this context. It is noteworthy that no assignment or transfer of rights did ever legally occur in favor of SPP (ME) by SPP. It was also brought to the attention of this Tribunal that the capital of SPP (ME) amounted to the equivalent of 200 U.S. Dollars (two hundred) the fact that was never proved to be brought to the knowledge of neither the Board of Directors of the GIA nor to EGOTH, the Claimants\u2019 Egyptian partner. Since no legal assignment of rights did ever occur between SPP and SPP (ME) it is inconceivable to allege that the Board of Directors of the GIA approved an assignment that never existed. Moreover, there is no evidence on the record that SPP (ME) ever applied to the GIA in due form as necessitated by law 43 and its executive regulations, referred to above. Even the memorandum prepared by the Vice President of the GIA for the issuance of the Decree No. 212 of the Minister of Economy refers explicitly to the approval of the Board of Directors of the GIA of July 20, 1975 which was accorded to SPP and not to SPP (ME). The approval of the Board of Directors of the GIA as regards the project and the investor is in fact and in law a fondamental legal requirement to the qualification under law 43. Any other act cannot, legally speaking, convey the qualification of investor under law 43, be it the act of the Minister of Economy himself or acts emanating from any GIA department. The fact that SPP (ME) invested or participated with an Egyptian party in any project does not, as such, convey to it the qualification of investor under the specific law 43.\n\nIt results from the above that SPP (ME) has no standing to avail itself of a *statut juridique* under law 43. Consequently, SPP (ME)\u2019s claim should be considered out of the scope of ICSID jurisdiction. It is noteworthy to be recalled that the alleged consent of the Respondent to ICSID jurisdiction is presumably embodied in article (8) of law 43 which provides in pertinent part that \"investment disputes in respect of the implementation of the provisions of this law shall be settled... or within the framework of the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes...\"\n\nIn case of a conclusion to the contrary, *par impossible,* it seems that an issue of law would have needed to be settled to wit; what would have been the outcome as regards this Tribunal\u2019s competence over the present dispute in the light of the provisions of article (25) of the Washington Convention concerning ICSID\u2019s scope of jurisdiction *rationae materia* as well as under the provisions of law 43 which embody the alleged consent of the Host State, in consideration to the proper legal nature of Claimants\u2019 activities and whether or not they are to be considered investors in the framework of both the Washington Convention and the Egyptian law 43.\n\nHowever, and for the sake of argument, it will be dealt, in the next two sections, with the issues related to the Applicable Law and the application of the law to the facts of the case.\n\n3. *The applicable law :*\n-------------------------\n\nI.\n\nIn my opinion, it is mandatory to decide upon the issue of whether or not the parties to the present dispute agreed upon the choice of the Applicable law. It seems however that the Majority Award was founded upon the assumption that there is no legal necessity to decide upon the fact of whether or not the parties had agreed upon the choice of the applicable law. The Majority Award stated that \"in the Tribunal\u2019s view the parties disagreement as to the manner in which article (42) is to be applied has very little if any practical significance...,\" and that \"finally even accepting the Respondent\u2019s view that the parties have implicitly agreed to apply Egyptian law such an agreement cannot entirely exclude the direct applicability of international law in certain situations. The law of ARE, like all municipal legal systems, is not complete or exhaustive, and where *a lacunae* occurs it cannot be said that there is agreement as to the application of a rule of law which, *ex hypothesi,* does not exist. In such case, it must be said that there is absence of agreement and consequently the second sentence of article 42 (1) would come into play.\" (The Majority Award, pp. 3031 [p. 351 of this issue]). As a consequence, to that statement, the Majority Award after stating that \"... no provision of the Civil Code or other Legislation concerning the *dies a quo* applies to compensatory interest for a yet to be determined amount of compensation arising out of an act of expropriation\" comes to the conclusion that \"given this *lacunae* it is legitimate to apply the logical and moral principles usually applied in the case of expropriation, namely that the *dies a quo* is the date on which the dispossession effectively took place...\" (The Majority Award, p. 90 [p. 393 of this issue]). From the outset that statement concerning a *lacunae* in \"the Civil Code or other legislation\" as regards the *dies a quo* seems to be enough indication to the fact that the Majority Award, opted for and effectively decided upon the issue of the choice of the applicable law in the sense that the parties to the present dispute did not agree upon that choice, however without indicating to my humble knowledge the arguments to its findings in this respect. Otherwise, the Majority Award, in case it was reached that there does not exist any legislative provision concerning the *dies a quo for* compensatory interests, would have had recourse to the application of the mechanism provided for, as will be later explained in some detail, in article (1) of the Civil Code which reads in pertinent parts as follows\"... 2. A d\u00e9faut d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative applicable, le juge statura d\u2019apr\u00e8s la coutume, et \u00e0 son d\u00e9feut, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les principes du droit musulman. A d\u00e9faut de ces principes, le juge aura recours au droit naturel et aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9.\" In view of the clear language of the said article (1) of the Civil Code, I honestly could not conceive the possibility of a *lacunae* in the Egyptian Legal System which would have led to *non liquet.* My understanding of the Majority Award in this respect is corroborated by the statement of the said award to the effect that \"when municipal law contains a lacunae, or international law is violated by the exclusive application of municipal law, the Tribunal is bound in accordance with article (42) of the Washington Convention to apply direedy the relevant principles and rules of international law.\" (The Majority Award, p. 32 [p. 352 of this issue]). Noteworthy, as will be explained later, that principles of international law should be construed, in the framework of article (42) of the Washington Convention, as meaning specific rules of international law. In any event, the plain language of article (42/1) first sentence, does not give room but to the exclusive application of the law that the parties have chosen as the applicable law to govern their relationship.\n\nII.\n\nThe issue of the applicable law is to be decided in the light of the provisions of article 42 of the Washington Convention, which provides in pertinent parts that \"(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, The Tribunal shall apply the law of the contracting State Party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable. (2) The Tribunal may not bring in a finding of *non liquet* on the ground of silence or obscurity of the law.\"\n\nIII.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants\u2019 arguments consist in saying that:\n\n(a) there does not exist an agreement between the parties as to the choice of the law applicable to the dispute,\n\n(b) and that they are entitled to the application of certain rules of international law mainly concerning the principles and standards of indemnification due to SPP (ME) resulting from the respondent\u2019s action in \"ARE\u2019s exercise of its sovereign powers, which destroyed its property rights (including its contract rights)\" (Cls. reply p. 140).\n\nHowever, the Claimants explain that \"within its scope of application, law No. 43 is the specific statute providing a legal regime applicable to foreign investors\" (Cls. Reply p. 140). It seems, therefore, obvious that the Claimants base their claim for compensation upon their status as foreign investors under law No. 43 of the year 1974. This legal status results necessarily from the application of that law, and hence is subject to, conditioned and determined by, the provisions of that law. A cursory review of the provisions of law No. 43 reveals the following:\n\n(a) Article (2) of the promulgating law states that \"Matters not covered by this law are subject to the applicable laws and regulations.\" Laws and regulations referred to in this article, are uncontestedly, the Egyptian laws and regulations in force.\n\n(b) Article (6) of the law stipulates, in pertinent parts, that \"irrespective of the nationality or domicile of their owners, projects in the Arab Republic of Egypt approved under the provision of this law shall enjoy the guarantees and privileges set forth in this law.\"\n\n(c) Article (9) of the law reads as follows *\"Companies enjoying the provisions of this law shall be deemed to belong to the private sector of economy, irrespective of the legal nature of the indigenous capital participating therein...*\" (Emphasis Added). Moreover, investment brochures, emanating from the GIA, and relied upon by the claimants, especially in their pleadings concerning the issue of ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction over the present dispute, contain reference to some selected Egyptian laws which may be directly or indirectly applicable to foreign investment (legal guide to investment in Egypt, 1977, p. 54. Cls. exh: 15).\n\nIV.\n\nIt results from the provisions of Law 43, that the status of an \"investment,\" of an \"investor,\" and of a \"project\" under that law is a legal status defined by the law itself. This legal status consists on the one hand of the enjoyment of rights as well as the submission to obligations emanating from the provisions of law No. 43 to the extent established by their content, and on the other by the submission to all other rules in force in the land. The legal status of an \"investor\" and an \"investment\" under the provisions of law No. 43 is not to be considered as a separate, remote, and isolate status from the whole legal national system. This conclusion is, in my opinion, an inevitable direct legal consequence resulting from the provisions of article (2) of the decree enacting law No. 43 referred to above, and corroborated by the provisions of article (9) which specify that the \"companies enjoying the provisions of this law shall be deemed to belong to the private sector of the economy...\" and the provisions of article (10) which reads as follows \"project enjoying the provisions of this law shall not be subject to law No. 73 of 1973.\" Therefore, it seems evident that law No. 43 does but provide for certain rules to be applicable to approved projects. A review of the whole text of Law No. 43 confirms the conclusion that the approved projects make part of the national economy and are subjected to the applicable legal system, wherever law No. 43 does not provide for a specific treatment. This specific treatment is referred to, clearly in the text, as limited exceptions to the applicable laws of the land. All other matters not covered or governed, by an explicit provision of the law No. 43, are therefore governed by Egyptian laws and regulations in force. This aspect of law No. 43, as a limited exception to the laws and regulations is clearly explained in Egyptian jurisprudence. In fact the Supreme Administrative Court (The highest instance of the \u2018Conseil d\u2019Et\u00e2t\u2019) had, in many occasions, confirmed this legal nature of law No. 43, and hence concluded, in case of silence of Law No. 43, to the applicability of all other Egyptian laws and regulations to the \"project.\" (Decision of February the 1st, 1986 in the cases Nos. 1231 and 1235 of the judicial year No. 31). To assert, therefore that law No. 43 is by itself a declared intention of Egypt as to the law applicable to the investment in the framework of the said law, seems to be an evident, logical conclusion. Article (8) of law No. 43 which reads, in pertinent parts as follows \"Investment disputes in respect of the implementation of the provisions of this law shall be settled *in a manner to be agreed upon...*\" (emphasis added) mandates an interpretation to the effect that all that can be agreed upon is the manner of settlement, i.e., the forum qualified to adjudicate the dispute. This provision does not give room to a choice of the material rules governing a dispute. Noteworthy, in this respect, that provisions of treaties entered into by Egypt are considered part of the Egyptian law in appliance of the mechanism provided for in article (151) of the constitution which reads as follows: \"They [the treaties] shall have the force of law after their conclusion, ratification and publication according to the established procedure.\" The issue of the applicable law comes, therefore, to the answer to the question whether or not the claimants agreed upon the choice of the law of the land as the applicable law to their contractual relationship and their legal status as investors under law No. 43.\n\nThe answer to this question, in my opinion, is in the affirmative since the Claimants expressed clearly their adherence and submission to the *statut l\u00e9gal* provided by Law No. 43. In fact, in the recital to the September Heads of Agreement, which constitutes an integral part of the agreement as provided for in article (1) of the said agreement, it is stated that \"this agreement is issued in accordance with... and law No. 43 for the year 1974 relating to Arab and foreign funds invested in the A.R.E....\" SPP also presented an application to the Board of Directors of the GIA, to the effect of its qualification as a foreign investor under the provisions oflaw No. 43. In the light of these *actes juridiques,* it seems obviously clear that, the claimants (SPP and subsequently its *defacto* assignee SPP (ME)) accepted to adhere to and benefit from the legal status provided for by the provisions of the Law No. 43, with the legal consequences that emanate from that adherence which is the acceptance of law No. 43 and consequently of all the laws and regulations of the land as the applicable law to govern their investment in Egypt. This acceptance reveals, in my opinion, a clear choice by the Claimants of the Egyptian Law as the applicable law in the meaning of article (42/1) of the Washington Convention. In this vein, I may refer to the explanation of Professor Ren\u00e9 David that \"la soumission d\u2019un \u00e9tat \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage du CIRDI ne doit pas n\u00e9cessairement r\u00e9sulter d\u2019un contrat qui lie cet \u00e9tat \u00e0 un investisseur \u00e9tranger; *elle peut r\u00e9sulter d\u2019une loi de cet \u00e9tat qui r\u00e9git le contrat,* et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 laquelle certains types de diff\u00e9rends seront ipso jure justiciable de l\u2019arbitrage du CIRDI.\" (Pr. R. David, L\u2019Arbitrage dans le Commerce International, 1981, pp. 223-224. Emphasis added).\n\nIn a dissenting opinion to this Tribunal\u2019s second preliminary decision upon jurisdiction, I explained the *nature juridique* of the mechanism provided for in Law 43 to the conclusion that the approval of an application for a project by the Board of Directors of the GIA is qualified in law as *un acte condition* which triggers the application of the whole status accorded to the approved project that is the application of Law 43 as regards matters specified by its provisions as well as the application of all the laws of the land to any other matter not covered by the provisions of that Law.\n\nAs a result to that conclusion, there can be no legal ground, in my opinion, to apply article (42/1) second sentence of the Washington Convention to any issue of the present dispute, most importantly there is no ground to have recourse, in order to justify application of other rules than those provided for under the law of Egypt, to a presumed *lacunae,* neither under the provisions of article (42/1) first sentence of the Convention nor under the provisions of article (1) of the Egyptian Civil Code enacted by law 131 of 1948 which provides for a mandatory rule to be applied, that is \"1. Legislative provisions are applicable to all issues which are covered by these provisions, in text and content. 2. In the absence of applicable legislative provisions the judge shall pronounce his sentence in accordance with usage. In the absence of usage his sentence shall be issued according to principles of Islamic Legislation. And in the absence of Islamic Legislative provisions applicable thereto the judge shall rule in accordance with natural law provisions and rules of justice.\"\n\nV.\n\nHowever, and admitting *arguendo,* that there does not exist an agreement as to the choice of the applicable law by the parties to the present dispute, I may advance that the Tribunal, in conformity with article (42/1) second phrase, should have the obligation to determine:\n\na) How to apply international law rules (or principles as will be explained later), in compliance with the provisions of Article 42/1 second phrase of the Convention, and,\n\nb) Which rules (or principles) of international law should be applied.\n\nIn this respect, the commentators to the convention present different views as regards the application of the rules of international law in the case of absence of agreement upon the applicable law. Mr. Delaume advances that \"... *l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de l\u2019article 42 n'implique aucun ordre chronologique dans l\u2019examen par le tribunal du droit mat\u00e9riel et des normes internationaux applicables. Le tribunal peut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cet examen de fa\u00e7on successive ou simultan\u00e9e.\"* (Delaume, Le Centre International pour le R\u00e8glement des Diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux investissements (CIRDI), Clunet, 1982, p. 829). To the contrary, Mr. Broches explains that \"My submission as to the relationship between the law of the host state and the international law in the second sentence of article (42/1) is as follows: The tribunal will first look at the law of the host state and that law will in first instance be applied to the merits of the dispute. Then the result will be tested against international law...\" (A. Broches, The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, Recueil des Cours, 1972, II, p. 392). The doctrinal controversy seems to have received answer, in a recent decision emanating from an *ad hoc* committee constituted under the auspices of ICSID (the decision dated the 3rd of May 1985 over the petition of Kl\u00f4ckner Industries), where it has been stated that the arbitrators can have recourse to \"the principles of the international law only after having researched and established the contents of the law of the state party to the dispute... and after having applied the relevant rules of that law.\" However, the above mentioned decision explains that the provision of article (42/1) second phrase of the Convention endows the principles of international law with a double role: either complementary (in the case of a *lacuna* in the law of the state), or corrective (in the case where this law does not conform in all respects to the principles of international law). As to the issue related to the identification of the international rules to be applied, *arguendo* in the present dispute, it should be noted that the parties to this dispute refer to the provisions of the Convention in the two authentic English and French versions. Article (42/1) of the Convention in its English version speaks about \"rules\" of the international law as may be applicable, while the French version treats of *\"principes\"* meaning principles of international law. Mr. Broches commenting the difference of language used in these two authentic versions explains that \"it seems to me in any event that principles cannot have been intended or have the effect of excluding specific \u2018rules.\u2019\" (Broches, opcit, p. 391)\n\nVI.\n\nIn any event, and in case *par impossible* that article 42/1 phrase two of the Convention is to be applied in the present dispute, it should be first proceeded, with the identification of pertinent rules of Egyptian law. Recourse to international rules (or principles), in the case they do not form part of Egyptian law by the effect of their integration in the legal Egyptian system in application to the provision of article 151 of the constitution referred to above, cannot be recoursed to, or directly applied to the present case unless it is primarily proved that there does exist one or the other case permitting their application as already explained above i.e., in cases of a presumed *lacuna* in the national law and/or of non-conformity with imperative international rules.\n\nWithout going through a doctrinal debate about the question of *lacuna* in national laws, I may only point out that it should always be borne in mind to differentiate between law and legislative provisions. Under the Egyptian legal system, like the French system, the rules and principles of administrative law, for example, emanate mainly from the jurisprudence of the *Conseil D\u2019Et\u00e2t.* Moreover, the provisions of Article (1) of the Civil Code enacted by law No. 131 of 1948 provides for that \"... 2. A d\u00e9faut d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative applicable, le juge statura d\u2019apr\u00e8s la coutume, et \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les principes du droit Musulman. A d\u00e9faut de ces principes, le juge aura recours au droit naturel et aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9.\" (Code Civil, extrait du Journal Officiel No. 108 du 29 juillet 1948). The legislative provisions are thus the main but not the only source of law in Egypt.\n\nIn any case, the mechanism provided for by Article 42/1 second phrase does not, in my opinion, give room to a subjective appreciation and evaluation as regards the content of a national law. Otherwise, the whole mechanism would result in a derogation to the letter and spirit of the Convention by draining the reference to, I may even say the predominance of, the application of the host state law enunciated in article 42/1 second phrase, off any significance.\n\n4. *The Application of the Law: the juris dictio*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore proceeding with the legal arguments, it is noteworthy to point out that a thorough apprehension of the intricate facts of the present dispute militates *for* an overall appreciation based upon a comprehensive survey of these facts and of the sequences of the whole relationship that developed, indeed always to the Respondent\u2019s disadvantage. To cut the facts of the whole relationship into separate and compartimented incidents seems, in my opinion, to be misleading to the determination of the pertinent *faits juridiques* the matter that would, as a consequence, necessarily result in the misidentification of the proper rule of law that should be applied. This consideration is meant to be both an apology and a justification for the lengthy review consecrated to the facts in this opinion.\n\nOn the other hand, this section consecrated to the application of the law is intended only to indicate, in brief, the basic legal arguments for the outcome of the present dispute and that, as may be recalled, in view of the fact explained above that I consider the whole case felling out of the scope of ICSID jurisdiction and hence of the present Tribunal\u2019s competence.\n\nI.\n\nThe Claimants base their claim for compensation upon the following:\n\na- That the Respondent violated its promise not to deprive SPP (ME) of its project rights.\n\nb- That the legal consequences of the violation by the Respondent of its obligations not to take measures of or amounting to nationalization or confiscation are that the Respondent is liable for the loss resulting from the violation of its promises and subsidiarily, that the Respondent is obliged to pay to SPP (ME) the compensation that it would have to pay at the time of the \"expropriation.\"\n\nc- That the proper measure of compensation, in the present case, is the full, fair value of the SPP (ME)\u2019s assets it had lost. The Claimants also explained that the indemnification include their rights as regards the Ras El Hekma project, hence upon the award of indemnification SPP (ME)\u2019s partner is to be considered released from any obligation as regards that project.\n\nII.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the measures it took do not fell within the scope of article 7 of Law No. 43, since the issuance of the Decree No. 90 of 1978 of the Minister of Culture declaring the lands on the Pyramids Plateau of public utility \"Antiquities,\" and the subsequent Presidential Decree repealing the Decree which allocated to EGOTH the use of the land on the Plateau for touristic purposes, did not purport to nationalize or confiscate the Claimants Project.\n\nIII.\n\nIn fact, after review of article (7) of Law No. 43 which reads as follows \"Project may not be nationalized or confiscated. The assets of such project cannot be seized, blocked, confiscated or sequestrated except by judicial procedures,\" this Tribunal stated in its first Preliminary Decision of November 27, 1985 that \"In this respect, it is quite clear that expropriation, the legitimacy of which is not being contested, if not accompanied by fair compensation, amounts to a confiscation which is prohibited by Law No. 43.\" That Decision reveals the Tribunal\u2019s conviction to the effect that beyond the technical legal *qualification juridique* of the act of the host State, expropriation for public utility should always be accompanied by compensation, otherwise it, in fact and in law, rejoins by its effect confiscation.\n\nIV.\n\nUnder Egyptian Law, private property is safeguarded by the provisions of the Constitution and the legislative provisions.\n\n- Article (34) of the Constitution states that \"Private ownership shall be safeguarded and may not be placed under sequestration except in the cases defined by law and in accordance with a judicial decision. It may not be expropriated except for the general good and against a fair compensation as defined by Law. The right of inheritance shall be guaranteed in it.\"\n\n- Article (805) of the Civil Code provides that \"Nul ne peut \u00eatre priv\u00e9 de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que dans le cas et de la mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9vue par la loi, et moyennant une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e9quitable,\" and article 985 of the said Code reads as follows: \"1. Le droit d\u2019usufruit peut \u00eatre acquis par acte juridique, par pr\u00e9emption ou par prescription.\" (Code civil, J.O. du 29 juillet 1948).\n\n- Law No. 577 of 1954 concerning expropriation for public utility, and its executive regulations issued by Decree No. 19398 of 1961, contain general rules considered *de droit commun,* as regards the procedures to be respected in case of expropriation for public utility which include the evaluation and the payment of compensation or *la mise \u00e0 disposition* of the amount of compensation to th\u00e9 proprietors and concerned parties.\n\nV.\n\nFrom the outset, in the present dispute, it is not alleged by the Respondent that it in fact proceeded vis-a-vis ETDC in compliance with the provisions of the above mentioned Law No. 557 of 1954 which requires *inter alia* the evaluation of the compensation by the administration itself, with the possibility accorded to the concerned parties to challenge this estimation before the Court. However, ETDC was recipient of the right of usufruct upon 4000 feddans from EGOTH by a registered act dated January 5, 1977 (Cls. exh: 109).\n\nAt least at the time of the issuance of the expropriatory act by Decree of the Minister of Culture No. 90 of 1978, the Administration did not challenge the legality of the act of registration. However, later, the legality of that act was challenged by the Respondent on the basis that the site subject to the registration was part of the public domain (Antiquities), and that under Egyptian Administrative Law, public domain cannot be alienated, and that in case the administration decides to accord individuals, the possibility of the use of part of that domain, the administration\u2019s act is qualified as a permit which necessarily is temporary and can be revoked whenever public interest calls for that. Moreover, the Respondent alleged that the registration of the right of usufruct to EGOTH, which later transmitted this right to ETDC, took place without reference to the necessary supporting maps which supposedly were attached to the Presidential Decree No. 475 of 1975, concerning the allocation of the right of usufruct to EGOTH for touristic use is vitiated and should be considered void. Nevertheless, it seems that the outcome of the present dispute does not necessitate a legal evaluation of the Respondent\u2019s arguments in this respect since the dispute receives sufficient legal answers upon the arguments and considerations explained below.\n\nVI.\n\nIf theoretically it is legally correct that the expropriation act was directed against ETDC, which would have had the quality and interest to be compensated, *the fact* that neither the Administration did respect the fundamental procedures in case of expropriation, nor did ETDC succeed in obtaining any compensation, neither in the framework of the rules governing expropriation nor *arguendo* those governing the case of an eventual annulation of an administrative permit fixing a certain duration for a beneficiary (it does not matter whether or not the Custodian had the quality and the capacity to act in this respect), mandates for the conclusion to the effect that the Claimants, as shareholders of ETDC, a joint venture presumably constituted in the framework of Law 43, are to be considered, in law, qualified to claim for compensation for the value of the eventual damage they suffered. This conclusion is confirmed by provisions of the Egyptian Law, in the first place, by the provisions of article 34 of the Constitution, since expropriation for public interest, unless accompanied by compensation as provided for in that article, constitutes a breach to the Constitution itself and therefore qualify any eventual concerned party to claim justice. (Court of Cassation, case 44 of the judicial year 35, of 27/3/69). In this vein, the arguments advanced by the Respondent to the effect that it offered compensation to the Claimants during the negotiations which took place starting from 1979, could not change the face of the fact that any eventual offer that would have been amicably presented, but yet not accepted, fell outside the framework of the provisions of Law No. 577 of 1954; moreover, there is no proof that any compensation was effectively paid neither to ETDC nor to the Claimants or had been *mise \u00e0 disposition* of ETDC as the law requires.\n\nVII.\n\nThe Claimants explained that their present claim for compensation covers altogether their share in the joint venture ETDC which was to implement two projects; one at the Pyramids and the other at Ras El Hekma, on the basis that the expropriation act and the subsequent events that occurred, rendered further cooperation impossible. In fact, although the object of the alleged act of\u2018expropriation\u2019 was the only site on the Pyramids Plateau, nevertheless it affected the whole structure and economy of ETDC, the joint venture, since EGOTH, the Egyptian partner was contributing in that Company only by the usufruct rights on the two sites. (4000 feddans for the Pyramids project and 1100 feddans for Ras El Hekma). For ETDC to continue with the participation of the Claimants it would have necessitated a new agreement to that effect.\n\nVIII.\n\nUnder Egyptian Law, the failure of the Administration to take the necessary procedures and measures for the evaluation of the compensation for expropriation as provided for by the provisions of Law No. 557 of 1954, results in that the judge is to be entrusted with this evaluation. (Court of Cassation, case 169 of the judicial year 47, 9/3/1978, and case 436 of the judicial year 49, 16/6/1982).\n\nIt seems noteworthy in this respect to point out that since the evaluation of compensation is to be effectuated by the Tribunal, the mechanism of article (226) of the Civil Code of Egypt, concerning moratory interests, in the case specified by that article, where the claim consists in a determined sum of money, running from the date of the claim before the Tribunal, this mechanism cannot come into play in the present dispute. The Egyptian Court of Cassation as far back as 1964 explained that under the provisions of article (226) which reads as follows: *\"Lorsque l\u2019objet de l\u2019obligation consiste en une somme d\u2019argent dont le montant est fix\u00e9 au moment de la demande en justice...*\" (Emphasis added), and since the judge has discretionary competence in the evaluation of the compensation in case of expropriation, any moratory interests could not be accorded but from the day of the judgment (Court of Cassation, Case 330 of the judicial year 29, 25/6/1964).\n\nIX.\n\nSince, in the present case, the claim consists in the evaluation of the value of the Claimants\u2019 share in the joint venture, which represents the alleged damage they suffered, the issue comes to the answer of the question of what was the real value of the Claimants share at the time, the alleged measure of expropriation was taken.\n\nA request for that the evaluation of compensation be based upon a claimant\u2019s \"out of pocket\" expenses seems, from the outset, in need of a legal ground.\n\nIn my opinion, to base the evaluation of compensation basically upon what the Claimants had incurred or allege to have incurred seems in need to receive legal and/or factual justification. It seems to me that there does not exist a necessary legal or factual correlation between the value of a share in a company and the eventual amount the shareholder spent or alleges to have spent. However, it is worth noting that the Majority Award stated that \"in a case such as the present one, where the measure of compensation is determined largely on the basis of the out of pocket expenses incurred by the Claimants...\" (The Majority Award, Para 207, p.81 [p. 386 of this issue]) and that \"there is no question that considerable amounts of time and money were spent on negotiating, planning, and implementing the project... In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, these amounts must be reimbursed as part of the fair compensation to which the Claimants are entitled.\" (The Majority Award, p. 77 [p. 384 of this issue]).\n\nX.\n\nA basic element for any eventual evaluation of compensation consists in the determination of the Claimants\u2019 legal situation under the Law. That is to say that before, and in order to effectuate any eventual evaluation of *a quantum* of compensation, it should first be properly established the *situation juridique* of the Claimants. To qualify for compensation, the concerned party should justify of rights, recognized under the Law and, hence, protected by it. Consequently and upon the findings in this respect, the quantum of compensation should necessarily be determined taking into consideration the *situation de fait* of the project.\n\nXI.\n\nAs regards the situation juridique and the situation de fait of the Claimants\u2019 project, a cursory review of the pertinent facts of the case indicates the following:\n\na- That the Claimants failed to produce justification, or supporting documents, for at least an amount of 1.5 million US$ included in their claim for reimbursement of Development costs. As it was explained above, the Procedural Order of February 13, 1991, was issued in the framework of the Tribunal\u2019s Competence to direct the burden of proof, as regards the critical issue concerning allegations of corruption.\n\nIn this context, and without going through more ample developments, it seems to me that the justifications advanced by the Claimants seem not to be a satisfactory response to that procedural order. By the clear language of that Procedural Order; the Claimants were not asked to justify their claim for reimbursement but rather, and in the first place, to refute allegations concerning illegal practices. The Claimants\u2019 explanation that they \"destroyed\" some supporting documents and some others were lost in 1979 due to the closure of their office in London, seems however to be contradicted by the fact that there does e?dst enough proof that these documents were evidently, necessarily and logically in existence at least up to January 1981 when the firm Coopers and Lybrand prepared their letter concerning the development costs without any mention or allusion to any missing document necessary for the preparation of their above mentioned letter. The existence of the above mentioned documents seems to be further corroborated by the Claimants\u2019 statements during the phase of negotiation as well as their testimonies before this Tribunal during the hearings held in Paris in September 1990, as already indicated. As a consequence, it seems inevitable that neither the Claimants could escape the consequences of their conduct in this respect, especially in view of all the facts that marked their relationship, nor could this Tribunal have the discretion to overlook the legal consequences thereupon, or retract the legal significance of its own Procedural Order of February 13, 1991.\n\nb- Moreover, and in all events, it is evident that the Claimants\u2019 *situation juridique* was precarious as well as their *situation de fait* was hazardous.\n\nb-1. As to their *situation juridique* under law 43, and without going through the arguments concerning the nature of the project and whether or not they were embarking in prohibited housing activities, the fact remains that they were under the obligation to conform with conditions and objectives set forth in their application to the GIA. Article (24) of the executive regulations to Law 43 provides for that \"Projects approved by the Authority *shall be implemented and conducted in accordance with the basic conditions and objectives set forth in their respective applications.* Any failure of a project to abide by the conditions and objectives of its approval shall be submitted to the Board of Directors.\" (Emphasis added). It had already been explained that the application for approval presented by the Claimants to the Board of Directors of the GIA contained information about the \"invested capital\" and the stages of implementation of the project. (Resp, annex F.17). The invested capital which meant to be \"imported in foreign currency,\" was of the amount of 22,5000,000.- US dollars for the first year plus loans to the amount of 16 million. Also the stages of implementation of the project were explained as giving first priority to the construction of a hotel. In view of the facts of the case, the Claimants seem to have failed to comply with their engagements. Noteworthy to point out that, the minutes of the Board of Directors of ETDC reveal the difficulty the Claimants encountered to arrange finance for a single hotel, it does not matter, legally speaking, whether or not they had the financial capability (as they advance as a result to the transactions they effectuated to Triad and later to two members of the Royal family of Saudi Arabia) since the fact remains that they were seeking that finance and obviously failed to arrange it as clearly indicated on the record by their representatives at the meetings of the Board of Directors of the joint venture under their management. Moreover, the Claimants seem, in any case, to have failed to comply with their engagement as regards the \"invested capital\" to be transferred to Egypt. In these circumstances, their *situation juridique* as \"investors\" in the framework of Law 43 was precarious. Not to mention, the serious allegations about their contravention to the Law 43 as well as other laws of the land, explained in detail in both reports of the Central Auditing Authority and the Experts\u2019 Committee. These facts altogether indicate, if not confirm, the precarious nature of the Claimants\u2019 *situation juridique.* It is noteworthy to point out that the review of the facts does not fail to indicate that not only the Claimants opted for the site on the Pyramids Plateau in close vicinity to the Monuments themselves, a site which seems to have been considered most appealing and much easier for marketing than the sites proposed by the Egyptian Government around and below the Plateau, as shown on the attached maps to the September Heads of Agreement, the only agreement, to be reminded, entered into by a duly authorized representative of the Egyptian Government, but they also were cognizant of the risks, inherent in their option, due to the nature of the site and the high probability of discovery of Antiquities as well as the unquestionable legal must of preservation of the Monuments in existence. Their acceptance of the risk and their readiness to comply with the eventual consequences related to their risky option, may be demonstrated *inter alia* by the agreement they entered into with \"representatives\" of the Antiquities Authority in September 1977 which contained clear obligations upon the Claimants, and especially their unconditional acceptance to leave any area on the site, in case the works reveal the existence of immovable Antiquities, as well as their solemn obligation to first inform the Antiquities Authority before undertaking any works. The apparent significance of that agreement as well as its inherent logic seem to be relevant as regards the risks the Claimants were cognizant of, as well as of the consequences thereupon, in the implementation of the project on the Plateau Proper. As a legal consequence to that acceptance of the risk I may refer to principles of Egyptian Law resulting from the provisions of articles 446 and 447 of the Civil Code. Article 446 reads as follows: \"1. Nonobstant toute clause de non-garantie, le vendeur demeure responsable de toute \u00e9viction provenant de son fait... 2. Il est \u00e9galement tenu, en cas d\u2019\u00e9viction provenant du fait d\u2019un tiers... \u00e0 moins de prouver que l\u2019acheteur connaissait, lors de la vente, la cause de l\u2019\u00e9viction, ou qu\u2019il avait achet\u00e9 *\u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils\"* (Emphasis added), Article 447 also provides in pertinent part for that \"... 2. *Toutefois, le vendeur ne r\u00e9pond pas des d\u00e9fauts dont l\u2019acheteur a eu connaissance au moment de la vente ou dont il aurait pu s'apercevoir lui-m\u00eame s\u2019il avait examin\u00e9 la chose comme l\u2019aurait fait une personne de diligence moyenne...*\" (Code Civil J. O. No. 108 du 29 juillet 1948, Emphasis added). Apart from the discoveries of Antiquities on the site, Respondent presented technical studies confirming the high danger that would have affected the Monuments themselves (the Pyramids) due, *inter alia,* to the effect of the water drainage problems (The study upon \"the Hydrological Study of the Area of Giza Pyramids Plateau,\" prepared by Consultant\n\nEngineer Dr. Aly Sabry which concluded that... \"3. There is nothing that can ensure against leakage of water in the archaeological zones of Antiquities specially in the beatification zone...,\" (Resp. Annex E23, p. 148, and annex F.32 concerning Engineering Hazards and Deleterious Effects of the Pyramids Oasis Project on the Existing Monuments, with special reference to p. 28, and the Cairo Pyramids Site: Anticipated Problems of the Site Construction from the Geological Point of View, Resp. Annex F.33, and also Ground Water and Seepage Conditions after the Erection of the Pyramids Oasis, Resp. Annex F.34). Needless to re-mention the proved encroachment by the Claimants in the implementation of their project upon the Monuments\u2019 zone itself.\n\nAll these facts should be taken into consideration in the appreciation of not only the legitimacy but also the necessity and urgness of the measures undertook both in respect to the rules of Egyptian law and the obligation to the safeguard of the monuments site under international rules of law, specifically those codified in the UNESCO Convention concerning the World Heritage Properties.\n\nIn this respect, it is noteworthy to refer to the contents of two letters from the General Director of the UNESCO, the first one dated April 6, 1981, in which he expresses that \"j\u2019ai tenu \u00e0 souligner par des d\u00e9clarations officielles que j\u2019ai faites en qualit\u00e9 de Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019UNESCO, que le plateau de Gizeh est un des hauts lieux d\u2019une des civilisations les plus brillantes de l\u2019Histoire. A ce titre, les Pyramides et tout le site qui les entoure constituent un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de ce patrimoine universel de monuments historiques dont la sauvegarde incombe \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 internationale... En prenant la d\u00e9cision de respecter pleinement l\u2019environnement des pyramides, les autorit\u00e9s \u00e9gyptiennes me semblent avoir pris une mesure conforme aux crit\u00e8res de pr\u00e9servation et de mise en valeur qui sont aujourd\u2019hui reconnues.\" (Resp. Annex, F.25). And the other letter, addressed to the Director of the newspaper Le Monde, the Director General of the UNESCO congratulated the above mentioned newspaper for its campaign against the Claimants\u2019 project on the Pyramids Plateau and pointed out that \"En soutenant l\u2019effort international visant \u00e0 sauvegarder et \u00e0 restaurer le patrimoine culturel de l\u2019humanit\u00e9 la presse et les autres grands moyens d\u2019information remplissent aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019opinion publique une mission capitale.\" (Resp. Annex F.28)\n\nb-2. As to the *de facto* situation of the Claimants, it seems evident that they stated on several occasions, during the time span of their activities in Egypt, before the Board of Directors of the joint venture that they encounter difficulties to arrange finance for the construction of a single hotel. Without going through the whole review of the conduct of the Claimants during their activities in Egypt, which was already mentioned in detail above, specifically by reference to the minutes of the Board of Directors of the joint venture, the Claimants clearly and unequivocally explained the *de facto* situation, in which they were, in their letter dated May 12, 1978 to the Prime Minister in which they expressed that \"... *the adverse worldwide publicity have now seriously impaired our effort to create the required credibility to attract the increasingly needed overseas finance for the project.\"* (Resp. Annex F.38, p. 2, Emphasis added)\n\nIt was already explained that the \"cause\" of the serious damage to the \"credibility\" of the Claimants, as explained in their letter, falls beyond the power and capacity of the Administration. To regain this credibility seems to require matters, and especially a certain image of the Claimants, that have nothing to do with the administration which, all the way, seems to have up till the end, taken the defense of the Claimants, at least in public, as already mentioned. In these circumstances, would it not be factually correct and hence legally founded to conclude that the Claimants were in fact in a situation of *impossibilit\u00e9 mat\u00e9rielle d\u2019ex\u00e9cution* of their project? Could they have been able to abide with their obligations specifically as regards \"the imported capital\" contained in their application to the Board of Directors of the GIA? These questions may best be answered in the light of what seems to be a fact that the Claimants were in sort of a \"financial vehicle,\" or \"intermediaries\" between eventual investors in the international market and the host State. The capital of SPP (ME) to be recalled amounts to about 200 US$ (two hundred), and their contribution in the capital of ETDC, up to the date of termination of the project, amounted to 1,310,000 US dollars, however the needed invested capital for the implementation of the project was estimated to be of 550,000,000 US dollars or even amounting to 770,000,000 US$ on the faith of the information contained in the Claimants letter to the President of May 19, 1975, in support of their request for the extension of the duration of the usufruct rights from 50 years to 99 years. The Claimants \"credibility\" seems to be the determinant factor to continue activities in the implementation of their titanic project.\n\nIn the light of these facts, it seems be hazardous, in any event, to take into consideration in the evaluation of an eventual *quantum* of compensation the loss of chance to make profits and/or to take into consideration the presumed \"revenues\" from the sales of usufruct rights, upon bare lots of land, which were part of the joint venture\u2019s capital. Had the proper legal qualification of the Claimants, under the law, been that they were urban developers, the consideration of the so-called sales revenues might have been justified.\n\nXII.\n\nIn my opinion, as a consequence to all of the above mentioned considerations, especially but not exclusively those related to the explanations to the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order of February 13,1991, and upon the provisions of article 216 of the Civil Code of Egypt which reads as follows: \"The judge may reduce the amount of damages, or he may rule that damages be not paid at all if the creditor, through his own mistake, took part in causing or increasing the damages,\" and upon the determination of the Claimants situation *de jure* and the review of their *de facto* situation, the claim for compensation should be rejected."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\nI. THE PROCEEDINGS\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn August 24, 1984, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"the Centre\" or \"ICSID\") received a Request for Arbitration from Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited (\"SPP(ME)\" or \"the Claimant\"), a Hong Kong corporation. The Request stated that SPP(ME) wished to institute arbitration proceedings under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the Washington Convention\") against the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"the ARE\" or \"the Respondent\"), and asked for the following relief:\n\n\"SPP(ME) respectfully requests ICSID to establish an arbitral tribunal to:\n\n1. determine that the ARE has undertaken obligations and incurred duties in respect to SPP(ME) both according to the terms of Law No. 43 and according to the Heads of Agreement of September 1974 specifically entered into by a Member of its Government, as well as by a Supplemental Agreement \"approved, agreed and ratified\" by the same Member of its Government.\n\n2. determine that the ARE violated its obligations thereunder,\n\n3. adopt and incorporate as its own the pertinent findings of fact made by the ICC Arbitral Tribunal concerning SPP(ME)\u2019s performance of its obligations under its agreements, the dismissal of EGOTH\u2019s counterclaim therein, and the acts bringing about termination of the investment project,\n\n4. determine the liability of the ARE to compensate SPP(ME) for the termination of its investment agreements and to award the full measure of indemnification to SPP(ME) on account of the destruction of its investment, increased by the additional costs, including all direct and indirect costs of the present proceedings, occasioned by ARE\u2019s wrongful refusal to honor the ICC award of February 16, 1983, or otherwise compensate SPP(ME), as well as interest at commercial rates.\"\n\n2.\n\nOn August 28, 1984, the Secretary-General of ICSID sent an acknowledgement of the Request to SPP(ME) and transmitted a copy of the Request to the Respondent. On the same day, the Secretary-General registered the Request in the Arbitration Register and notified the Parties accordingly.\n\n3.\n\nOn August 29, 1984, the Secretary-General notified the Parties by telex that:\n\n\"... the Arabic text of Article 8 of Law No. 43 of 1974 refers to the settlement of disputes within the framework of the ICSID Convention in the cases where it (i.e., the Convention) applies, and not, as erroneously mentioned in the English translation, where Law No. 90 of 1971 ratifying the Convention applies. I have, thus, registered the request of SPP without prejudice to the question whether said Article eight constitutes consent for the purposes of the ICSID Convention or merely includes a reference to this Convention in the cases where consent for ICSID jurisdiction is issued separately. This matter, if raised, will be for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide.\"\n\n4.\n\nOn August 29, 1984, the Centre received from SPP(ME) a proposal that a sole arbitrator be appointed pursuant to Rule 2(1)(a) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), or, alternatively, that the Parties jointly nominate an individual as President of the Tribunal.\n\n5.\n\nIn a communication received by the Centre on November 12, 1984, the Respondent stated that it contested the Centre\u2019s competence with respect to the present dispute, and that no action undertaken in proceedings concerning SPP(ME)\u2019s request could be deemed a renunciation of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. The Respondent rejected SPP(ME)\u2019s proposals for the constitution of the Tribunal and proposed as an alternative a Tribunal consisting of three members, with Dr. Eduardo JIMENEZ DE ARECHAGA serving as President of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 4 of the Centre\u2019s Arbitration Rules, the Parties agreed on November 26, 1984 to extend to December 3, 1984 the period for nominating their respective arbitrators and for agreement on the President of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn November 26, 1984, the Respondent designated Dr. Mohamed Amin EL MAHDI, an Egyptian national, as an arbitrator pursuant to Rule 3 of the Centre\u2019s Arbitration Rules. SPP(ME) informed the Centre on November 30, 1984 that it did not object to the nationality of the arbitrator named by the Respondent, as it might have done under Rule 3(1)(a)(i) of the Arbitration Rules, and that it was designating Mr. Robert E PIETROWSKI, Jr., a U.S. national, as an arbitrator. Further, SPP (ME) informed the Centre that it consented to the Respondent\u2019s proposal that Dr. JIMENEZ DE ARECHAGA be appointed President of the Tribunal. Dr. JIMENEZ DE ARECHAGA accepted his appointment on December 5, 1984 and Mr. PIETROWSKI accepted his appointment on December 7, 1984. On December 18, 1984, the Centre received notice that Dr. EL MAHDI accepted his appointment as an arbitrator, and the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Tribunal was constituted and that the proceedings were deemed to have begun in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n8.\n\nOn February 8, 1985, the Tribunal conducted a preliminary meeting with the Parties at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague. The Parties placed on record their agreement to the effect that:\n\n\"the Tribunal has been properly constituted in accordance with Section 2 of the ICSID Convention and Chapter 1 of the Arbitration Rules.\"\n\nIn accordance with Rule 20 of the Centre\u2019s Arbitration Rules, it was decided that the Arbitration Rules in effect up to September 26, 1984 would apply; that the procedural languages would be English and French; and that the seat of the arbitration would be Washington.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal decided at the preliminary meeting to suspend the proceedings on the merits pending a decision on the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections, and that the proceedings on jurisdiction would consist of written pleadings and oral argument. The Tribunal then fixed a schedule for the filing of the written pleadings on jurisdiction, with the Respondent\u2019s observations to be filed by May 8,1985 and the Claimant\u2019s observations to be filed by June 19, 1985.\n\n10.\n\nThe observations of both Parties were filed within the prescribed time limits. The Respondent in its observations submitted that the Tribunal should\n\n\"pour l\u2019ensemble des motifs ci-dessus expos\u00e9s, se dire incomp\u00e9tent pour conna\u00eetre des demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par SPP(ME).\u2019\u2019\n\nThe observations of the Claimant submitted that the Tribunal should\n\n\"reject Respondent\u2019s objections to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction over this dispute between SPP(ME) and the Government of Egypt regarding the State\u2019s failure to compensate this foreign investor for the losses it suffered as a result of the State\u2019s cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis project.\"\n\n11.\n\nOn July 8,1985, the Centre received from the Respondent a further pleading addressing certain arguments made by the Claimant in its observations.\n\n12.\n\nOral argument on the question of jurisdiction was held at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague on July 10 and 11, 1985. The hearings were recorded in the form of a verbatim transcript in the English and French languages. At the end of the oral proceedings, the Tribunal requested that the Parties submit certain additional materials concerning Egypt\u2019s Law No. 43 of 1974 concerning the Investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the Free Zones.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 23, 1985, the Parties advised the Centre that Southern Pacific Properties Limited (\"SPP\"), the parent company of SPP(ME) and also a Hong Kong corporation, had been joined as a claimant in the proceedings subject to the Respondent\u2019s reservation of jurisdictional defenses.\n\n14.\n\nIn response to the request made by the Tribunal at the end of the oral proceedings, SPP and SPP(ME) (\"the Claimants\") and the Respondent filed supplemental materials concerning Law No. 43 on August 21 and August 27, 1985, respectively.\n\n15.\n\nOn November 27, 1985, the Tribunal rendered a Decision on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction. In this decision, the Tribunal unanimously rejected certain of the Respondent\u2019s objections concerning jurisdiction and stayed the proceedings on the Respondent\u2019s remaining jurisdictional objections pending final disposition by the French courts of certain concurrent proceedings involving the same dispute. The operative part of the Tribunal\u2019s decision provided:\n\n\"THE TRIBUNAL UNANIMOUSLY DECIDES:\n\nA. To reject the objections to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent alleging that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, as well as the pursuit by the Claimants of alternative remedies, bar the claim in the present case;\n\nB. To reject the objection to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent alleging the withdrawal from the Claimant of the benefits of Law No. 43;\n\nC. To reject the objection to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent contending that the provisions of Article 8 of Law No. 43 do not apply to this investment dispute; and\n\nD. To stay the present proceedings on the Respondent\u2019s remaining objections to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction until the proceedings in the French courts have finally resolved the question of whether the Parties agreed to submit their dispute to the jurisdiction of the International Chamber of Commerce.\"\n\n16.\n\nOn January 6, 1987, the French *Cour de Cassation* issued a decision the effect of which was to finally determine that the Respondent had not agreed to submit the present dispute to arbitration under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\").\n\n17.\n\nOn January 29, 1987, the Claimants filed a request with the Tribunal asking that the present proceedings be resumed in view of the *Cour de Cassation\u2019s* decision of January 6, 1987.\n\n18.\n\nOn March 24, 1987, at the request of the Respondent, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file further written pleadings and supporting materials.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent filed its *M\u00e9moire,* dated April 30, 1987, and requested further hearings on the remaining jurisdictional issues. The Claimants then filed their \"Observations on Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Memorandum,\" dated May 20, 1987.\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal met in London on May 25-27, 1987. After reviewing the new materials filed by the Parties, and in consideration of its Decision on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction of November 27, 1985 and the decision of the French *Cour de Cassation* of January 6, 1987, the Tribunal unanimously decided to accede to the Respondent\u2019s request for further hearings on the question of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n21.\n\nThe final hearings on the question of jurisdiction were held in Paris on September 8, 1987. At the conclusion of the hearings, the Tribunal instructed the Parties to present their final written submissions on the jurisdictional issues, together with an enumeration of the specific arguments relied on to support those submissions, by September 25, 1987.\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 \"Final Submission on Jurisdiction\" dated September 25, 1987 submitted that the Tribunal should\n\n\"determine in favor of Claimants the remaining jurisdictional issue, to rule that the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"A.R.E.\") has consented to ICSID arbitration in conformity with the requirement of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and to take jurisdiction over the investment dispute between the parties.\"\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s *M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9plique* dated September 25, 1987 did not contain formal submissions as such, but reiterated certain points made by the Respondent\u2019s counsel at the hearing held in Paris on September 8, 1987, and responded to arguments made by counsel for the Claimants at that hearing.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal conducted its final deliberations on the question of Jurisdiction in Washington on December 7\u201412, 1987. On April 14, 1988, a majority Decision on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction was signed. The operative part of the Tribunal\u2019s decision provided:\n\n*\"THE TRIBUNAL DECIDES:*\n\n(A) To reject the objection to its jurisdiction raised by the Respondent alleging that Article 8 of Law No. 43 does not suffice to establish Egypt\u2019s consent to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction;\n\n(B) To reject the submission of the Claimants that the Tribunal adopt and incorporate as its own the pertinent findings of fact made by the ICC tribunal; and\n\n(C) Consequently, and in accordance with Rules 25 and 41, to instruct the President to fix the time Emits for further proceedings on the merits in consultation with the Parties.\"\n\n25.\n\nOn October 5, 1988, the Tribunal fixed December 5, 1988 as the date for the filing of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the merits. On November 17, 1988, this time limit was extended to January 5, 1989 and on January 4, 1989 it was further extended to February 15, 1989. At the same time, the Tribunal fixed June 25, 1989 as the time Emit for the fifing of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial. The Centre received the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on February 16, 1989.\n\n26.\n\nMeanwhile, on November 14, 1988, the Centre received from the Respondent an application for annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction of April 14, 1988. In a letter dated December 9, 1988, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Respondent of his decision not to register the application for annulment on the ground that the Tribunal's decision of April 14, 1988 was not an \"award\" as that term is used in Article 52 of the Washington Convention and Rule 50 of the Centre\u2019s Arbitration Rules.\n\n27.\n\nThe time limit for filing the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial was extended on May 16, 1989 to September 7, 1989, and again on August 31, 1989 to September 15,1989. The Centre received the Respondent\u2019s CounterMemorial on September 18, 1989.\n\n28.\n\nOn October 12, 1989, the Tribunal fixed a schedule for the fifing of the remainder of the written pleadings, with the Claimants\u2019 Reply to be filed by December 5, 1989 and the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder to be filed by February 20, 1990. The Centre received the Claimants\u2019 Reply on December 28, 1989 and the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Reply on February 22, 1990.\n\n29.\n\nOn March 14, 1990, the President of the Tribunal held a consultation with representatives of the Parties in order to agree on the date and place for the final hearings on the merits. It was agreed to hold the final hearings in Paris.\n\n30.\n\nOn April 16, 1990, the President of the Tribunal issued a procedural order fixing September 3-11, 1990 as the dates for the hearings on the merits in Paris and providing further directions to the Parties including, *inter alia,* directions that they file written summaries of the relief claimed after the hearings. Following agreement by the Parties on certain procedures for the oral proceedings, the Tribunal, on August 23, 1990, issued a procedural order in respect of the conduct of the hearings.\n\n31.\n\nThe final hearings on the merits were held in Paris during the period September 3-11, 1990. The Tribunal heard testimony by witnesses and experts, as well as oral argument. The witnesses and experts appearing on behalf of the Claimants were: Mr. Ralph M. Grierson, Mr. Gerald Walker, Mr. Norbert Stibrany, Mr. William D. Birchall, Mr. A. Anthony McLellan, Mr. Ronald Blainey and Mr. David H. Gilmour. The witnesses and experts appearing on behalf of the Respondent were Professor Rainer Statdelmann, Mr. Michael Renshall, Ms. Soheir Azab and Professor Abdel Moneim Awadallah. In addition, the Respondent submitted an affidavit by Mr. Arif M. El-Azab.\n\n32.\n\nAt the close of the hearings, the Tribunal\u2014in response to a request by the Respondent\u2014ruled that the Respondent could submit written comments on the exhibits that had been produced for the first time during the hearings by the Claimants\u2019 witnesses and experts. The Tribunal asked that these comments be submitted by October 31, 1990.\n\n33.\n\nOn September 21, 1990, the Claimants, pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s procedural order of April 16, 1990, submitted a document entitled \"Final Conclusions and Prayer for Relief\u2019 which summarized the relief sought by the Claimants as follows:\n\n\"The Claim\n\nA. The Claimants claim primarily:\n\n(1) the value of the investment in ETDC computed at $41,000,000, or such other sum as the Tribunal may award, on the basis of (i) the DCF methodology and/or (ii) the share sales to the Saudi Princes; and\n\n(2) the amount of the loan to ETDC, amounting to $1,650,000; and\n\n(3) post-cancellation costs for 1978 and 1979, amounting to $623,000; and\n\n(4) post-cancellation, legal, audit and arbitration costs from 1980 to 1990, amounting to $5,108,000;\n\ntogether with interest:\n\na. on the value of the investment ((1) herein) at 12.6% compounded annually, amounting (on a value of $41,000,000) to $125,000,000; and\n\nb. on (3) herein at 12.6% compounded annually, amounting to $1,874,000; and\n\nc. on the loan to ETDC ((2) herein) at the contractual rate, amounting to $6,931,000.\n\nB. The Claimants claim secondarily, as an alternative to A above, the value of its investment in ETDC on the basis of its out-of-pocket expenses (items 1-6), on the view that the project would necessarily have realized, at the very least, the amount invested in it, and an additional amount (item 7) to compensate for loss of the chance or opportunity of making a commercial success of the project:\n\n(1) the amount of the loan to ETDC, amounting to $1,650,000; and\n\n(2) further monies lent at no interest to ETDC, amounting to $408,000; and\n\n(3) the capital invested, amounting to $1,310,000; and\n\n(4) development costs pre-cancellation, amounting to $2,254,000; and\n\n(5) post-cancellation costs for 1978 and 1979, amounting to $623,000; and\n\n(6) post-cancellation, legal, audit and arbitration costs from 1980 to 1990, amounting to $5,108,000; and\n\n(7) such additional amount as shall be fixed by the Tribunal to compensate for the loss of the chance or opportunity of making a commercial success of the project;\n\ntogether with interest:\n\na. on the loan to ETDC ((1) herein) at the contractual rate, amounting to $6,931,000; and\n\nb. on (3) herein at 12.6%, compounded annually, amounting to $4,303,000; and\n\nc. on (4) herein at 12.6%, compounded annually, amounting to $7,404,000; and\n\nd. on (5) herein at 12.6%, compounded annually, amounting to $1,874,000.\n\nC. The Claimants claim as a further, subsidiary alternative to A and B above the out-of-pocket expenses represented by items B (1)-(6) above, together with interest as set forth in items B a-d above.\n\nInterest on all items has been calculated to 31 August 1990. The Claimants ask that further interest be added to take the computation to the date of award.\n\nPost-Award Interest\n\nThe Claimants claim post-award interest at a commercial rate on the final sums awarded, commencing 30 days after the date of the award and running until the date of payment.\n\nThe Object of the Award\n\nClaimants claim that any and all amounts recognized by the Tribunal under claims A, B and C above should be awarded:\n\n(i) to SPP (Middle East) Limited and Southern Pacific Properties Limited, jointly; and\n\n(ii) to the extent that the prayer in part (i) herein is not recognized, then to SPP (Middle East) Limited alone; and\n\n(iii) to the extent that the prayers in parts (i) and (ii) herein are not recognized, then to Southern Pacific Properties Limited alone.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counterclaim\n\nRespondent\u2019s counterclaim and the relief sought by it should be denied in all respects.\"\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent filed a summary of the relief claimed on September 25, 1990, requesting that the Tribunal decide the case as follows:\n\n\"SOUS la r\u00e9serve expresse de la question de la comp\u00e9tence juridictionnelle (ID2) (1)(1), la R.A.E. demande au Tribunal arbitral qu\u2019il lui plaise dire et juger:\n\n(1) On d\u00e9signe ci-apr\u00e8s:\n\n- le M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9ponse de la R.A.E.du 15/9/1989,\n\nFacts: *I F* ;

II D) ;\n\n3) Il fut offert notamment lors des n\u00e9gociations de 1979 un terrain de remplacement proche des sites initiaux permettant la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un projet analogue \u00e0 celui qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu en particulier dans le Heads of Agreement et le contrat du 12 d\u00e9cembre 1974, offre qui fut refus\u00e9e sans examen s\u00e9rieux (pi\u00e8ces F 37, F 43, F 51) (Il F 111 et s. ; I D 150 et s. ; II D 87 et s.).\n\nQue si, par extraordinaire, un doute subsistait, le Tribunal ordonnerait soit un transport sur le site, soit une expertise aux fins de v\u00e9rifier la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un projet touristique sur ledit site de remplacement (I D 150).\n\n4) La R.A.E. a \u00e9galement offert, au m\u00eame moment, un d\u00e9dommagement mon\u00e9taire pour compenser les cons\u00e9quences du changement de site (II D 91 et s.).\n\n5) SPP (ME) n\u2019a pas n\u00e9goci\u00e9 de bonne foi, tant au regard du site de remplacement qu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tudier s\u00e9rieusement, qu\u2019au regard de la compensation mon\u00e9taire, alors qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9sentait des demandes totalement d\u00e9pourvues de justification, notamment quant aux \"development costs\" susmentionn\u00e9s (I D 116 et s. ;

III D 119 et s.).\n\nb) Que parmi ces circonstances particuli\u00e8res figure au premier plan le fait -non contest\u00e9- que la R.A.E. ne s\u2019est pas enrichie, et m\u00eame s\u2019est appauvrie sans autre raison que de prot\u00e9ger le patrimoine culturel mondial et de respecter une obligation internationale.\n\nc) Qu\u2019en tout \u00e9tat de cause, le lucrum cessans est exclu, en raison du caract\u00e8re licite, et m\u00eame obligatoire, des mesures (I D 73 et s. et 146 et s. ;

These comments, together with certain additional documents, were received by the Centre on December 3, 1990.\n\n36.\n\nOn December 21, 1990, the Claimants responded to certain points made by the Respondent in its submission of December 3, 1990.\n\n37.\n\nOn February 11 to 13, 1991, the Tribunal met in London and on February 13 it issued a procedural order requesting further information from the Parties as follows:\n\n\"1. Whereas, the Claimants have explained that they have incurred certain expenses in connection with what they describe as the planning, developing, financing and management of the project, adding that said expenses have been capitalized as development costs in the accounts of SPP(ME) before and after the measures taken in May 1978 by the Respondent.\n\n2. Whereas, the Claimants have submitted as Exhibit 170 a letter dated 19 January 1981 from Coopers & Lybrand, with a summary of SPP(ME)\u2019s development costs for the years 1975-1979, broken down by categories of expense.\n\n3. Whereas, the above-referenced letter dated 19 January 1981 from Coopers & Lybrand states that the summary of development costs for each year from 1975 to 1979 \"agrees in total by year to the audited accounts of SPP (Middle East) Limited, and is in accordance with the information contained in our audit files, which do not, however, provide a detailed analysis for each period shown in the summary.\" The letter further describes the audit procedures followed, indicating that a detailed analysis of these costs, prepared by employees of the company with reference to the various categories of expense, was provided to Coopers & Lybrand each year and \"agreed by us to the expense accounts in the company\u2019s nominal ledger, in which all expenditure was recorded in the first instance.\" The letter adds that \"[t]hose items which were material in relation to the total of these costs in each year were verified by us in order to ensure that the expenditure as recorded in the nominal ledger had been recorded correctly and had been authorised properly.\" This verification was carried out \"by agreeing the selected items to the documentation supporting the expenditure, such as invoices and loan agreements and by performing tests on procedures operated by the company to ensure all payments were properly authorised\" and by reviewing \"minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors.\"\n\n4. Whereas, for its part the Respondent has stated in its Annex F-49 that the investigation of these expenses \"sheds doubt over the components of the unjustifiable developing costs which were not charged to ETDC. This investigation requires the appropriate and clear details with their supporting legal documents in relation to the nature and components of these costs.\" In this connection, the Respondent formally requested that the Tribunal order \"une expertise pour v\u00e9rifier la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de ces co\u00fbts et les destinataires r\u00e9els des paiements intervenus.\"\n\n5. Whereas, the Respondent has submitted as Annex F-72 a report by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. dated 14 August 1981, which states that \"[i]t is not possible... to be satisfied that the costs incurred either up to 18 June 1978, or subsequently, relate to the Pyramids Project\" and that \"we do not understand why [these costs] were not directly recovered from ETDC.\"\n\n6. Whereas, the Tribunal did not receive sufficiently clear and precise information and figures concerning the development costs, nor the necessary indications as to the nature and supporting documents of the expenditures involved, to be in a position to determine all of the related legal consequences.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal decides the following:\n\na. The Claimants shall submit to the Tribunal and to the Respondent, within one month, a document indicating the nature, date and amount of the above-referenced development costs, including the names of the recipients of payments in excess of U.S. $20,000 and a confirmation that these sums were legitimately and actually expended for the project and were directly connected with it. The document shall also contain an explanation of why these costs were not charged to or were not directly recovered from ETDC.\n\nb. The Parties, within one month, shall submit to the Tribunal and to each other an itemized list of the legal and accounting fees relating to the present proceedings, indicating their amount, the respective dates and the phase of the proceedings to which those fees and expenses relate.\n\nc. After receipt of the documents referred to in paragraphs a and b above, the Parties shall have one month within which to submit their comments thereon to the Tribunal.\"\n\n38.\n\nOn March 15, 1991, the time limit for the Claimants\u2019 submission of the information requested by the Tribunal in its procedural order of February 13, 1991 was extended to April 21, 1991. On March 25, 1991, the time limit for the Respondent\u2019s submission of the information requested in Paragraph 6(b) of the procedural order was extended to April 21, 1991, and the time limit for its submission of the information requested in Paragraph 6(c) was extended to June 21, 1991.\n\n39.\n\nOn April 22, 1991, the Centre received the Respondent\u2019s response to Paragraph 6(b) of the procedural order and on April 23, 1991 the Centre received the Claimants\u2019 response to Paragraphs 6(a) and (b). The Centre received the Respondent\u2019s comments on the Claimants\u2019 response to the procedural order on June 26, 1991.\n\n40.\n\nOn July 9, 1991, the Claimants filed a response to the Respondent\u2019s comments of June 26, 1991, and on September 18, 1991, the Respondent filed a response to the Claimants\u2019 response. Although this final exchange of communications had not been requested by the Tribunal, the materials submitted by the Parties were nevertheless considered by the Tribunal.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal convened its final deliberation on the merits in Paris on February 17,1992. On February 18, 1992, the Tribunal issued a procedural order declaring the proceedings closed.\n\nII. THE FACTS\n-------------\n\n42.\n\nOn September 23, 1974, a contract entitled \"Heads of Agreement\" was entered into by the Respondent (represented by the Minister of Tourism), the Egyptian General Organization for Tourism and Hotels (\"EGOTH\") and SPP, a company engaged in the development of tourist and resort facilities. EGOTH was at the time a public sector enterprise under the control of the Minister of Tourism, organized under Egyptian Law No. 60 of 1971.\n\n43.\n\nThe Heads of Agreement by its terms was entered into in accordance with certain Egyptian laws, including Law No. 43 of 1974 Concerning the Investment of Arab and Foreign Funds and the Free Zones. In the Heads of Agreement, EGOTH and SPP undertook to incorporate an Egyptian joint venture company to develop tourist complexes at the Pyramids area near Cairo and at Ras El Hekma on the Mediterranean coast. These projects were to be developed according to detailed \"master plans\" which were to be prepared by SPP and approved by EGOTH. The Ministry of Tourism agreed to secure the title to property and the possession of land necessary for the development of the proposed projects. The Ministry and EGOTH undertook to transfer the right of usufruct for such property to the joint venture company as part of the capital investment. They also undertook to assist in obtaining all necessary local approval for the execution of the projects in accordance with the master plans. SPP, for its part, agreed to obtain the necessary financing for the projects and to provide or arrange for all technical expertise required for the design, construction, management and marketing of the projects.\n\n44.\n\nThe Preamble of the Heads of Agreement, which was expressly made part of the Agreement by Article 1, provided:\n\n\"Whereas the Ministry of Tourism approved granting both 2nd and 3rd party [i.e., EGOTH and SPP] the right to develop the areas as shown in the attached maps in the Pyramid\u2019s area and Ras El Hekma Zone.\n\nThis agreement is issued in accordance with laws No. 1 for the year 1973 relating to Hotels, Instaurions and Tourism, and law No. 2 for the year 1973 relating to the supervision by the Ministry of Tourism on touristic sites and the development of such areas, and law 43 for the year 1974 relating to Arab and foreign fonds invested in the A.R.E. with particular reference to government guarantees long term tax holidays, exemptions from import custom duties, etc.\"\n\n45.\n\nArticle 2 of the Heads of Agreement provided:\n\n\"Both 2nd and 3rd parties undertake to incorporate promptly an Egyptian joint venture company of which 40 percent would be subscribed by E.G.O.T.H. and 60 percent by S.P.P. (For the Pyramid area) and 30 percent by E.G.O.T.H. and 70 percent by S.P.P (For Ras El Hekma).\"\n\nand Article 4 provided:\n\n\"FIRST party will secure the title of property and possession of land and both First and second party undertake to transfer the right of usufruct to the joint company as its part of the capital investment. Both M.T. [i.e., Ministry of Tourism] and E.G.O.T.H. undertake to transfer such right to the joint company immediately upon incorporation, any balance being transferred not later than 90 days thereafter.\"\n\n46.\n\nOn December 12, 1974, a contract entitled \"Agreement for the Development of Two International Tourist Projects in Egypt\" (\"the December Agreement\") was concluded between EGOTH and SPP. The Preamble of the December Agreement referred to the Heads of Agreement, saying that:\n\n\"Following execution of the Heads of Agreement dated 23rd September, 1974,... and subsequent negotiations between the above parties, the following are agreed....\"\n\nArticle 1 of the December Agreement provided for the formation of a joint venture company\u2014the Egyptian Tourist Development Company (\"ETDC\") \u2014to develop tourist complexes at the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma sites:\n\n\"A joint venture (stock) company with registered shares will be incorporated in Egypt for a duration of fifty years renewable, named the \"Egyptian Tourist Development Company\" (hereinafter referred to as \"ETDC\") which shall be responsible for the development and operation of the projects. The nominal capital shall be US$2,000,000 (two million United States dollars) increasing to US$10,000,000 (ten million United States dollars) at the end of the fifth year. The capital shall be subscribed 60 (sixty) per cent by SPP and 40 (forty) per cent by EGOTH. On the fiftieth anniversary of the incorporation of ETDC, EGOTH shall be entitled to an additional share at no cost in the capital of ETDC as will increase the EGOTH shareholding to 50 (fifty) per cent of the total capital of the company. The participation of EGOTH in the capital of ETDC shall be represented by the rights of usufruct referred to in Articles 5 and 6 hereinafter. These rights are hereby agreed to be equal to the share of EGOTH in the capital of ETDC namely 40 (forty) per cent at the incorporation of ETDC and through its duration and 50 (fifty) per cent beginning at the fiftieth anniversary of its incorporation.\"\n\n47.\n\nSPP agreed in Article 3 of the December Agreement to arrange for the financing of the projects:\n\n\"SPP will be responsible for the arranging of US$20,000,000 (twenty million United States dollars) finance on terms and conditions prevailing on the international market to be invested in the projects in the first four years from the date of approval of the Master Plans as referred to in Article 4 hereinafter, and will ensure over and above that all necessary additional finance required for both projects shall be provided by means of short and long term capital, both in free and local currency.\"\n\n48.\n\nArticle 4 provided that the development and management of the projects would be undertaken by ETDC\n\n\"within the general limits described in the maps attached to the Heads of Agreement, and in general accord with the Confidential Report, and as detailed in the Master Plans to be prepared. Each Master Plan shall recognise the appropriate regional plan and shall specify the various zones for the different types of development and shall include the location and description as well as the stages and priorities of all tourist facilities.... For the Pyramids area there will be defined within the Master Plan area, the project site area of not less than 10,000 (ten thousand) feddans (approximately 10,000 acres) to which EGOTH will receive title and ETDC the right of usufruct as provided in Articles 5 and 6 hereinafter and within which 5,000 (five thousand) feddans (approximately 5,000 acres) will be developed. The remainder will be parkland and other recreational facilities available for public use within the Master Plan.\"\n\n49.\n\nWith respect to the rights of usufruct that were to represent EGOTH\u2019s capital contribution to the joint venture, Article 5 of the December Agreement stipulated that EGOTH would\n\n\"use its best efforts to secure all the necessary Government approvals to enable ETDC the immediate possession of the land in both sites, and to ensure the transfer of the rights of usufruct to ETDC for its duration....\"\n\nand Article 6 provided:\n\n\"EGOTH will pass irrevocably the right of usufruct to ETDC for its duration immediately EGOTH receives title. ETDC shall be free to assign its right of usufruct and to rent, lease, manage, promote or assign any site, construction, recreational, residential or commercial facilities in both local and foreign markets, provided that they are developed and utilized in accordance with approved plans, but excluding the monument areas and those which are designated for public use within the project sites.\"\n\n50.\n\nThe December Agreement also provided in Article 17 that SPP would incorporate a holding company to own its shareholding in the joint venture:\n\n\"It is understood that SPP will be incorporating a holding company to own its shareholding in ETDC and it is agreed that SPP shall have the right to assign its rights, privileges, duties and obligations under this Agreement to this company in which SPP will have a controlling, but not necessarily majority, interest and in which it controls and directs management, provided the company satisfies EGOTH.\"\n\nSuch an assignment was subsequently made to SPP(ME), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPP formed in 1974 to undertake the execution of the projects at the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma sites.\n\n51.\n\nArticle 20 of the December Agreement provided that any dispute relating to that agreement would be submitted to ICC arbitration, and Article 21 stated that the December Agreement had been made in accordance with various laws of the ARE, including Law No. 43 of 1974.\n\n52.\n\nOn the final page of the December Agreement, following the signatures of the representatives of EGOTH and SPP, there appeared the typewritten statement, \"Approved, agreed and ratified by the Minister of Tourism, His Excellency, Mr. Ibrahim Naguib, on the Twelfth day of December 1974.\" Next to this statement the signature of the Minister and an official stamp were affixed.\n\n53.\n\nOn the same date that the December Agreement was signed, the representatives of EGOTH and SPP also signed a \"statement\" which provided:\n\n\"It is understood between contracting parties (EGOTH) and (S.P.P.) in concern of the agreement signed on the 12th of December 1974, that obligations which lie on EGOTH are subject to the approval of the competent governmental authorities and that the feasibility study proves the profitability of the projects.\"\n\n54.\n\nBy a letter dated April 12, 1975, the General Organization for Investment of Arab Capital and Tax-Free Areas (\"the GIA\") notified SPP that the GIA\u2019s Board of Directors, by Decree No. 30/16-75, had approved the application for the establishment of a joint venture between EGOTH and SPP for the development of the tourist areas at the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma sites. The approval provided that the beneficial rights would accrue to the joint venture for a period of 50 years and then would revert to the State. This period was subsequently extended by the GIA to 99 years.\n\n55.\n\nOn May 22, 1975, the President of Egypt issued Decree No. 475 of 1975 which provided:\n\n\"The lands lying on each of the plateau of the pyramids and Ras-El-Hekma and whose features and dimensions are determined on the map and in the attached memorandum are assigned for the touristic utilization and the General Egyptian establishment for Tourism and Hotels itself or through one of its contributing companies will reconstruct and utilize these two areas.\"\n\n56.\n\nOn October 19, 1975, EGOTH as sole owner of the sites specified in Presidential Decree No. 475 transferred its right of usufruct for the sites \"irrevocably\" and \"without restriction of any kind\" to ETDC for the life of the joint venture.\n\n57.\n\nOn November 23, 1975, EGOTH and SPP(ME) signed a contract entitled \"Preliminary Agreement of Incorporation\" which provided for the incorporation of ETDC in conformity with Law No. 1 of 1973 Concerning Tourist Establishments and Law No. 43 of 1974. The incorporation of ETDC was subsequently authorized by Ministerial Decree No. 212 of 1975, issued by the Ministry of Economy and Economic Cooperation on December 4, 1975. This decree stated in its preamble that it was issued in conformity with inter alia\"the [GIA] Board of Directors\u2019 Resolution No. 50/15/1975 at the session of 20th July, 1975; and the memorandum of the Deputy Chairman of the General Authority for Arab Investment dated 1st December, 1975.\"\n\n58.\n\nBy a letter dated April 1, 1976, the Chairman of EGOTH notified the Chairman of ETDC of the \"formal approval of the MT [Ministry of Tourism] and EGOTH of the Pyramids Oasis Project as a whole....\"\n\n59.\n\nOn October 19, 1976, the Minister of Tourism wrote to the Chairman of ETDC, stating:\n\n\"I am writing to confirm my formal approval of the development and construction of your project pursuant to all terms of Law No. 2 of 1973.\n\nThis approval entitles you to proceed with your programme without the necessity of further reference to this Ministry.\"\n\n60.\n\nOn June 1, 1977, the Ministry of Tourism issued Decree No. 96 of 1977. Article 1 of this decree provided:\n\n\"The Ministry of Tourism approves the master planning for the tourist Pyramids Plateau Area, as well as the detailed planning of the first phase regarding the implementation of villages nos 1, 3 and 21 of the project of exploiting the tourist Giza Pyramids Plateau....\"\n\n61.\n\nConstruction began at the Pyramids site in July of 1977. Roads were laid, water and sewage trunk mains were installed, excavation for artificial lakes and a golf course was undertaken, and work on the main water reservoir was nearly completed. Planning was completed for the Pyramids Oasis George V Hotel, as were the designs for a second hotel. In addition, ETDC sold 386 lots on which villas and multi-family accommodations were to be built, for a total of US $10,211,000.\n\n62.\n\nIn late 1977, the Pyramids Oasis Project began to encounter political opposition in Egypt and it became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. Opponents of the project claimed that it posed a threat to undiscovered antiquities.\n\n63.\n\nIn a decree issued on May 27,1978, the Ministry of Information and Culture declared the land surrounding the Pyramids to be \"public property (Antiquity).\" This decree was issued upon the recommendation of the Egyptian Antiquities Authority, which confirmed the presence of antiquities in the western part of the A1 Giza Pyramids region.\n\n64.\n\nOn May 28, 1978, the GIA withdrew its approval of the Pyramids Oasis Project by Resolution No. 1/51-78:\n\n\"As a result of the Decree of the Minister of Culture and Information dated 28/5/78, considering the Pyramids Plateau one of the monumental areas, and accordingly the nature of the land had changed to be a public domain owned by the State as public property, it is impossible legally to implement this project on this land.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the General Investment Authority decided to drop its former issued agreement No 50/19-75, dated 20th July 1975, concerning the Pyramids Plateau, for the impossibility of executing this project on the Plateau, thus, according to the decree of the Minister of Culture and Information.\"\n\n65.\n\nOn June 19, 1978, Presidential Decree No. 267 was issued, cancelling Presidential Decree No. 475, which had declared that the lands on the Pyramids Plateau would be used for \"tourist utilization.\" On July 11, 1978, the Prime Minister issued a decree declaring these same lands *d\u2019utilit\u00e9 publique.*\n\n66.\n\nAt the request of EGOTH, ETDC was put under judicial trusteeship by a judgment of the Giza Court for Urgent Matters rendered on June 19, 1978. The court appointed trustees who were put in charge of the management of the company\u2019s assets until a general meeting of the shareholders could take place.\n\n67.\n\nOn December 7, 1978, SPP and SPP(ME) filed a request for arbitration with the ICC in Paris against the Respondent and EGOTH under the arbitration clause in the December Agreement. The Respondent objected to the jurisdiction of the ICC tribunal. In the *acte de mission,* the Respondent and EGOTH stated:\n\n\"The FIRST and SECOND DEFENDANTS wish to make it clear that their submission of an ANSWER and COUNTER-CLAIM does not constitute in any way an acceptance of the initiation of this arbitration proceedings. Their refusal of the arbitration proceedings is to remain firm until the Arbitrators render their final decision on the matter of jurisdiction. In case the Arbitrators affirm their jurisdiction over the subject matter at issue, the COUNTER-CLAIM shall be comprised within the said jurisdiction.\"\n\n68.\n\nThe ICC tribunal, in an award rendered on February 16, 1983, held *inter alia:*\n\n\"1. That the first Defendant, the Arab Republic of Egypt, pay to the First Claimant, Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East), Limited the sum of US$12,500,000 (twelve million five hundred thousand) together with interest thereof at the rate of 5% per annum from the date in which the request for arbitration was received by the Secretary of the ICC Court of Arbitration (i.e. 1st December 1978) until payment.\n\n2. That the claim by both Claimants against the second Defendant, the Egyptian General Company for Tourism and Hotels, be dismissed.\n\n3. That the counterclaim by the said second Defendant against the Claimants be dismissed.\"\n\nIn dismissing the claim against EGOTH, the ICC tribunal added:\n\n\"Different considerations might well apply if the Government had not been a party to the December, 1974 Agreement.\"\n\n69.\n\nOn March 28,1983, the Respondent appealed the ICC award to the French *Cour d\u2019Appel.*\n\n70.\n\nBy a letter dated August 15,1983, SPP(ME) notified the Minister of Tourism that in its view the ICC award \"is binding between the parties and finally dispositive of our dispute.\" At the same time, SPP(ME) added that:\n\n\"recognizing that your Government has taken the position that the ICC award was rendered without a jurisdictional basis, we hereby notify you that we accept and reserve the opportunity of availing ourselves of the uncontestable jurisdiction of the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, under the auspices of the World Bank, which is open to us as a result of Law no 43 of 1974, Article 8 of which provides that investment disputes may be settled by ICSID arbitration.\"\n\n71.\n\nOn July 12, 1984, prior to the institution of the present proceedings, the *Cour d\u2019Appel* annulled the ICC award on the ground that the Respondent was not a party to the December Agreement and therefore was not bound by the arbitration clause contained therein.\n\n72.\n\nOn November 28, 1984, the Claimants referred the decision of the *Cour d\u2019Appel* to the *Cour de Cassation (Pourvoi N\u00b0 84/17/274),* requesting that the decision be set aside. This request was rejected by the *Cour de Cassation* on January 6, 1987.\n\nIII. THE ISSUES REMAINING TO BE DECIDED\n---------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nAs recalled in Section I of this Award, the Tribunal disposed of the jurisdictional issues in two decisions, one issued on November 27,1985 and the other on April 14, 1988. There remain to be decided a number of issues concerning the substantive merits of the case.\n\n*The Applicable Law*\n--------------------\n\n74.\n\nIn addressing the remaining issues, it is appropriate to begin with the question of the law that is to be applied to the Parties\u2019 dispute. Article 42(1) of the Washington Convention provides that:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (ineluding its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Parties have implicitly agreed, in accordance with the first sentence of Article 42(1), to apply Egyptian law. It points out that the Parties\u2019 agreement with respect to the choice of law need not be express, and argues that in this case the choice of Egyptian law results from the preamble of the Heads of Agreement, which refers to Egyptian Laws No. 1 and No. 2 of 1973 and Law No. 43 of 1974. Pointing out that Law No. 43 provides that \"[m]atters not covered by this Law are subject to the applicable laws and regulations,\" the Respondent argues that, according to this provision, \"aucun autre droit que le droit \u00e9gyptien n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi par les parties\" and \"toute lacune doit \u00eatre combl\u00e9e par l\u2019application du droit commun \u00e9gyptien applicable.\"\n\n76.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the second sentence of Article 42(1) is not applicable because it operates only \"[i]n the absence of such agreement....\" Thus, the Respondent argues, the role of international law is a limited one: it cannot be applied directly, but only indireedy through those rules and principles incorporated in Egyptian law such as the provisions of treaties ratified by the ARE and, in particular, the 1972 UNESCO Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, reject the notion that the Parties should be deemed to have agreed implicitly to the exclusive application of Egyptian law. In the Claimants\u2019 view, it is not the first sentence but the second sentence of Article 42(1) which becomes operative, so that the Tribunal should apply the \"law of the Contracting State party... and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" The Claimants acknowledge that their investment in Egypt was governed primarily by Law No. 43 of1974, but they contend that the provisions of Law No. 43 do not cover every aspect of the dispute and that there is no agreement between the Parties on the rules of law to be applied by the Tribunal. In the absence of agreement, the Claimants argue, the second sentence of Article 42 (1) must apply.\n\n78.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Parties\u2019 disagreement as to the manner in which Article 42 is to be applied has very little, if any, practical significance. Both Parties agree that Law No. 43 is applicable to their dispute. Nor is there any question that the UNESCO Convention is relevant: the Claimants themselves acknowledged during the proceedings before the French *Cour d\u2019Appel* that the Convention obligated the Respondent to abstain from acts or contracts contrary to the Convention, stating:\n\n\"que les Et\u00e2ts \u00e9taient susceptibles d\u2019engager leur responsabilit\u00e9 internationale envers les autres Etats signataires en persistant dans des actes ou contrats devenus contraires aux r\u00e8gles de b Convention.\"\n\n79.\n\nMoreover, a consultation filed by the Respondent states:\n\n\"que si on applique 1\u2019 Article 42, al. 1er., 2\u00e8me phrase, le r\u00e9sultat est le m\u00eame, les m\u00eames sources du droit r\u00e9gissant les m\u00eames rapports.\"\n\n80.\n\nFinally, even accepting the Respondent\u2019s view that the Parties have implicitly agreed to apply Egyptian law, such an agreement cannot entirely exclude the direct applicability of international law in certain situations. The law of the ARE, like all municipal legal systems, is not complete or exhaustive, and where a lacunae occurs it cannot be said that there is agreement as to the application of a rule of law which, *ex hypothesi,* does not exist. In such case, it must be said that there is \"absence of agreement\" and, consequently, the second sentence of Article 42(1) would come into play.\n\n81.\n\nThe Respondent has contended that certain acts of Egyptian officials upon which the Claimants rely are, under Egyptian law, legally non-existent or absolutely null and void. Specifically, the Respondent has assailed the validity of Presidential Decree No. 475 of1975 because, *inter alia,* certain areas covered by the decree overlapped land which had been designated \"public utilities (antiquities)\" by an *arr\u00eat\u00e9* of the Minister of Education issued in 1955. The Respondent argues that the quality of public domain is dominant and gives its character and nature to the whole area. The Respondent contends that because the public domain is inalienable and because the establishment of a usufruct constitutes an act of alienation, it follows that such an act would be absolutely null and void. The Respondent argues further that certain decisions of high-ranking government officials are invalid because they were not taken pursuant to the procedures prescribed by Egyptian law.\n\n82.\n\nIt is possible that under Egyptian law certain acts of Egyptian officials, including even Presidential Decree No. 475, may be considered legally nonexistent or null and void or susceptible to invalidation. However, these acts were cloaked with the mantle of Governmental authority and communicated as such to foreign investors who relied on them in making their investments.\n\n83.\n\nWhether legal under Egyptian law or not, the acts in question were the acts of Egyptian authorities, including the highest executive authority of the Government. These acts, which are now alleged to have been in violation of the Egyptian municipal legal system, created expectations protected by established principles of international law. A determination that these acts are null and void under municipal law would not resolve the ultimate question of liability for damages suffered by the victim who relied on the acts. If the municipal law does not provide a remedy, the denial of any remedy whatsoever cannot be the final answer.\n\n84.\n\nWhen municipal law contains a lacunae, or international law is violated by the exclusive application of municipal law, the Tribunal is bound in accordance with Article 42 of the Washington Convention to apply directly the relevant principles and rules of international law. As explained by one of the authors of the Washington Convention, such a process\n\n\"will not involve the confirmation or denial of the validity of the host State\u2019s law, but may result in not applying it where that law, or action taken under that law, violates international law.\" (A. Broches, \"The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States,\" Recueil des Cours, vol. 136, at p. 342 (1972).)\n\n85.\n\nThe principle of international law which the Tribunal is bound to apply is that which establishes the international responsibility of States when unauthorized or *ultra vires* acts of officials have been performed by State agents under cover of their official character. If such unauthorized or *ultra vires* acts could not be ascribed to the State, all State responsibility would be rendered illusory. For this reason,\n\n\"... the practice of states has conclusively established the international responsibility for unlawful acts of state organs, even if accomplished outside the limits of their competence and contrary to domestic law.\" (Sorensen (ed.), Manual of Public International Law, New York, 1968, at p. 548.)\n\n*The Change of Site*\n--------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent, in its Counter-Memorial and in the oral proceedings, has dealt extensively with what it describes as a \"new fact\" to which it attaches great importance, namely, that the project sites shown on the maps attached to the Heads of Agreement and the \"Confidential Report\" referred to in the December Agreement were for the most part outside and below the Pyramids Plateau and thus were different than the site where the project was finally implemented. The Respondent points out that four sites were delineated on the map that was signed by the Minister of Tourism and SPP and attached to the Heads of Agreement. Two of these sites were completely outside the Pyramids Plateau area; a third site\u2014the second largest\u2014was on the southwestern side of the Plateau and was nearer to the Sixth of October City than to the Plateau center; and the fourth site, which was quite small, was on the edge of the Plateau proper. The Respondent further points out that the Heads of Agreement recited that:\n\n\"the Ministry of Tourism approved granting both 2nd and 3rd party the right to develop the areas as shown in the attached maps....\"\n\nand then provided:\n\n\"Each complex will be developed according to a detailed Master Plan prepared and submitted by S.P.P. and approved by E.G.O.T.H. in accordance with and shown in the attached maps.\"\n\nConsequently, the Respondent contends, the project with respect to which the Claimants seek compensation is not the project that the Respondent agreed to in the Heads of Agreement. According to the Respondent,\n\n\"A quick glance at the real map attached as \"Annex A\" to the \"Heads of Agreement\", and by reference to which the obligations of the Ministry of Tourism regarding the securing of title to the land and the establishment of a right of usufruct, shows that it contains not one compact site on top of the Pyramids Plateau, *the limits of which are clearly delineated on the map itself,* but in fact four sites.... It is clear that the sites indicated in the \"Heads of Agreement\" concluded with the M.T. [Ministry of Tourism] are quite different, in fact have very little in common, with the single site to which the Claimants climbed with their project on top of the Pyramids Plateau.\"\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the same pattern of several separate sites, situated for the most part outside of the Plateau area, more or less repeats itself in the map attached to the \"Confidential Report\" referred to in the December Agreement. In contrast, the Respondent points out, the site shown on the map attached to the \"Preliminary Agreement of Incorporation\" of ETDC, signed by EGOTH and SPP on November 23, 1975, sits all in one piece on top of the Plateau. The Respondent alleges that from the start the Claimants had been pressing for, and contriving to get, a single site on top of the Plateau, while the Egyptian authorities were adamant that the project should be implemented on several sites surrounding the Plateau.\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this alteration of the agreed location of the project violated the Heads of Agreement and encroached upon an area protected by both Egyptian law and international law. According to the Respondent, the violation of the Heads of Agreement in respect of the sites was part of a larger design to transform the project into a \"housing and urban development project\" and entailed the violation of other imperative laws of the ARE concerning the protection of antiquities, urban development and the right of foreigners to own land in Egypt.\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, recognize that the map attached to the Heads of Agreement indicated four sites identified as \"General Development Areas,\" none of which corresponds to the eventual project site (although the eventual site overlapped in small part two of the sites shown on the map). The Claimants assert, however, that the project site ultimately settled upon was agreed to and repeatedly endorsed by the Respondent. They contend that the evidence shows that Egyptian authorities suggested the Plateau site in the first place; that the Parties then proceeded to discuss and define the site together; and that by January of 1975 (at the latest) the Respondent had established\u2014 and all Parties had agreed to\u2014the final site and that details of the site were approved in numerous decrees and other official documents. As evidence of these contentions, the Claimants call attention to a report of April 1975 on infrastructure availability at the Pyramids site which was commissioned by SPP and which refers to extensive and recorded consultations concerning the final site with numerous Egyptian Government organizations and contains several maps outlining the Plateau site.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the map mentioned in the Heads of Agreement only indicated a number of possible development areas and that the precise location of the project was under discussion both prior to and after the signing of the Heads of Agreement. In this connection, the Claimants point to Article 4 of the December Agreement, which provided:\n\n\"ETDC will undertake the development and management of both projects within the general Emits described in the maps attached to the Heads of Agreement, and in general accord with the Confidential Report, and as detailed in the Master Plans to be prepared. Each Master Plan shall recognize the appropriate regional plan and shall specify the various zones for different types of development and shall include the location and description as well as the stages and priorities of all tourist facilities.\n\n\u2026\n\nFor the Pyramids area there will be defined within the Master Plan area, the project site area of not less than 10,000 (ten thousand) feddans (approximately 10,000 acres) to which EGOTH will receive title and ETDC the right of usufruct as provided in Articles 5 and 6 hereinafter and within which 5,000 (five thousand) feddans (approximately 5,000 acres) will be developed. The remainder will be parkland and other recreational facilities available for public use within the Master Plan.\"\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the December Agreement was \"[a]p-proved, agreed and ratified\" by the Minister of Tourism, and that knowledge of its contents\u2014and particularly Article 4\u2014must therefore be imputed to the Ministry. Article 4, according to the Claimants, makes clear that none of the parties to the Heads of Agreement\u2014the Ministry of Tourism, EGOTH or SPP \u2014considered the project site to have been finally determined by the Heads of Agreement or the maps annexed thereto.\n\n92.\n\nIn response, the Respondent argues that the words \"as detailed in the Master Plan to be prepared\" in Article 4 of the December Agreement meant no more than that the master plan was to give the details of the project within the general limits described in the maps attached to the Heads of Agreement and the Confidential Report, and was not intended to derogate from those Emits. The Respondent also contends that the change of site occurred without the knowledge of the President of Egypt, who had authorized the project on the basis of the original maps.\n\n93.\n\nFrom the evidence, it is not clear precisely when the decision was made to locate the project on the Pyramids Plateau or whether the decision was taken at the initiative of the Claimants or of the Respondent. Resolution of these questions is not necessary to a decision in this case, however. Several documents in the record demonstrate conclusively that, even if the change of site was initiated by the Claimants, Egyptian authorities at the highest levels knew of and agreed to the final selection of the site on the Pyramids Plateau.\n\n94.\n\nThe most conclusive of these documents is Presidential Decree No. 475 of May 22, 1975. This decree was preceded by a draft decree submitted by the Minister of Tourism on March 30, 1975, together with a memorandum which referred to \"two touristic zones *on the Plateau* of the Pyramids and at Ras El Hekma.\" On this basis, Presidential Decree No. 475 provided in Article 1 that:\n\n\"The lands lying *on* each of *the plateau of the pyramids* and Ras-El-Hekma and whose features and dimensions are determined on the map and in the attached memorandum are assigned for the touristic utilization and the General Egyptian establishment for Tourism and Hotels itself or through one of its contributing companies will reconstruct and utilize these two areas.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nUnfortunately, the map referred to in Presidential Decree No. 475 was not placed in evidence by either Party. Nevertheless, the record establishes unambiguously that, in implementing Decree No. 475, the Egyptian Government\u2014acting through and represented by a number of different agencies\u2014 authorized the location of the project site on the Plateau.\n\n95.\n\nIn its Counter-Reply, the Respondent alleges that certain administrative requirements were not observed with respect to the map referred to in Presidential Decree No. 475:\n\n\"the map of the Pyramids site which was said to accompany the Presidential Decree no. 475 for the year 1975 allocating the Pyramids land to EGOTH was never published in the official Gazette as the law requires.... Nor did these maps accompany the demand submitted for the registration of the Republic Decree with the Real Estate Registration Depart-ment\u2014as law requires\u2014on which ETDC ultimately bases its legal right of usufruct of the land....\"\n\nBut even if such publication and registration was required by Egyptian law, it was the responsibility of the Respondent and not of the Claimants. Moreover, these alleged defects in the administrative registration of the site do not alter the fact that Presidential Decree No. 475 referred expressly to \"[t]he lands lying on... the plateau of the pyramids.\"\n\n96.\n\nNor can the Tribunal overlook the fact that, subsequent to the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 475, the Egyptian authorities repeatedly approved the location of the project on the Plateau. This approval took various forms. For example, the Minister of Tourism signed the contract of November 23, 1975, between EGOTH and SPP(ME), incorporating ETDC. This contract referred to maps annexed to it which located the project on the Plateau. The incorporation of ETDC as provided for in this contract was subsequently authorized by the Ministry of Economy and Economic Cooperation in Decree No. 212 of 1975.\n\n97.\n\nIn February of 1976, four separate Governmental committees\u2014the EGOTH Committee, the Pyramids Plateau Committee, the Egyptian Tourist Development Committee and the Committee for Giza Survey Department\u2014 participated in the physical demarcation of the initial 4,000 feddan portion of the 10,000 feddan site on the Plateau.\n\n98.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the final master plan required by the Heads of Agreement\u2014after being submitted to and commented upon by various Governmental agencies\u2014placed the project on the Plateau. This definitive master plan was formally approved by both EGOTH and the Ministry of Tourism, the two Governmental parties to the Heads of Agreement.\n\n99.\n\nIn this connection, it should be noted that, even if the parties to the Heads of Agreement had intended when they signed the Heads of Agreement on September 23, 1974 that the project be located on the sites shown on the annexed map, those parties were certainly free to agree to a different site at some subsequent time; and it is clear that on April 1, 1976, when the Ministry of Tourism approved the master plan, all of the parties to the Heads of Agreement were in agreement that the project would be located on the Pyramids Plateau and not in the areas shown on the map annexed to the Heads of Agreement.\n\n*The Nature of the Project*\n---------------------------\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondent, in its Counter-Memorial and in the oral proceedings, has argued that in reality the project was not a tourist destination project but rather an urban land and housing development project, and thus was in violation of Article 4 of Law No. 43, which provides:\n\n\"Housing projects, constructed for the purpose of investment, may be undertaken only by Arab capital; foreign capital may not undertake housing projects even in participation with Egyptian capital.\"\n\nThe Respondent points out that Article 3 (iii) of the same law defines \"projects for housing and for urban development\" as:\n\n\"investment in the division of land into parcels and the construction of - new buildings together with the public utilities connected therewith.\"\n\nThe Respondent contends that this is precisely what the Claimants did in implementing the Pyramids Oasis Project: their purpose, as revealed in internal memoranda, was to remedy \"the acute shortage of quality accommodation\" in Cairo and profit from \"the demand for recreational and second home accommodation,\" providing Cairo with \"its first, recreational oriented suburb.\" The Respondent alleges that the Claimants\u2019 prime objective was to sell vacant building lots to Egyptians for Egyptian currency in order to obtain cash for their investment. It was asserted in this respect that the Claimants did not have the right to rent or sell vacant lots.\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the project was \"a real estate operation involving the division of land\" and was therefore subject to Law No. 52 of 1940 Concerning the Division of Land for the Purpose of Building. The Respondent points out that Article 1 of Law No. 52 defines \"division\" as:\n\n\"every parcelling of a piece of land to a number of pieces with the purpose of offering them for sale, barter, lease or \"hekr\" in order to construct building on them if one of these pieces is not connected with an existing road.\"\n\nand that Article 9 requires that:\n\n\"Approval of the division shall be established by a Decree published in the Official Gazette. The publication of the Decree entails the annexation of public roads, squares, gardens and parks to the State\u2019s public property.\"\n\nFinally, the Respondent points to Article 10 of Law No. 52, which provides:\n\n\"Shall be forbidden the sale of the divided land, its lease or its \"tahkir\" before the issued of Decree referred to in the previous article and before the deposit in the mortgage office of a certified copy of that decree as well as of the list of conditions referred to in Article 7.\n\nShall also be forbidden the construction of buildings or the execution of work on the divided land before the issuance of the said Decree.\"\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the violation of an imperative law such as Law No. 43 of 1974 or Law No. 52 of 1940 renders the violating act null and void and the whole project annullable.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimants, on the other hand, maintain that the sale of villa lots by ETDC was an integral part of the tourist destination concept and was fundamental to the proposals that SPP made to the Egyptian Government, since the lot sales were what made the project largely self-financing. The Claimants allege that representatives of the Government were fully advised of the concept and approved it. They also point out that lot sales had been used to finance SPP\u2019s project in Fiji, which the Respondent\u2019s representatives visited and studied prior to approving the Pyramids Oasis Project. In this connection, the Claimants recall that the Heads of Agreement referred to the plan to develop \"interlinked residential and tourist destination complexes\" and provided that the joint company \"will be free to rent, lease, manage or assign any site... in both local and foreign markets...\", and that the December Agreement provided that \"ETDC shall be free to assign its right of usufruct and to rent, lease, manage, promote or assign any site... in both local and foreign markets.\"\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants also draw attention to the November 23, 1975 joint venture contract\u2014the \"Preliminary Agreement of Incorporation\"\u2014between SPP(ME) and EGOTH, which provided that ETDC\n\n\"may buy, sell right of usufruct, lease, rent the desert lands in the Pyramids and Ras El-Hekma sites (on the Mediterranean Coast) for touristic purposes.\"\n\nand Article 7 of the resolution of the Board of EGOTH transferring the right of usufruct to ETDC, which stated:\n\n\"ETDC will have full authority and power... to transfer sell or lease the right of usufruct of any part of the sites to be developed to a third party without any restriction....\"\n\n105.\n\nWith respect to Law No. 52 of 1940, the Claimants allege that the Egyptian Government assured ETDC that this law was not applicable. In support of this allegation, the Claimants have submitted a letter dated February 9, 1977, from the GIA to ETDC\u2019s attorney, which stated:\n\n\"We would like to inform you that said company is not subject to Law 52/1940, concerning the subdivision of lands to be developed, whereas said subdivisions are out of the boundaries of cities and villages included among the resolution of Minister of Housing, but said subdivisions are governed by Law 2/1973, regarding tourist establishments.\"\n\n106.\n\nIn the opinion of the Tribunal, the sale to Cairo residents of villa sites where dwellings for permanent use might subsequently be erected did not detract from or conflict with the \"interlinked residential and tourist destination\" concept. An integrated tourist complex, which included hotels, apartments and villas as well as recreational facilities, would not lose its tourist nature or become a forbidden housing development simply because Cairo residents might purchase lots for weekend or second home accommodation or even for permanent residence. Indeed, the potential market of buyers described in the master plan approved by the Egyptian authorities included:\n\n\"3. The retirement market for foreign and domestic investors.\n\n4. The foreign and domestic residential market including first and second homes (week-end villas, etc.).\"\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal also heard uncontroverted testimony that in other resort areas local purchasers are attracted by the potential returns that can be earned from letting their furnished villas to tourists.\n\n108.\n\nMoreover, a number of features which further the objective of tourist development differentiated this project from most housing development projects. For example, all purchasers of lots in the Pyramids Oasis Project were obliged to build villas within a limited period in order to contribute to the establishment of tourist facilities. The contract of sale for each lot contained a declaration to the effect\n\n\"that the Development covered by the sub-division plan is being developed as an integrated tourist and residential complex and that the covenants, conditions and restrictions herein contained are part of a *common* plan to benefit each and every lot in the Development.\"\n\nAmong the \"covenants, conditions and restrictions\" referred to were obligations to build within a prescribed period of time, to refrain from subdivision of the lot or the erection of temporary buildings, to obtain approval of the seller for any building works, to erect only one private house, to observe the building height prescribed for the particular lot and to refrain from conducting any business or trade on the lot. Some of these restrictions were enacted by decree of the Ministry of Tourism.\n\n109.\n\nThe evidence also shows that the Ministry of Tourism and other Egyptian authorities such as the GIA not only knew, but agreed, that the financing of the projects infra-structure was to be obtained in large part through the sale of vacant lots. The application to the GIA for the incorporation of ETDC specified that the financing of the project would come from \"the sale and rent of the utilisations\u2019 right in respect of sites\" and that \"the profits accruing from the project comes through the utilisation of villa sites.\" Details of the plan to sell building sites were set forth in three separate reports submitted to the GIA prior to its approval of the project and in the master plan approved by the Minister of Tourism.\n\n110.\n\nVarious agencies and instrumentalities of the Egyptian Government, including the Giza Committee, the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction, the Ministry of Tourism, EGOTH and the GIA, approved or participated in the project with full knowledge that it would be largely financed by the sale of building sites. There is nothing in the record which indicates that any of these agencies or instrumentalities ever questioned the legality of the lot sales. Unless one assumes that these agencies and instrumentalities knowingly acted in disregard of Egyptian law, it is apparent that none of them considered the lot sales to be illegal or to render the project a \"housing\" project for purposes of Egyptian law.\n\n111.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that two reports prepared by the Respondent\u2019s financial experts and placed in evidence by the Respondent appear to acknowledge that the project was in fact a tourist project. The first of these reports, prepared by Peat Marwick Mclintock, stated:\n\n\"It seems clear that the first stated object of ETDC was to develop international tourism within Egypt. We are not lawyers, but our interpretation as accountants of Article 3 as a whole is that other activities specified were either to facilitate this main aim or were ancillary to it. The stated objectives do not appear to rule out the division and sale of land (see Article 36\u2019.. the sale buying and leasing of property of all kinds within the Arab Republic of Egypt.\u2019) provided that any such activity serves the overall objective of tourist development.\"\n\nThe second report, prepared by Hazem Hassan & Co., stated:\n\n\"The prime objective of ETDC (as stated in its statutes which was published in the official Gazette in December 4, 1975) was to develop International tourism in both the Pyramids Plateau and Ras El Hekma areas through the establishment of hotels, theatres, restaurants, amusement parks, touristic residential areas, touristic villages, clubs, cafes and other touristic establishments, using the most modem methods in tourism development.\"\n\n112.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal cannot accept the contention that the Pyramids Oasis Project was in reality a housing project, the implementation of which would have violated the various imperative laws of the ARE that have been invoked by the Respondent.\n\n*The Financial and Technical Capacity of the Claimants*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent contends that SPP misrepresented its financial capacity and its tourism expertise when it proposed the Pyramids Oasis Project to the Egyptian Government and that the Claimants in fact lacked the ability to complete the project. In support of these contentions the Respondent has produced reports by financial experts which conclude, *inter alia,* that during the period 1972-1977 SPP\u2019s net assets per share and cover for its interest declined; that SPP had experienced certain financial difficulties with its operations in Fiji and Australia; and that ETDC apparently would have required other forms of finance to facilitate development of the Pyramids Oasis Project, including loan finance and revenues from lot sales.\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, maintain that SPP\u2019s experience and history, and that of its principals, were a matter of public record and were thoroughly investigated by Egyptian authorities prior to approval of the project. They point out that the Respondent even sent representatives to Fiji to study SPP\u2019s operation there. They further note that the allegations concerning SPP\u2019s financial and technical capacity were raised in February of 1978 in the People\u2019s Assembly where they were firmly rebutted by the Government.\n\n115.\n\nWith respect to the alleged financial difficulties in Fiji and Australia, the Claimants maintain that these were of a transitory character, that the economic crisis precipitated by the oil embargo in November of 1973 had a damaging effect on international tourism worldwide, and that SPP\u2019s situation improved subsequently to the point where its South Pacific hotel operation was sold in 1981 to a third party for US $120,500,000.\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal will first note that the reports of financial experts relied upon by the Respondent do not conclude that the Claimants would have been unable to complete the Pyramids Oasis Project; rather, the reports state that SPP had encountered certain financial difficulties and conclude\u2014consistent with what the Claimants have argued\u2014that financing of the project was dependent on lot sales.\n\n117.\n\nMore importantly, the evidence shows that SPP had obtained at the required times the funds necessary to finance the Pyramids Oasis Project according to the agreements that had been concluded and the method of financing that had been envisaged. Under the December Agreement, SPP was to \"arrange for\" US $20,000,000 in financing over the first four years and \"ensure\" that all additional financing for both the Pyramids Oasis and Ras El Hekma Projects (total costs for both projects were estimated to be US $400,000,000) would be provided by short and long term loans. SPP arranged the US $20,000,000 of financing through a US $12,000,000 share issue to Triad Holding Corporation S.A. and sales of SPP(ME) shares to two members of the Saudi Arabian royal family totalling US $8,750,000.\n\n118.\n\nPursuant to the joint venture agreement of November 23, 1975 between EGOTH and SPP(ME), the latter was to make capital contributions to ETDC as follows:\n\n*Year Amount*\n\n1 $510,000\n\n2 $400,000\n\n3 $400,000\n\n4 $400,000\n\n5 $330,000\n\nThe first three payments were made on or before the due date. The project was cancelled before the fourth payment was due.\n\n119.\n\nUnder the loan agreement of April 15, 1976, SPP(ME) granted ETDC a loan facility of up to US $15,000,000. At the time the project was cancelled, SPP(ME) had advanced ETDC US $1,650,000, plus interest, under the loan agreement.\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimants engaged various consultants to undertake the design and planning of the project. In June of 1977, a contract was awarded for the initial civil works and construction began on the site the following month. This construction involved roads, sewage systems, water reservoir facilities, artificial lakes and a golf course. In addition, the design work for two hotels had been completed. At the time of cancellation, ETDC had spent over US $9,500,000 on development costs.\n\n121.\n\nThe evidence shows that the subsequent difficulties encountered by ETDC in obtaining financing for the hotels were due in large part to the failure of the Egyptian authorities to provide certain infrastructure services and to obtain customs clearance for materials and equipment imported for the project. The Heads of Agreement provided that the Ministry of Tourism would\n\n\"take appropriate measures to ensure the provision of basic infrastructure by Government to the boundaries of the sites.\"\n\nThe December Agreement provided that EGOTH would\n\n\"use its best efforts to ensure that basic suitable infrastructure is provided to the boundaries of the respective areas at no cost to SPP or ETDC, such infrastructure to comprise roads, water supply, power supply, telephone facilities and ancillary public utilities, all of which shall be sufficient for the adequate development of each area.\"\n\nand that EGOTH would\n\n\"assist in acquiring permits for obtaining materials and supplies necessary for the projects.\"\n\nDuring the months preceding the cancellation of the project, SPP(ME) wrote to EGOTH and the Ministry of Tourism repeatedly, stating that the failure of the Government to provide infrastructure to the project\u2019s boundary and to clear equipment and materials through customs was jeopardizing the further financing of the project.\n\n122.\n\nIt is also apparent from the evidence that opposition to the project in Egypt and the resulting uncertainties about its future further contributed to the reluctance of foreign investors to participate in joint ventures for the construction and operation of the hotels.\n\n123.\n\nAs to the Claimants\u2019 financial means, the record shows that the Parties understood and accepted that most of the costs to be incurred for the project would be \"self-financed,\" that is, financed with revenues generated by the project itself. Thus, the infrastructure was to be financed by lot sales, as had been done in the Fiji operation. The self-financing aspect of the project was explained by the Minister of Tourism and the Minister of Economy and Economic Cooperation in statements to the People\u2019s Assembly, as follows:\n\n\"The finance of the project is based originally on the concept of self-financing to every step, considering that the project is enormous and needs a large amount of financing, and can not be based on the principle of owned capital of the project, otherwise it will need an enormous capital which is not possible for any company to provide. For this reason the finance will follow gradually the implemented portions of the project which its revenue will be re-invested to implement the following stages.\"\n\n124.\n\nIt is also evident that the Claimants had substantial experience and expertise in the tourism business prior to becoming involved in the Pyramids Oasis Project. At the hearings held in The Hague on July 10\u201411, 1985, Mr. Peter Munk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SPP, stated that SPP was founded in 1960 for the purpose of developing tourist resorts; that SPP developed only tourist resorts and facilities; that it was the largest hotel owner in Australia, Fiji and New Guinea; that it operated in seven countries and employed over 5,000 people; and that its major shareholders included the P&O Steamship Company and Jardine Matheson.\n\n125.\n\nMoreover, the Egyptian Government itself confirmed SPP\u2019s experience in the tourist resort business before entering into the December Agreement. In a letter published in *Al-Akhbar* on September 4, 1977, the Minister of Tourism stated:\n\n\"we like to make clear that the General Egyptian Company entered into the contract with S.P.P. only after enquiring about the said company through our Embassy in London and our consulate in Hong Kong and through the relevant security authorities and banks. The company submitted documentary evidence of its capabilities and competence before the Egyptian Company decided to enter into contract. It is important to say that this company is a holding company and has other subsidiaries. Some of the shareholders are companies with international reputations such as the P. V.[sic] O. and the Hotels Company.\"\n\nAnd in a written answer to the People\u2019s Assembly, the Minister of Tourism stated that the delegation of Egyptian officials which travelled to Fiji \"for the purpose of visiting the project which SPP had erected there and to examine its standards of planning, construction, management, marketing and profits,\" had \"certified that the Company has a high degree of expertise, excellent capabilities and the full ability to perform the project.\"\n\n126.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal must reject the contention that the Claimants lacked the requisite expertise and experience to properly implement the Pyramids Oasis Project.\n\n*The Allegation of Irregular Contacts and Connections*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s pleadings contain repeated allusions to irregular contacts and business connections on the part of the Claimants. The Respondent also alleges that certain individuals upon leaving Government service were employed by the Claimants. Finally, it is alleged that the Claimants bypassed normal Government channels of communication and went \"right to the top.\" On these grounds, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to declare that:\n\n\"les demandes de SPP et SPP(ME) sont irrecevables et en tout cas mal fond\u00e9es en raison des faits de corruption que r\u00e9v\u00e8lent les comportements de SPP et SPP(ME).\"\n\n128.\n\nNowhere, however, is there any specific allegation of unlawful conduct on the part of the Claimants which could conceivably vitiate the relevant agreements or excuse non-performance of the Respondent\u2019s obligations under those agreements. The Respondent, at the end of its Counter-Reply, in effect admits the lack of concrete evidence in this respect when it states:\n\n\"Indeed nothing we have said in our Counter-Memorial or Counter-Reply should be construed as an accusation, or allegation of misconduct regarding any particular Egyptian Official referred [to]....\"\n\nThe particular persons whom the Respondent has exempted from any allegation of misconduct are the very same persons who established the initial contacts with the Claimants, who invited the Claimants to visit Egypt for the first time, and who\u2014as high ranking authorities in the Government\u2014were called upon to make important decisions with respect to the project.\n\n129.\n\nWhen the Pyramids Oasis Project was under consideration in the People\u2019s Assembly, the Vice Speaker, Dr. Gamal El Oteify, put a number of questions to the Minister of Tourism concerning \"the agreement concluded with the foreign company concerning the tourist exploitation of the Pyramids Plateau and the Ras el Hekma site.\" Among these was the following:\n\n\"Was there any intermediary involved in the conclusion of this agreement?\"\n\nThe Minister answered in writing as follows:\n\n\"The Note presented to the Supreme Committee for Economic and Political Planning in its session dated April 27, 1975, is attached herewith. This certifies that there were no intermediaries in this agreement.\"\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent has questioned the English translation of the Minister\u2019s answer, asserting that instead of \"This *certifies* that there were no intermediaries in this agreement,\" the Arabic original should be translated as \"It *appears* from this that there was no intermediation in (for) this agreement.\" It is not necessary, however, for the Tribunal to resolve this question of translation. Even if the Respondent\u2019s translation is accepted, the answer, emanating from the Minister of Tourism and addressed to the People\u2019s Assembly, is sufficient to show that the Egyptian authorities at the time were satisfied that no intermediaries had been involved in the making of the agreement.\n\n131.\n\nThe record also shows that, before entering into any commitments with the Claimants, the Egyptian authorities made a number of inquiries through their embassies in Australia and Hong Kong and \"received many letters from international offices which contain many details about this company.\" It must be concluded that those references satisfied the authorities, since they continued negotiating with the Claimants.\n\n132.\n\nThus, the allegations concerning irregular contacts and connections are not supported by the evidence in the record and are based on suppositions, guilt by association and what the Respondent describes as *\"commencement de preuve.\"* On such grounds, it is simply not possible to reach the findings of fact and conclusions requested by the Respondent.\n\n*The Status of SPP and SPP(ME) Under Law No. 43*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe Respondent has raised an objection of admissibility against the claims in this case on the ground\n\n\"1) Que SPP (ME) ne justifie pas que son Projet ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement approuv\u00e9 par le \"Board of Directors\" de l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Investissements (GIA) conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 1\u2019 article 1 de la loi 43/74 et aux articles 33 et suivants du R\u00e9glement 91/1975 portant application de cette loi.\n\n2) Qu\u2019 en cons\u00e9quence, le d\u00e9cret du 4 d\u00e9cembre 1975 du Minist\u00e8re de l'Economie ne peut pas valoir approbation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re ni du Projet de SPP (ME), ni de T incorporation d\u2019 ETDC dans le cadre de la loi 43/74.\"\n\n134.\n\nBy these submissions the Respondent has raised an objection which in its view goes to the very essence of the case: that SPP(ME) does not have the status of an investor under Law No. 43 because the GIA was never asked to consider SPP(ME) as the entity that would make the investment in the Pyramids Oasis Project, and never agreed to extend or transfer to SPP(ME) the authorization which was granted to the parent company, SPP. The Respondent points out that Decree No. 91 of 1975, which contains the regulations for the establishment of new projects under Law No. 43, requires that information concerning the investor be furnished to the GIA. According to the Respondent, the information provided to the GIA in connection with the Pyramids Oasis Project concerned only SPP, not SPP(ME), and the GIA never authorized or approved the substitution of SPP(ME) for SPP as the investor that was to implement the Pyramids Oasis Project under Law No. 43. For these reasons the Respondent contends that SPP(ME) was not an \"approved investor\" under Egyptian law and consequently cannot invoke any rights or privileges derived from Law No. 43.\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that the transfer of rights from SPP to SPP(ME) was never expressly \"authorized\" as such in a GIA document. They maintain, however, that the GIA did in fact approve the substitution of SPP(ME) for SPP as the investor who was to implement the Pyramids Oasis Project under Law No. 43. The Claimants point out that Decree No. 212 of 1975, issued by the Ministry of Economy and Economic Cooperation, authorized the incorporation of a joint venture between SPP(ME) and EGOTH \"[i]n conformity with... [t]he [GIA] Board of Directors\u2019 Resolution No. 50/ 19/1975 at the session of 20th July, 1975; and the memorandum of the Deputy Chairman of the General Authority for Arab Investment dated 1st December 1975.\"\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimants also point out that it was SPP(ME) who in fact made the investment and implemented the authorized joint venture under Law No. 43, and that it was SPP(ME) who supplied the capital contributions and loans in accordance with the foreign investment regulations. The Claimants\u2019 emphasize that the Respondent accepted SPP(ME)\u2019s performance and that it was SPP(ME)\u2019s rights under the contract and as a shareholder in ETDC that were directly affected by the cancellation of the project. Finally, the Claimants recall that Article 17 of the December Agreement provided that:\n\n\"It is understood that SPP will be incorporating a holding company to own its shareholding in ETDC and it is agreed that SPP shall have the right to assign its rights, privileges, duties and obligations under this Agreement to this company in which SPP will have a controlling, but not necessarily majority, interest and in which it controls and directs management, provided the company satisfies EGOTH.\"\n\n137.\n\nThe gist of the Respondent\u2019s argument is that, for an investment to be protected by Law No. 43, there must be an express and specific decision of the GIA authorizing the company concerned to make the investment, and SPP(ME) cannot produce such an authorization. The Respondent contends that the silence of the GIA with respect to the transfer of rights from SPP to SPP(ME) cannot be deemed a sufficient authorization since the GIA must make an express decision in each case after examining the financial capacity of the party who is to actually make the investment..\n\n138.\n\nTo decide this issue, it is necessary to examine Decree No. 212 and the circumstances surrounding its promulgation. This decree authorized the incorporation of ETDC as a joint venture between EGOTH and SPP(ME), and consequently recognized SPP(ME) as the foreign investor in the project.\n\n139.\n\nAs the Respondent points out, Decree No. 212 was issued by the Ministry of Economy and Economic Cooperation, not by the GIA. However, the GIA played a decisive part in the promulgation of Decree No. 212. As noted above, the recitals in the preamble of this decree include a statement that it was issued \"In conformity with... the memorandum of the Deputy Chairman of the General Authority for Arab Investment dated 1st December, 1975.\" The full text of this memorandum was requested by the Tribunal during the final hearings in Paris and was produced by the Respondent on November 27, 1990. It is true, as the Respondent has observed, that the first page of this memorandum refers to the creation of joint venture with SPP, without mentioning SPP(ME). It is also true that the memorandum refers to a GIA approval dated July 20, 1975, which did not include SPP(ME). However, on the second page of the memorandum, the Deputy Chairman of the GIA stated:\n\n\"Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi n\u00b0 43 de 1974, l\u2019acte pr\u00e9liminaire et le statut ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9s et approuv\u00e9s par l\u2019Organisme public de l\u2019investissement.\n\nEn date du 29/11/1975 n\u00b0 11, les deux associ\u00e9s ont homologu\u00e9 les signatures au bureau d\u2019enregistrement des activit\u00e9s d'investissement cr\u00e9\u00e9 au si\u00e8ge de l\u2019Organisme \u201a et ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la preuve du d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00e0 la Banque nationale Egyptienne, du quart du capital en num\u00e9raires souscrit pour la premi\u00e8re phase.\"\n\nThere can be no doubt that the corporate documents which, according to the memorandum, were revised and approved by the GIA were those incorporating ETDC, i.e., the Preliminary Agreement of Incorporation *(\"I\u2019acte pr\u00e9liminaire\")* between EGOTH and SPP(ME), and ETDC\u2019s articles of incorporation and by-laws. Thus, the substitution of SPP(ME) for SPP was not only known to, but also approved by, the GIA.\n\n140.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed by the express reference to the two joint venture partners *(\"les deux associ\u00e9s\")* who\u2014according to the memorandum\u2014on November 20,1975 deposited their authorized signatures at the GIA offices and submitted proof that SPP(ME) had deposited its capital contribution with the National Bank of Egypt.\n\n141.\n\nThe memorandum also shows that Decree No. 212 was actually drafted at the GIA and then submitted to the Minister of Economy and Economic Cooperation for his signature. It is legitimate to infer from this document that the GIA not only knew of the transfer of rights from SPP to SPP(ME), but also reviewed and approved such transfer, which included the rights resulting from Law No. 43 of 1974.\n\n142.\n\nFinally, if anything more were needed to establish the status of SPP(ME) as an \"approved investor\" under Law No. 43, the statement of the Deputy Chairman of the GIA that the Preliminary Agreement of Incorporation between SPP(ME) and EGOTH of November 23, 1975, as well as ETDC\u2019s articles of incorporation and by-laws, had been revised and approved by the GIA is, in the Tribunal s view, conclusive.\n\n143.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the regulations implementing Law No. 43 do not envisage the GIA granting formal approval of an investor by means of a memorandum, and that Decree No. 212, if so interpreted, might be considered null and void. There are, however, no apparent irregularities in this instrument. The memorandum was signed by the Deputy Chairman of the GIA Board because the Minister, who presided over the Board, could not sign a decision addressed to himself For this reason, the GIA\u2019s decision was communicated by the Deputy Chairman of the GIA in the form of a memorandum addressed to the Minister.\n\n144.\n\nThus, the evidence shows that the GIA knew that it was SPP(ME) who was in fact making the investment and performing the investor\u2019s other obligations under the relevant agreements, and that the GIA, acting pursuant to Law No. 43, approved the joint venture between SPP(ME) and EGOTH that was formed to implement the project. In these circumstances, SPP(ME) must be deemed an investor entitled to the protections of Law No. 43.\n\n145.\n\nAt the hearings, the Claimants took the position that if SPP(ME)\u2019s status as a foreign investor could not be recognized under Egyptian law, then SPP would advance the claim in its own name. This position was based on the fact that the parent company, SPP, joined the present proceedings as a second claimant at the request of the Respondent. It announced its voluntary intervention in the hearings held in The Hague on July 10-11, 1985. This intervention was formally agreed to by the Respondent, whose Counsel subscribed a declaration reading:\n\n\"Cette intervention est not\u00e9e et accept\u00e9e par la RAE sous les m\u00eames r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 l\u2019incomp\u00e9tence du CIRDI que celles invoqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de SPP (Middle East) Ltd.\"\n\n146.\n\nIn its decision of November 27,1985, the Tribunal took notice that:\n\n\"On July 23, 1985, the Parties advised the Centre that Southern Pacific Properties Limited (hereinafter called \"SPP\" or \"the Claimant\"), the parent Company of SPP(ME) and also a Hong Kong Corporation, had been joined as a claimant in the proceedings, subject to Egypt\u2019s reservation of jurisdictional defenses.\"\n\n147.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s reservation referred only to the preliminary objections then raised by the Respondent concerning the competence of the Centre. These preliminary objections were dismissed by the Tribunal in its decisions of November 27, 1985 and April 24, 1988.\n\n148.\n\nThe objection now raised is a different one, and thus is not covered by the reservation. It does not concern jurisdiction but refers instead to the admissibility of the request on a ground pertaining to the merits. The Respondent has contested the argument concerning the validity of SPP\u2019s claims, observing that:\n\n\"Que SPP n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans ses m\u00e9moires \u00e9crits aucune demande pour son compte; que les demandes de paiement \u00e0 son profit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es verbalement et subsidiairement au cours des audiences des 3/11 septembre 1990, sont irrecevables comme \u00e9tant tardives et non conformes aux dispositions du R\u00e9glement de Proc\u00e9dure d\u2019Arbitrage du CIRDI; qu\u2019au surplus, elles n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assorties d\u2019aucune justification.\"\n\nThis objection concerns the applicability of Rule 40 of the Centre\u2019s Arbitration Rules, which provides in paragraph 2 that:\n\n\"An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply... unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.\"\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent\u2019s contention that a claim by SPP at this point in the proceedings would contravene Rule 40. What is involved here is neither an \"incidental\" nor an \"additional\" claim: SPP was voluntarily joined as a claimant in the case at the Respondent\u2019s request. As a claimant, SPP must be presumed to be claiming something, and there is nothing in the record which suggests that SPP has ever claimed anything different than what SPP(ME) claims. Rather, SPP(ME) and SPP have claimed jointly against the Respondent ever since SPP was joined in the proceedings. *The UNESCO Convention*\n\n150.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the entry into force on December 17, 1975 of the UNESCO Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage made it obligatory, on the international plane, to cancel the Pyramids Oasis Project. In this context, the Respondent relies primarily on Articles 4 and 5 of the Convention. Article 4 provides:\n\n\"Each State Party to this Convention recognizes that the duty of ensuring the identification, protection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations of the cultural and natural heritage referred to in Articles 1 and 2 and situated on its territory, belongs primarily to that State. It will do all it can to this end, to the utmost of its own resources and, where appropriate, with any international assistance and co-operation, in particular, financial, artistic, scientific and technical, which it may be able to obtain.\"\n\nand Article 5(d) provides:\n\n\"To ensure that effective and active measures are taken for the protection, conservation and presentation of the cultural and natural heritage situated on its territory, each State Party to this Convention shall endeavour, in so far as possible, and as appropriate for each country:... to take the appropriate legal, scientific, technical, administrative and financial measures necessary for the identification, protection, conservation, presentation and rehabilitation of this heritage....\"\n\n151.\n\nThe Convention established a body called the \"World Heritage Committee\" to register the property to be protected under the Convention. Article 11 of the Convention provides for such registration as follows:\n\n\"Every State Party to this Convention shall, in so far as possible, submit to the World Heritage Committee an inventory of property forming part of the cultural and natural heritage, situated in its territory and suitable for inclusion in the list provided for in paragraph 2 of this Article....\"\n\n152.\n\nProfessor Kahn, in a consultation submitted by the Respondent, explained the system of the Convention in the following terms:\n\n\"La proc\u00e9dure est divis\u00e9e en deux phases: tout d\u2019abord une phase qui est \u00e0 l\u2019initiative de l\u2019Et\u00e2t de situation qui consiste en une demande d\u2019inscription sur la liste du Patrimoine Mondial des Monuments ou des sites qui r\u00e9pondent aux conditions pos\u00e9es par la Convention; puis une phase d\u2019examen et \u00e9ventuellement d\u2019inscription par le Comit\u00e9 du Patrimoine Mondial. Cette proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9serve la souverainet\u00e9 des Etats (initiative) et \u00e9vite les inscriptions des biens int\u00e9ressants mais non irrempla\u00e7ables et non uniques gr\u00e2ce au contr\u00f4le international.\"\n\n153.\n\nFor their part, the Claimants maintain that the Respondent\u2019s expropriatory acts were not based on the UNESCO Convention and that none of the Convention\u2019s provisions required termination of the project. They point out that the Respondent ratified the Convention on February 7, 1974 and thus was aware of its terms when it authorized the Pyramids Oasis Project more than a year later. The Claimants add that the Convention entered into force on December 17, 1975 and final approval of the master plan occurred in 1976. The Claimants contend that even if antiquities existed on the Plateau, nothing in the Convention required the cancellation of the project, and that measures short of cancellation could have been taken in conformity with the Convention to protect such antiquities. They argue further that the Respondent did not rely on the Convention when it cancelled the project, and that the Respondent has only invoked the Convention as a *post hoc* rationalization for an act of expropriation which in fact had nothing to do with the Convention. In this connection, the Claimants observe that it was only on February 26, 1979\u2014some nine months after the project was cancelled\u2014that the Respondent nominated \"the pyramid fields from Giza to Dahshur\" for inclusion in the World Heritage list under Article 11 of the UNESCO Convention.\n\n154.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the UNESCO Convention by itself does not justify the measures taken by the Respondent to cancel the project, nor does it exclude the Claimants\u2019 right to compensation. According to the system of the Convention, as acknowledged by the Respondent, *\"le classement est finalement le fait des autorit\u00e9s internationales de l\u2019Unesco (Comit\u00e9).\"* Thus, the choice of sites to be protected is not imposed externally, but results instead from the State\u2019s own voluntary nomination. Consequently, the date on which the Convention entered into force with respect to the Respondent is not the date on which the Respondent became obligated by the Convention to protect and conserve antiquities on the Pyramids Plateau. It was only in 1979, after the Respondent nominated \"the pyramid fields\" and the World Heritage Committee accepted that nomination, that the relevant international obligations emanating from the Convention became binding on the Respondent. Consequently, it was only from the date on which the Respondent\u2019s nomination of the \"pyramid fields\" was accepted for inclusion in the inventory of property to be protected in the UNESCO Convention in 1979 that a hypothetical continuation of the Claimants\u2019 activities interfering with antiquities in the area could be considered as unlawful from the international point of view.\n\n*The Existence of Antiquities in the Area*\n------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent has established to the Tribunal\u2019s satisfaction that antiquities exist in the project area. This was confirmed by a number of documents that were placed in evidence by the Respondent. The most conclusive of these is a memorandum prepared by the President of the Egyptian Antiquities Authority in May of 1978 which stated:\n\n\"The follow-up by the Egyptian Antiquities Authority to the works which were carried out has resulted in the following:\n\nFirstly The presence of Antiquities was confirmed in the Western side of A1 Giza Pyramids region which represents the Eastern part of the construction operations carried out. As a result the Egyptian Antiquity Authority has demanded from both the Ministry of Tourism and the Survey Authority to consider this part Public Property (Antiquity) in accordance of the Antiquities Protection Law N\u00b0 215 of the year 1951.\n\nSecondly The scientific evidence mentions the probability of Antiquities present in this important Antiquities region in measuring of what were found in other regions. \"\n\nThis memorandum was submitted to the Ministry of Information and Culture, together with the recommendation that a decree be issued declaring certain lands in the vicinity of the project site to be \"public property (Antiquity).\" The Ministry issued such a decree\u2014Decree No. 90 of 1978\u2014on 27 May 1978, the day before the Pyramids Oasis Project was cancelled.\n\n156.\n\nIn any event, it is not disputed that in 1979 the World Heritage Committee accepted the Respondent\u2019s nomination of \"the pyramid fields\" for inclusion in the inventory of property to be protected by the UNESCO Convention. The Respondent determined\u2014as it was entitled to do under the Convention\u2014that the Pyramids Oasis Project was not compatible with its obligations under the Convention to protect and conserve antiquities in the areas registered with the World Heritage Committee. Admittedly, the registration of these areas occurred somewhat belatedly in the context of the present dispute. However, other of the Respondent\u2019s acts which were contemporaneous with the cancellation of the project indicate the genuineness of the Respondent\u2019s concern for the antiquities at the project site and the legitimacy of the registration of that site under the UNESCO Convention. The most important of these acts was Decree No. 90 of 1978, discussed above (paragraph 157). This decree, which declared lands on the project site to be \"public property (Antiquity),\" was issued pursuant to Law No. 215 of 1951 for the Protection of Monuments and Antiquities, which, as explained more fully below (paragraph 161), authorizes expropriation when necessary to protect antiquities.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s determination that the Claimants\u2019 activities on the Pyramids Plateau would have become internationally unlawful in 1979, but not before that date, has significant consequences in other respects which are discussed below (paragraphs 192-93).\n\n*The Lawfulness of the Measures Taken by the Respondent to Cancel the Project*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nClearly, as a matter of international law, the Respondent was entitled to cancel a tourist development project situated on its own territory for the purpose of protecting antiquities. This prerogative is an unquestionable attribute of sovereignty. The decision to cancel the project constituted a lawful exercise of the right of eminent domain. The right was exercised for a public purpose, namely, the preservation and protection of antiquities in the area. Nor have the Claimants challenged the Respondent\u2019s right to cancel the project. Rather, they claim that the cancellation amounted to an expropriation of their investment for which they are entitled to compensation under both Egyptian law and international law.\n\n159.\n\nThe rules of Egyptian law and international law governing the exercise of the right of eminent domain impose an obligation to indemnify parties whose legitimate rights are affected by such exercise. Article 34 of the Egyptian Constitution provides:\n\n\"Private ownership shall be safeguarded and may not be put under sequestration except in the cases specified in the law and with a judicial decision. It may not be expropriated except for a public purpose and against a fair compensation in accordance with the law. The right of inheritance is guaranteed in it.\"\n\nThe obligation to pay fair compensation in the event of expropriation applies equally where antiquities are involved. Thus, Article 11 of Law No. 215 of 1951 for the Protection of Monuments and Antiquities provides:\n\n\"In the case of accidental discovery of an Antiquity by an individual or an entity, the competent departement has the duty to take the measures necessary for its protection and this as of the date of declaration of the Discovery; within two months thereafter it is incumbent on said department either to remove the Antiquity found on private property (and) (or else) to take the necessary measures of expropriation of the site of the object discovered, or to keep it in situ subject to the requirements of registration pursuant to the present law.\n\nCompensation for expropriated land shall not take into account the value of the Antiquities.\"\n\n*The Legal Nature of the Measures Taken by the Respondent*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent argues on various grounds that there was no compensable taking of the Claimants\u2019 property. The Respondent contends that the cancellation of the project was not a \"nationalization\" or \"confiscation\" prohibited by Law No. 43 of 1974. The Respondent argues further that under Egyptian law expropriation does not apply to contractual and other incorporeal rights, but only to real property rights. Thus, according to the Respondent, while the real property rights of EGOTH and ETDC may have been expropriated, those interests of the Claimants that were affected by the cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis Project were not the kind of interest that is susceptible of expropriation under Egyptian law. The Respondent further contends that, while the contractual rights of the Claimants may have been diminished in their value, they were not expropriated. Moreover, the Respondent adds, the Ras El Hekma Project was never cancelled and the Claimants were offered a substitute site for that on the Plateau, close to the Sixth of October City. This substitute site, according to the Respondent, offered views and other features similar to those of the Plateau area. Finally, the Respondent argues that an offer of compensation in the amount of US $1,500,000 was made in order that the Claimants might pursue alternative projects, and it was only because of SPP(ME)\u2019s arbitrary refusal to pursue such alternatives that the project was ultimately abandoned and no compensation was paid.\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, contend that the Respondent\u2019s arguments ignore economic reality. They maintain that the cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis Project and the publicity engendered thereby created a climate of opinion which made it impossible for the Claimants to raise additional funds in international financial markets and to undertake further investments.\n\n162.\n\nThe evidence shows that, following cancellation of the project, the Prime Minister stated that the Claimants would be compensated for their losses, but no adequate offer of compensation was ever made. The alleged offer of US $1,500,000 did not involve a cash payment. Rather, the offer was to credit ETDC with an investment of US $1,500,000 in a new project in which EGOTH would have a majority interest. Of this credit, only 60 percent or US $900,000 would have accrued to the Claimants. This amount must be compared with the cash losses suffered by the Claimants as a result of the project\u2019s termination. Even if one considers only the Claimants\u2019 undisputed loans and capital contributions to ETDC\u2014some US $3,368,000\u2014the offer of a US $900,000 credit, which was conditioned on the Claimants\u2019 willingness to proceed as a minority shareholder with an entirely new and different project, did not, in Tribunal\u2019s view, constitute fair compensation for what was taken.\n\n163.\n\nAs to the argument that the cancellation of the project did not involve a nationalization or confiscation, it is the Respondent\u2019s contention that there was no nationalization because there was no transfer of the Claimants\u2019 rights or of the project to the State, and there was no confiscation because there was not a total deprivation of SPP\u2019s rights accompanied by an absence of compensation. The Tribunal cannot accept this contention. As the Tribunal observed in its decision of November 27, 1985:\n\n\"it is quite clear that expropriation, the legitimacy of which is not being contested, if not accompanied by fair compensation, amounts to a confiscation, which is prohibited by Law No. 43.\" (para. 69.)\n\n164.\n\nNor can the Tribunal accept the argument that the term \"expropriation\" applies only to *jus in rem.* The Respondent\u2019s cancellation of the project had the effect of taking certain important rights and interests of the Claimants. What was expropriated was not the land nor the right of usufruct, but the rights that SPP(ME), as a shareholder of ETDC, derived from EGOTH\u2019S right of usufruct, which had been \"irrevocably\" transferred to ETDC by the State. Clearly, those rights and interests were of a contractual rather than *in rem* nature. However, there is considerable authority for the proposition that contract rights are entitled to the protection of international law and that the taking of such rights involves an obligation to make compensation therefore.\n\n165.\n\nMoreover, it has been long been recognized that contractual rights may be indirectly expropriated. In the judgment of the Permanent Court of international justice concerning *Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia,* the Court ruled that, by taking possession of a factory, Poland had also \"expropriated the contractual rights\" of the operating company. *(P.C.I.J., Series A,* No. 7, 1926, at p. 44.)\n\n166.\n\nDecisions of international claims tribunals have been to the same effect. Thus, in the *Amoco Int\u2019l Finance Corp v Iran* case (15 *Iran-US CTR,* p. 89), the Iran-US Claims Tribunal said:\n\n\"Expropriation, which can be defined as a compulsory transfer of property rights, may extend to any right which can be the object of a commercial transaction....\" (para. 108.)\n\n167.\n\nAnd in the *Phillips Petroleum Co Iran v Iran* case (21 *Iran-US CTR,* p. 79) the Iran-US Claims Tribunal held that expropriation gives rise to liability for compensation\n\n\"whether the expropriation is formal or de facto and whether the property is tangible, such as real estate or a factory, or intangible, such as the contractual rights involved in the present Case.\" (para. 76.)\n\n168.\n\nIt follows that the duty to compensate in the event of expropriation cannot be evaded by contending that municipal regulations give a narrow meaning to the term \"expropriation\" or apply the concept only to certain kinds of property.\n\n169.\n\nAs to the argument that the Ras El Hekma Project was not included in the cancellation, this contention is not realistic. The *affectio societatis,* which is the essential basis of any joint venture, had disappeared in the relations between EGOTH and SPP(ME) as a result of the measures taken by the Respondent with respect to the Pyramids Oasis Project. In particular, the withdrawal of EGOTH\u2019s contribution to the joint venture with respect to the Plateau, the blocking by the Central Bank of ETDC accounts, the placing of ETDC injudicial receivership at the request of EGOTH, and the sequestration of ETDC\u2019s assets rendered impossible and impracticable the continuation of a joint venture between EGOTH and SPP(ME) with respect to Ras El Hekma.\n\n170.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is no answer to say that the Claimants could have proceeded to develop the Ras El Hekma site or a substitute site in the vicinity of the Sixth of October City. In the first place, the Ras El Hekma Project clearly was affected by the cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis Project. Among the obligations assumed by the Respondent in the Heads of Agreement was the obligation to form (through EGOTH) and support the joint venture company that would develop both the Pyramids and Ras El Hekma sites. That joint venture company\u2014ETDC\u2014was in effect dissolved as a result of the Respondent\u2019s acts. It therefore could not have developed the Ras El Hekma site, even though the Ras El Hekma Project was never formally cancelled in the sense that the Pyramids Oasis Project was.\n\n171.\n\nMoreover, even if ETDC had somehow been resurrected, as a matter of commercial and financial reality it is extremely doubtful that ETDC would have been able to attract the capital necessary for the Ras El Hekma project. The evidence shows that the Parties considered Ras El Hekma to be of secondary importance to the overall development plan. The Pyramids Oasis Project received most of the investment and publicity. ETDC\u2019s ability to attract capital for that project was due in large part to the enthusiastic endorsement of the project by the Egyptian Government. When that same Government subsequently cancelled the project\u2014the primary part of the development plan envisioned by the Parties\u2019 agreements\u2014it clearly impaired ETDC\u2019s ability to go back to the world\u2019s capital markets and raise financing for another project in Egypt-\n\n172.\n\nFinally, as to the substitute site at the Sixth of October City, the Claimants\u2019 witnesses gave convincing testimony that the site was totally unsuitable for tourist development. In any event, it is clear that the Parties\u2019 agreements provided for development of the Pyramids site, not a substitute site. The Claimants made a substantial investment pursuant to those agreements, and the investment was in effect expropriated as a result of the Respondent\u2019s cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis Project. Furthermore, the same commercial and financial considerations which suggest that financing could not have been raised for the Ras El Hekma site after the cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis Project apply to development at the Sixth of October City site. While the Claimants may have been under an obligation to mitigate the damages incurred as a result of the cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis Project, such an obligation is not so broad and all encompassing as to require the Claimants to accept an unsuitable alternative site that was never contemplated by the Parties\u2019 agreement.\n\n173.\n\nAs to any residuary rights with respect to Ras El Hekma in favour of the Claimants as shareholders in ETDC, the Claimants advised the Tribunal in a communication dated July 9, 1991 that\n\n\"they seek in these proceedings indemnification for the totality of SPP(ME)\u2019s investment in ETDC which includes its entire shareholding interest in ETDC. Upon the award of such indemnification by the arbitral tribunal, and the actual payment of such award by the ARE, Respondent would be entitled to a release from any further investment claims (including if requested a release or transfer of shareholdings in ETDC)....\"\n\nFor its part, the Respondent, in a communication dated September 20, 1991, commenting on the Claimants\u2019 communication of July 9, 1991 stated:\n\n\"Tr\u00e8s subsidiairement, la RAE rappelle que, si par impossible le Tribunal accueillait en tout ou partie les demandes d\u2019indemnisation des demanderesses ou de l\u2019une d\u2019entre elles, il lui plairait constater la renonciation (release) par SPP et/ou SPP (ME), exprim\u00e9e dans la lettre du 9 juillet 1991, \u00e0 tous leurs droits d\u00e9coulant des contrats relatifs au projet \u00e9gyptien, et sp\u00e9cialement aux droits d\u2019actionnaires dans ETDC.\"\n\nIn light of this exchange, the Tribunal has decided that, upon payment of the compensation fixed in this Award, the Respondent shall be released from any further investment claims concerning the Egyptian project as a whole and the Claimants\u2019 shareholding in ETDC shall be transferred to the Respondent. *The Mutability of Administrative Contracts*\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants were required to accept the Sixth of October City site as a modification of the contract because the contract under Egyptian law belonged to the special category of contracts known as \"administrative contracts.\" The Respondent adds that it was in the exercise of the powers concerning \"the mutability of administrative contracts in response to the requirements of public service\" that it decided to allocate to ETDC the usufruct rights over an area of six thousand feddans of land in and around the Sixth of October City, in compensation for the usufruct rights which had been granted to ETDC on the Pyramids Plateau. The Respondent contends that it was the Claimants\u2019 refusal to accept this modification of the contract that made them responsible for the total failure of the project.\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimants answer to this argument is that the alternative site proposed by the Respondent was entirely unsuitable for a tourist destination project, and that they were therefore justified in refusing to proceed with a project on the alternative site.\n\n176.\n\nIn the *Aminoil v Kuwait* case, the tribunal referred to the doctrine of administrative contracts \"as it was originally developed in French law and sub- sequently in other legal systems such as those of Egypt and Kuwait.\" *(Lloyds Arb. Rep.,* 1988, at p. 195.) The French doctrine of administrative law concerning *\"la mutabilit\u00e9 des contrats administratifs\"* authorizes the public administration to introduce unilateral modifications to an administrative contract or concession or even put an end to it provided that certain conditions are fulfilled. The first such condition is that the modification be made in the public ' interest and concern what is called in France a *\"service public;\"* the second condition is that the modification be accompanied by adequate compensation designed to preserve what is described as *\"l\u2019\u00e9quilibre financier du contrat.\"*\n\n177.\n\nThe conditions upon which the State may modify or terminate an administrative contract were described by the tribunal in the *Aminoil* case as follows:\n\n\"(i) The public authority can require a variation in the extent of the other party\u2019s liabilities (services, payments) under the contract. This must not however go so far as to distort (unbalance) the contract; and the State can never modify the financial clauses of the contract\u2014nor, in particular, disturb the general equilibrium of the rights and obligations of the parties that constitute what is sometimes known as the contract\u2019s \"financial equation\"...\n\n(ii) The public authority may proceed to a more radical step in regard ; to the contract, namely to put an end to it when essential necessities concerning the functioning of the state (operation of public services) are involved....\" (op.cit., at pp. 195-96.)\n\n178.\n\nThe change of the project\u2019s site from the Pyramids Plateau to the vicinity of the Sixth of October City would have involved much more than a mere variation of the Claimants\u2019 obligations under the contract. As already explained, it would have fundamentally changed the Parties\u2019 bargain and the underlying financial assumptions. The Respondent\u2019s argument that the Claimants were required to accept an alternative site as a modification of the Parties\u2019 contract must therefore be rejected.\n\n*The Quantum of Compensation*\n-----------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Tribunal having determined that the cancellation of the project was compensable, there remains the question of the measure of compensation. The Claimants have put forward three alternative claims for compensation. First, they claim the following amounts (\"the primary claim\") as the value of their investment in ETDC at the time the project was cancelled:\n\n(1) the value of the investment in ETDC computed at US $41,000,000, or such other sum as the Tribunal may award, on the basis of (i) the DCF methodology and/or (ii) the share sales to the Saudi Princes; and\n\n(2) the amount of the loan to ETDC, amounting to US $1,650,000; and\n\n(3) post-cancellation costs for 1978 and 1979, amounting to US $623,000; and\n\n(4) post-cancellation, legal, audit and arbitration costs from 1980 to 1990, amounting to US $5,108,000;\n\ntogether with interest to August 31, 1990\n\n(a) on the value of the investment ((1) herein) at 12.6 percent compounded annually, amounting (on a value of US $41,000,000) to US $125,000,000; and\n\n(b) on (3) herein at 12.6 percent compounded annually, amounting to US $1,874,000; and\n\n(c) on the loan to ETDC ((2) herein) at the contractual rate, amounting to US $6,931,000,\n\nplus further interest to the date of the Award.\n\n180.\n\nAlternatively and subsidiarily, the Claimants submit that they should be awarded the following compensation (\"the alternative claim\") for the value of their investment in ETDC at the time the project was cancelled:\n\n(1) the amount of the loans to ETDC, amounting to US $1,650,000; and\n\n(2) further monies lent at no interest to ETDC, amounting to US $408,000; and\n\n(3) the capital invested, amounting to US $1,310,000; and\n\n(4) development costs pre-cancellation, amounting to US $2,254,000; and\n\n(5) post-cancellation costs for 1978 and 1979, amounting to US $623,000; and\n\n(6) post-cancellation legal, audit and arbitration costs from 1980 to 1990, amounting to US $5,108,000; and\n\n(7) such additional amount as shall be fixed by the Tribunal to compensate for the loss of the chance or opportunity of making a commercial success of the project;\n\ntogether with interest to August 31, 1990\n\na. on the loan to ETDC ((1) herein) at the contractual rate, amounting to US $6,931,000; and\n\nb. on (3) herein at 12.6 percent, compounded annually, amounting to US $4,303,000; and\n\nc. on (4) herein at 12.6 percent, compounded annually, amounting to US $7,404,000; and\n\nd. on (5) herein at 12.6 percent, compounded annually, amounting to US $1,874,000,\n\nplus further interest to the date of the Award.\n\n181.\n\nAs a further alternative and subsidiary claim, the Claimants claim only their out-of-pocket expenses (\"the further subsidiary claim\"). This further subsidiary claim is identical to their alternative claim except that it does not request compensation for the loss of the opportunity to make a commercial success of the project.\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimants have acknowledged that they do not challenge the Respondent\u2019s right to cancel the project. In the Reply they state that:\n\n\"SPP(ME) from the outset sought not to challenge the ARE\u2019s acts as wrongful or void, but sought compensation rather than physical restoration of its rights....\"\n\nWhile the Claimants maintain that they are entitled to compensation for the \"repudiation and taking\" of their contract rights, they do not claim damages for breach of contract. Rather, they characterize their claim as follows:\n\n\"the claim here by SPP(ME) is not against the ARE for damages for breach of contract. It is for compensation on account of the losses occasioned to it by the ARE\u2019s exercise of its sovereign powers, which destroyed its property rights (including its contract rights).\"\n\n183.\n\nThus, the Claimants are seeking \"compensation\" for a lawful expropriation, and not \"reparation\" for an injury caused by an illegal act such as a breach of contract. The cardinal point to be borne in mind, then, in determining the appropriate compensation is that, while the contracts could no longer be performed, the Claimants are entitled to receive fair compensation for what was expropriated rather than damages for breach of contract.\n\n(i) The *DCF Approach*\n----------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the measure of compensation for the taking of an ongoing enterprise should be equal to the value of the enterprise at the time of taking, and that such value depends on the revenues that the enterprise would have generated had the taking not occurred. In quantifying this value, the Claimants rely primarily on the so-called \"discounted cash flow\" (\"DCF\") method. This method is intended to determine the present value of the future earnings expected to be generated by an investment. In applying the DCF method, the Claimants have first estimated the net revenues that would have been earned over the initial eighteen-year period of development, and then discounted that revenue flow to a present value, which, according to the Claimants, represents the value of SPP(ME)\u2019s rights as of May 28, 1978\u2014the date when the project was cancelled.\n\n185.\n\nTo project revenues into the future, the Claimants use the actual lot sales made during the project\u2019s lifetime. On this basis, they estimate that the project would have generated total net profits after tax of US $312,200,000 over the first eighteen years. Using a 20 percent discount rate, the Claimants then discount the net profits figure to a present value of US $80,100,000, which, the Claimants say, is the present value of the projected total net profits after tax for the first eighteen years of the project. This figure is then adjusted downward to US $68,500,000 to reflect ETDC\u2019s other recorded assets and liabilities. Since SPP(ME)\u2019s share of ETDC was 60 percent, the Claimants claim 60 percent of US $68,500,000 or US $41,000,000 as the value of SPP(ME)\u2019s equity in ETDC at the time that the project was terminated.\n\n186.\n\nThe Respondent contests the applicability of the DCF method on the grounds that it leads to speculative results and takes no account of the real value of the expropriated assets. In particular, the Respondent contends that in the present case the project was not sufficiently developed to yield the data necessary for a meaningful DCF analysis.\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent has also submitted an expert opinion to the effect that the DCF method of valuation is unsuitable in this case because of the inherent uncertainties of the project and the fragility of a calculation which depends on forecasting cash flows almost twenty years into the future on the basis of revenues generated over a period of little more than a year. The Respondent has also cited the earlier ICC award in this case, where the tribunal refused to apply the DCF method on the ground that when the project was cancelled \"the great majority of the work had still to be done.\" Finally, the Respondent argues that the DCF method would lead to unjust enrichment of the Claimants.\n\n188.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the DCF method is not appropriate for determining the fair compensation in this case because the project was not in existence for a sufficient period of time to generate the data necessary for a meaningful DCF calculation. At the time the project was cancelled, only 386 lots\u2014or about 6 percent of the total\u2014had been sold. All of the other lot sales underlying the revenue projections in the Claimants\u2019 DCF calculations are hypothetical. The project was in its infancy and there is very little history on which to base projected revenues.\n\n189.\n\nIn these circumstances, the application of the DCF method would, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, result in awarding \"possible but contingent and undeterminate damage which, in accordance with the jurisprudence of arbitral tribunals, cannot be taken into account.\" *(Chorzow Factory case,*Series A, No. 17, 1928, at p. 51). As the tribunal in the *Amoco* case observed:\n\n\"One of the best settled rules of the law on international responsibility of States is that no reparation for speculative or uncertain damage can be awarded.\" (op. cit., para. 238.)\n\n190.\n\nQuite apart from the inadequacy of the underlying data, there is a second reason why the Claimants\u2019 DCF approach must be rejected in the present case: the Claimants\u2019 DCF approach would in effect award *lucrum cessans* through the year 1995 on the assumption that lot sales would have continued through that year. Yet lot sales in the areas registered with the World Heritage Committee under the UNESCO Convention would have been illegal under both international law and Egyptian law after 1979, when the registration was made. Obviously, the allowance of *lucrum cessans* may only involve those profits which are legitimate. As A. de Laubad\u00e8re has stated:\n\n\"le *lucrum cessans* correspond au *\"b\u00e9n\u00e9fice l\u00e9gitime\"* que le co-contractant pouvait normalement escompter.\" (Trait\u00e9 des Contrats Administratifs, T.H, Paris, 1984, at pp. 556 and 1327.) (Emphasis added.)\n\n191.\n\nThus, even if the Tribunal were disposed to accept the validity of the Claimants\u2019 DCF calculations, it could only award *lucrum cessans* until 1979, when the obligations resulting from the UNESCO Convention with respect to the Pyramids Plateau became binding on the Respondent. From that dat\u00e9 forward, the Claimants\u2019 activities on the Pyramids Plateau would have been in conflict with the Convention and therefore in violation of international law, and any profits that might have resulted from such activities are consequently non-compensable.\n\n*(ii) The Share transactions*\n-----------------------------\n\n192.\n\nTo confirm the value indicated by their DCF calculations, the Claimants rely on certain transactions in SPP(ME) shares. These transactions include: (1) the sale in 1976 of 12,500 shares (25 percent of SPP(ME)) to two members of the Saudi Arabian royal family at US $700 a share; (2) an offer by *a* third member of the Saudi Arabian royal family to purchase 7,500 shares at US $850 a share; and (3) the repurchase by SPP(ME) of certain of its shares at prices ranging from US $598 per share to US $630 per share.\n\n193.\n\nWith respect to the sales at US $700 per share, the Claimants\u2019 expert pointed out that if one extrapolates the US $700 per share value over the entire 50,000 outstanding shares, the overall value for SPP(ME) at the time of the share transactions was US $35,000,000. The audited financial statements for SPP(ME) at the relevant time showed that, apart from SPP(ME)\u2019s 60 percent share of ETDC, its other assets and liabilities had a net value of a negative US $3,100,000. If the overall value of SPP(ME) was US $35,000,000 (as indicated by the purchase of 25 percent of SPP(ME)), it follows that SPP(ME)\u2019s 60 percent interest in ETDC had an imputed value of US $38,100,000. The Claimants\u2019 expert conducted similar analyses on the basis of the US $850 per share offer and the repurchase of shares by SPP(ME). These analyses indicated values for SPP(ME)\u2019s 60 percent share of ETDC ranging from US $33,000,000 to US $42,500,000.\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimants argue that these imputed values are, if anything, conservative because (1) the transactions occurred in 1976 when the project was not nearly as far along as it was in 1978 when it was cancelled; (2) the transactions involved minority shareholdings; and (3) certain of the transactions involved non-voting shares.\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 expert testified that the two purchasers of the SPP(ME) shares had undertaken substantial \"due diligence\" inquiries before making their investments and that they were advised by lawyers and economic consultants.\n\n196.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s expert, on the other hand, testified that in his opinion the share transactions were not a valid means of estimating the value of SPP(ME)\u2019s share in ETDC because\n\n\"The situation was that we had a major project which in 1976 was in the planning stage... and it seems to me that we are looking at what should properly be called venture capital. The princes were invited to put up venture capital, that is high risk capital, and to suggest that because they put up that high risk capital that represents the objective value of the enterprise at the date seems to me an exaggeration. I do not think it probable that willing purchasers at that price could have been found in those circumstances.\"\n\n197.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the purchase and sale of an asset between a willing buyer and a willing seller should, in principle, be the best indication of the value of the asset. This is certainly true in the case of a perfectly competitive market having many buyers and sellers in which there are no external controls or internal monopolistic arrangements. In the present case, however, there was a very limited number of transactions and there was no market as such for the shares that were sold. The price at which the shares were sold was privately negotiated. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not believe that the share transactions can be used to accurately measure the value of SPP(ME)\u2019s investment in ETDC.\n\n*(iii) The Fair Measure of Compensation*\n----------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal will turn now to the Claimant\u2019s alternative claim for compensation, which is essentially a claim for \"out-of-pocket\" expenses plus an amount to compensate the Claimants for what they have called \"the loss of the opportunity to make a commercial success of the project.\" There is no question that considerable amounts of time and money were spent on negotiating, planning and implementing the project. SPP(ME) made capital contributions and loans to ETDC, the amounts of which are not disputed by the Respondent. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, these amounts must be reimbursed as part of the fair compensation to which the Claimants are entitled. In addition, the evidence shows that, when the project was cancelled, construction was under way and considerable marketing activity had been carried out. Most of the detailed engineering design and specifications for the first phase of the infrastructure and golf course had been completed. A construction contract had been concluded for the infrastructure, construction had begun and lot sales had commenced. To the extent that the expenses associated with this activity have been proven, the Tribunal is of the view that reimbursement of such expenses is also part of the fair compensation to which the Claimants are entitled.\n\n199.\n\n*The Capital Contributions and Loans.* From the record it is evident that there is no dispute as to the amounts of the capital contributions and Ioans made by SPP(ME) to ETDC: the capital contributions, made in three installments, totalled US $1,310,000; and the loans consisted of a US $1,650,000 loan with interest at commercial rates and further loans bearing no interest of US $408,000.\n\n200.\n\n*Development Costs.* The Claimants submit that they are entitled to be reimbursed for pre-cancellation development costs of US $2,254,000 and postcancellation costs of US $623,000. These costs are disputed by the Respondent. After the final hearings in Paris, the Tribunal, at its meeting in London in February of 1991, reviewed the evidence relating to development costs. It determined that the evidence should be supplemented, and accordingly on February 13th, 1991 it issued a procedural order which directed *inter alia* that the Claimants produce\n\n\"a document indicating the nature, date and amount of the above-referenced development costs, including the names of the recipients of payments in excess of US $20,000 and a confirmation that these sums were legitimately and actually expended for the project and were directly connected with it. The document shall also contain an explanation of why these costs were not charged to or were not directly recovered from ETDC.\"\n\nThe procedural order also asked for the Respondent\u2019s comments on the information to be submitted by the Claimants. The Parties responded as described in paragraphs 39-40 above.\n\n201.\n\nIt cannot be disputed that development costs were incurred by the Claimants. Indeed, the expert report received from the Respondent on June 26, 1991 stated with respect to the development costs reported by the Claimants\u2019 auditors that \"it is reasonable to accept that the costs were actually incurred.\"\n\n202.\n\nThe question that arises from the information submitted by the Parties in response to the procedural order of February 13, 1991 concerns the extent to which the development costs that were allocated to SPP(ME) and not reimbursed by ETDC should be taken into account in fixing the compensation to be awarded to the Claimants. For the most part, the items in question involve the allocation of salaries and costs incurred by executives and employees of SPP such as overhead costs, travel and entertainment expenses, and costs incurred for recruiting and relocation of personnel, consultations concerning marketing and banking, and so forth. These expenses were incurred in connection with the project and in order to implement it. If the project had materialized, these expenses would not have been chargeable to ETDC because the Claimants had agreed to provide all of the technical expertise required for the design, construction, management and marketing of the project. However, because the project was cancelled, the Claimants could not recoup these expenses with future profits, and the expenses thus became irrecoverable losses. The Tribunal finds that it is reasonable and legitimate to take these losses into account in determining the fair measure of compensation in this case.\n\n203.\n\nNot all of the costs claimed have been properly documented, however. It was explained in an affidavit of SPP(ME)\u2019s former Financial Director that many documents and financial records could not be found or were destroyed by reason of the very long period which has passed since the expenses were incurred. But as the report of the Respondent\u2019s expert points out,\n\n\"the origins of this claim date from 1978 and I am surprised that in the circumstances the relevant documents have not been retained. It was foreseeable that they were likely to be required in this action.\"\n\nThis report also points out that the information filed by the Claimants in response to the Tribunal\u2019s procedural order of February 13, 1991 identified US $1,719,000 of the claimed costs by payee, but that the recipients of an additional US $1,545,000 of claimed costs were not identified. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it would not be appropriate to award development costs for which the Claimants are unable to identify the payee. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to award development costs only in the amount of US $1,719,000.\n\n204.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that the information filed by the Claimants in response to the Tribunal\u2019s procedural order contains evidence of the Claimants\u2019 corruption. Specifically, the Respondent has drawn the Tribunal\u2019s attention to a payment of US $16,000 made in May of 1975 to a former employee of the Egyptian Government. It is claimed that, while this individual was employed by the London agency of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism, he provided information concerning SPP\u2019s financial and technical capacity to the Egyptian authorities who were considering the proposed project and who ultimately approved it. After leaving the Government, this individual allegedly assisted SPP in securing agreements with Egyptian authorities relating to the Pyramids Oasis Project. The Tribunal notes, however, that the same document which shows the US $16,000 payment also shows that the total payments made by SPP to this individual after he left the Government amounted for the whole of the year 1975 to less than US $2,000 a month, a figure which does not suggest illicit payments to third parties. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent\u2019s contention that the information submitted by the Claimants in response to the Procedural Order contains evidence of the Claimants\u2019 corruption.\n\n205.\n\n*Legal, Audit and Arbitration Costs.* The Claimants seek reimbursement of US $5,108,000 of \"post cancellation legal, audit and arbitration costs from 1980 to 1990.\" They contend that all of the legal costs they have incurred in order to obtain compensation should be indemnified, including the legal costs resulting from the ICC arbitration and related court proceedings. They argue that all of the legal and related disbursements should be considered as an individual whole, since they were made necessary by the Respondent\u2019s wrongful refusal to grant fair compensation. The Claimants add, as a further consideration, that a great deal of the research and preparation involved in the ICC arbitration obviated the need to undertake the same work in the ICSID proceedings.\n\n206.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent states that the claim for indemnification of costs incurred in other proceedings is absurd from a legal point of view because it infringes the sanctity of *res judicata,* the awards and judgments in the other cases having already decided the question of costs incurred in those proceedings.\n\n207.\n\nIn a case such as the present one, where the measure of compensation is determined largely on the basis of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the claimant, there is little doubt that the legal costs incurred in obtaining the indemnification must be considered as part and parcel of the compensation, in order to make whole the party who suffered the loss and had to litigate to obtain compensation. This is particularly so when, as in this case, the amount offered as compensation by the Respondent was manifestly insufficient.\n\n208.\n\nHowever, only those legal and accounting fees and expenses that were incurred for work that was relevant and useful to the present ICSID proceedings are to be included in the compensation. This Tribunal cannot award costs for work which was only relevant or useful to the proceedings before the ICC tribunal, whose decision was anulled, or proceedings before national courts to defend the validity of the ICC award or obtain its enforcement.\n\n209.\n\nIn order to separate the costs that should be allocated to the present proceedings from those that should be allocated to other proceedings, the Tribunal, in its procedural order of February 13, 1991, asked the Parties to submit\n\n\"an itemized list of the legal and accounting fees relating to the present proceedings, indicating their amount, the respective dates and the phase of the proceedings to which those fees and expenses relate.\"\n\n210.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s procedural order, the Claimants have submitted a detailed list of all payments made for legal, audit and arbitration costs in connection with the ICC proceedings, related court proceedings and the ICSID proceedings. This list includes the amount and the recipient of each payment. It shows that fees and expenses of US $4,242,000 were incurred solely in connection with the ICSID proceedings, and that further fees and expenses of US $1,701,000 were incurred in connection with the ICC arbitration and related court proceedings. However, it is evident from the information submitted by the Claimants that a substantial amount of the work product covered by the US $1,701,000 of fees and expenses, such as the factual development of the case (including the preparation of various studies, reports and affidavits), was also utilized in the ICSID proceedings. On the basis of this information, the Tribunal estimates that approximately one-half of the US $1,701,000 was spent on work product that was utilized directly in the ICSID proceedings.\n\n211.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the total costs to be reimbursed to the Claimants for legal and accounting work which has been relevant or useful to the present ICSID proceedings amounts to US $5,092,000. Undoubtedly, this is a high figure, but it is justified by the extraordinary length and complication of the proceedings in this case.\n\n212.\n\n*Loss of Commercial Opportunity.* The final element in the Claimants\u2019 alternative claim is:\n\n\"such additional amount as shall be fixed by the Tribunal to compensate for the loss of the chance or opportunity of making a commercial success of the project.\"\n\nThis element of the alternative claim is what differentiates that claim from the Claimants\u2019 further subsidiary claim, which is simply for out-of-pocket expenses. Here, it is important to note that the alternative claim\u2014like the primary claim which was based on the DCF method and the share transactions \u2014is intended to recover the *value of the Claimants\u2019 investment.* This was made clear during the oral proceedings, and is also explicitly stated in the Claimants\u2019 Final Conclusions and Prayer for Relief:\n\n\"The Claimants claim secondarily, as an alternative *... the value of its investment in ETDC* on the basis of its out-of-pocket expenses... on the view that the project would necessarily have realized, at the very least, the amount invested in it, and an additional amount... to compensate for loss of the chance or opportunity of making a commercial success of the project....\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n213.\n\nIn contrast, the Claimants\u2019 further subsidiary claim as articulated in their Final Conclusions and Prayer for Relief makes no mention of the value of the investment:\n\n\"The Claimants claim as a further, subsidiary alternative... the out-ofpocket expenses... together with interest...\"\n\nThe further subsidiary claim gives up any claim for the value of the investment and seeks only to put the Claimants back in the position they were in before they became involved with the Pyramids Oasis Project.\n\n214.\n\nDuring the final hearings on the merits, the Respondent\u2019s expert testified that in his opinion, if damages were to be awarded, the measure of damages should be the value of the Claimants\u2019 investment in ETDC as of May 1978, when the Pyramids Oasis Project was cancelled. If it were the case that the Claimants\u2019 investment in the Pyramids Oasis Project had no value\u2014or had no value greater than the Claimants\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses\u2014then the further subsidiary claim might *ex hypothesi* be the appropriate basis for compensation. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, however, it is incontestable that the Claimants\u2019 investment had a value that exceeded their out-of-pocket expenses. The record shows that between February of 1977 and May of 1978, ETDC made sales of villa sites and multi-family sites totalling US $10,211,000\u2014more than twice the Claimants\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses. Moreover, construction involving roads, water and sewage systems, reservoirs, artificial lakes and a golf course had commenced and the design work for two hotels had been completed. In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot accept that the project did not have a value in excess of the Claimants\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n215.\n\nIt remains, then, for the Tribunal to determine the amount by which the value of the Claimants\u2019 investment in ETDC exceeded their out-of-pocket expenses\u2014that part of the alternative claim which the Claimants have called the \"opportunity of making a commercial success of the project.\" This determination necessarily involves an element of subjectivism and, consequently, some uncertainty. However, it is well settled that the fact that damages cannot be assessed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss has been incurred.\n\n216.\n\nIn determining the amount by which the value of the Claimants\u2019 investment in ETDC exceeded their out-of-pocket expenses, the Tribunal will take as a starting point the lot sales actually made during the short life of the project and the revenues to be imputed to those sales. As the Tribunal has already observed, the evidence shows that during the period February 1977 to May 1978, ETDC\u2019s actual sales of villa and multi-family sites amounted to US $10,211,000. The lots involved\u2014383 villa sites and 3 multi-family sites\u2014represented only 6 percent of the villa sites and less than 1 percent of the multifamily sites with respect to which ETDC held rights. It is clear, therefore, that the remaining lots were a potential source of very substantial revenues.\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal will next consider what it took in the way of expenditures by the Claimants to generate the revenues imputed to the lot sales. The difference between these expenditures and the portion of imputed revenues corresponding to SPP(ME)\u2019s shareholding in ETDC is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the minimum measure of the value to be ascribed to the opportunity to make a commercial success of the project.\n\n218.\n\nIt is not disputed that SPP(ME) made capital contributions to ETDC of US $1,310,000, and the Tribunal has already determined that the Claimants\u2019 development costs were US $1,719,000. In addition, loans totalling US $2,058,000 were made to ETDC, but these loans will be disregarded for present purposes because they were intended to be reimbursed\u2014for the most part with interest at commercial rates. The portion of the revenues imputed to the lot sales corresponding to SPP(ME)\u2019s shareholding in ETDC was 60 percent of US $10,211,000, or US $6,127,000. Thus, the portion of the sales revenues corresponding to SPP(ME)\u2019s shareholding in ETDC would have exceeded the Claimants\u2019 non-reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses by US $3,098,000. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that the value of what the Claimants have called the \"opportunity of making a commercial success of the project\" was not less than US $3,098,000. Stated differently, the value of the Claimants\u2019 investment in May of 1978 when the project was cancelled exceeded their out-of-pocket expenses by at least US $3,098,000.\n\n219.\n\n*Interest.* The Claimants maintain that it has long been accepted under international law that appropriate compensation carries with it interest from the date of the wrong, so as to compensate the injured party for not having had the use of the money between the date when it ought to have been paid and the date of the payment. In support of this contention the Claimants invoke decisions of the Permanent Court of International Justice and various international arbitration and claims tribunals. The Claimants further assert that the rate of interest should be a reasonable one, based on the amount that a successful claimant would have been in a position to have earned if it had had the fonds available to invest. Accordingly, it claims a rate of 12.6 percent per annum, compounded annually from May 28, 1978 to the date of the Award, observing that this is the rate of interest agreed between SPP(ME) and ETDC in the loan agreement of April 15, 1976.\n\n220.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent contends that, if compensation is to be awarded, the rate of interest requested by the Claimants, as well as the modalities for its computation, should be rejected as contrary to Egyptian law in accordance with Article 42(1) of the Washington Convention. The Respondent calls attention to Article 226 of the Civil Code of Egypt, which provides for a rate of four percent for civil debts (including administrative contracts) and five percent for commercial debts, and contends that this is a civil matter, since the Heads of Agreement, concluded by a Minister of the Government, could not be qualified as a commercial act. The Respondent also points out that Article 232 of the Civil Code forbids compound interest, or interest on interest, and provides that the interest may in no event exceed the principal amount. As to the date at which interest begins to run, the Respondent contends that under Article 226 it is the date of the initiation of proceedings in case of \"liquid debts,\" so that if the amount is fixed by the award it is only from the date of the award that interest begins to run.\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimants, on the other hand, point out that the limitation in Egyptian law on the rate of interest applies only\u2014according to the terms of Article 226 of the Civil Code\u2014\"when the object of an obligation is the payment of a sum of money of which the amount is known at the time when the claim is made,\" which, they maintain, is not the case here.\n\n222.\n\nIn light of these various considerations, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that, subject to the exception discussed below (paragraphs 225-231), Article 42 (1) of the Washington Convention requires that interest be determined according to Egyptian law because there is no rule of international law that would fix the rate of interest or proscribe the limitations imposed by Egyptian law.\n\n223.\n\nWith respect to the rate of interest, the Tribunal is of the view that it should be five percent rather than four percent. The argument that the Heads of Agreement was not a commercial contract is not conclusive because the present claim is not an action for a breach of that contract, but rather one seeking compensation for the expropriation of the rights of a commercial enterprise for the development of tourism.\n\n224.\n\nThe provisions of Egyptian law which prohibit compound interest and require that the interest not exceed the principal are also applicable.\n\n225.\n\nThe provisions of Egyptian law concerning interest do not apply to the loan of US $1,650,000 from SPP(ME) to ETDC. The underlying loan agreement of April 15, 1976 by its terms is governed by English law. Clause 17 of the loan agreement provides:\n\n\"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of England.\"\n\n226.\n\nWith respect to interest, the loan agreement provides in Clause 4 that:\n\n\"During the period from the first Date of Drawdown until the final Date of Payment the Borrower shall pay interest on the Borrowing.\"\n\nand that:\n\n\"Interest shall be paid in dollars to the Lender in London or in such other foreign currency and in such other place as may mutually be agreed from time to time and shall be paid on the relevant Interest Date at the relevant Interest Rate for that Interest Period.\"\n\n227.\n\nThe term \"Interest Rate\" is defined as:\n\n\"such rate of interest from the first date of Drawdown until repayment of the Borrowing in respect of each period ending on an Interest Date as shall be two per centum above the three months offered quotation for the deposit in Dollars by prime banks to the Lender (as certified by the Lender) in the London Interbank Market at approximately 11.00 a.m. London time two Business Days before the Date of Drawdown or (as the case may be) before each relevant Interest Date.\"\n\n228.\n\nThe loan agreement also provides that the interest shall be compounded if interest payments are not made on time:\n\n\"If any interest payable hereunder is not paid by noon (London time) on the day on which the same is due then the interest so in arrears shall thenceforth itself bear interest at the relevant Interest Rate computed from the date the same became payable to the date on which it is in fact paid....\"\n\n229.\n\nThus, the loan agreement establishes a higher rate of interest than that prescribed by Egyptian law and also provides for compound interest. Moreover; the interest on this loan now amounts to US $8,134,000 and thus exceeds the principal. However, since the loan agreement is governed by the laws of England, which allow compound interest and the accrual of interest in excess of the principal, the Egyptian limitations on interest do not apply. Under the loan agreement, SPP(ME) had a contractual right against ETDC to interest at the rate fixed by the loan agreement when the project was cancelled and the Central Bank blocked the Claimants\u2019 funds. This contractual right was in effect expropriated. The Claimants do not ask the Tribunal to award interest on the principal amount as such, but rather to compensate them for the value of the contractual right taken. That value clearly includes the interest provided for in the loan agreement.\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it was not a party to the loan agreement and thus is not bound by the choice of English law. But the Claimants are not asking for damages for a breach of the loan agreement; they are seeking compensation on account of an expropriation. The credit that SPP(ME) had with respect to ETDC was expropriated by the Egyptian authorities when the Central Bank of Egypt, acting on the recommendation of the People\u2019s Assembly Committee, ordered\n\n\"the blockage of fonds, papers and documents of EGOTH and also the blockage of the foreign partner fonds and documents.\"\n\nThus, ETDC was prevented from repaying the loan and the interest that it had agreed to. Therefore, this loan is to be reimbursed to the Claimants with all of the interest stipulated in the loan agreement. This is the full and uncontestable value of the expropriated credit.\n\n231.\n\nFinally, the five percent interest rate prescribed by Egyptian law does not apply to the loans of US $408,000, since the Parties agreed that these loans would not bear interest.\n\n232.\n\nWith respect to the date from which interest shall run, the Respondent has invoked Article 226 of the Civil Code of Egypt which provides:\n\n\"When the object of an obligation is the payment of the sum of money of which the amount is known at the time when the claim is made, the debtors shall be bound, in case of delay in payment, to pay to the creditor, as damages for the delay, interest at the rate of 4% in civil matters and 5% in commercial matters. Such interest shall run from the date of the claim in Court, unless the contract or commercial usage fixes another date. This article shall apply, unless otherwise provided by law.\"\n\n233.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the *dies a quo* established in Article 226, \"the date of the claim in Court,\" only applies to \"such interest\" which is to be paid \"in case of delay of payment,\" that is, to moratory interest or interest on the award. It does not apply to compensatory interest, that is, to interest which is part of the award. Also, Article 226 refers to \"the payment of a sum of money of which the amount is known at the time when the claim is made,\" i.e., a liquidated claim. The present case involves neither moratory interest nor a liquidated claim. Consequently, no provision of the Civil Code or other legislation concerning the *dies a quo* applies to compensatory interest for a yet to be determined amount of compensation arising out of an act of expropriation.\n\n234.\n\nGiven this lacunae, it is legitimate to apply the logical and normal principle usually applied in cases of expropriation, namely, that the *dies a quo* is the date on which the dispossession effectively took place, since it is from that date that the deprivation has been suffered. This principle is supported by the doctrine and the jurisprudence of international tribunals. Moreover, many constitutions and national laws concerning expropriation require that payment be made prior to or simultaneous with the dispossession, thus supporting the *dies a quo* from the date of the taking, in this case May 28, 1978. To fix the *dies a quo* from the date of filing the claim or the date of the award, as requested by the \\ Respondent, would encourage parties who have expropriated property to refuse to pay compensation and to delay the proceedings seeking compensation.\n\n235.\n\nAs to the *dies ad quem* for the running of interest, there is no Egyptian rule that has been called to the Tribunal\u2019s attention. The prevailing jurisprudence in international arbitrations is to the effect that interest runs until the date of effective payment, and this conclusion is supported by doctrinal opinion. This conclusion also seems to result implicitly from Article 226 of the Civil Code of Egypt.\n\n236.\n\nConsequently, as requested by the Claimants, post-award interest will commence 30 days after the date on which this Award is notified to the Respondent, and will run until the date of payment. This interest shall be at the rate of five percent per annum and shall not be compounded.\n\n237.\n\n*Monetary Adjustment for Currency Devaluation.* The five percent rate of interest which the Tribunal has determined to be applicable in this case does not fully compensate the Claimants for the losses which they incurred as a consequence of being deprived of money owed them between the time when the project was cancelled and the date of this Award. The reason that the five percent rate does not make the Claimants whole is that, since the project was cancelled in 1978, there has been a significant devaluation of the the US dollar.\n\n238.\n\nDevaluation is a function of inflation. If the Tribunal had determined that a \"commercial\" rate of interest were applicable in this case, devaluation would be accounted for automatically because commercial interest rates add an adjustment for inflation to the \"real\" interest rate. The five percent rate which the Tribunal has determined to be applicable is not a commercial rate, however. The record shows that since June of 1978 rates for US dollar deposits quoted in the London Interbank Market averaged more than 12 percent. Since commercial interest rates are always higher (usually by 2-3 percentage points) than the clearing banks\u2019 base rate, it is evident that the five percent rate does not compensate the Claimants for the devaluation of the US dollar that has occurred since 1978.\n\n239.\n\nAccordingly, it is the opinion of the Tribunal that certain elements of the compensation based on the Claimants\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses should be adjusted upward to take into account the devaluation of the US dollar since 1978. This is required in order that the compensation awarded by the Tribunal give the Claimants the same purchasing power today that they would have had in 1978 with the dollars that they invested in ETDC. Such a correction is necessary if the compensation is to be fair. If it were otherwise, the Claimants would be seriously prejudiced as a consequence of the devaluation of currencies that has occurred during the period in which they have been seeking a remedy for the loss that they have sustained.\n\n240.\n\nIn making an adjustment to take account of currency devaluation, the Tribunal has followed the approach adopted by the tribunal in the *Aminoil* case, which included an eminent Egyptian jurist. There, in awarding compensation for an expropriated investment, the tribunal stated that\n\n\"the proportions assumed by world inflation must lead to appraisals that are more in line with economic realities, and the determination of an indemnification cannot be tied down to the inflexible consequences of a purely monetary designation.\" (op. cit., at p. 213.)\n\nThe tribunal further said that\n\n\"if it were thought necessary to arrive at the total figure of the capital invested by Aminoil in its undertaking it would be appropriate to do so without holding the dollars of 1977 to be equivalent to those of 1948.\" (ibid.)\n\n241.\n\nThe tribunal referred to \"the general principle of the preservation of the value of money\" (paragraph 169), and then stated:\n\n\"The Tribunal has not overlooked the fact that there may be different ways of assessing the levels of inflation.... In the compensation to be paid to Aminoil it would be natural to take account of the progress of inflation generally....\" (op. cit., at p. 214.)\n\nThe Tribunal then concluded:\n\n\"In order to establish what is due in 1982 account must be taken both of a reasonable rate of interest, which could be put at 7.5 per cent, and of a level of inflation which the Tribunal fixes at an overall rate of 10 per cent\u2014that is to say a total annual increase of 17.5 per cent in the amount due, over the amount due for the preceding year.\" (op. cit., at p. 216.)\n\n242.\n\nA monetary adjustment such as that utilized in the *Aminoil* award also finds support in Egyptian law. Decisions of the Egyptian *Cour de Cassation* and doctrinal opinions were called to the attention of the Tribunal. These opinions and decisions concluded that \"due regard should be given to the increase or decrease of the currency price.\" These decisions and authoritative opinions confirm that under Egyptian law consideration is given to changes occurring \"in the price of currency in which the compensation is to be estimated.\" (Abdel-Rezzak Ahmed El-Sanhoury, *Sources of Obligation,* Section 649, at pp. 975-6.)\n\n243.\n\nIn order to compensate the Claimants for the devaluation of the US dollar that has occurred since the Pyramids Oasis Project was cancelled in 1978, the Tribunal has adjusted certain of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Claimants. These adjustments have been made using a \"deflator factor\" derived from data published by the International Monetary Fund in *International Financial Statistics.* This factor is computed on the basis of the United States Consumer Price Index. For the period May 31, 1978 to December 31, 1991\u2014the most recent date for which the data necessary to calculate the deflator factor is available\u2014the deflator factor was 2.2074. In other words, the purchasing power of 100 U.S. dollars in May of 1978 was equivalent to the purchasing power of 220.74 U.S. dollars in December of 1991.\n\n244.\n\nAs to the elements of compensation to which the deflator factor is to be applied, the Tribunal is of the view that the invested capital of US $1,310,000, the development costs of US $1,719,000 and the interest-free loan of US $408,000 should be adjusted for monetary devaluation. No adjustment is required for the loan of US $1,650,000, since that loan carries commercial interest and thus takes account of inflation and the resulting currency devaluation. Nor, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, is adjustment of the legal, audit and arbitration expenses necessary, since the bulk of these expenses was either incurred in\u2014 or imputed to proceedings that occurred in\u2014the last several years. Finally, no adjustment of the opportunity cost element of the compensation will be made because of the nature of that particular cost and the method by which it was determined.\n\n*Mitigating Factors Invoked by the Respondent*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Respondent has drawn the Tribunal\u2019s attention to certain circumstances which, it is claimed, are mitigating factors that should be taken into account in the event that any compensation is awarded in this case. First, it is alleged that there has been no enrichment of the State, whereas there has been an enrichment of the Claimants as a result of the sale of shares to the members of the Saudi Arabian royal family.\n\n246.\n\nIt may be true that the Respondent has not benefited financially from the cancellation of the project. However, the Respondent has obtained certain non-material benefits through the preservation *of* an area constituting a world cultural heritage, thus becoming entitled to the advantages\u2014including the possibility of outside financial assistance\u2014deriving from the UNESCO Convention.\n\n247.\n\nMoreover, although unjust enrichment has on infrequent occasion been used by international tribunals as a basis for awarding compensation, it is generally accepted that the measure of compensation should reflect the claimant\u2019s loss rather than the defendant\u2019s gain. The question of whether the Respondent was enriched by the cancellation of the Pyramids Oasis Project is not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, relevant to the amount of compensation to be awarded in the present case.\n\n248.\n\nAs to the alleged enrichment of the Claimants as a result of the share transactions, the Tribunal first notes that it disregarded these transactions in fixing the amount of compensation. If the Tribunal had used the share sales to measure the value of SPP(ME)\u2019s investment in ETDC, the resulting compensation would have been considerably more than that which the Tribunal has determined to be appropriate.\n\n249.\n\nFurthermore, the record shows that the proceeds from the share transactions were intended to finance the Pyramids Oasis Project. If some of those proceeds were not ultimately invested in the project, this was presumably due to the Respondent\u2019s cancellation of the project rather than to any act attributable to the Claimants.\n\n250.\n\nThe next factor invoked by the Respondent to mitigate the amount of compensation in the present case is the fact that the reclassification of the land on the Pyramids Plateau was a lawful act. This factor, however, has already been taken into consideration in the Tribunal\u2019s decision not to award compensation based on profits that might have accrued to the Claimants after the date on which areas on the Plateau were registered with the World Heritage Committee.\n\n251.\n\nNext, the Respondent contends that the project was located in an area where the Claimants should have known there was a risk that antiquities would be discovered. Again, this is a factor that is already reflected in the method used by the Tribunal to value the Claimants\u2019 loss, and particularly in the Tribunal\u2019s decision and not to base compensation on profits that might have been earned after the Plateau areas were registered with UNESCO.\n\n252.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimants\u2019 rejection of the Sixth of October City site should be taken into account in fixing the amount of compensation to be awarded. The Tribunal cannot accept this argument. As explained above (paragraph 172), the Claimants\u2019 rejection of the substitute site was entirely justified and is therefore irrelevant to the amount of compensation to be awarded the Claimants.\n\n253.\n\nFinally, the Respondent maintains that certain dangerous events which occurred in Egypt after 1978, adversely affecting tourism there, should be taken into account in fixing the amount of compensation. These events are also irrelevant, because the Tribunal has excluded any profits which might have been earned after 1978 from the compensation that it has determined to be appropriate.\n\n*The Counter-Claim*\n-------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent has formally requested the Tribunal to:\n\n\"Dire et juger que SPP, et subsidiairement SPP (ME) sont responsables \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la R.A.E. de la non-r\u00e9alisation des projets, et qu\u2019elles devront payer une somme forfaitaire de 30 millions de USD \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice, incluant les frais de proc\u00e9dure.\"\n\n255.\n\nIn support of the Counter-Claim, the Respondent invokes certain faults alleged to be attributable to the Claimants, namely:\n\ni) the transformation of the project into a housing project;\n\nii) the absence of touristic elements (hotels, commercial centers and villages) in the project;\n\niii) the Claimants\u2019 abandonment of the Ras El Hekma Project;\n\niv) the financial deficiencies of the Claimants; and\n\nv) above all, the Claimants\u2019 refusal to cooperate, and particularly to consider the solution of an alternative site.\n\n256.\n\nIt results from what the Tribunal has already said that none of these alleged faults was committed and none of them was imputed to the Claimants by the Egyptian authorities as a ground for the cancellation or in any other form before May 28, 1978. It follows that the Counter-Claim is to be dismissed.\n\nIV.
