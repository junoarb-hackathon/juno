INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn February 17, 2017, the Respondent submitted its Notice of Intended Preliminary Objection and Request for Bifurcation (the \"**Bifurcation Request**\"). The Respondent also requested that, pending resolution of the Bifurcation Request, the existing pleading schedule be suspended.\n\n2.\n\nOn February 20, 2017, the Tribunal invited the Claimants (or the \"**Ballantines**\") to submit any comments they may have on the Bifurcation Request by March 6, 2017.\n\n3.\n\nOn March 6, 2017, the Claimants submitted their Response to the Bifurcation Request (the \"**Response on Bifurcation**\") objecting to the same.\n\n4.\n\nOn March 7, 2017, the Respondent requested leave of Tribunal to submit a brief reply (of no more than five pages) by March 8, 2017.\n\n5.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Respondent may submit a brief reply of no more than five pages by March 8, 2017, and that the Claimants may, if they so wish, submit a brief sur-reply, also limited to five pages, by March 10, 2017.\n\n6.\n\nOn March 8, 2017, the Respondent submitted its reply (the \"**Reply on Bifurcation**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn March 10, 2017, the Claimants submitted their sur-reply (the \"**Sur-reply on Bifurcation**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Respondent's request to suspend the existing pleading schedule pending resolution of the Bifurcation Request was denied.\n\n**II. RESPONDENT'S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent submits that its consent to arbitration under CAFTA-DR does not cover the Claimants' claims given that their dominant and effective nationality was Dominican both at the time of the alleged CAFTA-DR violations (which the Respondent identifies as November 30, 2010) and at the time of submission of their claims to arbitration (September 11, 2014), the two dates the Respondent identifies as critical.1 Therefore: (i) the Ballantines are not \"claimants\" under CAFTA-DR;2 and (ii) their claims do not involve any obligations under Section A of CAFTA-DR (*i.e.*, Arts. 10.1 to 10.14), as required by Art. 10.16.1 thereof3 (the \"**Objection**\").\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 1; Reply on Bifurcation, p. 5.\n\nBifurcation Request, section B.\n\nBifurcation Request, section C.\n\n10.\n\nOn their part, in sum, the Claimants submit that their dominant and effective nationality is and has always been American, that the Claimants acquired the Dominican nationality simply to promote their investment in the Dominican Republic and minimize market discrimination, and that they were considered Americans by the Respondent.4 In addition, the Claimants disagree with the Respondent on the moments the latter has identified as critical to assess the dominant and effective nationality of an investor under CAFTA-DR, which the Claimants consider to be those when they made their investment in the Dominican Republic.5\n\nResponse on Bifurcation, paras. 4-8.\n\nResponse on Bifurcation, para. 19.\n\n**III. PARTIES' POSITIONS ON BIFURCATION**\n------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the current procedural calendar be suspended and that its Objection be decided as a preliminary question. The Respondent bases its request for bifurcation on the following arguments:\n\na) Taking into consideration the three factors identified in *Glamis Gold Ltd. v. USA*, the Respondent submits that all of them favor bifurcation6: (i) the Objection, which goes to the Respondent's consent to this arbitration, is substantial and requires the Tribunal's careful review; (ii) should the Respondent prevail in either aspect of its Objection, this would dispose of the entire case; and (iii) the Objection is not intertwined with the merits.7\n\nb) Additionally, the Respondent submits that bifurcation would not result in any material harm or prejudice to the Claimants.8\n\nc) Furthermore, the Respondent submits that \"considerations of procedural economy and fairness dictate that the Dominican Republic should not be forced to undergo an onerous and expensive proceeding on the merits unless and until the Tribunal has made a determination on the [Objection]\".9\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 37 *referring to Glamis Gold Ltd v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL 1976, Procedural Order No. 2 (Revised) dated May 31, 2005 (\"**Glamis Gold**\").\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 38; Reply on Bifurcation, pp. 3-4.\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 39.\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 41.\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants, on their part, request that the Tribunal deny the Bifurcation Request and the Respondent's Objection, and proceed with the current arbitration schedule, or alternatively, delay any decision on bifurcation until after the Respondent has submitted its Statement of Defense on May 4, 2017.10 In support of their position, the Claimants submit that (i) Article 23.3 of the UNCITRAL Rules does not contain a presumption in favor of bifurcation;11 (ii) bifurcation in this case would entail delay and unnecessary costs for both Parties;12 (iii) the Objection is at the heart of the merits of the case and inextricably linked to the merits;13 (iv) the Objection is not substantial, as \"a 'substantial' dual nationality objection would be one where the claimant was committing fraud with respect to the nationality or attempting to inappropriately gain some international advantage\";14 and (v) the Claimants deserve a relatively speedy resolution of their claims, and investor-State proceedings are already lengthy and cumbersome.15\n\nResponse on Bifurcation, para. 9 and section V.\n\nSur-reply on Bifurcation, p. 1.\n\nResponse on Bifurcation, paras. 52-53; Sur-reply on Bifurcation, p. 2.\n\nResponse on Bifurcation, paras. 54-56; Sur-reply on Bifurcation, pp. 2-3.\n\nSur-reply on Bifurcation, p. 4.\n\nResponse on Bifurcation, para. 57.\n\n**IV. RELEVANT PROVISIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n13.\n\nArticle 10.20.4 of the CAFTA-DR provides:\n\n*4. Without prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.*\n\n14.\n\nArticle 17.1 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\n*1. Subject to these Rules, the arbitral tribunal may conduct the arbitration in such manner as it considers appropriate, provided that the parties are treated with equality and that at an appropriate stage of the proceedings each party is given a reasonable opportunity of presenting its case. The arbitral tribunal, in exercising its discretion, shall conduct the proceedings so as to avoid unnecessary delay and expense and to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving the parties' dispute.*\n\n15.\n\nArticle 23.3 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\n*3. The arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea* [that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction] *either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits. The arbitral tribunal may continue the arbitral proceedings and make an award, notwithstanding any pending challenge to its jurisdiction before a court.*\n\n**V. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------\n\n16.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal confirms that at this stage of the proceedings, its only task is to determine whether to bifurcate, not to decide on the merits of the Objection.\n\n17.\n\nArticles 17.1 and 23.3 of the UNCITRAL Rules give discretion to the Tribunal to decide jurisdictional objections as preliminary questions or decide them together with the merits. The Tribunal notes that neither Party disputes this authority of the Tribunal.16 As to Article 10.20.4 of the CAFTA-DR, the Respondent has confirmed that its Bifurcation Request is made pursuant the initial part of this provision on the \"tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question\".17\n\nReply on Bifurcation, p. 2; Sur-reply on Bifurcation, p. 1.\n\nReply on Bifurcation, p. 1.\n\n18.\n\nFor the Tribunal's analysis, the starting point is the text of Article 17.1 of the UNICITRAL Rules, which states that in the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal \"shall conduct the proceedings so as to avoid unnecessary delay and expense and to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving the parties' dispute\". In addition, the Tribunal draws guidance from the standard set out in *Glamis Gold*, cited by both Parties,18 according to which the following elements should be taken into consideration to decide whether or not to grant the Bifurcation Request: (i) whether the request is substantial or frivolous; (ii) whether the request, if granted, would result in a material reduction of the proceedings at the next phase; and (iii) whether the issues are too intertwined with the merits that bifurcation is impractical because it is unlikely that there will be any savings in time or cost.19\n\n*See* Bifurcation Request, para. 37; Reply on Bifurcation, p. 3; Sur-reply on Bifurcation, pp. 1-2.\n\n*Glamis Gold*, para. 12:  \n\"12. This Tribunal in examining the various sources finds that Article 21(4) contains a three fold test:  \na. First, in considering a request for the preliminary consideration of an objection to jurisdiction, the tribunals should take the claim as it is alleged by Claimant.  \nb. Second, the \"plea\" must be one that goes to the \"jurisdiction\" of the tribunal over the claim [...].  \nc. Third, if an objection is raised to the jurisdiction of the tribunal and a request is made by either party that the objection be considered as a preliminary matter, the tribunal should do so. The tribunal may decline to do so when doing so is unlikely to bring about increased efficiency in the proceedings. Considerations relevant to this analysis include, inter alia, (1) whether the objection is substantial inasmuch as the preliminary consideration of a frivolous objection to jurisdiction is very unlikely to reduce the costs of, or time required for, the proceeding; (2) whether the objection to jurisdiction if granted results in a material reduction of the proceedings at the next phase (in other words, the tribunal should consider whether the costs and time required of a preliminary proceedings, even if the objecting party is successful, will be justified in terms of the reduction in costs at the subsequent phase of proceedings); and (3) whether bifurcation is impractical in that the jurisdictional issue identified is so intertwined with the merits that it is very unlikely that there will be any savings in time or cost.\"\n\n19.\n\nWith respect to the first element, without addressing the merits of the Objection, the Tribunal observes that it is undisputed between the Parties that the Claimants were citizens both of the United States of America and of the Dominican Republic since 2010, including when they filed their claim for arbitration as well as when at least some of the alleged violations of the CAFTA-DR occurred.20 The Claimants allege that they started investing in the Dominican Republic before they acquired their Dominican citizenship, with purchase of lands made as early as July 200421.\n\nClaimants' Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration dated June 12, 2014, para. 17: \"...in 2010, Michael and Lisa Ballantine became dual citizens of the United States and the Dominican Republic...\"; Claimants' Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated September 11, 2014, para. 21: \"...the Ballantines became citizens of the Dominican Republic only in 2010...\"; Claimants' Amended Statement of Claim dated January 4, 2017, paras. 155-156: \"[the Ballantines] became citizens of the Dominican Republic in 2010... [i]n September 2016, The [sic] Ballantines began taking steps to renounce their Dominican citizenship...\"; Bifurcation Request, paras. 1, 11 and 18-19: \"[t]he naturalization process began in September 2009... [t]he applications were approved by presidential decree on 30 December 2009...\"; Response on Bifurcation, paras. 4 and 26.\n\nResponse on Bifurcation, para. 31.\n\n20.\n\nAs to the second element of the *Glamis Gold* standard, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent alleges that, if successful, its Objection would dispose of the entire case, and that the Claimants do not take issue with this statement. The Tribunal agrees that should it find that the Claimants' \"dominant and effective nationality\" at relevant times was Dominican, the Objection would dispose of the entire case.\n\n21.\n\nTherefore, in the Tribunal's view, a valid question arises under Article 10.28 of the CAFTA-DR concerning the definition of \"investor\" protected under the CAFTA-DR, as to which was the Claimants' \"dominant and effective nationality\" at relevant times. The Tribunal is thus unpersuaded by the Claimants' argument that the Respondent's Objection is not substantial.\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal would like to note that the factual circumstances that this case presents are unique. The Tribunal is mindful that nationality-based challenges to the question of whether the claimants are qualified investors are most often brought in situations where the claimants have adopted nationality to gain access to treaty protections.22 Other cases have involved investors who obtain residence of the host country23 or investors who have assigned theirs claims to an entity owned and controlled by an entity of the host State.24 As to the specific question before this Tribunal, of determining the \"dominant and effective nationality\", the Parties agree that the CAFTA-DR does not articulate any standard for its determination and agree that reference to international law is appropriate.25 The Respondent further states that it \"is not aware of any investor-State tribunal that has addressed this issue\".26 The Tribunal notes that this appears thus to be a question of first impression where a provision which addresses this standard would have to be interpreted in the investor-State -investment treaty- context.\n\n*See, e.g.* *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/17, Award dated January 9, 2015, para. 191; *Philip Morris Asia Limited (Hong Kong) v. The Commonwealth of Australia*, PCA Case No. 2012-02, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated December 17, 2015, paras. 554 and 584; *Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People's Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Decision on Jurisdiction dated February 21, 2014, para. 70.\n\n*See e.g.* *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Interim Decision on Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues dated December 6, 2000, paras. 28, 30, 36-37.\n\n*See e.g. The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Decision on hearing of Respondent's objection to competence and jurisdiction dated January 5, 2001, para. 32(v). *See also The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award dated June 26, 2003, Orders, numeral 1.\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 12; Response on Bifurcation, para. 22.\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 12.\n\n23.\n\nLastly, it is with respect to the third element of the *Glamis Gold* standard (*i.e.*, whether the issues are too intertwined with the merits that bifurcation is impractical because it is unlikely that there will be any savings in time or cost) that the Tribunal faces more difficulty.\n\n24.\n\nIn order to resolve the Objection, the Tribunal will be called upon to interpret the definition of \"investor of a Party\" in accordance with the customary international rules of interpretation in their context and in light of the object and purpose of the CAFTA-DR. Article 10.28 of the CAFTA-DR states:\n\n***investor** **of a Party** means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party; provided, however, that **a natural person** who is a dual national shall be deemed to be **exclusively** a national of the State of **his or her dominant and effective nationality** ;* [emphasis added]\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it is clear from the text of this provision that the CAFTA-DR allows an \"investor of a Party\" to have dual nationality. Thus, the Tribunal opines that the key question before it is to ascertain the meaning of the words \"dominant and effective\" in determining the nationality of the Claimants in the context of the CAFTA-DR. The Tribunal considers that the elements analyzed by other tribunals (even if not involved in interpreting investment treaty provisions) will certainly be relevant to the Tribunal's analysis, including, among others, the State of habitual residence, the circumstances in which the second nationality was acquired, the individual's personal attachment for a particular country, and the center of the person's economic, social and family life.27\n\nBifurcation Request, para. 12 and Reply on Bifurcation, p. 4 *referring to Lichtenstein v. Guatemala (Nottebohm Case - second phase),* International Court of Justice, Judgment dated April 6, 1955, p. 22 (**RL-6**); *United States v. Italy (Merg\u00e9 Case)*, It.-U.S. Conciliation Commission, Decision dated June 10, 1955, p. 247 (**RL-7**); Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, Case No. A/18, Decision dated April 6, 1984, p. 12 (**RL-8**).\n\n26.\n\nHowever, the interpretation of the terms \"dominant and effective nationality\" in this instance will primarily have to involve the immediate context. Given the timing of the Ballantines' acquisition of Dominican nationality and their asserted reasons for acquiring that nationality, the Tribunal is of the view that the facts surrounding the investment made by the Ballantines, as well as the conduct of the host State *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Ballantines, and vice versa, will need to be examined for purposes of determining the dominant and effective nationality of the Ballantines. There is nothing in the language of the CAFTA-DR that precludes the Tribunal from considering facts surrounding the investment when examining whether there is a qualified investor thereunder. The definition of \"investor of a Party\", which refers to a national of a Party that \"has made an investment in the territory of another Party\", provides further contextual support for such an approach.\n\n27.\n\nMoreover, the evidence concerning the facts previous to the date of filing for arbitration (*i.e.*, September 11, 2014) would certainly have some bearing in the Tribunal's assessment of both whether the Ballantines *had a dominant and effective Dominican nationality* and whether there was discrimination between the Claimants -as *investor of a Party-* and Dominican nationals -as nationals of the host State.\n\n28.\n\nDue to the particular circumstances of the dispute at hand, where the timing of when the Ballantines acquired Dominican citizenship overlaps with the period in which the alleged unfair or discriminatory treatment occurred, as well as the various factors that the Tribunal may have to take into consideration in order to determine the dominant and effective nationality, the majority of the Tribunal is persuaded that, in the circumstances of the present case, the facts concerning the Objection appear to be intertwined with those concerning the merits, which would justify hearing them together.\n\n29.\n\nWith the foregoing, the Tribunal is not suggesting that an alleged violation of the CAFTA-DR could in any way inform the Objection related to the \"dominant and effective nationality\" analysis. The jurisdictional question presents a discrete issue different from the merits. The issue here is rather that the same facts would necessarily have a bearing or would be relevant for both the procedural and the substantive determination.\n\n30.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the majority of the Tribunal considers that in light of the factual link between the merits and the Objection, a separate process would create unnecessary delays in these proceedings. Thus, with a view of conducting an efficient process, the Tribunal, by majority, denies the Respondent's Bifurcation Request. The Tribunal finally notes that the ultimate outcome of the Objection will be a factor that the Tribunal may take into account when awarding costs in this dispute.\n\n**VI. TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n---------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, hereby rejects, by majority, the Respondent's Bifurcation Request and confirms that the proceedings shall continue in accordance with the procedural calendar set forth in Annex 1 of Procedural Order No. 1."}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2019-09-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Partial Dissent by Prof. Vinuesa on Costs", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Partial Dissent by Prof. Vinuesa on Costs\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nWhile fully agreeing with the decision on the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction in this matter, I regret being unable to share the grounds justifying the majority's decision on the allocation of the costs of the proceedings before the PCA, and of the Tribunal's fees and expenses, for the following reasons.\n\n2.\n\nThe applicable law for determining who should bear the legal costs and fees is set forth in DR-CAFTA as well as in the applicable arbitration rules, *i.e.* the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n3.\n\nUnder these provisions established by different instruments, the Tribunal must, given that there is no order of priority between them, interpret and apply these provisions privileging their compatibility.\n\n4.\n\nThe guiding criterion, both in DR-CAFTA1 and in the UNCITRAL Rules,2 is related to the principle of \"the unsuccessful party pays\". The applicable law grants the Tribunal broad discretional power to adjust the application of this principle by considering the particular circumstances of the case to reach a reasonable result. Therefore, this broad discretional power is not absolute, but rather it must be exercised pursuant to the parameters established under the applicable law.\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.20.6 (\"When it decides a respondent's objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant's claim or the respondent's objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.\")\n\nUNCITRAL Rules, Article 42(1) (\"The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case\").\n\n5.\n\nAfter stating that the tribunal may, if warranted, grant the unsuccessful party court costs and fees, DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 goes on to say the tribunal should likewise consider whether the Claimant's claim is frivolous in nature. If the tribunal finds the claim is not frivolous, it should then assess the circumstances of the case in order to adopt a reasonable criterion as regards the apportioning of the costs. DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 does not exclude the tribunal's power to justify the reasonability of its decision based on the particular circumstances of the case, under Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n6.\n\nUnder applicable law it is not possible to confuse the frivolity assessment of a \"claim\" with the necessary consideration of the particular circumstances of each case to arrive at a reasonable result. The threshold for determining the frivolity of a claim is high and such a determination under no circumstances presupposes in itself setting aside the guiding principle for cost allocation (i.e. \"the unsuccessful party pays\"). Pursuant to applicable law, the \"unsuccessful party pays\" principle is the starting point and likewise an essential circumstance the Tribunal is required to keep in mind when deciding on the reasonability of the result in apportioning costs.\n\n7.\n\nThus, the Tribunal's determination as to the frivolity or not of a claim is a determination which is prior to and independent of the consideration of the particular circumstances of the case in establishing a reasonable result.\n\n8.\n\nFor this reason, therefore, I do not agree with the conclusion of the majority of the Tribunal, which, having considered the facts of the dispute and allegations does not find elements to deem the claim \"frivolous\".3 Firstly, pursuant to the text and context of the applicable regulations, the frivolity of a claim does not depend on \"the facts or arguments put forward by the parties\", but simply on the content and scope of the claim. Secondly, the cases cited in this same paragraph by the majority that reached the decision on costs (the *Commerce Group*4 and *Corona Materials*5 cases), are insufficient, under the law the Tribunal is required to apply in this case (i.e. DR-CAFTA and UNCITRAL Rules) to justify their aforementioned conclusion. Thirdly, once a tribunal has decided that a claim is not frivolous, only then must it proceed to determine the apportioning of the costs bearing in mind the guiding criterion that \"the unsuccessful party pays\" and any other particular circumstances of the case, to reach a reasonable result.\n\nAward, \u00b6 632.\n\n*Commerce Group Corp. and San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inv. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/17, Award, March 14,2011.\n\n*Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3, Award, 31 de mayo de 2016.\n\n9.\n\nThe tribunal in the *Commerce Group* case held, without providing any grounds, that the power granted to the Tribunal under Article 10.20.6 of DR-CAFTA is limited to the determination of costs, considering only whether the claims filed by the claimants or the preliminary objection submitted by the respondent were \"frivolous\".6\n\n*Commerce Group*, \u00b6 137 (\"The Tribunal has found entirely in favor of Respondent. However, to conclude from Respondent's victory that Claimant' claims were \"frivolous\" would be to go too far. Indeed, the Tribunal has been presented with no indication that Claimants were not serious about the claims they asserted in these proceedings\").\n\n10.\n\nLikewise, the tribunal in *Corona Materials* held that the tribunal's discretion in allocating costs and fees is subject only to a single test \u2013 that of \"frivolity\".7\n\n*Corona Materials*, \u00b6 277 (\"Looking at DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6, the immediate test for the Arbitral Tribunal is to determine whether the claim was 'frivolous'. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that the facts surrounding the dispute and the allegations made demonstrate that the Claimant \u2013 even if it was wrong in the construction and application of the DR-CAFTA to said facts \u2013 had a bona fide claim and did not act with such wanton disregard of the facts and the law as to permit this tribunal to consider that its claim was 'frivolous'.\").\n\n11.\n\nTherefore, citing the *Commerce Group* and *Corona Materials* cases as valid precedents to justify the decision of the majority on costs is inappropriate. The tribunals that heard those cases were not bound, as is this Tribunal, to apply the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n12.\n\nAlthough ICSID Rules, like UNCITRAL Rules, grant tribunals a broad margin of discretion in deciding on cost allocation between the parties,8 the substantive difference lies in that the UNCITRAL Rules applicable to this case expressly states the criterion (\"the unsuccessful party pays\") from which other particular circumstances of the case should be considered to reach a reasonable result on cost allocation.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 28.\n\n13.\n\nMoreover, the above-mentioned cases cited by the majority as grounds for their decision on costs contradict the arguments made by other DR-CAFTA precedents, likewise cited by the majority: this is the case of the *Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala* ; *Pac Rim Cayman LLC. v. Republic of El Salvador* ; and *David R. Aven et al v. Republic of Costa Rica* precedents.9\n\nAward \u00b6 624.\n\n14.\n\nIn this context, the tribunal in *Railroad*10 does not take the \"frivolity\" of the unsuccessful party's allegations as a basis when deciding that the costs involved in the proceedings relating to the jurisdictional stage should be paid for by the respondent who was, ultimately, the unsuccessful party in that stage. Instead, in the allocation of procedural costs related to the merits, the tribunal decided that such costs should be apportioned equally between the respondent and the claimant.11 The tribunal clearly distinguishes the provisions it must apply when allocating the costs and expenses of the proceedings, acknowledging that the ICSID Rules do not impose any condition or requirement to decide on this matter. The tribunal likewise applied Article 10.20.6 of DR-CAFTA on the understanding that it had full discretion to decide on the costs and other tribunal's expenses.12 However, the tribunal, though not required to apply the UNCITRAL Rules, decided the allocation of the costs related to the jurisdictional stage by relying on the \"the unsuccessful party pays\" principle.\n\n*Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Award, June 29, 2012.\n\n*Railroad*, \u00b6 282 (\"Each party has pleaded that it be awarded counsel fees and expenses as well as the administrative expenses of ICSID and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal. CAFTA Article 10.26.1 permits the award of costs and attorney's fees in accordance with that section and the applicable arbitration rules. The ICSID Arbitration Rules only require that the award contain \"any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding\" (Rule 47). On the basis of the discretion bestowed on the Tribunal by CAFTA and the applicable arbitration rules, the Tribunal determines that they shall be responsible for their own counsel fees and expenses. As to administrative expenses of ICSID and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the Tribunal distinguishes between the jurisdictional phases and the merits phase of the proceedings. Given that Respondent's objections to jurisdiction were twice rejected in an unusually protracted process, Respondent shall be responsible for the administrative expenses of ICSID and fees and expenses of the Tribunal related to the two jurisdictional phases. Each party shall be responsible for 50% of the administrative expenses of ICSID and 50% of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal related to the merits phase..\").\n\n*Railroad*, \u00b6 283 (\"XII. Decision: [\u2026] 5. That the Respondent shall be responsible for the administrative expenses of ICSID and fees and expenses of the Tribunal related to the two jurisdictional phases [\u2026] 6. That each party shall be responsible for 50% of the remainder of administrative expenses of ICSID and of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal. 7. That each party shall be responsible for its own counsel fees and expenses.\").\n\n15.\n\nTherefore, the award given in *Railroad* does not help to provide support to justify the majority of the Tribunal's decision on costs.\n\n16.\n\nIn *Pac Rim*,13 the tribunal confirms, with some tempering, the principle that states that the unsuccessful party shall pay. This precedent, therefore, likewise fails to support the decision of the majority of the Tribunal on costs. The tribunal held that it had jurisdiction, dismissing the respondent's additional objections and dismissing on the merits all the damages and interest claims submitted by the claimant during the third stage of the arbitration. The tribunal orders the claimant to pay USD 8 million for the respondent's fees, while the costs of the procedure were to be apportioned equally between the parties.14\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Award, October 14, 2016.\n\n*Pac Rim*, \u00b6 12.1.\n\n17.\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, the tribunal held it had broad discretion to allocate costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Thus, the tribunal considered that the following factors were relevant when exercising its discretion:15\n\n**[t]he Tribunal has decided that the Respondent is to be considered the prevailing party in the merits phase of this arbitration**. Second, [\u2026] **the Tribunal decided in its Decisi\u00f3n on Jurisdiction that neither Party could be considered as having prevailed overall.** Third, [\u2026] whilst the Claimant's case prevailed over the Respondent's case under the Tribunal's Decision on Preliminary Objections, it was perhaps, as the Duke of Wellington might have put it (as he did of the Battle of Waterloo), a \"near-run thing\" with consequences for this third phase on the merits. Lastly, the Claimant's case prevailed over the Respondent's case on the latter's Additional Jurisdictional Objections\".16 (Emphasis my own)\n\n*Pac Rim*, \u00b6 11.17.\n\n*Pac Rim*, \u00b6 11.17.\n\n18.\n\nIt is evident from analyzing the *Pac Rim* case that the tribunal did not diverge from the general principle of \"the unsuccessful party pays\"17 but rather adapted its application to the favorable or adverse result of each party in each stage of the process. Therefore, and independently of the fact that the tribunal was not bound by the UNCITRAL Rules, this precedent also does not help to support the decision of the majority on costs.\n\nThe tribunal dismissed the claimant's head of claim for legal costs against the respondent and ordered the claimant to pay the respondent a proportion of its legal costs for a sum of USD 8 million (*Pac Rim*, \u00b6 11.18). As regards the tribunal's arbitration costs, the tribunal decided to dismiss each party's heads of claim in connection with the arbitration costs *inter se* and ordered that each party should pay its respective proportion of the arbitration costs (*Pac Rim*, \u00b6 11.19).\n\n19.\n\nIn the *David Aven*18 case, the tribunal held that Article 10.26.1 of DR-CAFTA provides that a tribunal may also allocate costs and attorney fees under this Section and the applicable arbitration rules. By considering that the applicable rules were precisely the UNCITRAL Rules, the tribunal pointed out that their Article 42 defines the standards for allocating costs based on the principle that arbitration costs should be paid by the unsuccessful party. This same standard authorizes the tribunal to apportion the costs between the parties, if it decides that the apportionment is reasonable taking into account the circumstances of the case.19\n\n*David R. Aven and others v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/3, Award, September 18, 2018.\n\n*David R. Aven, \u00b6* 752.\n\n20.\n\nThis way, the tribunal in *David Aven* does not even consider the option of restricting its discretion to merely assessing the eventual \"frivolity\" of the unsuccessful party when deciding on the allocation of costs and fees.20\n\n*David R. Aven*, \u00b6 756 (\"[t]he principle \"loser pays\" may be inferred from the rule of customary international law requiring \"full compensation\" [\u2026]. [T]he winning party suffered damages when having to finance its defense that proved to be useless and unnecessary and that would have been avoided if the defeated party had recognized the prevailing rights of the other to avoid litigation..\"), s. XIV (\"(1) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over certain Claimants' claims, as identified, and over Respondent's counterclaim; (2) Denies Claimants' claims under Article 10.5 DR-CAFTA and Annex 10-B; (3) Denies Claimants' claims under Article 10.7 DR-CAFTA and Annex 10-C; (4) Denies Respondent's counterclaim under Article 10 DR-CAFTA; (5) Orders Claimants to pay Respondent USD 1,090,905.10 for Respondent's portion of the advances paid by Respondent to ICSID on account of arbitrators' fees and expenses, ICSID administrative expenses, as well as direct expenses of the arbitration\").\n\n21.\n\nThe tribunal understood that it had the obligation to assess the circumstances of the case and the reasonability of costs (UNCITRAL Rules Article 42(1)) to conclude that,\n\n[i]n this case, the Claimants are unsuccessful regarding the merits, **but the Respondent is unsuccessful on the Counterclaim so the Tribunal shall take into account such \"circumstances of the case\" in order to decide on the apportionment of costs.**21 (Emphasis is my own)\n\n*David R. Aven*, \u00b6 760.\n\n22.\n\nThe tribunal in *David Aven* correctly interprets and applies DR-CAFTA and the UNCITRAL Rules when stating that the tribunal should consider as \"circumstances of the case\" \u2013 who was unsuccessful and who was successful at each stage of the proceedings \u2013 for the purpose of exercising its discretion in the apportioning of costs, pursuant to applicable law.\n\n23.\n\nIn short, the tribunal in *David Aven* did not even consider the potential or apparent \"frivolity\" of the claimant's claim or of the respondent's objections when deciding on the allocation of costs and fees. Although the tribunal decided that it did have jurisdiction, and thus the claimant is the prevailing party in that stage, the fact that on the merits the tribunal dismissed the claimant's heads of claim and the respondent's counterclaims, it eventually ordered that all the costs of the proceedings (*i.e.* arbitrator fees and expenses involved in the proceedings before ICSID) be paid for by the claimant, in other words, the unsuccessful party on the merits.\n\n24.\n\nThe *David Aven* precedent is also not helpful to support the decision taken by the majority of this Tribunal on costs and fees.\n\n25.\n\nAccordingly, based on everything stated so far, I disagree with the majority's holding that, in all the precedents cited, the tribunals took into account the circumstances of the case instead of directly applying the \"costs follow the events\" principle.22 A simple analysis of the cases previously cited, including the case in which the tribunal applied DR-CAFTA and the UNCITRAL Rules, confirms the opposite.\n\nAward, \u00b6 624 *in fine*.\n\n26.\n\nUnlike what the majority holds,23 and as has already been set forth previously, I consider that \"the frivolity of the claim\" must be determined pursuant to its content and scope. Once it has been defined that the claim is not frivolous, the particular circumstances of each case should be taken into account to give support to a reasonable result in the allocation of costs.\n\nAward, \u00b6 362.\n\n27.\n\nAmong the particular circumstances of this case, the majority deciding on costs cannot ignore, for the purpose of allocating such costs, that the Respondent was successful and the Claimants were unsuccessful, and therefore the Tribunal was unable to hear the merits of the claims. The very precedents cited by the majority that decided the issue of costs show that, even in some of those cases in which the UNCITRAL Rules were not a part of the applicable law, the characterization of successful party and unsuccessful party was considered as one of the particular circumstances and the starting point to keep in mind for the purpose of reaching a reasonable result in the allocation of costs.\n\n28.\n\nRegarding the scope which the majority assigns to the nature of the objection on the dominant and effective nationality of the Claimants as though this were a relevant circumstance to bear in mind, I consider that, while this objection sets forth a novel issue, it in no way warrants considering this case as a complex one to justify the existence of a special circumstance that would merit setting aside the application of the guiding principle on costs allocation.24 Unlike what the majority deciding on costs held,25 I consider that the power to interpret the applicable rules is not an exceptional role justifying the existence of a special circumstance. Rather, this power is part of the basic primary role any tribunal is required to assume when reaching a decision consistent with the law.\n\nAlthough in the context of this particular case at issue, the tribunal in *David Aven* held that \"[t]he Tribunal thinks that the issues that were submitted to its judgment, although showing some technical complexity, by themselves are not especially complex from a legal point of view. The complexity of this case arises rather from the actions and omissions of the parties than from the litigated issues.\" (*David R. Aven*, \u00b6 762).\n\nAward, \u00b6 629.\n\n29.\n\nFurthermore, within the particular circumstances of this case, one cannot overlook the effects of the Claimants' opposition to the request for bifurcation made by the Respondent. This opposition led to a majority decision by the Tribunal on bifurcation which demanded considerable time and effort and greater costs to the Parties throughout the procedure. These greater costs turned out to be unnecessary and fruitless since the Tribunal eventually reached a majority decision on its lack of jurisdiction.\n\n30.\n\nMoreover, I consider that when the majority deciding on costs holds that \"*the Claimants brought a credible case,*\"26 a value judgement is being made on the merits that exceeds the scope of the majority's decision as to the Tribunal's lack of jurisdiction.\n\nAward, \u00b6 633.\n\n31.\n\nIn the present case, the lack of jurisdiction makes no pre-judgement as to the merits of the issues brought, therefore, the Tribunal cannot and should not give an opinion on the merits. In this sense, the Tribunal, having decided by majority that it has no jurisdiction, is not empowered to give an opinion as to the consequences that the majority deciding on costs attempts to attribute to the allegations by the Claimants on the merits, by describing them as consisting of a \"credible case\". In this context, it is certainly understandable that the Tribunal should have an opinion to be able to determine whether the claim is frivolous or not. But that opinion must inexorably be based on the content and scope of the Claimants \"claim\" in the context of the jurisdictional stage, and not, as held by the majority, on \"the facts and allegations of the Parties\"27 as developed throughout the proceedings. In this award, the analysis of the majority decision on jurisdiction make no reference to the developments on the merits for the simple reason that such proceedings could not be taken into account as grounds for a decision on jurisdiction.\n\nAward, \u00b6 632.\n\n32.\n\nLikewise, I consider that not only the Claimants, but also the Respondent, acted in good faith and submitted their arguments on jurisdiction adequately and acted professionally during the proceedings. Therefore, it is my understanding that it is not possible to consider the behavior of one of the Parties as a special circumstance to benefit that Party as regards the other, which, as the successful Party, also displayed the same behavior.\n\n33.\n\nFinally, the majority that decided on costs failed to verify the reasonability of the result caused by its decision. It does not even base its reasoning on the cases it cites to provide a counterfactual test comparing the logical consequences of a possible decision in favor of the Claimants on jurisdiction and in favor of the Respondent on substance, with the decision on jurisdiction in favor of the Respondent adopted by the majority.\n\n34.\n\nTo conclude, a submission based on a claim that can be defined as \"not frivolous\" may, to my understanding, empower the Tribunal to mitigate the rigorousness of the guiding principle it is required to apply (\"the unsuccessful party pays\"), but not to ignore it, and much less to dismiss it. In this context, taking into account the behavior of the Parties and their legal counsel during the process, I consider that each of the Parties should bear their own costs and fees. Since, in accordance with the particular circumstances of the case, the Claimants have been unsuccessful in all of their jurisdictional claims, there has been no especial legal complexity involved in the issues submitted, and in view of the costs incurred as a consequence of the Claimants' opposition to the request for bifurcation made by the Respondent, it is reasonable to decide that the expenses of the PCA and arbitrator fees and expenses should be borne entirely by the unsuccessful Party, *i.e.* the Claimants.\n\n35.\n\nFor all the reasons set forth above, and agreeing that each Party should bear its own costs and legal fees incurred throughout the proceedings, I dissent with the majority that decided on costs, with regards to their decision to allocate the costs of the PCA proceedings and the Tribunal's fees and expenses equally among the Parties. I therefore consider that PCA's costs, including the Tribunal's fees and expenses, should be borne entirely by the Claimants after due consideration of the particular circumstances of the case that justify the reasonability of the abovementioned apportionment."}, {"Title": "Partial Dissent of Ms. Cheek on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Partial Dissent of Ms. Cheek on Jurisdiction\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nWhile agreeing with many of the factual findings of the Majority, I respectfully register my dissent with regard to the test articulated for assessing the dominant and effective nationality of the Claimants and the ultimate conclusion of the Majority that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider the merits of the Ballantines' claims based on a finding that their dominant and effective nationality on the relevant dates is Dominican.1 I join the Award as to costs.\n\nTerms defined in the Award have the same meaning in this dissenting opinion.\n\n2.\n\nI am in agreement with my colleagues that, as a threshold matter, DR-CAFTA instructs that dual citizens such as the Ballantines may only assert a claim against the Dominican Republic if their dominant and effective nationality is, in this case, that of the United States at the time of the alleged breach and at the time of submission of the claim.2 I also concur with many of the factual findings set forth in the Award. However, I respectfully dissent from the Majority's articulation of the legal test for dominant and effective nationality and the Majority's conclusion that Claimants' dominant and effective nationality on the critical dates is Dominican.\n\nAward, para. 527.\n\n3.\n\nAs explained below, through the inclusion of the phrase \"dominant and effective nationality\" in Article 10.28, the parties to the DR-CAFTA incorporated the customary international law standard for the treatment of dual nationality that this Tribunal is bound to apply. While my colleagues acknowledge the customary international law standard for assessing dominant and effective nationality, they ultimately depart from it. The Majority's analysis gives great weight to the Ballantines' investment-based contacts with the Dominican Republic during a narrow window of time.3 While dominant and effective nationality must be assessed on certain dates, namely, the date of the alleged breach and the date of submission of the claim, it is the entire life of the individual that is relevant to the analysis. In other words, dominant and effective nationality is a distinct legal test separate and apart from the making of, maintenance of, or injury to a claimant's investment. When the customary international law standard is properly applied to the Ballantines, the conclusion reached is that the Ballantines' dominant and effective nationality on the critical dates is that of the United States.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Award, para 583 (\"[T]his Tribunal finds relevant the fact that the main reason for the Claimants to acquire a second nationality was the *investment directly related to this proceeding.\"* (emphasis in original)).\n\n**II. ASSESSING DOMINANT AND EFFECTIVE NATIONALITY**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nArticle 10.28 of the DR-CAFTA states that \"a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality.\"4 Through the use of the phrase \"dominant and effective nationality,\" the DR-CAFTA parties adopted the customary international law standard for determining nationality of dual citizens. I disagree with my colleagues, as set out in paragraph 530 of the Award, that the Tribunal should only \"take guidance from customary international law, taking into account Article 10.28 particular context, within DR-CAFTA general object and purpose.\"5 Rather than \"giving effect to the specific context provided for in this instrument as well as its object and purpose,\"6 the customary international law standard referenced in DR-CAFTA should be applied, without altering that test in an investment treaty-specific context. I disagree with the Majority that it is \"appropriate to give specific meaning to the terms used in DR-CAFTA rather than directly incorporating any other standard[\u2026]\"7\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.28 (R-10).\n\nAward, para. 530.\n\nAward, para. 530\n\nAward, para. 533.\n\n5.\n\nArticle 10.22 of the DR-CAFTA states that the governing law for this dispute is \"this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.\"8 Where the DR-CAFTA parties have incorporated a rule of customary international law into the treaty, as they have done with regard to the dominant and effective nationality test, the Tribunal should simply apply it.\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.22(1) (R-10).\n\n6.\n\nThe standard in DR-CAFTA is the customary international law standard to determine dominant and effective nationality, articulated by the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") in the *Nottebohm Case*9 and reflected in the *Merg\u00e9 Case* of the Italian-United States Conciliation Commission10 and decisions of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, notably *Case No. A/18* and *Malek v. Iran*.11\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Lichtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment, (April 6, 1995), p. 23 (RLA-6) [hereinafter *Nottebohm Case*].\n\n*United States v. Italy*, It.\u2013U.S. Conciliation Commission, Decision, (June 10, 1955) (RLA-7) [hereinafter *Merg\u00e9 Case*].\n\n*Case No. A/18*, IUSCT Case. No. A/18, Decision No. DEC 32-A18-FT, (April 6, 1984) (RLA-8) [hereinafter *Case No. A/18*]; *Reza Said Malek v. Iran,* IUSCT, Interlocutory Award, (June 23, 1988) (CLA-51) [hereinafter *Malek*].\n\n7.\n\nAccording to the ICJ in *Nottebohm*, \"nationality is a legal bond having as its basis a social fact of attachment, a genuine connection of existence, interests and sentiments, together with the existence of reciprocal rights and duties.\"12 While the ICJ in *Nottebohm* was not concerned with dual nationality (the question in that case was one of diplomatic protection), the ICJ referenced the customary international law standard in cases of multiple nationalities, observing that:\n\nInternational arbitrators have decided in the same way numerous cases of dual nationality, where the question arose with regard to the exercise of protection. They have given their preference to the real and effective nationality, that which accorded with the facts, that based on stronger factual ties between the person concerned and one of the States whose nationality is involved. Different factors are taken into consideration, and their importance will vary from one case to the next[\u2026]13\n\n*Nottebohm Case*, p. 23 (RLA-6).\n\n*Nottebohm Case*, p. 22 (RLA-6). *See also Merg\u00e9 Case*, p. 244 (citing *Nottebohm Case*, p. 22) (RLA-7).\n\n8.\n\nTo determine a natural person's dominant and effective nationality is thus a fact-specific inquiry. As the Majority observes at paragraph 548, quoting *Nottebohm*, \"the habitual residence of the individual concerned is an important factor, but there are other factors such as the centre of his interests, his family ties, his participation in public life, attachment shown by him for a given country and inculcated in his children, etc.\"14\n\nAward para. 548 (citing *Nottebohm Case*, p. 22 (RLA-6)). The Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal also made reference to these factors as relevant, although it stated that it would consider \"all relevant factors\". *See Case No. A/18*, p. 12 (RLA-8).\n\n9.\n\nThe *Merg\u00e9 Case* and *Case No. A/18* reiterate this customary international law test. The *Merg\u00e9 Case* tribunal observed that *Nottebohm* \"is not a case of dual nationality; but it is interesting for our purposes to note what is set forth in the reasoning of the decision in regard to the problem of dual nationality[,]\" and went on to quote the *Nottebohm* passage above.15 The tribunal in the *Merg\u00e9 Case* then applied the test articulated in *Nottebohm:*\n\nIn order to establish the prevalence of the United States nationality in individual cases, habitual residence can be one of the criteria of evaluation, but not the only one. The conduct of the individual in his economic, social, political, civic and family life, as well as the closer and more effective bond with one of the two States must also be considered.16\n\n*Merg\u00e9 Case,* p. 244 (RLA-7).\n\n*Merg\u00e9 Case,* p. 247 (RLA-7).\n\n10.\n\nSimilarly, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in *Case No. A/18* observed that the *Nottebohm Case* \"demonstrated the acceptance and approval by the International Court of Justice of the search for the real and effective nationality based on the facts of a case, instead of an approach relying on more formalistic criteria.\"17 The Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal went on to conclude that it had jurisdiction over cases of dual citizens against Iran where the dominant and effective nationality of the claimant was that of the United States. It then adopted the test in *Nottebohm* : \"In determining the dominant and effective nationality, the Tribunal will consider all relevant factors, including habitual residence, center of interests, family ties, participation in public life and other evidence of attachment.\"18\n\n*Case No. A/18*, p. 10 (RLA-8).\n\n*Case No. A/18*, p. 12 (RLA-8).\n\n11.\n\nWhile dominant and effective nationality must be assessed on the date the claim arose and the date the claim was submitted for purposes of jurisdiction, the relevant period of time for determining dominant and effective nationality on those dates is an individual's contacts over a lifetime. As the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal explained in *Malek*, \"[o]bviously, to establish what is the dominant and effective nationality at the date the claim arose, it is necessary to scrutinize the events in the Claimant's life preceding this date. Indeed, the entire life of the Claimant, from birth, and all the factors which during this span of time, evidence the reality and the sincerity of the choice of national allegiance he claims to have made, are relevant.\"19\n\n*Malek*, p. 51 (CLA-51).\n\n12.\n\n*Nottebohm* and its progeny's list of considerations is not exhaustive, but it nevertheless establishes an objective factual inquiry. I disagree with my colleagues that application of the dominant and effective nationality test set forth in DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 should be applied to give greater weight to investment-related connections with the Dominican Republic because DR-CAFTA is an investment treaty. Specifically, I disagree with the Majority that \"the inclusion of this phrase [*i.e*., dominant and effective nationality] in an investment chapter within the broader framework of a Free Trade Agreement imbues that phrase with a specific meaning\" and therefore \"it [is] appropriate to give specific meaning to the terms used in DR-CAFTA rather than directly incorporating any other standard... [\u2026]\"20 The standard articulated in DR-CAFTA is not an investment treaty-specific test for dominant and effective nationality. Rather, it is the well-established customary international law standard. My opinion in this regard is consistent with the recent decision in *Aven v. Costa Rica*, where the tribunal applied the *Nottebohm* test in examining the question of dual nationality under DR-CAFTA Article 10.28.21\n\nAward, para. 533.\n\n*See* Award, para. 543, n. 1056. *David Aven et al. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/3, Award (18 September 2018), para. 205 (\"Through inclusion of the expression 'dominant and effective nationality' in Article 10.28 definition of 'Investor of a Party,' the DR-CAFTA Parties intended to incorporate by reference the applicable standards of customary international law for the treatment of multiple nationalities in diplomatic protection cases, as reflected in the *Nottebohm* Case *(Liechtenstein v. Guatemala)*.\").\n\n13.\n\nWhile the Majority and I agree that the Claimants' entire lifetime is relevant to the dominant and effective nationality inquiry, we diverge where the Majority also focuses on what it deems the specific context of DR-CAFTA for the dominant and effective nationality test.22 The Majority \"considers that the *investment* itself, the status of *investor* as well as other circumstances surrounding those elements may be relevant factors for assessing nationality and its dominance and effectiveness within Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA.\"23 This appears to go beyond an examination of the Claimants' economic ties to both countries over their lifetimes. The Majority concludes that \"a claimant's entire life is relevant but not dispositive\"24 and examines whether the Claimants' Dominican nationality \"was strong enough to take precedence over their U.S. nationality and it was producing effects or was operative *during the relevant time* in order to determine whether they were investors under DR-CAFTA.\"25 The result of this approach, which the Majority describes elsewhere as \"temporal context in which the terms of Article 10.28 shall be interpreted,\"26 is to give greater weight to the Claimants' investment-related contacts as of the date the claim arose and the date the claim was submitted,27 rather than engaging in a truly holistic inquiry of the Claimants' entire lifetimes on each of those dates.\n\n*See* Award, Section X.B.2(e).\n\nAward, para. 554.\n\nAward, para. 555.\n\nAward, para. 557 (emphasis added).\n\nAward, para. 527.\n\n*See, e.g.*, Award, para. 597 (\"[W]hile this Tribunal cannot deny the fact that *during the relevant period*, the Claimants maintained connections to the United States and this also seems natural from the fact that they were born and lived in that country for the majority of their lives, in this Tribunal's opinion, *during the relevant period* the Dominican nationality was effective and took precedence over the American nationality. Although the Claimants maintained residential connections to the United States, their permanent residence was in the Dominican Republic, overall, most of their days from 2010 to 2014 were spent in the Dominican Republic, they changed their status to permanent residents and later to Dominican citizens.\") (emphasis added); *see also* Award, para. 598 (\"While their personal and professional relations to the Dominican Republic may have been limited, it is difficult to deny that *during that period of time* their investment kept them economically centered in the Dominican Republic.\") (emphasis added).\n\n14.\n\nThe proper inquiry should examine the Claimants' ties to the United States and the Dominican Republic over the course of their lifetimes to determine whether, at the time of the alleged breach (*i.e*., 12 September 2011)28 and at the time of the submission of the claim to arbitration (*i.e*., 11 September 2014), the dominant and effective nationality of each Claimant was that of the United States or the Dominican Republic.29\n\n12 September 2011 is presumed to be the date the claim arose, as that is the date the Ballantines' expansion request was denied by the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources of the Dominican Republic on the basis that the slopes on the upper portion of the property exceeded the 60 percent slope permitted under Article 122 of the Environmental Law and because it was considered an environmentally fragile area, creating a natural risk. *See* Award, para. 126 (citing Letter from Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez de Gutierrez to Michael Ballantine (September 12, 2011) (C-8)).\n\nTo the extent \"effective\" nationality also reflects a concept that citizenship is valid as a legal matter and there is a *bona fide* connection between the natural person and the State, the Parties agree that concept has been satisfied here. *See* Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, para. 44 (\"Typically, the first step in the 'dominant and effective nationality' analysis is to identify a person's 'effective' nationalities (*i.e.*, any nationalities for which there exists a *bona fide* connection between the person and the State of nationality). In the present case, however, this first step is unnecessary, as it is uncontested that the Ballantines \u2014 who are nationals of both the Dominican Republic and the United States \u2014 have genuine connections to both States.\" (internal citations omitted)).\n\n**III. THE DOMINANT AND EFFECTIVE NATIONALITY OF MICHAEL BALLANTINE AND LISA BALLANTINE.**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nDominant and effective nationality must be assessed as to each Claimant, applying the customary international law standard articulated in *Nottebohm*. The relevant dates for determining dominant and effective nationality are 12 September 2011 (the date of the alleged breach) and 11 September 2014 (the date of submission of the claim). For the reasons explained below, both Ms. Ballantine and Mr. Ballantine had dominant and effective U.S. nationality on both critical dates.\n\n16.\n\nLisa Ballantine\u2019s connections to both the United States and the Dominican Republic can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine was born and lived in the United States until 2000,30 that is, for approximately the first forty years of her life. The center of her interests during this period, including her family ties and participation in public life through civic and religious groups, was the United States. The center of her professional life was also in the United States. At all relevant times, Ms. Ballantine was a U.S. citizen.\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine worked as a missionary in the Dominican Republic for a year in 2000, and returned to the United States in 2001.31\n\n\u2022 She then moved to the Dominican Republic in August 2006, along with her husband and children.32 The Ballantines enrolled their children in the American School in the Dominican Republic, attended an American church,33 and spoke English at both church and at home.34 Ms. Ballantine lived in the Dominican Republic from 2006 until this claim was submitted.35\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine sold much of her property in the United States when she moved to the Dominican Republic,36 but maintained property in the United States throughout her time living in the Dominican Republic37 and also filed income tax returns in the United States.38\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine purchased significant property in the Dominican Republic from 2003 to 2011,39 and much of the property was purchased while she was solely a U.S. national.\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine became a legal permanent resident of the Dominican Republic in 2006, which status was renewed in 2008.40\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine became a naturalized Dominican citizen in 2010, her application for citizenship having been approved on 30 December 2009.41 She maintained her U.S. citizenship as well.\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine also naturalized two of her four children in 2010.42 Those two children would later return to the United States for college.43\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine voted in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the 2012 Dominican election, and the 2014 midterm U.S. elections, while residing in the Dominican Republic.44\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine became a Dominican citizen because she had a significant investment there and she thought her Dominican citizenship might result in better treatment for her investment, and also for estate planning purposes.45\n\n\u2022 In 2010 and 2011, Ms. Ballantine spent more days on an annual basis in the United States than in the Dominican Republic.46\n\n\u2022 In 2012, 2013, and 2014, Ms. Ballantine spend more days on an annual basis in the Dominican Republic than in the United States, although still traveled frequently (approximately 110 days/year) to the United States.47\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine traveled to the United States approximately 30 times between 2010 and 2014.48\n\n\u2022 During the 2010 to 2014 period, Ms. Ballantine continued to work with her U.S. nonprofit organization, Filter Pure, Inc.,49 which partners with local NGOs around the world, including in the Dominican Republic, to develop water programs. Filter Pure, Inc. had significant operations in the Dominican Republic.50 Since 99 percent of its donations came from U.S. donors, Ms. Ballantine, who was responsible for fundraising, spent much of her time in the United States.51\n\n\u2022 Ms. Ballantine described her cultural connection to the Dominican Republic as \"limited,\"52 although she also spoke of the Dominican Republic on social media as \"our country.\"53 I agree with the Majority view that she had personal attachments both to the United States and the Dominican Republic.54 Connections to the United States were not displaced with connections to the Dominican Republic.\n\nAward, para. 179.\n\nAward, para. 179 (citing Amended Statement of Claim, para. 18; Jamaca de Dios Website, \"History\" Page (last accessed January 24, 2017) (R-11)).\n\nAward, para. 179 (citing Greg Wittstock, *A Man and His Mountain, A Woman and Her Heart* (February 27, 2013) (R-12); Notice of Intent, paras. 7, 12)..\n\nAward, para. 182 (citing First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, paras. 89-90.).\n\nAward., para. 568.\n\nAward, para. 562.\n\nAward, para. 563 (citing First Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, paras. 1-3).\n\nAward, paras. 564, 207 (citing Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, para. 8).\n\nAward, para. 210 (citing Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, para. 11; Letter from Catalano, Caboor & Co, C-80).\n\nAward, para. 58.\n\nAward, para. 563, n. 1079; Certificates of Permanent Residency of Michael and Lisa Ballantine (R-25).\n\nAward, para. 566, n. 1082 (noting that \"[t]he Claimants have indicated that they obtained the Dominican nationality in 2010.

That said, this shift in focus, even coupled with Ms. Ballantine\u2019s naturalization in 2010, is not enough to support a finding that Ms. Ballantine\u2019s dominant and effective nationality on the critical dates *(i.e.,* 12 September 2011 and 11 September 2014) was Dominican.\n\n18.\n\nLooking holistically at Ms. Ballantine\u2019s habitual residence during her lifetime, the centre of her personal and professional interests, her family life, and her maintenance of significant ties to the United States, the facts support a finding that under customary international law Ms. Ballantine\u2019s dominant and effective nationality is that of the United States. Ms. Ballantine chose to nationalize in the Dominican Republic because she and her husband owned a significant investment and thought it might bolster the success of their business. Less than two years later, the alleged breach in this case arose. That Ms. Ballantine chose Dominican nationality not necessarily for love of country and allegiance, but out of economic self-interest, does not lead to a conclusion that her dominant and effective nationality was Dominican on the critical dates. Ms. Ballantine\u2019s economic ties to the Dominican Republic and her narrow reasons for seeking Dominican citizenship are but two of many relevant factors to be considered in this analysis.\n\n19.\n\nMichael Ballantine\u2019s connections to both the United States and the Dominican Republic can be summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ballantine was born and lived in the United States until 2000,55 that is, for approximately the first forty years of his life. The center of his interests during this period, including his family ties, participation in public life through civic and religious groups, was in the United States. At all relevant times, Mr. Ballantine was a U.S. citizen.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ballantine worked as a missionary in the Dominican Republic for a year in 2000, and returned to the United States in 2001.56\n\n\u2022 He then moved to the Dominican Republic five years later, in 2006, along with his wife and children.57 The Ballantines enrolled their children in the American School in the Dominican Republic.58 They attended an American church,59 and spoke English both at church and at home.60 Mr. Ballantine lived in the Dominican Republic from 2006 until this claim was submitted.61\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ballantine sold much of his property in the United States when he moved to the Dominican Republic,62 but maintained property in the United States throughout his time living in the Dominican Republic63 and also filed income tax returns in the United States.64\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ballantine also purchased significant property in the Dominican Republic from 2003 to 2011,65 and much of the property was purchased while he was solely a U.S. national.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ballantine became a legal permanent resident of the Dominican Republic in 2006, which status was renewed in 2008.66\n\n\u2022 He became a naturalized Dominican citizen in 2010, his application for citizenship having been approved on 30 December 2009.67 Mr. Ballantine maintained his U.S. citizenship as well.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ballantine also naturalized two of his four children in 2010.68 Those two children would later return to the United States for college.69\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ballantine voted in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, the 2012 Dominican election, and the 2014 midterm U.S. elections, while residing in the Dominican Republic.70\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ballantine became a Dominican citizen because he had a significant investment there and he thought his Dominican citizenship might result in better treatment for his investment, and also for estate planning purposes.71\n\n\u2022 From 2010 to 2014, Mr. Ballantine spent more days on an annual basis in the Dominican Republic than in the United States, although he still traveled frequently to the United States.72 Mr. Ballantine traveled to the United States approximately 30 times between 2010 and 2014.73\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ballantine\u2019s business, Jamaca de Dios, was based in the Dominican Republic, and that was the focus of his professional life.74\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ballantine testified that he did little to assimilate with Dominican culture.75 He also attested to his close bond with the Dominican Republic when he sought citizenship.76 I agree with the Majority view that he had personal attachments both to the United States and the Dominican Republic.77 Connections to the United States were not displaced with connections to the Dominican Republic.\n\nAward, para. 179.\n\nAward, para. 179.\n\nAward, para. 179.\n\nAward, para. 568 (citing Supplemental Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, para. 24; Second Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, para. 3).\n\nAward, para. 568.\n\nAward, para. 568.\n\nAward, para. 562.\n\nAward, para. 563 (citing Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, para. 3).\n\nAward, paras. 564, 207 (citing Suppl.

Rodr\u00edguez to the President of the Dominican Republic (R-17)).\n\nAward, para. 573.\n\n20.\n\nThere is no question that the focal point of Mr. Ballantine\u2019s daily life shifted from the United States to the Dominican Republic when he moved with his wife and young children to the Dominican Republic in 2006. Further, even before acquiring Dominican citizenship, but certainly from 2010 to 2014, Mr. Ballantine\u2019s economic ties to the Dominican Republic were stronger than his economic ties to the United States, as he spent more time in the Dominican Republic because his business was there.\n\n21.\n\nNevertheless, looking holistically at Mr. Ballantine\u2019s life, and considering his habitual residence during his lifetime, his family life, the center of his personal and professional interests, and his maintenance of significant ties to the United States through both family and property, the facts support a finding that under the customary international law standard of dominant and effective nationality, Mr. Ballantine was a U.S. national on the critical dates. Mr. Ballantine chose to nationalize in the Dominican Republic because he and his wife owned a significant investment there and thought it might bolster the success of their business. Less than two years after their naturalization, the alleged breach in this case arose. That Mr. Ballantine chose Dominican nationality not necessarily for love of country and allegiance, but out of economic self-interest, does not lead to a conclusion that his dominant and effective nationality was Dominican on the critical dates. Mr. Ballantine\u2019s economic ties to the Dominican Republic and his narrow reasons for seeking Dominican citizenship are but two of many relevant factors to be considered in this analysis.\n\n22.\n\nIt is worth noting that the consequence of the Majority\u2019s determination that the Ballantines are dominantly and effectively Dominican is that the Ballantines could bring a DR-CAFTA claim against the United States, assuming that alleged harm to an investment in the United States occurred during the same relevant time frame as in the instant case. It is difficult to imagine that if the Ballantines launched this hypothetical case against the United States under DR-CAFTA, such a case could move forward based on a dominant Dominican nationality of the Claimants. The factual record simply does not support such a conclusion.\n\n**IV. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BALLANTINES' DECISION TO OBTAIN DOMINICAN CITIZENSHIP.**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Majority is troubled by the Ballantines' motivation for seeking Dominican citizenship, which Mr. Ballantine described at the Hearing as \"it was only \u2500 had to do with economics and it had to do with estate protection. I did not integrate with the culture. I was an investor.\"78 I agree with the Majority, quoting *Nottebohm*, that \"[n]aturalization is not a matter to be taken lightly. To seek and to obtain it is not something that happens frequently in the life of a human being.\"79 Naturalization is a commitment and a responsibility on the part of an individual to the country he swears allegiance to.\n\nAward, para. 581 (citing Hearing Transcript, Day 2, pp. 479-80).\n\nAward, para. 582 (citing *Nottebohm Case*, p. 24 (RLA-6)).\n\n24.\n\nBut in this particular case, what should the legal consequences be of the Ballantines' motivation for seeking Dominican citizenship? If the Ballantines were motivated by a desire to protect their investment, should that prevent them from filing a claim as U.S. nationals under the DR-CAFTA? Such a question standing alone is not one of dominant and effective nationality, but one of bad faith or abuse of rights. When determining the dominant and effective nationality of Mr. and Mrs. Ballantine, the circumstances surrounding the Ballantines' naturalization in the Dominican Republic is simply a factor to be considered as part of a holistic examination of the facts.\n\n25.\n\nWith regard to bad faith or abuse of rights, both Parties agree that the Ballantines did not acquire a second nationality as a form of treaty shopping to gain access to a dispute settlement mechanism.80 In fact, their Dominican nationality had the potential to defeat their ability to bring a claim. Claimants did not take steps to avail themselves of a second nationality so they could gain protections under DR-CAFTA or bring a claim they would not otherwise have been entitled to bring. They made their investments as U.S. nationals, and the steps they took to become Dominican nationals involved a risk that they would jeopardize their ability to bring a potential future investment claim against the Dominican Republic.\n\n*See* Reply Memorial, para. 33 (\"There can be no question that the Ballantines did not take citizenship in the DR to obtain treaty protection.\"); Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, para. 44 (\"it uncontested that the Ballantines \u2500 who are nationals of both the Dominican Republic and the United States \u2500 have genuine connections to both states.\" (internal citations omitted).).\n\n26.\n\nOn these facts, the Dominican Republic chose not to allege bad faith or abuse of rights in this case, and rightly so.\n\n27.\n\nIt is commonplace for a U.S. corporation to incorporate a wholly-owned subsidiary abroad in order to do business. In the typical case, the U.S. corporation would have created a Dominican corporation for the ease of doing business \u2013 for buying property, paying employees, etc. \u2013 and the U.S. company would maintain ownership over its subsidiary and manage it from afar. There is no question that the U.S. company could bring a claim on behalf of that U.S.-owned Dominican enterprise under DR-CAFTA.81\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.16.1(b) (R-10).\n\n28.\n\nThe difference between the Ballantines and this hypothetical U.S. corporation is that the Ballantines were small business owners, and while they created a Dominican corporation for the ease of doing business, they decided not to manage it from afar. Instead, they moved to the Dominican Republic and chose to directly manage and run their investments with personal devotion and commitment.\n\n29.\n\nIn this case, these two U.S. nationals acquired a second nationality in 2010 in an effort to help their investments thrive. Under those circumstances, the second nationality does not become the dominant one by virtue of the investment-related motivations of the Claimants. Instead, the test for dominant and effective nationality remains a holistic one that focuses on the totality of one's personal, familial, economic, and civic ties over a lifetime. Under that test, both Lisa and Michael Ballantine are U.S. nationals who qualified as U.S. investors under the DR-CAFTA at the time of the alleged breach and at the time they submitted their claims against the Dominican Republic.\n\n**V. CONCLUSION**\n-----------------\n\n30.\n\nFor these reasons, I am unable to join the Award with regard to the Majority's decision on jurisdiction and must with all due respect issue this dissenting opinion with regard to the Majority's determination that this tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the Ballantines' claims. I join the Award as to costs. For the reasons set forth in the Award, it is appropriate in the circumstances of this case for each party to bear its own legal fees and expenses and for each party to bear half of the costs of the arbitration."}], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**GLOSSARY OF TERMS**\n---------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Amended Statement of** **Claim** | The Claimants' Amended Statement

The Claimants own and control Jamaca de Dios S.R.L. and Aroma de la Monta\u00f1a, E.I.R.L., two enterprises organized under the laws of the Dominican Republic (the \"**Enterprises**\"). In the present proceedings, the Claimants are represented by:\n\nMr. Matthew G.

OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nFrom 2005 onwards, the Claimants began developing Jamaca de Dios, a luxury residential housing project located in Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic. The present dispute arose after the Claimants encountered certain difficulties when carrying out their activities in Jamaca de Dios. In particular, the Claimants allege that certain environmental regulations established by the Respondent, and its corresponding enforcement, violated the Claimants' rights under DR-CAFTA.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. INITIATION OF THE DISPUTE**\n--------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn June 12, 2014, the Claimants notified the Respondent of their intent to submit a claim to arbitration (the \"**Notice of Intent**\"), in accordance with Article 10.16.1(b) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the \"**DR-CAFTA**\"), signed on August 5, 2004 and entered into force on March 1, 2007 between its Contracting Parties (the \"**Contracting Parties**\").\n\n5.\n\nOn September 11, 2014, the Claimants submitted, on their own behalf and on behalf of their Enterprises, their Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim (the \"**Notice of Arbitration**\"), pursuant to Articles 3 and 20 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (the \"**UNCITRAL Rules**\"), as adopted in 2013, and Articles 10.16.1(a), 10.16.1(b), and 10.16.3(c) of the DR-CAFTA.\n\n**B. CONSTITUTION OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn September 11, 2014, on the occasion of serving on the Respondent the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants appointed Mr. Henry Burnett, a national of the United States, as the first arbitrator.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated October 8, 2014, the Claimants informed that Mr. Henry Burnett had withdrawn his acceptance to act as arbitrator. In replacement, the Claimants appointed Ms. Marney Cheek, a national of the United States, as the first arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nOn January 25, 2016, the Respondent appointed Prof. Ra\u00fal Vinuesa, a national of Argentina and Spain, as the second arbitrator.\n\n9.\n\nOn May 27, 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that pursuant to the Parties' Joint Protocol for ICSID Appointment, Mr. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez, a national of Mexico, had been appointed as Presiding Arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated June 3, 2016, Mr. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez accepted his appointment as Presiding Arbitrator. On the same day, the Arbitral Tribunal was fully constituted.\n\n11.\n\nOn August 10, 2016, the Parties and the Tribunal signed a document entitled **Terms of Appointment**. Among other things, the Parties confirmed that all members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed in accordance with the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules. Additionally, each member of the Tribunal confirmed that they were and shall remain impartial and independent of the Parties and that they had disclosed, to the best of their knowledge, all current circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to their independence and impartiality, and that they would disclose without delay any such circumstance that may arise in the future.\n\n**C. THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT**\n--------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThis Arbitration has been initiated pursuant to Articles 10.15 and 10.16 of DR-CAFTA:\n\nArticle 10.16: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration\n\n1.

The Spanish version thereof was submitted on March 23, 2017.\n\n28.\n\nOn March 10, 2017, the Claimants submitted their Surreply to the Respondent's Reply on Bifurcation (the \"**Surreply on Bifurcation**\"). The Spanish version thereof was submitted on March 22, 2017.\n\n29.\n\nOn March 29, 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the bifurcation request had been denied but a reasoned decision would be issued later.\n\n30.\n\nOn April 21, 2017, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No 2**, whereby the majority of the Tribunal rejected the bifurcation request and decided to hear the jurisdictional objection together with the merits of the Claimants' claim.\n\n31.\n\nOn May 26, 2017, the Respondent submitted its Statement of Defense and Objections to Jurisdiction, dated May 25, 2017 (the \"**Statement of Defense**\").

The Respondent was invited to answer to the Claimants' Response in its Rejoinder, and in turn, the Claimants were invited to submit their surreply in their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n40.\n\nAs a result of certain issues that arose between the Parties in December 2017 when the Respondent intended to visit Jamaca de Dios, several exchanges of correspondence ensued between the Parties and the Tribunal. Consequently, **Procedural Orders Nos. 8, 9, 10 and 13** were issued by the Tribunal on March 4, April 20, May 14, and August 30, 2018, respectively.3\n\nA full account of those procedural events need not be reproduced in full here.

Booth, Ramboll\n\nBy videoconference from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.\n\n49.\n\nDuring the Hearing, information emerged regarding the funding of the Claimants' legal costs by a third party.6 The Tribunal then heard the Parties' submissions on the relevance and consequences arising from the fact that the Claimants' claims were being funded by a third party. After reflecting on the Parties' positions, the Tribunal ordered the Claimants to disclose only to the Tribunal and the PCA the agreement that the Claimants had concluded with the third-party funder.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 501:7-502:23 (English).\n\n50.\n\nAfter reviewing the agreement, and at the Respondent's request, the Tribunal ordered the Claimants to disclose to the Respondent the identity of the third-party funder, and the date of the agreement, to discard any conflicts of interest. On October 2, 2018, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 16** to address the issue of the third-party funder. Among other things, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, to the best of its knowledge, the third-party's involvement in the arbitration did not raise conflicts of interest for any of the Tribunal's members.\n\n51.\n\nAt the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties several questions, which were replied orally by the Parties' counsel. Additionally, the Tribunal made the Parties aware that the submission of post-hearing briefs would not be expected.\n\n**I. POST-HEARING DEVELOPMENTS**\n--------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nOn April 19, 2019, the Parties filed their respective submissions on costs (the \"**Claimants' Costs Submission**\" and the \"**Respondent's Costs Submission**\").\n\n53.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, the Respondent amended its Costs Submission, reflecting newly acquired information (the \"**Respondent's Amended Costs Submission**\").\n\n54.\n\nOn July 17, 2019, after having duly consulted the Parties, the Tribunal declared the closure of hearings pursuant to Article 31(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n55.\n\nIn 2000, Michael Ballantine, Lisa Ballantine and their children travelled to the Dominican Republic to work as Christian missionaries and to undertake humanitarian work, including the distribution of water filters through a non-profit entity created by Lisa Ballantine.7 While they returned to Chicago in 2001, they continued their work in the Dominican Republic, \"*visiting the country each year to further support the communities they had begun to serve*\".8\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 2; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19; First Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 20.\n\n56.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Claimants noticed that in the mountains around Jarabacoa there was no successful luxury real estate development with shared infrastructure and amenities, even though they considered it an ideal place for such a project.9\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 21; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 7-10.\n\n57.\n\nThus, the Claimants began purchasing mountain property in the area of Palo Blanco in Jarabacoa. The Claimants distinguish two phases in the development of Jamaca de Dios,10 phase 1 \u2013 which focused on the lower portion of the property and was commenced in 200511 \u2013 (\"**Phase 1**\"), and phase 2 \u2013 which was intended to expand the project towards the upper part of the mountain and was commenced in 2009 (\"**Phase 2**\").12\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 39.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 64.\n\n58.\n\nIn 2003, the Claimants bought their first tract, 218,552 square meters, from Francisco Sanch\u00eds. Between 2004 and 2008, they bought additional land rights, primarily from the family of Carlos Manuel Duran. By 2009, all of the land in Phase 1 of Jamaca de Dios was titled to the Claimants' name, as well as, 140,835 square meters of Phase 2. By September 2010, the Claimants owned 194,500 of the 283,000 square meters of Phase 2.13 On January 7, 2011, 45,036.40 square meters were purchased from Ram\u00f3n Amable Rodr\u00edguez.14 On January 14, 2011, 9,905.78 square meters were acquired from Mar\u00eda Consuelo Rodr\u00edguez.15 On February 9, 2011, 15,130 square meters were bought from Miguel Serrata Rodr\u00edguez.16 Lastly, on March 29, 2011, 18,582.99 square meters were purchased from Ana Lidia Rodr\u00edguez Serrata.17 Until the initial denial of their expansion request in 2011 they continued to acquire lands for Phase 2.18\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 99(m). As the Claimants explain, after a series of transactions between 2004 and 2008, on May 12, 2010, the Claimants received an official Dominican land title for 147,005.78 square meters of their Phase 2 land, **Exhibit C-105**. Additionally, the Claimants had acquired 22,255.04 square meters from Federico Abreu, on June 25, 2007, **Exhibit C-106** ; and 31,350 square meters from Wilson Duran on September 15, 2009, **Exhibit C-107**.\n\nReply Memorial, footnote 110; Promissory land purchase deed in favor of Jamaca de Dios Jarabacoa S.R.L. for 45,000 square meters (January 7, 2011), **Exhibit C-108**.\n\nReply Memorial, footnote 110; Land purchase deed in favor of Jamaca de Dios Jarabacoa S.R.L. for 9,900 square meters (January 14, 2011), **Exhibit C-109**.\n\nReply Memorial, footnote 110; Land purchase deed in favor of Jamaca de Dios Jarabacoa S.R.L. for 15,000 square meters (February 9, 2011), **Exhibit C-110**.\n\nReply Memorial, footnote 110; Land purchase deed in favor of Jamaca de Dios Jarabacoa S.R.L. for 18,500 square meters (March 29, 2011), **Exhibit C-111**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 22; Report JDD Property All Purchases, **Exhibit C-31**.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimants hold that it was their plan to create a community where private individuals could purchase land and build luxury mountain homes, and where domestic and international tourists could stay in a boutique spa hotel high on the mountain, while enjoying recreational and other activities, such as hiking trails, organic gardens, parks and common areas. The Ballantines intended that homeowners and local citizens could also enjoy first-class dining with striking views of the valley.19\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 23.\n\n60.\n\nJamaca de Dios was intended to have at least two development phases. In Phase 1, the lower portion of the property would be developed to create the infrastructure necessary to develop the entire mountain and more than 90 individual parcels would be sold to private buyers to build luxury homes and a restaurant, which would be \"*a focal point of the complex*\".20\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 24; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 19.\n\n61.\n\nIn Phase 2, the Project would be expanded by extending the road further up the mountain and by subdividing the upper portion of the property.21 The Claimants also planned for the construction of a luxury hotel and spa with a second restaurant, mountain-lodge style apartments, and a larger apartment complex closer to the base of the property.22\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 25.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 25; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 95.\n\n62.\n\nBy the summer of 2009, after Phase 1 was approved and more than 90 individual luxury parcels were subdivided, the Claimants owned \"*more than 162,000 square meters of titled property further up the mountain*\" and were in the process of acquiring an additional 220,000 square meters for further development.23\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 26.\n\n63.\n\nThe Baiguate National Park was created by Presidential Decree No. 571-09, published on August 7, 2009 (the \"**National Park Decree**\"), to protect the *Salto Baiguate* or Baiguate waterfall, the endangered walnut trees and the forests along the river (the \"**National Park**\"). By the time the National Park Decree was published, less than half of the land associated with Phase 2 had been purchased by the Claimants.24\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 105; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 140; Claimants' Table of Jamaca de Dios Land Purchases (undated), \u00a7 III, **Exhibit C-31**.\n\n64.\n\nThe enactment of the National Park Decree was the culmination of a nation-wide environmental protection initiative which began in October 2004.25 From August 2008 to August 2009, Prof. Eleuterio Mart\u00ednez led a team of government officials, scientists and cartographers in identifying new areas for environmental protection, by relying on existing information and comparing it with information obtained from field visits, to see whether the area should be recommended for protection to a high-level advisory panel. The National Park Decree established 32 new protected areas, including the National Park.26\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142; Witness Statement of Eleuterio Martinez, \u00b6\u00b6 24-29.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 144-145; Witness Statement of Eleuterio Martinez, \u00b6\u00b6 33-36; Decree No. 571-09, (August 7, 2009) (as published in the Official Gazette No. 10535 dated September 7, 2009), **Exhibit R-77**.\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the area where the National Park is located was important for two reasons. First, because it has a sensitive and highly-fragile flora and fauna biodiversity. Second, \"*for the preservation of ecosystemic services, especially in relation to the production and protection of water in order to avoid potential landslides, given the intense annual dry and rainy seasons*\".27 Additionally, the Baiguate waterfall was also protected for being a bathing site and holding special rituals, known to the native Taino culture. For the same reasons, the river source and tributaries were included within the National Park's boundaries. According to Prof. Mart\u00ednez, protecting the river source and tributaries would not only protect the Baiguate waterfall but also the biodiversity in the neighboring Mogote mountain system.28 During that time, the team did not consider who owned the land or what they intended to do with it.29\n\nWitness Statement of Eleuterio Martinez, \u00b6 42.\n\nDecree No. 571-09, Art. 14, **Exhibit R-77** ; Witness Statement of Eleuterio Mart\u00ednez, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.\n\nWitness Statement of Eleuterio Mart\u00ednez, \u00b6\u00b6 33-46.\n\n66.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent does not agree with the distinction proposed by the Claimants, since the Phase 1/Phase 2 dichotomy both confounds and oversimplifies the issues at stake.30 According to the Respondent, the Phase 1/Phase 2 contrast is sometimes used by the Claimants to make a geographic distinction, while at other times it is used to make a temporal one.31 Thus, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' proposed nomenclature, and instead identifies five projects (each, a \"**Project**\"), distinguishable according to where the Projects are located and at what time they were pursued.32\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 71.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 72-74.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 75.\n\n67.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Project 1 was supposedly a reforestation project, for which permission was sought on December 28, 2004, to build an access road.33 Project 2 was the construction of the restaurant Aroma de la Monta\u00f1a, a housing development on the lower portion of Jamaca de Dios.34 Project 3 included plans to extend Project 1's road, expand Jamaca de Dios further up the mountain, sell at least 70 additional lots for luxury private homes, and the construction of a boutique hotel. However, when the Claimants sought permission from the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (the \"**MMA**\") for the project, it was described as the construction of 10 cabins and 19 villas.35 This is the project that the Claimants twice sought reconsideration for, and, as a result, they received three denials.36 In the last of these denials, the MMA finally referred to the existence of the Baiguate National Park.37 Project 4 is the mountain lodge that the Claimants sought to build above the restaurant Aroma de la Monta\u00f1a.38 Lastly, Project 5 refers to an apartment complex for which the Claimants never sought permission.39\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 77.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 78.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 79.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 80-83.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 83.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 84.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 85.\n\n**B. SEEKING APPROVAL FROM THE MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHASE 1**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimants sought to acquire the approval from the MMA for the Project. However, before that, in October 2004, the Claimants signed an agreement with PROCARYN, a German non-profit, to plant 50,000 trees across the property to stabilize the environment and create a \"*more enticing setting for the home sites they intended to create*\".40 In this sense, the Claimants sought permission from the MMA's Forestry Department to build a road to facilitate the reforestation plan. It was the Claimants' opinion that the road was critical for the Project, and they attempted to build one never before done by a private enterprise in the Dominican Republic.41\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 28; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 13; Agreement with Procaryn, **Exhibit C-32**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 121-122; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\n69.\n\nOn December 28, 2004, the Claimants wrote to the MMA seeking permission to build an access road for the reforestation plan.42\n\nRequest to Build Reforestation Access Road (December 28, 2004), **Exhibit C-33**.\n\n70.\n\nOn January 18, 2005, the MMA granted permission to cut a road and plant the trees.43 The MMA added that it had no objection as long as no trees were cut, removed and/or transplanted, nor any sand or gravel was extracted or transported.44 The road was completely built within the Claimants' development to be a service entrance for Jamaca de Dios. The Claimants allowed the landowners to the west of Jamaca de Dios to use this road until 2011, as it was much safer and more convenient than the historic pathway, which did not allow the passage of vehicles.45\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 29; Road Application (December 28, 2004), **Exhibit C-33** ; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 14; Road Application (January 18, 2005), **Exhibit C-34**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 77; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 123; Ministry's Response to the Request to Build Reforestation Access Road (January 18, 2005), **Exhibit C-34**.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 232; Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.\n\n71.\n\nDuring the road construction, the Claimants spent significant sums of money on heavy equipment, fuel and earth moving, which involved finding \"*large deposits of rock and road grade material in varying place*[s] *throughout the mountain*\" and then using \"[t]*his material* [\u2026] *for backfill, engineered support structures, road base, and drainage channels*\".46 According to the Respondent, these kind of actions were in violation of the conditions set out in the permit.47\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 16.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 124.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants sough the permit from the MMA in accordance with the procedure established in the *Ley General sobre Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (Ley No. 64-00)* (the \"**Environmental Law**\"). To this effect, the Claimants hired Antilia Environmental Consultants, a Dominican environmental company, to assist them with the permit request.48\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 35; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 32; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 133; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 18.\n\n73.\n\nIn short, the procedure to request an environmental permits is divided into six steps. First, the applicant must obtain a \"no objection\" letter from the municipal government where the proposed project is to be located. Second, this letter must be provided to the MMA, and the MMA would provide \"terms of reference\" for the submission of a *Declaraci\u00f3n de Impacto Ambiental* (the \"**Environmental Impact Statement**\"). The Environmental Law does not contain a comprehensive list of all the factors that must be taken into account for the Environmental Impact Statement.49 Third, to provide the terms of reference, the MMA must conduct a technical visit to the site of the proposed project. Fourth, the applicant must draft and submit the Environmental Impact Statement. Fifth, the MMA reviews the Environmental Impact Statement and prepares a technical report on the proposed project through its *Comit\u00e9 T\u00e9cnico de Evaluaci\u00f3n* (the \"**Technical Evaluation Committee**\"). Lastly, based on the technical report, the Environmental Impact Statement, and any stakeholder or public comments, the MMA issues a decision granting or denying the permit for the proposed project.50\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 130; Environmental Law, Article 117, **Exhibit R-3**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 31. *See*, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 127.\n\n74.\n\nThus, the Claimants requested a \"no objection\" letter from the City Council of the Municipality of Jarabacoa. On February 7, 2005, the \"no objection\" letter was later provided to the MMA, and the Claimants requested the terms of reference for the Environmental Impact Statement.51 The MMA conducted a technical visit to Jamaca de Dios and some MMA technicians observed, *inter alia*, the irregular topography of the land, with steep slopes increasing land erosion, and the fact that a road was under construction. The last issue was investigated and flagged for further review. The technicians recommended that the Environmental Impact Statement should focus on the topographic survey of the access road.52\n\nLetter from M.

In June 2007, the MMA asked the Claimants to redo it, and for which Antilia Environmental Consultants committed to develop a more thorough study.55\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 133; Letter from MMA to Michael Ballantine (August 18, 2006), p. 2, **Exhibit C-36**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 134; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 33; Letter from Michael Ballantine to Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez (February 7, 2005), **Exhibit C-35** ; Letter from Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez to Michael Ballantine (August 18, 2006), **Exhibit C-36** ; Letter from Michael Ballantine to Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez (February 14, 2007), **Exhibit C-37**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 134; **Exhibit C-37** ; Letter from MMA to Michael Ballantine (June 15, 2007), p. 1, **Exhibit R-64**.\n\n76.\n\nIn August 2007, the Claimants submitted a revised study. The Technical Evaluation Committee completed its technical report of the proposed Project. On December 7, 2007, the MMA issued the permit No. 0649-07 for the development of the lower portion of the Project. The permit included an obligation to submit an environmental compliance report every six months (each, an \"**EC Report**\") and the assumption of liability for any penalties due to causing any environmental harm. The permit also stated that a new Environmental Impact Statement would be required for any substantial modification or addition, or for any construction site.56 At the time, the Claimants were living in the United States and managing the process from there.57\n\nReply to the Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 15; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 136; **Exhibit C-4**, pp. 6-7.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 34; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 135; Permiso Ambiental No. 0649-07 (December 7, 2007), **Exhibit C-4**.\n\n77.\n\nDuring this process, the Claimants allege that the MMA did not indicate that the slope in the mountain of the Ballantine's property was an issue of concern, \"*or that any portion of the land in Phase 1 could not be developed because it exceeded the slope limitations set forth*\"58 in the Environmental Law. The Claimants and the MMA had a \"*constructive relationship*\" during the establishment and initial development of Jamaca de Dios.59\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 35.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 36. *See*, Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 4.\n\n78.\n\nAfter the approval of Phase 1, the MMA conducted annual inspections on Jamaca de Dios to ensure environmental compliance, reviewed the semi-annual reports submitted by Jamaca de Dios in accordance with Dominican law, and exchanged communications on several topics.60\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 36.\n\n**C. THE CLAIMANTS' ALLEGED COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF PHASE 1 OF THE PROJECT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Claimants developed the infrastructure necessary to support Phase 1 and the future Phase 2: networks to supply electricity, high-speed Internet, and potable water throughout the property; they hired 24-hour security and maintenance; created recreational and other common areas.61 The Claimants invested in designing and building a \"*high-quality, environmentally sound road throughout the complex*\".62\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 38; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 42.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 43.\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants explain that mountain roads are difficult to build and maintain. Since the Claimants understood the importance of a quality road for Jamaca de Dios, they invested time and money to create \"*the finest private mountain road in the Dominican Republic*\".63 They cleared and fully surveyed the mountain, analyzing potential routes with physical and computer modelling. Their claimed intention was to build a road that would avoid significant steepness, while still gaining altitude and allowing \"*exploitation of the flattest areas of the mountain for the development of premier home sites*\".64 The Claimants argue that they were \"*well-situated to make a simple extension of the road into Phase 2*\".65 They contend that much of the machinery necessary to build the road had been purchased and they also had in the mountain the raw material necessary for the road bed.66\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 45.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 46; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 11.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 47; Expert Report of Eric L.

Kay, \u00b6 12.\n\n81.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, despite the MMA's refusal to allow the expansion based on the slopes, the slopes in Phase 2 are more gradual than in Phase 1, thus, \"*the engineering necessary to duplicate the quality of the Phase 1 road would be less intensive*\".67\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 48; Expert Report of Eric L. Kay, \u00b6 12.\n\n82.\n\nAfter having established the necessary infrastructure during Phase 1, the Claimants subdivided the property into individual lots and began selling them to private purchasers through a standard sales contract. The landowners had the right to construct their own homes, subject to certain limitations imposed by Jamaca de Dios. The private purchasers were required to start constructing within two years of purchase and to finish in the following two years.68\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 49; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 22.\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimants also developed their restaurant, Aroma de la Monta\u00f1a. Since its establishment in May 2007, the Claimants state that Aroma de la Monta\u00f1a has increased in popularity as a dining destination for the residents of Jarabacoa and visitors from elsewhere.69\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 40; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 50; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 23-26.\n\n84.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, in less than five years, Jamaca de Dios became \"*the most popular and prosperous mountain tourism and residential project in the Dominican Republic*\", selling 75 lots between 2007 and 2011. By the time of the Statement of Claim, all of the lots had been sold and \"*the small remaining inventory consists of reacquisitions by Jamaca*\".70 The Claimants hold that more than 300 people were directly or indirectly employed in Jamaca de Dios, making it the largest development company in Jarabacoa.71\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 51; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 24.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 52.\n\n**D. THE CLAIMANTS' PLANS FOR PHASE 2 OF THE PROJECT**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nIn 2009, the Claimants commenced Phase 2 of their investment. Their intention was to sell at least 70 lots on the upper portion of Jamaca de Dios, which would have been more valuable that the properties in Phase 1 because of, *inter alia*, the views, the temperature, the enhanced privacy. Phase 2 would be accessed through an extension of the road that ended at the top of Phase 1. The Claimants also intended to build luxury homes in Phase 2.72\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 64-67; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\n86.\n\nAt the beginning of 2011, the Claimants conducted an expansion of Aroma de la Monta\u00f1a, from 90 to 225 available seats. They also installed a rotating floor in the main dining room, something unique in the Caribbean. The Claimants allege that the expansion was undertaken solely because they anticipated an increasing number of owners and visitors which Phase 2 would attract.73 The Respondent argues the expansion was in 2012 and that it was unauthorized, violating the terms of the Project 2 permit. The only license the Claimants had received for Aroma de la Monta\u00f1a was a restaurant operating license, granted in May 2014 by the Ministry of Tourism. This license still obliged the Claimants to seek the other permits, licenses and authorizations.74\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 68; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 26. *See* also, Restaurant Expansion Report, **Exhibit C-48**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 152; Email from L.

They engaged an architect to design it and a Taino Indian expert to ensure the cultural appropriateness of the hotel design and decoration.75 Additionally, they also planned to construct a mountain lodge at the top of Phase 1. ProHotel, one of the Claimants' consultants, undertook an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the project. Among the threats, they identified the disruption of the flora and fauna and to the environment. ProHotel recommended to first obtain financing and the permits for the mountain lodge. Only then would a marketing and sales plan be developed, a construction company be hired, and advertising be conducted.76 Instead \u2013 the Respondent points out \u2013 the Claimants hired a Dominican architect to design the lodge, began a marketing campaign, and even took client deposits for units at the mountain lodge.77\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 69; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 37.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 205-206; Jamaca de Dios Development Plan, ProHotel International Inc., pp. 8-10, **Exhibit R-257**.\n\n*See*, Mountain Lodge Transactions, **Exhibit R-260**.\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimants explain that they also planned to build an apartment building to host larger families, near the base of the complex. As a result, they had established a management company to oversee rental programs for these apartments.78\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 72; Witness Statement of Wesley Proch, \u00b6 9; Design for Apartment Complex, **Exhibit C-51** ; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 38.\n\n**E. ISSUES WITH THE ROAD**\n---------------------------\n\n89.\n\nBy 2011, at the end of the road the Claimants added gates for their property. Immediately after the gates' construction, the Claimants offered the Rodr\u00edguez family, the ones using the road built in 2005, to instead drive through the main Jamaca road.79 According to the Claimants, the Rodr\u00edguez family was not happy with being unable to keep using the road that the Claimants built in 2005. Thus, the Rodr\u00edguez requested the District Attorney to have the gates opened.80 However, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants built the gates at the end of a historic, public, unpaved road that had been used by the Palo Blanco townspeople for more than 80 years. In August 2011, the Palo Blanco townspeople requested the local District Attorney to have the gates to the historical road opened.81\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 233; Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 14.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 234.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130; *See*, Certification from *Alcalde de Palo Blanco* (May 22, 2013), **Exhibit R-92** ; Final Judgment on Recognition of Easement and Removal of Gates, *Sala Tribunal de Tierras Jurisdicci\u00f3n Original-La Vega* (October 5, 2015), pp. 11-12, **Exhibit C-69**.\n\n90.\n\nIn September 2011, the District Attorney rejected the request to demolish the gates.82 The Respondent alleges that the District Attorney decided in favor of the Claimants because they offered the townspeople to use their road to access their land.83 Despite this ruling, the Claimants continued allowing residents to use the main Jamaca road but requiring them to register the first time they entered the development. The Claimants state that night-time traffic was dissuaded for security reasons, but with advanced permission evening access was allowed.84\n\nResoluci\u00f3n de Inter\u00e9s Judicial (September 13, 2011), **Exhibit C-22**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 130; *See* **Exhibit C-22**.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 236; Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 15.\n\n91.\n\nOn April 17, 2013, the townspeople raised a complaint at a Municipality of Jarabacoa town hall meeting, which was also attended by Jamaca de Dios' representatives.

The MMA officials contended that by creating access to Jamaca de Dios, flattening a small space on three lots and removing several small trees, environmental regulations had been violated.103 Mr. Ballantine recalls that Ms. Francis Santana, the then-MMA local director, said that this type of unannounced, militaristic inspection was unprecedented and unique. Also, Mr. Ballantine claims that Ms. Santana told him that she had no knowledge of any complaint having been lodged against Jamaca de Dios. According to Mr. Ballantine, Ms. Santana stated that the inspection had been ordered by the Minister of the MMA, Mr. Jaime David Mirabal.104\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 81; Witness Statement of Zuleika Salazar, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 44-46.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 82; Witness Statement of Zuleika Salazar, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 44-46.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 83; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 45.\n\n100.\n\nWhile the Respondent confirms the inspection occurred, it explains that the visit was not unannounced because the Project 2 license gave the MMA the right to sanction any violations thereof. Thus, it contends that the MMA also had the power to monitor the license's compliance. Several weeks before the inspection, the Claimants were invited to the MMA's office in Jarabacoa to discuss unauthorized work conducted in connection with Project 2. During the meeting, the Claimants stated that they intended to comply with the principles of environmental protection and not to violate the Environmental Law.105 The Respondent does not consider the visit to be unprecedented because it characterizes the evidence as purely hearsay, denied by Ms. Santana herself, and the Environmental Law obliges permit-holders to allow the monitoring by the relevant authorities.106 Nor does the Respondent consider the inspection to have been militaristic because it is common for the National Service for Environmental Protection (\"**SENPA**\") to accompany MMA officials during their site visits. They wear distinctive green uniforms and carry non-automatic weapons. Although the Respondent cannot confirm whether the SENPA officials were present during the inspection, it does not consider it surprising if they were.107\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 112; Letter from Francis Santana to Jamaca de Dios (April 16, 2009), **Exhibit R-68** ; Minutes of Environmental Inspection (May 22, 2009), p. 4, **Exhibit R-65**.\n\nWitness Statement of Francis Santana, \u00b6 13; Environmental Law, Art. 45(4) **Exhibit R-3** ; Project 2 Permit, p.6, **Exhibit C-4**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 114; Witness Statement of Jaime David Fernandez Mirabal, \u00b6 22; Decree 561-06, Article 2 (November 21, 2006) **Exhibit R-162**.\n\n101.\n\nIn the inspections conducted on May 22, 2009, it was discovered that the Claimants (i) had failed to submit the EC Reports, (ii) had cut certain tree species without authorization, (iii) had engaged in unauthorized ground excavations which interfered with the waterways, and (iv) had divided the lots in a manner different to the development plans the MMA had authorized.108\n\nMinutes of Environmental Inspection (May 22, 2009), **Exhibit R-65** ; Letter from MMA to Michael Ballantine (September 22, 2009) and Report of Environmental Inspection (including photographs of land excavations and cut trees) **Exhibit R-66** ; Resolution SGA No. 973-2009 (November 19, 2009), **Exhibit C-7**.\n\n**2. Imposition of the Fine and Meetings between the Parties**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nOn November 19, 2009, on the basis of this inspection, the MMA imposed a fine of almost one million Dominican Pesos on Jamaca de Dios.109 According to the Claimants, this has been the largest fine the MMA has ever imposed in the region to a property owner, and local MMA officials allegedly confessed to them that they considered it \"*excessive and arbitrary*\".110 The Respondent denies this. According to the Respondent, the fine was imposed within the scope of the MMA's authority since the Project 2 permit reserved the MMA the right to impose fines for breaches of the permit.111 The MMA also required that the Claimants comply with environmental regulations, undo the environmental damage, suspend work on Project 2 until the fine had been paid, and submit reports proving their compliance every six months.112\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 84; Reply Memorial, para 181; Resoluci\u00f3n SGA No. 973-2009 (November 19, 2009), **Exhibit C-7**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 84.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 115.\n\nEnvironmental Permit No. 0649-07 (Dec. 7, 2007), **Exhibit C-4**.\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent explains that the quantity of a fine can be up to 3,000 times the minimum wage applicable at the time of the violation.113 The Respondent notes that the fine, even before it was reduced by 50%, was not the largest one imposed in the region. In 2013, Aloma Mountain, for example, received a fine of 1.7 million Dominican Pesos.114\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 115.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 138; Environmental Law, Art. 167, **Exhibit R-3** ; C\u00e1lculo Sanci\u00f3n Administrativa, Residencial Jamaca de Dios (July 10, 2009), p. 8, **Exhibit R-66;** Resoluci\u00f3n SGA No. 973-2009 (November 19, 2009) **Exhibit C-7**.\n\n104.\n\nThe fine also included an order to complete an EC Report twice every year, which the MMA asserted to be required by law. The Claimants contend that they have submitted the EC Reports for all 15 semi-annual periods but that no Dominican-owned project has been required to do so.115 The Claimants allege that the only EC Reports submitted to the Respondent \u2013 other than those submitted by the Claimants \u2013 were three from Paso Alto between 2008 and 2009, and one from Quintas del Bosque in 2014.116 The Respondent states that the obligation to submit EC Reports can also be found in environmental permits granted to other entities, and that fines have been imposed on other developments for not submitting the required EC Reports.117\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 85; First Expert Report of Graviel Pe\u00f1a, \u00b6 28.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 181; Second Expert Report of Graviel Pe\u00f1a, \u00b6 8.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 117; Fine On Estaci\u00f3n de Servicios Reyna Dur\u00e1n (January 10, 2017) **Exhibit R-72**, in which a fine of RD$ 245,640.00 was imposed on a Dominican owned project.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they immediately requested a meeting with the MMA Minister Jaime David Mirabal to discuss the fine. However, the MMA did not respond to the meeting request and refused to discuss or reconsider the fine.118 The Claimants refused to pay it and kept requesting a meeting.119\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 86; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 46.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 86; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 46.\n\n106.\n\nIn August 2010, before seeking permission, the Claimants applied for tax-free status for Phase 1 and 2, in accordance with CONFOTUR Law No. 158-01, which intends to promote tourism in the Dominican Republic. On November 10, 2010, the Respondent approved the provisional tax-exemption request.120 The Claimants point out that this approval was signed by the Dominican Ministries of Tourism, Culture, and Tax, and the MMA, the latter without mentioning the slope restrictions or the establishment of the National Park.121 The Respondent explains that this process has nothing to do with the environmental permit process and CONFOTUR informed so to the Claimants in the approval.122\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 73; Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 96-97; CONFOTUR Provisional Approval (November 10, 2010), **Exhibit C-52**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 74; CONFOTUR Provisional Approval (November 10, 2010), **Exhibit C-52**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 157; CONFOTUR Provisional Approval (November 10, 2010), p. 3, **Exhibit C-52**.\n\n107.\n\nOn September 22, 2010, the environmental consultant working with the Claimants on the planned expansion told them that some of their land was within the National Park, a category II protected area.123 Mr. Ballantine asked what that would mean for their expansion plans. The consultant confirmed that Dominican law allowed projects of low-impact tourism, such as nature tourism or ecotourism, within the protected areas, and specifically referred to the Claimants' project as one of those allowed. While the consultant recognized that the issue of the roads and the management of sewage and waste would have to be discussed, she recommended the Claimants request the terms of reference for their expansion and allow the MMA to visit the development to provide an opinion on technical and legal matters and on the projects' viability. Although \u2013 in the opinion of the consultant \u2013 the project was considered a permitted activity within a category II protected area, the consultant clarified that MMA would still decide which project would or would not be allowed.124 The Respondent emphasizes that neither Project 3, nor any part of Jamaca de Dios has been recognized as ecotourism by the MMA.125\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 99(1), 191; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 153; Email from M.

The approval included a signature and seal from the MMA, which made no reference to any slopes in Phase 2.130 The Respondent points out that CONFOTUR's granting of the tax benefit is unrelated to the Claimants' compliance with environmental regulation.131 The resolution granting the tax benefits states that it \"*does not authorize the commencement of construction of the JAMACA DE DIOS project*\".132\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 99(n), 191; **Exhibit C-52**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 157.\n\n**Exhibit C-52**.\n\n112.\n\nOn January 26, 2011, the Claimants' request for an environmental permit was lodged at the MMA.133 At the same time, the Claimants continued to purchase land and made plans to buy excavators.134\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 99(n); **Exhibit C-5**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 161; Email from Eric Kay to Michael Ballantine (January 17, 2011), **Exhibit R-268** ; Witness Statement of Wesley Proch, \u00b6 6.\n\n113.\n\nOn February 1, 2011, the Claimants decided to pay the fine, since the MMA previously stated that it would not provide the requested terms of reference until the fine was paid.135\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 87; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 49.\n\n**3. First Reconsideration by the MMA at the Claimants' Request**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nOn February 14, 2011, the Claimants were granted a meeting with the MMA Minister, Mr. Jaime David Mirabal, the Vice Minister of Protected Areas, Mr. Bernab\u00e9 Ma\u00f1\u00f3n, and the Management Director of Protected Areas, Mr. Ekers Raposa.136 In the meeting, Mr. Ballantine expressed his opinion that the fine was unjustified but he still was looking forward to working with the MMA regarding Phase 2.137 According to the Claimants, Minister Mirabal promised to send another inspection team to Jamaca de Dios to investigate the issue and provide a response on the requested expansion. However, there was no mention of the planned expansion being within the boundaries of the National Park.138 Mr. Omar Rodr\u00edguez was also present at the meeting.139\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 99(o); Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 54.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 88; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 51.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 88; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 52; Witness Statement of Omar A.

The team was welcomed by Mr. Ballantine and Mr. Eric Kay, the expert who helped design and construct the road of Phase 1 and the development of Phase 2. The Claimants contend that the team was \"*overwhelmingly positive about the prospects of expansion, never mentioning any issue about slopes or the fact that Phase 2 purportedly*\" was inside the National Park.140 The lead inspector of the MMA team, Mr. C\u00e9sar Sena, allegedly recommended seeking permission to expand the road into Phase 2.141\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 89; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 54-55; Expert Report of Eric L. Kay, \u00b6 11.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 90.\n\n116.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, during the February, 2011, site visit the MMA officials took contemporaneous notes that the land was over 40% steep, that the earth movements that would be carried out were major, and that the area provided for the disposal of removed materials was \"[i]*nadequate/harmful to the environment*\". The MMA officials further noted there were risks that (i) the project would significantly contaminate the soil and subsoil, (ii) during the construction phase the primary or secondary forest would be cleared, (iii) the project would have \"*a very strong adverse visual impact on the landscape*\", and (iv) a slope greater than 60% had been observed.142 The Respondent relies on Mr. Zacar\u00edas Navarro to explain that the construction of the road was dangerous and complicated, as it was planned to be done at an area located between 900 to 1200 meters above sea level, in the northern face of the Cordillera Central mountain range, where the precipitation levels exceed 1,600 millimeters per year. Also, there would have been a significant \"*risk of periodic and irrecoverable environmental harm*\".143 The MMA, its inspectors, and the Claimants agreed that because the Claimants' intention was to develop towards the top of the mountain and \"*it is virtually impossible to make the subdivision map without first cutting the road*\", the Claimants should first request permission for the construction of the road.144\n\nNotes from February 17, 2011 Site Visit, **Exhibit R-108**. The Respondent explains that slope incline, referred in Article 122 of the Environmental Law, is a technical term that refers to the distance between two points at different height but along the same horizontal plane. It can be expressed in degree or percentage. The percentage corresponds to the vertical distance over the span of 100 horizontal units, while the degree is calculated by applying an inverse tangent trigonometric function.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Zacar\u00edas Navarro, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 167; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 55; Letter from Michael Ballantine to Ernesto Reyna (February 24, 2011), **Exhibit C-53**.\n\n117.\n\nOn February 24, 2011, the Claimants wrote a letter to the Vice Minister of the MMA, Ernesto Reyna, seeking permission to begin the expansion of the road immediately.145\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 90; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 167; Letter from Michael Ballantine to Ernesto Reyna (February 24, 2011), **Exhibit C-53**.\n\n118.\n\nOn March 18, 2011, there was an inspection on Jamaca de Dios, conducted by an MMA official, Mr. S\u00f3crates Nivar, who purportedly drafted a report dated March 21, 2011.146 The MMA officials recommended declaring the project \"*not viable*\" because of the \"*environmental fragility of the area and natural risk, the land topography and slope, which is over 60% in much of the area, \u2026natural run-offs, the characteristics of the buildings being built in the Project area, and a possible violation of Art. 122, Law 64-00*\".147 According to the Claimants, a copy of the report was never provided to them until the Respondent's Response to the Notice of Arbitration.148\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 168; Site Visit Report (March 21, 2011), **Exhibit R-4**.\n\nSummary of Project 3 Evaluation Chronology (May 11, 2011), **Exhibit R-110**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 91; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 56; Zacar\u00edas Navarro, Proceso de c\u00e1lculo de pendiente para proyectos ubicados en espacios de altura (October 10, 2014), **Exhibit R-9**.\n\n119.\n\nOn April 21, 2011, the Claimants wrote to the MMA regarding the terms of reference.

Yet, the MMA was willing to assess the viability of any other areas that the Claimants would provide for Project 3.156 The Respondent points out that the Claimants failed to propose an alternative site.157 The Claimants point out that slope restrictions had never been mentioned by the MMA, even though the land approved in Phase 1 had slopes in excess of 60%.158\n\nLetter from Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez de Gutierrez to Michael Ballantine (September 12, 2011), **Exhibit C-8**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 172.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 97.\n\n127.\n\nNevertheless, after this rejection, the permit for Jarabacoa Mountain Garden and Mirador del Pino were approved, even though both developments would have slopes in excess of 60%.159 The Claimants contend that in those two projects the MMA worked with the owners \"*to modify their plans to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements*\".160 The Respondent explains that the Claimants oversimplify the issue when solely comparing the slopes of the properties. Other factors must be taken into account such as concentration, altitude and environmental impact. The other projects are located in lower altitudes, the access to exploitable land is much easier there and the concentration is much lower than in Project 3.161\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 98; Environmental Permission 1956-12, Mirador Del Pino (December 28, 2012), **Exhibit C-29** ; Environmental Permission 2245-13, Jarabacoa Mountain Garden (December 30, 2013), **Exhibit C-30**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 98; Technical Review Report of Jarabacoa Mountain Garden (2012), **Exhibit C-41** ; Letter from Zoila Gonzalez de Gutierrez to Santiago Canela Duran (July 25, 2012), **Exhibit C-42**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 125; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 182-186; First Witness Statement of Zacar\u00edas Navarro, \u00b6\u00b6 57-65.\n\n**4.

The map would show that the proposed development area does not have any slopes exceeding the 60% limit, revealing the denial's lack of substantive scientific support.163 However, the Respondent denies this, as five different site visits were conducted for the Project 3's permit, and measuring tools were used to analyze the slopes.164 By applying these factors, even Project 2 and 3 are different, albeit both have slopes exceeding 60%.

According to the Claimants, MMA did not provide any reports, findings or technical data supporting its rejection and no further inspection of the project was conducted.166 The Respondent points out that Mr. Ballantine's letter states that no slope would exceed 60 *degrees*, while acknowledging that the slope where the road would be constructed would be equivalent to 34 *degrees*.167\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 101; Letter from Michael Ballantine to Ernesto Reyna (November 2, 2011), **Exhibit C-10**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 139-141; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 177.\n\n131.\n\nIn contrast to the Claimants' allegation that no further site visit was performed, the Respondent contends that on January 23, 2012, the MMA's officials conducted another site visit.168 On February 22, 2012, the MMA organized a Technical Evaluation Committee meeting to support the rejection. Mr. Graviel Pe\u00f1a attended the meeting and stated that no technical issues were not discussed, instead only Zacarias Navarro's opinion was requested.169\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 123; *Informe de Supervisi\u00f3n Proyecto Ampliaci\u00f3n Jamaca de Dios, C\u00f3digo 6219* (January 23, 2012), **Exhibit R-105** ; Informe de Visita de An\u00e1lisis Previo (August 28, 2013), **Exhibit R-114**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 102; First Expert Report of Graviel Pe\u00f1a, \u00b6 11; Notes of *Comit\u00e9 T\u00e9cnico de Evaluaci\u00f3n*, evaluation of Phase 2 (February 22, 2012), **Exhibit C-94**.\n\n132.\n\nOn March 8, 2012, the Claimants' request for reconsideration was rejected.170 The MMA explained that the project was located in lots with slopes between 20 and 37 degrees, which would in turn mean slopes of 36% and 75%, respectively. The Environmental Law prescribes a maximum slope of 60%, not 60 degrees.171 Also, the MMA asserted that the project would modify the area's natural runoff and the local hydrological and the micro basin's condition, affecting the mountain's ecosystem. Additionally, the type of soil found on the site could only be used for certain purposes. The MMA had considered the Claimants' initial proposal improper, however it became concerned after finding out that their plan was even more ambitious and large than before. Thus, the MMA informed the Claimants that their application file had been closed.172\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 102; Letter from Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez de Guti\u00e9rrez to Michael Ballantine (March 8, 2012), **Exhibit C-11**.\n\nReply to the Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\n**Exhibit C-11**.\n\n133.\n\nOn March 3, 2012, Mr. Pe\u00f1a wrote to Mr. Reyna, informing of non-permitted development in Aloma Mountain.

The Respondent argues that Mr. Ballantine's letter to Jean-Alain Rodriguez was misleading and mischaracterized the issue because it stated that the Claimants had complied with the relevant provisions of the Environmental Law related to the construction of the road.176\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 193; Letter from Michael Ballantine to J.A.

Mr. Ballantine gave them a tour around Phase 2 and showed them the slope maps, part of the Empaca Redes report, and satellite images showing the unpermitted development of Aloma Mountain. Mr. Ballantine expressed his concern that Jamaca de Dios was being treated unfairly.186\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 109; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 65.\n\n144.\n\nOn September 13, 2013, Mr. Ballantine, his lawyer Mr. Mario Pujols, Ms. Miriam Arcia from Empaca Redes, and Ms. Leslie Gil Pe\u00f1a, the administrator of Jamaca de Dios, met with Mr. Zacar\u00edas Navarro, the MMA's Director of the Environmental Evaluation.187 Mr. Navarro informed Mr. Ballantine that the planned expansion was within the boundaries of the National Park. According to the Claimants, this was the first time the National Park had ever been mentioned by the MMA, in a written or oral communication.188\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 110; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 66; Witness Statement of Leslie Gil Pe\u00f1a, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 110; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 66; Witness Statement of Leslie Gil Pe\u00f1a, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\n145.\n\nOn September 23, 2013, Mr. Navarro visited Jamaca de Dios as part of the reconsideration appeal. He explained to the Claimants that even setting aside the slope and earth movement issues, the area for Phase 2 was within the National Park limits, and so the Project could not move forward.189\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Zacar\u00edas Navarro, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\n146.\n\nOn October 1, 2013, Mr. Ballantine sought redress from President Danilo's office. His requests for assistance were rejected.190 The Claimants note that an appeal made by Jarabacoa Mountain Garden to the President's office was treated differently: the Presidency directly intervened in the permitting process and the approval was granted for the entire process.191 However, the Respondent explains that the Presidency reviewed and forwarded the letter to the MMA on October 10, 2013.192\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 111; Letter from Michael Ballantine to President Carlos Pared Perez (October 1, 2013), **Exhibit C-60** ; Letter from President Danilo Diaz to Michael Ballantine (October 28, 2013), **Exhibit C-61** ; Letter from Carlos Pared Perez to Bautista Rojas G\u00f3mez (October 10, 2013), **Exhibit C-62**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 111; Witness Statement of Reynaldo de Rosario, \u00b6 9; First Expert Report of Graviel Pe\u00f1a, \u00b6 15.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 135; Letter from the Office of the Presidency to M.

The Claimants point out that the designation took place in August 2009 by the National Park Decree,198 yet the letter of January 2014 was the first one relying upon the existence of the National Park to deny Phase 2. Between 2009 and 2014, the Claimants and the MMA exchanged many written and oral communications, in which the National Park was never mentioned. In fact, the Claimants point out that the MMA extended the duration of the permit in Phase 1, despite the fact that a significant portion of it was inside the National Park.199 The Respondent explains that the final rejection was not based on the creation of the National Park, but rather that the National Park was an additional reason. The application had already been formally rejected on September 12, 2011 and the file was formally closed on March 8, 2012, when the Claimants opted to contest the decision rather than to choose an alternative location.200 The letter also reminded the Claimants that pursuant to Article 40 of the Environmental Law and to the environmental authorization regulations, any construction, extension, and/or renovation activities of a project cannot be performed if the corresponding environmental authorization has not been granted.201\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 112; Letter from Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez de Guti\u00e9rrez to Michael Ballantine (January 15, 2014), **Exhibit C-15**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 112; Letter from Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez de Guti\u00e9rrez to Michael Ballantine (January 15, 2014), **Exhibit C-15**.\n\nDecreto N\u00famero 571-09 (August 7, 2009), **Exhibit C-16**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 115.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 141; **Exhibits C-10, C-11 and C-13**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 196; Letter from Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez de Guti\u00e9rrez to Michael Ballantine (January 15, 2014), p. 2, **Exhibit C-15**.\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimants responded to the MMA's letter, dated January 15, 2014, asking the MMA the reasoning behind the National Park's boundaries, as there did not seem to be \"*any coherent environmental, geological, geographic, or altitude-related reason for it to have located the park lines through the middle of their development*\".202 They also asked the MMA to explain the reasons why the National Park Decree was now being applied to reject the Claimants' expansion permit, after being in force for more than four years.203\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 145.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 145; Letter from Michael Ballantine to Bautista Rojas G\u00f3mez (March 3, 2014), **Exhibit C-1**.\n\n151.\n\nIn November 2014, the Claimants met with Ms. Katrina Naut, Foreign Trade Director, and Ms. Patricia Abreu, Vice Minister for International Cooperation, to discuss the possibility of suspending the current proceeding.204\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 143; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 86.\n\n152.\n\nOn December 4, 2014, a community meeting was held to discuss the existence of the National Park and the creation of its management plan (the \"**Management Plan**\").205\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 124; Witness Statement of Leslie Gil Pe\u00f1a, \u00b6 45.

The City Council officials explained that they knew that the MMA was concerned about Jamaca de Dios' expansion and thus, they had asked the MMA for further information. The moment they received it, they would contact the Claimants to inform them of the City Council's position.206 During the meeting, the Respondent asserts that Ms. Leslie Gil Pe\u00f1a, a representative of the Claimants, verbally withdrew their request for a \"no objection\" letter, stating that it was unsuitable.207 The Claimants deny this, relying on the minutes of the meeting. According to the Claimants, Ms. Gil Pe\u00f1a explained that they were seeking first a conditional \"no objection\" letter, in order to continue pursuing the rest of the necessary permissions for the Mountain Lodge, and later they would request the definitive \"no objection\" letter.208\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 209; Jarabacoa City Council Meeting Minutes (December 11, 2014), p. 9, **Exhibit R-140** ; Witness Statement of Leslie Gil Pe\u00f1a, \u00b6 33.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 84; Jarabacoa City Council Meeting Minutes (December 11, 2014), p. 9, **Exhibit R-140**.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 226-228; **Exhibit R-140**.\n\n154.\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the MMA's Coordinator for Public Areas, Mr. Pedro Arias, acknowledged the local communities' frustration at finding out that their property was within the boundaries of the National Park.209 A draft map provided by the MMA at the community meeting explicitly shows that Jamaca de Dios and Aloma Mountain had been designated as ecotourism areas.210\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 124; Video of Pedro Arias' Comments (December 19, 2014), **Exhibit C-70**.\n\nSecond MMA Map of Baiguate National Park (December 4, 2014), **Exhibit C-63**.\n\n155.\n\nOn February 16, 2015, the City Council informed the Claimants that if they secured confirmation from the MMA that Project 4 would not give rise to environmental concerns, then the City Council would provide a \"no objection\" letter.

In the Management Plan, while ecotourism is allowed, the standard for what constitutes ecotourism has not been fully defined.212 The Respondent faults any delay in the drafting and issuance of the Management Plan on the limited resources the Dominican Republic has at its disposal to conduct the necessary studies to produce each Management Plan.213 In any event, the Respondent explains that under Law No. 202-04 on Protected Areas, in a land included under category II, like the National Park, ecotourism is allowed.214\n\nResolution No. 0010-2017*, Plan de Manejo del Parque Nacional Baiguate* (March 20, 2017), with *Plan de Manejo Parque Nacional Baiguate,* **Exhibit R-84**.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, 1042:5-1043:3 (English).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 142; Law No. 202-04, Ley Sectorial de \u00c1reas Protegidas, National Congress (July 24, 2004), **Exhibit C-71**.\n\n**IV. RELIEF SOUGHT**\n---------------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANTS' RELIEF**\n----------------------------\n\n157.\n\nIn their Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, the Claimants request that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\n(1) declare that Respondent has breached its obligations under the [DR-CAFTA] and international law;\n\n(2) award Claimants monetary damages of not less than US$20 million (twenty million U.S. dollars) in compensation for losses sustained as a result of Respondent's breaches of its obligations under the CAFTA-DR and international law, including, inter alia, reasonable lost profits, direct and indirect losses (including, without limitation, loss of reputation and goodwill), losses of all tangible and intangible property, and moral damages;\n\n(3) award all costs (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and all other professional fees) associated with any and all proceedings undertaken in connection with this arbitration, including all such costs undertaken to investigate this matter and prepare this Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, and all such costs expended by Claimants in attempting to resolve this matter amicably with Respondent before serving this Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim;\n\n(4) award pre- and post-judgment interest at a rate to be fixed by the Tribunal;\n\nand\n\n(5) grant such other relief as counsel may advise or the Tribunal may deem appropriate.215\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 94.\n\n158.\n\nIn their Amended Statement of Claim, the Claimants increased the monetary damages to USD 37.5 million deemed as direct damages, and added USD 4 million for moral damages.216 For their Reply Memorial, the Claimants' monetary damages, as calculated by their expert, Mr. Farrell, were re-assessed to total approximately USD 35.5 million.217\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 275-276.\n\nSecond Expert Report of Mr. Farrell, p. 15.\n\n159.\n\nIn their Admissibility Response, the Claimants request the Tribunal to grant the following relief: \"*dismiss the Respondent's admissibility and jurisdictional objection. The Tribunal should also order Respondent to pay the Ballantines' costs of defending against this Submission*\".218\n\nAdmissibility Response, \u00b6 112.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S RELIEF**\n------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nIn its Statement of Defense and its Rejoinder, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal grants the following relief:\n\na. That the Tribunal dismiss all of the Ballantines' claims, on the basis of lack of jurisdiction, inadmissibility, and/or lack of merit;\n\nb. That, in the event that it were to decide that one or more claims are meritorious, the Tribunal decline to grant any damages to the Ballantines, on the basis that their damages calculations are unreliable, erroneous, and/or speculative;\n\nc. That the Tribunal grant to the Dominican Republic all of the costs of the proceeding, as well as the full amount of the Dominican Republic's legal fees and expenses; and\n\nd. That the Tribunal award to the Dominican Republic such other relief as may deem just and proper.219\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 346; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 372.\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS ON JURISDICTION**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**1. The Dominican Republic's Consent**\n---------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants bear the burden of establishing the jurisdictional ground for their claims, including the Dominican Republic's consent.220 Its scope is defined in Article 10.17 of DR-CAFTA, which states that each Contracting Party \"*consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section* [B] *in accordance with this Agreement*\".\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 9; *Spence International Investments, LLC and others v. Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/2, Interim Award, (October 25, 2016), \u00b6 239, **Exhibit RLA-3** ; *Tulip Real Estate Investment and Development Netherlands B.V. v.

Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/7, Award (April 3, 2014), \u00b6 118, **Exhibit RLA-5** ; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 181:4-15 (English).\n\n162.\n\nArticle 10.16 explains which types of claims can be submitted to arbitration, by whom, and how. It provides that\n\n(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement; and\n\n(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and\n\n(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement; and\n\n(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.221\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.16, **Exhibit R-10**.\n\n163.\n\nThe Respondent focuses on two aspects. First, that only a claimant, as defined by DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 has the right to submit a claim to arbitration under Chapter 10, Section B. Second, that the only type of claim that can be submitted by a claimant is one according to which a respondent has breached an obligation under Articles 10.1 to 10.14. Accordingly, there is no consent if either the party submitting a claim to arbitration is not a \"claimant\" as defined by DR-CAFTA, or the claims asserted are not connected to the obligations set out in Articles 10.1 to 10.14. The Respondent argues that in this case neither the Ballantines are \"claimants\" under the purposes of the DR-CAFTA, nor do their claims involve any obligations under Articles 10.1 to 10.14, due to the fact that neither at the time they submitted their Notice of Arbitration, nor at the time of the alleged violations, their dominant and effective nationality was that of the U.S.222\n\nNotice of Preliminary Objection, \u00b6 7; Statement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 184:2-7 (English).\n\n**2. The Ballantines Do Not Qualify as \"Claimants\" Under DR-CAFTA**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants must demonstrate that at the time of the submission of their Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, on September 11, 2004, they qualified as \"claimants\" under the DR-CAFTA.223\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.16.4, **Exhibit R-10** ; Procedural Order No. 1, p. 9; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 184:19-22 (English).\n\n165.\n\nUnder Chapter 10 of the DR-CAFTA, \"claimant\" is understood as \"*an investor of a Party that is a party to an investment dispute with another Party*\".224 Therefore, in this case, the claimant must be an investor of a Contracting Party other than the Dominican Republic. An \"investor of a Party\":\n\nmeans a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party; provided, however, that a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality.225\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.28, **Exhibit R-10**.\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.28, **Exhibit R-10**.\n\n166.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the Claimants acknowledge that they have to comply with the definition of \"claimant\" under the DR-CAFTA, that the issue of whether they are \"claimants\" is connected to the question of their dominant and effective nationality, and they did not contest that September 11, 2014 was the day on which their claims were submitted to arbitration.226 However, the Claimants do question whether the date of submission is relevant in the first place.227\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 37.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 16-21; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 92:20-93:6 (English); Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 1227:20-23 (English).\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes the importance of the date of submission.228 First, it argues that should DR-CAFTA be silent on the relevant timing for the question of nationality, the Tribunal would be required to decide the issue on the basis of international law, in accordance with Article 10.22. Under international law, one of the relevant dates for purposes of jurisdiction is the date on which \"*the moving party avails itself of a remedy*\".229 Accordingly, jurisdiction must exist at the time the claim was filed, and at the time of the alleged treaty breach, and a State cannot be subject to claims raised by its own dominant and effective nationals before an international forum.230\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 36; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 186:5-7 (English).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 18; *Achmea B.V. v. Slovak Republic*, PCA Case No. 2013-12, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (May 20, 2014), \u00b6 267, **Exhibit RLA-19** ; Christoph H. Schreuer *et al.*, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2d. ed. 2009), Art. 25, \u00b6 36, **Exhibit RLA-20**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 104-106; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 1343:17-20 (English).\n\n168.\n\nSecond, it contends that in fact DR-CAFTA is not silent on this issue, but rather that it is connected to the issue of consent. The question is whether the Claimants were allowed to submit their claim at the time they did so. Thus, one would examine the state of affairs on the date of submission.231\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 19.\n\n169.\n\nThird, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertion232 that the issue of dominant and effective nationality only becomes relevant if the investor holds dual nationality at the time of making the investment in the host State. The definition of \"claimant\" in Article 10.28 would support the position that the relevant time period cannot be earlier than the time when the investment dispute arose.233\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, footnote 13.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 20.\n\n170.\n\nFourth, the Respondent alleges that even if the Tribunal were to focus on DR-CAFTA's definition of \"investor of a Party\", it would not find any support for the Claimants' claim that the question on the nationality refers to the date the investment was made. Article 10.28's definition of \"investor of a Party\" has two cumulative requirements: (i) there must be a \"national of a Party\"; and, (ii) the national must attempt to make, is making or has made an investment in the territory of another Party. The notion of dominant and effective nationality is only related to the first requirement. The Respondent does not contest that the second requirement is disjunctive, since it allows for three different options to define someone as an investor.234 However, if one would follow the Claimants' arguments not all the options would be relevant. Therefore, the Claimants' assertion must be rejected.235\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 185:7-20 (English).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 23; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 38-42.\n\n171.\n\nFifth, the Respondent considers the Claimants' assertion that the \"*Tribunal should not merely take a snapshot in time and, at any specific date, attempt to weigh [as of that date] the Ballantines' connections to the US against their connections to the DR*\",236 (Emphasis added by the Respondent) is misguided. Further, it points out that the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal's *Malek* decision the Claimants are relying on does not support such a contention.237\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 23.\n\n*Reza Said Malek v. Iran,* IUSCT, Interlocutory Award, (June 23, 1988), \u00b6 14, **Exhibit CLA-51**.\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent contends that because the Claimants held dual nationality at the time of the submission of their claims to arbitration, on September 11, 2014, the question is which nationality was the dominant and effective one at that time.238 The effective nationality refers to whether there is a genuine connection between the person and the State.239 The Respondent does not dispute the genuine connection between the Claimants and the United States, nor between them and the Dominican Republic. The dominant nationality refers to which nationality is stronger.240\n\nNotice of Preliminary Objection, \u00b6 11.\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment, (April 6, 1955), p. 22, **Exhibit RLA-6** ; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 1265:18-24 (English).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 45.\n\n173.\n\nSince the DR-CAFTA does not include any standard for determining it, the Respondent proposes to approach the question applying international law. The Respondent relies on case law from the International Court of Justice (the \"**ICJ**\"), the Italian-United States Conciliation Commission and the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal to argue that the adjudicator must take into account several factors, such as the State of habitual residence, the circumstances in which the second nationality was acquired, the subject's personal attachment for the country, and the center of a person's economic, social and family life.241 The Respondent notes that in Procedural Order No. 2 the Tribunal recognized these factors.242\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala)* Second Phase, ICJ, Judgment, (April 6, 1955)*,* p. 22, **Exhibit RLA-6** ; *United States v.

However, the fact that Ms. Lisa Ballantine went back to Northern Illinois University after she had visited Jarabacoa is relevant, mainly for the studies she decided to undertake.247 Ms. Lisa Ballantine decided to study ceramic filter manufacturing and the Dominican Republic's history to \"*create a social entrepreneurial startup that would focus on clear water*\" in Jarabacoa.248 Instead of indicating a connection with the United States, this fact points to the Dominican Republic.249\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 53.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 51; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 59.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6 2.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6 2.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 55.\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent considers it entirely irrelevant where the children were born, because the youngest one was born six years before they visited the Dominican Republic for the first time. Regarding the language being spoken at home, the Respondent considers it irrelevant that it was English, because the Claimants do not provide any authority to support their conclusion. In fact, the same can be said of their religious faith and practice.250\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimants also raise two additional factors, the laws regarding dual nationality in the United States and the Dominican Republic, and how both States viewed the Claimants.251 Yet, the Respondent argues that these factors do not support their position.252 Regarding their first factor, the Claimants supposedly argued that the Dominicans laws do not matter because Dominican authorities do not respect Dominican citizens and in any case, their Dominican naturalization only represented a \"*tenuous*\" connection since their citizenship could be taken away.253 The Respondent rejects these arguments stating that the laws apply irrespective of the private citizens' perceptions of them and their connection was anything but tenuous, thus the circumstances under which naturalization can be taken away are irrelevant here.254 Regarding the second factor, the Respondent argues that each State's opinion on which nationality was considered dominant is irrelevant, since neither of the two States had any knowledge that the Claimants had dual nationality.255\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 59-75.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 89.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 73-74.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 91.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 94-98.\n\n178.\n\nAccordingly, and considering the factors mentioned by the Claimants, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants' dominant and effective nationality was Dominican at the relevant times.256 The Claimants held their habitual residence in the Dominican Republic, they voluntarily applied for the Dominican citizenship, they had a deep personal attachment with the country and it was the center of their economic, social and family lives.257\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 59. Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 99.\n\nNotice of Preliminary Objection, \u00b6 13.\n\n179.\n\nAs mentioned above, Mr. Michael Ballantine and Ms. Lisa Ballantine were born in the United States and lived there until 2000, when they moved to the Dominican Republic for a year to work as missionaries.258 In 2001, they returned to Chicago but they continued to visit the Dominican Republic every year.259 In 2005, Mr. Ballantine announced to Ms. Ballantine his intention to sell his business in the U.S. and to invest all of their life savings to develop a tropical mountain in the Dominican Republic. The following year, they sold their home and many of their possessions and they moved to the Dominican Republic.260 On the same year, the Claimants acquired the \"permanent resident\" status, which was renewed in June 2008.261\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 18; Jamaca de Dios Website, \"History\" Page (last accessed January 24, 2017), **Exhibit R-11**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 20; Notice of Intent, \u00b6 11.\n\nGreg Wittstock, *A Man and His Mountain, A Woman and Her Heart* (February 27, 2013), **Exhibit R-12** ; Notice of Intent, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 12.\n\nCertificates of Permanent Residency of Michael and Lisa Ballantine, **Exhibit R-25**.\n\n180.\n\nTo be perceived as Dominicans by the Dominican government and their clients, the Claimants voluntarily decided to live in Jamaca de Dios and to become Dominican citizens.262 While the Claimants downplay this fact to a simple pledge to uphold the Dominican laws and constitution,263 the Respondent emphasizes their obligation to be faithful to the Dominican Republic. The Respondent argues that when a person voluntarily decides to acquire a second nationality, it is in itself an indication that the voluntarily acquired nationality has become the dominant one.264 As the ICJ in *Nottebohm* held\n\n[n]aturalization is not a matter to be taken lightly. To seek and to obtain it is not something that happens frequently in the life of a human being. It involves his breaking a bond of allegiance and his establishment of a new bond of allegiance.265\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 29, 88.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 88.\n\nUnited States Department of State, Office of the Legal Adviser, *Digest of United States Practice in International Law 1991-1999*, p. 36, **Exhibit RLA-10**.\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v.

Thereupon, the Claimants exercised their newly acquired nationality in various ways, such as: for travelling,269 for exercising their right to vote,270 for filing claims in Dominican courts, or for legal documents, such as contracts or powers of attorney.271 They also attended church in the Dominican Republic and sent their children to school there.272 They even used their Dominican nationality in 2010 to request the Dominican nationality for their youngest children.273 Although their children moved back to the United States for college, the Respondent relies on Ms. Tobi Ballantine's social media postings to show that she had a stronger connection with the Dominican Republic, than to the United States.274 Accordingly, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' contention that they never acted, felt or were ever perceived as Dominicans or that they were never politically, culturally or socially connected to the Dominican Republic.275\n\nMigratory Records for Michael Ballantine and Lisa Ballantine, **Exhibit R-19**.\n\nJarabacoa Voting Records, **Exhibit R-20** (while the Claimants voted in the 2012 election, they were also eligible for the 2016 election).\n\nHearing Minutes, La Vega Tribunal de Tierras (September 12, 2013), **Exhibit R-26** ; Hearing Minutes, La Vega Tribunal de Tierras (November 21, 2013), **Exhibit R-27** ; Notarial Promissory Note (February 8, 2011), **Exhibit R-228** ; Draft of Acknowledgement of Payment (March 18, 2011), **Exhibit R-229** ; Agreement to Reserve Apartment (December 8, 2013), **Exhibit R-227** ; Aroma de la Monta\u00f1a Power of Attorney (April 2, 2013), **Exhibit R-226**.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.\n\nJosiah and Tobi Ballantine Naturalization File, **Exhibit R-36**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 39; Tobi Ballantine's Twitter Feed (February 27, 2011), (May 20, 2012), (February 26, 2013), (July 1, 2016), (July 4, 2014), (October 21, 2015), **Exhibit R-78**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 57; Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 4.\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimants argue that their U.S. bank accounts kept more funds than their Dominican ones. Yet, this reflects activity in the Dominican Republic and the United States. Moreover, they had a separate U.S. bank account for Jamaca de Dios.276 The Respondent points out that the Claimants assert that they had invested all of their money in the Dominican Republic.277 Although the Claimants had opened a U.S. retirement and college savings accounts, the accounts were barely used.278 Furthermore, other sources confirmed that from 2006 onward, their assets were primarily located in the Dominican Republic.279 Their non-profit organizations, \"Jesus for All Nations\" and \"Filter Pure\", mainly operated in the Dominican Republic.280 Their U.S. tax returns stated the Claimants did not have a salary or earn wages during the relevant time period. If they earned income at that time, 70% came from their activity in the Dominican Republic, like interest payments from Jamaca de Dios.281 Thus, the Respondent states that the center of their economic life was the Dominican Republic.\n\nAccount Balance Summary, Jamaca de Dios (December 2010), p. 1, **Exhibit R-239**.

They had their own community there, which they designed to promote their vision of social life.282 At some point, they came to consider themselves as Dominican.283 In fact, when the Claimants moved back to the United States in the summer of 2015, they stated that they \"*have been gone for so long that I feel out of touch with american* [sic] *society. The culture is so different than when I left 10 years ago. I feel such a culture shock coming back*\".284 Indeed, the Claimants ended up claiming moral damages to the Dominican Republic in this arbitration for allegedly forcing them to sell their home and leave their friends and colleagues.285\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 42; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 23-24.\n\nJamaca de Dios Website, \"History\" Page (last visited January 24, 2017), (quoting Michael Ballantine as follows: \"This year in the Dominican Republic transformed our families and during that time we developed a deep love and passion for the people and culture of this beautiful [sic] island\"), **Exhibit R-11** ; Transcript of \"Nuria\" Report (June 29, 2013), p. 10 (quoting Lisa Ballantine as follows: \"We love the Dominican Republic, it is our country, I am Dominican now\u2026\"), **Exhibit C-25** ; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 322 (going so far as to claim moral damages for the fact that they allegedly \"were forced to sell their home and leave their friends and colleagues in the Dominican Republic\u2026\").\n\nLisa Ballantine's Facebook Profile Page (May 3, 2015), p. 109, **Exhibit R-37**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 322.\n\n185.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, U.S. law, case law and doctrine support a similar conclusion: that the Claimants' dominant and effective nationality at paramount times was the Dominican. In the *Sadat v. Mertes* case, the court held that the plaintiff's voluntary naturalization indicated that his dominant nationality was the one he acquired. Additionally, the fact that the plaintiff did not take all reasonable steps to avoid or quit his status as a U.S. national, was sufficient evidence of his continued, voluntary association with the U.S. and his intention to remain there.286 The U.S. State Department embraced the *Sadat* decision in the U.S. Digest on International Law (1991-1999).287\n\n*Sadat v.

The Ballantines' Claims Do Not Involve Obligations Under Articles 10.1 to 10.14 of DR-CAFTA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the second takeaway from Article 10.16 of the DR-CAFTA is that an arbitration is only permissible under the DR-CAFTA if the claim refers to obligations breached under Articles 10.1 to 10.14.302 The Claimants contend that the Respondent has breached its obligations under Articles 10.3 (National Treatment); 10.4 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment); 10.5 (Minimum Standard of Treatment); 10.7 (Expropriation and Compensation); and 10.18 (Transparency).303\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 60.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 15.\n\n190.\n\nAs a threshold matter, the Respondent points out that Article 10.18 is titled \"Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party\" \u2013 not \"Transparency\". The Respondent presumes that the Claimants refer to Article 18 but in that case, the claim exceeds the scope of the Respondent's consent to arbitration.304 The Claimants have amended their claims and state that it actually refers to a violation of Article 10.5 with Chapter 18 as a guide.305 The Respondent argues that the contents of Chapter 18 cannot be imported to Chapter 10 if the Contracting Parties did not provide for it. To do so would be going against the interpretative principle *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*.306\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 62; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 102.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 421.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 103.\n\n191.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, almost all of the claims are based on alleged State actions that supposedly took place between November 30, 2010 \u2013 when the Claimants requested permission from the MMA to expand Jamaca de Dios \u2013, and March 11, 2014 \u2013 six months after the events giving rise to the claim occurred.307 These claims exceed the scope of the Dominican Republic's consent because (i) its consent only applies to claims that hold that the Respondent breached an obligation under Articles 10.1 to 10.14; (ii) a State action can only be deemed to have breached an international obligation if the State is bound by it at the time the breach occurred; and (iii) at the time of the acts alleged by the Claimants, the Dominican Republic was not bound by the obligations invoked by the Claimants.308\n\nNotice of Preliminary Objection, \u00b6 30; DR-CAFTA, Article 10.16.3, **Exhibit R-10** ; Notice of Intent, \u00b6 22; Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 4.\n\nNotice of Preliminary Objection, \u00b6 31, Statement of Defense, \u00b6 64; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 104.\n\n192.\n\nAll the DR-CAFTA provisions invoked by the Claimants apply only to \"covered investments\" and \"investors of another Party\".309 The term \"covered investment\" is defined in Article 2.1 as an investment in the territory of one of the Contracting Party owned by an investor of another Contracting Party.310 In the present case, \"the investor of another Party\" is a person attempting to make, making or who has made an investment in the Dominican Republic and whose dominant and effective nationality is the U.S. nationality. Therefore, the Claimants have to demonstrate that their U.S. nationality was their dominant and effective nationality at the time the alleged illegal State conduct took place, in order to establish the Dominican Republic's consent to arbitration.311\n\nDR-CAFTA Articles 10.3, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.7, **Exhibit R-10**.\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 2.1, **Exhibit R-10**.\n\nNotice of Preliminary Objection, \u00b6 33; Statement of Defense, \u00b6 67; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 105-106.\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants' dominant and effective nationality through the relevant time period was Dominican. As a result, they cannot be considered U.S. investors; their investment does not comply with the definition of \"covered investments\"; the obligations invoked by the Claimants do not apply; and, therefore the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.312\n\nNotice of Preliminary Objection, \u00b6 34; Statement of Defense, \u00b6 69; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 108.\n\n194.\n\nAgain, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal must look at the nationality the Claimants held at the time they made their investment in the Dominican Republic.313 The Respondent rejects this allegation on the basis of the same arguments raised in the previous section.314 Previous investment arbitration tribunals have concluded that the date of an alleged treaty violation is a fundamental jurisdictional requirement.315 In *Pac Rim*, the tribunal held that under DR-CAFTA the nationality requirements must be fulfilled at the time of the alleged breach.316 Furthermore, Article 44 of the Articles on State Responsibility states that \"[t]*he responsibility of a State may not be invoked if: (a) the claim is not brought in accordance with any applicable rule relating to the nationality of claims*\".317\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 92:20-93:6 (English); Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 1227:20-23 (English).\n\n*See supra*, Section V.A.2.\n\n*Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas y Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber v.

THE CLAIMANTS' ARGUMENTS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claims Were Submitted in Accordance With DR-CAFTA**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimants do not debate the Respondents' arguments on the DR-CAFTA framework and \"*its foundation upon consent of the parties*\".318 They acknowledge that they have to comply with the DR-CAFTA definition of \"claimant\" in order to pursue relief for their claims.319\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 17; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 24.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 24.\n\n196.\n\nTheir claims were submitted (i) on their behalf under DR-CAFTA Article10.16(1)(a); and (ii) on behalf of their enterprises incorporated in the Dominican Republic, directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the Claimants under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16(1)(b). The Claimants own or control several Dominican enterprises such as Jamaca de Dios SRL, Aroma de la Montana, E.I.R.L., Pino Cipres Investments SRL, Pina Aroma Investments SRL, and Upper Dreams Investments SRL but they also have other ownerships and concessions.320 These investments qualify as such under Article 10.28.321\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 16-19, 22-23.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 159.\n\n**2. The Ballantines Qualify as \"Claimants\" Under the DR-CAFTA**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they have always been dominantly and effectively U.S. citizens.322 As mentioned above,323 they acknowledge that they have to comply with the DR-CAFTA definition of \"claimant\". As a result, they have to be investors of a Contracting Party, other than the Dominican Republic, attempting to make, making or who have made an investment in the Dominican Republic. The Claimants consider this a disjunctive definition and so, any of the three tenses can be used to determine who can be defined as a claimant.324\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 21.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 195.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 19; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 26.\n\n198.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal should only look at the nationality of the Claimants \"*as of the time that they made their investment in the Dominican Republic*\".325 (Emphasis omitted) According to the Claimants, the reference to \"dominant and effective nationality\" only becomes relevant if the investor has dual nationality at the time the investment was made. Since a great part of the land at issue in this arbitration was acquired by the Claimants well before they became Dominican citizens, they conclude that they have the explicit right under the DR-CAFTA to make their claims. Thus, these jurisdictional objections should fail.326\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 19; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 92:20-93:6 (English); Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 1227:20-23 (English).\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 19; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 27.\n\n199.\n\nEven if they have to establish that they were dominantly U.S. citizens at the time of submission of their Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants argue that they still would not be required to demonstrate that they were dominantly U.S. citizens during the time their claims arose. This would not be specifically required by DR-CAFTA and the provisions on dual nationality would be silent on the time frame of the evaluation. In any case, the Claimants consider it unnecessary to decide on the appropriate time frame for the evaluation of the dominant nationality, since the Claimants at all times have been dominantly and effectively U.S. citizens.327\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 16; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 21; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 1221:2-7 (English).\n\n200.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that for the purposes of Article 10.28 there is no test to decide which of the two nationalities should be considered dominant. DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 simply sets out a non-exhaustive list of qualified investments. The Claimants claim that their investments are listed in Article 10.28.328 By contrast, to determine which of the two nationalities should be considered dominant the Tribunal should resort to international law.329\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 157.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 60-62.\n\n201.\n\nThe Claimants hold that the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal's decisions the Respondent relies upon relate to entirely different circumstances and arise under an entirely different treaty. Thus, although they can provide guidance on the factors that should be considered in order to decide on the dominant nationality, they should not serve as precedents.330 The Claimants contend that the Respondent's interpretation of the factors is incomplete and too narrow in their timespan. In *Malek v. Islamic Republic of Iran*, the tribunal interpreted the *A/18* decision as requiring it to look at \"*the entire life of the [c]laimant, from birth*, *and all the factors which, during this span of time, evidence the reality and sincerity of the choice of national allegiance*.\"331 (emphasis added by the Claimants) Accordingly, the Claimants argue that the tribunal \"*need not merely take a snapshot in time and, at any specific date, attempt to weigh the Ballantines' connections to the US against their connections to the DR*\".332 The Tribunal should not only look at the time period between 2010 and 2014 \u2013 i.e. after the Claimants acquired the Dominican citizenship \u2013, but their entire life to determine whether they are more closely aligned with the United States or the Dominican Republic.333\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\n*Reza Said Malek v. Iran,* IUSCT, Interlocutory Award, (June 23, 1988), **Exhibit CLA-51**.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 23.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 34-36; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 32; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 58:5-9 (English).\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimants recognize334 that the Tribunal held in Procedural Order No. 2 the relevance of certain factors such as, \"*the State of habitual residence, the circumstances in which the second nationality was acquired, the individual's personal attachment for a particular country, and the center of the person's economic, social and family life*.\"335 Additionally, the Tribunal should consider other factors, *inter alia* : (i) the country of residence of the Claimants' entire family; (ii) where the Claimants went to college; (iii) where their children were born; (iv) the primary language spoken at home; (v) their religious faith and practice.336 In their Reply Memorial, the Claimants state additional factors: (i) the Claimants' motivation to become dual nationals, (ii) their entire life; which includes but is not limited to the facts at the relevant times; (iii) how they viewed themselves; (iv) how the United States and the Dominican Republic and their nationals viewed the Claimants; and (v) the laws regarding nationality in the two states.337\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 10.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, \u00b6 25.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 24; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 35.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 24; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 16.\n\n203.\n\nThe Claimants argue that this is not a treaty-shopping situation. The Claimants have always been U.S citizens, yet they acquired Dominican citizenship six years after they made their investment because they realized how Dominican officials treated foreigners. They maintained a residence in the Dominican Republic to supervise and develop their investment. However, they moved back permanently to the United States when they suffered the treaty violations by the Respondent.338 Since the Tribunal acknowledged, \"*that the same facts would necessarily have a bearing or would be relevant for both the procedural and the substantive determination*\",339 (emphasis added by the Claimants) the Claimants contend that the differential treatment received by the Claimants, compared to the treatment received by other Dominican investors, should be relied on when deciding whether they are dominantly U.S. or Dominican citizens.340\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 25; Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 33, 40.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, \u00b6 29.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 18.\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's approach to determine which nationality is the dominant and effective one. According to them, the Respondent's approach is legally and factually unsubstantiated. The *Nottebohm* opinion concerned the issue of diplomatic protection and whether one could rely upon a nationality which had been granted \"*in exceptional circumstances of speed and accommodation*\" and without a substantial bond, or the nationality with which it had a long-standing and close connection. The Respondent's reliance341 on the U.S. State Department report would also be incorrect because the case cited by the report supports the Claimants' position.342 The applicant in that case was found to be a U.S. national \u2013 despite residing in Egypt \u2013 because of his continued, voluntary association with the United States and his wish to remain a U.S. citizen.343 Yet, in this case the Claimants argue that there is no doubt about the Claimants' genuine and lifetime U.S. citizenship.344\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 51, 67, 72; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 190:8-13 (English); Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 1266:9-14 (English).\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 13.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 13.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, footnote 36.\n\n205.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the *Sadat v. Mertes* case was relied on by the Respondent to contend that the Claimants' voluntary naturalization in the Dominican Republic is proof of the dominant nationality by itself.345 However, the *Sadat* case is inapplicable because in that case the subject renounced any allegiance to foreign states when acquiring U.S. citizenship. In the Claimants' case, there was no such requirement to become Dominican citizens. Even if they did swear faith to the Dominican Republic, they did not renounce their U.S. citizenship.346\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, footnote 103; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 190:14-20 (English).\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 29; Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 72.\n\n206.\n\nThe Claimants obtained Dominican citizenship six years after making their initial land purchase in Jarabacoa in July 2004. Although at the beginning they intended to manage their investment from Chicago, later it became apparent that they needed to be present and they started to reside in the Dominican Republic from August 2006 onwards.347 For the Claimants, their choice to apply for the Dominican nationality was a business decision made as a result of the discriminatory treatment given by Dominican officials to foreigners, because of Jamaca de Dios' market conditions and to demonstrate their commitment to their investment.348\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 17; Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 1.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 155.\n\n207.\n\nThe Claimants state that the Respondent attempts to equate residency with dominant nationality. However, the Claimants contend that this is not the test. While the Claimants lived in the Dominican Republic, they always maintained at least one residence, or even two, in the United States:\n\na) From March 1, 1994 through August 18, 2011, the Ballantines owned a residence at 33w231 Brewster Creek Circle in Wayne, Illinois;\n\nb) On October 1, 2010 through December 31, 2011, the Ballantines rented a home at 1163 Westminster Avenue in Elk Grove Village, Illinois;\n\nc) On December 2, 2011, the Ballantines purchased a home at 850 Wellington Avenue, Unit 206, in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, and sold this home in November of 2015;\n\nd) on April 19, 2012, the Ballantines purchased a home at 3831 SW 49th Street, in Hollywood, Florida, and sold that home on March 28, 2014;\n\ne) on July 15, 2015, the Ballantines rented a home at 505 N.

The Claimants emphasize their deep connection to U.S. culture and society,354 while they were only connected with the Dominican Republic for commercial reasons.355\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 487:6-488:19 (English).\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 35; Procedural Order No. 25; Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 4; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 478:3-14 (English).\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimants allege that only initially was all their capital was invested in Jamaca de Dios. The funds for the investment originated from Mr. Michael Ballantine's work in the United States and their financial life remained always there.356 The Claimants have since 2004 filed individual federal income tax returns in the United States, while they did not do so in the Dominican Republic.357 They also maintained their U.S. checking bank account since 1996, a retirement account since 2009, U.S. health insurance cover since 2010 and separate credit cards issued in 1992 for Mr. Michael Ballantine and in 2012 for Ms. Lisa Ballantine.358 Additionally, they established college savings accounts for their children's college education.359 Regarding their U.S. non-profit organizations, the Claimants explain that \"Filter Pure\" was created in February 2008 and was directed by Ms. Lisa Ballantine until 2015.360 In contrast, the \"Jesus for All Nations\" was managed by them while they were Dominican nationals and they raised money and filed U.S. tax returns since at least 2010.361\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 34; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 70.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 11; Letter from Catalano, Caboor & Co, **Exhibit C-80**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 70; Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 12-15; Chase Account Confirmation for Account #1110017084988, **Exhibit C-81** ; Ameritrade Account Statements, **Exhibit C-82**.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 16.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 70; Filter Pure Inc., Articles of Incorporation (February 26, 2008), **Exhibit C-83**.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 34; Jesus For All Nations, Tax Return (2010), **Exhibit C-84**.\n\n211.\n\nWhile the Claimants recognize that they used the Dominican nationality as the Respondent states, the Claimants conclude that they were still at all times dominantly U.S. citizens.362 Between 2010 and 2014, the Claimants were in the United States 30 different times. Moreover, the Claimants assert that they solely used their Dominican passports when entering the Dominican Republic but they used their U.S. passports to enter elsewhere.363 The Claimants reject the Respondent's count of how much time the Claimants spent in the Dominican Republic and in the United States between 2010 and 2014. The amount of days in the Dominican Republic does not compare to the Claimants' personal, cultural, familiar, and social attachment to the United States.364\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 199.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 481:10-14 (English).\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 50.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants recognize that they built a house to promote their development and they lived there while they were in the Dominican Republic. However, the Claimants decided to put their home for sale in September 2012, to reduce the amount of time they were spending in the Dominican Republic.365\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 45.\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimants also resort to the educational paths taken by each of their four children to show the dominant connection between the Claimants and the United States. All of the Claimants' children attended college in the United States, even though at the time the Claimants were living in the Dominican Republic. Furthermore, while their youngest children attended school in the Dominican Republic, said school was supported by a U.S. non-profit institution. The students were taught in English by U.S. citizens.366\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 41; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 42; Second Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 24.\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimants argue that they also attended an American church in Jarabacoa, which was on the campus of the Caribbean Mountain Academy, a Christian reform high school, attended exclusively by U.S. students and where instruction was provided exclusively by U.S. teachers. The church services were conducted in English.367\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19; Witness Statements of Scott Taylor and of Jeffrey Schumacher.\n\n215.\n\nThe Claimants rely on the testimony of their American friends and colleagues in the Dominican Republic, to confirm their strong and continuing connection to the American community in and around Jarabacoa. In their testimonies, they confirm that the Claimants referred to Chicago as their \"*home*\" and that they almost exclusively socialized with Americans.368 In their communications with friends, the Claimants stated how they wanted to leave the Dominican Republic or how they felt like outsiders there.369\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 52.\n\nEmail from Michael Ballantine (January 29, 2012), **Exhibit C-163** ; Email from L.

However, they also voted on the 2008 U.S. Presidential election and the 2014 midterm U.S. elections, while residing in the Dominican Republic.370\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 26; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 63:6-8 (English).\n\n217.\n\nThe Claimants assert that despite Ms. Lisa Ballantine's and Ms. Tobi Ballantine's social media postings quoted by the Respondent, they considered themselves U.S. citizens. The postings have been taken out of context, especially Ms. Tobi Ballantine's, which are casual, flippant or sarcastic. In any case, the Claimants wonder how her youngest daughter social media postings are relevant to determining their dominant and effective nationality.371 Regarding Ms. Lisa Ballantine's Facebook postings, the Claimants complain that the Respondent only submitted the ones she refers to the Dominican Republic, while ignoring the many others in which she talks about the United States as her home or her connection to it. Although the Claimants do not consider these social media postings relevant, they refer to several between 2010 and 2014 that show her connection to the United States.372\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 50-53; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 72:23-73:16 (English).\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57; Second Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimants consider themselves foreign investors in the Dominican Republic and dominantly U.S. citizens. And equally important, the Respondent also considered them to be foreign investors and dominantly U.S. citizens.373 The Claimants explain that the dominant and effective nationality rule contained in the DR-CAFTA is a codification of the existing rule of customary international law on effective nationality for dual nationals in the context of diplomatic protection.374 The test of dominant and effective nationality was created to prevent \"treaty shopping\" and looking for diplomatic protection from a stronger state, while there is no genuine link of nationality between the individual and the state.375\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 45; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 78.\n\nKenneth J.

In 2010, shortly after becoming naturalized Dominican citizens, the Claimants commenced the proceedings to have Jamaca de Dios registered as a foreign investment under the Dominican Foreign Investment Law 16-95. Although they did not proceed with the application, the registration would have allowed to submit the Jamaca de Dios' profits to the United States.376 In May 2013, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, the Executive Director of the CEI-RD, considered the Claimants to be foreign investors and attempted to intervene on their behalf before the MMA.377 In July 2013, Mr. Michael Ballantine became an associate member of the American Chamber of Commerce in the Dominican Republic.378 On the same month, the Claimants met with U.S. Embassy officials to seek assistance in their appeal against the decision on the permit.379 The U.S. Embassy wrote to the MMA on behalf of the Claimants, as they were allegedly considered predominantly U.S. citizens. In May 2014, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez wrote to the American Chamber of Commerce, confirming the Dominican government's view that the Claimants were foreign investors.380\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 28.\n\nLetter from Jean Alain Rodr\u00edguez to Bautista Rojas G\u00f3mez (July 1, 2013), **Exhibit C-26**.\n\nLetter from William M.

It would make no sense for U.S. officials to advocate for Dominican investors before the Dominican government.381 The Claimants also refer to all the instances in which they were treated differently compared to Dominican-owned projects, to argue that even the Dominican officials viewed them as U.S. citizens and not Dominicans.382\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 64.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 68; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 78.\n\n221.\n\nIn September 2016, the Claimants allegedly began to take steps to renounce their Dominican citizenship.383 According to the Claimants, if they had known that their expansion permits would be denied, they would never have acquired dual citizenship.384 They claim not to have any familiar, cultural or economic ties with the Dominican Republic, apart from their investment.385\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 91.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 1.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 16.\n\n**C. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA'S NON-DISPUTING PARTY SUBMISSION**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe United States cites DR-CAFTA Articles 10.16 and 10.28 to explain who is considered a claimant and an investor and when a claim is deemed to be submitted to arbitration under the DR-CAFTA. Accordingly, if the investor is a natural person and holds at the time of submitting the claim as the dominant and effective nationality the one of the respondent State, then the investor would not be considered at that time a party to the dispute. Thus, the investor must be from another Contracting Party at the time of the alleged breach, in order for a breach under Chapter 10, Section A to arise.386\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n\n223.\n\nRelying on the doctrine of the continuous nationality, if the investor does not have a different nationality than the host State's at the relevant time, the respondent State will not be considered to have consented to the submission of a claim to arbitration and the tribunal will lack jurisdiction *ab initio* under Article 10.7.387\n\n*The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.

THE OBJECTIONS TO ADMISSIBILITY**\n---------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the admissibility of several claims because the documentation produced as a result of Procedural Order No. 5 shows that the Claimants knew in September 2010 about the creation of the National Park and the restrictions it would impose on Jamaca de Dios. Therefore, the Respondent considers the claims of violation of DR-CAFTA Articles 10.7, 10.5, 10.3 and 10.4 inadmissible, on the basis of the restrictions imposed by the National Park, since they would fall outside the three-year limitation period established by Article 10.18.1.388\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 109-110.\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent is omitting key information of the e-mail exchange in September 2010, specifically that ecotourism was allowed within the National Park. The Claimants considered their project to be ecotourism and they were told that it was allowed within the protected area of the National Park. Additionally, the Claimants argue that the creation of the National Park was never mentioned in the denial of permits, until the fourth one on January 2014. Thus, until January 2014 they never had knowledge of having suffered a loss.389\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 190-192.\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n---------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this is an admissibility claim because it affects the claim itself, instead of the ability of the tribunal to hear the case.390 Since the objection is not one of jurisdiction, it is not governed by Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.391\n\nObjection to Admissibility, \u00b6 9; *Ioan Micula, et al. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (September 24, 2008), \u00b6 63, **Exhibit RLA-88** ; *Abaclat, et al. v. Republic of Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (August 4, 2011), \u00b6 247(i), **Exhibit RLA-89** ; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A. v.

Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/17, Award (December 19, 2013), \u00b6\u00b6 627-628, **Exhibit CLA-26**.\n\nObjection to Admissibility, \u00b6 10.\n\n227.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent contends its objection is timely because\n\n(i) it was raised as soon as practicable after the evidence and facts underlying the objection came to light, and (ii) it is in any event an objection of admissibility rather than jurisdiction, and therefore not subject to Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.392\n\nObjection to Admissibility, \u00b6 12.\n\n228.\n\nHowever, if the Tribunal would consider it a jurisdictional objection, the Respondent argues that it should still be admitted because it was submitted as soon as practicable, after the Respondent became aware of the evidence and facts underlying the objection. The Respondent only acquired the e-mail exchange on August 2, 2017, after it had submitted its Statement of Defense. Therefore, the exception in Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules should apply. The Respondent relies on a leading commentary of the UNCITRAL Rules and arbitral jurisprudence to explain that late pleas due to the discovery of new evidence fall under the definition of \"justifiably late pleas\" under UNCITRAL Rules Article 23(2).393 Additionally, the Respondent argues that admission of the objection would not cause any prejudice to the Claimants, as they would have ample opportunity to respond.\n\nDavid D. Caron and Lee M. Caplan, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary* (Second Edition), Oxford University Press (2013), p. 456, **Exhibit RLA-91** ; *European American Investment Bank AG v. Slovak Republic*, PCA Case No. 2010-17, Second Award on Jurisdiction (June 4, 2014), \u00b6 115, **Exhibit RLA-92**.\n\n229.\n\nFinally, the Respondent reminds the Tribunal that it has an *ex officio* obligation to ascertain that the claims are admissible and within its jurisdiction. The Tribunal's power under UNCITRAL Rules Article 23(2) allows it to establish its own jurisdiction, deciding which issues can be addressed before it and which cannot, while giving the Parties a fair and sufficient opportunity to put forth their cases.394\n\nObjection to Admissibility, \u00b6 17; Jan Paulsson and Georgios Petrochilos, *UNCITRAL Arbitration*, Kluwer Law International (2017), UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Section III, Article 23, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4, 11, 19, **Exhibit RLA-95**.\n\n230.\n\nIn their witness statements, Mr. Michael Ballantine and Ms. Leslie Gil Pe\u00f1a stated that he first learned of the creation of the National Park on September 13, 2013, and about the restrictions imposed on Project 3 lands on January 15, 2014.395 However, two sets of produced documents show that in fact both knew about the National Park much earlier.396\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 66-67; Witness Statement of Leslie Gil Pe\u00f1a, \u00b6 39.\n\nEmail from Miriam Arcia to Michael Ballantine, Mario Mendez, and Zuleika Zalazar (September 22, 2010), pp. 1\u20132, **Exhibit R-170** ; Emails between Michael Ballantine, Mario Mendez and Miriam Arcia of Empaca Redes, and Zuleika Salazar (September 22\u201329, 2010), pp. 1\u20132, **Exhibit R-169**.\n\n231.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, these documents show that the Claimants as of September 29, 2010, at the latest, were aware of: (i) the creation of the Baiguate National Park; (ii) the fact that Project 3 was within the National Park; (iii) the restrictions imposed by the National Park on the lands within it; and (iv) the effects of the latter on Project 3.397\n\nObjection to Admissibility, \u00b6 24.\n\n232.\n\nOn September 22, 2010, Ms. Arcia informed Mr. Ballantine by e-mail that lots 67 and 90 of Jamaca de Dios were within the National Park, through the submission of a map.398 The map also shows that the area where the Claimants were hoping to develop Project 3 was within the National Park's boundaries. Ms. Arcia also explained that the use of lands was restricted to \"*scientific research, education, recreation, nature tourism, ecotourism*\", pursuant to the law on protected areas.399\n\nEmail from Miriam Arcia to Michael Ballantine, Mario Mendez, and Zuleika Zalazar (September 22, 2010), pp. 1\u20132, **Exhibit R-170**.\n\nEmail from Miriam Arcia to Michael Ballantine, Mario Mendez, and Zuleika Zalazar (September 22, 2010), p. 1, **Exhibit R-170**.\n\n233.\n\nOn the same day, Mr. Michael Ballantine acknowledged the existence of the Baiguate National Park and asked whether this was pursuant to the Environmental Law. The next day, Ms. Arcia replied that the boundaries had been created by the National Park Decree.400\n\nEmails between Michael Ballantine, Mario M\u00e9ndez and Miriam Arcia of Empaca Redes, and Zuleika Salazar (September 22-29, 2010), p. 2, **Exhibit R-169**.\n\n234.\n\nOn September 29, 2010, Mr. Mario Mendez confirmed that the land use was restricted. He stated that low impact ecotourism projects such as the Claimants', would be allowed, but the roads, and management of sewage and other waste would have to be discussed.401 Thus, Mr. Michael Ballantine had been warned that it was uncertain whether the construction of roads and the waste management facilities would be allowed within the National Park. Notwithstanding the previous e-mail exchange, the Claimants proceeded with the construction of a high-impact luxury complex.402\n\nEmails between Michael Ballantine, Mario M\u00e9ndez and Miriam Arcia of Empaca Redes, and Zuleika Salazar (September 22-29, 2010), p. 1, **Exhibit R-169**.\n\nObjection to Admissibility, \u00b6 32.\n\n235.\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 states that\n\n[n]o claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.403\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.18.1, **Exhibit R-10**.\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent holds that to decide whether the claims submitted to arbitration are within the time limit, the Tribunal must determine (a) the date on which the Claimants first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged breach; and, (b) the date on which the Claimants first acquired actual or constructive knowledge of the damages caused by such breach. According to the Respondent, if either one of the two dates is more than three years before the date on which the claims were submitted to arbitration, they will be time-barred.404\n\nObjection to Admissibility, \u00b6 35.\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimants' claims for expropriation, breach of fair and equitable treatment, breach of obligation of national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment were all based on the creation of the Baiguate National Park.405 Furthermore, they were all submitted on September 11, 2014, pursuant to the Notice of Arbitration of the same date. Thus, since the e-mail exchange shows that the Claimants already had knowledge on September 2010, the claims are time-barred and dismissed.406\n\nObjection to Admissibility, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n\nObjection to Admissibility, \u00b6 36; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 110.\n\n238.\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 envisages two types of knowledge of breach and loss or damage: (a) actual knowledge, which would be what the Claimants did in fact know at a given time; and, (b) constructive knowledge, which is what they should have known at a given time. The Claimants have to acquire either one of the two.407\n\nObjection to Admissibility, \u00b6 41; *Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3, Award (May 31, 2016), \u00b6 217, **Exhibit RLA-52**.\n\n239.\n\nTwo decision under the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\") have addressed the implications of the terms \"knowledge of the breach\". For the *UPS v. Canada* tribunal, the relevant question is \"*when* [claimant] *first had or should have had notice of the existence of conduct alleged to breach NAFTA obligations and of the losses flowing from it*.\"408 (emphasis added by the Respondent) The tribunal in *Grand River* held that its task was to decide if the record showed that the claimant had knowledge \"*of the measures complained of as breaches of relevant Articles of NAFTA*.\"409 (emphasis added by the Respondent) The Claimants conclude that the relevant question is actually if and at what point the claimant became aware of the measure itself, instead of, if and at what point it became aware that that the measure would constitute a treaty breach.410\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. v.

Thus, they knew of the measure that allegedly breached the DR-CAFTA.\n\n241.\n\nIn the DR-CAFTA case *Spence v. Costa Rica*, the tribunal held that the constructive knowledge test is an objective standard.411 Previous tribunals have confirmed that constructive knowledge \"*entails notice that is imputed to a person, either from knowing something that ought to have put the person to further enquiry, or from willfully abstaining from inquiry in order to avoid actual knowledge*\".412\n\n*Spence International Investments, et al. v.

Thus, they should have known of the relevant treaty rights and the alleged breach thereof, by September 29, 2010, at the latest.416\n\n*UPS v.

Nevertheless, it does not add anything new to the Respondent's knowledge because, pursuant to Article 10.18.1, the Claimants only have to show when they acquired or should have first acquired knowledge of the breach and of the loss or damage. The Claimants argue that along its Statement of Defense, the Respondent contends that the Claimants should have known by 2009 that the Baiguate National Park would be created. As a result, there is no such situation of grave injustice because the e-mail exchange does not show that Mr. Michael Ballantine knew of a breach or of a loss or damage.429\n\nAdmissibility Response, \u00b6\u00b6 97-99, 104, **Exhibit RLA-95**.\n\n253.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent cannot claim that the e-mail exchange provided information that it did not have before for the purposes of an objection under DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1. The Respondent had enough information to make such an objection earlier. Simply having new evidence is not sufficient to grant this late jurisdictional objection.430 Therefore, the Claimants argue that they are not responsible for the Respondent's late objection.431\n\nAdmissibility Response, \u00b6\u00b6 105-107. The Claimants reject the Respondent's reliance on *European American Investment Bank*, **Exhibit RLA-92**, because that case dealt with different facts, in which the investor's conduct was responsible for the admission of the objection.\n\nAdmissibility Response, \u00b6\u00b6 100-103.\n\n254.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent must show that the Claimants had knowledge of the breach and of the loss, and not either one of them.432 Thus, the relevant date is shifted further to the one in which the Claimants \u2013 both of them \u2013 had knowledge of the breach and the loss or damage.\n\nAdmissibility Response, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70; *Corona* \u00b6 194, **Exhibit RLA-52**.\n\n255.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the e-mail exchange in September 2010, between Mr. Michael Ballantine and the Empaca Redes consultants did not amount to the required knowledge of a breach \u2013 much less for Ms. Lisa Ballantine who was not even copied on the e-mails \u2013 because: (i) the e-mail explained that in the National Park ecotourism was allowed and the Claimants' Phase 2 was considered as such; (ii) other projects were freely developing in category II national parks, some even in the Baiguate National Park; (iii) the possibility that the National Park would be an impediment to develop Jamaca de Dios was not raised by the Respondent until September 2015; (iv) the three denials of the permit did not mention the National Park or the restrictions imposed by it; and (v) CONFOTUR approved Phase 2 after Mr. Michael Ballantine learned about the National Park.433\n\nAdmissibility Response, \u00b6 71.\n\n256.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants argue that the Respondent did not breach DR-CAFTA obligations because it had not used the National Park as a basis to deny the Claimants' permit, nor had it imposed restrictions on their development based on the National Park, until September 2013. Although the Claimants consider the manner in which the project was created discriminatory, since Dominican-owned projects were excluded, they recognize that the drawing of the National Park's boundaries is not a breach by itself.434\n\nAdmissibility Response, \u00b6 72.\n\n257.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimants contend that the e-mail exchange in September 2010 did not amount to knowledge of having suffered loss or damage at that point in time. The Respondent cannot argue that the Claimants suffered any loss in September 2010 because (i) the Claimants had been reassured by their environmental consultants that the National Park allowed ecotourism and the Phase 2 expansion was such; (ii) the Claimants could see other land owners developing in national parks; (iii) the National Park was not used to deny the permit or to impose restrictions on Jamaca de Dios until 2014.435 In fact, the Respondent does not deny that ecotourism is allowed within the National Park because its Management Plan made on 2017 allows for it.436\n\nAdmissibility Response, \u00b6 76.\n\nResolution No. 0010-2017*, Plan de Manejo del Parque Nacional Baiguate* (March 20, 2017), with *Plan de Manejo Parque Nacional Baiguate,* **Exhibit R-84**.\n\n258.\n\nThe Claimants argue that having knowledge of an offending measure is not the same as having knowledge of a breach, or of loss or damage, as was raised in the *Spence v. Costa Rica* case.437 The tribunal held that \"[w]*hile the Claimants' knowledge at the time of purchase may be material for purposes of any assessment of the value of the properties in question, it is not ultimately determinative either of issues of jurisdiction or of liability*\".438 (emphasis added by the Claimants) The *Spence* tribunal held, same as the *Corona* tribunal, that the relevant date is when the claimant first acquired knowledge of the breach and of the loss or damage as a result thereof.439 In this case, the Claimants argue that they would not have had a basis to know in September 2010 that they might be subject to expropriation and other significant restrictions. Even if they had known, it would still not raise the time bar.\n\n*Spence International Investments, LLC, et al. v.

Therefore, the Claimants did not abandon their claims, but they simply did not have them until the permit was denied on the basis of the National Park.443\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 88.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 89.\n\n**C. NON-DISPUTING PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**1. Costa Rica**\n-----------------\n\n261.\n\nCosta Rica, as non-disputing Party in these arbitration proceedings analyzes the statute of limitations under DR-CAFTA Article 10.18. The tribunal's jurisdiction is derived from the consent of the parties to arbitration. Article 10.18 sets out a series of conditions and limitations on consent. The statute of limitations as a provision reinforces legal certainty by requiring \"*diligent prosecution of known claims and insuring that claims will be resolved when evidence is reasonably available and fresh, therefore to protect the potential debtor from late actions*\".444\n\n*Vanessa Ventures Ltd v. Bolivian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/06, Decision on Jurisdiction (August 22, 2008), \u00b6 31.\n\n262.\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 sets out a relevant question for the tribunal: \"*What is the date on which the claimant first acquired knowledge of the breach that is being alleged?*\"445 (Emphasis in original) There are two alternatives to answer this question: (i) determining the date on which the claimant first acquired knowledge of the alleged breach; or, (ii) determining the date on which the claimant should have first acquired knowledge of the alleged breach. For the first alternative there is enough evidence to identify the specific moment in which the knowledge was first acquired. For the second alternative, the focus is on a set of circumstances surrounding the claimant that should have allowed it to acquire knowledge of the alleged breach. The facts must have been evident, made public and notorious, or there must have been a situation in which it was the claimant's duty and responsibility to know them.446\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 7.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; *Aaron C.

Thus, there is a *ratione temporis* jurisdictional limitation on the tribunal's authority to act on the merits of a dispute in this Article.448 And since the claimant bears the burden of proof, it has to demonstrate the necessary and relevant facts to prove that the claims fall within the three-year limitations period.449\n\n*Corona Materials LLC v.

THE RELATION UNDER DR-CAFTA BETWEEN THE RESPONDENT'S ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS AND ITS INVESTMENT PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nThe Respondent states that protection and conservation of the environment are important considerations under DR-CAFTA.453 Its Chapters 10 and 17 establish certain environmental obligations for the Contracting Parties. In particular, DR-CAFTA Article 10.11 provides that\n\n[n]othing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining, or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.454\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 87-90; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 1313:3-14 (English).\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.11, **Exhibit R-10**.\n\n267.\n\nAccording to this provision, the Contracting Parties preserve their right to apply their environmental policies without breaching their substantive obligations, notwithstanding the protections offered to investments under Chapter 10.455 Thus, the Respondent emphasizes that protection of the environment and promotion of open trade should be reconciled and be made mutually supportive.456\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 91; Beharry, Christina L., and Melinda E. Kuritzky, \"Going Green: Managing the Environment Through International Investment Arbitration,\" 30(3) American University International Law Review 383, p. 392 (2015), **Exhibit RLA-68**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 92; *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Separate Opinion by Dr. Bryan Schwartz, Partial Award (November 12, 2000), \u00b6 118, **Exhibit RLA-71**.\n\n268.\n\nThe Respondent compares NAFTA Article 1114 with CAFTA Article 10.11.457 NAFTA Article 1114 was interpreted to allow the adoption of regulatory measures to protect the environment without breaching investment obligations unless such measures were discriminatory.458 According to the Respondent, this would apply *mutatis mutandis* to DR-CAFTA, given the parity between the two provisions.459\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 93.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 94.\n\nStatement of Defence, \u00b6 95; *Aven v. Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/3, Submission of the United States, \u00b6 5, **Exhibit RLA-73** ; *Al Tamimi v. Sultanate of Oman*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/33, Award (November 3, 2015), \u00b6 389, **Exhibit RLA-76**.\n\n269.\n\nThe Respondent also refers460 to paragraph 4(b) of Annex 10-C to DR-CAFTA which provides that\n\n[e]xcept in rare circumstances, nondiscriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.461\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 96; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 1314:1-15 (English).\n\nDR-CAFTA, Annex 10-C, paragraph 4(b), **Exhibit R-10**.\n\n270.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent holds that a high threshold applies when claiming that an environmental measure was discriminatory, and thus in breach of DR-CAFTA Chapter 10.462 The Respondent summarizes the Claimants' allegations to the adoption of two measures: the Environmental Law and the National Park Decree.463 The first one is a general application law establishing the environmental protection framework for the Dominican Republic, while the second one is a general application norm which created 32 protected areas, including the Baiguate National Park.464 The Respondent defends the creation of the National Park as reasonable, to fulfill the Respondent's international commitments related to biodiversity and environmental protection and in reliance of Mr. Sixto Inchaustegui's Expert Report.465\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 97; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 1314:25-1315:4 (English).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 98.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 99-100; Environmental Law (August 18, 2000), **Exhibit R-3** ; Decree No. 571-09, **Exhibit R-77**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 101; Expert Report of Inchaustegui, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 48-55; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 149.\n\n271.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants have not met the high threshold established by DR-CAFTA, when it comes to prove that an environmental measure has resulted in a DR-CAFTA violation. Consequently, the enactment and enforcement of the Environmental Law and the National Park Decree cannot be considered DR-CAFTA violations.466\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 102.\n\n**2. The Claimants' Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimants explain that the exception in Article 10.11 will only apply if the measures are consistent with DR-CAFTA Chapter 10. Thus, if the measures are expropriatory or violate national treatment they will still result in a DR-CAFTA violation, despite being related to environmental concerns.467\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 245-246.\n\n273.\n\nIn this sense, the Claimants argue that the Respondent has not applied these two measures transparently and non-discriminatorily.468 The manner in which they were applied and the circumstances surrounding the creation of the National Park would be inconsistent with Chapter 10, and so the exception in DR-CAFTA Article 10.11 does not apply.469\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 247-249.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 250-252.\n\n**3. Costa Rica's Non-disputing Party Submission**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nAccording to Costa Rica, DR-CAFTA addresses the Contracting Parties' common interest of the protecting of the environment, as reflected in the treaty's Preamble.470 Through Article 10.11 the Contracting Parties ensure that the obligations in Chapter 10 are interpreted in conjunction with the intentions manifested in the Preamble.471 As a result, Costa Rica considers that Article 10.11 allows a Contracting Party to take measures necessary to address its environmental concerns and acknowledges the host State's general prerogative to regulate and enforce environmental measures.472\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 32.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 33.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\n275.\n\nIn this sense, Costa Rica highlights the importance given by DR-CAFTA to investments and the environment, which can be appreciated when Article 10.11 is read in the context of Chapter 10, the rest of DR-CAFTA, and its implementation.473\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 35.\n\n276.\n\nCosta Rica contends that to ensure the effectiveness of a treaty's objective and purpose, tribunals need to analyze the intention of the contracting parties by looking closely into the ordinary meaning of their words in their context. In the case of DR-CAFTA Article 10.11, the host States have the right to regulate, with a special focus on environment. As a result, this clause shows that the Contracting Parties' intention was to maintain a balance between both elements.474\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 36.\n\n277.\n\nIn sum, according to Costa Rica DR-CAFTA Article 10.11 reflects the Contacting Parties' determination to develop their policies on environmental protection without substantially breaching their DR-CAFTA obligations. That should be considered its point of effectiveness, in accordance with the principle of *effet utile*, which stems from the principle of good faith.475 As a result, when analyzing a claim, Costa Rica considers that there should be a balance between the investment protection and the maintenance of domestic environmental policies.476\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 37.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 38.\n\n**B. WHETHER THE RESPONDENT BREACHED ARTICLES 10.3 AND 10.4 OF THE DR-CAFTA**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent has breached its national treatment and most-favored-nation (\"**MFN**\") obligations under the DR-CAFTA, which apply to \"investors\" and \"investments\" equally. Thus, according to the Claimants, the Respondent has an obligation to treat the investors as favorably as it treats nationals and every foreigner and another obligation to treat investments \"*in the same no less favorable manner*\".477\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 168, 171.\n\n**(a) National Treatment**\n--------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimants explain478 that the purpose of the national treatment provision is to \"*ensure that a national measure does not upset the competitive relationship between domestic and foreign investors*\".479 Conversely, the MFN provision establishes the duty to treat U.S. investors and investments no less favorably than investors and investments from other foreign countries.480\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 172.\n\n*Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v.

Government of Canada* (NAFTA), UNCITRAL, Phase 2 Merits Award, (April 10, 2001), \u00b6 42, **Exhibit CLA-9**.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 185; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 427; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 107:7-16 (English).\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 489.\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

Mexico*,486 which lays out the basic requirements of these obligations, as follows:\n\n[I]t must be demonstrated first that the Claimant, as an investor, is in \"like circumstances\" with the investor of another Party or of a non-Party, or that the Claimant's investment is in \"like circumstances\" with the investment of an investor of another Party or of a non-Party. And second, it must be shown that the treatment received by Claimant was less favorable than the treatment received by the comparable investor or investment.487\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 174.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 174; *Cargill, Inc. v.

These comparators are Jarabacoa Mountain Garden, Mirador del Pino, Aloma Mountain, Paso Alto and Quintas del Bosque, among others.505\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 182.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 182.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 183.\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's proposed \"environmental impact\" comparable factor is not a proper and relevant factor to determine the \"like circumstances\",506 though it would be one of the factors to evaluate when considering whether comparators are in \"like circumstances\".507 The relevant factor \"*must take into account the regulatory purpose of the treatment in question and who or what is affected*\", and \"*the appropriate comparator for the like circumstances analysis cannot be divorced from the reasons for the treatment in question*\".508\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 441.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 116:7-18 (English).\n\nAndrew Newcombe & Luis Paradell, *Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Treatment*, (Kluwer 2009), p. 163, **Exhibit CLA-57**.\n\n290.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent's proposed factor is too narrow and too subjective.509 The Claimants explain that if the Claimants' and the Dominicans' projects are compared solely on their \"environmental impact\" it would be unnecessarily narrow, since a broad interpretation would be preferred to fully review the measure under the national treatment clause.510 Therefore, the Claimants propose the Tribunal to focus on comparing \"*the different projects operating in similar environmentally sensitive areas, such as developments or road projects in mountainous areas in the DR*\", which would be completely compatible with the Respondent's proposed factor.511 (Emphasis added by the Claimants)\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 442.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 443; R. Dolzer & C. Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law,* (Oxford U. Press 2008), p. 180.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 444.\n\n291.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimants argue that the Respondent's proposed comparator is too subjective because the analysis would result in dividing the projects between their positive and negative impact on the environment, a complicated exercise.512 It would allow the Respondent to simply choose \"*the comparators by asserting that other projects do not have the same environmental impact*\". Yet, the Respondent would not be a neutral observer and its negative assessment of the Claimants' project's environmental impact should \"*not be taken at face value*\".513\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 446.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 447.\n\n292.\n\nNevertheless, if the Tribunal were to use the \"environmental impact\" factor as a comparator, the Claimants state that their experts, Mr. Potes and Mr. Richter, provide enough evidence to assert that there are other projects more environmentally sensitive than Jamaca de Dios' Phase 2, such as Jarabacoa Mountain Garden, Mirador del Pino, Paso Alto and Quintas del Bosque I and II.514 In any case, the \"environmental impact\" factor would be misplaced. According to the Claimants, \"*the 'like circumstances' analysis must be based on an objective criterion which can easily be assessable by a neutral observer*\".515\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 448.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 449.\n\n293.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants claim that this comparator has never been applied by investment arbitration tribunals.516 The Claimants refer to the analysis in *S.D. Myers* on the \"like circumstances\" test,517 in which the tribunal held that the general principles of NAFTA must be taken into account,\n\nincluding its concern with the environment and the need to avoid trade distortions that are not justified by environmental concerns.

A *de jure* discriminatory measure will directly treat certain entities differently, while a *de facto* discriminatory measure are at the outset neutral but they still result in a differential treatment.527\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 184.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 185; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 489; *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

First, there must be a rational policy and second, an \"*appropriate correlation between the state's public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it*\".537\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 190; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 497; *AES Summit Generation Ltd. and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc KRT v.

By contrast, other projects with the same slopes exceeding 60% were allowed to develop, even without permits.540 Also, the Claimants contend that these circumstances show that the Respondent intended to discriminate against the Claimants, and yet even if the differential treatment was purely accidental or an administrative mistake, \"*this would not cure or ameliorate the violation*\".541 According to the Claimants, there would be no reasonable relationship between the Respondent's measures and the rational policy alleged by the Respondent.542\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 192.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 193.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 491.\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimants hold that the legal standard of \"like circumstances\" and less favorable treatment does not require that the investor prove that the less favorable treatment was caused by the investor's nationality, but only that the elements of the test are met.543 The Claimants state that tribunals have recognized that proving nationality-based discrimination can be an \"*insurmountable burden*\".544 For that reason, a claimant is not required to prove discriminatory intent.545\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 194; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 491.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 195; *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v*. *United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award (December 16, 2002), \u00b6 183, **Exhibit CLA-5** ; *International Thunderbird Gaming Corp. v.

The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n**(a) National Treatment**\n--------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it has not violated its obligation to provide national treatment to the Claimants, as set forth in Article 10.3 DR-CAFTA, based on four arguments: (i) the scope and meaning of Article 10.3; (ii) that the Dominican comparators suggested by the Claimants are not in \"like circumstances\" as Jamaca de Dios; (iii) that the Dominican Republic accorded the Claimants a treatment no less favorable compared to Dominicans; and (iv) that there are reasonable justifications to explain any differences in such treatment.546\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 145.\n\n307.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Article 10.3 intends to protect foreign investors and investments against discrimination by comparing them with domestic investors in \"like circumstances\".547 The Parties agree on the three-prong test used by investment arbitral tribunals to assess the host State's national treatment obligation.548\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 147.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 282. Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 148; *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v.

However, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants have failed to satisfy either requirement.549\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 149.\n\n309.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants have challenged nine measures550 under Article 10.3:\n\n(i) the denial of permission to develop their property on grounds that the area has slopes over 60%; (ii) the denial of permission to build a road and sell property that is within the boundaries of the Baiguate National Park; (iii) the requirement of environmental permits to construct a road and buildings; (iv) the inclusion of the Ballantines' property in the Baiguate National Park; (v) the rejection by the President of the Dominican Republic of the appeal against the permit denial; (vi) the non-issuance of a non-objection letter required from municipal authorities to proceed with a proposed mountain lodge project; (vii) the loss of control or dominion over the roads in the Ballantines' project; (viii) inspections and fines imposed on the Ballantines; and (ix) the imposition on the Ballantines of a requirement to submit environmental compliance reports every six months.551\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 186.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 150.\n\n310.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimants identified several Dominican comparators.552 The Respondent argues that these alleged comparators are not in \"like circumstances\" compared to Jamaca de Dios.553 The Respondent contends that the three factors identified by the Claimants for the \"like circumstances\" test554 have not been applied by the tribunals as part of a three-part test.555 In *Pope & Talbot*, *Corn Products* and *Grand River* cases, the tribunals applied one of the three factors, based on their appropriateness to the circumstances of each case, rather than applying all of them at once.556\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 183; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 456.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 152.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 177-181.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 153.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 154-156; *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

United States of America,* UNCITRAL, Award (January 12, 2011), \u00b6 167, **Exhibit CLA-12**.\n\n311.\n\nWhile the Respondent acknowledges the relevance of the factors set forth by the Claimants, they should not be considered the only factors to be taken into account. In particular, in the present case the Respondent argues that primary consideration should be given to the environmental impact of each of the projects.557\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 157.\n\n312.\n\nThe Respondent mentions that the Claimants' Project 3 posed risks to the surrounding water resources, possibly causing erosion and mudslides, negatively impacting the ecosystem's biodiversity, and affecting the Cordillera Central's endemic species.558 Thus, except for Aloma Mountain, the rest of the comparators are not comparable to Jamaca de Dios based on the environmental impact and risks that each posed.559\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 158; Expert Report of Inchaustegui, \u00b6 81(c).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 158.\n\n313.\n\nThe Responder holds that the location of each project indicates its environmental value.560 Jamaca de Dios' Project 3 is located at an altitude of between 900 and 1260 meters above sea level on Loma La Pe\u00f1a, part of a set of mountains known as \"El Mogote System\", with a unique environmental value and requiring special protection because of its altitude, water sources and biodiversity. The Respondent states that all the projects identified by the Claimants are outside the El Mogote System and at a much lower altitude, between 600 and 800 meters above sea level.561\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 160.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 161; Witness Statement of Eleuterio Mart\u00ednez, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, 52-56.\n\n314.\n\nThus, except for Aloma Mountain, the Respondent argues that the rest of the comparators cannot be considered to be in \"like circumstances\" regarding the projects' location.562 In addition, the Respondent states that it has not been proven that any of the comparators provide or intend to provide competing goods or services.563 Although the Claimants still argue that Aloma Mountain is appropriate as a comparator \u2013 because even though it was fined, it kept developing \u2013, the Respondent rejects the comparison for relying on largely anecdotal evidence564 which \"*proves very little on its own*\".565 The aerial footage would show that construction of a road took place between 2002 and 2006, and further development occurred between 2006 and 2011. However, from then on, there is no additional construction until 2017, since Aloma Mountain was fined in 2013 for building without a permit.566 Furthermore, Aloma Mountain's environmental permit request was rejected.567\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, Appendix A.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 162-163.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 225.\n\n*Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v.

In a category IV area, for example, more human activities are allowed than in a category II area such as Baiguate National Park.569\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 165.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 165.\n\n316.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent argues that the comparators and Jamaca de Dios were not subject to the same regulatory measures under the same jurisdictional authority.570 Many of the alleged comparators did not have an environmental permit, nor had they requested one.571 If the Claimants seek to compare the fine imposed on them and the lack of fines in the other projects, the Respondent points out that in that case, the claim would be time-barred under the DR-CAFTA three-year limit, since the fine was imposed on November 19, 2009.572 In any case, the claim would be unfounded because even if it was based on the amount of the fine, it still would not demonstrate discrimination, let alone nationality-based discrimination. Notably, the MMA has imposed fines on eight of the projects mentioned by the Claimants.573\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 221-222.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 222.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 223.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 223.\n\n317.\n\nThe Respondent complains about the Claimants' assertion that the Respondent is not a neutral observer in this case. The MMA's assessments of the projects are well-documented and pre-date the present arbitration proceedings. The Respondent disputes the contention that an agency created to protect the environment would go against its principles to win the present case. If the MMA did not really care about the environment, it would have been much easier to allow the Claimants' request for a permit. However, the Respondent's concerns for the environment are genuine and \u2013 based on Mr. Booth's and Mr. Deming's Expert Reports \u2013 Project 3 would have had a greater negative impact on Jamaca de Dios and on the National Park than Project 2.574\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 229-231; Expert Report of Peter Deming, \u00b6 48; Expert Report of Pieter Both, \u00b6\u00b6 99-100.\n\n318.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants have failed to establish that the comparators are in \"like circumstances\" with Jamaca de Dios, and thus, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss their national treatment claim.575\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 166.\n\n**(b) Less Favorable Treatment**\n--------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Dominican Republic accorded a less favorable treatment to the Claimants than it did to Dominican nationals. According to the second part of the \"three-part test\", the Respondent explains that the Claimants have to show that the investor or the covered investment was treated less favorably than a domestic comparator. To do so, the Claimants have the burden of proving a *de jure* or *de facto* discrimination.576 To demonstrate a *de facto* discrimination, the Claimants have the burden of proving that \"*the practical effect of the measures is to create a disproportionate benefit for nationals over non-nationals*\".577\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Kapa v.

Thus, the Respondent explains in a table the principal measures with respect to which the Claimants raise discrimination claims.580\n\nStatement of Defense, pp. 99-100.\n\n322.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent divides the different projects shown in the table into two groups. One group consists of projects at a lower altitude, such as Jamaca de Dios' Project 2, Jarabacoa Mountain Garden, Quintas del Bosque, Mirador del Pino and Paso Alto. While all these projects received a permit, some of them, such as Jarabacoa Mountain Garden, Mirador del Pino and Paso Alto, received a permit imposing slope-related restrictions.581 The second group compromises projects within the Baiguate National Park, such as Aloma Mountain and Jamaca de Dios' Project 3. Both are also located at a higher altitude than the others and in the El Mogote mountain system,582 and were thus accorded similar treatment.583\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 173.\n\nWitness Statement of Prof. Eleuterio Mart\u00ednez.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 174.\n\n323.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that with regards to the imposition of fines, Dominican-owned projects, similarly to Jamaca de Dios, received fines for violating environmental regulations. The MMA even suspended work on Dominican-owned projects and Jamaca de Dios for violating these regulations.584 Thus, the Respondent asserts that the treatment given to the Claimants and Jamaca de Dios was not less favorable than to Dominicans and their projects.585\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 175.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 176-177.\n\n324.\n\nLastly, the Respondent contends that it had valid justifications for whatever differential treatment the Claimants received. The differential treatment was justified because it was based on objective distinctions between Jamaca de Dios and the other comparators.586 The Respondent relies on *GAMI* to argue that a differential treatment has been justified when a host State has proven the existence of legitimate policy or legal reasons for the measures at issue.587 The Respondent recalls the nine forms of disparate treatment claimed by the Claimants, and states that each form of disparate treatment was grounded on such legitimate policy or legal concerns.588\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 178.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 179; *Gami Investments, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Award (November 15, 2004), \u00b6 114, **Exhibit CLA-49**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 180-181.\n\n325.\n\nFirst, regarding the denial of the environmental permit for Project 3 because of the slopes exceeding 60%, the Respondent explains that the permit was denied because in their request for terms of reference the Claimants did not clearly express that they would not build on slopes exceeding 60%. The Respondent recognizes that if project owners undertake not to build in areas with slopes exceeding 60%, it grants the permit. However, since the Claimants did not mention in their letter requesting reconsideration the possibility of changing the location or pledging not to develop in any area with slopes exceeding 60%, the Respondent denied the permit.589\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 182-183.\n\n326.\n\nSecond, regarding the differential treatment between the Claimants and the comparators on conducting activities in the Baiguate National Park, the Respondent explains that there is either no differential treatment, or the differential treatment is based on environmental considerations.590 There are different types of legal regimes concerning environmental protected areas that affect Jamaca de Dios and the comparators. While Jamaca de Dios is located within a category II National Park, which prohibits a wider range of project development activities; others are located in category IV National Parks, which are less restrictive on business activities.591 Regarding Aloma Mountain, the Respondent emphasizes that construction was not allowed. Aloma Mountain's first permit request was denied, and a reconsideration request confirmed the first denial. Furthermore, the Respondent points out that Aloma Mountain was fined due to unauthorized construction.592\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 184.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 185; Expert Report of Sixto Inchaustegui, \u00b6\u00b6 70-72.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 186; **Exhibits R-55**, **R-142**.\n\n327.\n\nThird, regarding the requirements to obtain an environmental permit not imposed on other developers, especially Aloma Mountain and Los Auquelles, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' allegations. Aloma Mountain's permit was denied twice, and a fine on the project was imposed.593 For Los Auquelles, the Respondent states that the project was never granted a permit, and was similarly fined for unauthorized construction.594\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 187.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 114, fn 422, \u00b6 223; Resolution Fine to Los Auquellos (July 31, 2017), **Exhibit C-137**.\n\n328.\n\nFourth, regarding the inclusion of Jamaca de Dios within the Baiguate National Park and the exclusion of other projects, the Respondent relies on its experts and witnesses to explain the legitimate environmental reasons behind the National Park's borders.595 If the discrimination had been the real reason, the Respondent contends that in that case the Aloma Mountain project would have been completely excluded by the National Park boundaries. Yet, since it shares environmental and height characteristics with Project 3's land, it was included.596\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 188; Witness Statement of Prof. Eleuterio Mart\u00ednez, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 44-45; Expert Report of Sixto Inchaustegui, \u00b6\u00b6 55, 60-62.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 189.\n\n329.\n\nFifth, regarding the discriminatory rejection of the Claimants' request for reconsideration, the Respondent argues that the claim does not give factual basis. The Claimants' argument that Jarabacoa Mountain Garden received the permit after meeting with officials of the Dominican Presidency, is considered hearsay by the Respondent.597 The Respondent asserts that Jarabacoa Mountain Garden is different to Jamaca de Dios because \u2013 while the initial proposal by the promoters was denied \u2013 the project accepted the slope restrictions imposed by the MMA.598\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 190; Witness Statement of Reynaldo de Rosario, \u00b6 9; Second Expert Report of Graviel Pe\u00f1a, \u00b6 15.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 191; Letter from Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez de Guti\u00e9rrez to Santiago Canela Dur\u00e1n, DEA-2869-12 (July 25, 2012), **Exhibit R-144**.\n\n330.\n\nSixth, regarding the discriminatory non-issuance of the non-objection letter by the Municipality of Jarabacoa, the Respondent considers this a rational reaction, considering that the Claimants only requested a \"no objection\" letter after the MMA had expressed its concerns on the viability of the project.599 In addition, the Respondent holds that the Municipality of Jarabacoa replied to the Claimants, explaining that it could not issue it since they were aware of the MMA's concerns.600 According to the Respondent, the Municipality acted in the most diligent way possible, in concert with other government bodies and avoiding causing false expectations on the foreign investors.601\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 192.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 193; Letter from Jarabacoa Municipality Council to Michael Ballantine (February 16, 2015), **Exhibit R-93**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 194-195.\n\n331.\n\nSeventh, regarding the alleged governmental pressure to turn the Claimants' private road into a public one, once a residential community is legally created, the roads are automatically yielded to the public domain.602 Furthermore, the Respondent argues that any circumstances related to the road were caused by the Claimants and thus, they are estopped from blaming the Dominican Republic or the Municipality of Jarabacoa.603 Since the Claimants were the ones who decided to open the road to the public, the Claimants cannot claim discrimination on the private or public nature of the road.604 In any case, the Respondent adds that it never forced the Claimants to turn their private road into a public one, however since they were blocking the long-standing public easement, the Palo Blanco community had no choice but to use their road.605\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 196; Article 6, Law No. 675, *Urbanizaci\u00f3n, Ornato P\u00fablico y Construcciones* (August 14, 1944), **Exhibit R-97**.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 198.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 196.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 197.\n\n332.\n\nEighth, regarding the inspections and fines imposed on the Claimants but not on other projects, the Respondent denies this assertion because inspections have been carried out, and fines have been imposed, on other projects as well. Thus, there would be no differential treatment.606\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 199; Mountain Garden's Payment of Fine for Violation of Law 64-00 (May 23, 2012) **Exhibit R-145** ; Resolution No. 445-2016-VGA (December 8, 2016) (imposing a fine in the amount of RD$2,742,980.00 on Ocoa Bay Town Village Phase 1 for building structures within a national park and outside the area approved for construction), **Exhibit R-73** ; Fine On Estaci\u00f3n de Servicios Reyna Dur\u00e1n (March 3, 2017) (imposing a fine in the amount of RD$ 245,640.00 on Estaci\u00f3n de Servicios Reyna Dur\u00e1n, a project owned by a Dominican), **Exhibit R-72**.\n\n333.\n\nNinth, regarding the requirements imposed on the Claimants to submit the EC Reports, the Respondent contends that the same obligation was imposed on other developers who requested an environmental permit. Furthermore, the MMA has imposed a fine on businesses which have not submitted the required EC Reports.607 The Claimants cannot consider this an added burden because the requirement was already imposed on their Project 2 permit. Lastly, the Respondent reminds the Tribunal that the fine related to the EC Reports submission was imposed after the Claimants had violated several other environmental regulations.608\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 200.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 201.\n\n334.\n\nIn relation to the Claimants' overall discrimination claim,609 the Respondent states that the MMA invited the Claimants twice to propose alternative sites for their project. According to the Respondent, it would not be reasonable for the MMA to offer its limited time and resources to a project that it has no intention to approve in the end, simply because of its owners.610\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 501.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 218; **Exhibits C-8**, **C-15**.\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent relies on DR-CAFTA Article 17.2.1 and the case *Al-Tamimi* to explain that the enforcement of environmental law is not inherently consistent because certain factors, such as the particular circumstances of each subject and project, affect its application.611\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 220; *Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v. Sultanate of Oman,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/33, Award, \u00b6 458, **Exhibit RLA-112**.\n\n336.\n\nLastly, the Respondent states that with regards to the Claimants' MFN claim,612 pursuant to the \"three-prong test\",613 the Claimants should have provided a comparator that was neither U.S., nor Dominican. However, the only comparators they have identified are Dominican.614 The Respondent affirms that the Claimants have not been able to demonstrate a specific treatment accorded to them or their investment which is less favorable than to the one accorded to another foreigner or their investments.615 As a result, the Claimants' MFN claim should be considered abandoned.616\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 168, 170, 173.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 205; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 174\u2013187; *Apotex Holdings Inc. v.

The United States of America's Non-disputing Party Submission**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nThe United States explains that DR-CAFTA Article 10.3 provision forbids nationality-based discrimination between domestic and foreign investors that are in \"like circumstances\". A claimant has the burden of proving that its investments: (i) were accorded \"treatment\"; (ii) were in \"like circumstances\" with domestic investors; and, (iii) received a \"less favorable\" treatment than that accorded to domestic investors or their investments.617\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; *United Parcel Service of America, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, ICSID Case No. UNCT/02/1, Award on the Merits (May 24, 2007), \u00b6 84, **Exhibit CLA-15**.\n\n338.\n\nThe term \"like circumstances\" will vary according to the facts of each case. The United States interprets the term \"circumstances\" as \"*to denote conditions or facts that accompany treatment as opposed to the treatment itself*\".618 Thus, consideration must be given to several factors, not just the business or economic sector but also the regulatory framework and policy objectives, among others. The foreign and the national investors should be compared in all relevant aspects but for nationality of ownership. Moreover, whether the treatment has been accorded in \"like circumstances\" under Article 10.3, will depend on all the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguished between investors or investments on the basis of legitimate public welfare objectives.619\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 14 (Emphasis omitted).\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 14.\n\n339.\n\nMoreover, Article 10.3 does not require to accord the investors or investments of another Party the best or most favorable treatment, given to any national investor or the investment of any national.620\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 15.\n\n**C. WHETHER THE RESPONDENT BREACHED THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT STANDARD**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent's actions constitute a violation of the \"fair and equitable\" treatment (\"**FET**\") obligation of Article 10.5 of the DR-CAFTA.621 Through a comparable analysis, the Claimants conclude that DR-CAFTA Article 10.5 is identical in substance to NAFTA Article 1105.622 The Claimants state that NAFTA tribunals have held that a State will be deemed to have violated the minimum standard of FET towards a foreign investor if it has violated the investor's legitimate expectations on which the investor relied when making the investment, if it failed to act in good faith or with evident discrimination, or if it engaged in arbitrary conduct.623\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 197-198.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 199.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 199.\n\n341.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's measures were discriminatory and arbitrary, and they lacked transparency and due process. These measures would include the creation of the National Park and its effect on the Claimants.624\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 15; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 289.\n\n342.\n\nThe Claimants hold that the investor need not demonstrate the existence of bad faith to prove the State's international responsibility.625 In this sense, the tribunal in *Mondev v. United States* stated that \"*a State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith*.\"626\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 200.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 202; *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, NAFTA, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award (October 11, 2002), \u00b6 116, **Exhibit CLA-23**.\n\n343.\n\nThe Claimants rely on *Mondev*, and *ADF v. United States* to contend that the minimum standard of treatment (the \"**MST**\") is a standard under customary law that can evolve.627 According to the *Mondev* tribunal, bilateral investment treaties include the standard of FET to try to incorporate customary international law, evidencing state practice and *opinio juris*.628 The Claimants quote the *Glamis Gold* tribunal,629 which stated that treaty arbitration decisions \"*serve as illustrations of customary international law if they involve an examination of customary international law, as opposed to a treaty-based, or autonomous, interpretation.*\"630\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 201; *Mondev* (NAFTA), \u00b6\u00b6 116-117, 124-125, **Exhibit CLA-23** ; *ADF Group Inc. v.

United States*, NAFTA, UNCITRAL, Award (June 8, 2009), \u00b6 605, **Exhibit CLA-25**.\n\n344.\n\nThe Claimants disagree with the Respondent's reliance on the *Neer* decision.631 First, because the decision issued in 1926 does not reflect the current state of the law on the protection of foreign investors, which in the Claimants' opinion has significantly evolved since the *Neer* decision.632 Second, because the *Neer* decision would stand in contrast to general state practice.633\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 201; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 258.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 259-260.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 261.\n\n345.\n\nThe Claimants request the Tribunal to reject the Respondent's argument634 that the standard of protection should be the one set out in the *Neer* decision.635 The Claimants argue that the *Neer* case did not deal with the question on the appropriate level of protection that should be granted to foreign investors, as the tribunals in *Mondev* and *Windstream* explained.636 According to the Claimants, several scholars have noted the limited relevance of the *Neer* decision, since it does not discuss the protection of investments*,* but rather a host State's obligation to arrest and punish perpetrators of crimes against aliens.637\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 215; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 232.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 201; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 258.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 259; *Mondev* (NAFTA), \u00b6 115, **Exhibit CLA-23** ; *Merrill* (NAFTA), \u00b6\u00b6 197, 204, **Exhibit CLA-16** ; *Windstream Energy LLC v Canada,* Award, (September 27, 2016), UNCITRAL, \u00b6 352, **Exhibit CLA-52**.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 260; J.

Int'l (2011), pp. 555\u2013561, **Exhibit CLA-55**.\n\n346.\n\nRegarding the second reason, the Claimants argue that even if the *Neer* decision was considered relevant to assess the content and scope of the MST for foreign investors, the standard of protection accorded to them has undeniably changed since 1926.638 For the Claimants, the decision's general statements stand \"*in contrast to state practice*\".639 The Claimants rely on several NAFTA awards to support this.640 Accordingly, the Claimants affirm that the MST has not remained fixed in time.641\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 266.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 261; *Railroad Development Corporation v.

Myers*, *Mondev*, *ADF* and *Loewen* cases suggest that the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety \u2014 as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process.749 (Emphasis added by the Respondent)\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 210; *Eli Lilly and Company v.

Thus, following the principle *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*, the Respondent concludes that these are the only types of discriminatory treatment covered by DR-CAFTA Chapter 10.756 The Respondent adds that arbitral tribunals have reached the same conclusion.757\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 218; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 234.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 234.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 219; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 234. *Methanex Corporation v.

The Claimants contend that Article 122 of the Environmental Law was applied discriminatorily because other projects which had slopes in excess of 60% were granted a permit.764 The Respondent emphasizes that the slopes were not the only reason for rejecting the Claimants' permit request. In this sense, the Claimants were notified that the Jamaca de Dios project in itself was environmentally not viable because the use of the land was restricted by Article 122 of the Environmental Law.765\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 312-314.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 238; Letter from Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez de Guti\u00e9rrez to Michael Ballantine (September 12, 2011), **Exhibit C-8** ; Letter from Zoila Gonz\u00e1lez de Guti\u00e9rrez to Michael Ballantine (March 8, 2012), **Exhibit C-11** ; Environmental Law, Article 122, **Exhibit R-3**.\n\n392.\n\nThe Respondent points out that Article 122 of the Environmental Law forbids any intensive labor that can increase soil erosion and sterilization on mountainous areas with slopes greater than 60%. The Respondent contends that it was impossible for the Claimants to cut a road without undertaking such an amount of work.766\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 239, 243.\n\n393.\n\nRegarding the comparison with other projects holding a permit although they have slopes exceeding 60%, the Respondent recognizes this fact but explains that those projects and their land were different from the Claimants, and thus, they are not suited as comparators, since none of those projects tried to develop within a national park or at the same altitude.767 The only project with an elevation comparable to Jamaca de Dios Project 3 is La Monta\u00f1a, and which is why La Monta\u00f1a's permit restricted any construction beyond 1300 meters above sea level.768 Similarly, the Respondent affirms that the Claimants cannot compare Jamaca de Dios with unauthorized projects with slopes greater than 60%, because penalizing an unauthorized activity is not the same as denying a permit.769\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 240, Appendix A.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 240; Environmental Permit La Montana (January 19, 2018), **Exhibit R-276**.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6\u00b6 241, 223.\n\n394.\n\nFor the Claimants, the fact that the permit was rejected in its entirety \u2013 rather than only with respect to the areas with slopes exceeding 60% \u2013 shows the Respondent's discriminatory intent.770 However, the Respondent states the Claimants agreed at the time that, before requesting a permit for the development itself, they should first request approval for the road.771 In practical terms, this meant that if the permit for the road was not granted, the rest of the expansion would be equally rejected.772\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 321; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 100.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 243; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 55; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 366. *See supra* \u00b6 116.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 243.\n\n395.\n\nOn the Baiguate National Park, the Respondent raises the same arguments as it did for the Claimants' national treatment claims. The projects used as comparators by the Claimants are not suitable, either because they did not receive a permit or because if they did, they were not a mountain project.773\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 245. *See supra* \u00b6 315.\n\n**(b) The Respondent's Measures Were Not Arbitrary**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that it has not acted arbitrarily towards the Claimants.774 While the MST protects foreign investors from arbitrary State conduct, some tribunals have noted that it has to be \"*manifestly arbitrary*\".775 (Emphasis added by the Respondent) The Respondent relies776 on certain NAFTA and DR-CAFTA awards to conclude that a State conduct is arbitrary when there is a \"*lack of reasons*\"777 or a \"*manifest lack of reasons*\".778 The Respondent quotes the *Glamis Gold* tribunal,779 which defined \"arbitrariness\" as a \"*gross denial of justice or manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable international standards*\".780\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 224, 228.\n\n*Glamis Gold v.

On the contrary, the investors would be obliged to take the law as found when entering a host State voluntarily.787\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 368.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 251.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 251; C.

As a result, individuals can initiate an appeal before the competent judicial authorities even if a particular request has not yet been explicitly rejected.797 The Claimants, who had Dominican lawyers,798 should have known this and could have acted accordingly.799\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 255.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 392-395.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 255.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 255; Law 1,494 of 1947 on Contentious-Administrative Jurisdiction, Art. 2, **Exhibit R-339**.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 13; Email from Michael Ballantine to B.

Non-disputing Parties' Submission**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Costa Rica**\n------------------\n\n408.\n\nCosta Rica argues that DR-CAFTA Article 10.5 sets out the conditions of the MST that each Contracting Party must accord to DR-CAFTA-covered investments.824 Costa Rica emphasizes the instructions in Article 10.5's first paragraph to accord investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including FET, and the second paragraph's directive not to give a treatment beyond the one required by the MST.825 Costa Rica further relies on DR-CAFTA Annex 10-B to contend that FET consist of the MST under customary international law.826 For Costa Rica, the obligation of FET is breached when there is a situation of extreme denial of justice or manifest injustice, resulting in a lack of due process.827\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 11.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 13.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 12; DR-CAFTA, Articles 10.5.1, 10.5.2, **Exhibit R-10** ; *Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award (June 26, 2003), \u00b6 132.\n\n409.\n\nCosta Rica argues that if a claim is brought due to a breach of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5, the claimant has the burden of proving that the standard was breached under customary international law, relying on general and consistent State practice and *opinio iuris*.828 According to Costa Rica, this shall be the main source of interpretation for the MST.829 This standard was also confirmed under NAFTA Article 1105 by the NAFTA Commission.830 Additionally, Costa Rica also relies on the test as set out in *Waste Management* and *Cargill* for the infringement of the MST.831\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 14.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 15.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 16.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18; *Waste Management, Inc. v.

Also, proof of good faith in the authority's efforts to comply with the objectives of its laws and regulations should be taken into account by tribunals when deciding whether international law was violated.832\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 19.\n\n411.\n\nCosta Rica notes that in *Mercer International*, the tribunal found that the MST provision does not cover discrimination, which is addressed in the national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment provisions.833\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 20; *Mercer International Inc. v.

Therefore, when alleging a breach of DR-CAFTA Article 10.5, Costa Rica puts forward that the claimant must prove that (i) there is a customary international law rule; (ii) the host State engaged in conduct that breached such rule; and (iii) the host State's conduct caused loss or damage.834\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 21.\n\n**(b) United States of America**\n--------------------------------\n\n413.\n\nThe United States agrees with Costa Rica that it was the Contracting Parties' intention to establish the MST as defined under customary international law, as the applicable standard under DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.835 The obligation to provide FET includes certain obligations, such as not denying justice; affording due process; not expropriating covered investments in violation of Article 10.7's conditions; and providing full protection and security.836\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 17.\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 18.\n\n414.\n\nThe United States notes that DR-CAFTA Annex 10-B establishes the methodology for interpreting customary international law rules covered by DR-CAFTA, namely, State practice and *opinio iuris*.837 The ICJ noted in a recent decision that national court decisions, domestic legislation dealing with a particular issue alleged to be the norm of customary international law or, official declarations by relevant State actors on the subject at issue can serve as evidence of State practice.838\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 19.\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 20; *Jurisdictional Immunities of the State*, 2012 I.C.J. at 122, 123.\n\n415.\n\nHowever, the United States does not consider the element of \"transparency\" part of FET under customary international law.839 It states that it is not aware of any general and consistent State practice and *opinio iuris* which establishes a transparency obligation on a host State under the MST.840 Moreover, a tribunal under Chapter 10 does not have jurisdiction to address matters that arise under Chapter 18. The jurisdiction of the tribunal is limited to claims based on a host State's breach of an obligation under Chapter 10, Section A, an investment authorization, or an investment agreement.841 Furthermore, Chapter 18 is subject to the State-State dispute resolution provisions in Chapter 20.842\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 21; *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v*. *United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF) */* 99 */* 1, Award (December 16, 2002), \u00b6 133, **Exhibit CLA-5** ; *Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v.

The United States recognizes that an investor may develop its own expectations about the legal framework governing its investment but those will not impose any obligations on the host State. Also, the United States is not aware of any general and consistent State practice and *opinio iuris* establishing an obligation under the MST not to frustrate the investor's expectations.843\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 23.\n\n417.\n\nThe United States adds that the MST standard in DR-CAFTA Article 10.5.1 does not include a prohibition on economic discrimination against foreigners or a general obligation of non-discrimination.844 A State can treat foreigners and nationals differently, even foreigners from different States.845 The customary international law MST incorporated in Article 10.5 prohibits discrimination, yet only in the context of other established customary international law rules. Moreover, investment claims on nationality-based discrimination are governed exclusively by the provisions of DR-CAFTA Chapter 10 that specifically address the subject, not by Article 10.5.1.846\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 24; *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v.

Likewise, decisions of international tribunals and arbitral tribunals interpreting FET as a concept of customary international law are not State practice for purposes of evidencing customary international law, although they can be relevant for determining State practice when they include an analysis of it.847\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 25; *Glamis Gold v.

Once the rule has been established, by virtue of State practice and *opinio iuris*, the claimant must demonstrate that the State has engaged in a conduct that has breached the rule. A showing of a breach of the MST \"*must be made in the light of the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their borders*.\"848\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6\u00b6 26-28; *S.D.

WHETHER THE RESPONDENT EXPROPRIATED THE CLAIMANTS' INVESTMENT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's actions amount to an illegal expropriation under DR-CAFTA.849 The Claimants contend that the Respondent has expropriated their investment through a series of measures that have prevented the Claimants from using their investment and deprived them of its value.850\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 227, 240; Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 508-509.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 237.\n\n421.\n\nUnder DR-CAFTA, an indirect expropriation takes place when a governmental action or a series of them have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation but without the formal transfer of title or outright seizure.851 Thus, the Claimants contend that they do not have to show that the Respondent formally seized their investments but rather that an indirect expropriation occurred, in accordance with the three-factor test set out in DR-CAFTA Annex 10-C.852\n\nDR-CAFTA, Annex 10-C, \u00b6 4, **Exhibit R-10.**\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 231; Reply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 504, 507.\n\n422.\n\nThe Claimants rely on DR-CAFTA Annex 10-C to state that for governmental action or actions to amount to expropriation,853 there must be an interference \"*with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment*\".854 Three factors must be considered:\n\n(i) the economic impact of the government action [\u2026] (ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and (iii) the character of the government action.855\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 232.\n\nDR-CAFTA Annex 10-C, \u00b6 2, **Exhibit R-10**.\n\nDR-CAFTA Annex 10-C, \u00b6 4(a), **Exhibit R-10.**\n\n423.\n\nTo define indirect expropriation, the Claimants resort to an authority on the matter,856 which stated that a\n\ntaking of property includes [\u2026] any such unreasonable interference with the use, enjoyment or disposal of property as to justify an inference that the owner thereof will not be able to use, enjoy, or dispose of the property within a reasonable period of time after the inception of such interference.857\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 233.\n\nLouis B.

Non-disputing Parties' Submission**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Costa Rica**\n------------------\n\n438.\n\nThe investments covered by DR-CAFTA are protected from direct and indirect expropriation. First, however, the asset in question must fall under the investment definition in Article 10.28. In particular, the investment must be considered so under domestic law to be considered likewise under international law.891 Indeed, it cannot be claimed that a State has expropriated a right, when such right \"*does not exist under domestic law*.\"892 Second, DR-CAFTA Article 10.8 must be interpreted in accordance with Annexes 10-B and 10-C.893\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 23; *EnCana Corporation v.

Costa Rica notes that Annex 10-C's paragraph 4(b) excludes measures of general application and State actions taken in relation to single investments to enforce public welfare, safety, health, environmental and other legitimate objectives, pursuant to the Contracting Parties' agreement. This express desire must be granted a high relevance when a tribunal has to decide on any indirect expropriation claim.894 Moreover, DR-CAFTA Article 10.7 reflects a customary international law standard as recognized by investment arbitral tribunals.895 The exercise of State police powers which are non-discriminatory and in good faith do not constitute indirect expropriation. Under customary international law, the doctrine of police powers comprehends a State's right to enforce existing regulations with respect to an investor.896 However, the State's actions must be analyzed to see whether they are a *bona fide* exercise of police powers.897\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\nSubmission of Costa Rica, \u00b6 28; *Fireman's Fund Insurance Company v.

If an expropriation does not comply with the requirements set out in Article 10.7, it will be in breach thereof. When an action is a *bona fide*, non-discriminatory regulation, it will not ordinarily be deemed expropriatory. Accordingly, paragraph 4 of Annex 10-C provides guidelines for an action to be considered an indirect expropriation. Although the analysis should be on a case-by-case basis, certain factors are included, such as: (i) the economic impact of the governmental action; (ii) the extent to which that action interferes with distinct, reasonable expectations; and (iii) the character of the governmental action.901\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.\n\n442.\n\nThe United States explains that the first factor, an adverse economic impact, does not establish an indirect expropriation by itself. International law requires that the claimant demonstrate that the governmental action at issue destroyed all, or virtually all, of the investment's economic value, or interfered with it to such an extent and so restrictively that one concludes that the property has been taken from the owner.902 The second factor requires an objective analysis of the reasonableness of the claimant's expectations, which may depend on the regulatory framework existing while the property was acquired, in the particular sector in which the investment was made.903 The third factor considers the nature and character of the governmental action, including whether it was of a physical or regulatory nature.904\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 33; *Pope & Talbot v.

Direct Damages**\n---------------------\n\n444.\n\nThe Claimants explain that the customary international law standard for the assessment of damages caused by an unlawful act is set out in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* Permanent Court of International Justice case,908 in which the tribunal noted that:\n\nreparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.909\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 277; Reply Memorial, \u00b6 517.\n\n*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Ger. v.

Although the method requires a certain degree of estimation, the Claimants allege that its primary inputs derive from Phase 1.919 Accordingly, the Claimants argue DCF is the best method to uphold the *Chorz\u00f3w* standard and wipe out the consequences derived from the Respondent's unlawful acts.920\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 545; *Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v.

TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS ON WHETHER THE CLAIMANTS ARE INVESTORS OF A CONTRACTING PARTY AS PROVIDED BY DR-CAFTA**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n503.\n\nThis dispute was brought by the Ballantines, in accordance with DR-CAFTA and the UNCITRAL Rules. As to the applicable law, the Tribunal recalls that Article 35(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules establishes that \"[t]*he arbitral tribunal shall apply the rules of law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute*.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n504.\n\nIn addition, DR-CAFTA Article 10.22 (\"Governing Law\") indicates the following:\n\nSubject to paragraph 3, when a claim is submitted under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(A) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(A), the tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law. (Emphasis added)\n\n505.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their claims under DR-CAFTA Articles 10.16.1(a) and 10.16.1(b) on their own behalf. The Claimants alleged in their Notice of Arbitration that the Respondent breached its obligations under Section A of DR-CAFTA Chapter 10.1022 Therefore, pursuant to Article 10.22, the Tribunal shall base its analysis both on the DR-CAFTA and the applicable rules of international law.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 8.\n\n**A. BURDEN OF PROOF**\n----------------------\n\n506.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that DR-CAFTA Chapter 10 does not contain any provision addressing the issue of the burden of proof in an investment dispute that may arise in accordance with its provisions.\n\n507.\n\nArticle 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, applicable to this case, establishes that \"[e]*ach party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support its claim or defence*\". This provision embodies the principle *onus probandi actori incumbit,* which is widely recognized and applied by international tribunals.1023\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Award, (July 26, 2007), \u00b6 121. The tribunal stated that \"[t]he burden of demonstrating the impact of the state action indisputably rests on the Claimant. The principle of *onus probandi actori incumbit* \u2013 that a claimant bears the burden of proving its claims \u2013 is widely recognized in practice before international tribunals.\"\n\n508.\n\nThe tribunal in *AAPL v. Sri Lanka* qualified this principle as an \"*established international law rule*\", and added that \"[a] *Party having the burden of proof must not only bring evidence in support of his allegations, but must also convince the Tribunal of their truth, lest they be disregarded for want, or insufficiency, or proof*\".1024\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products LTD (AAPL) v. Republic of Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/87/12, Final Award, (June 27, 1990), \u00b6 56. In this case, after stating that \"[t]here exists a general principle of law placing the burden of proof upon the claimant), the Tribunal explained that \"[t]he term actor in the principle *onus probandi actori incumbit* is not to be taken to mean the plaintiff from the procedural standpoint, but the real claimant in view of the issues involved [\u2026] Hence, with regard to 'proof of individual allegations advanced by the parties in the course of proceedings, the burden of proof rests upon the party alleging the fact*'*\" (Emphasis added).\n\n509.\n\nAt the jurisdictional level and in the context of the DR-CAFTA, the tribunal in *Pac Rim LLC v. El Salvador* considered that \"*the Claimant has to prove that the Tribunal has jurisdiction*\" and \"*if there are positive objections to jurisdiction, the burden lies on the Party presenting those objections, in other words, here the Respondent*\".1025 The tribunal in *Berkowitz v. Costa Rica* also expressly referred to Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and considered that \"*the accepted principle in international proceedings, at least at a level of generality, is that the burden rests in the first instance with the party advancing the proposition or adducing the evidence*.\"1026\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, (June 1, 2012), \u00b6 2.11, **Exhibit RLA-22**. The tribunal in *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. El Salvador* also referred to *Chevron Corporation (USA) and Texaco Petroleum Company (USA). v. The Republic of Ecuador* as follows: \"[a]s a general rule, the holder of a right raising a claim on the basis of that right in legal proceedings bears the burden of proof for all elements required for the claim. However, an exception to this rule occurs when a respondent raises a defense to the effect that the claim is precluded despite the normal conditions being met. In that case, the respondent must assume the burden of proof for the elements necessary for the exception to be allowed.\" *Chevron v. Ecuador*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 34877, Interim Award, (December 1, 2008), \u00b6 138.\n\nSpence International Investments, LLC, Berkowitz, et al. v. Republic of Costa Rica, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/2, Interim Award (Corrected), (May 30, 2017), \u00b6 29.\n\n510.\n\nThus, the Tribunal concurs with the general approach followed by other DR-CAFTA tribunals and agrees with the tribunal's opinion in *Pac Rim LLC v. El Salvador* that \"*it is not bound to accept the facts necessary to support or deny jurisdiction as alleged by the Claimant and the Respondent respectively; that the Claimant has the burden to prove facts necessary to establish jurisdiction (as it positively asserts); and that the Respondent has the burden to prove that its positive objections to jurisdiction are well-founded.*\"1027.\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, (June 1, 2012), \u00b6 2.15, **Exhibit RLA-22**.\n\n**B. GENERAL STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nAccording to the general rule of interpretation set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), which regulates the Tribunal's interpretative exercise, \"[a] *treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose*\".1028 Therefore, the Tribunal begins its analysis with the text of two relevant provisions for the present dispute: DR-CAFTA Articles 10.16 and 10.28.\n\nVCLT, United Nations Treaty Series, Vol. 1155, p. 331 (May 23, 1969), Article 31. Article 32 provides that recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation \"to confirm the meaning\" or to determine it when interpretation pursuant to Article 31 leaves the meaning \"ambiguous or obscure\" or leads to a result \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable\". On the interpretation of treaties, \"[a]ll three instruments are treaties under international law; and their interpretation is governed by rules of international law, expressed in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 \u2026 Under Article 31(1), the general rule requires a treaty to be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their \"context\" and in the light of the treaty's \"object\" and \"purpose\"\". *See* *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, (February 8, 2005), \u00b6 117.\n\n512.\n\nArticle 10.16 specifies who is entitled to submit a claim to arbitration, *i.e.* the \"claimant\", as well as the way in which it is entitled to do so (\"*on its own behalf\" or \"on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent* [...] *that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly\").* This provision makes clear that in order to bring an investment dispute under DR-CAFTA a claimant *must exist*.1029\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.1 complements this provision, stating that Chapter 10 applies to measures adopted or maintained *by a Party* relating to: (a) *investors of another* Party and (b) *covered investments*. The term \"covered investment\" is defined in Article 2.1 as \"an investment, as defined in Article 10.28 (Definitions), in its territory of an investor of another Party\". (Emphasis added).\n\n513.\n\nArticle 10.28 defines \"claimant\" as \"*an investor of a Party that is a party to an investment dispute with another Party*\" (Emphasis added). The concept \"investor of a Party\" is also defined by this provision as follows:\n\na national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party ; provided, however, that a natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality. (Emphasis added)\n\n514.\n\nThe definition comprises, in its relevant part, several requirements that must be fulfilled for a national or an enterprise to be an investor and in turn, a claimant: (i) a *national* or an *enterprise* of a DR-CAFTA Contracting Party must exist, (ii) such national or enterprise shall *\"attempt [] to make,* [be] *making, or* [have] *made an investment\",* and (iii) the investment must be located \"*in the territory of another\"* DR-CAFTA Contracting Party (Emphasis added). The concept of \"national\" is particularly fundamental for the application of an investment chapter and has a bearing on the issue of jurisdiction. In cases where an individual is a dual national, DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 establishes which rule must be followed to determine the relevant nationality and consequently, whether a covered investor exists for the purpose of dispute settlement:\n\na natural person who is a dual national shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality. (Emphasis added)\n\n515.\n\nThe Parties have argued extensively their respective positions. In the Tribunal's opinion, being the Claimants' dual nationals of the Dominican Republic and the United States, this dispute poses two fundamental questions that inform each other: (i) what are the *relevant times* in which an individual shall comply with the nationality requirement?, and (ii) what is the legal standard under DR-CAFTA to determine *dominant* and *effective nationality*. The answer to both questions forms the basis to determine if the Claimants, in the dispute before us, are covered investors under DR-CAFTA. First, we will develop both questions and then we will proceed to apply the legal standard to the facts of the case.\n\n**1. Relevant Times for the Compliance of the Nationality Requirement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n516.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, based on Article 10.28, the Tribunal \"*need only look at the nationality of the Ballantines as of the time that they made their investment in the Dominican Republic.*\" Moreover, they contend that they have \"*at all times been dominantly and effectively U.S. citizens* [\u2026] *from their birth until today*\".1030 The Respondent on the other hand, considers that \"*the Ballantines (who are dual nationals of the Dominican Republic and the United States) must demonstrate that, on 11 September 2014 (i.e., the date of their Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim), their dominant and effective nationality was their U.S. nationality*\".1031 Furthermore, \"*to establish that consent to arbitration exists, the Ballantines must prove that their U.S nationality was their dominant and effective nationality at the time of the alleged State conduct underlying their claims.*\"1032\n\nResponse to the Objection to Admissibility, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19, 21.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 36.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 106.\n\n517.\n\nThe Parties do not disagree on whether DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 and the phrase \"*that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of another Party*\" is of a disjunctive nature.1033 Instead, the disagreement revolves around whether the dual-nationality requirement is relevant at one particular time, or in other words, whether it should be assessed only in relation to one of those options in order to qualify as an investor.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 42.\n\n518.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, taking into consideration the rule of interpretation under the VCLT, Article 10.28 cannot be interpreted in isolation from other provisions that provide a context specific to DR-CAFTA as to whether there are relevant times in which a potential investor must comply with the nationality requirement (in the case of the present dispute, in accordance with the dual-nationality rule). As a starting point the Tribunal recalls the scope and coverage of DR-CAFTA Chapter 10, which is limited to measures related to investors of *another* Party, thus creating obligations strictly linked to that definition.1034 Consequently, the term \"investor\" and to which Party that investor belongs is determinant for the applicability of said chapter. If there is no measure relating to an investor of another Party then there is no obligation and thus there can be no treaty breach.\n\nBy definition, the dual-nationality rule pretends to exclude claims brought against a host State when the dominant and effective nationality of the investor is the one of the host State since in that case there would be no investment or attempt to invest in the territory of *another* Party. The term \"covered investment\" as defined in Article 2.1 also limits the applicability of this chapter.\n\n519.\n\nWe recall that the relevant provision indicates that investor of a Contracting Party *means* \"*a national*\" and thereafter includes the *type of actions* that may be conducted by such national. There is a distinction between both even though the two constitute elements that must be fulfilled to qualify as an investor. The phrase that follows thereafter clarifies what must be understood by *national* in the case of dual-nationality, however, the language used does not restrict the time in which the condition of nationality should be borne, *i.e.* it does not establish that investor means a national or an enterprise of a Party which bears such condition when attempting to make, making or having made an investment.\n\n520.\n\nThe terminology used in Section B of Chapter 10 provides a useful context to our interpretation that the text does not limit the nationality condition to the actions allowed in relation to an investment in order to come within the scope of Chapter 10. The section begins by referring in Article 10.15 to the terms \"claimant\" and \"respondent\". \"Claimant\" is defined as \"*an investor of a Party that is a party to an investment dispute with another Party*.\"1035 (Emphasis added) The incorporation of the specific term \"investor of a Party\" to the definition of \"claimant\" provides a *link* between what is an investor of a Contracting Party and what is consequently a claimant.\n\n\"Respondent\" is defined as \"the Party that is a party to an investment dispute\".\n\n521.\n\nThe fact that the necessary requirements for a natural person to be an investor of a Contracting Party (*i.e*. (i) *the existence of a national*, (ii) who has conducted a specific action (attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment), (iii) in the territory of another Party) are indeed incorporated in the definition of a claimant would logically suggest that they should be complied with *at the moment of an investment dispute*. The Tribunal observes as well that in order to be a claimant, an investment dispute must also exist.\n\n522.\n\nThe moment in which an investment dispute arises depends upon the facts and special circumstances of each case. However, DR-CAFTA Article 10.15 \"Consultation and Negotiation\" presumes the existence of such dispute before the submission of a claim as both parties \"*should initially seek to resolve the dispute*\" through those means. In any event, DR-CAFTA Article 10.16 makes clear that a claimant must exist at the moment of submission of a claim1036. In accordance with paragraph 4 and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, this means the moment the notice of arbitration along with the statement of claim is received by the respondent.\n\nDR-CAFTA, Art. 10.16 (*Submission of a Claim to Arbitration*), **Exhibit R-10** (\"1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation: (a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim [\u2026]; and (b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim[\u2026].\").\n\n523.\n\nDR-CAFTA Articles 10.17 and 10.18 on consent reinforce two related issues. First, consent to arbitration is provided when submission of a claim is made \"*in accordance*\" with the treaty. This means that the requirements examined above (such as the nationality condition) must be complied with for jurisdiction to exist upon the arbitration. Second, the three-year limit to submit a claim also provides context of the existence of another relevant time in which the nationality condition must be fulfilled, *i.e.* the date in which knowledge of the breach is or should have been acquired. This is so since, for a respondent to breach an obligation under Chapter 10, Section A, the measures adopted or maintained must relate once again to \"investors\" of another Party. In light of the definition for \"investor of a Party\", it is clear that the measures taken by the host State should not refer to one of its nationals.\n\n524.\n\nIn the context of DR-CAFTA's jurisprudence, the tribunal in *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. El Salvador* considered that \"*for the purpose of this Ratione Temporis issue, what CAFTA requires is not that the investor should bear the nationality of one of the Parties before its investment was made, but that such nationality should exist prior to the alleged breach of CAFTA by the other Party*\" and therefore concluded that it needed to determine *the moment when the parties' dispute arose* in order to establish if the claimant's nationality was present at the \"*relevant time*\".1037\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, (June 1, 2012), \u00b6 3.34, **Exhibit RLA-22**. The Tribunal notes that in *Bayview Irrigation District et al. v. United Mexican States*, a NAFTA case involving a similar provision defining the term \"investor of a Party\", the tribunal considered that some claimants met the nationality requirement since they were nationals of the United States and afterwards turned to the question of whether they sought to make, were making or had made an investment. *Bayview v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/1, Award, (June 19, 2007), \u00b6 89.\n\n525.\n\nThe text of DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 together with the aforementioned provisions indicate that the nationality condition as part of the investor qualification is not only relevant at the moment the investment was made and therefore, such assessment should not be made only in reference to that time. Although we are also aware that other investment tribunals have addressed the principle of continuous national identity, in order to solve this matter, this Tribunal is only called upon to determine whether the Claimants qualified as investors as of the date in which the claim was submitted to arbitration as well as of the date of the alleged breach, as relevant times. The existence of an investor, *necessarily includes* the *nationality condition* in order for the State to have been subject to an obligation as well as for a claimant to exist.\n\n526.\n\nThe Tribunal finds instructive for its interpretation, the written submissions of other DR-CAFTA Parties pursuant to Article 10.20.2. The United States indicated that in order to submit a claim, an investor must be an investor of a Contracting Party other than the respondent Party. The United States further stated that \"if the investor is a natural person, and that person had the dominant and effective nationality of the respondent Party at the time of submission of the claim, then the investor would not be, *at that time,* a party to a dispute with *another Party.*\"1038 On the other hand, Costa Rica refers in its submission to the conditions and limitations on consent and points that according to Article 10.18, \"*the Tribunal, when confronted with a set of facts, will have to answer one main question: What is the date on which the claimant first acquired knowledge of the breach that is being alleged?*\"1039 (Emphasis in original)\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 3. The United States also indicates that \"the claimant also must be \"an investor of a Party\" other than the respondent Party at the time of the purported breach [\u2026] Where the requisite nationality does not exist at the operative times set out above, the respondent Party has not consented to the submission of a claim to arbitration at the outset, and the tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction *ab initio* under Article 10.17\". It also refers to Article 10.18.1 and its view that \"a claimant must prove the necessary and relevant facts to establish that each of its claims falls within the three-year limitations period\". *See* Submission of the United States, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 8; and Article 10.1 of DR-CAFTA.\n\nSubmission of the Republic of Costa Rica, \u00b6\u00b6 3-10.\n\n527.\n\nIn view of this, the Tribunal does not consider that the examination of dominant and effective nationality should be circumscribed to the moment the investment was made. The analysis of DR-CAFTA provisions referred to above indicates that compliance with this requirement is fundamental at the moment the claim was submitted, in this case, September 11, 2014 and at the moment of the alleged breach, which, according to the facts of the case and in light of Article 10.18, allegedly took place starting from 2011, when the Claimants were naturalized as Dominicans. For the Tribunal, the above critical dates provides temporal context in which the terms of Article 10.28 shall be interpreted in accordance with the VCLT.\n\n528.\n\nHaving determined the relevant times to assess the nationality of the Claimants, we proceed now to analyze the dual-nationality legal standard provided by DR-CAFTA.\n\n**2. Dominant and Effective Nationality Standard under DR-CAFTA**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n529.\n\nAs analyzed in the preceding section, DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 expressly provides a rule on dual-nationality according to which a natural person \"*shall be deemed to be exclusively a national of the State of his or her dominant and effective nationality*\". Although there is no express reference made to customary international law in this provision, the inclusion of the phrase \"*dominant and effective nationality*\" clearly suggests the application of a concept that has been used in the context of customary international law.1040 However, before addressing the specific issue before us, the Tribunal considers important to make certain preliminary observations regarding the circumstances of this case.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties made reference to the pertinence of international law and the standard developed in such context for the interpretation of \"dominant and effective\" nationality. Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 12; Response to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 22.\n\n**(a) Preliminary Considerations**\n----------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that this is a case of first impression related to dual-nationality provisions in the context of DR-CAFTA. *First*, the relevant provision seems to presuppose that in cases of dual-nationality there will be one that will be dominant and effective over the other, *i.e.,* ultimately there will be one answer. *Second*, the language used allows dual-nationality and claims by dual nationals so long as their dominant and effective nationality is not that of the host State. This is confirmed by the inclusion of the phrases: \"*another Party*\" as well as \"*deemed to be exclusively*\" in conjunction with the adjectives \"*dominant and effective*\". *Third*, the treaty does not prescribe the factors that may be considered to determine dominance and effectiveness. *Fourth*, the Tribunal should take guidance from customary international law, taking into account Article 10.28 particular context, within DR-CAFTA's general object and purpose. This follows from Article 10.22 providing that: \"*the Tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law*\". (Emphasis added) In turn, this necessarily entails first, giving effect to the specific context provided for in this instrument as well as its object and purpose; second, giving effect to the customary rules of international law \"*as an applicable rule of international law*\".\n\n531.\n\nOn this matter, the Tribunal deems appropriate to make certain observations. Unlike substantive provisions such as, Articles 10.5 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), 10.6 (Treatment in Case of Strife) or 10.7.1 (Expropriation)1041, which contain an express reference to customary international law, the definition in Article 10.28 does not contain such a reference. Nevertheless, the Tribunal has no doubt that the expression \"dominant and effective\" is rooted on customary international law.\n\n*See* DR-CAFTA, Annexes 10-B and 10-C.\n\n532.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties have extensively argued on the application of the dominant and effective standard under customary international law. On one hand, the Claimants indicated that: \"CAFTA-DR does not provide a defined test\", \"*reference to international law is appropriate to aid the Tribunal's evaluation of this issue*\" and that \"*decisions of the US-Iran Claims Tribunal provide guidance in describing factors that may be considered in evaluating which of two nationalities should be deemed 'dominant'*.\"1042 (Emphasis added) The Claimants also stated that: \"*the decisions from the US-Claims Tribunal* [\u2026] *relate to an entirely different set of circumstances and arise under an entirely different treaty* [\u2026] [a]*lthough the* [Iran-]*U.S. Claims Tribunal cases are* [sic] *instructive and can be a guide in some parts, these cases do not obviously control or provide a precedent in this case. Thus, given the absence of examination of this issue under CAFTA-DR by other tribunals, this is essentially a case of first impression*\".1043 (Emphasis added) On the other hand, the Respondent has argued that \"*the Tribunal must assess 'applicable rules of international law ' since DR-CAFTA does not articulate any standard for determining the dominant and effective nationality*\"1044 (Emphasis added). Neither of the other DR-CAFTA Parties provided its views to the Tribunal on this issue.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 22.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\nRequest for Bifurcation, \u00b6 12.\n\n533.\n\nMoreover, the inclusion of this phrase on an investment chapter within the broader framework of a Free Trade Agreement imbues that phrase with a specific meaning. Analyzing the terms of Article 10.28 without consideration of the context that surrounds it would imply disregarding the general rule of interpretation that we must apply under the VCLT. The Tribunal considers that the factors developed under customary international law cases are instructive, although such factors reflect an interpretation developed in a specific period of time and under different circumstances from the ones present in this case, *i.e.* a dual nationality case related to investment protection provided for in a specific treaty, *i.e.* DR-CAFTA. In view of this, and while we do take due consideration of the factors analyzed in prior cases, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to give specific meaning to the terms used in DR-CAFTA rather than directly incorporating any other standard, which would disregard the rules of interpretation that we are bound to apply under the VCLT.\n\n534.\n\nFinally, this case presents a unique fact pattern. Usually, when dealing with nationality issues, investment tribunals are confronted with the question of whether an investor acquired nationality in order to gain access and protection through a treaty. However, this case deals with the question of whether the Claimants \uf02d who acquired in addition to their U.S. nationality, the citizenship of the host State before submitting their claim \uf02d \"lost\" their right to access this mechanism because they were dominant and effective nationals of the respondent State at the time of the alleged breach and the submission of their claim.\n\n**(b) The Meaning of Dominant and Effective under DR-CAFTA**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n535.\n\nAccording to the rule of treaty interpretation established in the VCLT, we begin our analysis with the text of DR-CAFTA Article 10.28. This provision qualifies the word \"nationality\" by virtue of the adjectives \"dominant\" and \"effective\". The use of the connector \"and\" would indicate that a nationality has to be both dominant and effective for a natural person to qualify as an investor of a Contracting Party. The meaning of the word \"dominant\" means \"*commanding, controlling, or prevailing over all others; very important, powerful, or successful; overlooking and commanding from a superior position; of, relating to, or exerting ecological or genetic dominance; being the one of a pair of bodily structures that is the more effective or predominant in action.*\"1045 The meaning of the word \"effective\" means \"*producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect; impressive, striking; being in effect: operative; actual; ready for service or action.\"*1046 In addition, \"nationality\" is defined as \"*national character*\"; \"*national status specifically: a legal relationship involving allegiance on the part of an individual and usually protection on the part of the state; membership in a particular nation*\".1047\n\n\"dominant\". *Merriam-Webster.com*. 2019. https://www.merriam-webster.com.

Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 154.\n\n\"closely aligned\".

In the Rejoinder they make references such as \"the dominant nationality \"test\" established in DR-CAFTA\"; \"*What is not in dispute* is that the Ballantines at no time severed their dominant cultural attachment to the United States\", \"A full spectrum review of relevant factors reveals the Ballantines' continuing and dominant US nationality\"; \"The Ballantines have never considered themselves dominantly Dominican\"; \"Tribunals have made clear that it is important to look at a claimant's *entire life* in evaluating its truly dominant nationality\"; \"\u2026whether or not this Tribunal should deem the Ballantines to be predominantly U.S. nationals or predominantly Dominican\"; \"The Ballantines have at all times been dominantly U.S. citizens\", \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, 10, 18.\" In their Rejoinder, section C is titled \"Appropriate Time Frame for Evaluation of the Ballantines' Dominant Nationality\"; section D is titled \"This Tribunal Can Consider a Broad Spectrum of Social, Cultural, Family and Economic Factors in Determining Dominant Nationality\". The Tribunal bears in mind that during the hearing, Mr. Baldwin indicated that in his view \"dominant and effective are two different things [a]nd here both have to be satisfied\". Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 97 (English).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 27.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 28.\n\n537.\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.28 presupposes the existence of a bond between a natural person and two countries by virtue of the nationality each one has bestowed upon such individual, *i.e.* the existence of that connection is not doubted, it exists. However, for a claimant to be considered as such, that connection to the non-host State must be of a certain type: it must be dominant and effective.\n\n538.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the word \"dominant\" conveys the notion of strength and precedence of one thing over another and that closeness between an individual and a State can indicate such attributes. In turn, closeness with a State and the strength of a nationality bond, could be the result of several factors in play such as the time spent by the individual in that country, family and personal attachments, language, education, work, economic or financial attachments, *i.e.* a cluster of elements that make up the life of an individual and that define several connections to a particular State. We understand \"dominance\" as referring to the degree or magnitude in which such connections are stronger than the connections that could have also been built by the individual in relation to another State that has also bestowed its nationality.\n\n539.\n\nThe word \"effective\" on the other hand seems to refer to something that produces a specific effect, something that is actually operative or functioning. We understand this concept as requiring this nationality bond to go beyond a formality with no apparent further effect, to be of substance rather than merely declaratory. An individual can possess a second nationality but this would not necessarily mean that such nationality is effective if, for instance, it has never been exercised; if the individual has never presented himself or herself as a national of that country; if he or she never visited that country; if he or she holds no personal or professional connection to that country; or if he or she has never complied with obligations or exercised rights as national of that country. There must be significance in the fact that Article 10.28 does not simply require nationality to exist, it requires that nationality complies with two specific qualities that should be different from the existence of that legal bond.\n\n540.\n\nThis does not necessarily imply that the legal standard to assess dominance and effectiveness should be different or that criteria used to determine if nationality is dominant would be useless to determine effectiveness. According to the text, the standard is one: \"dominant and effective nationality\" and in order to comply with it those two elements must be met. For example, an individual may hold two nationalities with only one being dominant and effective in view of the fact that the second one has never been exercised or been operational. There could be other cases in which both nationalities are effective if the individual exercises both of them, presents himself or herself as national of both countries, complies with both sets of obligations. However only one of them has to be strong enough so as to take precedence over the legal bond of that same individual with the other country. It does not seem to be a matter of extinguishing one bond in favor of another. This is what makes the assessment of determining which nationality is \"dominant and effective\" more challenging.\n\n541.\n\nGiven the fact that Article 10.28 does not provide more guidance for interpreting the meaning of \"dominant and effective\" nor on the criteria for such an analysis, the Tribunal, in conformity with Article 10.22 of DR-CAFTA and Article 31.3(c) of the VCLT, will also explore customary international law as \"*other relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Parties*\".\n\n**(c) Dominance and Effectiveness in the Context of Customary International Law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n542.\n\nIn the area of investment disputes, customary international law on dual-nationality has been touched upon but the Tribunal considers that such precedents are distinguishable to the case before us, either because (i) the relevant provision was different than the one contained in DR-CAFTA1053 or (ii) the factual scenario was different,1054 or (iii) both.1055\n\n*Champion Trading Company, Ameritrade International, Inc. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9, Decision on Jurisdiction, (October 21, 2003), Section 3.4.1, pp.9 -17. The tribunal was faced with the absolute bar on claims from dual-nationals contained in Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. However, this case is not based on a bar on claims from dual-nationals but on dual-nationality itself.\n\n*Eudoro Armando Olgu\u00edn v. Republic of Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/5, Award, (July 26, 2001), \u00b6\u00b6 60-61. This case presents different features since Mr. Olgu\u00edn's nationalities were of a country not Party to the BIT and a Party that was not the Respondent State: The claimant possessed dual-nationality, however, access to arbitral jurisdiction rested on nationality and not on its dominance and effectiveness. Moreover, none of Mr. Olgu\u00edn's nationalities were that of the host or respondent State.\n\n*Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas and Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2013-3, Decision on Jurisdiction, (December 15, 2014), \u00b6\u00b6 173-175. (Available in Spanish). In the absence of an explicit rule in the BIT on dual nationality, the tribunal rejected the application of customary international rules on diplomatic protection to BIT's in general and to the specific BIT at issue, and thus rejected the application of the dominant and effective nationality test. This award was partially annulled by the Paris Court for lack of jurisdiction *ratione materiae*. However, the Paris Court held that the tribunal had jurisdiction *ratione personae* since the BIT and the applicable UNICTRAL rules did not prevent Spanish-Venezuelan bi-nationals from bringing an action against one of their States of origin (*Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas and Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber v. Venezuela*, Decision of the Paris Court of Appeal on the Set Aside Application, (April 25, 2017), p. 9.) (Available in French).  \n*See* https://www.transnational-dispute-management.com/downloads/19597\\_case\\_report\\_venezuela\\_v\\_armas-gruber\\_2017.pdf and IA Reporter, *Paris court partly annuls jurisdictional award in dual-national claim against Venezuela*, April 26, 2017, https://www.iareporter.com/articles/paris-court-partly-annuls-jurisdictional-award-in-dual-national-claim-against-venezuela/. The Paris Court decision was subsequently vacated by the Court of Cassation, and the case was remanded for further reconsideration.\n\n543.\n\nRecently, the tribunal in *David R. Aven v. Costa Rica* considered the text of Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA in the context of its determination of whether the nationality of a dual citizen (of one of the signatories to the DR-CAFTA) was \"effective\", as well as his purpose for initially representing himself as Italian.1056 However, that tribunal expressly stated that the fact pattern in that case \"[did] *not trigger Article 10.28's mechanism for dealing with dual nationals*\"1057, due to the fact that the dispute did not involve, as in our case, a claimant who possessed nationalities of two Contracting Parties to DR-CAFTA.\n\nThis case concerned a dual citizen of the United States (a Contracting Party to DR-CAFTA) and of Italy\n\n*David R. Aven and Others v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/3, Award, (September 18, 2018), \u00b6 215. The tribunal in *Aven* did not dissect and apply Article 10.28. However, it did apply directly the *Nottebohm* test as it considered it incorporated by reference. For the reasons already expressed, this Tribunal disagrees to the extent this suggests that the same test directly applies to Article 10.28.\n\n544.\n\nAlthough, as mentioned above, dual-nationality has been addressed in the context of investment arbitration, the Tribunal does not find support as to the meaning of \"dominant and effective\" nationality that would allow us to use such precedents as guidance for the dispute before us.\n\n545.\n\nRegarding customary international law and, specifically, in the context of diplomatic protection, dual-nationality was addressed by the ICJ in the *Nottebohm Case*, even though the case itself did not deal with dual-nationality. That case does not use the terminology \"dominant and effective\" nationality as Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA but *\"real and effective*\". The main question to be decided in *Nottebohm* was whether the nationality granted to an individual by one State was binding or enforceable *vis a vis* a third State, in the context of diplomatic protection.1058*Nottebohm* does not deal with the concept of \"dominant nationality\". Nevertheless, the ICJ reference to certain principles as applied by arbitrators \"*for determining whether full international effect was to be attributed to the nationality invoked*\"1059, which were lately recognized by international tribunals as relevant criteria to decide dual nationality issues.\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment, (April 6, 1955), p. 24, **Exhibit RLA-6**.\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment, (April 6, 1955), p. 22, **Exhibit RLA-6**.\n\n546.\n\nIn addition, the Italian \u2013 United States Conciliation Commission, in the *Merg\u00e9* case, referred to \"the principle of effective\" as \"dominant nationality\" and seemed to equate both concepts while stating \"*effective nationality does not mean only the existence of a real bond, but means also the prevalence of that nationality over the other, by virtue of facts which exist in the case*\".1060 On its part, the Iran \u2013 United States Claims Tribunal, in dealing with dominant and effective nationality expressed that: \"*the relevant rule of international law which the Tribunal may take into account* . [\u2026] *is the rule that flows from the dictum of Nottebohm, the rule of real and effective nationality, and the search for 'stronger factual ties between the person concerned and one of the States whose nationality was involved'*\".1061\n\n*Merg\u00e9 Case,* Italian-United States Conciliation Commission, Decision No. 55, (June 10, 1955), pp. 246-247, **Exhibit RLA-7**.\n\n*Case No. A/18*, IUSCT Case No. A/18, Decision No. DEC 32-A18-FT, (April 6, 1984), p. 12, **Exhibit RLA-8.**\n\n547.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that customary international law has developed and crystalized relevant factors to determine, in cases dealing with dual nationality, which is the dominant and effective one. Next, the Tribunal will deal with those factors.\n\n**(d) Factors to be Considered in Assessing \"Dominant and Effective\" Nationality**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n548.\n\nAs to the criteria developed by other tribunals to assess dual nationality cases1062, the ICJ recognized that:\n\n\"[d]ifferent factors are taken into consideration, and their importance will vary from one case to the next: the habitual residence of the individual concerned is an important factor, but there are other factors such as the centre of his interests, his family ties, his participation in public life, attachment shown by him for a given country and inculcated in his children, etc.\"1063 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Nottebohm* does not concern dual nationality, but the Court recognized that \"International arbitrators have decided in the same way numerous cases of dual nationality\", *Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment (April 6, 1955), p. 22, **Exhibit RLA-6**.\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment, (April 6, 1955), p. 22, **Exhibit RLA-6**. The Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal also made reference to these factors as relevant although it stated that it would consider \"all relevant factors\". *Case No. A/18*, IUSCT Case No. A/18, Decision No. DEC 32-A18-FT, (April 6, 1984), p. 12, **Exhibit RLA-8**.\n\n549.\n\nThe Court also recognized that these elements do not constitute an exhaustive list of factors. In the same vein, in the *Merg\u00e9* case, the Italian - United States Conciliation Commission stated: \"[i] *n order to establish the prevalence of the United States nationality in individual cases, habitual residence can be one of the criteria of evaluation, but not the only one. The conduct of the individual in his economic, social, political, civic and family life, as well as closer and more effective bond with one of the two states must be considered*\".1064\n\n*Merg\u00e9 Case,* Italian-United States Conciliation Commission, Decision No. 55, (June 10, 1955), p. 247, **Exhibit RLA-7**.\n\n550.\n\nFollowing the above precedents, the Iran \u2013 United States Claims Commission decided that \"*in determining the dominant and effective nationality, the Tribunal will consider all relevant factors, including habitual residence, center of interests, family ties, participation in public life and other evidence of attachment.*\"1065\n\n*Case No. A/18*, IUSCT Case No. A/18, Decision No. DEC 32-A18-FT, (April 6, 1984), p. 12, **Exhibit RLA-8**.\n\n551.\n\nIn reference to the critical dates in which dominant and effective nationality should be assessed, the Italian \u2013 United States Commission has determined that \"[t]*he question of dual nationality obviously arises only in cases where the claimant was in possession of both nationalities at the time the damage occurred and during the whole period comprised between the date of the Armistice (September 3, 1943) and the date of the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace (September 15, 1947)*\"1066 The Iran \u2013 United States Claims Commission has adopted identical criteria concerning relevant factors to be considered from the date in which the claim arose and January 19, 1981.1067\n\n*Merg\u00e9 Case,* Italian-United States Conciliation Commission, Decision No. 55, (June 10, 1955), p. 247, **Exhibit RLA-7** ; The Franco \u2013 Italian Conciliation Commission also decided several claims of dual nationals according to the \"link theory\": *Rambaldi Calim* (France v. Italy) 13 R.I.A.A. 786 (1957); *Menghi Claim* (France v. Italy) 13 R.I.A.A. 801 (1958); *Lombroso Claim* (France v. Italy) 13 R.I.A.A. 804 (1958).\n\n*Case No. A/18*, IUSCT Case No. A/18, Decision No. DEC 32-A18-FT, (April 6, 1984), p. 12, **Exhibit RLA-8**.\n\n552.\n\nOverall, the decisions referred above indicate the need to examine the *connections* and the *closeness* of the bond that an individual has with two countries by virtue of the nationalities held at a pre-determined relevant time. As indicated in Procedural Order No. 2, we consider \"*the State of habitual residence, the circumstances in which the second nationality was acquired, the individual's personal attachment for a particular country, and the center of the person's economic, social and family life*\" as relevant for our analysis.1068 Such elements seem to be pertinent to discern both dominance and effectiveness.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, p. 7.\n\n**(e) The Specific Context of DR-CAFTA for the \"Dominant and Effective Nationality\" Test**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nChapter 10 of DR-CAFTA protects \"investments\" and \"investors\" by providing standards of treatment and allowing recourse in cases of breach by the host State. Its scope is limited to both *fundamental concepts*.1069 \"Substantially increasing investment opportunities in the territories of the Parties\" is one of the objectives of DR-CAFTA, this is reinforced by the resolve stated by the Parties in the Preamble to \"[e]*nsure a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment*\". The fact that the application of Chapter 10 and the obligations enshrined therein depend on the existence of \"investors\" and \"covered investments\", and in particular, on nationality in order to possess the condition of an investor has great meaning. Nationality (and in the case of dual nationals, dominant and effective nationality) is *interrelated* to the concept of investor. There will be no investor within the meaning of Chapter 10 if there is no (dominant and effective) foreign national.\n\n*See* Article 10.1 on Scope and Coverage as well as sections A and B.\n\n554.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal considers that the *investment* itself, the status of *investor* as well as other circumstances surrounding those elements may be relevant factors for assessing nationality and its dominance and effectiveness within Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA. A tribunal may need to examine any factor that may help discern those attributes, for example, the conduct of a particular State towards the investor, how the investor presented himself or herself, or the reason underlying the investor's decision to apply for naturalization.\n\n555.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that a claimant's entire life is relevant but not dispositive when assessing whether nationality is dominant and effective.1070 In cases dealing with double nationality (with one acquired after the other), it would most likely be evident that a person that was born and lived in a particular country during a long period of his or her life will have many attachments, connections and closeness with that country.\n\n*Reza Said Malek v. Iran,* IUSCT, Interlocutory Award, (June 23, 1988), \u00b6 14, **Exhibit CLA-51**.\n\n556.\n\nFor these reasons, a holistic assessment must be performed in order to discern which nationality was dominant and effective at the relevant time considering all the facts of the case. Taking into account a claimant's entire life within the analysis of dominance and effectiveness *at a particular time* does not necessarily entail ascribing more weight to one nationality over the other due to the amount of time each of them has been held. Rather an analysis should be performed to examine how, *at that particular time,* the connections to both States could be characterized in terms of dominance and effectiveness.\n\n557.\n\nAccording to Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA, the Tribunal must then determine if at the time of the alleged breach and ultimately at the time of the submission of the claim, the Claimants' U.S nationality was dominant and effective or if their Dominican nationality fulfilled those attributes, *i.e.* if it was strong enough to take precedence over their U.S. nationality and it was producing effects or was operative during the relevant time in order to determine whether they were investors under DR-CAFTA.\n\n**C. APPLICATION OF THE LEGAL STANDARD TO THE FACTS OF THE CASE**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n558.\n\nThe Claimants have argued that they qualified as investors at the moment of the submission of the claim since they were at all times dominantly and effectively U.S citizens \"*from their birth until today*\".1071 Overall, the Claimants have taken into account the following factors in support of their contention: (i) the center of gravity of their contacts, relationships, and commitments, (ii) their place of birth, (iii) the place where the majority of their lives was spent, (iv) the place of their permanent residence, (v) their personal and professional relationships and (vi) the origin of the capital for their investment.1072 In the Tribunal's opinion, none of those factors exclusively indicate that a particular nationality was dominant and effective. On the contrary and as mentioned above, a *holistic exercise* must be performed in order to discern whether all the relevant factors analyzed indicate that a specific nationality was effective1073 (*i.e*. actually operative and producing effects) as well as dominant (strong enough to take precedence over the other). Although the factors related to the life of the Claimants before they moved and invested in the Dominican Republic are relevant, they should be analyzed with a view to determining their connection with the Dominican Republic and the United States at the relevant times*.*\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 21.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 21; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 154-155.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Respondent does not contest the effectiveness of the Claimants' U.S. nationality when indicating that \"[they] have genuine connections to both States.\" Rejoinder of the Dominican Republic on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 44. *See* also Statement of Defense, \u00b6 27.\n\n559.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the factors mentioned by the Parties can be analyzed within the criteria indicated in Procedural Order No. 2, *i.e.* (a) habitual residence, (b) the individual's personal attachment for a particular country, (c) the center of the person's economic, social and family life, and (d) the circumstances in which the second nationality was acquired, bearing in mind the specific context of this dispute. Additionally, we are called upon to examine the nationality of each Claimant, Mr. and Ms. Ballantine. While the evaluation must be made in relation to each of them, the Tribunal considers that it can be addressed in the specific section of each criterion making the distinction when necessary. We turn now to our examination of the criteria mentioned above in light of the facts of the case.\n\n**1. Habitual Residence**\n-------------------------\n\n560.\n\nWithin this factor, the Tribunal addresses some criteria which the Parties have discussed in their submissions and that relate to each other: In particular: (i) the place of birth, (ii) the place where the majority of the Claimants' lives were spent, and (iii) permanent residence. The Tribunal observes that this factor was considered as an \"*important factor*\"1074 in *Nottebohm*, and that while weighing the connections with Liechtenstein, the ICJ considered, among other circumstances, that there had been \"*no prolonged residence in that country*\" and \"[n]*o intention of settling there was shown*\".1075\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment (April 6, 1955), p. 22, **Exhibit RLA-6**. In that case, the tribunal indicated the relevance of other factors and stressed that their importance would vary from one case to the other.\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment (April 6, 1955), p. 25, **Exhibit RLA-6**.\n\n561.\n\nPlace of birth. The place of birth is not contested. The Claimants were born in the United States. We note that this factor relates to others put forward by the Claimants in order to indicate that their closeness to the U.S. was stronger when submitting their claim. We see nothing that would indicate that, particularly in cases involving acquired double nationality, this factor has a special bearing over other factors in order to determine which nationality is dominant and effective at any critical date.\n\n562.\n\nPlace where the majority of their lives was spent. The Claimants were born in the United States. They also lived in the Dominican Republic for a year in 2000 while working as missionaries and continued to visit the country each year after they returned to the United States in 20011076 ; afterwards, they moved to the Dominican Republic in August 2006.1077 From 2006 to the moment the claim was submitted, the Ballantines lived in the Dominican Republic. While this represents a significant period of time, overall, the Claimants had spent up to that moment the majority of their lives in the United States. The Tribunal considers that the fact that the Claimants spent the majority of their lives in the U.S. evidences that such nationality was exercised. The Tribunal is also aware that during that time span the Claimants created significant connections as a natural consequence of living in their county of birth, connections related to their way of living, personal and professional as well as economic. However, the determination of \"dominant and effective\" may not be reduced to a mathematical \"day counting\" exercise. A further examination is required in order to conclude that such connections remained stronger, at a particular relevant point in time.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 20.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 1-3; First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4, 17.\n\n563.\n\nPlace of permanent residence. The Claimants moved to the Dominican Republic in August 2006. The Tribunal notes that, initially, the Claimants characterized such move as \"permanent\".1078 According to the witness statement of Ms. Ballantine, the Claimants sold two of their homes and commercial real estate in the United States.1079 The Claimants were permanent residents since 2006, however, Mr. Ballantine testified at the hearing that he was first a temporary resident and that by 2008 both he and his wife were permanent residents.1080 Regardless of this discrepancy, the stream of events not only reflects a change in residence made by the Claimants, but also a change in the *status* of such residence to legally reflect *permanency*. The Tribunal views a permanent residence as a decision to settle in a specific place, as a long-standing decision.\n\nNotice of Intent, \u00b6 12.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6 3.\n\nThis declaration arose in relation to Exhibit R-25 which contains permanent residence certificates of Mr. and Ms. Ballantine indicating such status since 2006 and renewed in 2008. Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 477 (English). Exhibit R-16 also contains a sworn statement indicating the Claimants' residence in the Dominican Republic. The Tribunal notes as well that according to the Digest of United States Practice in International Law 1991-1999, published by the International Law Institute under agreement with the United States Department of State, Office of the Legal Adviser, residence and other voluntary associations are important factors for the \"dominant and effective\" nationality determination: \"These tests should be used to determine the dominant, effective nationality of the applicant in question. The primary question to be asked is what nationality is indicated by the applicant's residence or other voluntary associations. A second question is whether the applicant has manifested an intention to be a national of one of the two States, while also seeking to avoid or terminate nationality in the other. Of these two questions, the former will ordinarily be the more important\". (Emphasis added), **Exhibit RLA-10**, p. 36.\n\n564.\n\nThe Claimants have argued that they continuously maintained at least one residence and sometimes two in the United States.1081 It seems clear to the Tribunal that during the period of time that the Claimants lived in the Dominican Republic there was no attempt to renounce completely to residential connections in the United States since a fair amount of time was also spent in such country. Nevertheless, this standard does not seem to require renouncement of one nationality over the other. This does suggest however that the Claimants continued maintaining connections to the United States despite their permanent residence being officially in the Dominican Republic.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 37.\n\n565.\n\nAs to the amount of time spent in each country, Mr. Ballantine clarified in his witness statement the number of days that Ms. Ballantine spent outside the Dominican Republic from 2010 to 2014 and from those days how many were spent in the U.S. From this examination, it seems that in 2010 and 2011 most of Ms. Ballantine's days were spent in the United States while in 2012, 2013 and 2014 she spent more days in the Dominican Republic. Overall, the majority of her days between 2010 and 2014 were spent in the Dominican Republic. On the other hand, Mr. Ballantine indicated that he \"*travelled just slightly less* [*\u2026*] *but he joined* [Lisa] *on almost every return to the United States*\".1082 We consider that if Mr. Ballantine travelled less, then most likely he would have spent at least the same amount of days in the Dominican Republic as Ms. Ballantine over the same period.\n\nSupplemental Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 21. According to this information, in 2010 Ms. Ballantine spent 101 days in the Dominican Republic, 145 days in the United States and 119 in other places. In 2011 she spent a close amount of days both in the Dominican Republic and in the United States, 159 in the former and 162 in the latter, as well as 44 days in other places. In 2012, she spent 192 days in the Dominican Republic, 98 days in the United States and 75 days in other places. In 2013 she spent 238 days in the Dominican Republic and 127 in the United States. In 2014 she spent 213 days in the Dominican Republic, 109 in the United States and 43 days in other places.\n\n566.\n\nAlthough the number of days spent in each country may confirm that the Claimants split significant amounts of time between two countries and consequently resided at times in both countries, their legal status, at least from 2008 until the moment they became Dominican nationals in 20101083 was as *permanent residents* of the Dominican Republic and being nationals from 2010 to 2014, most of their time was spent in that country. We view this evidence as confirming the legal status the Claimants voluntarily chose to acquire. Consequently, although the Claimants maintained ties with the United States, their permanent residence at the relevant time was centered in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe Claimants have indicated that they obtained the Dominican nationality in 2010. According to Exhibit R-18, such nationality was approved by Presidential Decree No. 931-09 issued on December 30, 2009.\n\n**2. The Individual's Personal Attachment for a Particular Country**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nPersonal and professional relationships. As mentioned above, the Tribunal is aware that the majority of the Claimants' lives was spent in the United States, which consequently would entail deep connections of different types. The Claimants argue that certain factors such as education or religion should be taken into account in order to determine that their dominant and effective nationality was of the United States.1084\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 40-45.\n\n568.\n\nThe Claimants were educated in the United States. They further argue that although two of their children attended school in Jarabacoa, they did so at an American school. The Tribunal does not view the fact that the Claimants' children attended a school in Jarabacoa as a fact necessarily indicating that the Claimants' dominant and effective nationality was Dominican.1085 This would seem to be a decision logically derived from the fact that the Claimants' residence changed. The fact that the school their children attended was American could indicate their intention to maintain their children closer to the U.S. in terms of language, education and relations within the new community they were already integrating to. Mr. Ballantine has asserted that their children \"*attended an American school* [\u2026] *The classes are taught predominantly in English by United States citizen teachers. All of our children have primarily pursued their education in the United States*\" and Ms. Ballantine has indicated that \"*we* [\u2026] *enrolled our children in the new American school. This would give us the opportunity to work there and to give the kids consistency with their education*\".1086 The Claimants have also stated that they attended an American church1087 and that their home was not a Dominican home in which English was the language spoken at all times.1088\n\nThe Respondent indicated in its Statement of Defense that: \"The Ballantines \u2026 sent their two youngest children to school there.\" Statement of Defense, \u00b6 41.\n\nSupplemental Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 24; Second Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6 3.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 45.\n\n569.\n\nWhilst this may have been the case and it certainly could indicate a desire to keep connections with the United States and their sentiment of belonging, the Claimants did move to and lived in the Dominican Republic for a significant period of time, eight years up to the moment their claim was submitted. They started a business there (in the case of Ms. Ballantine she established a factory for her non-profit organization) which they conducted for that period of time and it would be difficult to consider that they did not integrate into the Dominican community during that time without making personal and professional relations of some type. Ms. Ballantine has indicated that she had personal connections in the Dominican Republic although limited1089 and Mr. Ballantine has indicated personal and professional connections as well.1090 The Tribunal also notes that while requesting the Tribunal to assess moral damages the Claimants not only contend that they were forced to abandon the \"*efforts of ten years of hard work*\" but also that \"*they were forced to sell their home and leave their friends and colleagues in the Dominican Republic*\".1091 (Emphasis added)\n\n\"I had American Friends with whom I was a part of a Bible study group \u2026 I had few Dominican friends\". Second Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6 7.\n\n\"Socially, we had very few Dominican friends, but chose to associate almost exclusively with American missionary friends and other American expats. My best friends were Americans who I met with several times a week. My Dominican relationships were with employees as they related to la Jamaca de Dios, as well as customers on a professional level. Supplemental Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 5.\n\nAmended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 322.\n\n570.\n\nMr. Ballantine has expressed that \"*we developed a deep love and passion for the people and culture of this beautiful island*\"1092 and\n\nI can't deny that I have sentiment for the Dominican Republic and there was good experiences and, you know, that there was positive things in the Dominican Republic. It wasn't like it was all conspiracy and bad and evil. There was good times and, you know, there's some very nice people. So, I can't deny that.1093\n\nJamaca de Dios Website, \"History\" Page, **Exhibit R-11**, p. 1.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 483 (English).\n\n571.\n\nMs. Ballantine has expressed as well that they \"*love the Dominican Republic, it is* [their] *country,* [she is] *Dominican now and* [they] *invest*[ed] *everything here and* [they] *feel like a pain, like rejection*\".1094 For the Tribunal these elements indicate personal attachment for the Dominican Republic. However, there seems to be some contradiction with other statements provided by the Claimants in this regard. Ms. Ballantine has indicated that her \"*cultural connection to the* [Dominican Republic] *was limited*\"1095 and Mr. Ballantine stated that they \"*did very little to even try to assimilate with Dominican culture*\",1096 \"*I did not integrate with the culture. I was an investor*\",1097 \"[t]*here's some relationships, some people I still keep in contact with. But there's nothing cultural that's been enduring whatsoever*.\"1098\n\nTranscript of \"Nuria\" Report (June 29, 2013), **Exhibit C-25**.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6 7.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 89.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 480 (English).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 486 (English).\n\n572.\n\nThe Claimants have provided evidence from the years 2012 to 2014 in which they state: \"[t]*hey really have no idea how their perpetual actions, and threats has devastated us and our desire to continue in their country* [\u2026] *I cannot wait to get out of this place*\",1099 \"*I haven't really made friends here in the DR.

Ballantine (November 19, 2013), **Exhibit C-164**.\n\n573.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants had personal connections or attachment to both the United States and the Dominican Republic during the relevant period. We are aware that the extent of such connections is difficult to measure objectively, particularly to the extent there have been some contradictory statements. In terms of professional relations, the Claimants seem to have been more connected to the Dominican Republic by virtue of their investment, however, it appears to this Tribunal that, although the Claimants had personal and professional attachments to the Dominican Republic, the attachments to the U.S. seem to be of equal force.\n\n**3. The Center of the Person's Economic, Social and Family Life**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n574.\n\nIn their Notice of Arbitration as well as in their Amended Statement of Claim, the Claimants mention within the jurisdictional issue that the \"*entirety of the capital* [\u2026] i *nitially invested in Jamaca de Dios originated in the United States*\".1101 They also contend that they have continued to maintain financial connections to the United States.1102\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 21; Amended Statement of Claim, \u00b6 155.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 34.\n\n575.\n\nAccording to the facts and evidence presented before this Tribunal, the Claimants have financial connections to both the United States and the Dominican Republic. Regarding the U.S., they both maintained a checking account, Mr. Ballantine maintained an individual retirement account, Ms. Ballantine established a non-profit organization named Filter Pure, Inc and they established another non-profit organization named Jesus For All Nations, even though the purpose of this non-profit entity was to distribute innovative water filters throughout the Dominican Republic and Haiti.1103 In the case of the Dominican Republic Mr. Ballantine maintained also accounts in Dominican banks, both had saving accounts and accounts related to Jamaca de Dios, and a factory was established in relation to Ms. Ballantine's non-profit organization.1104 Regarding the origin of the capital initially invested, we do not consider such factor has a lot of weight since the capital was invested to create Jamaca de Dios.\n\n*See* Chase Account Confirmation for Account #1110017084988, **Exhibit C-81** ; Ameritrade Account Statements, **Exhibit C-82** ; Filter Pure Inc., Articles of Incorporation (February 26, 2008), **Exhibit C-83** ; Jesus For All Nations, Tax Return (2010), **Exhibit C-84** ; Account Balance Summary, Michael J Ballantine and Lisa M Ballantine (October 2014), **Exhibit R-236** ; Account Balance Summary, Michael J Ballantine and Lisa M Ballantine (May 2013), **Exhibit R-237** ; College Savings Account Records (undated), **Exhibit R-238** ; Account Balance Summary, Jamaca de Dios (December 2010), **Exhibit R-239;** Account Balance Summary, Michael J Ballantine and Lisa M Ballantine (June 2012), **Exhibit R-241**.\n\n*See* Certification, Asociaci\u00f3n La Vega Real de Ahorros y Pr\u00e9stamos (January 15, 2013), **Exhibit R-215** ; Letter from Banco BHD to M.

According to the facts of the case, the Claimants moved to the Dominican Republic in 2006 and made a significant investment creating Jamaca de Dios, a luxury residential community; in order to do this, they sold two of their homes and commercial real estate1105. Therefore, the reason for moving to the Dominican Republic was to *establish Jamaca de Dios*1106 and although they maintained connections to the United States, it seems to the Tribunal that from 2006 to the moment the claim was submitted, the Claimants had moved or relocated their economic center and their family center to the country where they resided permanently, independently of the fact that they often visited the United States, that their children continued their education in the U.S or that they kept social relations in the U.S. The fact is that the Claimants established what appeared to be their \"main\" business in the Dominican Republic1107 and reorganized their way of living in the Dominican Republic for several years around the investment. In consequence, this Tribunal is of the view that the Dominican Republic was the center of their economic, family and social life, despite maintaining ties with the U.S.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 6, 10-16. \"It was a significant undertaking which took time and money\". *Ibid*, \u00b6 17.\n\nMs. Ballantine also established a factory for her Filter Pure non-profit. *See* First Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6 5. According to Mr. Ballantine, \"we wanted to live in the complex to show that we had a 100% commitment to what we were doing\". The Claimants also built a successful restaurant. *See* First Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 23, 24, 26. \"[O]ur investment in Jamaca de Dios required Lisa and I to reside in the Dominican Republic\". Supplemental Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 7.\n\n577.\n\nAlthough Ms. Ballantine indicated that the original plan was to manage the investment from Chicago but that they realized the project would need more direct oversight,1108 they moved to Jarabacoa because of the investment. She characterized Mr. Ballantines work as \"*largely in the DR*\" while hers \"*largely outside the DR*.\"1109 The Tribunal is aware that Ms. Ballantine's non-profit organization resulted in her traveling more often, however, she still resided permanently in the Dominican Republic, established a factory there and most of her days were spent in that country. She also stated that in the Dominican Republic, she worked and partnered with local NGOs and was responsible for raising money and distributing filters manufactured in the factory established therein and that she helped administer the Jamaca de Dios Foundation.1110 All of these elements support our conclusion that the center of the Claimants' economic, social and family life was in the Dominican Republic, a connection stronger to the one maintained with respect to the U.S throughout the relevant times.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6 3.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6 4.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.\n\n**4. Naturalization**\n---------------------\n\n578.\n\nThe Claimants voluntarily acquired, through naturalization, the Dominican nationality on December 30, 2009.1111 In addition, they made the relevant citizenship requests for two of their children, for whom they stated formally to the authorities: \"[w]*e want the Dominican citizenship to be granted to them as well since they comply with all the requirements according to the Law and we feel very identified with the sentiment and Dominican customs since we have had a close bond of coexistence and respect*\".1112 The Tribunal notes that a similar statement was provided in relation to the Claimants' naturalization process.1113\n\nPresidential Decree No. 931-09 (December 30, 2009), **Exhibit R-18**.\n\nJosiah and Tobi Ballantine's Naturalization File, **Exhibit R-36**, p. 24 (Unofficial translation). The Tribunal takes note that during the hearing, Mr. Ballantine indicated that his wife chose to be a Dominican citizen \"Reluctantly\". Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 478 (English).\n\nLetter from Griseldi Rafael Rodriguez to the President of the Dominican Republic (December 11, 2009), **Exhibit R-17** This exhibit contains a letter sent by the Claimants' lawyer in which naturalization is requested for both of them due to the fact that they comply with the requirements established in the Law and they \"identify with the sentiment and Dominican customs as they have had a close bond of coexistence and respect with our country, therefore they would be pleased to legally confirm, their Dominican sentiment\". Unofficial translation.\n\n579.\n\nIn *Nottebohm*, the ICJ took the view that naturalization, as opposed to other factors which it considered merely illustrative, would always be a relevant factor. Hence, it considered that \"[n]*aturalization is not a matter to be taken lightly. To seek and to obtain it is not something that happens frequently in the life of a human being*\".1114 We agree with this last statement. Naturalization is an important event in a person's life. It creates a particular bond to a country that certainly has legal consequences, and thus, should not be taken lightly. In this case, the ICJ asserted the \"*profound significance*\" and \"*the serious character*\" of such procedure and took into account within its examination that \"*naturalization was not based on any real prior connection with Liechtenstein, nor did it in any way alter the manner of life of the person upon whom it was conferred*\".1115 Furthermore, it considered that:\n\n[i]n order to appraise its international effect, it is impossible to disregard the circumstances in which it was conferred, the serious character which attaches to it, the real and effective, and not merely the verbal preference of the individual seeking it.1116 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment (April 6, 1955), p. 24, **Exhibit RLA-6**.\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment (April 6, 1955), p. 26, **Exhibit RLA-6**.\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment (April 6, 1955), p. 24, **Exhibit RLA-6**.\n\n580.\n\nThis would, in fact, suggest that naturalization is also a key component to be analyzed within the dominant and effective nationality test. The Tribunal observes that in *Nottebohm*, naturalization was understood as involving \"*breaking of a bond of allegiance and* [the] *establishment of a new bond of allegiance*\". This does not seem to be expected or foreseen by DR-CAFTA. If that were the case, the dominant and effective nationality test would not serve its purpose in the event that an individual possessed two nationalities, one acquired after the other one. This would be the case since a \"breaking of allegiance\" would actually imply the existence of only one nationality, the nationality with respect to which a new bond of allegiance is established. As mentioned above, dual nationality does not seem to be a matter of extinguishing one bond in favor of another but of assessing the qualities that characterize those bonds in terms of strength and effectiveness.\n\n**5. The Reason to be Naturalized as Dominicans**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n581.\n\nThe Claimants have asserted that they applied to be naturalized in order to protect their investment and avoid discrimination.1117 In his witness statement, Mr. Ballantine indicated the decision to naturalized as Dominicans was made for \"*asset protection*\"1118, to \"*protect our investment and to minimize government obstruction, as well as any perceived biases in the market*\".1119 In her witness statement, Ms. Ballantine indicates her reason for becoming a Dominican Republic citizen was \"*to protect our investment in case of our demise. I was concerned that our children could lose the entire investment if were we to die*\".1120 During the hearing, Mr. Ballantine was asked the reason for taking the decision to become a national of the Dominican Republic, to which he responded:\n\nYes. Primarily, at that time I thought that I owned a very valuable piece of property in the mountains of the Dominican Republic. And I felt very insecure, in case of my demise or my wife's, what would happen through an arbitrary court ruling or my children having to pick up the pieces, and I thought that it might help protect our estate*.* Secondly, I felt like it was important for a business decision in order for the commercial aspects*.* There were oftentimes people that wouldn't buy from me, for example, because they didn't think that I was committed and they were afraid to buy from a gringo and they would feel more comfortable. And so I lost sales. It was a very simple process. There was no renunciation of anything. I lost nothing as a United States citizen, and I just simply became a Dominican citizen. And from my understanding, I gained no other right other than the right to vote. And so that was-- it was only-- had to do with economics and it had to do with estate protection*.* I did not integrate with the culture. I was an investor*.* And we spent most of our time, as much as possible, away.1121 (Emphasis added)\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 13.\n\nSupplemental Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 3.\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 88.\n\nSecond Witness Statement of Lisa Ballantine, \u00b6 15.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 479-480 (English).\n\n582.\n\nThe Tribunal considers this criterion is directly related to the objective of investment protection. As already mentioned, we agree with the tribunal in *Nottebohm* in that \"[n]*aturalization is not a matter to be taken lightly. To seek and to obtain it is not something that happens frequently in the life of a human being*\".1122 Naturalization is an important event. A serious event with legal consequences that should not be taken slackly. It appears that the Claimants' understanding on naturalization was different. This would seem evident from Mr. Ballantine's statement above regarding what Dominican nationality entailed. Furthermore, the Claimants took this step for two of their children.1123 However, that same step did not seem to have the same connotation for the Claimants either.1124\n\n*Nottebohm Case (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase*, ICJ, Judgment (April 6, 1955), p. 24, **Exhibit RLA-6**.\n\nJosiah and Tobi Ballantine's Naturalization File, **Exhibit R-36**.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Ballantine expressed the following in response to the question of whether his children were naturalized: \"My two oldest were not. My two youngest were--were on their way out, and I said, 'Hey, do you guys want to become Dominican too? I can get you a passport for a souvenir.' That's all it was. There was no commitment. It was just like, 'Hey, you guys can have a passport too, because we're Dominicans.' That was the extent of the conversation, like, 'Yeah, I'll take one.' That was it.\" Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 480 (English).\n\n583.\n\nNaturalization bestows an individual with a set of rights and obligations and creates a particular bond between the individual and the State. In this Tribunal's view, naturalization should not be equated to the purchase of a good or service. Regardless of this, the naturalization by the Claimants as Dominicans produced effects and altered their condition as only U.S. nationals during a period relevant for the application of DR-CAFTA Chapter 10. As mentioned above, Chapter 10 protects foreign \"investments\" and \"investors\". It is not designed nor meant to be applied to citizens of the host State, at least not when their dominant and effective nationality is that of the host State. Therefore, this Tribunal finds relevant the fact that the main reason for the Claimants to acquire a second nationality was the *investment directly related to this proceeding.*\n\n584.\n\nWhilst the Claimants have mentioned that discriminatory treatment was one of the reasons for becoming Dominican, the Claimants have expressed that their motives were for protection *of the investment*, as a business decision for commercial aspects, an economic decision. The sole reason for becoming Dominican and *domestic investors* was *the investment*. The Tribunal finds trouble reconciling the fact that the Claimants' desire was to be viewed as Dominicans for purposes of bolstering their investment and yet, regarding the application of the protections designed for foreign investors, they contend such nationality is not as important.\n\n**6. Conduct of the Host State and Other Authorities**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n585.\n\nThe Claimants have also argued that a relevant factor is how the United States and the Dominican Republic viewed them. Particularly, the Claimants consider the fact that U.S. diplomatic officials advocated on their behalf as evidence of their dominant and effective nationality.1125 We do not consider this is the case. In the Tribunal's opinion, the actions of diplomatic officials do not imply that an assessment was made as to which nationality is dominant and effective. This is particularly true when there is no evidence that authorities knew or could have known that the person involved had another nationality.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 59-70.\n\n586.\n\nIn this regard, we note that in its submission under Article 10.20.2, the United States actually indicated that: \"*it does not take a position in this submission on how the interpretation offered below applies to the facts of this case, and no inference should be drawn from the absence of comment on any issue not addressed below.*\"1126 It also indicated that \"*where U.S. embassies or consulates provide facilitative assistance to U.S. nationals abroad in connection with disputes between those nationals and other countries, such officials typically do not make a legal determination with respect to a dual national's dominant and effective nationality in order to provide such assistance*.\"1127 As to the Respondent, this Tribunal considers that the involvement of agencies in charge of foreign investment do not equate to a determination of dominant and effective nationality. In the Tribunal's opinion the evidence does not indicate that U.S. Embassy officials or officials in the agency responsible for foreign investment in Dominican Republic were aware of the Claimants' dual nationality.\n\nSubmission of the United States, \u00b6 1.\n\nSubmission of the United States, p. 2, fn. 1.\n\n587.\n\nAs mentioned above, the dual nationality test does not require a person to renounce their citizenship and it would seem that officials treated them as foreign investors when they presented themselves that way. Regarding the consequences prescribed in Dominican domestic law, which may result in a person losing such citizenship, we do not view such factor as relevant to determine the effectiveness and dominance of such a bond. The fact is that the bond exists.1128\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 71-75.\n\n**7. How the Claimants Presented Themselves**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n588.\n\nThe Ballantines presented as evidence the contracts from the lot sales in Phase 1 of Jamaca de Dios.1129 They contend that a more compelling fact regarding those sales is that every lot sale was conducted in U.S. dollars. The Tribunal does not consider this fact to be as compelling as the Claimants do in terms of nationality. Particularly since a fair amount of the contracts indicate \"*or its equivalent in RD*\" after the price of sale is determined in U.S. dollars. The Tribunal could also locate a small amount of contracts in which quantities in Dominican Republic Pesos were established.1130\n\nJamaca de Dios Lot Sales - Phase 1, **Exhibit C-162**.\n\nJamaca de Dios Lot Sales - Phase 1, **Exhibit C-162**.\n\n589.\n\nThe Exhibit presented by the Claimants contains contracts certified by a public notary. From those contracts, the Tribunal could identify 77 specific contracts signed by Mr. Ballantine in representation of \"Jamaca de Dios Jarabacoa, C. por A.\" Those contracts were not signed by Mr. Ballantine in a personal capacity, but on behalf of the company (*i.e.* the investment) as president. The Tribunal observes that in those contracts, Mr. Ballantine identifies himself as national of both the United States and the Dominican Republic in five cases, as Dominican in 41 and as U.S national in 31. Moreover, from those 31 contracts 19 were signed in the years 2006-2009 before the Claimant had gone through the process of naturalization, therefore, there was only one nationality that he could present: the American. In the rest of the contracts, he presented himself as U.S. national even though he had already acquired the Dominican nationality, *i.e.* in 12 contracts signed mostly in 2010 and 2011 and one in 2013.\n\n590.\n\nOn the other hand, the contracts in which Mr. Ballantine identified himself as Dominican, were signed between 2010 and 2015, *i.e.* Mr. Ballantine continued to present himself as Dominican even after the claim was submitted. The Respondent also presented evidence in this regard,1131 in which the number of contracts signed by Mr. Ballantine as Dominican is also higher. We consider this evidence to be relevant in showing his Dominican nationality *prevailed* over the times he presented himself as U.S national in formal acts directly related to the investment.\n\nTable of Nationalities Used in Jamaca de Dios Sales Contracts, **Exhibit R-290**. This Table appears to have been elaborated based on the contracts presented in R-209. Although the table includes cases in which Mr. Ballantine presented himself only as U.S national, as well as both Dominican and American, the numbers are significantly lower than the ones presented according to Exhibit C-162.\n\n591.\n\nRegarding Ms. Ballantine, the evidence presented does not involve her directly since the contracts were signed by Mr. Ballantine as president of Jamaca de Dios. Mr. Ballantine's actions seem to confirm his statements regarding the investment being the reason to apply for naturalization as Dominican and it would appear to have been a conscious decision of both Claimants as addressed below. Therefore, the Tribunal is not fully convinced that the fact that Ms. Ballantine did not sign contracts necessarily means that she did not apply for Dominican naturalization for the investment or that it was not a business decision for Jamaca de Dios which involved her.\n\n592.\n\nAnother way in which the Claimants have presented themselves in terms of nationality is through the use of the official document issued by each State to attest for the nationality of its citizens, that is, through the use of their passport. The Respondent presented the Claimants' migration records for the years 2010 to 2014.1132 According to those records, the Claimants entered to the Dominican Republic mostly as nationals by way of their Dominican passport and exited the country with their American passport.\n\nMigratory Records for Michael and Lisa Ballantine (August 25, 2016), **Exhibit R-19**.\n\n593.\n\nAlthough the Claimants have argued that the Dominican passport was not used when travelling internationally, but only when entering the Dominican Republic,1133 we recall that nationality establishes a legal connection between a State and a person. The Tribunal takes note that Mr. Ballantine's view on the Dominican passport itself, expressed in the hearing, differs. At the hearing, Mr. Ballantine indicated:\n\nThe only travel benefit that we ever received was--which is the same right afforded to a resident--is that I pay a $10 entrance tax or be penalized for staying in the country too long. But that same right is given to residents as well\u2026 Yes. We saved $10. You're correct.1134\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 38-40.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 481 (English).\n\n594.\n\nDominican records show that only on two and three occasions, did Mr. and Ms. Ballantine, respectively, enter the Dominican Republic as Americans. In 25 and 30 occasions they entered with their Dominican passports, respectively. On the other hand, they exited the country more often as Americans on 21 and 30 occasions. The numbers seem closely even, which suggests the Claimants' intention to be recognized as Dominicans when entering the country as well as Americans when leaving the country towards the United States. This line of thinking would not change the fact that they represented themselves more often as Dominicans before the Dominican authorities. We do not consider the fact that such representation was being made so to speak \"domestically\" to be less valid.1135\n\nAccording to the exhibits submitted, Mr. Ballantine also presented himself as Dominican before a local court as Claimant in a domestic procedure. *See* Hearing Minutes, La Vega Tribunal de Tierras (September 12, 2013), **Exhibit R-26** ; Hearing Minutes, La Vega Tribunal de Tierras (November 21, 2013), **Exhibit R-27**.\n\n595.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers relevant the fact that the Claimants presented themselves as nationals, *e.g.* when voting.1136 The Claimants have argued that this fact does not support that their Dominican nationality was dominant since they also voted in the U.S. elections in 2014.1137 The Tribunal agrees that the evidence presented on this factor does not reflect a preference for Dominican nationality, however, it does not consider that it reflects preference for the American nationality either.\n\nJarabacoa Voting Records, **Exhibit R-20**.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 43, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, \u00b6 55; Supplemental Witness Statement of Michael Ballantine, \u00b6 26.\n\n596.\n\nThe Claimants have also argued that *\"after the Ballantines became naturalized Dominican citizens, they applied [to] have Jamaca de Dios registered as a foreign investment under the Dominican Foreign Investment Law 16-95*.\"1138 (Emphasis in original) However, such procedure was not completed.1139 The Claimants contend that they were \"*awaiting approval of their Phase 2 permitting request*\" but that their application confirms their intention \"*to return the anticipated profits* [\u2026] *to the United States, their dominant nationality*\". We do not consider these facts to evidence that the Claimants' request relates to their perception of the United States as their dominant and effective nationality. The facts of the case indicate that although they submitted such request, the procedure was never completed, which could also prove a point regarding Dominican nationality contrary to the Claimants' assertions.\n\nResponse to the Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 45.\n\nAccording to Exhibit R-224, the procedure was suspended.\n\n**D. CONCLUSION**\n-----------------\n\n597.\n\nHaving analyzed the evidence and arguments put forward by the Parties, while this Tribunal cannot deny the fact that during the relevant period, the Claimants maintained connections to the United States and this also seems natural from the fact that they were born and lived in that country for the majority of their lives, in this Tribunal's opinion, during the relevant period the Dominican nationality was effective and took precedence over the American nationality. Although the Claimants maintained residential connections to the United States, their permanent residence was in the Dominican Republic, overall, most of their days from 2010 to 2014 were spent in the Dominican Republic, they changed their status to permanent residents and later to Dominican citizens.\n\n598.\n\nWhile their personal and professional relations to the Dominican Republic may have been limited, it is difficult to deny that during that period of time their investment kept them economically centered in the Dominican Republic. In the case of Ms. Ballantine, although she managed her non-profit organization and travelled more, she still was resident and established herself in the Dominican Republic. Both of the Claimants continued with their life in the Dominican Republic. Moreover, both of them voluntarily decided to change their status of permanent residents to a status of nationals because of the investment, whether such decision may have entailed different consequences in their mind, they decided to change their status to be viewed as Dominicans and treated as Dominicans. They presented themselves as Dominicans. That nationality was key to their business.1140\n\nJamaca de Dios Website, \"History\" Page, **Exhibit R-11**.\n\n599.\n\nIn sum, the Claimants' motivation for taking on the Dominican nationality was said to be economic and commercial in nature, for their business and the substantial investment they had made. During that relevant period of time, they lived, ran a business and accepted to be viewed as Dominicans. Nationality was not forced upon them, it was requested1141 and accepted by them. It is not the intention of this Tribunal to assert that the Claimants ceased to be Americans or that they did not have connections to that country. As already indicated, acquired dual-nationality is not about renouncing one nationality or ceasing to have connections with one's country of origin.\n\nLetter from the Dominican Ministry of Interior re Lisa Ballantine (October 7, 2009), **Exhibit R-13** ; Letter from the Dominican Ministry of Interior re Michael Ballantine (October 7, 2009), **Exhibit R-14**. *See* also Record of Swearing-In of Michael Joseph Ballantine (November 18, 2010), **Exhibit R-33** ; Record of Swearing-In of Lisa Ballantine (November 18, 2010), **Exhibit R-34** ; Michael Joseph Ballantine's Naturalization Files, **Exhibit R-38** ; Lisa Ballantine's Naturalization Files, **Exhibit R-39**.\n\n600.\n\nThus, the Tribunal considers that their Dominican nationality took precedence during the relevant times, i.e., at the time the alleged measures were taken and at the time of the submissions of the claim. Therefore, the Claimants do not qualify as investors of a Contracting Party in accordance to the definition set forth in Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA.\n\n**XI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n601.\n\nThe Parties' respective positions on costs are summarized in Section IX. Each Party requested the Tribunal to order the other Party to pay all the costs and fees related to this dispute.\n\n602.\n\nPursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal will first fix the costs of the arbitration and later proceed to apportion those costs between the Parties, in accordance with Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n**A. FIXING THE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION**\n------------------------------------------\n\n603.\n\nArticle 40(2)(a) and (b) of the UNCITRAL Rules states that the fees and expenses of the arbitral tribunal must be stated separately as to each arbitrator and fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with Article 41.\n\n604.\n\nThe fees of Ms. Marney Cheek, co-arbitrator amount to USD 110,962.50 and her expenses amount to USD 386.37.\n\n605.\n\nThe fees of Prof. Ra\u00fal Emilio Vinuesa, co-arbitrator, amount to USD 196,687.50 and his expenses amount to USD 9,779.68.\n\n606.\n\nThe fees of Prof. Ricardo Ramirez Hernandez, presiding arbitrator, amount to USD 244,070.60 (plus VAT USD 38,541.30) and his expenses amount to USD 5,629.48.\n\n607.\n\nThe costs of other tribunal expenses, including the costs of ICSID facilities for the Hearing, court reporting in both English and Spanish, simultaneous interpretation, audio and video technicians, live broadcasting of the Hearing, catering, translation, telecommunication, bank charges, printing and courier charges, and others total USD 169,796.13.\n\n608.\n\nPCA fees amount to USD 108,980.36 and its expenses amount to USD 10,073.45.\n\n609.\n\nEach Party paid advances on costs to the PCA in the amount of USD 450,000, i.e. a total advance of USD 900,000. The unexpended balance of the deposit amounts to USD 5,092.59.\n\n610.\n\nIn accordance with Article 10.19(2) DR-CAFTA, the Secretary-General of ICSID acted as appointing authority and the fees incurred in this regard amount to USD 10,000. This fee was paid by the Claimants.\n\n611.\n\nBased on the sum of the above figures the total costs of the arbitration amount to **USD 904,907.41**.\n\n612.\n\nAs for the Parties' respective costs of legal representation and expert assistance, the Claimants' affirm that their costs amount to USD 1,424,852.70 in legal fees and expenses for its arbitration-related counsel; USD 491,898.57 in expert fees and expenses; and USD 131,682.21 in additional expenses.\n\n613.\n\nThe Respondent, in turn, affirms that its costs related to this arbitration amount to USD 2,611,371.56 in legal fees and expenses for its counsel, Arnold & Porter; USD 562,529.26 in expert fees; and USD 7,670.00 and DOP 2,874,522.29 in additional expenses.\n\n614.\n\nConsidering the complexity of this proceeding, the novel issues of fact and law that have arisen in its context, and other relevant circumstances, the Tribunal determines that the Parties' costs are reasonable in accordance with Article 40(2)(e) the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n**B. APPORTIONING THE COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent should pay all the costs and fees of the Arbitration based on the way the Respondent's officials acted.1142 In particular, the Claimants argue that the Respondent's officials \"*took deliberate actions to harm the Ballantines' investment through a barrage of discriminatory, arbitration, and expropriatory measures*.\"1143 In addition, the Claimants contend that the Respondent's Admissibility Submission raised unnecessary costs and that the Claimants should not bear the costs of defending against it.1144\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 560-564.\n\nReply Memorial, \u00b6 561.\n\nResponse to the Objection to Admissibility, \u00b6\u00b6 110-112.\n\n616.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal must grant the Respondent all of the costs of the proceeding, as well as legal fees and expenses, as the Claimants' claims lack jurisdiction and/or merits.1145 The Respondent explains that \"[o]*ther relevant factors also militate in favor of an award of costs and legal fees to the Dominican Republic, including: the fact that the Ballantines do not qualify as \"claimants\"; the fact that their claims are substantively meritless; and the Ballantines' litigation style, which has caused unnecessary expenditures for the Dominican Republic (as for instance due to the Ballantines' constantly changing argumentation; their reformulation of the facts in each round of pleadings; and their willful omissions during document production.)*.\"1146\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 346. *See also* Objection to Admissibility, section IV, \u00b6 4.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, \u00b6 371.\n\n617.\n\nAs already noted by the Tribunal, this dispute was brought by the Claimants in accordance with DR-CAFTA and the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n618.\n\nPursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.26 (\"Awards\"), a tribunal may award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with Section B and the applicable arbitration rules.\n\n619.\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 (\"Conduct of the Arbitration\") provides:\n\nWhen it decides a respondent's objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant's claim or the respondent's objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.\n\n620.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\nThe costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n621.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that these provisions do share a common feature: they grant the Tribunal with discretion to allocate costs and fees between the Parties.\n\n622.\n\nIn light of the above cited provisions, such discretion is qualified, first, by the determination of whether an award on costs is warranted, the claimant's claim is frivolous, and secondly, by the consideration of the particular circumstances of the dispute.1147 In relation to the latter, other tribunals have taken into account: the complexity1148 and novelty1149 of the issues involved, the manner in which the Parties have conducted throughout the arbitration,1150 including any misconduct,1151 and whether the Parties presented solid or meritorious arguments.1152\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that paragraph 3.1 of the Terms of Appointment states that \"[p]*ursuant to Articles 10.16(3)(c) and 10.16(5) of the CAFTA-DR, this arbitration shall be conducted in t to the extent modified by the CAFTA-DR.*\"\n\n*KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v.

Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/3, Award, (April 17, 2015), \u00b6\u00b6 200-201.\n\n623.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal is of the view that these criteria are objective and relevant to inform its decision on costs together with its assessment on whether the claim was \"frivolous\", as established by DR-CAFTA, to determine whether a costs award in favor of the prevailing party is \"warranted\". Moreover, despite providing for a general \"loser pays\" rule, the UNCITRAL Rules empower tribunals to apportion costs by simply determining that apportionment is \"reasonable\". In this case the rules under DR-CAFTA and the UNCITRAL Rules must be read together. If the losing party's claim was not frivolous, the Tribunal has discretion to decide whether there are circumstances in the present dispute that justify a reasonable allocation. The Tribunal also notes that the approaches followed by other tribunals in exercising their power to allocate costs vary from one dispute to another.\n\n624.\n\nThis is the case in the context of arbitrations under the DR-CAFTA. For example, in *RDV v. Guatemala*, the tribunal distinguished between jurisdictional and merits phases and ordered the respondent to bear the costs of the two jurisdictional phases that were rejected and each party to bear 50% of the costs of the merits phase.1153 In *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, the tribunal ordered that each party bear 50% of the arbitration costs and its own legal fees and expenses. In that case, the tribunal determined that \"*neither of the Parties has presented its cases in a way justifying the shifting of arbitral costs against it.*\"1154 In *Pac Rim v. El Salvador*, the tribunal ordered the claimant to pay a proportion of the respondent's legal costs and each party to bear its own share of the arbitration costs.1155 In *Aven and others v. Costa Rica*, the tribunal ordered the claimants to bear all of the arbitrators' fees and expenses, the ICSID administrative expenses and the direct expenses of the arbitration, and each party to bear its own legal costs and expenses.1156 In all of these cases, the tribunals took into account the circumstances at issue rather than applying directly the principle of the \"costs follow the event\".\n\n*Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Award, (June 29, 2012), \u00b6\u00b6 282-283. The Tribunal notes that this case was brought under the ICSID Arbitration rules.\n\n*Corona Materials LLC v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3, Award, (May 31, 2016), \u00b6\u00b6 278-279. The Tribunal notes that this case was brought under the ICSID Arbitration rules.\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Award, (October 14, 2016), \u00b6\u00b6 11.17-11.09, **Exhibit RLA-22**. The Tribunal notes that this case was brought under the ICSID Arbitration rules.\n\n*David R. Aven and others v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/3, Final Award, (September 18, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 765-767.\n\n625.\n\nIn its jurisdictional objection, the Respondent argued that (i) the Ballantines did not qualify as \"Claimants\" as defined under DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 and (ii) their claims do not involve a breach of an obligation under Articles 10.1 to 10.14.\n\n626.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that the Claimants do not qualify as investors of a Contracting Party in accordance to the definition set forth in Article 10.28 of DR-CAFTA, therefore the Respondent has prevailed regarding its preliminary objection. Consequently, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* to assess the merits of the dispute.\n\n627.\n\nThe question that follows for the Tribunal, is whether it is warranted that the Claimant should pay the Respondent all the costs and fees resulted from this dispute or whether costs and fees should be allocated in different portions.\n\n628.\n\nAs a starting point, the Tribunal notes that DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 (\"Conduct of the Arbitration\") demands that the Tribunal determine, in this case, whether the Claimant's claim was \"frivolous\".\n\n629.\n\nIn the present dispute, the nationality issue before the Tribunal was different from others where investment tribunals often face a determination of whether the investor acquired nationality as a means of gaining treaty protection.1157 Most important, the Tribunal noted that this is a case of first impression. In the absence of specific provisions under the DR-CAFTA setting a dominant and effective nationality standard, the Tribunal had to determine the meaning of \"dominant\" and \"effective\" in light of the unique factual circumstances of this case, the context provided for in the DR-CAFTA, its object and purpose, and the applicable rules of international law. In other words, the present dispute involved a complex and novel issue.\n\n*See, e.g.* *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/17, Award, (January 9, 2015), \u00b6 191; *Philip Morris Asia Limited (Hong Kong) v. The Commonwealth of Australia*, PCA Case No. 2012-02, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, (December 17, 2015), \u00b6\u00b6 554, 584; *Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People's Democratic Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, (February 21, 2014), \u00b6 70.\n\n630.\n\nWith regard to the conduct in this arbitration, the Tribunal considers that both Parties have conducted themselves in good faith and presented their arguments in support of their claims or defenses in a professional manner. In the Tribunal's view neither Party caused an undue delay to this proceeding or otherwise had a procedural misconduct.\n\n631.\n\nIn addition, the majority of the Tribunal decided to hear the facts concerning the jurisdictional objection together with the facts concerning the merits. Both Parties submitted extensive arguments on the application of the dominant and effective standard as well as on the merits.\n\n632.\n\nHaving considered the facts of the dispute and the allegations, the majority of the Tribunal does not find elements to consider that such claim was \"frivolous\". In *Commerce Group v. El Salvador*, the tribunal, having ruled in favor of the respondent, considered that to conclude that the claims were \"frivolous\" \"would be to go too far\". The tribunal saw \"*no indication that* [c]*laimants were not serious about the claims they asserted in* [the] *proceedings, nor that the Claimants pursued* [the] *matter in bad faith.*\"1158 In a similar situation, the tribunal in *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic* that decided in favor of the respondent in matters of jurisdiction, stated that \"*the facts surrounding the dispute and the allegations made* [demonstrated] *that the Claimant \u2013 even if it was wrong in the construction and application of the DR-CAFTA to said facts \u2013 had a bona fide claim and did not act with such wanton disregard of the facts and the law as to permit* [the] *tribunal to consider that its claim was 'frivolous'*\"1159.\n\n*Commerce Group Corp. and San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inc. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/17, Award, (March 14, 2011), \u00b6 137.\n\n*Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3, Award on the Respondent's Expedited Preliminary Objections, (May 31, 2016), \u00b6 277.\n\n633.\n\nIn the present case, in the view of the majority of the Tribunal, the Claimants brought a credible case and presented their arguments on jurisdiction in good faith and fairly and they acted professionally during the proceeding1160. Likewise, the Respondent and its counsel also presented their jurisdictional objection in good faith and acted professionally. While the conduct of both Parties is relevant under the UNCITRAL chapeau of relevant circumstances, the inquiry of whether a claim is frivolous under DR-CAFTA must be focused on the losing party. In sum, the majority of the Tribunal considers that the good faith presumption was maintained in the presentation of the claim and the jurisdictional objection,1161 and that the Parties conducted themselves in good faith throughout the proceedings.1162\n\nEven if the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the merits of the case with final and binding effects, the Tribunal has nevertheless heard the Parties' full arguments on the merits; and in the view of the majority of the Tribunal, it cannot avoid having formed a *prima facie* opinion of the case based on the facts and legal arguments alleged by both Parties. In fact, in order to determine whether a claim is frivolous or not, as required by DR-CAFTA, a tribunal must necessarily have an opinion, or otherwise it would simply be a meaningless standard whenever there is no jurisdiction.\n\n*See Chevron Corporation (USA) and Texaco Petroleum Company (USA) v. Republic of Ecuador*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 34877, Provisional Award (December 1, 2008), \u00b6 139, in the context of the burden of proof.\n\n*See* *Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/2, Award, (September 17, 2009), \u00b6 153; *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, Part II, Chapter I, \u00b6 54, **Exhibit CLA-11**.\n\n634.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes the discretion bestowed by the applicable arbitration rules to allocate the costs. In principle, such rules provide that the costs shall be borne by the unsuccessful party, but the Tribunal has authority to apportion such costs in a different manner if it finds that doing so would be reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n635.\n\nNotwithstanding that the Respondent prevailed in the jurisdictional objection and the Tribunal did not have to address the merits, the Claimant presented a *bona fide* claim. Having considered the particular circumstances of this case and in light of the fact that the claim brought was not \"frivolous\", the majority Tribunal finds that it would be reasonable for each party to bear half of the arbitration costs and its own legal fees and expenses incurred in this proceeding. Moreover, the Tribunal does not find any other element which would warrant an award on costs in favour of the Respondent.\n\n636.\n\nWhile each Party has advanced USD 450,000 to the PCA to fund the costs of the proceedings, only the Claimants have paid the costs of the appointing authority (ICSID) in the amount of USD 10,000. Hence, the Respondent owes the Claimants the amount of USD 5,000. As stated above, the unexpended balance in the case deposit amounts to USD 5,092.59. In order to account for an equal distribution of costs, the PCA shall therefore reimburse to the Parties the unexpended balance of the deposit as follows: the amount of USD 5,046.29 to the Claimants, and the amount of USD 46.29 to the Respondent.1163\n\nThe PCA will proceed to return these sums to the Parties once the 30 day period under Articles 37 to 39 of the UNCITRAL Rules has elapsed.\n\n**XII. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n--------------------------------\n\n637.\n\nFor the reasons stated, the Tribunal, by a majority vote, decides to:\n\n*(a)* DECLARE that it lacks jurisdiction over any of the Claimants' claims; and\n\n*(b)* ORDER each Party to bear its own legal costs, and that the common costs of the arbitration shall be borne in equal halves by the Parties."}]}
