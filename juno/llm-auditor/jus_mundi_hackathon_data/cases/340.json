INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis is an arbitration brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States dated 18 March 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\") and the Agreement between the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (the \"BLEU-Algeria BIT\" or the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\").1\n\nAgreement between the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 24 April 1991 (entered into force 17 October 2002), Exh. C-658.\n\n**A. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant**\n-------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l. (the \"Claimant\" or \"OTMTI\"). OTMTI was incorporated in Luxembourg on 24 May 2005.2 Until 29 November 2012, OTMTI was named Weather Investments II S.\u00e0 r.l. (\"Weather II\").3 Its current registered office is at 31-33, Avenue Pasteur, L-2311 Luxembourg.4\n\nWeather II Certificate of Incorporation, 31 May 2005, Exh. C-5.\n\nExtraordinary General Meeting of 29 November 2012, 29 November 2012, Exh. C-240.\n\nSee Claimant's letter to the Tribunal, 1 February 2016. The Claimant's previous registered office was at 1, Boulevard de la Foire, L-1528 Luxembourg. See Weather Investments II S.\u00e1 r.l., Registration of Change of Address (executed 11 December 2012), 11 January 2013, Exh. C-507.\n\n**2. The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria (the \"Respondent\" or \"Algeria\").\n\n**B. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThis overview provides some basic background on the merits of the dispute and puts this Award in context. It is not an exhaustive description of all the events relating to the merits and it essentially relies on the account of the facts in the Claimant's Memorial on the merits, as the Respondent has not submitted pleadings on the merits at this stage.\n\n5.\n\nThis dispute arises from the Claimant's alleged investments to build a mobile telephone system in Algeria.\n\n6.\n\nIn May 2001, Algeria launched a public tender for bids for the award of a second *Groupe Sp\u00e9cial Mobile* License (\"GSM License\") to develop a mobile telecom network for Algeria. The Egyptian company Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E. (\"OTH\", now Global Telecom Holding, \"GTH\") made the winning bid for the GSM License in the amount of US$ 737 million.\n\n7.\n\nOTH began operations through its Algerian subsidiary, Orascom Telecom Alg\u00e9rie S.P.A. (\"OTA\"), in 2002. OTA operated under the brand names *Djezzy* and *Allo*. The Claimant contends that after less than one year in business, OTA had 70% of the GSM market share.5\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 6.\n\n8.\n\nOn 24 May 2005, Weather II, now known as OTMTI, was created and, so it submits, became the ultimate owner of OTA. The Claimant contends that Weather II, along with its subsidiaries (collectively the \"Weather Group\"), continued to make investments in OTA through 2011.6 The Claimant also asserts that between 2008 and 2011, OTA invested US$ 2.7 billion in Algeria and between 2004 and 2007 freely transferred dividends to OTH and its related entities.7\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 7.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 8.\n\n9.\n\nIt is the Claimant's argument that starting from 2008, Algeria began an unlawful campaign against OTA and its investors due to a political vendetta against the Egyptian businessman Naguib Sawiris, the Claimant's ultimate controlling shareholder, and his family and as a result of a policy shift against foreign investment.8 In particular, the Claimant submits that Algeria's measures began in December 2008 through the issuance of tax reassessments for the year 2004, when OTA was tax exempt under its Investment Agreement.9 Subsequently, so the Claimant contends, Algeria used the 2004 tax reassessment to block OTA's dividend transfers to OTH, the Claimant and its related entities.10\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 9-12.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 13-16.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 17-18.\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that in 2009 the Respondent increased the pressure through a massive tax reassessment for the years 2005-2007, when OTA was tax exempt for the majority of this period under its Investment Agreement.11 According to the Claimant, Algeria's measures caused it to incur substantial damage bringing it to the brink of financial collapse.12\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 19-21.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 23-28.\n\n11.\n\nAfter the 2009 events, the Claimant started to pursue exit strategies and engaged consultants to attempt to find a willing buyer for its investment.13 Deals to sell OTA through a sale of OTH's shares were negotiated with South African telecom provider Mobile Telephone Networks Holdings (Proprietary) Limited (\"MTN\") and VimpelCom Limited (\"VimpelCom\"). According to the Claimant, throughout the course of these negotiations, Algeria bombarded OTA with a series of coordinated measures.14 In particular, the Claimant contends that the Respondent demanded full payment of the remaining 2005-2007 tax reassessments within three days over the Easter holiday, knowing that the Weather Group would have had no access to international banks.15 The Claimant further submits that Algeria imposed an injunction freezing all of OTA's bank accounts without prior notice and without any legal or factual basis.16 Moreover, the Claimant contends that a few days after the injunction, Algeria imposed a customs blockade over goods and supplies essential to run OTA's business.17\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 29.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 29.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 30-31.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 32.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 33-35.\n\n12.\n\nOn 28 April 2010, according to the Claimant, Algeria announced that it would expropriate OTA if the Weather Group tried to sell OTA and to evade Algeria's pre-emption right (provided under the \"Supplemental Finance Act\" of 2009).18 As a result, the negotiations with MTN collapsed.19 The Claimant submits that shortly thereafter Algeria forced OTA to shut down its international communications network on \"national security grounds\".20\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 36.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 36.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 36.\n\n13.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, around the time when the Claimant was negotiating with VimpelCom (with a view to achieving OTA's sale through a merger of the Claimant's subsidiary, Weather Investments S.p.A. (\"Weather Investments\"), with VimpelCom), Algeria enacted the 2010 Supplemental Finance Act to attempt to thwart a sale of OTA effected through an upstream foreign entity. The Claimant submits that the effect of such law was that if the Claimant sold shares in any of its foreign companies to effect a sale of OTA, Algeria could buy back OTA's shares for a price selected by valuators chosen by Algeria.21\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 38.\n\n14.\n\nIn September 2010, according to the Claimant, Algeria issued a further provisional notice of tax reassessment for 2008-2009 against OTA in the amount of US$ 230 million.22\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 40.\n\n15.\n\nThe deal with VimpelCom was concluded on 15 April 2011\u2014according to the Claimant, for a substantially impaired consideration of approximately US$ 6,486 billion as a result of Algeria's measures.23 The Claimant sold its indirect shareholding in OTA to VimpelCom by selling its immediate subsidiary, Weather Investments.\n\nMemorial on the Merits, paras. 42-43.\n\n16.\n\nOn 16 April 2012, the Claimant sent a Notice of Dispute under the BIT to the Respondent.24\n\nLetter from Weather II to Algeria, 16 April 2012, Exh. C-30.\n\n17.\n\nOn 19 October 2012, the Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration, accompanied by Exhibits C-1 through C-36 (the \"Request\"). Through this arbitration, the Claimant seeks compensation for the loss it alleges to have incurred on the sale of its indirect interest in OTA to VimpelCom, its share of lost dividends between 2009 and 2011, and damages allegedly caused by Algeria that required the Claimant to obtain bridge loans as a result of the dividend delays and blockade and undertake capital restructurings to prevent the outright collapse of the Weather Group.25\n\nMemorial on the Merits, para. 43.\n\nII. **PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Request was received by ICSID on 24 October 2012. The Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request and transmitted it to the Respondent on 25 October 2012. The Request was supplemented by the Claimant's letter of 14 November 2012.\n\n19.\n\nOn 15 November 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nBy letters exchanged on 12, 18, and 26 December 2012, and 8 January 2013, the Parties confirmed their agreement on the method of constitution of the Tribunal as follows: A Tribunal consisting of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party, and the third, presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n21.\n\nOn 9 January 2013, the Centre acknowledged the Respondent's appointment of Professor Brigitte Stern, a national of France, as arbitrator, and the Claimant's appointment of Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, a Dutch national, as arbitrator. On 24 January 2013, Professor Stern accepted her appointment as arbitrator nominated by the Respondent, and on 25 January 2013, Professor van den Berg accepted his appointment as arbitrator nominated by the Claimant.\n\n22.\n\nOn 31 January 2013, the Claimant informed the Secretariat of a change in its name from \"Weather Investments II S.\u00e0 r.l.\" to \"Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0 r.l.\".\n\n23.\n\nOn 22 March 2013, the Centre informed the Parties that the two party-appointed arbitrators had selected Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as presiding arbitrator.\n\n24.\n\nOn 28 March 2013, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\") notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Aur\u00e9lia Antonietti, ICSID Senior Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal. In addition, with both Parties' agreement, Dr. Michele Potest\u00e0 was designated as Assistant to the Tribunal on 11 October 2013, and a signed declaration was transmitted to the Parties.\n\n25.\n\nOn 16 May 2013, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties in Geneva. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed *inter alia* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, and that The Hague (The Netherlands) would be the place of the proceeding.\n\n26.\n\nAs the Parties did not reach an agreement on the procedural language, they each selected one of the official languages of the Centre as a procedural language in this arbitration (in this case, English for the Claimant and French for the Respondent), in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 22. It was agreed that the orders, decisions, and award of the Tribunal would be rendered and the record kept in both procedural languages (i.e. English and French), both versions being equally authentic.26\n\nAccordingly, in this Award documents submitted in English and French are either referred to in their original language, without translation, or in a free translation made by the Tribunal. For the transcript of the Hearing, the Award refers to the original language.\n\n27.\n\nOn 29 August 2013, the Parties agreed that Paris would be the hearing venue for all hearings in this matter.\n\n28.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 embodying the Parties' agreement on procedural matters discussed during the first session.\n\n29.\n\nOn 20 December 2013, the Claimant filed a Memorial on the Merits with Exhibits C-37 through C-657, and Legal Authorities CLA-1 through CLA-136 (\"Memorial on the Merits\").\n\n30.\n\nOn 24 January 2014, the Respondent filed a Request for the bifurcation of the proceeding with Exhibits R-1 and R-2, and Legal Authorities RL-1 through RL-23.\n\n31.\n\nOn 21 February 2014, the Claimant filed a Response to the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation with Legal Authorities CLA-137 through CLA-162.\n\n32.\n\nOn 26 March 2014, a Hearing on Bifurcation took place by telephone conference.\n\n33.\n\nOn 10 April 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, by which it granted the Respondent's application for the bifurcation of the proceedings between a jurisdictional phase and a merits phase. As a consequence, the proceedings on the merits were suspended.\n\n34.\n\nOn 20 June 2014, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Preliminary Objections with Exhibits R-3 through R-233 and Legal authorities RL-24 through RL-200 (\"Memorial on Preliminary Objections\"), including materials related to the arbitration proceeding before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"PCA\") Case No. 2012-20, also referred to as the \"OTH Arbitration\".\n\n35.\n\nOn 11 August 2014, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal strike all materials related to the OTH Arbitration, including the exhibits submitted by the Respondent on 20 June 2014. The Claimant further requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to disclose all submissions, documents, and exhibits filed in the OTH Arbitration in order to grant the Claimant an equal opportunity to respond to the documents submitted by the Respondent. Additionally, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to disclose the Share Purchase Agreement entered into between VimpelCom, OTH (which had by then changed its name to Global Telecom Holding S.A.E., \"GTH\") and the Algerian *Fonds National d'Investissement* (the \"FNI\") on 18 April 2014 (the \"SPA\").\n\n36.\n\nOn 18 August 2014, the Respondent rejected all of the above Claimant's requests, adding that the disclosure of the SPA was premature.\n\n37.\n\nOn 25 August 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 inviting *inter alia* the Respondent to supplement its letter of 18 August 2014 and setting out a schedule for the Parties' further submissions concerning the OTH Arbitration and the SPA.\n\n38.\n\nOn 26 August 2014, the Claimant requested a modification of the schedule for the submission of its Counter-Memorial. The Respondent commented on 28 August 2014.\n\n39.\n\nOn 29 August 2014, the Tribunal rejected any modification of the schedule for the written submissions.\n\n40.\n\nOn 2 September 2014, the Respondent reiterated that the disclosure of the SPA was premature, and confirmed that it did not have the authorization to produce it.\n\n41.\n\nOn 9 September 2014, the Claimant reiterated its requests formulated in its letter of 11 August 2014.\n\n42.\n\nOn 16 September 2014, the Respondent opposed the Claimant's request to strike the materials relating to the OTH Arbitration from the record.\n\n43.\n\nOn 19 September 2014, the Claimant filed a Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections with Exhibits C-658 through C-854, and Legal Authorities CLA-163 through CLA-227 (\"CounterMemorial\").\n\n44.\n\nOn 1 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, ordering the Respondent to produce to the Claimant by 23 October 2014 all submissions, documents, and exhibits of the record of the OTH Arbitration and the SPA.\n\n45.\n\nOn 24 October 2014, the Respondent produced to the Claimant documents ordered by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 4.\n\n46.\n\nOn 24 October 2014, each Party filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents.\n\n47.\n\nOn 28 October 2014, the Claimant submitted that the Respondent had breached Procedural Order No. 4 and asked that the Tribunal take immediate action. The Respondent answered on 31 October and 3 November 2014. The Claimant replied on 3 November 2014.\n\n48.\n\nGiven that the SPA raised confidentiality issues, the Tribunal noted on 7 November 2014 the Parties' willingness to negotiate a confidentiality agreement and invited them to use their best efforts to conclude a Confidentiality Agreement (\"CA\") by 21 November 2014.\n\n49.\n\nOn 14, 15 and 28 November 2014, and 4 December 2014, the Parties objected to each other's requests for production of documents.\n\n50.\n\nBy letters of 25 November 2014, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had not been able to agree on the terms of a CA.\n\n51.\n\nOn 8 December 2014, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties to discuss the terms of a CA.\n\n52.\n\nOn 12 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 on the Parties' respective requests for document production with corresponding Redfern Schedules, and ordering that documents be produced by 19 December 2014.\n\n53.\n\nOn 12 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, implementing further the confidentiality regime put in place in Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n54.\n\nOn 12 December 2014, the Tribunal further issued Procedural Order No. 7, a confidentiality order regarding the OTH Arbitration record and the SPA.\n\n55.\n\nOn 23 December 2014, with the Parties' consent, the Secretary of the Tribunal wrote to Dr. Brooks Daly, Deputy Secretary-General and Principal Legal Counsel of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, to designate him as Confidentiality Advisor to decide whether certain documents to be produced by the Respondent pursuant to Procedural Order No. 7 contained commercially sensitive information.\n\n56.\n\nOn 6 January 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the OTH Arbitration, which had been previously stayed, had resumed, and that consequently, the discussions with OTH's and VimpelCom's counsel regarding the production of documents from that arbitration into this arbitration had temporarily stopped.\n\n57.\n\nOn 8 January 2015, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to immediately produce the OTH Arbitration record, the Schedules to the SPA (the \"SPA Schedules\"), and the documents concerning the valuation of OTA. Alternatively, the Claimant requested that all references to the OTH Arbitration and the SPA be stricken and that adverse inferences be drawn against the Respondent for its non-disclosure in violation of Procedural Orders Nos. 1, 4, 5, and 7.\n\n58.\n\nOn 21 January 2015, the Respondent contested the Claimant's production of documents made pursuant to Procedural Order No. 5 with regard to the redaction of certain documents relating to Board of Manager Meeting Minutes and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Private Banking Bank statements, and requested that the Tribunal order the Claimant to produce said documents without redactions. The Claimant submitted its observations on 26 January 2015.\n\n59.\n\nOn 30 January 2015, further to the production by the Respondent of the OTH Arbitration record and the SPA Schedules, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order that the Respondent's preliminary objections concerning the OTH Arbitration be deferred until the merits phase of the case. The Claimant further requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to produce documents that had been redacted.\n\n60.\n\nOn 3 February 2015, the Tribunal decided on the Respondent's request of 21 January 2015 concerning the redaction of certain documents.\n\n61.\n\nOn 6 February 2015, the Respondent filed a Reply on Preliminary Objections with Exhibits R-234 through R-1112, and Legal Authorities RL-201 through RL-262 (\"Reply\").\n\n62.\n\nOn 11 February 2015, the Tribunal denied the Claimant's request of 30 January 2015 that certain of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections be joined to the merits.\n\n63.\n\nOn 9 February 2015, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal regarding the redaction of the SPA Schedules, to which the Claimant answered on 16 February 2015. By letter of 18 February 2015, the Tribunal consulted the Parties as to the possible mandate of Dr. Daly if his services were to be required.\n\n64.\n\nOn 3 March 2015, after receiving both Parties' positions, the Secretary informed Dr. Daly that the Tribunal needed his advice as per ICSID's letter of 23 December 2014.\n\n65.\n\nOn 9 March 2015, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to produce documents requested in its request for production of documents, namely the Framework Agreement and the Amended Framework Agreement between Cevital and OTH. The Claimant also requested that the Respondent be ordered to undertake additional searches in relation to Exhibit C-194 and the documents referenced therein.\n\n66.\n\nOn 12 March 2015, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's requests of 9 March 2015.\n\n67.\n\nOn 16 March 2015, the Tribunal denied the Claimant's requests of 9 March 2015.\n\n68.\n\nOn 16 March 2015, the Respondent supplemented its request of 21 January 2015.\n\n69.\n\nOn 17 March 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to submit additional Exhibits R-1113 to R-1123.\n\n70.\n\nOn 18 March 2015, the Claimant requested a three week extension to file its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections.\n\n71.\n\nOn 19 March 2015, Dr. Daly issued a report in which he noted that certain of the SPA Schedules contained \"a mixture of commercially sensitive information and information that is not commercially sensitive\". The Claimant submitted its comments on Dr. Daly's report on 23 March 2015, and the Respondent on 24 March 2015.\n\n72.\n\nOn 23 March 2015, the Claimant filed observations on the Respondent's request to file additional documents dated 17 March 2015.\n\n73.\n\nOn 24 March 2015, the Respondent confirmed that it did not object to the Claimant's request for extension to file its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections. The Respondent also submitted Exhibit R-307, the consent award rendered in the OTH Arbitration.\n\n74.\n\nOn 25 March 2015, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's leave to submit the additional documents mentioned in its letter of 17 March 2015, and granted the Claimant an extension until 24 April 2015 to file its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections.\n\n75.\n\nOn 26 March 2015, the Claimant maintained its request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to undertake additional searches in relation to Exhibit C-194. The Respondent replied on 31 March 2015.\n\n76.\n\nOn 27 March 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would retain Dr. Daly's advice in relation to the Schedules that he found to be \"a mixture of commercially sensitive information and information that is not commercially sensitive\", by requesting that he redact all of the commercially sensitive information contained in the SPA Schedules, and that he review four additional documents, which were produced by the Claimant to the Respondent in redacted form, to determine whether they contained \"commercially sensitive information\".\n\n77.\n\nOn 1 April 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to submit additional Exhibits R-1124 to R-1127.\n\n78.\n\nOn 2 April 2015, Dr. Daly transmitted to the Parties the Schedules with the redactions he made pursuant to the Tribunal's directions of 27 March 2015.\n\n79.\n\nOn 3 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, a Confidentiality Order on Restricted Access Information which further implemented the confidentiality regime put in place in Procedural Orders Nos. 1, 6 and 7. By letter of the same date, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to transmit unredacted copies of all of the SPA Schedules indicated, bearing the designation \"restricted access information\", to the Claimant's counsel by 7 April 2015.\n\n80.\n\nOn 7 April 2015, the Respondent transmitted to the Claimant the unredacted versions of the SPA Schedules, as ordered by the Tribunal on 3 April 2015.\n\n81.\n\nOn 7 April 2015, the Tribunal denied the Claimant's request of 26 March 2015 that the Respondent be ordered to undertake additional searches in relation to Exhibit C-194.\n\n82.\n\nOn 7 April 2015, the Claimant did not object to the filing by the Respondent of new exhibits as per its request of 1 April 2015.\n\n83.\n\nAccordingly, on 9 April 2015, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to submit Exhibits R-1124 to R-1127.\n\n84.\n\nOn 15 April 2015, Dr. Daly issued a further Report, on which both Parties commented on 17 April 2015.\n\n85.\n\nBy letter of 20 April 2015, further to Dr. Daly's Report, the Tribunal ordered the Claimant to transmit to the Respondent unredacted copies of certain documents as well as documents bearing the designation \"restricted access information\" by 21 April 2015.\n\n86.\n\nOn 21 April 2015, the Claimant transmitted to the Respondent the documents ordered by letter of 20 April 2015.\n\n87.\n\nOn 24 April 2015, the Respondent requested leave to submit Exhibits R-118-bis, R-119-bis and R-120-bis.\n\n88.\n\nOn 24 April 2015, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections with Exhibits C-855 through C-1081, and Legal authorities CLA-228 through CLA-268 (\"Rejoinder\").\n\n89.\n\nOn 28 April 2015, the Claimant indicated that it did not oppose the Respondent's submission of its new exhibits.\n\n90.\n\nOn 29 April 2015, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to submit additional Exhibits R-118-bis, R-119-bis and R-120-bis.\n\n91.\n\nOn 3 May 2015, the Respondent filed a request to produce an amended version of Exhibit R-1111.\n\n92.\n\nOn 6 May 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to submit new Exhibits R-1128 to R-1132. On the same date, the Claimant indicated that it did not object to the submission of Exhibit R-1111, subject to certain qualifications.\n\n93.\n\nOn 8 May 2015, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to submit its amended Exhibit R-1111 provided the amended exhibit contained no information that was not already part of the evidentiary record, and that it listed the sources in the record from which the information was derived.\n\n94.\n\nOn 8 May 2015, the Claimant filed a request for leave to submit a new Exhibit C-1082.\n\n95.\n\nOn 10 May 2015, the Tribunal granted leave to the Respondent to submit additional Exhibits R-1128 to R-1132. The Tribunal also granted leave to the Claimant to submit the Exhibit C-1082.\n\n96.\n\nOn 11 May 2015, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n97.\n\nOn 15 May 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 on the organization of the hearing, confirming that a hearing would take place in Paris from 26 to 30 May 2015, and addressing all logistical questions.\n\n98.\n\nOn 15 May 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to submit Exhibits R-1133 to R-1135 (corresponding to the full copies of the exhibits filed by the Claimant as C-935, C-936 and C-937).\n\n99.\n\nOn 16 May 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to produce Legal Authorities RL-263 to RL-267.\n\n100.\n\nOn 18 May 2015 and 19 May 2015, the Claimant opposed the Respondent's request of 15 May 2015 and of 16 May 2015.\n\n101.\n\nOn 19 May 2015, the Tribunal granted leave to the Respondent to submit full copies of the exhibits filed by the Claimant as C-935, C-936 and C-937.\n\n102.\n\nOn 20 May 2015, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's request to submit the additional Exhibits RL-263 to RL-267, as the Respondent had not established that any exceptional circumstances existed warranting the admission of those additional documents.\n\n103.\n\nFrom 26 to 30 May 2015, a hearing on Preliminary Objections took place in the World Bank Offices in Paris (\"Hearing\"). In addition to the Members of the Tribunal, the Secretary and the Assistant to the Tribunal, present at the Hearing were:\n\nFor the Claimant:\n\nMs. Carolyn B. Lamm White & Case LLP\n\nMs. Andrea J.

The letter was sent by ICSID on the same date.\n\n109.\n\nOn 15 June 2015, each Party submitted its respective list of additional international decisions and awards, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 10; namely Legal Authorities CLA-270 to CLA-294 and RL-263 to RL-269, respectively.\n\n110.\n\nOn 22 June 2015, each Party submitted rebuttal authorities; namely Legal Authorities CLA-295 to CLA-299 and RL-270.\n\n111.\n\nOn 30 September 2015, each Party filed its Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n112.\n\nBy letter of 16 October 2015, the Centre transmitted to the Tribunal with copy to the Parties a hard copy of the documents of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* in relation to the BLEU-Algeria BIT, that it had received on 14 October 2015 from Mr. Didier Reynders, Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs of the Kingdom of Belgium.\n\n113.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, the Claimant submitted a complete version of Exhibit C-855.\n\n114.\n\nOn 18 November 2015, each Party filed a Reply Post-Hearing Brief. The Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief was submitted with amended Legal Authority CLA-226.\n\n115.\n\nBy letter of 25 November 2015, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's submission of amended Legal Authority CLA-226.\n\n116.\n\nBy letter of 28 November 2015, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal admit its resubmitted Legal Authority CLA-226 into the record and deny the Respondent's request to submit any responsive legal authorities.\n\n117.\n\nOn 4 December 2015, each Party filed a Submission on Costs (the \"Claimant's Submission on Costs\" and the \"Respondent's Submission on Costs\"). The Claimant filed Legal Authorities CLA-300 through CLA-306.\n\n118.\n\nBy letter of 7 December 2015, the Tribunal took note of the Parties' correspondence of 25 and 28 November 2015 regarding Exhibit CLA-226, and informed them that it would address the objection raised, if at all necessary, in its forthcoming decision or award.\n\n119.\n\nBy letter of 10 December 2015, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's submission of legal authorities with its 4 December 2015 Submission on Costs and asked the Tribunal to strike them from the record. By letter of the same date, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to deny the Respondent's request to strike its new legal authorities from the record. By email of 14 December 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would address the objection raised, if at all necessary, in its forthcoming decision or award.\n\n120.\n\nOn 18 December 2015, each Party filed a Reply on Costs (the \"Claimant's Reply Submission on Costs\" and the \"Respondent's Reply Submission on Costs\").\n\n121.\n\nOn 1 February 2016, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had changed its *si\u00e8ge social* to a new address in Luxembourg.\n\n122.\n\nOn 12 February 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their views on (1) the award issued on 29 January 2016 in *Tenaris S.A. and Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/26 (\" *Tenaris and Talta* \"; available on the ICSID website),27 which discussed, among other issues, the requirement of *si\u00e8ge social* in the BIT applicable in that case, and on (2) the meaning of Article 1(1)(b), and in particular of the term \" *si\u00e8ge social* \", in the Dutch and Arabic versions of the Agreement between the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments.\n\n*Tenaris S.A. and Talta-Trading E Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/26, Award, 29 January 2016 [hereinafter *Tenaris and Talta* ].\n\n123.\n\nOn 11 March 2016, each Party filed its observations. The Claimant also filed Exhibits C-1083 to C-1095. The Respondent filed two annexes.\n\n124.\n\nIn a letter of 13 March 2016, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's comments on jurisdiction *ratione materiae* made in its submission of 11 March 2006. The Respondent objected to that letter on 18 March 2016.\n\n125.\n\nOn 1 and 8 April 2016, the Tribunal clarified that each Party would have the opportunity to file a rebuttal submission, with the possibility of filing relevant additional exhibits and legal authorities and that sur-rebuttal documents with brief explanations would be allowed, to the exclusion of additional expert reports.\n\n126.\n\nOn 21 April 2016, each Party filed a rebuttal submission. The Claimant filed three new Legal Authorities numbered CLA-300 to CLA-302.28 The Respondent filed Exhibits R-1136 to R-1139 and Legal Authorities RL-275 to RL-283.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the exhibit numbers CLA-300 to CLA-302 were used twice for different legal authorities.\n\n127.\n\nOn 28 April 2016, each Party filed a sur-rebuttal submission. The Respondent filed Legal Authorities RL-284 to RL-285.\n\n128.\n\nOn 29 April 2016, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal strike the Claimant's surrebuttal. The Claimant opposed that request on 30 April 2016. The Respondent replied on 3 May 2016.\n\n129.\n\nOn 13 May 2016, the Tribunal took note of the positions expressed in the Parties' letters of 30 April 2016 for the Claimant and of 29 April and 3 May 2016 for the Respondent, and deferred its determination of the Parties' requests to its forthcoming decision or award.\n\n130.\n\nOn 4 October 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that considering the number of the Respondent's preliminary objections and the complexity of some of the objections, the Tribunal expected to be able to complete the drafting of its Decision or Award in early 2017, after which ICSID would have to edit and translate the draft.\n\n131.\n\nOn 31 May 2017, the proceeding was declared closed.\n\n**III. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n----------------------------\n\n132.\n\nPrior to considering the merits of the Parties' positions, the Tribunal will address the scope of this Award (A); the law applicable to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (B); and a number of outstanding requests from the Parties (C).\n\n**A. SCOPE OF THIS AWARD**\n--------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe present proceedings were bifurcated between jurisdiction/admissibility and merits in PO2. The present Award thus addresses the Respondent's preliminary objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the admissibility of the Claimant's claims.\n\n**B. LAW APPLICABLE TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nIt is not in dispute that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention and the BIT, the relevant provisions of which are reproduced below when dealing with each jurisdictional objection.\n\n135.\n\nBoth Parties agree that the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the BIT is governed by the customary international law principles on treaty interpretation as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (\"VCLT\").\n\n136.\n\nIt is also undisputed that the Tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction.29\n\nArt. 41(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**C. OUTSTANDING REQUESTS**\n---------------------------\n\n137.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal resolves a number of outstanding requests from the Parties.\n\n138.\n\nWith regard to the Respondent's request in connection with the Claimant's submission of 28 April 2016,30 the Tribunal decides to strike from the record the Claimant's Sur-Rebuttal to Respondent's 21 April 2016 Submission, dated 28 April 2016, as, contrary to the Tribunal's directions of 1 April 2016, the Claimant did not use this opportunity to \"file simultaneous surrebuttal documents, if any, with brief explanations\", but instead provided additional comments on the relevance of *Tenaris and Talta* in reply to the Respondent's 21 April 2016 submission. Furthermore, the Tribunal decides to deny the Claimant's request not to admit Exh. RL-276,31 which the Respondent introduced with its submission of 21 April 2016. The introduction of such legal authority complied with the Tribunal's directions of 1 April 2016, which specifically invited the Parties to file rebuttal submissions \"with the possibility of filing relevant additional exhibits and legal authorities\".32 In this context, it appears irrelevant that at an earlier stage of the proceedings (namely days before the May 2015 Hearing) the Tribunal had rejected the introduction of this legal authority, as that ruling only found that *at that time* the circumstances for inclusion were not met.33\n\nSee Respondent's letters of 29 April and 3 May 2016; Claimant's letter of 30 April 2016; Tribunal's letter of 13 May 2016.\n\nSee Claimant's Sur-Rebuttal to Respondent's 21 April 2016 Submission, dated 28 April 2016, para. 3 (\"[i]t would be procedurally unfair and prejudicial to Claimant to admit this same dictionary at this late stage\"); Claimant's letter, 30 April 2016, p. 2 (\"[i]it would be procedurally unfair and prejudicial to Claimant to admit this same evidence at this late stage\").\n\nTribunal's letter, 1 April 2016.\n\nSee Tribunal's letter, 20 May 2015.\n\n139.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal denies the Respondent's request to exclude from the record the Claimant's Legal Authority CLA-226,34 resubmitted with the Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief. Indeed, the Claimant did not submit a new legal authority in violation of the Tribunal's directions, but simply submitted additional portions of a book, excerpts of which were already in the record.\n\nSee Respondent's letter, 25 November 2015.\n\n140.\n\nFinally, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal exclude Legal Authorities CLA-300 to CLA-306 which the Claimant submitted with its Submission on Costs dated 4 December 2015, arguing that these authorities were filed in violation of the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 10.35 The Claimant, for its part, argued that it had complied with the Tribunal's direction in Procedural Order No. 10, adding that \"the Tribunal may apply the maxim *jura no[v]it curia* (or *jura novit arbiter*) and rely on any applicable legal authorities it deems relevant to its analysis\".36 The Tribunal generally agrees with the Claimant,37 and in particular notes that its direction in Procedural Order No. 10 that \"[n]o supporting document shall be appended\" to the Parties' cost submissions clearly referred to substantiation of the amount of the Parties' costs, not to legal authorities concerning issues that neither Party had previously addressed. The Respondent's request is thus rejected.\n\nRespondent's letter, 10 December 2015\n\nClaimant's letter, 10 December 2015, p. 1.\n\nSee also, amongst many, *Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015, para. 295.\n\n**IV. FACTS RELEVANT TO JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY: THE STRUCTURE OF THE WEATHER GROUP, THE CLAIMANT'S ALLEGED INVESTMENT IN OTA AND THE WIND ACQUISITION**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe following paragraphs provide a summary of the Parties' positions on the origin of the Claimant's alleged investment in OTA, the structure of the Weather Group, and the acquisition of Wind Telecomunicazioni S.p.A. (\"Wind\"). Some of these facts are in dispute between the Parties and are relevant to a number of jurisdictional or admissibility objections, in particular the Respondent's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* (see *infra* section V.C) and the Respondent's jurisdiction and admissibility objections in relation to the Claimant's status of indirect shareholder, the OTH Arbitration and settlement, and the sale of the Claimant's investment (see *infra* section V.D). The following summary does not reflect any finding of fact.\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. OTMTI's acquisition of interest in OTA in August 2005**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nPrior to August 2005, 56.5% of OTH's shares were owned by three companies, April Holding (\"April\"), OS Holding (\"OS\"), and Cylo Investments Ltd. (\"Cylo\") (collectively, the \"Sawiris Entities\").38 OTH, in turn, owned 87.66% of OTA, including through its subsidiary Oratel International Inc. (\"Oratel\"). This pre-August 2005 ownership structure is shown in the following chart:39\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, para. 19.\n\nReproduced from Tolkien Second Expert Report, para. 19.\n\n143.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, OTMTI's acquisition of an interest in OTA occurred in August 2005 as follows:40\n\na. The Sawiris Entities sold 50% plus one share of OTH to Weather Capital, a subsidiary of Weather Investments, in exchange for \u20ac3.5 billion in cash and a receivable under a subordinated loan (\u20ac1.2 billion in cash and \u20ac2.3 billion in the form of a loan).41\n\nb. The Sawiris Entities used this amount of \u20ac3.5 billion to subscribe shares in Weather Investments during a share offering.42\n\nc. OTMTI (then named Weather II) paid \u20ac294 million in cash to subscribe shares in Weather Investments during the share offering. The Italian utility company Enel S.p.A. (\"Enel\") and twenty-two other companies and individuals paid an additional \u20ac510 million in cash to subscribe Weather Investments shares during this share offering.\n\nd. OTMTI then paid new OTMTI shares valued at \u20ac3.5 billion43 to the Sawiris Entities in consideration for their shares in Weather Investments.\n\ne. As a result of these transactions, the Claimant contends that, as of 11 August 2005, OTMTI had paid \u20ac3.5 billion in new shares and over \u20ac294 million in cash to purchase Weather Investments shares. Because one of Weather Investments' main assets was its indirect shareholding in OTA, OTMTI thus paid \u20ac3,794 billion in cash and shares to acquire its indirect interest in OTA.44\n\nSee esp. Tolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, with further details on this set of transactions.\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, para. 3. As part of the 1 August 2005 purchase agreements, the Sawiris Entities were required to use the proceeds from the sale to purchase the shares of Weather Capital's parent, Weather Investments, within 10 business days. Failure to use the proceeds to subscribe the shares of Weather Investments would render the sale null and void retroactively, and require the Sawiris Entities to return the funds to Weather Capital. See Tolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, para. 5.\n\nA first increase of capital of Weather Investments was decided on 5 August 2005 for a total of \u20ac2.3 billion. To subscribe this share capital increase, the Sawiris Entities assigned to Weather Investments their receivable from the loan which they extended to Weather Capital. A second increase of capital of Weather Investments was approved on 10 August 2005 for a total of \u20ac2 billion. The Sawiris Entities subscribed \u20ac1.2 billion of this capital increase in cash.\n\nOn 5 August 2005, OTMTI increased its capital in an amount of \u20ac2.3 billion. The Sawiris Entities purchased these shares through payment of the Weather Investments' shares that they had purchased earlier that day. See Tolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, para. 8. On 11 August 2005, OTMTI increased its capital by a further \u20ac1.2 billion. The Sawiris Entities subscribed this capital increase through a payment of the Weather Investments shares that they had subscribed the previous day. See Tolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, para. 12.\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 2, para. 13.\n\n144.\n\nOTMTI's post-August 2005 ownership in OTA is shown in the following chart:45\n\nReproduced from Tolkien Expert Second Report, para. 21.\n\n**2. OTMTI's acquisition of Wind**\n----------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nThe following paragraphs summarize the acquisition of Wind, a matter which Algeria has raised in the context of its objections. For the Claimant, the acquisition of Wind is separate from OTMTI's acquisition of interest in OTH and OTA,46 \"though both acquisitions occurred as part of one set of transactions\".47\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 52; Tolkien Second Expert Report, para. 25 (explaining that the two acquisitions occurred separately and were treated separately for financial and accounting purposes).\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, Appendix 3, para. 2. See also Rejoinder, para. 59 (\"Claimant always has acknowledged that it acquired its indirect controlling shareholding in OTA in the context of acquiring an indirect controlling shareholding in Wind Italy and that it used shares of OTH as collateral to acquire Wind Italy. Claimant, however, also treated these transactions separately for financial and accounting purposes, and in fact established organizational structures to separate OTH and its subsidiaries from Wind Italy and its subsidiaries, which ensured that \u2018risks that faced one pillar would not necessarily affect the other pillar.'\" Internal footnotes omitted).\n\n146.\n\nIn August 2005, Weather Investments' subsidiary, Wind Acquisition Finance S.p.A. (\"Wind Acquisition\"), purchased 62.75% of Wind from Enel Investment Holding BV (\"Enel Investment\") for \u20ac2,986 billion in cash. The funds for this purchase came from a loan secured by OTH's shares and future earnings (\u20ac1.2 billion), loans secured by Wind's shares and future earnings (\u20ac981 million), and a cash-based capital subscription of Weather Investments' shares (for the remainder).48\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, paras. 26-27.\n\n147.\n\nIn February 2006, Weather Investments acquired the remainder of Wind from Enel for \u20ac328 million in cash and \u20ac1,665 billion in shares of Weather I nvestments.49\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, para. 28.\n\n148.\n\nFollowing these transactions, the ownership of the Weather Group was structured as follows:50\n\nReproduced from Tolkien Second Expert Report, para. 28.\n\n149.\n\nFor the Claimant and its expert, acquiring a company through debt secured by the acquired company's assets is a method commonly used and referred to as a leveraged buyout (\"LBO\"). In this case, one third of the purchase price came from debt secured by the target asset itself, while the remainder came from debt secured by assets of the acquirer.51 Furthermore, in the Claimant's submission, there was nothing unusual about the use of loans collateralized by another asset - in this case, the shares of OTH - to acquire a new asset.52\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, para. 29.\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, para. 31.\n\n**3. OTMTI's further purchases of Weather Investments shares**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, between December 2006 and January 2007, after acquiring Wind, it further increased its ownership interest in OTA through purchases of additional shares in Weather Investments:\n\na. On 21 December 2006, OTMTI directly purchased 16.1% of Weather Investments from Enel for a consideration of \u20ac1.21 billion in cash and a loan (\u20ac248 million in cash53 and \u20ac962 million in the form of a loan guarantee), which loan was repaid with interest in June 2008;54\n\nb. In December 2006 and January 2007, OTMTI purchased an additional 0.62% of Weather Investments shares from 17 Middle Eastern minority shareholders for \u20ac44.47 million;55\n\nc. Wind Acquisition Holdings Finance S.p.A. (\"WAHF\"), a subsidiary of OTMTI and Weather Investments, purchased the remaining 10% of Weather Investments shares from Enel for \u20ac751 million in cash.56\n\nThe Claimant directed its subsidiaries, Weather Investments and WAHF, to pay Enel from a dividend payment of \u20ac281 million that Weather Investments owed to the Claimant. See Rejoinder, para. 62.\n\nRejoinder, para. 61; Tolkien Second Expert Report, paras. 38, 44.\n\nRejoinder, para. 64; Tolkien Second Expert Report, paras. 38, 44.\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, paras. 38, 44.\n\n151.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant alleges that it made regular payments from 2006 to 2010 directly to Weather Investments in an aggregate amount of approximately \u20ac2.48 million.57\n\nRejoinder, para. 241.\n\n**4. OTMTI's ownership of OTA in 2011**\n---------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nAfter 2007, OTMTI sold certain shares in Weather Investments.58 It asserts, however, that at all times prior to its 2011 exit sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, it held about 70% or more of Weather Investments share capital.59\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, para. 39.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 55; Rejoinder, para. 69; Tolkien Second Expert Report, para. 6.\n\n153.\n\nAs of the beginning of 2011, prior to the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, OTMTI's interest in OTA was structured as follows:60\n\nChart reproduced from Tolkien Second Expert Report, para. 7.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n154.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant asserts that OTMTI paid a total of \u20ac5.1 billion in cash and shares, *inter alia*, to acquire its indirect investment in OTA through the acquisition of shares in Weather Investments.61\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 47; Tolkien Second Expert Report, para. 44.b.\n\n155.\n\nBecause OTMTI controlled more than 50% of the shares at each link in the corporate chain between OTMTI and OTA, OTMTI controlled OTA.62 OTMTI's control of OTA is also evidenced by the fact that Mr. Sawiris was the Chairman of OTMTI's Board, was elected by OTMTI as Chair of the Board of Weather Investments, and maintained his positions as Chairman of OTA and Executive Chairman of OTH's Board after OTMTI's creation.63\n\nTolkien Second Expert Report, para. 44.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 58.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that OTMTI (then Weather II) was created within the context and for the sole purpose of the acquisition of Wind, which presents no link with Algeria.64 The Respondent contends that Mr. Sawiris decided to use the OTH shares in order to finance such acquisition. It is within such context that Weather II was created and thus became a very indirect shareholder in OTH and OTA.\n\nReply, para. 15 (\" *Weather II a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e pour les seuls besoins de l'op\u00e9ration d'acquisition de Wind, qui ne pr\u00e9sente aucun lien avec l'Alg\u00e9rie* \").\n\n157.\n\nThe Respondent relies on a number of decisions rendered by the English courts between 2009 and 2013 in connection with the litigation opposing Mr. Alessandro Benedetti, an Italian businessman, on the one hand, and Mr. Sawiris, April, OS and Cylo, on the other hand, concerning the amount of the compensation due to Mr. Benedetti in consideration for his role in the closing of the purchase of Wind.65 The Respondent relies in particular on the decision of the High Court of Justice of 15 June 2009, describing the genesis and the conditions of the acquisition of Wind.66 On the basis of this narrative, the Respondent argues that the creation of Weather II, as well as the use of OTH's shares to finance the acquisition of Wind, were envisaged at the last moment by Mr. Sawiris; and that Weather II became a very indirect shareholder in OTH (which owned directly and indirectly OTA) for the sole purposes of the Wind transaction, and not for the purpose of investing in Algeria.\n\nReply, para. 15.\n\nReply, para. 16, referring to the Decision of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) of London, 15 June 2009, [2009] EWHC 1330 (Ch), Exh. R-1105.\n\n**1. The genesis of the acquisition of Wind**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nUntil May 2005, Wind was owned 37.25% by Enel and 62.75% by Enel Investment. The Respondent argues that around 2002 Mr. Sawiris envisaged to acquire control over Wind by effecting an investment through Rain Investments S.p.A., a company created in Italy together with Mr. Benedetti.67 At the end of 2004, however, the idea of using that vehicle was abandoned because Messrs. Sawiris and Benedetti had difficulties finding other investors.68\n\nReply, paras. 20-24.\n\nReply, paras. 19, 25.\n\n159.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Mr. Sawiris then partnered with different financiers with a view to acquiring all of Wind's shares through the Luxembourg-incorporated Weather Investments S.A. (\"Weather I\").69 This second project was similarly abandoned in April 2005, when Mr. Sawiris' financial partners decided to withdraw.70 It is in this context, the Respondent contends, that Mr. Sawiris, who at that time did not wish and was not in the position to invest a substantial amount to purchase Wind, \"at the last moment\" decided to use OTH shares as collateral to finance the operation.71 As a consequence, a new acquisition structure was put in place, which entailed the incorporation of the Luxembourg company Weather II on 24 May 2005, i.e. just two days before the conclusion of the sale purchase agreement of Wind.72 The creation of Weather II was, for the Respondent, essentially linked to tax efficiency reasons.73 The incorporation of Weather II followed a few days after the incorporation of another vehicle, Weather Investments, which had been constituted on 20 May 2005.74\n\nReply, paras. 29-30.\n\nReply, para. 31.\n\nReply, paras. 19, 32-35.\n\nReply, paras. 36-40.\n\nReply, para. 41.\n\nReply, para. 42.\n\n160.\n\nOn 26 May 2005, Enel and its holding company Enel Investment, on the one hand, and Mr. Sawiris, Weather II, April, OS and Weather Investments, on the other, signed the purchase agreement of Wind.75\n\nReply, para. 44.\n\n161.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent considers that it cannot be disputed that the purpose of the creation of Weather II and the use of shares in OTH for the purposes of financing such transactions were to allow Mr. Sawiris to purchase Wind at the lowest price, and not to invest in Algeria.76\n\nReply, para. 45.\n\n**2. The acquisition of Wind**\n------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nAt the moment of the closing of the purchase, the Sawiris Entities held 56.4% of OTH.77 The Respondent alleges that pursuant to the share purchase agreement, the acquisition of Wind occurred in two steps. First, different vehicles (held directly and indirectly by Weather Investments) purchased 62.75% of the shares in Wind. At a second stage, the remaining 37.25% of the shares were purchased. Following such transactions, the Claimant then acquired further shares in Weather Investments to finalize the acquisition.\n\nReply, para. 48. See also *Organigramme des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s,* Exh. R-1111, p. 6.\n\n**a. First phase: the purchase of 62.75% of Wind on 11 August 2005**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nIn May 2005, Mr. Sawiris and Banca IMI agreed to use the OTH shares as security for a loan of \u20ac1.2 billion financing the acquisition.78 According to the Respondent, it is within this context and pursuant to the share purchase agreement of 26 May 2005, that Weather II became an indirect shareholder in OTH.79\n\nReply, paras. 38, 51.\n\nReply, para. 51.\n\n164.\n\nOn 1 August 2005, the Sawiris Entities sold 50% plus one share in OTH to Weather Capital (which was fully owned by Weather Investments) pursuant to two share purchase agreements providing that the purchase price (in the amount to \u20ac3.5 billion) was to be used by the Sawiris Entities to subscribe shares in Weather Investments.80\n\nReply, para. 52.\n\n165.\n\nWeather Investments then increased its capital twice: on 5 and 10 August 2005, the Sawiris Entities subscribed shares in Weather Investments in consideration of a contribution in cash of \u20ac1.2 billion and of a contribution in kind of a credit amounting to \u20ac2.3 billion due by Weather Capital.81\n\nReply, para. 53.\n\n166.\n\nFurther, in the context of the capital increase of Weather Investments of 10 August 2005, Weather II and Enel made cash contributions in Weather Investments, which for the Respondents were one of the conditions precedent to the two collateral loans granted by Banca IMI.82 In this connection, Weather II allegedly made its cash contribution of \u20ac294 million.\n\nReply, para. 54.\n\n167.\n\nAs part of the sequence of transactions, the Sawiris Entities sold their shares in Weather Investments to Weather II in consideration for new shares in Weather II (for a value of \u20ac3.5 billion, equal to the sales price of the OTH shares to Weather Capital). On 10 August 2005, Weather II could then give its 50% plus one share in Weather Investments as security for the two loans previously obtained by Weather Capital from Banca IMI.83\n\nReply, para. 56.\n\n168.\n\nTherefore, Algeria submits that the use of the OTH shares allowed Mr. Sawiris to purchase Wind and that Weather II became an indirect shareholder of OTH during this first phase of the transaction for the purposes of financing the Wind transaction.\n\nb. **Second phase: the purchase of 37.25% of Wind on 2 February 2006**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nIn February 2006, Weather Investments (through its subsidiary Wind Acquisition Finance S.p.A. (\"Wind Acquisition\" or \"WAF\")) acquired the remainder of Wind from Enel by paying \u20ac328 million in cash84 and \u20ac1,665 billion in form of its own shares.85\n\nWeather Investment's Italian subsidiary WAF acquired 6.26% of the shares in Wind from Enel. See Reply, para. 59.\n\nOn 8 February 2006, Weather Investments issued shares for \u20ac1,665 billion, which were fully subscribed by Enel using the remaining 30.98% of its interest in Wind. Weather Investments then sold the 30.98% of Wind that it had received from Enel to Wind Acquisition in exchange for a payment of \u20ac1,665 billion. Weather Investments' ownership in Wind was then moved down to its subsidiary, Wind Acquisition, which now owned 100% of Wind.\n\n170.\n\nFollowing the closing of the Wind acquisition, Weather II owned 71.1% of Weather Investments; Enel 26.1%; and other investors 2.8%. Weather Investments owned 100% of WAHF, which owned 100% of Wind Acquisition, which owned 100% of Wind.86\n\nSee *Organigramme des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s,* Exh. R-1111, p. 8.\n\n171.\n\nFinally, on 21 December 2006, Enel sold the entirety of its 26.1% shareholding in Weather Investments to WAHF and Weather II.87 Weather II then acquired further shares in Weather Investments (0.62%) from certain Middle Eastern investors, upon terms which the Claimant has allegedly refused to disclose.88\n\nReply, para. 63.\n\nReply, para. 64.\n\n172.\n\nThus, the Respondent concludes, Mr. Sawiris and his family acquired control of Wind \"with a minimum of cash whilst retaining a majority interest in the 50.1% stake in [OTH]\".89 According to the Respondent, Mr. Sawiris is alleged to have stated that he managed to acquire Wind \"for free\".90\n\nReply, para. 66, citing to Decision of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) of London, 15 June 2009, [2009] EWHC 1330 (Ch), Exh.

OBJECTIONS TO THE TRIBUNAL'S JURISDICTION AND TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIMS**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. OVERVIEW OF THE OBJECTIONS AND THE PARTIES' PRAYERS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent has put forward the following objections to jurisdiction and to the admissibility of the claims:\n\na. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae*, because the BIT requires an \"investor\" to have its \"real seat\" in one of the Contracting States and the Claimant's real seat is not in Luxembourg, but in Egypt.\n\nb. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, because the Claimant made no investment within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, Algeria's offer to arbitrate contained in the BIT was not addressed to the Claimant at the time of filing of the Request for Arbitration on 19 October 2012, as at that time the Claimant owned an indirect shareholding in OTA equivalent to zero.\n\nc. The Tribunal further lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, because the Claimant is (or was) an indirect shareholder in OTA which is \"too far removed\" (*trop \u00e9loign\u00e9*) from the investment in OTA.\n\nd. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or should declare the claims inadmissible because there is no dispute between the Claimant and Algeria within the meaning of Article 9 of the BIT. Moreover, the claims are inadmissible as a result of OTH's exercise of its right to bring arbitration proceedings against Algeria which deprived the Claimant of standing to pursue its claims against the Respondent. Furthermore, Mr. Sawiris used his group of companies to seek to maximize his chances of success by introducing several arbitration proceedings against the Respondent at different levels of the chain of companies, which is an additional ground for the inadmissibility of the claims under the doctrine of abuse of rights. Finally, the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction or declare the Claimant's claims inadmissible as a result of the Settlement Agreement which has resolved the disputes opposing OTA and OTH to Algeria.\n\ne. The claims are inadmissible as the Claimant transferred its right to bring arbitration proceedings against Algeria when it sold its investment to VimpelCom.\n\nf. The acts of the state-owned television provider ENTV are not attributable to Algeria and the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction over the claims in relation to those acts.\n\ng. Finally, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the \"purely contractual claims\" relating to the Investment Agreement, and the umbrella clause claims in relation to the Investment Agreement, the GSM Licence and the Investment Code are also inadmissible.\n\n174.\n\nIn its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent has summarized its prayers for relief as follows:\n\nLa R\u00e9publique Alg\u00e9rienne D\u00e9mocratique et Populaire demande respectueusement au Tribunal arbitral de :\n\n\u2022 SE D\u00c9CLARER incomp\u00e9tent pour trancher le diff\u00e9rend soumis par la Demanderesse ;\n\n\u2022 D\u00c9CLARER, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, les demandes de la Demanderesse irrecevables ;\n\n\u2022 REJETER, en cons\u00e9quence, l'ensemble des demandes de la Demanderesse;\n\n\u2022 CONDAMNER la Demanderesse au paiement de l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des frais encourus par la D\u00e9fenderesse dans le pr\u00e9sent arbitrage, en ce compris les frais et honoraires des Membres du Tribunal arbitral, des conseils de la D\u00e9fenderesse et de ses experts, ainsi que de toutes autres sommes expos\u00e9es par la D\u00e9fenderesse pour les besoins de sa d\u00e9fense.91\n\nR-PHB 2, p. 55.\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimant has replied to the Respondent's jurisdictional and admissibility objections with the following arguments:\n\na. The Claimant is a Luxembourgish investor within the meaning of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, because it was constituted in accordance with Luxembourg law and its *si\u00e8ge social* is and has always been in Luxembourg.\n\nb. The Claimant made numerous investments and reinvestments within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nc. The Respondent is bound by the consent to arbitrate given in the BIT which expressly extends to \"minority or indirect\" investors, and the Respondent's suggestion that jurisdiction over indirect shareholders should be denied based on an asserted \"cut-off point\" is ill-founded.\n\nd. A dispute has existed between the Parties at all times since the Claimant's notification on 16 April 2012. Furthermore, OTH's commencement of a separate arbitration against the Respondent is irrelevant to this Tribunal's jurisdiction and to the admissibility of the claims in this arbitration. The Respondent's assertion that the claims should be dismissed under the doctrine of abuse of rights thus lacks merit. Similarly, the settlement of the OTH Arbitration is also irrelevant to jurisdiction and admissibility in this arbitration.\n\ne. The Claimant never sold or waived its right to bring arbitration against the Respondent; in effect, it expressly retained that right in the Risk Sharing Agreement which it concluded with VimpelCom on 15 April 2011.\n\nf. The Respondent's objection concerning the attribution of ENTV's actions pertains to the merits of the dispute and not to jurisdiction or admissibility. The Tribunal should thus postpone this issue until the merits phase.\n\ng. Finally, each of the claims relating to the Investment Agreement is for a violation of a specific provision of the BIT and the umbrella clause claims in relation to the Investment Agreement, the GSM Licence, and the Investment Code are all admissible, as the Claimant is entitled to rely upon the MFN clause in Article 10 of the BIT to invoke more favorable standards of protection in other investment treaties concluded by Algeria.\n\n176.\n\nIn its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant has summarized its prayers for relief as follows:\n\n[...] Claimant requests that the Tribunal dismiss Respondent's preliminary objections in their entirety and order Respondent to bear all costs and expenses incurred by Claimant in defending against Respondent's meritless preliminary objections, including all legal fees and disbursements. Claimant also requests such further or other relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.92\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 121.\n\n177.\n\nAs is clear from the preceding paragraphs, the Respondent has raised many preliminary objections. Some of these objections address closely related issues, although they are presented from different viewpoints. For a better structure and legibility of its analysis, the Tribunal deems it convenient to review the Respondent's objections in four main groups. First, the Tribunal will examine whether the Claimant fulfils the requirements *ratione personae* under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, in particular whether it is an \"investor\" pursuant to Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT (B). Second, the Tribunal will analyze whether the Claimant has made an \"investment\" within the meaning of Articles 25 of the ICSID Convention and 1(2) of the BIT (C). Third, the Tribunal will deal with the objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and/or the admissibility of the claims in connection with the Claimant's alleged status of (former) \"very indirect\" shareholder of OTA and the inter-relationship with the claims put forward by OTH in different proceedings, including the settlement of these claims. This group of objections also covers the consequences of the sale of the Claimant's alleged investment, the alleged sale, loss or waiver of its right to bring arbitration proceedings and the defense of abuse of rights (D). While the Parties have \"dissected\" each of these issues (and additional related subissues) in separate objections, the Tribunal considers that it is convenient to treat all of these issues within the same context as they are intertwined. Fourth and last, the Tribunal will deal with a number of miscellaneous objections, namely whether the acts of the state-owned television provider ENTV are attributable to Algeria (E), whether the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the \"purely contractual claims\" relating to the Investment Agreement (F), and whether the umbrella clause claims in relation to the Investment Agreement, the GSM License and the Investment Code are admissible (G).\n\n**B. JURISDICTION** ***RATIONE PERSONAE*****: IS THE CLAIMANT AN INVESTOR UNDER ARTICLE 1(1)(B) OF THEBIT?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the BIT requires an \"investor\" to have its \"real seat\" in one of the Contracting States (a) and that the Claimant is not an investor under the BIT because its real seat is not in Luxembourg, but in Egypt (b). The Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae*.93\n\nIn its Memorial on Preliminary Objections and in its Reply, the Respondent also argued that, even if the Tribunal were to find that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae*, the Claimant's claims are inadmissible, because the Claimant was not an investor at the time of the impugned acts (*faits litigieux*). See Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 274-282; Reply, paras. 395-407. This admissibility objection rests on the same facts as the Respondent's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae*, although there is a different temporal element (with regard to the jurisdictional objection the Respondent contends that \" *cette qualit\u00e9 [d'investisseur] s'appr\u00e9cie au jour du depot de la Demande d'arbitrage* \", Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 106). The admissibility \"facet\" of this objection was not further pursued in the Respondent's post-hearing submissions. The Claimant has not expressly addressed the Respondent's objection to admissibility, but it argues that the Claimant \"has always had\" its seat in Luxembourg and that it \"is and it has always been\" an investor under the BIT.\n\na. **To qualify as an investor under the BIT, the Claimant must have its real seat in Luxembourg**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT requires an \"investor\" to have its \"real seat\" in one of the Contracting States, which must be understood to mean \"place of effective management\" (*centre de direction effective*).94\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 109-134; R-PHB 1, paras. 19-49; R-PHB 2, paras. 12-47.\n\n**i. To qualify as an investor under the BIT, the Claimant must fulfil the twoseparate and cumulative conditions of incorporation and si\u00e8ge soci*****al***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the absence of a definition of nationality of legal persons in the ICSID Convention leaves it to the Contracting States to define the criteria that determine such nationality under their investment treaties.95 In this sense, it refers to Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, which reads as follows:\n\nPour l'application du pr\u00e9sent Accord,\n\n1. le terme \u00ab investisseurs \u00bb d\u00e9signe :\n\na) les \u00ab nationaux \u00bb, c'est-\u00e0-dire, toute personne physique qui, selon la l\u00e9gislation des Etats contractants, est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme citoyen de la Belgique, du Luxembourg ou ayant la nationalit\u00e9 alg\u00e9rienne;\n\nb) Les \u00ab soci\u00e9t\u00e9s \u00bb, c'est-\u00e0-dire, toute personne morale constitu\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation belge, luxembourgeoise ou alg\u00e9rienne, et ayant son si\u00e8ge social sur le territoire de la Belgique, du Luxembourg ou de l'Alg\u00e9rie.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 23; Reply, para. 159.\n\n181.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, to qualify as an investor under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, the Claimant must meet the following cumulative and distinct requirements: (a) it must be incorporated in accordance with the laws of one of the Contracting Parties and (b) its *si\u00e8ge social* must be located in the territory of that party.96 For the Respondent, \"simply incorporating a company in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties is not sufficient to meet the two nationality conditions provided in the BIT\".97\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 112-121; R-PHB 1, paras. 22-31.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 30.\n\n182.\n\nFor the Respondent, this interpretation flows from the text of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, whose meaning is identical in the three official languages (French, Dutch and Arabic).98 In particular, the Respondent contends that the Dutch and Arabic terms are the literal translation of the term \" *si\u00e8ge social* \". By contrast, the term \"statutory seat\" (\" *si\u00e8ge statutaire* \") does not appear in any of the three authentic versions of the Treaty.99\n\nSee Letter from the Respondent, 11 March 2016, pp. 2-3.\n\nLetter from the Respondent, 11 March 2016, p. 3.\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, in accordance with the principle of effectiveness, the criteria of incorporation and *si\u00e8ge social* cannot have the same meaning.100 Because incorporation in one of the Contracting Parties entails a registered office (*si\u00e8ge statutaire*) on the territory of such Contracting Party, any interpretation that would attribute the same meaning to incorporation and *si\u00e8ge social* must be discarded.101\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 121-122; R-PHB 1, paras. 26-28.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 28.\n\n184.\n\nFor the Respondent, it is undisputed that a company must have its statutory seat in a Contracting Party to be validly incorporated in that Contracting Party. The hypothetical presented by the Claimant in order to differentiate incorporation and statutory seat, i.e. the possibility of a transfer of the statutory seat abroad, is not pertinent to interpret the BIT which was concluded in 1991, as such possibility did not exist in 1991 and is \"very rare\" nowadays.102\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 27; R-PHB 2, fn. 42.\n\n**ii. The Claimant's nationality under the BIT must be determined by reference to the domestic laws of the Contracting Parties, which point to the \"real seat\"**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent's position on the applicable law to determine the meaning of *si\u00e8ge social* has somewhat evolved throughout its pleadings. In its Reply, the Respondent argued that the Claimant's status as an investor under the BIT should not be based \"on the principles of Luxembourg law relating to nationality\" but rather on the meaning of *si\u00e8ge social* under \"principles of applicable international law\".103 In its post-hearing submissions, however, the Respondent now submits that, in accordance with international law, the nationality of a company under Article 1(1)(b) is determined by reference to the domestic laws of the Contracting Parties, which adopt the notion of \" *si\u00e8ge social r\u00e9el* \" as the connecting factor for purposes of nationality.104\n\nSee Reply, paras. 156, 159-160 (\" *Conform\u00e9ment aux principes de droit international applicables, la notion du \u2018si\u00e8ge social' au sens de l'article 1(1)(b) de l'Accord s'entend du \u2018si\u00e8ge social r\u00e9el' de la personne morale\"; \"Contrairement \u00e0 la Demanderesse qui se fonde sur les principes de droit luxembourgeois relatifs \u00e0 la nationalit\u00e9, la D\u00e9fenderesse soutient que l'absence de d\u00e9finition de la nationalit\u00e9 d'une personne morale dans la Convention CIRDI laisse le soin aux Etats contractants de d\u00e9finir, dans des accords de protection des investissements, les* *crit\u00e8res permettant de d\u00e9terminer la nationalit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne morale au sens desdits accords \"Il convient* *donc de se reporter aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 1(1)(b) de l'Accord afin de d\u00e9terminer si Weather II est un investisseur prot\u00e9g\u00e9 au sens dudit Accord* \").

With regard to nationality, international law leaves it to each state to decide to which entities it confers the status of subject of national law (*sujet de droit interne*).105 For the Respondent, the *travaux* produced by Belgium confirm that the Contracting Parties intended that *si\u00e8ge social* be defined by national law.106 The Tribunal must thus rely on the connecting factors of nationality provided in the domestic laws of the Contracting Parties.107 According to the Respondent, while common law countries refer to \"incorporation\" as the relevant criterion for nationality, civil law countries, such as the Contracting States to the BIT, require a real connection (*rattachement r\u00e9el*), i.e. the effective presence of the corporation on the territory.108\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 32; R-PHB 2, para. 21.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 23.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 22.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 34. See also Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 118; Reply, para. 171.\n\n187.\n\nIn any event, even if the Tribunal were minded to interpret the term *si\u00e8ge social* in an autonomous manner as a \"requirement for nationality under the BIT\", it would reach the same outcome.109\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 37; R-PHB 2, para. 26.\n\n188.\n\nWith regard to the Claimant's arguments on the ordinary meaning of the BIT term, the Respondent first contends that dictionaries \"are of no use\", because \"there is no international law dictionary with a definition of *si\u00e8ge social* \".110 Second, the fact that the authentic English version of other BITs signed by the BLEU translates *si\u00e8ge social* as \"registered office\" is irrelevant to establish the Contracting Parties' common intention in this BIT, as English is not an authentic language for this BIT. Furthermore, the Respondent submits that \"[a]n analysis of the investment protection agreements signed by the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union fails to reveal an \u2018ordinary meaning' of the concept of \u2018 *si\u00e8ge social* '\", and \"confirms conversely that there is no practice about how to translate the concept of \u2018 *si\u00e8ge social* '\".111 For the Respondent, at the time of the negotiation of the BIT, there was no Belgo-Luxembourg practice to use the terms *si\u00e8ge social* and registered office interchangeably or to insert the criterion of *si\u00e8ge statutaire* in the definition of investor.112 To the contrary, the \"traditional formula\" alluded to in the Explanatory Note submitted by the Belgian Government to the Belgian Senate on 8 November 1995 for purposes of ratifying the BIT must be seen as a reference to nationality in accordance with Belgian and Luxembourgish law.113\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 38; R-PHB 2, para. 27.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 39.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 27.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 27.\n\n189.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that \"in the absence of an unequivocal ordinary meaning of the concept of *si\u00e8ge social* in international law, reference to the national laws of the Contracting Parties is justified in light of the principles stipulated in [Article 32 of] the Vienna Convention\".114 In this case, all three Contracting Parties provide that the connecting factor to determine nationality of companies under their domestic laws is the *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el*.115 This was true when the BIT was signed in 1991 and continues to be true now.116 In this respect, so the Respondent notes, the fact that Luxembourg law in other contexts sometimes uses the term *si\u00e8ge social* to designate the company's *si\u00e8ge statutaire* lacks relevance when interpreting the concept of *si\u00e8ge social* as a connecting factor to determine nationality.117\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 40.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 125-127; R-PHB 1, para. 42; R-PHB 2, para. 29.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 29.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 42; R-PHB 2, para. 30.\n\n190.\n\nFurthermore, investment tribunals dealing with similar definitions of investor have also ruled that mere incorporation in a state is insufficient to establish the existence of a social seat. The Respondent cites *Alps Finance and Trade v. Slovakia*, where the tribunal noted that \"[t]he fact that Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT requires a Swiss \u2018seat' as a distinct element in addition to \u2018constitution and organization under Swiss law' demonstrates that the mere incorporation in Switzerland is insufficient to constitute a \u2018seat' in the terms of the BIT\".118\n\nReply, para. 181 discussing *Alps Finance and Trade v. Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award, 5 March 2011, Exh. CLA-4.\n\n**iii. The** ***travaux*** **produced by Belgium confirm the Respondent's interpretation**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nFor the Respondent, the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* produced by Belgium confirm the Respondent's arguments. The Respondent notes that Algeria sought to exclude from the BIT's scope of application individuals or companies of a Contracting Party who did not have their principal center of economic activities (*centre principal des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9conomiques*) in Belgium or Luxembourg.119 Algeria thus proposed the addition of such economic criterion which was independent from nationality, and was defined by reference to the investor's average turnover (*chiffre d\u2018affaires moyen des investisseurs*). However, following exchanges between the Contracting Parties, the Algerian negotiators did not insist on their proposal.120\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 35.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 37.\n\n192.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimant's argument that the criterion of *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* was rejected during the BIT negotiations is ill-founded.121 The Contracting Parties subjected the notion of investor, *inter alia*, to a nationality test consisting of the presence of the *si\u00e8ge social* on their territory by reference to their national legislation. Thus, it is clear that the Contracting Parties intended to provide for the \"real seat\" as it is known in their domestic laws.122\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 38.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 38.\n\n193.\n\nFinally, in connection with disclosure of the *travaux,* the Respondent opposes the Claimant's criticism by pointing to the numerous attempts made by the Respondent to retrieve such *travaux* during the proceedings.123 In any event, the Claimant's request that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences against the Respondent has become moot after the production of the *travaux* by Belgium.124\n\nR-PHB 2, paras. 15-17.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 14.\n\n**iv. \"Real seat\" means the company's place of effective management**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the notion of *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* in civil law countries, including the BIT Contracting Parties, corresponds to the center of effective management of the company. It refers to Jean Corbiau's definition of the \"heart and the brain\" of the corporation, which in the Respondent's view is still valid today and conforms to recent Luxembourgish case law.125\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 44-45; R-PHB 2, paras. 39-40. See also Memorial, paras. 128-134.\n\n195.\n\nTo identify the real seat, it is necessary to verify the reality or effectiveness of the seat over the appearance created by the statutory seat.126 For the Respondent, the presumption that the real seat is identified with the statutory seat is a simple presumption (*pr\u00e9somption simple*) which can be rebutted by any means.127 The main test to localize the *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* is the place where the company's important business decisions are taken (*lieu o\u00f9 sont prises les d\u00e9cisions importantes se rapportant \u00e0 la marche de l\u2019entreprise*).128 While the Respondent agrees with the Claimant that the factors to be considered include the place where the meetings of the corporate organs are held, where the administrative services are provided, where the accounting is held, and to which correspondence is addressed or from which it is sent, the Respondent submits that one must take account of the effectivity of these factors.129 Thus, the place where the corporate meetings take place is relevant, but it is necessary to verify how those meetings take place.130 Similarly, it does not matter where the accounting records are maintained, but where the accounting is effectively carried out.131\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 46; R-PHB 2, para. 41. See also Reply, para. 172 (\"in Algeria, Belgium and Luxembourg, national laws and practice enshrine the primacy of the *si\u00e8ge social r\u00e9el* as an element of attachment and, in the event of an inconsistency between the *si\u00e8ge statutaire* and the *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el*, the latter will prevail\").\n\nReply, para. 193; R-PHB, para. 46; R-PHB 2, para. 41.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 47.\n\nR-PHB 2, paras. 42-43.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 43.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 43.\n\n196.\n\nFinally, the certificates of residence issued by Luxembourg on which the Claimant relies are irrelevant, as such certificates are issued to any company having its statutory seat in Luxembourg.132 In the absence of any official document attesting the Luxembourgish nationality of the Claimant, it is for the Tribunal to assess the totality of the factual elements, to decide whether the Claimant's real seat, namely its place of effective management, is situated in Luxembourg.133\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 46.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 47.\n\n**v.** ***Tenaris and Talta*** **confirms the Respondent's interpretation of si\u00e8ge social**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's invitation to the Parties to submit comments on the award issued on 29 January 2016 in *Tenaris and Talta*, the Respondent contends that such award confirms its interpretation of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.134\n\nLetter from Respondent, 11 March 2016, pp. 4-12.\n\n198.\n\nFirst, in the context of a similarly worded provision, the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal interpreted *si\u00e8ge social* to mean *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el*. For the Respondent, the tribunal's conclusion is based on a reasoning and interpretation method similar to those advanced by Algeria in these proceedings. The Respondent points in particular to the tribunal's resort to the principle of effectiveness135 and its conclusion that the conditions in Article 1(1)(b) of the applicable BIT \"are, in substance, nationality requirements\" which, in the Respondent's view, justifies referring to the applicable domestic law.136\n\nLetter from Respondent, 11 March 2016, p. 5; Letter from Respondent, 21 April 2016, pp. 3-4.\n\nLetter from Respondent, 11 March 2016, p. 6; Letter from Respondent, 21 April 2016, p. 5.\n\n199.\n\nSecond, the Respondent highlights that, in determining whether Tenaris had its real seat in Luxembourg, the tribunal proceeded to analyse *in concreto* the facts of the case, taking into account all available factual elements and the particular circumstances of the case.137 The Respondent contends that, contrary to Venezuela in *Tenaris and Talta*, it has established that the Claimant's real seat is located in Egypt.138\n\nLetter from Respondent, 11 March 2016, p. 7.\n\nLetter from Respondent, 11 March 2016, pp. 8-12; Letter from Respondent, 21 April 2016, pp. 11-16.\n\n**b. The Claimant's real seat is in Egypt**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nAlgeria argues that the Claimant's real seat is in Egypt. In particular, the Respondent argues that the brain and the operational bodies of the Claimant are located in Cairo, from where Mr. Sawiris and his team effectively manage the company (i). Furthermore, the Board of Managers is not the true management organ of the company, and the fact that its meetings are formally held in Luxembourg does not establish that the Claimant's real seat is located there (ii).\n\n**i. The Claimant's effective management is in Cairo**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant's brain and the operational bodies are located in Cairo, from where Mr. Sawiris manages the company with the help of his team.139 Mr. Sawiris takes all the strategic decisions from his headquarters in Cairo and is the \"intellectual center around which all operations and activities of the company are organized\".140\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 51; R-PHB 2, para. 49.\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 51-54.\n\n202.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Sawiris' entire team is located in Cairo.141 The Respondent notes that Ms. Wafaa Latif, an A Manager of the company, assists Mr. Sawiris from Cairo in the management of the business.142 Moreover, most of the individuals involved in the negotiation and closing of the Claimant's transactions (in particular the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom) are close employees of Mr. Sawiris residing in Cairo.143 Furthermore, the Respondent asserts that the company's accountants work in Cairo, as is proven by the Banca IMI statements addressed to the \"Corporate Accounting Department\" of the Claimant in Cairo.144\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 56.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 51.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 51.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 56.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that \"the majority of the contracts signed by Weather II and the bank statements [...] between 2005 and 2007 indicated that the domicile of Weather II was the professional address of Mr. Naguib Sawiris in Cairo\".145 Moreover, the majority of the contracts concluded by the Claimant between 2005 and 2012 provide for notices to be sent by post or fax to Cairo.146\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 57.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 57; R-PHB 2, para. 56.\n\n204.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimant has attempted to increase its presence in Luxembourg for the needs of the arbitration. In particular, the Respondent notes that the Claimant filed its consolidated accounts for the years 2009-2011 for the first time in September 2012, i.e. three weeks before it filed its Request for Arbitration, and the accounts unlike its previous annual reports mention OTA. Furthermore, the Claimant set up a website (whose servers are located in Egypt) on 15 May 2013, the day before the Tribunal's First Session, where the only thing that appeared was the Claimant's logo.147\n\nReply, paras. 118-120; R-PHB 1, para. 9.\n\n**ii. The Board of Managers is not the true management organ of the Claimant**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Board of Managers is not the true management organ of the Claimant and does not fulfil the function assigned to it by the Articles of Association. As a result, the fact that its meetings are formally held in Luxembourg cannot be taken as an indication that the Claimant's real seat is in Luxembourg.148\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 59-79; R-PHB 2, paras. 58-60.\n\n206.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that the Board of Managers only ratifies decisions taken by Mr. Sawiris from Cairo.149 Specifically, the B Managers have no decision-making power nor room to maneuver when approving resolutions.150 Further, in light of the number of corporate positions held by each B Manager it is impossible for him or her to actually monitor the business of each company and to make enlightened decisions in respect of the resolutions submitted to the Board of Directors.151 The Claimant's B Managers are not informed of the business of the company that they are supposed to be managing, because they do not participate in negotiating or concluding contracts of the company.152\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 62-70.\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 61, 63; R-PHB 2, para. 58.\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 67-68; R-PHB 2, para. 58.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 65.\n\n207.\n\nConsequently, the Respondent observes that the Board of Managers does not fulfil its role as the body entrusted with the management of the company under the Claimant's Articles of Association.153 For the Respondent, the requirement of exclusive and effective management of the company from Luxembourg, which is foreseen by the Articles of Association, is thus manifestly not respected.154 The Board of Managers' role is rather limited to performing administrative tasks.155 There is further no element showing that the place of effective management is located in Luxembourg.156\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 59.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 76.\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 77-78.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 59.\n\n208.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione personae,* because the conditions of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT are not fulfilled.157 Indeed, they require that the investor's *si\u00e8ge social r\u00e9el* be in Luxembourg while the Claimant's place of effective management is in Cairo.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 79.\n\n**2. The Claimant** ' **s position**\n------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* because the Claimant is a national under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and a protected investor under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT.\n\n210.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant contends that it was constituted in Luxembourg in accordance with Luxembourg law and that its registered office is and always has been in Luxembourg. The Claimant thus is an investor under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, because the ordinary meaning of \" *si\u00e8ge social* \" in the BIT is \"registered office\" (a). In the Claimant's view, the BIT's *travaux*, which were produced by Belgium, confirm this interpretation. In any event, even assuming that \" *si\u00e8ge social* \" means \"place of effective management\", the Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to meet its high burden of proving that the Claimant's place of effective management is in Egypt, the evidence confirming that such place is situated in Luxembourg (b).\n\na. ***\"Si\u00e8ge social\"*** **means \"registered office\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. The BIT's definition of \"investor\" is independent of and not modified by domestic nationality requirements**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe Claimant's position has somewhat evolved throughout its pleadings. Initially, the Claimant argued that Luxembourg law applies to the determination of the Claimant's nationality.158 Starting from its Rejoinder and especially in its post-hearing submissions, the Claimant now submits that the BIT's definition of \"investor\" is independent of and not modified by domestic nationality requirements.159\n\nSee especially Counter-Memorial, para. 13 (where the Claimant submits that: \"[i]t is a well-established principle of international law that nationality is governed by the domestic law of the State which determines who will be a national of that State for purposes of the BIT. Algeria confirms this principle. Algeria also agrees that it is a State's laws which determine whether a company has met the requirements of *si\u00e8ge social*. Thus, the law applicable to the question of whether OTMTI had its *si\u00e8ge social* in Luxembourg is the law of Luxembourg\").\n\nC-PHB 1, paras. 10-14; C-PHB 2, paras. 3-7.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimant argues that under Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention, state parties enjoy wide latitude to agree on the criteria by which nationality (including corporate nationality) is determined.160 It refers to Article 1(1) of the BIT which was quoted in its original French version above (at paragraph 180) and in its unofficial English translation submitted by Belgium to the United Nations Treaty Series provides as follows:\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement,\n\n1. The term \"investors\" shall mean:\n\n(a) \"Nationals\", i.e. any natural person who, under the legislation of the Contracting States, is deemed a citizen of Belgium or Luxembourg or who has Algerian nationality;\n\n(b) \"Companies\", i.e. any legal person constituted in accordance with Belgian, Luxembourg or Algerian legislation and having its registered office in the territory of Belgium, Luxembourg or Algeria.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 140-142; C-PHB 1, para. 10.\n\n213.\n\nOn this basis, the Claimant contends that the BIT defines investor companies in clear terms, without referring to domestic nationality requirements. Indeed, while Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT defines \"nationals\" as \"any natural person who, *under the legislation of the Contracting States*, is deemed a citizen of Belgium or Luxembourg or who has Algerian nationality\",161 there is no reference to nationality under domestic law when it comes to \"companies\".162 Thus, so the Claimant argues, the BIT's definition of investor is independent of domestic nationality requirements.163\n\nBIT, Article 1(1)(a) (emphasis added).\n\nRejoinder, para. 168; C-PHB 1, para. 13.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 13; C-PHB 2, para. 3. The Claimant further submits that \"this definition of nationality in the BIT takes precedence in assessing Claimant's nationality and status as an \"investor\" for purposes of jurisdiction over any provision of domestic law of the three Contracting Parties concerning the nationality of juridical entities. This approach accords, moreover, with the domestic law of Claimant's home State, Luxembourg, which provides that international treaties have binding force within Luxembourg and supersede national laws\" (Rejoinder, para. 143, internal footnotes omitted).\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimant notes that, in *Barcelona Traction,* the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") observed that \"whenever legal issues arise concerning the rights of States with regard to the treatment of companies and shareholders, as to which rights international law has not established its own rules, it has to refer to the relevant rules of municipal law\".164 In this case, the BIT has \"established its own rules\" and there is therefore no basis to consider national law. Moreover, in *Barcelona Traction*, the Court was establishing nationality for the purposes of diplomatic protection, which is a different issue from the one at stake here.165\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 6, referring to *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co., Ltd* (Belgium v. Spain), Judgment, 1970 ICJ Rep. 3, 5 February 1970, Exh. CLA-145, para. 38 [hereinafter *Barcelona Traction* ].\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 6.\n\n**ii. The ordinary meaning of the term** ***si\u00e8ge social*** **in the BIT is \"registered office\"**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThe Claimant stresses that the BIT definition must be interpreted in accordance with the VCLT, which requires a treaty's terms to be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose\". In this respect, the Claimant submits that the party invoking a special meaning has the burden of proving it; that the ordinary meaning may not be disregarded based on the object and purpose of the treaty; and that supplementary means of interpretation (such as the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*) may only be relied upon to clarify a treaty provision that is ambiguous or obscure or the ordinary meaning of which leads to a manifestly absurd or unreasonable result.166 Investment tribunals confirm this understanding.167\n\nRejoinder, paras. 146-150.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 149-150, discussing *Asian Agricultural Products LTD.

The Claimant cites the following dictionaries: Le Petit Robert, Dalloz, Collins, Harrap's, Navarre.\n\nC-PHB 1, paras. 17-18; C-PHB 2, para. 8.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 19.\n\n218.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal's questions on the meaning of the term *siege social* in the other two authentic language versions of the BIT,171 the Claimant submits that the authentic Dutch and Arabic versions of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT confirm that *siege social* means registered office.172\n\nSee para. 122 above.\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, 11 March 2016 (\"Claimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions\"), paras. 76-90.\n\n219.\n\nFirst, according to the Claimant, the term *\"maatschappelijke zetel* \" which appears in the authentic Dutch version of the BIT, is commonly translated as \" *siege social* \" in Dutch-French dictionaries. The Claimant refers to a number of dictionaries that define the term as the place where the company is located and which is indicated in its articles of association.173 The Claimant also argues that the Dutch term \" *maatschappelijke zetel* \" is also consistently used in the Belgium Company Code in contexts that clearly mean \"registered office\".174 Furthermore, in the Belgium Tax and Revenues Code and the Belgium Judicial Code, the terms \" *maatschappelijke zetel* \" and \" *siege social\"* are used to mean \"registered office\" and are distinguished from other terms (such as \" *principal etablissement* \", \" *siege de direction* \", \" *siege d'administration* \" and \" *siege administratif* \") that correspond to the seat of management or real seat.175\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, paras. 77-80.\n\nSee Claimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, paras. 81-82, discussing Belgium Company Code, Exh.

However, it submits that the more commonly used terms in Arabic, \" *markaz al shareka al raesee* \" or \" *markaz al shareka* \" have the same meaning as \" *maqaraho al ijtimaee* \" (which is found in the BIT).177\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, paras. 84-90.\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, para. 87.\n\n221.\n\nFurthermore, for the Claimant, supplementary means of interpretation confirm that the ordinary meaning of *si\u00e8ge social* is registered office. In particular, the Claimant submits that although the BIT was concluded in French, Dutch, and Arabic, Belgium deposited an unofficial English translation of the BIT with the United Nations Treaty Series, which uses registered office for *si\u00e8ge social*.178 Furthermore, the BLEU's Model BIT provides in English that \"[t]he term \u2018investors' shall mean. the \u2018companies', i.e. any legal person constituted in accordance with the legislation of the Kingdom of Belgium, of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg or of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and having its registered office in the territory of the Kingdom of Belgium, of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg or of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_respectively\".179\n\nRejoinder, para. 159; C-PHB 1, para. 21; C-PHB 2, para. 8.\n\nRejoinder, para. 161; C-PHB 1, para. 23, referring to Model Agreement Between the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union, on the One Hand, and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, on the Other Hand, on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, 2002, Exh. C-982, Article 1(1)(b).\n\n222.\n\nFurthermore, numerous other BITs demonstrate that *si\u00e8ge social* means registered office. The Claimant refers to the BLEU BIT practice and notes that from 1984 to 2009, the BLEU has concluded at least 26 treaties that define investors by referring to \"registered office\" in the authentic English text and \" *si\u00e8ge social* \" in the authentic French text.180 Furthermore, the BLEU-Costa Rica BIT likewise uses \" *si\u00e8ge social* \" in the authentic French text and \" *domicilio registral* \", which means \"registered domicile\", in the authentic Spanish text.181 Moreover, the BLEU-United Arab Emirates and the BLEU-Libya BITs demonstrate that *si\u00e8ge social* means registered office and not \"place of management\" or \"residence\", which are referred to as \" *si\u00e8ge de direction* \" and \" *domicile* \" in the authentic French versions of those BITs.182 And where the BLEU sought to impose additional requirements for purposes of defining investors under its treaties, it did so explicitly through terms that do not appear in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT with Algeria.183 Finally, the Claimant points to the 1991 double taxation treaty between Belgium and Algeria, which defines \"resident of a Contracting State\" by referring to the \"place of management\" (*si\u00e8ge de direction*), rather than *si\u00e8ge social*.184 The Claimant concludes on this point by stressing that the Respondent has failed to submit any treaty entered into by either Contracting Party that translates *si\u00e8ge social* as place of management or any other term that the Respondent seeks to read into the BIT to define *si\u00e8ge social*.185\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 15; Rejoinder, paras. 160-161; C-PHB 1, para. 23; C-PHB 2, para. 8.\n\nRejoinder, para. 161; C-PHB 1, para. 23, referring to Agreement between the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union and the Republic of Costa Rica on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, Exh.

For the Claimant and its experts, the term \" *si\u00e8ge social* \" or \" *si\u00e8ge* \" under Luxembourg law refer to a company's statutory seat.187 Indeed, Luxembourg law consistently uses the term *si\u00e8ge social* to refer to the seat indicated in the articles of association.188 By contrast, when Luxembourg intends to mean the real seat it uses different terms, such as \" *domicile* \", \" *administration centrale* \", or \" *si\u00e8ge d\u2019op\u00e9ration* \".189\n\nSchmitt First Expert Report, para. 11; Pr\u00fcm First Expert Report, paras. 10-14; Pr\u00fcm Second Expert Report, para. 8.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 28.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 29, discussing in particular Article 27(3) of the Luxembourg Company Law which requires a company to list its *si\u00e8ge social* in its articles of association.\n\nRejoinder, para. 154.\n\n224.\n\nFurthermore, so says the Claimant, the Respondent's argument that the BIT's terms need to be understood at the time of its conclusion in 1991 (at which time, according to the Respondent, the term meant place of effective management under Luxembourg law) is incorrect. First, pointing to ICJ case law, the Claimant submits that the meaning of a term should not be confined to the meaning given at the time of the creation of the relevant instrument, and that the meaning of general terms in a treaty with continuing duration should be understood to evolve over time.190 Second, even assuming *arguendo* that the term *si\u00e8ge social* should be interpreted at the time of the BIT's conclusion in 1991, the Claimant and its expert, Prof. Pr\u00fcm, consider that *si\u00e8ge social* has always meant the \"statutory seat\" as a matter of Luxembourg law.191\n\nRejoinder, paras. 164-165; C-PHB 1, para. 31.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 31.\n\n225.\n\nFinally, arbitral practice confirms that *si\u00e8ge social* means registered office.192 The Claimant points to ICSID case law as well as to *Barcelona Traction*, where in the Claimant's view the ICJ used the terms *si\u00e8ge social* and registered office interchangeably and distinguished the concept of *si\u00e8ge social* from place of management and center of control.193 For the Claimant, *Alps v. Slovak Republic*, on which the Respondent relies, is inapposite because it does not refer to *si\u00e8ge social* and the BIT applicable in that case defined investors differently, i.e. as companies \"which are constituted or otherwise duly organized under the laws of that Contracting Party, and have their seat, together with real economic activities, in the territory of that same Contracting Party\".194\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 16; Rejoinder, paras. 171-176.\n\nRejoinder, para. 175; C-PHB, para. 34, discussing *Barcelona Traction*.\n\nRejoinder, para. 176; C-PHB 1, para. 35, discussing *Alps Finance and Trade v.

The Claimant notes that the Respondent sought to excuse this failure on the ground that \"[t]he Agreement [BIT] was signed in 1991, 20 years ago and [\u2026] months before the beginning of a conflict that plunged the country into a civil war until the end of the 1990s\".

See also C-PHB 1, para. 38.\n\n227.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that the ordinary meaning of *si\u00e8ge social* is neither obscure nor ambiguous and would not lead to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.196 However, in accordance with Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, the Tribunal may rely on the *travaux* \"to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31\".197\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 37; C-PHB 2, para. 7.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 15.\n\n228.\n\nIn this respect, the Claimant asserts that the *travaux* produced by Belgium show that the Contracting Parties \"agreed to protect companies based on constitution in accordance with law and registered office in their territory\", and rejected all of Algeria's proposals to impose additional requirements.198\n\nC-PHB 2, paras. 15-22.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Belgium's earliest draft of the BIT defined investors from Belgium and Luxembourg as \"\u2018Companies', i.e. any legal person constituted in accordance with Belgian or Luxembourg legislation and having its registered office [ *si\u00e8ge social* ] in the territory of Belgium or Luxembourg\".199 Subsequently, Algeria proposed a draft exchange of letters that would be attached to the BIT and that would define \"[n]ational investors or companies\" as \"those that have their principal center of economic interest in Belgium or Luxembourg, under the Algerian legislation in force concerning investments by non-residents in Algeria\".200 The Claimant argues that the BLEU rejected this proposal, and asked the Respondent to \"abandon [its] amendment concerning the definition of investors\".201 The Claimant underscores that the BLEU also expressed concern that Algeria continued to seek to \"exclude from the benefits of the Agreement multinational companies and to give advantages to... those which have their center of principal activities in the BLEU\".202 A proposal by the BLEU that each party define its respective investors on its own terms was then rejected by Algeria.203\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 16, discussing Draft BIT dated September 1980, Art. 1(1) (*Travaux* at 2-16).\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 18.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 18.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 19, referring to Letter from Belgium Embassy in Algeria to \"belext bru\", 19 March 1991 (*Travaux* at 139).\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 19, discussing Letter from Belgium Embassy in Algeria to \"belext bru\", 19 March 1991 (*Travaux* at 139).\n\n230.\n\nThe Claimant further highlights that, in a letter dated one week prior to the BIT's conclusion, the BLEU considered the Algerian proposal, consisting of \"excluding investments made in Algeria by physical or legal persons of the BLEU that do not have their \u2018principal center of economic interests' in Belgium or in Luxembourg\", as \"unacceptable\", because it would exclude from the BIT's protection \"investments that are made in Algeria\" by \"the numerous BLEU companies that realize the most important part of their activities abroad\" and \"the numerous BLEU companies that have capital held by shareholders of other countries\".204 The Claimant also underscores that the BLEU expressly referred to excerpts from *Barcelona Traction* as reflecting a \"traditional rule\" requiring constitution in accordance with law and \"registered office\" in the home state.205 The Claimant submits that the BLEU concluded \"that the notions of \u2018in accordance with the law of the country' and of \u2018 *si\u00e8ge social* ' are sufficient to define companies, and that all restrictions that are added are not inscribed in the accepted practice of the juridical community and are discriminatory towards our companies that exercise part of their activities abroad or whose capital is held by foreign shareholders\".206\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 20, discussing Letter from Belgium Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 17 April 1991 (*Travaux* at 143144).\n\nC-PHB 2, paras. 20-21, discussing Letter from Belgium Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 17 April 1991 (*Travaux* at 143-144) (which refers to *Barcelona Traction,* para. 70), and Telegram from Belgium Minister of Foreign Affairs to Belgium Ambassador in Algeria (*Travaux* at 145-146).\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 21, citing to Telegram from Belgium Minister of Foreign Affairs to Belgium Ambassador in Algeria (*Travaux* at 145-146).\n\n231.\n\nIn sum, according to the Claimant, the *travaux* definitively confirm that the BLEU insisted -and Algeria agreed - to protect all companies that were constituted in accordance with the law and that have their \"registered office\" in the territory.207\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 22.\n\n232.\n\nFor the Claimant, this conclusion is further reflected in the Explanatory Note submitted to the Belgian Senate on 8 November 1995 for purposes of ratifying the BIT. The Note records that during the negotiations, Algeria proposed \"to exclude from the benefit of the treaty any investments made in Algeria by natural or juridical persons of the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union that did not have the \u2018center of their economic activities in Belgium or in Luxembourg'\", but that \"[t]his proposal was unacceptable\" and the Belgian negotiators \"were able to convince our Algerian partners to adopt our traditional formula for the definition of investors and the contents of the agreement reached faithfully reflects our current practice\".208 For the Claimant, it is clear that Belgium's \"traditional formula\" is to give the term *si\u00e8ge social* its ordinary meaning of \"registered office\", as is shown by the BLEU's Model BIT, which is in English, and by the 26 investment treaties that contain both authentic French and authentic English or Spanish texts, discussed above.209\n\nBelgian Senate, Explanatory Memorandum to the Belgium-Luxembourg - Algeria BIT, 8 November 1995, Exh.

Interpreting** ***si\u00e8ge social*** **as registered office does not render the term ineffective or superfluous**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimant contends that interpreting *si\u00e8ge social* as registered office does not render the term ineffective or superfluous, contrary to what the Respondent asserts. For the Claimant, place of constitution or incorporation and registered office are separate legal concepts, as it also arises from *Barcelona Traction*.210 Referring to the examination of its Luxembourg law expert, the Claimant explains that there can be circumstances in which the two conditions are not fulfilled at the same time, i.e. where a company is constituted in one state and has its registered office in another.211 The Claimant points to the Explanatory Note to the Draft Law Modifying the Luxembourg Company Law in 2005 which states that \"Luxembourg law is a rare exception in Europe in this regard [...] a Luxembourg company can validly transfer its *si\u00e8ge statutaire* abroad and change its *lex societatis* without being dissolved, on the condition that such transfer is unanimously approved by the shareholders and bondholders\".212\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 17-19; Rejoinder, paras. 179-180; C-PHB 1, para. 41; C-PHB 2, para. 24, where the Claimant notes that in *Barcelona Traction*, the ICJ observed in the English text of its decision that \"the traditional rule attributes the right of diplomatic protection of a corporate entity to the State under the laws of which it is incorporated and in whose territory it has its registered office,\" and \"[t]hese two criteria have been confirmed by a long practice and by many international instruments\" (citing to *Barcelona Traction*, para. 70).\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 42.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 42, discussing Explanatory Note to the Draft Law, 23 Dec 2005, Exh.

CLA-264, para. 183.\n\n235.\n\nAs a consequence, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's *effet utile* argument must be dismissed. Were this not the case, the BLEU's Model BIT, which is in English, and the 26 BLEU treaties with authentic English texts granting protection to companies based on the dual requirements of constitution and \"registered office\" would all run afoul of the principle of effective interpretation.215 Finally, the Claimant notes the Respondent's concession that a company may dissociate its registered office from its place of constitution in \"very rare\" circumstances, which is fatal to the Respondent's effective interpretation argument.216\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 45.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 26.\n\n**v. The** ***Tenaris and Talta*** **tribunal's interpretation of** ***si\u00e8ge social*** **in the BLEU-Venezuela BIT is inapposite to this case**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the *Tenaris and Talta* award confirms that the Claimant's *si\u00e8ge social* is in Luxembourg and that the Tribunal should affirm jurisdiction.217\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, paras. 2-75.\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimant first argues that *Tenaris and Talta* confirms that the BIT must be interpreted in accordance with the VCLT and principles of international law and that there is no basis to impose additional nationality requirements, based on domestic laws, which are not provided for in the BIT.218\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, paras. 7-12.\n\n238.\n\nHowever, so the Claimant contends, the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal's finding that *si\u00e8ge social* means \"place of effective management\" is erroneous and should not be relied upon by this Tribunal to interpret *si\u00e8ge social* in Article 1(1)(b) of the BLEU-Algeria BIT.219 For the Claimant, the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal failed to apply the ordinary meaning of *si\u00e8ge social*, which is registered office. While the Claimant agrees with the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal's observation that \"a \u2018term' may have a number of ordinary meanings'\",220 the evidence shows that the ordinary meaning of *si\u00e8ge social* is \"registered office\" and that the term \"place of effective management\" is not an alternative ordinary meaning.221\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, paras. 13-34.\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, para. 15.\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, para. 15.\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimant in particular notes that it does not appear that any of the dictionaries submitted into evidence in this arbitration were submitted to the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal.222 Further, the tribunal's finding that only \"a proportion of Belgo-Luxembourg BITs translate \u2018 *si\u00e8ge social* ' as \u2018registered office'\", which in the tribunal's view was not \"sufficiently conclusive\", is not supported by the record of these proceedings.223\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, para. 16.\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, para. 16.\n\n240.\n\nMoreover, contrary to the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal's conclusion on this point, interpreting *si\u00e8ge social* to mean \"registered office\" does not render the term ineffective, in violation of the principle of effectiveness. The Claimant submits that it is undisputed in these proceedings that a company may validly transfer its registered office outside of Luxembourg without reconstituting and, therefore, that constitution and registered office have different meanings. The expert testimony, documentary evidence, and submissions in these proceedings thus are fundamentally inapposite to the findings of the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal and, indeed, are fatal to the view that the dual requirements of constitution and registered office are superfluous.224\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, para. 29.\n\n241.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal's interpretation is further contrary to the *travaux* of the BLEU-Algeria BIT, which confirm the ordinary meaning of \"registered office\".225\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, paras. 35-39.\n\n**b.

This presumption \"may be overturned only in exceptional situations in which it is flagrantly obvious that the *si\u00e8ge statutaire* is not where the company's central administration is located\".234 The burden of proof is thus high, in particular in the absence of a shareholder decision to move the *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* abroad.235\n\nRejoinder, paras. 188-189; C-PHB 1, para. 50; Pr\u00fcm First Expert Report, para. 20.

The only factors which are relevant to assess whether the Claimant's place of effective management is in Luxembourg are whether (a) the general meetings of shareholders and the meetings of the Board of Managers take place in Luxembourg (which, so says the Claimant, is the most relevant factor, as this is where the company's management decisions become effective); (b) the corporate and accounting records are maintained in Luxembourg; (c) administrative services are provided in Luxembourg; and (d) the company's correspondence is generally addressed to and sent from Luxembourg.236 The Claimant also notes that these factors are relaxed for holding companies such as the Claimant,237 and that Corbiau's abstract description of the real seat as \"the heart and the brain\" of a company is more poetry than law.238\n\nRejoinder, para. 193.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 58.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 59.\n\n247.\n\nIn this context, the Claimant has further developed the following arguments. First, in its submission, it is established that all of the Claimant's general meetings of shareholders and meetings of the Board of Managers were held in Luxembourg.239 In support, the Claimant refers to the minutes which confirm that such meetings took place in Luxembourg in accordance with Luxembourg law and the Claimant's Articles of Association.240 The fact that shareholders were represented by proxies, or that the Board met by teleconference, or that the Board took decisions through circular resolutions does not alter this conclusion.241 Luxembourg law and the Claimant's Articles of Association authorize these practices and provide that meetings held by teleconference or circular resolution are deemed to have taken place in Luxembourg.242 The residence or travel itinerary of the Claimant's controlling shareholder, Mr. Sawiris (who, the Respondent notes, has travelled to Luxembourg on only two occasions) are irrelevant for the purposes of locating the place of the Board or shareholder meetings or of the Claimant's real seat.243\n\nRejoinder, paras. 194-196; C-PHB 1, paras. 60-73; C-PHB 2, paras. 29-40.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 24, 26; C-PHB 1, para. 60.\n\nRejoinder, para. 195.\n\nRejoinder, para. 195; C-PHB 1, para. 61.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 29-30; Rejoinder, paras. 196-197; C-PHB 2, paras. 32-33.\n\n248.\n\nFurther, contrary to what the Respondent and its expert, Prof. Kinsch, suggest, a company does not lose its nationality because its board meetings are \"purely formal\" or \"passively recording decisions that are actually made abroad\". The decisions of the board are not purely formal; they bind the company and only these decisions may produce legal effects.244 If the Respondent were right, a company's *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* would shift depending on the place where a shareholder or manager unilaterally takes decisions. This cannot be the meaning of Luxembourg law, which must fix the *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* for the benefit of the company and third parties.245\n\nRejoinder, para. 198, discussing Schmitt Second Expert Report, para. 23.\n\nRejoinder, para. 198, discussing Schmitt Second Expert Report, para. 27.\n\n249.\n\nIn addition, the evidence reflects that the Board of Managers has managed the Claimant in accordance with Luxembourg law and the Articles of Association. The Claimant's B Managers held a veto over any particular decision. They performed their obligations pursuant to their fiduciary duties, and reviewed and discussed each proposed transaction to determine whether it was in the company's best interest.246 The Claimant relies in particular on Mr. Bourgon's testimony, who confirmed that he had no obligation to agree with Mr. Sawiris' proposal and always had \"the power to say no\".247 For the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to point to any board decision not in the company's best interest which the B Managers would have had to reject.248 It is also very common in Luxembourg that professional managers serve on multiple boards and there is no limitation of the number of boards on which a professional manager may sit under Luxembourgish law.249\n\nRejoinder, para. 199.\n\nC-PHB 1, paras. 65-67; C-PHB 2, para. 36.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 67.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 36; C-PHB 1, para. 72; C-PHB 2, para. 37.\n\n250.\n\nThere is also nothing unusual about the Board's decision to authorize Mr. Sawiris or other individuals to negotiate and conclude significant contracts, as such delegation of authority is provided in the company's Articles of Association and reflects standard practice.250\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 37-38; C-PHB 2, para. 39.\n\n251.\n\nSecond, the Claimant's corporate and accounting records are maintained at its registered office in Luxembourg.251 The Claimant cites Mr. Bourgon's evidence, according to which \"[a]ll corporate and legal documents, such as the register of registered shares, the annual accounts, documents reflecting OTMTI's securities, and minutes of the Board of Managers meetings are maintained at OTMTI's registered office\".252\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 41.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 41, discussing Bourgon Statement, para. 9.\n\n252.\n\nThird, from its inception, all of the Claimant's administrative services, including book-keeping and accounting were provided in Luxembourg.253 For the Claimant, the use of domiciliation agents (such as the company Intertrust, used by the Claimant from 2005 to 2010) is common in Luxembourg. In any event, from 2010, the Claimant acquired its own premises and hired its own employees. It further retained and paid Luxembourgish lawyers, accountants, and other service providers to render administrative services.\n\nRejoinder, para. 200; C-PHB 1, paras. 74-82; C-PHB 2, paras. 42-44.\n\n253.\n\nFourth, the Claimant's correspondence generally was sent to and from Luxembourg.254 The Claimant emphasizes that, based on his review of the files, Mr. Catala confirmed that \"all correspondence addressed to Weather Investments II\" was received and archived at Claimant's registered office.255\n\nC-PHB 1, paras. 83-87; C-PHB 2, paras. 45-47.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 45.\n\n254.\n\nMoreover, out of the contracts entered into by the Claimant, only five (signed in May or August 2005) provided for notices to be sent to an address in Egypt and one to an address in Italy. However, so the Claimant argues, the Claimant specifically represented in all of these contracts that it was domiciled in Luxembourg.256 Additionally, it is not uncommon nor unlawful for companies to designate a location other than their registered office for purposes of receiving correspondence and notices pertaining to particular transactions.257 And while, according to the Claimant, four of Banca IMI's statements mistakenly indicate that the Claimant's corporate accounting department was located in Cairo, Banca IMI sent all of its correspondence to the Claimant's registered office in Luxembourg.258 Beyond these factors, none of the other elements cited by the Respondent are relevant to locate the Claimant's place of management.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 86.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 87.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 46.\n\n255.\n\nFinally, no court in any of the Contracting BIT Parties has ever found that a company in the Claimant's situation had dissociated its real seat from its registered office.259 This is particularly true for Luxembourg, where no court has ever found that a company constituted and having its registered office there lost its Luxembourg nationality by transferring its real seat abroad.260 As to the Belgian cases relied upon by the Respondent, more than half concerned whether the company's real seat was in one rather than another Belgian city, and the Belgian courts have only deemed a company's real seat to be a fiction in extraordinary circumstances not present in this arbitration.261 In the same vein, the Egyptian authorities have never contended that the Claimant is an Egyptian company.262\n\nRejoinder, para. 192; C-PHB 1, paras. 88-95; C-PHB 2, para. 48.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 88.\n\nC-PHB 1, paras. 90-93, discussing Gand Court of Appeals, 2 October 1997, Exh.

The Claimant in particular points to the factors that the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal considered relevant in determining whether a company has its real seat in Luxembourg (namely, the places where the directors meet; the place where the shareholders meet (the \"really decisive factor\", according to that tribunal), and the place where the books and records of the company are being kept).263 For the Claimant, it is undisputed that all of the Claimant's general meetings of shareholders have been held at its registered office in Luxembourg and the Claimant also holds its Board meetings and maintains its records in Luxembourg, thus satisfying all of the *Tenaris and Talta* factors. The Claimant also has retained Luxembourgish auditors and lawyers, and generally receives and sends its correspondence at its registered office. Thus, the Claimant has all of the same links to Luxembourg that were relied on by the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal to determine that Tenaris' real seat is located in Luxembourg.264\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, paras. 46-48.\n\nClaimant's Submission in response to the Tribunal's questions, paras. 49-75.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**a. Articulation between Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the requirements*****ratione personae*** **in the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal begins by recalling that the Claimant must fulfil the jurisdictional requirements *ratione personae* under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT.265 More specifically, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires that disputes submitted to arbitration be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. Article 9 of the BIT, in turn, provides for the settlement of \"[a]ny investment dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party\".266\n\nSee also *KT Asia Investment Group B.V. v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/8, Award, 17 October 2013, Exh. RL-81, para. 96 [hereinafter *KT Asia* ].\n\nBIT, Exh. C-658, Art. 9(1).\n\n258.\n\nWhile the requirement *ratione personae* under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention has not formed the primary focus of the Parties' pleadings, which have chiefly addressed the definition of \"investor\" in the BIT, it is undisputed that the BIT Contracting Parties enjoy wide latitude in defining what entities are to be considered as nationals for the purpose of the ICSID Convention.\n\n259.\n\nThus, according to the Respondent:\n\nL'absence de d\u00e9finition de la nationalit\u00e9 d'une personne morale dans la Convention CIRDI laisse le soin aux \u00c9tats contractants de d\u00e9finir, dans les accords de protection des investissements, les crit\u00e8res permettant de d\u00e9terminer la nationalit\u00e9 d'une personne morale au sens desdits accords(30).\n\n(30) Voir M\u00e9moire en R\u00e9ponse, \u00b6 159. Cette approche a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par plusieurs tribunaux : voir, par exemple, Pi\u00e8ce RL-69, Rompetrol Group (CIRDI ARB/06/3, 18 avril 2008), \u00b6\u00b6 81-82 ; Pi\u00e8ce RL-81, KT Asia (CIRDI ARB/09/8, 17 octobre 2013), \u00b6 113.

See also, in almost identical terms, Reply, para. 159.\n\n260.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimant has argued that:\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention does not define \"nationality.\" Rather,\n\n\u2018[a]s ICSID tribunals and commentators have regularly observed, the drafters of the Convention abandoned efforts to define \u2018nationality' for the purposes of Article 25, and instead left the States Parties wide latitude to agree on the criteria by which nationality would be determined.'\n\n[...]\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that, under the ICSID Convention, the Contracting Parties had discretion to determine in the BIT the criteria for assessing a juridical entity's nationality for purposes of the BIT.268\n\nRejoinder, paras. 140-142, citing to *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 18 April 2008, Exh. RL-69, paras. 80, 81, 83, 92 [hereafter *Rompetrol* ]; *KT Asia,* paras. 113, 121-122.\n\n261.\n\nIndeed, as can be seen from the excerpts quoted above, both Parties have invoked the same legal authorities in this particular respect. In particular, both Parties rely on *Rompetrol* and *KT Asia*.\n\n262.\n\nIn *Rompetrol,* the tribunal observed as follows:\n\n80. As ICSID tribunals and commentators have regularly observed, the drafters of the Convention abandoned efforts to define \"nationality\" for the purposes of Article 25, and instead left the States Parties wide latitude to agree on the criteria by which nationality would be determined. At the same time, it is also widely recognized that, as both Parties to this arbitration accept, Article 25 reflects objective \u2018outer limits' beyond which party consent would be ineffective.\n\n81. In the Tribunal's view, the latitude granted to define nationality for purposes of Article 25 must be at its greatest in the context of corporate nationality under a BIT, where, by definition, it is the Contracting Parties to the BIT themselves, having under international law the sole power to determine national status under their own law, who decide by mutual and reciprocal agreement which persons or entities will be treated as their \u2018nationals' for the purposes of enjoying the benefits the BIT is intended to confer. Drawing on concepts of private international law, the Respondent says that there is no such thing as a \u2018nationality' of corporate entities in the same sense as for physical persons. To the extent that that were so, it would reinforce the point: not only does each Contracting Party have the sole authority to determine the status of juridical entities under its own law, but the Contracting Parties jointly have the sole authority to determine the criteria by which juridical persons with a defined status under each other's law may enjoy the protections of their BIT.\n\n82. To determine the criteria by which the Contracting Parties to a BIT have agreed that nationality would be determined for its purposes, we must look, of course, to the BIT itself.. [\u2026] Given the latitude granted to States under the ICSID Convention to settle the applicable nationality criteria, there is nothing illogical in looking first of all to whether the nationality criteria set forth in the BIT are satisfied before going on to examine whether there is anything in Article 25 of the Convention which stands in the way of giving effect to that. In any event, the Tribunal cannot see that anything of substance turns on the order of the analysis - and certainly not in the circumstances of this case.\n\n[\u2026] Hence the question becomes simply, what did these two States themselves agree to of their own free will in concluding the BIT? The Tribunal therefore holds that the definition of national status given in The Netherlands-Romania BIT is decisive for the purpose of establishing its jurisdiction.269\n\n*Rompetrol*, paras. 81-83, internal footnotes omitted.\n\n263.\n\nIn *KT Asia,* the tribunal observed as follows:\n\n113. It is common ground that the ICSID Convention does not impose any particular test for the nationality of juridical persons not having the nationality of the host State, be it the place of incorporation, or the effective seat, or control. This leaves broad discretion to Contracting States to define nationality, and particularly corporate nationality, under the relevant BIT. Kazakhstan and the Netherlands have used that discretion by agreeing on the following definition of a \"national\" in Article 1 of the BIT [\u2026].270\n\n*KT Asia*, para. 113 (internal footnote omitted).\n\n264.\n\nThe tribunals in *Mobil v. Venezuela*271 and *SOABI v. Senegal272* (both relied on by the Respondent) have taken similar views. Also according to Prof. Schreuer,\n\nDefinitions of corporate nationality in national legislation or in treaties providing for ICSID's jurisdiction are directly relevant to the determination of whether the nationality requirements of Art. 25(2)(b) have been met. They are part of the legal framework for the host State's submission to the Centre. Upon acceptance in writing by the investor [\u2026], they become part of the agreement on consent between the parties. Therefore, any reasonable determination of the nationality of juridical persons contained in national legislation or in a treaty should be accepted by an ICSID commission or tribunal. This conclusion was expressly confirmed in *Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine*.273\n\nSee *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro negro Holding, Ltd., Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Holdings, Inc., Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., and Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, Exh. CLA-117, paras. 156-157 [hereinafter *Mobil v. Venezuela* ] (\"156. The Tribunal observes that Article 25 fixes the \"outer limits\" of ICSID jurisdiction and that parties can consent to that jurisdiction only within those limits. 157. However Article 25 (b) (i) does not impose any particular criteria of nationality (whether place of incorporation, *si\u00e8ge social* or control) in the case of juridical persons not having the nationality of the Host State. Thus the parties to the Dutch-Venezuela BIT were free to consider as nationals both the legal persons constituted under the law 43 of one of the Parties and those constituted under another law, but controlled by such legal persons. The BIT is thus compatible with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\").\n\n*Soabi v. Republic of Senegal*, ICSID Case No. ARB/82/1, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 July 1984, Exh. RL-224, para. 29 (\" *29.

CLA-142, paras. 106 *et seq.* [hereinafter *Aucoven* ].\n\nSchreuer, *Commentary*, p. 287.\n\n265.\n\nThe same view was expressed by Aron Broches, the former General Counsel of the World Bank, who chaired the consultative meetings at which the preliminary draft of the ICSID Convention was discussed:\n\nThe purpose of [Article 25(2)(b)], as well as of Article 25 (1), is to indicate the outer limits within which disputes may be submitted to conciliation or arbitration under the auspices of the Centre with the consent of the parties thereto. Therefore the parties should be given the widest possible latitude to agree on the meaning of \u2018nationality' and any stipulation of nationality made in connection with a conciliation or arbitration clause which is based on a reasonable criterion should be accepted.274\n\nAron Broches, The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, 136 Recueil des Cours 331 (1972-II), pp. 360-361.\n\n266.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with those authorities and considers that \"while the ICSID Convention sets objective outer limits to jurisdiction by requiring nationality, it does not specify the test for nationality\".275 Hence, the Contracting States have - in Aron Broches' terms - the \"widest possible latitude to agree on the meaning of \u2018nationality'\", provided they use a \"reasonable criterion\".276 Such meaning of nationality is agreed in the instrument granting consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre (a contract, a domestic legislation, or an investment treaty, as the case may be).\n\n*KT Asia*, para. 121 (internal footnote omitted).\n\nAron Broches, *loc. cit*. in fn 274.\n\n267.\n\nThe question is thus whether - to use Prof. Schreuer's and Aron Broches' words - the instrument granting consent to the Centre (here the BIT) defines nationality by reference to a \"reasonable determination\" or \"reasonable criterion\" within the \"outer limits\" of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal considers that the definition of nationality in the instrument of consent is reasonable \"as long as the requirements are not deprived of their objective significance\".277 As noted by the tribunal in *KT Asia* in the excerpt quoted above, generally accepted criteria for the determination of nationality of a juridical person include the place of incorporation, the effective seat, and control.278 Similarly, *Aucoven* noted that \"[a]ccording to international law and practice, there are different possible criteria to determine a juridical person's nationality. The most widely used is the place of incorporation or registered office. Alternatively, the place of the central administration or effective seat may also be taken into consideration\".279 Any of those determinations would thus be reasonable also for the purposes of jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.\n\nSee *Aucoven*, para. 99 (referring to the jurisdictional requirements in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and noting that \"to determine whether these objective requirements are met in a given case, one needs to refer to the parties\u2018 own understanding or definition.

The term \"investors\" shall mean:\n\n(a) \"Nationals\", i.e. any natural person who, under the legislation of the Contracting States, is deemed a citizen of Belgium or Luxembourg or who has Algerian nationality;\n\n(b) \"Companies\", i.e. any legal person constituted in accordance with Belgian, Luxembourg or Algerian legislation and having its registered office in the territory of Belgium, Luxembourg or Algeria.\n\n270.\n\nIt is undisputed that, to be an \"investor\" under the BIT, a company must be (i) constituted in accordance with Luxembourg/Belgian/Algerian law (in this case, Luxembourg law) and (ii) have its *siege social* there. The disputed question is what *siege social* means.\n\n271.\n\nThe starting point is that the definition of investor is a requirement contained in a treaty and, as such, it is subject to the rules of interpretation codified in the VCLT. The Tribunal will interpret Article 1(1)(b) of BIT by applying those rules of interpretation pursuant to Article 31 (*infra* at i) and 32 (*infra* at ii) of the VCLT.\n\n**i. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention**\n------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nAccording to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty \"shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". The starting point of the interpretation is the \"ordinary meaning\" of the text. The latter must be ascertained in the light of the context and the treaty's object and purpose, any subsequent agreement or practice of the Contracting Parties related to the interpretation of the treaty, and any other relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Contracting Parties.281\n\nArticle 31 of the VCLT.\n\n273.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the term *siege social* is not univocal. In and of themselves, these terms merely refer to the seat of a corporation, as opposed to anything else, for instance an arbitral tribunal. Beyond that, a corporate seat or *siege social* can either be *statutaire*, referring to the seat appearing in the company's bylaws or statutes, or *r\u00e9el*, referring to the effective seat where the company is actually managed. In that sense, the Tribunal agrees with the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal that such term is \"susceptible of either a formal or substantive meaning\".282\n\n*Tenaris and Talta*, para. 144.\n\n274.\n\nTo clarify the ordinary meaning of the term, one must take account of the fact that it may be used in different areas of the law. First, it may be used in national law for domestic purposes. For example, the Luxembourg Company Law normally uses the term *si\u00e8ge social* with the connotation of *si\u00e8ge social statutaire* having the same meaning as \"registered office\".283 Further, the term may be used as a connecting factor in private international law to determine the nationality or the *lex societatis* of a company. In that sense, a number of countries define corporate nationality by reference to the place of incorporation, whereas others adopt the criterion of the effective seat or place of management. In addition, there may be further areas of domestic law referring to the nationality of corporations, such as those relating to the trade with enemy countries, sanctions, and taxation. A different area is that of customary international law dealing with nationality for purposes of diplomatic protection. Finally, still in international law, there are provisions in treaties defining \"nationals\" (including corporations) for the subject matters of these treaties. This is true of treaties for the protection on foreign investments, like the present BIT, and of certain bilateral tax treaties, peace treaties, agreements on reparation for war losses, and others.\n\nSee, e.g., Article 27 Luxembourg Law of 10 August 1915 on companies (\" *Loi luxembourgeoise sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s commerciales* \"), as amended by the law of 21 December 2006 (hereinafter \"Luxembourg Company Law\"), Exh. C-726, which provides that the *si\u00e8ge social* is the seat stated in the \" *acte de soci\u00e9t\u00e9* \", *i.e.*, the articles of incorporation. See also other references to the term *si\u00e8ge social* in the Luxembourg Company Law applicable to the S\u00e0rl or the SA that refer to the *si\u00e8ge social* designated in Article 27, e.g., Articles 39, 70, 73, 76, 187, 198. See also the Explanatory Note to the 1999 Law, introducing the presumption that *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* (*recte*, *administration centrale* or *principal \u00e9tablissement*, as it was then) is found at the statutory seat, where the Luxembourg legislature treated the term *si\u00e8ge social* as having the same meaning as *si\u00e8ge statutaire* and, conversely, distinguished *si\u00e8ge social* from \" *principal \u00e9tablissement* \":  \n*Le paragraphe (1) \u00e9nonce une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale pour d\u00e9terminer la situation du* *domicile de toute soci\u00e9t\u00e9, luxembourgeoise ou \u00e9trang\u00e8re.

C-732, at 8 (emphasis added).\n\n275.\n\nGiven the variety of these legal domains, it is important to recognize that the principles on the determination of nationality in one framework do not necessarily apply in another framework,284 which was not always apparent from the Parties' pleadings. Indeed, the meaning of a term in one framework may not be the same in other legal areas.\n\nSee *also* Vaughan Lowe, *Injuries to Corporations*, in *The Law of International Responsibility* (Crawford, Pellet and Olleson, Eds., OUP, 2010), pp. 1005-1021, at 1008.\n\n276.\n\nWith this distinction in mind, the Tribunal has approached the threshold issue in dispute between the Parties, namely whether, pursuant to international law, the term *si\u00e8ge social* in the BIT must be interpreted by reference to nationality criteria under the applicable national law, as Algeria argues, or whether the BIT embodies an autonomous notion of investor nationality, as OTMTI submits.\n\n277.\n\nIf one were to follow the argument that *\"si\u00e8ge social\"* in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT refers to domestic nationality requirements, it is undisputed by all experts, including the Claimant's Luxembourg law expert, Prof. Pr\u00fcm,285 that the nationality of a company under Luxembourg law is determined by the *si\u00e8ge de l\u2019administration centrale* of the company (formerly, *principal \u00e9tablissement*), which is presumed to be at the *si\u00e8ge statutaire*.286 This flows from Articles 159 and 2 of the Luxembourg Company Law, which provide as follows:\n\n***Art. 159.***\n\n*(Loi du 25 ao\u00fbt 2006)*\n\n*\u00abToute soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont*  ***l'administration centrale***  *est situ\u00e9e au Grand-Duch\u00e9, est soumise \u00e0 la loi luxembourgeoise, bien que l\u2019acte constitutif ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 en pays \u00e9tranger.\u00bb*\n\n*(Loi du 31 mai 1999)*\n\n*\u00abLorsqu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a son*  ***domicile***  *au Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg, elle est de*  ***nationalit\u00e9***  *luxembourgeoise et*  ***la loi luxembourgeoise lui est pleinement appliqu\u00e9e*** *.*\n\n*Lorsqu\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a son domicile \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, mais qu\u2019elle a au Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg un ou plusieurs si\u00e8ges quelconques d\u2019op\u00e9ration, le lieu de son \u00e9tablissement le plus important au Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg, qu\u2019elle indique \u00e0 cet effet dans la publication de ses actes prescrite par la loi, constitue le domicile secondaire de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg. \u00bb*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n***Art. 2.***  *:*\n\n*Le*  ***domicile***  *de toute soci\u00e9t\u00e9 commerciale est situ\u00e9 au*  ***si\u00e8ge de l'administration centrale***  *de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.

See Kinsch, First Expert Report, paras. 1017. It appears undisputed that both terms are understood to indicate the *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el*. See Kinsch, First Expert Report, paras. 11, 15; Pr\u00fcm, Second Expert Report, paras. 4, 9.\n\nLuxembourg Company law, Exh. RL-177, (emphasis added).\n\n278.\n\nThis being so, in application of Article 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal cannot agree that the requirement of *si\u00e8ge social* in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT refers to domestic nationality requirements. The grammatical and syntactic structure of the provision and the context in which the term *si\u00e8ge social* is employed make it clear that for corporations the BIT provides its autonomous or treaty-specific requirement *ratione personae*. While Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT makes reference to domestic nationality requirements in respect of *individuals*288 and Article 1(1)(b) also operates a similar *renvoi* to national law for the constitution of a corporation, no reference to national law applies to *si\u00e8ge social*.289\n\nSee BIT, Article 1(1)(a) (\"'Nationals', I.e. any natural person who, under the legislation of the Contracting States, is deemed a citizen of Belgium or Luxembourg or who has Algerian nationality\", emphasis added).\n\nThis was also noted in *Tenaris and Talta* in respect of the similarly worded provision in the BIT applicable in that case. See *Tenaris and Talta,* para. 165. The requirement in Article 1(1)(b) that the company be \" constituted in accordance with Belgian, Luxembourg or Algerian legislation [...]\" only refers to incorporation modalities, not to the law governing nationality.\n\n279.\n\nHad the Contracting Parties wished to refer to the domestic nationality criteria, they would have linked the BIT requirements *ratione personae* to their domestic law. For that they could either have taken the same approach as for individuals, i.e. they would have defined corporate investors as those which are deemed to have the nationality of a Contracting Party according to that State's laws, or referred directly to those connecting factors which, under their laws, define corporate nationality (e.g., for Luxembourg \" *domicile* \" or \" *principal \u00e9tablissement* \" as it stood in 1991, when the BIT was concluded or, in current terminology, \" *administration centrale* \").290 Moreover, and importantly, under no reading of the BIT does the term *si\u00e8ge social* (whether *statutaire* or *r\u00e9el*) correspond to the Contracting Parties' domestic law tests for the determination of nationality of corporations. Indeed, while the BIT defines \"investor\" by reference to both \"constitution in accordance with law\" *and* *\"si\u00e8ge social\u2019,* under Belgian and Luxembourg law nationality is determined only by reference to *principal \u00e9tablissement* or *administration centrale*, the place of constitution playing no role in that determination. In reality, the role of the place of constitution is expressly disavowed for such purpose and the Belgian and Luxembourgish legislations recognize that place of constitution and *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* (*recte*, *principal \u00e9tablissement* or *administration centrale*) may be located in different states.291 This also confirms that the BIT Contracting Parties incorporated in the BIT a test that differs from the nationality tests under their domestic laws, providing instead for an autonomous notion \" *for the purposes of this Agreement* \", as the *chapeau* of Article 1 expressly states.292\n\nSee also in similar terms, Belgian *Code de droit international priv\u00e9*, 16 July 2004, RL-139, Art. 110 (criterion of \" *\u00e9tablissement principal* \") and, previously, Belgian *Code des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s*, 7 May 1999, RL-136, Article 56 (criterion of \" *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* \") and Belgian *Lois coordonn\u00e9es sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s commerciales*, RL-138, Article 197 (\" *principal \u00e9tablissement\").* Furthermore, as already noted *supra* in fn. 283, within the very context of determining nationality for purposes of domestic law, the Luxembourg legislature treated the term *si\u00e8ge social* as having the same meaning as *si\u00e8ge statutaire* and, conversely, distinguished *si\u00e8ge social* from *\"principal \u00e9tablissement\"* (or in the Parties' terminology *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el*). See Explanatory Note to Bill No. 4328, Exh. C-732, at 8.\n\nSee Luxembourg Company Law, RL-177, Art. 159 (\"Toute soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont l'administration centrale est situ\u00e9e au Grand-Duch\u00e9, est soumise \u00e0 la loi luxembourgeoise, *bien que l\u2019acte constitutif ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 en pays \u00e9tranger* \", emphasis added); Art. 197 des lois coordonn\u00e9es sur les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s commerciales, Exh. RL-138 (\"Toute soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont le principal \u00e9tablissement est en Belgique est soumise \u00e0 la loi belge, *bien que l'acte constitutif ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 en pays \u00e9tranger* \", emphasis added), and Art. 56, *Code des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s*, 7 May 1999, Exh. RL-136 (\"Une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont le si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el est en Belgique est soumise \u00e0 la loi belge, *bien que l'acte constitutif ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 en pays \u00e9tranger* \", emphasis added).\n\nThe specification that the BIT definitions are given \"for the purposes of the BIT\" also implies that they have no impact on the other contexts in which issues of nationality of corporations are relevant.\n\n280.\n\nThere is nothing unusual for contracting states to adopt an autonomous notion of a term used in a treaty that may differ from the meaning(s) under national law. The resort to autonomous notions or interpretations, that are independent from national legal concepts, is a technique often used to ensure the uniform application of a treaty, for example in treaties laying down uniform rules of private law or private international law rules. As Richard Gardiner notes, \"[these] treaties are applied within national legal systems; but though the terms used in them are often drawn from concepts in use in national legal systems, once included in treaties they no longer attract the possibly varying character that they have nationally but assume a single meaning under the treaty, unless it states otherwise\".293 A prime example of the development of autonomous interpretation of treaty terms is the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union on the interpretation of private international law conventions, such as the 1968 Brussels Convention (subsequently replaced by Regulation 44/2001). This technique may also be used in investment treaties, and this is certainly so for this BIT for the reasons which the Tribunal has described above.\n\nSee Richard Gardiner, *Treaty Interpretation* (OUP, 2008), at 32.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that *si\u00e8ge social* has an autonomous meaning for the purposes of the BIT. As a consequence, the next task is to establish the actual meaning of that autonomous notion of *si\u00e8ge social*.\n\n282.\n\nThe BIT was concluded in French, Dutch, and Arabic, all three texts being equally authentic. Pursuant to Article 33(3) of the VCLT, \"[t]he terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text\". There is no dispute between the Parties that the term *si\u00e8ge social* in the French language version has the same meaning as the corresponding terms in the Dutch and Arabic versions.294 The dispute is about what this term means. The Tribunal notes in this respect that, despite the three languages being equally authentic, initially both Parties presented arguments almost exclusively based on the French version of the BIT. It was only in reply to an invitation from the Tribunal after the Parties' Post-hearing Briefs that they put forward materials and submissions on the Dutch and Arabic versions of the Treaty.295 As is shown in the subsequent analysis, the Tribunal has considered all three language versions, although the French version has attracted particular focus as a result of the Parties' pleadings and the fact that the BIT was negotiated in French (on which see *infra* at ii).\n\nLetter from Respondent, 11 March 2011, pp. 2-3; Letter from Respondent, 21 April 2016, p. 1; Claimant's Rebuttal to Respondent's 11 March 2016 Submission, 21 April 2016, para. 7.\n\nSee letter from the Tribunal, 12 February 2016 (inviting the Parties' comments on \"[t]he meaning of Article 1(1)(b), and in particular of the term \u2018 *si\u00e8ge social'*, in the Dutch and Arabic versions of the [Treaty]\") and the Parties' respective submissions on this issue, 11 March, 21 April, and 28 April 2016.\n\n283.\n\nThe record includes excerpts of a number of dictionaries to which the Parties, and especially the Claimant, have referred. It is well established that tribunals may rely on dictionary definitions to elucidate the ordinary meaning of a term296 and a number of investor-state tribunals have done so.297 With one exception,298 the French and dual language dictionaries on record, establish that the ordinary meaning of *si\u00e8ge social* is \"registered office\" and that other terms, namely *si\u00e8ge principal* or *si\u00e8ge de la direction d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9*, are used to define \"head office\" or \"place of management\".299\n\nSee, e.g., *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

The latter is defined as the \"place from which the company is actually conducted in light of where the board of directors and the general assembly meetings are held or where the bookkeeping is being kept\", or as the \"connecting factor in private international law for the purpose of determining the law governing the company\".301\n\nLycaeus Jurdisch Woordenboek, Exh.

C-1083, at 364 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n285.\n\nBy contrast to the French and Dutch terms, the evidence with regard to the term \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\" in the authentic Arabic version of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, which appears to be a literal translation of *si\u00e8ge social*, is more limited and thus not helpful to the Tribunal.302\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the translators' notes attached to the Respondent's letter of 11 March 2016 and has not been assisted by them in its analysis of the Dutch and Arabic terms of the Treaty.\n\n286.\n\nIn conclusion, the dictionaries in the record indicate that the ordinary meaning of *si\u00e8ge social* is registered office. The Tribunal notes, however, that dictionary meanings are a helpful starting point though not the end of the Tribunal's interpretive inquiry. In particular, the Tribunal must look at the term *si\u00e8ge social* not in isolation but in its broader context of Article 1(1)(b) and in particular in correlation with the criterion of constitution mentioned in the same provision.\n\n287.\n\nIn this respect, the Parties have extensively discussed the principle of *effet utile* or effectiveness. Specifically, Algeria submits that interpreting *si\u00e8ge social* as registered office would render the term superfluous, since Article 1(1)(b) requires incorporation in one of the Contracting Parties and incorporation entails a registered office (*si\u00e8ge statutaire*) on the territory of such Contracting Party. In the same vein, the tribunal in *Tenaris and Talta* interpreted *si\u00e8ge social* in the applicable BIT as real seat essentially on the basis of the principle of effectiveness.303 The Tribunal has extensively reviewed *Tenaris and Talta* and taken into account the Parties' comments on this award. It can, however, not subscribe to the interpretation in that decision, for the reasons discussed in this and the following section, and on the basis of the supplementary means of interpretation available to this Tribunal (*infra* at ii.).\n\nSee *Tenaris and Talta*, paras. 148-152.\n\n288.\n\nIt is undisputed, and rightly so, that the principle of effectiveness plays an important role in the interpretation of treaties. While not expressly included in the VCLT, this canon of interpretation is normally linked to the object and purpose of the treaty and to the principle of good faith,304 and is deemed an integral part of the general rule of interpretation set in Article 31 of the VCLT.305 The principle has often been applied by the ICJ306 and investment tribunals.307 So for instance, in *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*,\n\nNothing is better settled, as a canon of interpretation in all systems of law, than that a clause must be so interpreted as to give it a meaning rather than so as to deprive it of meaning [...]. This is simply an application of the more wider legal principle of \"effectiveness\" which requires favouring the interpretation that gives to each treaty provision \"effet utile\".308\n\nFinal Draft, Introductory Commentary to Arts 27-28, 219 para. 6.

Sri Lanka*, para. 40.\n\n289.\n\nWhile it acknowledges that in most instances the constitution of a company in a Contracting State implies the presence of the registered office in that State, the Tribunal does not consider that interpreting *si\u00e8ge social* as \"registered office\" renders such term meaningless. In its opinion, the Contracting Parties chose in Article 1(1)(b) to define corporate nationality for the purposes of the BIT by reference to the place of incorporation. They did so by naming the two elements normally part of the incorporation test, i.e. \"constitution\" and \"registered office\". In other words, constitution in accordance with local law (i.e. the creation of a company as a legal person within a given system of municipal law) and registered office or *si\u00e8ge statutaire* in the respective State (i.e. the seat appearing in the corporation's constitutive documents) are two elements of one single test (place of incorporation) and not two different tests.\n\n290.\n\nThe \"combination\" of the two conditions of incorporation and registered office as part of one single test was also notably made in *Barcelona Traction.* In the context of the discussion of nationality of corporate entities for purposes of diplomatic protection, the Court held that \"[t]he traditional rule attributes the right of diplomatic protection of a corporate entity to the State under the laws of which it is *incorporated* and in whose territory it has its *registered office* \".309 The Court also noted that \"[t]hese two criteria have been confirmed by long practice and by numerous international instruments\".310\n\n*Barcelona Traction*, para. 70 (emphasis added).\n\n*Barcelona Traction*, para. 70.\n\n291.\n\nIn the commentary to the Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, the International Law Commission (\"ILC\") referred to this passage and noted that:\n\nHere the Court set two conditions for the acquisition of nationality by a corporation for the purposes of diplomatic protection: *incorporation* and the presence of the *registered office* of the company in the State of incorporation.311\n\nDraft Articles on Diplomatic Protection with Commentaries, 2006, Exh. CLA-265, at 53 (emphasis added).\n\n292.\n\n*Barcelona Traction* was of course concerned with nationality for the purposes of diplomatic protection under customary international law, which is not applicable in investment treaty arbitration.312 As was stressed earlier, one must distinguish the different legal frameworks in which nationality issues arise. This is particularly so here, as the ICJ emphasized that it was dealing with the default position in customary international law *in the absence of a treaty*. Specifically, it stated that \"whenever legal issues arise concerning the rights of States with regard to the treatment of companies and shareholders, *as to which rights international law has not established its own rules*, it has to refer to the relevant rules of municipal law\".313 In the present case, international law has established its own rules, i.e. those set out in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT.\n\nThis was held in many investment treaty decisions. See *,* e.g., *Rompetrol*, paras. 86-93 and many other cases, mainly in the context of the issue of shareholders rights, such as *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 17 July 2003, paras. 43-45, available at http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/ita0183.pdf; *LG&E Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v.

See also Zachary Douglas, *The Law of Investment Claims*, paras. 605-609 (\"The rules for the nationality of claims in the general international law of diplomatic protection do not apply to issues of nationality in investment treaty arbitration\"). But see, for a different view, *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale In Respect of DR Energy Holdings Limited and Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S. A. v. The Dominican Republic*, LCIA Case No. UN 7927, UNCITRAL, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008, Exh. CLA-204, p. 34, para. 109 (\"The fact that such treaties have substituted for diplomatic protection and may even prohibit its exercise by the States that are parties to them, does not mean that the basic principles have also been automatically derogated as it is rather the means for materializing an international claim that have changed but not in all aspects its substantive requirements\").\n\n*Barcelona Traction*, para. 38. See also *Rompetrol*, para. 91, discussing paragraph 90 of the *Barcelona Traction* and noting that \"the Court in fact refers to multilateral or bilateral agreements between States for the protection of foreign investments, and to their provisions as to jurisdiction and procedure in the case of disputes over the treatment of corporate investors, and does so in terms which unmistakably connote that, where such an agreement is present, its terms would prevail\".\n\n293.\n\nThe fact that the customary rules on diplomatic protection, as referred to in *Barcelona Traction*, are not directly applicable here does not mean that the Tribunal cannot take account of these rules in its interpretive process.314 This is especially so here as the *travaux* show that the BIT terms were intended to reflect customary international law on corporate nationality for purposes of diplomatic protection.315\n\nSee Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.\n\nSee *infra* at V.B.3.b.ii.\n\n294.\n\nThat said, the Tribunal returns now to the relevant passage of *Barcelona Traction.* The Court there first noted that the \"traditional rule\" for purposes of diplomatic protection was the one based on incorporation and registered office (*constitution* and *si\u00e8ge* in the French language version).316 It is clear that in the context of the \"traditional rule\" the Court views \" *si\u00e8ge* \" as a reference to \" *si\u00e8ge statutaire* \".317 The Court then added that some States require \"further or different links\" to allocate nationality for purposes of diplomatic protection. In particular, the Court referred to States giving diplomatic protection to a company incorporated under their law \"solely when it has its seat (*si\u00e8ge social*) or management or centre of control in their territory\" (\" *uniquement lorsque le si\u00e8ge social, la direction ou le centre de contr\u00f4le de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 se trouve sur leur territoire* \") or \"when a majority or a substantial proportion of the shares has been owned by nationals of the State concerned\".318 In other words, the Court referred to the three usual tests for nationality mentioned above (para. 267), i.e. incorporation, effective seat and control.\n\n*Barcelona Traction*, para. 70.\n\nSee *Barcelona Traction*, para. 71.\n\n*Barcelona Traction*, para. 70. Together with incorporation (and registered office), these two further tests are those generally advanced for nationality. See e.g. the excerpt from *KT Asia*, para. 113, quoted *supra* at para. 267.\n\n295.\n\nThe Court then gave preference to the \"traditional rule\" of incorporation and found that the company had \"manifold links\" with Canada, the State where it was constituted and had its registered office.319 These manifold links included the fact that the company had \"maintained in Canada [...] its accounts and its share registers\", the fact that \"board meetings were held there for many years\" and that \"it ha[d] been listed in the records of the Canadian tax authorities\".320 The Court concluded that \"a close and permanent connection\" (\" *lien \u00e9troit et* *permanent* \") had been established with Canada.321 Incidentally, these are also the links that the Claimant has with Luxembourg in our case.\n\n*Barcelona Traction*, para. 71.\n\n*Barcelona Traction*, para. 71.\n\n*Barcelona Traction*, para. 71.\n\n296.\n\nIn any event, it results from the preceding discussion that the Court viewed \"incorporation\" (\" *constitution* \" in French) and \"registered office\" (\" *si\u00e8ge* \") as two elements of the same test, namely the one based on the place of incorporation, which it regarded as the \"traditional rule\" of nationality for the purposes of diplomatic protection.322 The ILC, in the commentary quoted above, recognized that the Court \"set two conditions\" for the acquisition of nationality, although it acknowledged at the same time that \"the laws of most States require a company incorporated under its laws to maintain a registered office in its territory\". This being so, the Tribunal could not uphold an objection based on the lack of *effet utile* without implying that the mention of registered office in *Barcelona Traction* is meaningless, a step which the Tribunal is not prepared to take. Thus, like the Court set \"two conditions\" within the \"traditional rule\" of nationality for the purposes of diplomatic protection, so equally may a BIT provide for these same two conditions to describe its nationality requirement for purposes of investment treaty protection.\n\nIn *Diallo*, the Court relied on *Barcelona Traction* to conclude that despite the Guinean nationality of Diallo as the sole shareholder in the two companies in question, \"the normal rule of the nationality of the claims\" applied and that having regard to their place of incorporation, \"[t]he companies in question have Congolese nationality\". See *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (* Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007, Exh. CLA-160, p. 582, at 616, para. 94.\n\n297.\n\nIn light of this analysis, the Tribunal can dispense with addressing the Parties' arguments on whether the dissociation between the two requirements is possible or not under Luxembourg law, as the issue is inapposite in the framework of the BIT.\n\n298.\n\nIn conclusion, the context in which the term *si\u00e8ge social* is placed confirms that the term does not refer to domestic nationality rules, but embodies an autonomous treaty-specific meaning. A good faith interpretation of the ordinary meaning of Article 1(1)(b) suggests that *si\u00e8ge social* means *si\u00e8ge social statutaire* or registered office. The object and purpose of the BIT does not point to a different outcome. This conclusion is consistent with the principle of effectiveness as the BIT simply spells out the place of incorporation test by specifying the two elements generally associated with it (constitution in accordance with local law and registered office). This interpretation of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT also takes into account the customary rules on nationality as stated in *Barcelona Traction*, which constitute the background against which the treaty's provision must be viewed, as is shown by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*.\n\n**ii. Supplementary means of interpretation (Article 32 VCLT)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nThe primacy of the text of the Treaty, viewed in its context and bearing in mind the Treaty's object and purpose under Article 31 of the VCLT, implies that recourse to supplementary means (including the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* and the circumstances of the Treaty's conclusion) is only allowed in limited circumstances. Pursuant to Article 32 of the VCLT, one may resort to supplementary means of interpretation (i) to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 or (ii) to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31 \"leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure\" or \"leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable\".\n\n300.\n\nThe following supplementary means are noteworthy as they confirm the interpretation of the term *si\u00e8ge social* to which the Tribunal has arrived by application of Article 31.\n\n301.\n\nFirst, the unofficial English translation of the BLEU-Algeria BIT deposited by Belgium with the United Nations Treaty Series carries some weight, as it was submitted by one of the Contracting Parties to the BIT to the United Nations for purposes of publication in an important database of treaties. The English version submitted by Belgium translates *si\u00e8ge social* as registered office.323\n\nSee BIT, Exh. C-658, Art. 1(1)(b).\n\n302.\n\nSecond, the BLEU Model BIT, which is in English, likewise refers to registered office.324 Actually, Article 1(1)(b) of the BLEU-Algeria BIT faithfully reflects the BLEU Model BIT in that respect, as is also evidenced by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the BLEU-Algeria BIT (see below).\n\nSee BLEU Model-BIT, Exh. C-982, Art. 1(1)(b).\n\n303.\n\nThird, at least 26 BITs concluded by the BLEU, the official languages of which are both English and French, use *si\u00e8ge social* in French and registered office in English. In this respect, Algeria does not dispute that treaties on the same subject matter concluded by the Contracting Parties with third States may legitimately be considered as part of the supplementary means of interpretation, and rightly so.325 However, it contends that such treaty practice is inconclusive. While the Tribunal has noted that not all BITs concluded by the BLEU in both English and French translate *si\u00e8ge social* with registered office (for example, the BIT between the BLEU and the Philippines translates *si\u00e8ge social* with \"head office\"),326 the overwhelming majority of the BLEU BITs clearly indicates that the BLEU's understanding of *si\u00e8ge social* in its own BITs is that of registered office.327 Moreover, in many of those treaties, the English text prevails in the event of a discrepancy.328\n\nSee e.g. *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1996, paras. 29, 47; Case Concerning Rights of Nationals of the United States of America in Morocco, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1952, pp. 191-192; *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, para. 40; *Churchill*, paras. 195 *et seq*.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the other two BITs invoked by the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal in support of its conclusion that the BLEU BIT practice is not \"sufficiently conclusive\" were not concluded in French and English. See BLEU-Rwanda (1983) BIT and BLEU-Czech Republic BIT. Thus, the Tribunal does not consider these two BITs as helpful as those BITs in which English and French are both official languages.\n\nSee BLEU-Armenia BIT, C-728, Art. 1(1)(b), at 9; BLEU-Barbados BIT, Exh.

The Tribunal also notes that the BLEU-UAE and BLEU-Libya BITs show that when the BLEU wants to add different meanings, it does so expresslv. See BLEU-UAE BIT, Exh. C-729, Art. 1(b) (defining companv investors in the authentic English text as anv legal person constituted in accordance with law \"and having its registered office or place of management\" in Belgium, Luxembourg, or the UAE, and which the authentic French text translates as \" *si\u00e8ge social ou son si\u00e8ge de direction* \"); BLEU-Libva BIT, Exh. C-730, Art. 1(b) (defining companv investors in the authentic English text as anv legal person constituted in accordance with law \"and having its registered office and residence\" in Belgium, Luxembourg, or Libva, which the authentic French text translates as \" *si\u00e8ge social et son domicile* \").\n\n304.\n\nTo conclude on this point, interpreting *si\u00e8ge social* as *si\u00e8ge social statutaire* or registered office is fully in line with the BLEU's treaty practice. The Respondent was unable to convincingly refute this conclusion by pointing to a different treaty practice from either the BLEU or Algeria. A contrary conclusion would, in the Tribunal's view, entail extraordinary and far-reaching consequences, as it would directly contradict the formulations of the requirements *ratione personae* in dozens of treaties.\n\n305.\n\nThe Tribunal has next reviewed the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* which it requested from Belgium and Luxembourg, with the agreement of the Parties, and which were produced by Belgium. The *travaux* fully support the Tribunal's understanding.\n\n306.\n\nThe BLEU, represented by Belgium, and Algeria started BIT negotiations in 1980. The earliest draft of the BIT defined investors from Belgium and Luxembourg like in the final version.329 In fact, all later drafts proposed by Belgium contained the same definition of \"investor\".330 The first exchanges between the Parties in 1987 to 1989, in which Belgium rejected certain proposals from Algeria as \"for the most part, unacceptable\", were not concerned with the definition of investor.331 In November 1990, Belgium and Algeria held negotiation meetings and came to an agreement *ad referendum* \"on all of the provisions\", except for three issues, among which the definition of \"investors\". On this latter topic, Algeria undertook to engage in an exchange of letters.332\n\n*Travaux*, pp. 2-16.\n\n*Travaux*, pp. 76-93 (draft 1990) and pp. 106-124 (draft 1991).\n\n*Travaux*, pp. 46-48 and 50-53.\n\n*Travaux*, pp. 73-75 and 94\n\n307.\n\nOn 25 November 1990, Algeria proposed a draft exchange of letters that would be attached to the BIT and would define \"[n]ational investors or companies\" as \"those that have their principal center of economic interest in Belgium or Luxembourg [\" *centre principal de leurs int\u00e9r\u00eats economiques* \"], under the Algerian legislation in force concerning investments by nonresidents in Algeria\".333 On 21 February 1991, Belgium stated that it was ready to sign the BIT, provided Algeria \"abandons [its] amendment concerning the definition of investors\".334 On 25 February 1991, Algeria replied that the criterion of *si\u00e8ge social* was \"more vague than the principal center of economic activities\" and that the parties therefore needed to combine these criteria through an exchange of letters.335 On 19 March 1991, Belgium refused Algeria's proposal and reasoning. Belgium was concerned that Algeria would seek to \"exclude from the benefits of the Agreement multinational companies and to give advantages to the smallmedium companies (\u2018PME') (those which have their center of principal activities in the BLEU)\". Belgium proposed in consequence that each party define its respective investors on its own terms, with the BLEU \"considering as investors in Algeria the nationals and legal persons constituted in accordance with Belgian and Luxembourg legislation and having their *si\u00e8ge social* in the territory of the BLEU\", while Algeria \"could consider as investors in BLEU the physical and legal persons with their principal center of interests in Algeria\". In reply, Algeria proposed to reverse this approach, which led Belgium to note that the parties were at \"an impasse\".336\n\n*Travaux*, pp. 96-98 (Tribunal's translation. All translations of the *travaux* in this section are the Tribunal's free translations).\n\n*Travaux*, p. 125.\n\nSee *Travaux*, pp. 127-128.\n\n*Travaux*, pp. 139, 145-146.\n\n308.\n\nOn 17 April 1991, one week prior to the signature of the BIT, Belgium reiterated that its definition of investors was \"the classic model of the BLEU and provides classic guarantees in this field\", whereas \"[t]he Algerian proposal [\u2026] consists of excluding investments made in Algeria by physical or legal persons of the BLEU that do not have their \u2018principal center of economic interests' in Belgium or in Luxembourg\". Belgium regarded Algeria's proposal as \"unacceptable\", because it excluded from the BIT's protection \"investments that are made in Algeria\" by \"the numerous BLEU companies that realize the most important part of their activities abroad\" and \"the numerous BLEU companies that have capital held by shareholders of other countries\". It further observed that Algeria's proposal did \"not accord with international treaty practice\", as reflected in the ICJ's decision in *Barcelona Traction*. It also emphasized that, in the words of the Court, \"\u2018no absolute test of the \u2018genuine connection' has found general acceptance'\".337 Thereafter, Belgium stated \"that the notions of \u2018in accordance with the law of the country' and of \u2018 *si\u00e8ge social* ' are sufficient to define companies, and that all restrictions that are added are not inscribed in the accepted practice of the juridical community and are discriminatory towards our companies that exercise part of their activities abroad or whose capital is held by foreign shareholders\".338 There are no subsequent communications on record indicating any different position of the Parties on this matter, and in particular no expression of disagreement by Algeria.\n\n*Travaux*, pp. 143-144.\n\n*Travaux*, pp. 145-146.\n\n309.\n\nThe BIT was then signed on 24 April 1991. On 8 November 1995, the Belgian Government submitted the Explanatory Memorandum for purposes of ratifying the BIT to the Parliament.339 The Memorandum recounted that Algeria had proposed \"to exclude from the benefit of the treaty any investments made in Algeria by natural or juridical persons of the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union that did not have \u2018their principal center of economic interest in Belgium or in Luxembourg'\". However, \"[t]his proposal was unacceptable\", continues the Memorandum, and the BLEU was \"able to convince our Algerian partners to adopt our traditional formula for the definition of Investors and the content of the agreement thus concluded faithfully corresponds to our current practice\".340\n\nThe Explanatory Memorandum is of course not part of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* as it was not originated during the treaty's preparation phase, but was generated by one of the Parties several years thereafter during the ratification process. It is mentioned here to the extent that it is as an additional element that sheds light on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*.\n\nBelgian Senate, Explanatory Memorandum to the Belgium-Luxembourg - Algeria BIT, 8 November 1995, Exh. C-979, at 2.\n\n310.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the *travaux* show the following points. First, it does not transpire from the *travaux* that there was a discussion whether *si\u00e8ge social* meant registered office or *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el*. Second, it is clear that the BIT under negotiation was based on the BLEU's treaty practice and on the BLEU Model BIT, as was repeatedly stated by Belgium.341 Third, Algeria sought to add to the criteria of constitution and *si\u00e8ge social* a third requirement, namely the \"principal center of economic interest\" defined by reference to the average turnover of the company. Belgium firmly opposed this addition and insisted on its traditional formula based on constitution in accordance with law and *si\u00e8ge social*. It also dismissed Algeria's suggestion that *si\u00e8ge social* was a \"vague concept\" and instead argued that it had \"a firm legal value and is less susceptible of interpretation than the concept of \u2018principal center of economic activities'\" (\" *a une valeur juridique certaine et est d\u00e8s lors moins susceptible d'interpr\u00e9tation* \").342\n\nSee e.g. *Travaux*, p. 40.\n\n*Travaux*, p. 145.\n\n311.\n\nA passage from the *travaux* towards the very end of the negotiations is particularly enlightening to appreciate the BLEU's position, which was accepted by Algeria through the conclusion of the BIT:\n\n[\u2026] [the Algerian proposal to require a \"principal center of economic activities\" as part of the definition of \"investor\"] ne s'inscrit nullement dans la pratique conventionnelle internationale. Ainsi, l'arr\u00eat Barcelona Traction rendu \u00e0 l'encontre de la Belgique, le 05.02.70, par la Cour internationale de Justice stipule clairement (\u00a770) que \u00ab la r\u00e8gle traditionnelle attribue le droit d'exercer la protection diplomatique d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Etat sous les lois duquel elle s'est constitu\u00e9e et sur le territoire duquel elle a son si\u00e8ge \u00bb. Ces deux crit\u00e8res (repris dans notre projet) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9s par une longue pratique et par maint[s] instruments internationaux. Tout en constatant que certains Etats limitent quelque fois cette protection diplomatique lorsqu'il n'existe pas de lieu de \u00ab rattachement effectif \u00bb (p. ex. : absence d'organe de direction.) ce m\u00eame arr\u00eat poursuit cependant en soulignant qu' \u00ab aucun crit\u00e8re absolu applicable au lien effectif n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 \u00bb.343\n\n*Travaux*, p. 144. See also *Travaux*, pp. 145-146.\n\n312.\n\nTwo observations arise from this passage. First, Belgium was of the view that the dual condition of constitution and *si\u00e8ge social* was generally reflective of international treaty practice. In particular, Belgium equated its proposal of constitution in accordance with local law and *si\u00e8ge social* to \"the traditional rule\" articulated by the ICJ in *Barcelona Traction*, quoting the ICJ decision *verbatim*. It is worth recalling that, in the quoted French original paragraph, the Court spoke of constitution and *si\u00e8ge*, which it translated as \"registered office\".344 On this basis, Belgium confirmed that \"these two criteria [i.e., \"constitution in accordance with the law\" and \" *si\u00e8ge* \"] [were] reproduced in our draft\", which shows beyond any doubt that Belgium intended to adopt the first test enunciated in *Barcelona Traction* based on the place of incorporation (with the two usually associated components) and no other.345\n\nThe Tribunal notes that throughout the *Barcelona Traction* Judgment, the Court translated \" *si\u00e8ge* \" in the French version with \"registered office\" in the English version (see paras. 30, 31, 70, 71); \" *si\u00e8ge social* \" with \"seat (*si\u00e8ge social*)\" (para. 70); and \" *si\u00e8ge statutaire* \" with \"registered office\" (para. 71).\n\nThe position adopted by the BLEU during the negotiations of the BLEU-Algeria BIT is in turn confirmed by the BLEU Model BIT and the overwhelming majority of its BITs with third States (analyzed *supra* at paras. 301-303), which in their English versions refer to a company \"constituted in accordance with Belgian, Luxembourg or \\_\\_\\_ legislation and having its registered office in the territory of Belgium, Luxembourg or \\_\\_\", which, once more, faithfully reflects the English text of para. 70 of the ICJ judgment in *Barcelona Traction*.\n\n313.\n\nSecond, Belgium expressly objected to conditioning protection upon the existence of a \"genuine connection\" (\" *rattachement effectif* \") to the home State, such as the presence of a management body. This objection demonstrates that there is no basis for imposing a genuine or similar connection test under the BLEU-Algeria BIT. The express reference to the \"absence of a management body\" appears significant, as it shows that there is no room for a \"place of effective management\" or *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* test, which is the test the Respondent seeks to import into the meaning of *si\u00e8ge social*.\n\n**iii. Conclusion**\n-------------------\n\n314.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal considers that *\"si\u00e8ge social\u2019* in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT means \"registered office\" or *si\u00e8ge statutaire* in the sense of the \"seat\" appearing in a corporation's constitutive documents. Because there is no dispute that the Claimant was constituted in accordance with Luxembourg law and has its registered office in Luxembourg, the Tribunal concludes that it is an \"investor\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT.346\n\nTo the extent that the Respondent has also advanced and maintained a separate admissibility objection (see *supra* note 93), this objection is likewise rejected as the Claimant has fulfilled the conditions of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT at all relevant times.\n\n315.\n\nFinally, as already stated, a BIT criterion based on place of incorporation is an entirely reasonable criterion for the determination of nationality of juridical persons.347 Thus, in light of the conclusion reached above in respect of the interpretation of Article 1(1) of the BIT, the Claimant is also a \"national\" of a Contracting Party under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSee *supra* para. 267.\n\n***c.*** **Even if** ***si\u00e8ge social*** **were to refer to** ***si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el,*** **the Claimant would have its** ***si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el*** **in Luxembourg**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nEven if, contrary to the Tribunal's conclusion, *si\u00e8ge social* in Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT were to imply a reference to domestic nationality requirements and thus have the meaning of *si\u00e8ge social r\u00e9el*, the Claimant would equally be an \"investor\" under the BIT, as it would be a national of Luxembourg under the laws of Luxembourg. While the Tribunal would not need to address this point given its conclusion on the meaning of *si\u00e8ge social* in the BIT, it will nonetheless give brief reasons why a different interpretation of the term would not change the outcome of this jurisdictional objection.\n\n317.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, if it were to engage in an analysis of the nationality of the Claimant under the BIT by reference to domestic nationality requirements, the Tribunal would have to analyze whether the Claimant is a \"national\" of the relevant Contracting Party according to the criteria set by that Contracting Party to determine corporate nationality. Here, the Tribunal would thus apply the requirements for corporate nationality under Luxembourg law *as they are applied in Luxembourg*. As already explained above, the nationality of a company under Luxembourg law is determined by the *si\u00e8ge de l'administration centrale* of the company (formerly, *principal \u00e9tablissement*), as is stated in Articles 159 and 2 of the Luxembourg Company Law, which provide as follows:\n\n***Art. 159.***\n\n*(Loi du 25 ao\u00fbt 2006)*\n\n*\u00abToute soci\u00e9t\u00e9 dont*  ***l'administration centrale***  *est situ\u00e9e au Grand-Duch\u00e9, est soumise \u00e0 la loi luxembourgeoise, bien que l'acte constitutif ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 en pays \u00e9tranger.\u00bb*\n\n*(Loi du 31 mai 1999)*\n\n*\u00abLorsqu'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a son*  ***domicile***  *au Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg, elle est de*  ***nationalit\u00e9***  *luxembourgeoise et*  ***la loi luxembourgeoise lui est pleinement appliqu\u00e9e*** *.*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n***Art. 2.***  *:*\n\n*Le*  ***domicile***  *de toute soci\u00e9t\u00e9 commerciale est situ\u00e9 au*  ***si\u00e8ge de l'administration centrale***  *de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. L'administration centrale d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est*  ***pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e*** *, jusqu'\u00e0 preuve du contraire, co\u00efncider avec le lieu du*  ***si\u00e8ge statutaire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9*** *.348*\n\nLuxembourg Company law, Exh. RL-177 (emphasis added).\n\n318.\n\nWhile the place of the *administration centrale* determines the company's nationality, such place is, by virtue of Article 2(2) of the Company law, presumed to be at the *si\u00e8ge statutaire* or registered office. Under the presumption established by Luxembourg law, the Claimant would thus be a Luxembourgish national, as its *si\u00e8ge statutaire* is and has always been in Luxembourg.\n\n319.\n\nThe presumption encapsulated in Article 2(2) of the Luxembourg Company Law is, however, rebuttable. In this respect, the factors that Luxembourg law considers as relevant to determine where a company's *administration centrale* or *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* is located are rather formal in nature. The Tribunal notes that there is no major disagreement between the Parties' Luxembourg law experts on these factors (at least in the abstract). The Tribunal discerns the following relevant factors: whether (a) the general meetings of shareholders and the meetings of the Board of Managers take place in Luxembourg; (b) the corporate and accounting records are maintained in Luxembourg; (c) administrative services are provided in Luxembourg; and (d) the company's correspondence is generally addressed to and sent from Luxembourg.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal considered similar criteria and found that the \"elements indicative of the presence of an effective seat\" in Luxembourg included the following elements: \"the places where the Directors meet; the place where the Shareholders meet; and the place where the books and records of the company are being kept\".349 In assessing whether the claimant in that case had an \"effective seat\" in Luxembourg, the tribunal also \"consider[ed] it critical to take into account the actual nature of each company, and its actual activities\".350 In particular, the tribunal noted that:\n\nIn so far as [such] entity is no more than a holding company, or a company with little or no day-to-day operational activities, its day-to-day \u2018management' will necessarily be very limited, and so will its physical links with its corporate seat. Put another way, it would be entirely unreasonable to expect a mere holding company, or a company with little or no operational responsibility, to maintain extensive offices or workforce, or to be able to provide evidence of extensive activities, at its corporate location. And yet holding companies, and companies with little or no operational responsibility, have \u2018management', and are certainly not excluded from the [BIT] in this case. Indeed, countries such as Luxembourg [\u2026] clearly consider it to their respective benefit to attract such companies, and to maintain a corporate regulatory regime that allows for them.351\n\n*Tenaris and Talta*, para. 176.\n\n*Tenaris and Talta*, para. 197.\n\n*Tenaris and Talta*, para. 199.\n\n321.\n\nThe *Tenaris and Talta* tribunal concluded on this point that \"the test of actual or effective management must be a flexible one, which takes into account the precise nature of the company in question and its actual activities\".352 By contrast, the tribunal also dismissed any relevance of other criteria advanced by Venezuela to argue that the company's real seat was elsewhere. In particular, it held that, in accordance with Luxembourg law, neither the \"nationality and residence of senior management\" nor the \"number and location of any employees of a company\" constitute valid criteria to assess the effective seat353 and that \"Tenaris does have a physical presence in Luxembourg\" even though \"under Luxembourg law, there is no need for a company to own or rent premises in Luxembourg\".354\n\n*Tenaris and Talta*, para. 200.\n\n*Tenaris and Talta*, paras. 218-219.\n\n*Tenaris and Talta*, para. 221.\n\n322.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, applying the relevant criteria under Luxembourg law, as enumerated in the preceding paragraphs, there can be no doubt that the Claimant fulfills all of these criteria. First, all of the Claimant's general meetings of shareholders and meetings of the Board of Managers were held in Luxembourg. Second, the Claimant's corporate and accounting records are maintained at its registered office in Luxembourg. Third, from its inception, all of the Claimant's administrative services, including book-keeping and accounting, were provided in Luxembourg. Fourth, the Claimant's correspondence was generallv sent to and from Luxembourg. The Respondent's objections to the wavs those meeting were held (i.e. bv proxv, through teleconference or circular resolution) are unfounded as those practices are allowed under Luxembourg law (and the Claimant's Articles of Association). Moreover, the Respondent's insistence on Mr. Sawiris rare appearances in Luxembourg or on his overall role in the companv are misplaced as these facts plav no role to establish a companv's *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* in Luxembourg. Furthermore, like Tenaris, OTMTI is a holding companv and \"has no operational activities of its own and its onlv function is to manage its portfolio of companies\", which would necessarilv require \"relativelv limited\" management activitv.355 Thus, considering all of these circumstances, there can be no doubt that the Claimant has its *administration centrale* or place of effective management or *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* in Luxembourg. The Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not been able to establish otherwise.\n\n*Tenaris and Talta*, paras. 204-205.\n\n323.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the Tribunal were to engage in an analysis as to whether, under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT, the Claimant has its *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* in Luxembourg (which would not be justified under the BIT), the Claimant would nonetheless fulfil the definition of \"investor\" of the BIT.\n\n324.\n\nThe foregoing analysis on the theoretical interpretation of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT as well as the subsidiary analysis of the concrete existence of a *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* is that of the Tribunal's majority. Arbitrator Stern is not in agreement with these analyses.356\n\nArbitrator Stern considers that *si\u00e8ge social* as referred to in the BIT can only mean *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el*, if interpreted, as it should be according to the *Barcelona Traction* case (para. 50), by reference to the rules generally accepted by municipal laws. Moreover, for her, this case is a *cas d'\u00e9cole* where the *si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el* does not coincide with the registered seat in the Netherlands and must be considered to be in Egypt, because M. Sawiris himself, an Egyptian national, insisted that he is \"everything\" in the corporate structure.\n\n**C. JURISDICTION** ***RATIONE MATERIAE*****: WHETHER THE CLAIMANT MADE AN INVESTMENT WITHIN THEMEANING OF THE BIT AND THE ICSID CONVENTION**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant made no investment within the meaning of the BIT (a) and the ICSID Convention (b). The Respondent further objects that the alleged contracts concluded between OTA and MedCable are not investments of the Claimant (c).\n\na. **The Claimant made no investment within the meaning of the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nWhile the Respondent concedes that *OTH* made an investment in Algeria,357 the Respondent objects that the *Claimant* made no investment in the economy and on the territory of Algeria pursuant to the BIT. The Respondent has advanced a number of arguments in this respect.\n\nSee Tr. Day 5 (Respondent's Closing), 134:21-134:23 (\"[...] OTH did carry out an initial Investment; there's no dispute on that\") and Tr. Day 1 (Respondent's Opening), 103:10-103:12 (\"We are not saying that the former Investors didn't Invest... The Investment Is still there from OTH\"). See also R-PHB 2, para. 78 *(\"Il n\u2019est pas* *contest\u00e9 par les Parties que, au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 2000, M. Naguib Sawiris et sa famille ont r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par le biais de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 OTH un investissement sur le territoire alg\u00e9rien au nom et pour le compte de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 OTA,* *prenant la forme de l'acquisition de la Licence GSM (et de la conclusion de la Convention d'Investissement)* \", (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n327.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, for the Respondent the mere holding of an indirect shareholding in OTA does not constitute an investment in the local economy or on the territory of Algeria pursuant to the BIT.358 Because the Treaty's purpose, like that of any BIT, is to encourage investments on the territory of the Contracting Parties, an investor must establish that it has invested in the economy and on the territory of one of the Contracting Parties or at least establish a \"territorial nexus\" with that Contracting Party.359\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 177-180; Reply, paras. 226-230; R-PHB 1, para. 97.\n\nReply, para. 227.\n\n328.\n\nFor the Respondent, this means that when an investment is made in an indirect manner, the indirect investor must prove that it has effected the investment through one or more vehicles *established for the purposes of the investment*.360 Here, the Claimant has made no investments or re-investments, whether at the time of acquiring Wind or thereafter. OTMTI became an indirect shareholder in OTH to finance the acquisition of Wind, not to invest in Algeria.361 More specifically, the Respondent's argument is that the pledge of the OTH shares in the context of the Wind acquisition allowed Mr. Sawiris to obtain part of the funds necessary to acquire the Italian company through two \"collateral loans\" concluded with Weather Capital on 5 August 2005 for a total amount of \u20ac1.2 billion.\n\nReply, para. 228; R-PHB 1, para. 96.\n\nReply, paras. 234-240; R-PHB 1, paras. 98-100.\n\n329.\n\nAlgeria further submits that, even after the Wind acquisition, the Claimant made no investments under the BIT.362First, contrary to the Claimant's allegations, the share purchases of Weather Investments in December 2006 and January 2007 are not investments. In particular, the purchase from Enel of 26.1% of Weather Investments shares is the result of the sale of Wind, and was thus not made with a view to investing in the Algerian economy.363 Furthermore, the purchase of 0.62% of Weather Investments shares from certain Middle Eastern investors does not constitute an investment either. In fact, these acquisitions were made within the context of the Wind acquisition, and present no links with Algeria,364 which is the reason why the Claimant has refused to produce the related purchase agreements.\n\nReply, paras. 241; R-PHB 1, paras. 101-110.\n\nReply, paras. 242-244; R-PHB 1, para. 102.\n\nReply, paras. 245-248; R-PHB 1, para. 103.\n\n330.\n\nSecond, the Respondent rebuts the Claimant's argument that it made a contribution \"in services\" to OTA through the French subsidiary Orascom Telecom Services Europe (\"OTSE\") and through Weather Investments.365 For the Respondent, the alleged services performed by OTSE are grounded solely on statements from one of the Claimant's witnesses (Mr. Michel Hubert) and on one exhibit,366 which is an incomplete document lacking any evidentiary value.367 With regard to the alleged services rendered by Weather Investments between 2006 and 2010 (the Claimant's argument being that the Claimant made a payment of \u20ac2.48 million to Weather Investments, which in turn provided services to its subsidiaries, including OTA), the Respondent notes that the Claimant's annual reports do not specify the purpose of those payments. The Claimant has thus not established that such payments were intended to finance Weather Investments' services to OTA.368\n\nReply, paras. 249-260, R-PHB 1, para. 105.\n\nOTSE Service Detail, 2006-2008, Exh. C-845.\n\nReply, paras. 251-257; R-PHB 1, para. 105.\n\nReply, paras. 258-260; R-PHB 1, para. 105.\n\n331.\n\nThird, the Claimant has not shown that it made any \"reinvestments\" within OTA pursuant to the BIT.369 In this respect, the Respondent contends that OTA's earnings were not reinvested in the local economy and on Algerian territory. The Respondent points to the minutes of the shareholders meeting of OTA, which allegedly confirm that OTA's shareholders voted for the distribution of almost all of OTA's returns as dividends.370 Further, the minutes of the meetings of the Claimant's corporate organs do not evidence any decision to reinvest dividends in OTA.371 In addition, the Claimant cannot rely on the expenses incurred by OTA (\" *d\u00e9penses effectu\u00e9es par OTA* \"), as these expenses were necessary for OTA to operate and make profits and are therefore not dividends which shareholders would have left in the company.372\n\nReply, paras. 261-285; R-PHB 1, paras. 106-109.\n\nReply, para. 265; R-PHB 1, para. 107; R-PHB 2, para. 90.\n\nReply, para. 266.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 108; R-PHB 2, para. 90.\n\n332.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant has not established that it exercised any effective control over OTA. The Respondent contends that under Luxembourg law, if the Claimant had exercised effective control, it should have filed consolidated annual accounts starting from 2005, which it did not do.373 The consolidated accounts drawn up from 2009 to 2011 were merely an attempt to manufacture control *ex post* for purposes of this arbitration.374 Finally, the Claimant has not proven that it has taken any decision relating to OTA's activity in Algeria, as the minutes of its meetings contain no reference to OTA or to disputes between OTA (or OTH) and the Algerian authorities.375\n\nReply, paras. 269-278.\n\nReply, para. 279; R-PHB 1, para. 109.\n\nReply, paras. 280-284; R-PHB 1, para. 109.\n\n**b. The Claimant made no investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimant must show that it has made an \"investment\" under the objective definition developed in the framework of the ICSID Convention. Such definition provides for three elements: a contribution made for a certain duration at a risk.376 The Respondent underscores that the Claimant does not dispute that an investment in the sense of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention necessarily entails a contribution or \"commitment of resources\".377\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 206-213; Reply, paras. 286-287.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 113, referring to the Claimant's Opening Statement, Tr. Day 1, 141:19-21.\n\n334.\n\nAs a general matter, the Respondent submits that the mere holding of shares in a company does not involve a contribution pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. For these to be a contribution, the shareholder must have committed resources when purchasing the shares (or thereafter). It cannot benefit from a possible contribution made previously by the seller *(\u2018l\u2019actionnaire... ne peut simplement se pr\u00e9valoir d\u2019une \u00e9ventuelle contribution effectu\u00e9e auparavant par le c\u00e9dant* \").378 Moreover, the shareholder's contribution must be \"substantial\" and effected on the host state's territory or, at least, \"with a view to and within the framework of the project to be realized abroad\" (\" *en vue et dans le cadre du projet \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger\"*).379\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 114; R-PHB 2, para. 73.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 73.\n\n335.\n\nThe thrust of the Respondent's argument is that the Claimant has made no contribution on Algerian territory, as the *raison d\u2019\u00eatre* of its alleged payments was to acquire an Italian company (through a variety of investment vehicles), not to invest in Algeria.380 More particularly, the Respondent makes the following observations in relation to each of the Claimant's alleged \"commitments of resources\".\n\nReply, para. 290.\n\n336.\n\nFirst, in connection with the Claimant's August 2005 issue of shares for a total value of \u20ac3.5 billion, such issue cannot be regarded as a contribution, as its purpose was not to buy a (very indirect) interest in OTA, but to fulfil a condition precedent (\" *condition suspensive* \") for the acquisition of Wind:381\n\na. The issue of the shares constituted the last step in the restructuring of the Sawiris family's shareholding in OTH effected for the purposes of the Wind acquisition.382 The transaction involved a mere \"paper exchange\" (the Sawiris Entities subscribed the entirety of the new shares issued by the Claimant in exchange of the shares they held in Weather Investments), as was admitted by the Claimant's financial expert, Mr. Tolkien, at the Hearing.383\n\nb. Such restructuring was economically neutral vis-\u00e0-vis OTA and Algeria.384 It did not entail any cash flow in the direction or for the benefit of Algeria. Once again, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant's financial expert conceded as much at the Hearing.385 It also argues that the Claimant's invocation of *Gold Reserve* is misplaced as the latter considered the share swap under the applicable BIT, not under the ICSID Convention.386\n\nc. The financing obtained in the context of the restructuring was neutral vis-\u00e0-vis Algeria: the \"subordinated loan agreement\" entered into by Mr. Sawiris was a mere accounting exercise (\" *jeu d'\u00e9critures* \") without economic substance.387 The \"collateral loans\" granted by Banca IMI in the amount of \u20ac1.2 billion were used by Weather Investments to finance the acquisition of a 62.75% stake in Wind from Enel on 11 August 2005, and not to invest in Algeria.388\n\nReply, paras. 294-301; R-PHB 1, paras. 119-134; R-PHB 2, paras. 75-84.\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 120-124.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 82.\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 125-133.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 82.\n\nR-PHB 1, fn. 317; R-PHB 2, fn. 153.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 131.\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 132-133.\n\n337.\n\nSecond, in connection with the contribution in cash of \u20ac294 million allegedly made by the Claimant to Weather Investments, the Respondent observes that such payment was a condition to obtain the collateral loans for the Wind acquisition.389 Also that contribution was thus used to finance the acquisition of 62.75% of the shares in Wind. Therefore, it cannot be deemed a contribution in Algeria under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.390\n\nReply, paras. 302-306.\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 136-137; R-PHB 2, para. 85.\n\n338.\n\nThird, the December 2006/January 2007 payments of \u20ac1.3 billion to purchase Weather Investments shares from Enel and the Middle Eastern investors are no contribution either, as their purpose was to complete the acquisition of Wind and not to acquire a new indirect interest in OTH.391 In addition, the purchase of shares from Enel was financed by third parties and not by the Claimant, and it is not proven that the purchase of shares from the Middle Eastern investors was financed by the Claimant.392\n\nReply, paras. 310-318; R-PHB 1, paras. 139-141; R-PHB 2, para. 86.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 86.\n\n339.\n\nFourth, the other alleged contributions do not qualify as such under Article 25:393\n\na. For the reasons already explained above,394 OTA's alleged reinvestments cannot be considered contributions.\n\nb. The services rendered by Weather Investments, by OTSE and by persons empowered by the Claimant are no contributions either.395\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 142-144.\n\nSee *supra* para. 331.\n\nSee *supra* para. 330.\n\n340.\n\nFifth, the Respondent disputes that the inclusion of OTA in a \"stronger group\" following the restructuring may constitute a contribution, as the Claimant argues.396 This argument is unfounded legally and factually, as the acquisition of Wind entailed a \"negative contribution\" towards Algeria.397 The various companies created in the framework of the transaction were deeply indebted,398 which cannot give rise to a contribution.399\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 145, discussing Claimant's Closing Statement, especially Tr. Day 5, 187:4-9 (\"Mr. Nasr in fact confirms this, confirmed the value of the contribution by Claimant to OTA.

In support, it calls attention to the decision of the High Court of Justice of London mentioning that the Sawiris \"were able to obtain control of Wind through [Weather Investments] with a minimum of cash\" and to a statement by Mr. Sawiris that he acquired Wind \"for free\".400\n\nReply, paras. 327-328, referring to the Decision of the High Court of Justice (Chancery Division) of London, 15 June 2009, [2009] EWHC 1330 (Ch), Exh.

(\"MedCable\"), do not fall within the definition of investment under Article 1(2) of the BIT (which applies to companies incorporated in the host state).401 As a result, so says Algeria, the Claimant has changed its argument and now invokes certain purported contracts between MedCable and OTA as assets of OTA (\" *un actif d\u2019OTA* \").\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 170-172; Reply, para. 214.\n\n343.\n\nTo this changed argument, the Respondent objects that the existence and entry into effect of these contracts is not proven:402\n\na. First, the so-called \"Capacity Agreement IN\",403 a service agreement between OTA and MedCable of 17 December 2007, provides that it will become effective on the date of conclusion of several so-called \"Capacity Agreements OUT\".404 Since the Claimant has only produced one Capacity Agreement OUT,405 the Respondent requests that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences against the Claimant.406 Further, the Capacity Agreement OUT produced by the Claimant is to become effective on the conclusion of a so-called \"BF Lease Agreement\". This lease, produced with the Rejoinder,407 was itself to become effective on the conclusion of a Consortium Agreement between MedCable and the \" *Consortium Alg\u00e9rien de T\u00e9l\u00e9communications* \". However, the Consortium Agreement produced by the Claimant408 was concluded between MedCable and OTA, not the *Consortium Alg\u00e9rien de T\u00e9l\u00e9communications*. Therefore, so the Respondent concludes, it is not established that the Capacity Agreement IN, as well as the related agreements, have entered into force.409\n\nb. Second, according to the Respondent, the Claimant has attempted to establish the \"right-of-use\" or \"IRU\" over the cable (on which it relies in its briefs) only by reference to the Mason expert report and to a short excerpt from an internal power point presentation of OTA,410 which documents are devoid of evidentiary value.411 The Claimant has not produced the contract(s) providing for such right of use.412 The Respondent thus requests that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences from the absence of these contracts.413\n\nReply, paras. 216-218.\n\nMed Cable - Algerian Cable Term Sheet of the Capacity Lease Agreement In (Traffic Originating Outside of Algeria) between MedCable Ltd. and OTA, dated 17 December 2007, Exh.

The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that it made an investment that qualifies for protection under both the BIT (a) and the ICSID Convention (b). Specifically, the Claimant contends that OTMTI paid \u20ac5.1 billion in cash and shares to acquire Weather Investments and with it, *inter alia*, its indirect investment in OTA. The corporate restructuring of the Weather Group that enabled this acquisition greatly benefited OTA, given the contributions in management, know-how, procurement, and increased access to capital. In addition, the Claimant contends that OTA's reinvestment of \u20ac1.2 billion in earnings into Algeria after the Claimant gained control over the company constitutes a further investment.\n\na. **The Claimant made an investment within the meaning of the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that it has made an investment within the meaning of the BIT. First, it submits that under the express terms of the BIT, an indirect shareholding in an Algerian company constitutes an investment.417 The Respondent's argument that the indirect holding of shares in OTA does not constitute an investment in the local economy or in the territory of Algeria is contrary to the clear definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(2) of the BIT,418 which reads as follows:\n\nThe term \u2018investments' shall mean any kind of assets or any direct or indirect contribution in cash, in kind or in services, invested or reinvested in any sector of economic activity whatsoever.\n\nThe following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be considered as investments for the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n[\u2026]\n\nb) Shares, company shares, and any other form of participation, including minority or indirect participation, in companies constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party; [\u2026]419\n\nRejoinder, paras. 206-211.\n\nRejoinder, para. 206.\n\nBLEU-Algeria BIT, Exh. C-658, Article 1(2).\n\n348.\n\nFor the Claimant, OTMTI's payment of \u20ac5.1 billion in cash and shares to acquire, *inter alia,* its indirect investment in OTA falls within the broad language of the chapeau.420 Furthermore, OTA is a \"compan[y] constituted in the territory of\" Algeria and OTMTI acquired an \"indirect\" participation for cash and shares, which comes within the assets mentioned in Article 1(2)(b).421\n\nRejoinder, para. 207.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 65; Rejoinder, para. 207.\n\n349.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that the BIT does not protect the passive holding of an indirect participation. The BIT does not require \"active\" involvement and protects \"minority or indirect\" shareholding.422 The Claimant also underscores that, even in the absence of an express mention of indirect shareholdings, tribunals have consistently held that indirect investments are protected under the applicable treaty.423 Similarly, the acquisition of an indirect interest after the initial contribution into the host state constitutes an investment entitled to BIT protection.424\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 76-77.\n\nRejoinder, para. 208.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 74-75, discussing *Teco Guatemala Holdings LLC v.

The Plurinational State of Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2011-17, UNCITRAL, Award, 31 January 2014, Exh. CLA-169.\n\n350.\n\nThe Claimant also discards the Respondent's argument that it has made no investment on the territory of Algeria within the meaning of the BIT as contrary to the express treaty terms.425 This argument would defeat the Treaty's express references to \"indirect\" contributions, \"indirect\" investments, reinvestments, and \"indirect\" shareholdings.426 Numerous tribunals have confirmed that a shareholding in a company that is active in the host state constitutes a protected investment, irrespective of whether funds financing the local operations flow into the host state or not.427\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 71-72.\n\nRejoinder, para. 209.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 72.\n\n351.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's overarching focus on the reasons for which the Claimant acquired its indirect shareholding in OTA is misguided, as subjective intent and motivation are not germane to determining whether the Claimant made an investment under the BIT.428 It is for the Tribunal to assess objectively whether an investment was made, and no tribunal has ever held that a claimant's motivation is relevant to determine whether an investment exists.429\n\nRejoinder, paras. 212-215; C-PHB 1, para. 120.\n\nRejoinder, para. 213.\n\n352.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant alleges that in acquiring Weather Investments' shares, OTMTI meant to bring Weather Investments' assets, including OTA, under OTMTI's ownership and control.430\n\nRejoinder, para. 215.\n\n353.\n\nAs is further explained below when discussing the Claimant's alleged contributions under the meaning of the ICSID Convention, the Claimant contends that it paid \u20ac3,794 billion in cash and shares in 2005 to acquire an indirect controlling participation in OTA.431 The Claimant acknowledges that \"it acquired its indirect controlling shareholding in OTA in the context of subsequently acquiring an indirect controlling shareholding in Wind Italy and that it used shares of OTH as collateral to acquire Wind Italy\".432 However, it asserts that there can be no dispute that it made an \"investment\" within the meaning of the BIT, when in August 2005 the Sawiris Entities transferred their shares in Weather Investments to the Claimant, in return for shares in OTMTI, for a total of \u20ac3.5 billion. OTMTI further contributed an amount of approximately \u20ac294 million to Weather Investments to subscribe an increase in the capital of Weather Investments through cash contributions.433 The Claimant stresses that its bank records confirm that it paid Weather Investments \u20ac294 million in cash to buy shares in Weather Investments.434\n\nRejoinder, paras. 216-217.\n\nRejoinder, para. 216.\n\nRejoinder, para. 217.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 54 and 217, referring to Banca IMI, Weather II Regular Account Statement, 5 April 2006, Exh.

For the Claimant, its acquisition of additional shareholding in OTA through a purchase of further shares in Weather Investments was an investment within the meaning of the BIT.436\n\nRejoinder, paras. 218-220; C-PHB 1, para. 111 (discussing the 2006 purchase of shares of Weather Investments from Enel, for which the Claimant alleges to have paid \u20ac248 million in cash to Enel; the loan in the amount of \u20ac962 million from Enel (repaid with interest totaling \u20ac1,025 billion in June 2008) and the \u20ac44.47 paid to certain Middle Eastern shareholders).\n\nRejoinder, paras. 218-219.\n\n355.\n\nThird, to counter the Respondent's argument that the property, contractual rights, and interests attached to the company OTA do not amount to an investment by the Claimant under the BIT, the Claimant submits that the BIT protection extends to both the ownership of the shares and of the assets of OTA.437 For the Claimant, any assets and contracts of OTA fall within the specific definition of investment in the BIT (which includes a broad chapeau). Thus, the property and contractual rights of OTA are covered by the protection which the BIT affords to the Claimant.438 Tribunals routinely find that a claimant with a controlling shareholding has standing to make claims for acts prejudicial to \"the contractual rights of the company of which it was a shareholder\",439 and that the assets and the contractual rights of the company in the host state controlled by the claimant are protected \"investments\" for purposes of the treaty.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 221-225.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 68-70; Rejoinder, para. 223.\n\nRejoinder, para. 224, citing to *Pan American Energy LLC, and BP Argentina Exploration Company v.

CLA-155, paras. 111-15.\n\n356.\n\nThe Claimant specifies that it does not claim that the Tribunal has jurisdiction on the basis of its ownership of shares in MedCable. Rather, OTMTI's investment under the BIT is its indirect shareholding in OTA, as well as its ownership interest in OTA's rights and assets.440 OTA leased and later purchased from MedCable the rights to use a submarine cable from Algiers and Annaba in Algeria to Marseilles in France under the Mediterranean Sea (the cable itself is also referred to as MedCable). Hence, OTA's right to use that submarine cable, pursuant to lease agreements with OTH's wholly-owned subsidiary, MedCable, falls within the BIT definition of \"investments\".441 According to the Claimant, OTA perfected its lease agreements with MedCable on 17 December 2007. As these contracts were not covered by the Respondent's document production request, any adverse inferences sought by the Respondent in this respect should be denied.442\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 78.\n\nRejoinder, para. 222.\n\nRejoinder, para. 225.\n\n357.\n\nIn any event, with its Rejoinder, the Claimant submitted the BF Lease Agreement, upon which the entry into force of the Capacity OUT Lease Agreement was contingent, as well as a Consortium Agreement, which conditioned the entry into force of the BF Lease Agreement.443 Hence, the Claimant submits that the Capacity IN Lease Agreement and the Capacity OUT Lease Agreement became effective when OTA signed these agreements on 17 December 2007.444\n\nSee Rejoinder, paras. 75-76, discussing Med Cable - Algerian Cable Term Sheet of the Black Fibre Lease Agreement between OTA and Consortium Alg\u00e9rien de T\u00e9l\u00e9communications S.p.A., 19 October 2006, Exh.

Where such control exists, there is no need to look for indicia of effective control.447 While certain arbitral tribunals may have considered other elements to determine effective control over an entity *in the absence of a controlling share ownership*, those cases are not relevant in the present circumstances, as the Claimant held an indirect controlling shareholding in OTA.448\n\nRejoinder, para. 228.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 229-230, discussing *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v.

CLA-142.\n\n360.\n\nIn addition, in respect of the Respondent\u2019s objection that the minutes of the OTMTI Board do not discuss OTA, the Claimant emphasizes that Weather Investments served as the operative entity for the Weather Group affiliates, including OTA, and that the Claimant routinely exercised its authority to appoint the members of the Weather Investments Board.449 Discussions concerning business matters of the Weather Group appear in the minutes of the shareholder and Board of Managers meetings and in the financial reports of Weather Investments, rather than of the Claimant, with the Claimant controlling these decisions through its control over Weather Investments.450\n\nRejoinder, para. 231.\n\nRejoinder, para. 231.\n\n**b. The Claimant made an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that its investment in OTA constitutes an \"investment\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.451First, the Claimant\u2019s shareholding in OTA, which qualifies as an investment under the BIT, also constitutes an investment under the ICSID Convention.452 In light of the absence of a definition of investment in the ICSID Convention, a tribunal should look to the definition of \"investment\" in the BIT.453 As OTMTI's indirect shareholding in OTA constitutes an \"investment\" under the BIT, it also meets the requirement of an \"investment\" pursuant to the ICSID Convention.454 Tribunals have generally recognized that the *Salini* criteria should be treated as non-binding, non-exclusive means of identifying (rather than defining) an investment under the ICSID Convention.455 A tribunal would need strong reasons to disregard the contracting states' definition of investment in a BIT.456 Because the definition of \"investment\" in the BLEU-Algeria BIT is consistent with an understanding showed by numerous other states, there can be no doubt that OTMTI's investment qualifies under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.457\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 80-96.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 80-83.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 80.

CLA-137.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 83.\n\n362.\n\nSecond, even if the Tribunal were minded to consider the *Salini* criteria in determining the existence of an investment pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, OTMTI's investment in OTA would clearly fulfill these criteria as identified by Algeria, namely a contribution, a duration, and a certain risk.\n\n363.\n\nThe Claimant notes that there is no dispute about *duration.* Indeed, Algeria does not challenge that requirement, nor could it, as OTMTI held its indirect shareholding in OTA for nearly six years.458\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 90.\n\n364.\n\nWith respect to *contribution,* the Claimant alleges that it made substantial contributions in cash, assets, services, know-how, and personnel in establishing and furthering its investment in Algeria:459\n\n\u2022 As a first element of contribution, the Claimant made the following five contributions in the aggregate amount of approximately \u20ac5.1 billion in cash and shares to acquire, *inter alia*, its indirect shareholding in OTA:460\n\ni. In August 2005, the Claimant contributed \u20ac3.5 billion in shares to acquire Weather Investments and, thereby, an indirect shareholding in OTA. For the Claimant a contribution towards an investment may be made by issuing shares.461\n\nii. Still, in August 2005, the Claimant paid \u20ac294 million in cash to acquire additional Weather Investments shares. The Claimant's bank records evidence this payment462 and the fact that the Claimant borrowed this amount is irrelevant, as the commitment of borrowed capital may constitute a contribution.\n\niii. In 2006, the Claimant paid \u20ac248 million in cash to acquire additional Weather Investments shares from Enel.\n\niv. In June 2008, the Claimant paid \u20ac1,025 billion in cash to acquire additional Weather Investments shares, by repaying with interest a loan amounting to \u20ac962 million previously taken from Enel.\n\nv. The Claimant further made a \u20ac44.47 million cash payment to Middle Eastern investors to buy more Weather Investments shares, thereby acquiring additional indirect participation in OTA.\n\n\u2022 For the Claimant, the evidence refutes the Respondent's characterization of the Claimant's acquisition of OTA as a mere \"paper share exchange\", implying a lack of value.463 The value of the Claimant's shares that were tendered for Weather Investments' shares (and thus for indirect holding in OTH and OTA) was commensurate with the market value of OTH at the time, which amounted to US$ 42 per share.464 The \"Claimant paid an amount equivalent to this fair market value when, as part of the restructuring of the Weather Group, it engaged in a share-for-share exchange through which the Sawiris family tendered OTH shares for Weather Investments shares and then Weather Investments shares for [the] Claimant's shares\".465 The shares that the Claimant contributed are assets and a contribution may take any form, including assets.466 In support, the Claimant invokes *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela*, a case in which the tribunal upheld jurisdiction where the Canadian claimant had acquired indirect ownership in a Venezuelan subsidiary through a restructuring involving a share-to-share swap with no funds being exchanged in or moving through Venezuela.467 An investment may be made in the host state without a direct transfer of funds there, particularly if the transaction accrues to the benefit of the state itself. In fact, requiring a direct flow of funds into the host state would preclude a foreign investor from purchasing an existing investment from another foreign investor.468\n\n\u2022 Moreover, the fact that the Weather Group assumed debt and that the OTH shares were used as security in connection with the Wind transaction lacks relevance, as debt and borrowed funds can be used to finance an investment without undermining the existence of a contribution.469\n\n\u2022 As a second element, the Claimant contributed over US$ 1.2 billion through reinvested OTA earnings between 2005 and 2010, when the Claimant was OTA's indirect controlling shareholder.470 It cites to its expert Mr. Tolkien who stated that \"[d]eclaring and paying dividends after investments in assets have already been made does not alter the fact that retained earnings were already being reinvested\".471 Further referring to *OI European v. Venezuela*, the Claimant asserts that a shareholder who does not collect the profits of its company does make a monetary contribution to the company.472\n\n\u2022 As a third element of contribution, the Claimant paid \u20ac2.48 million out-of-pocket to Weather Investments between 2006 and 2010 and Weather Investments provided financial assistance to the Weather Group companies, including OTA.473\n\n\u2022 As a fourth element, the Claimant also indirectly contributed services to OTA through Weather Investments and OTSE. It is well established that the provision of a service constitutes a contribution for the purposes of ascertaining the existence of an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention.474\n\n\u2022 As a fifth and final element, the Claimant contributed personnel and know-how to the development of OTA's market leadership in Algeria's telecommunications sector, in particular through Mr. Sawiris.475 The Claimant alleges that it contributed to OTA's improved creditworthiness, access to international capital markets, significant procurement savings and efficiencies, and inter-affiliate services and know-how, all of which were made available as a result of the Claimant's restructuring of the Weather Group.476\n\n\u2022 In this context, the Claimant adds that the argument of a negative contribution is ill-conceived. By acquiring Wind and restructuring the Weather Group, OTMTI gained a foothold in developed as well as emerging markets when it became OTA's controlling shareholder, as a result of which OTA received the benefits of the Weather Group's synergies and market expansion, including know-how, efficient managerial resource allocation, increased access to capital, procurement advantages, and services.477 Among these, the Claimant in particular stresses the provision of direct and indirect management expertise to OTA;478 financing benefits (e.g., enhanced creditworthiness and borrowing power for OTA, access to top-tier banks and international capital markets);479 and procurement savings (through the Claimant's networks of equipment providers and bargaining power).480\n\nRejoinder, paras. 237-243.\n\nRejoinder, para. 239.\n\nRejoinder, para. 239.\n\nBanca IMI, Weather II Regular Account Statement, 5 April 2006, Exh.

Bolivia* into a new subjective factor for its \"objective\" test for an investment.483 No tribunal has ever held that the claimant\u2019s subjective intent or motivation is relevant to assess the existence of an investment.484 In any event, the evidence shows that OTMTI\u2019s motivation in acquiring Weather Investments shares precisely included placing its assets, most notably OTA, under OTMTI\u2019s ownership and control.485\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 94.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 95; C-PHB 1, para. 120.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 96.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n367.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal examines whether the Claimant made an investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT. To this end, the Tribunal will first set out the articulation between the definitions of investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and under the BIT (a). Thereafter, the Tribunal will assess whether the Claimant made any investments that meet those definitions (b).\n\na. **Articulation between the definitions of investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and in the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention circumscribes the jurisdiction of the Centre as follows:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. [\u2026]\n\n369.\n\nArticle 9 of the BIT, entitled \"Settlement of investment disputes\", limits the Contracting Parties' consent to investor-state arbitration to \"any *investment* dispute\".486 The definition of the term investment is found in Article 1 of the BIT, which in pertinent part reads as follows:\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n2. The term \"investments\" shall mean any kind of assets or any direct or indirect contribution in cash, in kind or in services, invested or reinvested in any sector of economic activity whatsoever.\n\nThe following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be considered as investments for the purposes of this Agreement:\n\n(a) Movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem, such as mortgages, liens, pledges, usufructs and similar rights;\n\n(b) Shares, company shares, and any other form of participation, including minority or indirect participation, in companies constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party;\n\n(c) Bonds, claims and rights to any benefit having an economic value;\n\n(d) Copyrights, industrial property rights, technical processes, registered trade names and business assets;\n\n(e) Concessions granted under public law or under contract (including concessions for prospecting, cultivating, mining or development of natural resources) in respect of rights directly resulting from agreements concluded between the investor operating under a concession and the authority granting the concession.\n\nAny change in the legal form in which assets and capital have been invested or reinvested shall not affect their status as investments for the purposes of this Agreement.\n\nBIT, Exh. C-658, Art. 9(1) (emphasis added).\n\n370.\n\nIt is undisputed that, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this dispute, the Claimant must establish that it has made an investment which is protected under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention.487 Starting from the ICSID Convention, it is equally beyond dispute that the ICSID Convention does not define the term \"investment\". In the Tribunal's view, the absence of a definition of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention implies that the Contracting States intended to give to the term its ordinary meaning under Article 31(1) of the VCLT as opposed to a special meaning under Article 31(4) of the same treaty.488 As held by a number of recent investment awards, this ordinary meaning of the term is an objective one,489 and comprises the elements of (i) a contribution or allocation of resources, (ii) a duration; and (iii) risk, which includes the expectation (albeit not necessarily fulfilled) of a commercial return.490 As noted by the tribunal in *Saba Fakes*, these requirements \"are both necessary and sufficient to define an investment within the framework of the ICSID Convention\".491\n\nSee, amongst many, *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, Exh. CLA-38, para. 142 (\"It is well known that in order to qualify for protection under the ICSID/BIT mechanism, an investment has to satisfy the requirements of the definition of an investment both under the Washington Convention and the BIT.\").\n\nSee *also* *KT Asia,* para. 165; *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplun v.

C-658, first sentence (\"[t]he term \u2018investments' shall mean any kind of *assets* or any direct or indirect *contribution* in cash, in kind or in services, *invested or re-invested* in any economic activity whatsoever\", emphasis added).\n\n*Malicorp Limited v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/18, Award, 7 February 2011, Exh. RL-76, para. 110.\n\n372.\n\nAs is customary in definitions of investment contained in bilateral investment treaties, the BLEU-Algeria BIT then provides for a non-exhaustive list of \"investments\" protected under the Treaty.495 The listed items normally exhibit the hallmarks of an \"investment\" in the objective sense seen above. But, if any of these items does not correspond to the inherent definition of \"investment\", the fact that it falls within one of the categories listed in Article 1(2) does not transform it into an \"investment\".496 In other words, the use of the term \"investment\" in both the ICSID Convention and the BIT imports the same basic economic attributes of an investment derived from the ordinary meaning of that term, which comprises a contribution or allocation of resources, duration, and risk.\n\nSee BLEU-Algeria BIT, Article 1(2), second sentence, Exh. C-658.\n\n*KT Asia*, para. 165 (which in particular quotes *Romak S.A. (Switzerland) v. The Republic of Uzbekistan*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA280, Award, 26 November 2009, para. 207 (available on ITA website: http://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/ita0716. pdf)).\n\n373.\n\nWith those notions in mind, the Tribunal now turns to examining whether the Claimant made an investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\nb. **Did the Claimant make an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nWhile the Respondent concedes that *OTH* made an investment in Algeria,497 it disputes that the *Claimant* made an investment in the economy and on the territory of Algeria.\n\nSee Tr. Day 5 (Respondent\u2019s Closing), 134:21-134:23) (\"[...] OTH did carry out an initial investment; There's no dispute on that.\") and Tr. Day 1 (Respondent's Opening), 103:10-103:12 (\"We are not saying that the former investors didn\u2019t invest... The investment is still there from OTH\"). See also R-PHB 2, para. 78 *(\"Il n\u2019est pas* *contest\u00e9 par les Parties que, au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 2000, M. Naguib Sawiris et sa famille ont r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par le biais de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 OTH un investissement sur le territoire alg\u00e9rien au nom et pour le compte de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 OTA, prenant la forme de l'acquisition de la Licence GSM (et de la conclusion de la Convention d'Investissement*)\", (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n375.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant's alleged investment is its indirect shareholding in OTA, a company incorporated in Algeria, which held the GSM License granted by the Algerian Government for a price exceeding US$ 700 million. The BIT includes, among the non-exhaustive list of \"investments\", \"[s]hares, company shares, and any other form of participation, including minority or indirect participation, in companies constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party\". Accordingly, OTMTI's investment fulfills that part of the BIT definition. It thus remains to be seen whether it also meets the objective definition of investment applicable under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT, as discussed above.\n\n376.\n\nThe Claimant does not deny that the acquisition of its indirect participation in OTA occurred through a corporate restructuring and, more specifically, in the context of a broader set of transactions, the main purpose of which was to acquire Wind and in which the OTH shares were used as collateral. In this respect, the Respondent's overarching objection is that the *raison d'\u00eatre* of the Claimant's contributions towards the acquisition of OTA was to acquire Wind, rather than to invest in Algeria. The Tribunal does not consider this objection well-taken. The investor's motivations are irrelevant when assessing the existence of an investment in its objective meaning under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Algeria's insistence on a passage from *Quiborax* taken out of context is unhelpful. In that case, the tribunal did not seek to elevate the *raison d'\u00eatre* to an independent requirement of the definition of investment, but rather found that the claimant had made an investment irrespective of where the claimant had paid for the shares in an intermediary company, and noted in *obiter* that the *raison d'\u00eatre* for the payment was to acquire mining concessions in Bolivia.498 What matters for the purposes of the Tribunal's inquiry into the existence of an investment is whether the Claimant acquired OTA by making a contribution of resources, which entailed a certain duration and risk.\n\n*Quiborax*, para. 229.\n\n377.\n\nThe acquisition of the Claimant's indirect stake in OTA occurred in different stages through a number of complex transactions. Having carefully reviewed them, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Claimant has made at least the following contributions towards the acquisition of OTA:\n\na. First, the Claimant has established that it paid \u20ac294 million in cash to subscribe Weather Investments shares in August 2005, thereby increasing its indirect shareholding in OTA. On 10 August 2005, Weather Investments approved a capital increase and the Claimant (amongst other companies) subscribed directly to the share offering.499 The payment of this amount is proven by the Claimant\u2019s bank records500 and the Respondent does not deny that this payment was made.501 The fact that the amount of the payment was borrowed from the Sawiris Entities and later repaid does not change its nature of \"contribution\". Furthermore, for the reasons already mentioned, the fact that this transaction was part of the acquisition of Wind is immaterial, the *raison d'\u00eatre* of this contribution playing no role in this context.\n\nb. Second, the Claimant paid \u20ac248 million in cash when it purchased an additional 16.1% stake in Weather Investments from Enel. The Respondent\u2019s main objection in this connection is that the Claimant did not make a direct cash payment to Enel, but directed its subsidiaries, Weather Investments and WAHF, to pay Enel from a dividend payment of \u20ac281 million that Weather Investments owed to the Claimant.502 The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant\u2019s expert Mr. Tolkien that \"the satisfaction of OTMTI\u2019s obligation to pay cash to Enel for additional shares in Weather Investments by causing a dividend payment, which was due to OTMTI and would otherwise have been received by OTMTI, to be made to Enel was a legitimate corporate practice\".503 Thus, this amount, too, constitutes a contribution made by the Claimant.\n\nc. Third, the \u20ac1,025 billion cash payment made in June 2008 to acquire additional Weather Investments shares from Enel also constitutes a contribution which resulted in a further (indirect) shareholding in OTA. This transaction consisted in the repayment of a loan with interest.504 Initially, Algeria\u2019s objection was that it \"was not in a position to know whether the Claimant has wholly repaid these loans, nor the details of these potential repayments\".505 The Claimant then clarified that it had immediately repaid the bridge loans by tendering shares to the private equity investors that provided the bridge loans to the Claimant.506 Faced with this explanation, Algeria argued that these amounts were not paid by the Claimant, but by third parties. To this argument, the Claimant has convincingly replied that it \"repaid the loan of \u20ac962 million with interest - totaling \u20ac1,025 billion - using proceeds that it obtained from the sale of shares to other investors\".507 The Tribunal thus considers this to be a contribution made by the Claimant towards the acquisition of OTA.\n\nd. Finally, the Tribunal is further satisfied that the Claimant paid \u20ac44.47 million in cash to acquire additional Weather Investments shares from the so-called \"Middle Eastern investors\", thereby further increasing its indirect participation in OTA.508 The method of financing of this amount with which the Respondent takes issue, is not relevant for the purposes of determining whether the Claimant made a contribution.\n\nSee Weather Investments Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, 10 August 2005, Exh. C-690, at 9-10 (resolving the capital increase, and mentioning that the Claimant would pay \u20ac294 million) and especially Banca IMI, Weather II Regular Account Statements, 5 April 2006, Exh.

Tr. Day 5 (Respondent\u2019s Closing), 132:24-132:25.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 140.\n\nTolkien Third Report, para. 27.\n\nSee Rejoinder, para. 61.\n\nReply, para. 315.\n\nRejoinder, para. 63.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 63. See in particular Share Purchase and Investment Agreement between Weather II S.\u00e0.r.l. and PE Investors, 3 June 2008, Exh. C-618, Clauses 2.2-2.3, 3.2-3.3.\n\nWeather II Annual Accounts for 2006, Exh. C-670, p. 7.\n\n378.\n\nAccordingly, it is established that the Claimant made contributions exceeding at least \u20ac1.5 billion towards its acquisition of an indirect interest in OTA via the purchase of shares of Weather Investments. The requirement for the existence of a contribution as an element of an investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT is thus fulfilled.\n\n379.\n\nThe requirement of duration does not appear disputed by the Respondent, and rightly so, as the Claimant held its indirect shareholding in OTA for almost six years. With regard to the element of risk, the Tribunal is equally satisfied that by acquiring and holding an indirect stake in OTA the Claimant bore the risk inherent in holding shares, namely the risk that the value of the shares may decline.\n\n380.\n\nAs a consequence, the three requirements for the existence of an investment, i.e. contribution, duration, and risk, are all met. In other words, the Claimant made a number of successive investments within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n381.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, there is no need to determine whether the following other transactions also constitute an investment: (i) the Claimant's initial acquisition of its indirect shareholding in OTA in August 2005 through a share-to-share exchange between the Claimant and Weather Investments; (ii) the Claimant's alleged contribution of US$ 1.2 billion through \"reinvested OTA earnings\"; (iii) the \u20ac2.48 million alleged contributions from the Claimant to Weather Investments between 2006 and 2010, in exchange for Weather Investments' financial assistance to the Weather Group companies; (iv) the Claimant's alleged contribution in services to OTA through Weather Investments and OTSE; and (v) the Claimant's alleged contribution in personnel and know-how to OTA. Similarly, it is not determinative of jurisdiction whether the assets and rights of OTA qualify as investments of the Claimant. Whatever the determination on these other alleged investments, it would not change the conclusion that the Claimant made investments in Algeria that fall under the protection of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n382.\n\nThe Respondent has raised a number of other objections in relation to the alleged lack of an investment. First, Algeria appears to argue that the Claimant must have purchased shares directly in Algeria for them to fall within the BIT\u2019s definition of \"investment\". The Tribunal cannot follow this argument, which is not supported by the text of the BIT. What is required is that the \"investment\" be located in the territory of Algeria - which is undoubtedly the case with respect to OTA, the local company \"constituted on the territory of one of the Contracting Parties\". In fact, as was observed by the tribunal in *Gold Reserve*, requiring a flow of funds directly into the host state would preclude a foreign investor from purchasing an existing investment from another foreign investor, because the purchase price would necessarily be paid to the foreign seller of the investment.509 In response to a question from the Tribunal at the Hearing, the Respondent gave the following answer:\n\n[If a buyer] buys from [a seller] a French company that has a subsidiary in Algeria, the operation takes place in France; [the buyer] enters Algeria because it buys from [the seller] a participation. Now, I don\u2019t deny that it is an investment in Algeria. [...]\n\n*Gold Reserve*, Exh. CLA-276, paras. 261-262 (\"According to the ordinary meaning of the words, \u2018making an investment in the territory of Venezuela\u2019 does not require that there must be a movement of capital or other values across Venezuelan borders. If such a condition were inferred it would mean that an existing investment in Venezuela, owned or controlled by a non-Venezuelan entity, would not be protected by the BIT if it were acquired by a third party, with cash or other consideration being paid outside Venezuela, even if the acquiring party then invested funds into Venezuela to finance the activity of the acquired business. Clearly, this was not the intention of the parties to the BIT and nor does it reflect the ordinary meaning of the definition\").\n\n383.\n\nThe Tribunal has difficulty understanding why, in the Respondent\u2019s example, a third-party purchaser of shares of a company that operates in the host state would make an investment in the host state, but a related company purchasing the same shares through a corporate restructuring would not.510\n\nSee also *Gold Reserve*, para. 270 (rejecting a similar objection).\n\n384.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that the BIT excludes from its protection the \"simple holding of an indirect share\". Again, the Tribunal cannot agree. No \"active\" involvement is required under the BIT, which protects both \"minority or indirect\" shareholding. Nor is there such a requirement under the ICSID Convention. As noted by the tribunal in *Phoenix*, Shares or other participation in the capital of a company are usually considered as an investment. The Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent\u2019s contention that \"mere ownership of shares does not automatically qualify as an \"investment\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\" [\u2026] ICSID tribunals have not endorsed a distinction between full owners and majority or even minority shareholders, or direct or indirect control in the investment treaty, who necessarily play a less than decisive role in corporate governance.511\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, Exh. CLA-194, para. 121.\n\n385.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant's indirect shareholding in OTA constitutes an investment pursuant to Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**D. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY OBJECTIONS IN RELATION TO THE CLAIMANT'S STATUS OFINDIRECT SHAREHOLDER, THE OTH ARBITRATION AND SETTLEMENT, AND THE SALE OF THE CLAIMANT'S INVESTMENT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nThe Respondent has raised a number of objections in relation to the Claimant's (former) status as indirect investor and the parallel arbitral proceedings started by OTH. The characterization of these objections in terms of jurisdiction or admissibility has somewhat changed in the course of the proceedings. In sum, the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction or that the claims should be declared inadmissible on the following grounds: First, the Claimant is or was a \"very indirect\" shareholder which is \"too far removed\" from the investment affected by the Respondent's measures (1); Second the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or the claims are inadmissible as a result of the concurrent proceedings launched by OTH which resulted in a settlement between the parties to those proceedings (2); Third, the Claimant sold its investment before filing the Request for Arbitration and has thus lost or waived its right to bring arbitration proceedings against Algeria, which either deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction or entails the inadmissibility of the claims (3). The Tribunal will first set out the Parties' positions on all of these issues (1-3), and then proceed with its analysis (4).\n\n**1. Does the Respondent's consent extend to \"very indirect\" shareholders that are \"too far removed\" from the investment affected by the Respondent's measures?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n387.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant is (or was) an indirect shareholder in OTA \"too far removed\" (*trop \u00e9loign\u00e9*) from the investment in OTA. It invokes the need to fix a \"cut-off point\" in the corporate chain beyond which a tribunal lacks jurisdiction.\n\n388.\n\nWhile the Respondent recognizes that past decisions have admitted claims by indirect shareholders based on BITs in order to protect \"the real party in interest\",512 it points out that arbitral tribunals and scholars have also insisted on the importance of limiting the number of shareholders entitled to claim, especially taking into account the dangers associated with the proliferation of arbitral proceedings based on the same facts commenced by different shareholders.513\n\nSee Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 221, discussing *Antoine Goetz and others v.

The Claimant was created in 2005, i.e. after the investment was made in Algeria, and only OTH participated in the process of attribution of the GSM License to OTA;\n\nb. The Claimant has not taken part in the negotiation and conclusion of the Investment Agreement in 2001 between Algeria, OTH and Oratel (acting on behalf of OTA);\n\nc. The corporate chain was constituted in 2005 in the context of the Wind acquisition, and the \" *raison d'\u00eatre* \" of such transaction was to take over Wind, not to invest in Algeria;\n\nd. At the end of 2008, when the challenged measures began, there were no less than 8 companies, on 5 different levels, inserted in the corporate chain between the Claimant and OTA. Such a \"remoteness\" or distance (*\u00e9loignement*) between a claimant-indirect shareholder and the locally incorporated company, which is the subject of the investment as well as of the contested measures, has never been considered by any ICSID tribunal to date;\n\ne. The Claimant has not established that it was exercising effective control over OTA.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 231.\n\n393.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent rebuts the Claimant's argument that the measures directly targeted the Claimant. The only document which the Claimant addressed to Algeria between 2005 and 2010 is a letter dated 4 October 2010, in which the representatives of the Claimant and VimpelCom informed the Algerian Prime Minister of the execution of the merger agreement between the two companies.521 Had the Claimant believed that the measures adopted between 2008 and 2010 targeted OTMTI, it would have objected to such measures at the relevant time, as was done by OTA, OTH and Weather Investments, but not by the Claimant.522\n\nReply, para. 335, discussing Letter from Weather II and VimpelCom Ltd. to Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, 4 October 2010, Exh.

CLA-117.\n\n397.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, no tribunal has ever denied an indirect shareholder\u2019s claims based on an asserted \"cut-off point\", when the language of the treaty expressly covered indirect investments.533 The Claimant criticizes the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the *obiter dictum* in *Enron* (stating that a \"cut-off point\" may be needed for an investor only \"remotely connected\" to the investment). That *dictum* lacks legal foundation and the tribunal\u2019s statement that an invitation by the state to participate in the investment can somehow create or reinforce privity runs contrary to basic investment treaty principles.534 The Claimant also argues that the criteria suggested by Algeria to determine a cut-off point535 are not supported by legal authority.536\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 97, 101; Rejoinder, para. 246.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 101.\n\nSee *supra,* para. 391.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 102.\n\n398.\n\nIn any event, even if the Tribunal were to accept the theoretical possibility of a cut-off point and the criteria proposed by Algeria, this would not bar jurisdiction here for the following reasons:\n\na. OTMTI was the controlling shareholder of OTA holding a substantial 36% interest;537\n\nb. Algeria invited OTMTI's shareholders (the Sawiris family) to invest in Algeria without any limits on corporate organization; if a company's shareholders are not too remote to bring a claim, the company itself cannot be too remote either;538\n\nc. The Respondent was aware that OTMTI owned and controlled OTA;539\n\nd. Algeria dealt with Mr. Sawiris in connection with OTA in his capacity as Chairman of Weather Investments and Chairman of OTH, positions he held as a result of OTMTI's ownership of those entities;540\n\ne. Algeria did not object that U.S. private equity investors, who were equally removed from OTA, were too remote to have their concerns addressed;541 and\n\nf. It was Algeria's measures that compelled OTMTI to bring this claim rather than an entity closer to OTA in the corporate chain.542 In particular, it is because of the enactment of the Supplementary Finance Act of 2009 and the Finance Law of 2010, and because of the threats to expropriate OTA if its indirect ownership changed without Algeria's express consent, that OTMTI is the Claimant in this arbitration;543\n\ng. With regard to the Respondent's argument that each of OTH, Weather Investments and the Claimant would be permitted to bring a BIT claim under the Egypt-Algeria, Italy-Algeria and BLEU-Algeria BITs respectively, but that they could not raise claims simultaneously, the Claimant opposes that it had no control over OTH's initiation or settlement of the OTH Arbitration, because OTH was no longer part of the Weather Group of companies when it raised these claims.544\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 104.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 105.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 106.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 107.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 107.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 108-111.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 111.

If the harm to different claimants is distinct, there is no risk of double recovery. If the harm is not distinct, tribunals have tools at their disposal to guard against double recovery.548 Here, the Claimant contends that its harm is distinct from the harm allegedly suffered by any other party that has started arbitration against Algeria. Algeria\u2019s unlawful measures caused OTMTI to sell its interest in OTA for a price far below the one which it would have obtained without these measures. This harm is specific to OTMTI; no other party bringing claims against Algeria could recover compensation for this damage.549 In any event, the mere possibility of double recovery is not a ground for denying jurisdiction.550\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 114.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 114.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 114, discussing *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v.

Objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction or the admissibility of the claims in relation to the OTH Arbitration and the Settlement Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. **The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nThe Respondent first argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or should declare the claims inadmissible because there is no dispute between the Claimant and Algeria within the meaning of Article 9 of the BIT (i). It further claims that OTH\u2019s exercise of the right to bring arbitration proceedings against Algeria deprived the Claimant of standing to pursue its claims against the Respondent (ii) and renders its claims inadmissible. Moreover, Mr. Sawiris used his group of companies to seek to maximize his chances of success by introducing several arbitrations against the Respondent at different levels of the chain of companies, which is a further ground for the inadmissibility of the claims under the doctrine of abuse of rights (iii). Finally, the Tribunal should further decline jurisdiction or declare the claims inadmissible as a result of the Settlement Agreement, which has resolved the disputes opposing OTA and OTH to Algeria (iv).\n\n**i. There is no dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent under Article 9 of the BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n403.\n\nFirst, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this dispute, which does not fall within the type of disputes covered by Article 9 of the BIT.552 The Respondent relies on the definition of \"dispute\" in *Mavrommatis* - a \"disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between two persons\"553 - and submits that a dispute requires a certain level of communication between the investor and the state leading to a disagreement.554 Furthermore, for the Respondent, \"the subject matter of the negotiations should be the same as the dispute that is brought before\" the tribunal.555\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 233-241; R-PHB 1, paras. 153-163.\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012, Exh. CLA-210, para. 123.\n\n404.\n\nThe Respondent's position is that the dispute which the Claimant submitted to arbitration on 19 October 2012 is not a \"dispute\" between OTMTI and the Algerian state pursuant to Article 9 of the BIT,556 which reads as follows:\n\n1. Any dispute relating to investments between a contracting party and an investor of the other contracting party shall be the subject of a written notification from the most diligent party.\n\nAs far as is possible, such a dispute shall be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. Should there be no amicable settlement by direct arrangement between the parties to the dispute or through conciliation by diplomatic means during the six (6) months from the notification thereof, the dispute shall be subject, at the request of one or other of the parties to the dispute, to arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) [\u2026].\n\nReply, para. 342; R-PHB 1, para. 155.\n\n405.\n\nThe Respondent advances various reasons in support of its argumentation. It contends that at the time of the Request for Arbitration there was no dispute between the Parties about *the measures adopted between 2008 and 2010 in connection with OTA* :\n\na. Between 2008 and 2010, the Claimant never criticized the measures adopted by Algeria vis-\u00e0-vis OTA, nor did it make any reservation of rights in this respect;557\n\nb. It is undisputed that there was no communication between the Parties before 2012558 (except for the Claimant\u2019s letter of 4 October 2010 advising Algeria of the merger of OTMTI and VimpelCom);559\n\nc. OTA\u2019s situation was not mentioned in any of the meetings of the Claimant\u2019s corporate organs or in any of its annual reports;560\n\nd. While Mr. Sawiris objected several times to Algeria\u2019s measures in his function as representative of OTA and OTH,561 the minutes of the corporate organs of OTMTI evince that the issue of OTA and OTH was raised for the first time at the meeting of the Board of Managers of 18 October 2012 at 11 pm, i.e. on the eve of the filing of the Request for Arbitration. At this meeting, Mr. Sawiris then asked the Board to ratify his decision to commence arbitration proceedings against Algeria.562\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 239; Reply, para. 343; R-PHB 1, para. 158.\n\nReply, para. 343.\n\nLetter from Weather II and VimpelCom Ltd. to Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, 4 October 2010, Exh. R-12.\n\nReply, para. 343.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 241.\n\nReply, para. 343.\n\n406.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that there is no dispute between the Parties to this arbitration *in relation to the sale by OTMTI of its shareholding in Weather Investments to VimpelCom* :\n\na. When the transaction closed, OTMTI expressed no reservations on the transaction and did not assert that Algeria\u2019s measures had caused it damage. To the contrary, Mr. Sawiris repeatedly stated his satisfaction about the sale in the media;563\n\nb. At the time of the closing, OTMTI represented that there was no \"action taken or to be taken by Weather I or such Weather II Shareholder in connection with, or which seeks to enjoin or obtain monetary damages in respect of, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby\";564\n\nc. There is no mention in the Notice of Dispute of 16 April 2012 of the sale to VimpelCom, whereas in this arbitration the Claimant submits that \"the core of [the] Claimant\u2019s case\" centers around the damage it suffered through Algeria\u2019s measures which forced it to sell its interest in OTA to VimpelCom.565 Thus, the alleged dispute which Mr. Sawiris notified on 16 April 2012 on behalf of Weather II is not the one which gives rise to the claims brought in this arbitration;566\n\nd. Therefore, absent notification of a \"dispute\" arising from the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom at a reduced price, the Parties could not attempt to reach an amicable resolution of this \"dispute\" in accordance with Article 9(1) of the BIT.567\n\nReply, para. 344.\n\nReply, para. 344, referring to Share Sale and Exchange Agreement between Weather Investments II, VimpelCom and the Shareholders of Wind Telecom, 17 January 2011, Exh.

In his 16 April 2012 Notice of Dispute, Mr. Sawaris characterized his dispute with Algeria \"by reference\" to the letters that OTA, OTH and Weather Investments had sent at the time to the Algerian state, which referred to the measures impugned by these entities;568\n\nb. In its Request for Arbitration, OTMTI simply adopted the content of OTH's Notice of Arbitration in the OTH Arbitration. Similarly, the Claimant's Memorial presents several similarities with OTH's Statement of Claim in that arbitration.569\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 242; Reply, para. 345; R-PHB 1, para. 158; R-PHB 2, para. 105.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 243; Reply, para. 345.\n\n408.\n\nFourth, Mr. Sawiris has in reality introduced this arbitration on his own initiative and for personal reasons, in order to avenge himself of Algeria and to claim damages which he asserts to have suffered:\n\na. The examination of the minutes of the Claimant's Board of Managers and shareholders meetings confirm that Mr. Sawiris did not consult the corporate organs about the filing of the Notice of Dispute and that he communicated to the Board of Managers his decision to file for arbitration mere hours before the filing;570\n\nb. Mr. Sawiris has expressed his resentment against Algeria in the media; he blames the state for having \"broken his dream\". The personal character of this arbitration is further confirmed by the claim for moral damage.571\n\nReply, para. 346.\n\nReply, para. 346.\n\n409.\n\nAccordingly, continues the Respondent, the conditions of Article 9 of the BIT are not fulfilled. Mr. Sawiris has not notified a dispute between the Claimant and Algeria572 and the dispute which he submits on behalf of OTMTI is not a \"dispute [\u2026] between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party\".573\n\nR-PBH 1, para. 157.\n\nReply, para. 347; R-PHB 1, para. 159.\n\n410.\n\nIn conclusion, for the Respondent, the absence of a dispute between the Parties to this arbitration on the day of the Notice of Dispute on 16 April 2012 deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the dispute subsequently raised in the Claimant's memorials.574 By contrast, if the Tribunal were to consider that a dispute between the Parties existed then but that it was not notified in accordance with Article 9(1) of the BIT, the claims arising from this dispute would be inadmissible.575\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 108.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 108 (\" *l'absence de diff\u00e9rend opposant les Parties \u00e0 l'arbitrage au jour de la notification du 16 avril 2012 entra\u00eene l'incomp\u00e9tence du Tribunal arbitral pour trancher le diff\u00e9rend soulev\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement par la Demanderesse dans ses \u00e9critures.

OTH's exercise of the right to start arbitration against Algeria deprived the Claimant of standing to sue the Respondent**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s claims are inadmissible because the Claimant lost standing to bring arbitration proceedings (*int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*) against the Respondent, when Mr. Sawiris decided to exercise OTH\u2019s right to arbitrate (*droit d'agir*) by submitting a Notice of Dispute under the Egypt-Algeria BIT on 2 November 2010.576\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 180-190; R-PHB 2, paras. 119-126.\n\n412.\n\nFrom 2005 until 2011, when Weather Investments was sold to VimpelCom, so says the Respondent, the Claimant and its subsidiaries formed a vertically integrated group of companies (*une cha\u00eene de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s verticalement int\u00e9gr\u00e9e*), in which the Claimant held an indirect controlling shareholding in OTA through a number of companies including Weather Investments and OTH. The Claimant, in turn, was owned by the Sawiris Entities, whose shareholders were certain trusts established for the benefit of Mr. Sawiris and his family.577 The Respondent contends that as the subsidiaries in the group, including Weather Investments and OTH, were answerable to and controlled by OTMTI, the decisions taken by the former must be opposable to the latter.578\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 181.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 182.\n\n413.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that in 2005 each of the companies interposed between the Sawiris Entities and OTA held a theoretical claim vis-\u00e0-vis Algeria, on different legal bases: (i) OTA on the basis of the Investment Agreement; (ii) OTH on the basis of the Egypt-Algeria BIT; (iii) Weather Investments on the basis of the Italy-Algeria BIT; and (iv) the Claimant on the basis of the BLEU-Algeria BIT.579\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 183.\n\n414.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Mr. Sawiris chose to crystallize the dispute between OTA and Algeria at the level of OTA\u2019s direct shareholder, namely OTH.580 From 2009 on, OTH started challenging the legality and effect of the measures adopted vis-\u00e0-vis OTA with the Algerian authorities. In particular on 2 November 2010, it notified the existence of a dispute on the basis of the Egypt-Algeria BIT.581 Subsequently, on 8 November 2010, Mr. Sawiris, this time representing Weather Investments, notified the existence of a dispute under the Italy-Algeria BIT.582 And finally, on 16 April 2012, Mr. Sawiris, acting as the Chairman of the Claimant, notified the existence of a dispute under the BLEU-Algeria BIT.583 Through these three notices, Mr. Sawiris contested the legality and effect of the same measures in the name and on behalf of three group companies.584\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 184.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 184, discussing Letter from OTH to Algeria, 2 November 2010, Exh.

C-30.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 185.\n\n415.\n\nMr. Sawiris' choice to crystallize the dispute between OTA and Algeria at the level of OTH by way of the first Notice of Dispute had the automatic effect (*a eu m\u00e9caniquement pour effet*), so argues Algeria, that any other company in the chain, including the Claimant, lost standing to sue (*int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*) the Algerian state.585 For the Respondent, the Claimant's argument that OTH's Notice of Dispute has \"no legal significance\" and that it is OTH's notice of 12 April 2012 that matters is ill-founded. In investment treaty arbitration, the notification of the existence of a dispute constitutes the point of departure of any claim for damages grounded on a BIT.586\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 186.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 120.\n\n416.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that Mr. Sawiris' choice to crystallize the dispute at the level of OTH allowed the Claimant to be made whole (*a permis \u00e0 la Demanderesse d'\u00eatre remplie de ses droits*).587 In the OTH Arbitration, OTH claimed that its damage corresponded to the loss of value of its participation in OTA (*la perte de valeur totale de sa participation dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 OTA*) caused by the measures adopted by the Algerian authorities. When Mr. Sawiris exercised OTH's right to file a claim (*droit d'agir*) under the Egypt-Algeria BIT, he substituted in OTH's assets the loss of value of the OTA shares with a claim for damages. Such claim sought reparation for the diminution in value of OTH's assets due to the loss in value of its shares in OTA from the tribunal under the Egypt-Algeria BIT.588 Hence, to the extent the direct shareholder OTH was made whole by exercising its right to arbitration under the Egypt-Algeria BIT, all companies placed in the chain between OTH and the Sawiris Entities, including the Claimant, have been made whole, unless they incurred harm specific to their entity (*en l'absence de pr\u00e9judice propre*).589\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 187.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 188.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 189.\n\n**iii. Mr. Sawiris' conduct in the name and on behalf of the Claimant constitutes an abuse of rights**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that the claims must be dismissed under the doctrine of abuse of rights.590 Mr. Sawiris has sought to maximize his chances of success by introducing several arbitrations against the Respondent at different levels of the chain of companies. In doing so, he has abused the protection offered by Algeria to foreign investors.591 This is particularly unfair towards Algeria, as the claimants in the various proceedings need to succeed only once for the alleged harm to be remedied.592\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 191-196.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 193.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 194.\n\n418.\n\nThe Respondent claims that, when it entered into BITs with Belgium/Luxembourg, Italy and Egypt, it did not intend to protect under different treaties shareholders who belonged to the same group and disputed the same measures.593\n\nR-PHB 1, fn. 442; R-PHB 2, para. 129.\n\n419.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s argument that a state should be held to its offer to arbitrate in any circumstance and whatever the investor\u2019s conduct, is contrary to case law applying the doctrine of abuse of rights.594 Here, the doctrine allows to limit the right of multiple shareholders in the same chain to bring arbitrations in order to avoid the proliferation of proceedings arising out of the same facts.595\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 128.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 196.\n\n**iv. The Tribunal should decline jurisdiction or declare the claims inadmissible as a result of the Settlement Agreement between OTA, OTH andAlgeria**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s further argument that the Tribunal may not rule on a dispute which ceased to exist because the parties to this dispute have settled it.\n\n421.\n\nMore specifically, on 18 April 2014, VimpelCom, OTH and the Algerian *Fonds National d'Investissement* (the \"FNI\") concluded a Share Purchase Agreement (the \"SPA\"), according to which OTH (now GTH) sold a 51% stake in OTA to the FNI for a price of US$ 2,643 billion.596 On the same day, OTH and Algeria suspended the OTH Arbitration in the wake of the closing of the share purchase pursuant to Article 7.4(a) of the SPA.597\n\nShare Purchase Agreement between OTH, VimpelCom and the FNI, 18 April 2014, Exh.

(the \"SPA\") with respect to facts that formed the basis of the claims raised in the Arbitration, and further waive those claims that could have been brought in the Arbitration as at the date of signing of the SPA on the basis of the allegations of fact relating to the 3G license included in the parties' written submissions in the Arbitration;\n\n(3) This amicable settlement is concluded with no admission of guilt or liability with respect to the claims that are waived by GTH and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria.

People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, PCA Case No. 2012-20, Award on Agreed Terms, 12 March 2015, Exh. R-307.\n\nReply, para. 145.\n\n424.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, to allow a very indirect minority shareholder (or a former shareholder) of OTA to request an arbitral tribunal to rule on a dispute involving the legality of certain measures, which OTA and its parent company have decided to not further pursue, would circumvent a direct arrangement between the parties to the dispute and run counter to the BIT Contracting Parties' intention.606 If such a course were admitted, a respondent state would never settle a dispute amicably as it would always face the risk that other shareholders circumvent the amicable settlement and bring proceedings over the (settled) dispute.607\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 251; Reply, para. 349.\n\nReply, para. 350; R-PHB 1, para. 223.\n\n425.\n\nFor the Respondent, an arbitral tribunal cannot affirm jurisdiction over a dispute that has ceased to exist.608 Algeria points to *Azpetrol v. Azerbaijan,* where the tribunal declined jurisdiction after the parties had settled their dispute.609 Citing further to *SAUR v. Argentina*, the Respondent maintains that a settlement agreement does affect the rights of the shareholder controlling the subsidiary which entered into the settlement.610\n\nReply, para. 352, discussing Article 43(1) of the ICSID Rules (which provides that \"[i]f, before the award is rendered, the parties agree on a settlement of the dispute or otherwise to discontinue the proceeding, the Tribunal, or the Secretary-General if the Tribunal has not yet been constituted, shall, at their written request, in an order take note of the discontinuance of the proceeding\").\n\nReply, para. 353, discussing *Azpetrol Int'l Holdings B.V., Azpetrol Group B.V. and Azpetrol Oil Services Group B.V. v. The Republic of Azerbaijan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/15, Award, 8 September 2009, Exh. RL-233.\n\nReply, para. 357, discussing *SAUR Int'l SA v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/4, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, 6 June 2012, Exh. RL-238.\n\n426.\n\nThe Respondent recognizes that, in this case, Mr. Sawiris sold OTMTI\u2019s shares in Weather Investments to VimpelCom before the conclusion of the settlement agreement. However, it insists that it was for OTMTI to negotiate a better deal with VimpelCom then. It cannot complain now on the basis of the consideration received by OTA and OTH under the SPA.611\n\nReply, para. 359.\n\n427.\n\nAlternatively, the Respondent submits that the Settlement Agreement between OTA, OTH and Algeria may be opposed to the Claimant, which renders the claims inadmissible.612 Algeria contends that the claims of the indirect shareholder (the Claimant) are identical to those of the direct shareholder (OTH).613 For the Respondent, both sets of claims are based on the same measures614 and the Claimant has raised the same claims as those originally brought by OTH in the OTH Arbitration.615 More specifically, the Claimant\u2019s claims relating to the loss in value of its indirect shareholding in OTA are necessarily contained in OTH\u2019s claim in the OTH Arbitration, where OTH sought damages based on the reduction in value of its shares in OTA.616 The same is true of the claims concerning the dividends raised in the two arbitrations. Indeed, the Claimant held an indirect stake in OTA through OTH, and thus any dividend distributed by OTA to OTH would have been distributed further up by OTH to the Claimant.617\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 208-226. See in particular *ibid*, para. 226 (\" *le r\u00e8glement amiable des diff\u00e9rends opposant OTA et OTH \u00e0 l'\u00c9tat alg\u00e9rien doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre opposable \u00e0 Weather II, et les demandes de Weather II doivent en cons\u00e9quence \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9es irrecevables* \").\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 209-212.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 209.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 210.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 210.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 210.\n\n428.\n\nThere are still other types of claims in this arbitration, so says the Respondent, which cannot be considered by this Tribunal. For example, the claims for consequential damages allegedly incurred by the \"Weather Group\" as a result of the need to refinance OTH cannot be invoked by the Claimant, as OTH and Weather Investments (not the Claimant) provided the funds for refinancing.618 And the alleged \"moral damage\" connected to a reputational damage is made in consideration of Mr. Sawiris\u2019 reputation (not the Claimant\u2019s).619\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 211.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 211.\n\n429.\n\nAs a result, it is clear for the Respondent that the claims in the two arbitrations are identical. The claims of the direct shareholder were settled in conditions which do not render the transaction dubious or otherwise subject to criticism. That settlement has put an end to all the disputes with OTA and OTH.620 Indeed, the settlement was entered into by OTH in its own name and on behalf of OTA, OTH being the \"historical\" controlling shareholder of OTA, to which the GSM License was granted in 2001 and which negotiated and concluded the Investment Agreement in 2001. Furthermore, it was OTH which in 2009-2010 objected to the measures taken vis-\u00e0-vis OTA and which sent the first Notice of Dispute on 2 November 2010.621\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 213-214.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 219.\n\n430.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimant cannot invoke its status of former indirect shareholder of OTA and OTH to establish jurisdiction and engage the Respondent's liability for disputes opposing OTA and OTH to Algeria and, at the same time, pretend that the settlement of these disputes is not opposable precisely because of its status of former shareholder.622 The amicable settlement must thus be opposed to the Claimant,623 especially as the Claimant does not deny that it held a direct minority interest in OTH at the time of the conclusion and closing of the SPA.624\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 215.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 218.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 113.\n\n431.\n\nFrom the Respondent's viewpoint, the settlement was intended to finally resolve the disputes of OTA and OTH with Algeria, in such as fashion that no other forum could rule on the legality of the measures adopted by the Algerian authorities vis-\u00e0-vis OTA and OTH.625 To allow (former) direct and indirect shareholders of OTH to bring arbitration proceedings arising from the same facts and requiring thus to review the legality of Algeria's measures would in practice nullify the settlement agreement.626 This would expose Algeria to the concrete risk of multiple proceedings, considering the number of companies in the Weather Group and the fact that OTH was a listed company.627\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 220.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 221; R-PHB 2, para. 116.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 222; R-PHB 2, paras. 116-117.\n\n432.\n\nBy contrast, opposing the settlement agreement to the Claimant would be in line with scholarly views seeking to transpose domestic law principles on the limitations to shareholder's claims within investment law.628 Investment jurisprudence allowing indirect shareholders to claim for indirect damages resulting from measures taken by the host state against the local company is subject to criticism.629 Rather than following this line, an investment treaty tribunal should adopt the approach chosen by the International Court of Justice and carefully examine the rules of municipal legal systems on shareholders' claims. The Respondent refers to scholarly writings of Zachary Douglas and others.630\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 224.\n\nR-PHB 2, paras. 133-134.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 323-327; Reply, paras. 451-461.\n\n433.\n\nIn reliance on generally accepted domestic rules, the Respondent submits that only claims for damages resulting from a violation by the host state of the rights tied to the quality of direct shareholder or of the commitments towards the shareholder (but not the local company) are admissible. By contrast, shareholders may not claim for damages suffered by the local company, which is the subject of the investment.631 This is the case even if the direct or indirect shareholder invokes the loss of value of its shares in the local company as a result of the host state\u2019s measures.632\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 324; Reply, para. 458.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 324; Reply, para. 458.\n\n434.\n\nIn this case, the Respondent notes that the Claimant invokes the loss resulting from the diminution of value of its indirect shareholding in OTA as a result of Algeria\u2019s allegedly wrongful measures against OTA. However, the Respondent observes, only OTA could bring claims for damages based on the loss of value of its assets (*sur la perte de valeur de son patrimoine*), which claims it has settled.633\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 224; Reply, para. 459.\n\n435.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent refutes the Claimant\u2019s submission that Algeria\u2019s measures damaged its right to receive dividends from 2009 to 2011. For the Respondent, that right only belongs to OTA\u2019s direct shareholders, such as OTH. Indirect shareholder have no entitlement for these dividends; otherwise Algeria would be required to compensate twice both the direct and indirect shareholders for the same damage.634 In this respect, the Respondent notes that the Settlement Agreement provides as a condition precedent that OTA must effect a distribution of its dividends to its direct shareholders, including OTH. Consequently, the claims in this respect must be declared inadmissible.635\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 326; Reply, para. 460.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 224.\n\n**b. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nThe Claimant submits that a dispute has existed between the Parties at all times since the Claimant notified the Respondent on 16 April 2012 (i). Further, OTH\u2019s commencement of separate arbitration proceedings against the Respondent is irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or the admissibility of the claims in this arbitration, and the Respondent\u2019s invocation of the doctrine of abuse of rights is ill-founded (ii). Finally, the subsequent settlement of the OTH Arbitration is equally without pertinence to this tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and to the admissibility of the claims before it (iii).\n\n**i. There is a dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent under Article 9 of the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nFor the Claimant, a dispute has existed between the Parties at all times since the Claimant's notification on 16 April 2012.636\n\nRejoinder, para. 251, referring to the Letter from Weather II to Algeria, 16 April 2012, Exh. C-30.\n\n438.\n\nIt is the Claimant's submission that the standard for the existence of a dispute, which is set out in *Mavrommatis* as well as in other ICJ and investment treaty cases, is met here. In particular, on 16 April 2012, the Claimant put Algeria on notice that there was an investment dispute between them under Article 9 of the BIT, arising out of a series of unlawful measures that the Respondent took against the Claimant's investment in OTA from 2008 on.637\n\nRejoinder, paras. 253-254.\n\n439.\n\nThe Claimant further alleges that it sent numerous additional letters to the Respondent during the following six months, repeatedly underscoring its readiness to seek a settlement.638 On 20 September 2012, representatives for the Claimant and the Respondent met in Paris in an attempt to resolve the dispute amicably. By 17 October 2012, six months had elapsed since the Notice of Dispute of 16 April 2012 without an amicable solution being reached, and the Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration on 19 October 2012.639 For the Claimant, it is clear that in correspondence and at the meeting of 20 September 2012, the Claimant specifically notified the Respondent of the existence of a dispute.640\n\nRejoinder, para. 255, discussing Letter from Claimant to Respondent, 15 May 2012, Exh.

C-30, p. 2.\n\nRejoinder, para. 260.\n\n442.\n\nIn any event, in its Request for Arbitration, so argues the Claimant, it specifically notified the Respondent that \"in light of the devastating financial impact of the Measures on OTA and its stakeholders, [the Claimant] had no choice but to sell [...] a percentage of its indirect shareholding in OTA to third parties, at a distressed price\".645 Investment treaty tribunals have confirmed that a request for arbitration which sets forth the facts and legal arguments on which the Claimant relies with respect to the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under the applicable treaty is sufficient to establish the existence of a dispute.646\n\nRejoinder, para. 261, discussing Request for Arbitration, 19 October 2012, para. 61.\n\nRejoinder, para. 261-263, discussing *Tradex Hellas S.A. v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 December 1996, Exh. CLA-232, p. 188.\n\n443.\n\nFinally, according to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s objection that the dispute notified by Mr. Sawiris (on behalf of OTMTI) on 16 April 2012 and the one before this Tribunal are not the same647 is both untimely, as it was raised by the Respondent for the very first time in its PostHearing Brief, and devoid of merit.648 Investment tribunals have held that an investor is not required to spell out its case in detail in the notice of dispute. It is sufficient for the notice to inform the host state of a dispute which engages the state\u2019s international responsibility under the applicable treaty.649 Tribunals have declined jurisdiction over claims only in the rare circumstance where those claims were clearly separate and distinct from the matters raised in the notice of dispute.650 In this case, so argues the Claimant, it has not raised any new claim. In its Request for Arbitration and Memorial on the Merits, it has merely explained the effect of the unlawful measures described in the Notice of Dispute, which, it argues, crystallized in losses of billions of dollars when the Claimant sold Weather Investments to VimpelCom.651\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 161.\n\nC-PHB 2, paras. 82-90.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 85.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 88.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 90.\n\n**ii. OTH's commencement of separate arbitration proceedings is irrelevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction or the admissibility of the claims**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n444.\n\nThe Claimant submits that OTH\u2019s commencement of separate arbitration proceedings against the Respondent is irrelevant to jurisdiction and admissibility in this arbitration.\n\n445.\n\nFirst, it is the Claimant\u2019s argument that OTH\u2019s Notice of Dispute of 2 November 2010 has no legal significance other than to fulfil the procedural requirements under the Algeria-Egypt BIT.652 At the time when OTH commenced the OTH Arbitration on 12 April 2012, the Claimant had sold its indirect controlling shareholding in OTH to VimpelCom, on whose board it never had a seat.653 Hence, neither the Claimant nor Mr. Sawiris were involved in OTH\u2019s decision to initiate the OTH Arbitration.654\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 170.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 171; C-PHB 2, para. 92.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 171.\n\n446.\n\nFurther, the terms of the Respondent's consent as set forth in the BIT establish the scope of a tribunal's jurisdiction. Here, according to the BIT, the Respondent's consent expressly extends to any dispute with a Luxembourgish investor relating to that investor's minority or indirect shareholding in an Algerian company.655 The Claimant contends that following the Claimant's establishment of the vertically integrated Weather Group in 2005, every entity in the chain had standing to submit claims against the Respondent arising out of the measures which the Respondent took starting in 2008.656\n\nC-PHB 1, paras. 172-173.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 91.\n\n447.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, where two entities in the same corporate chain bring parallel claims against the host state relating to the same measures, the only issue is the risk of double payment or recovery, which is not a bar to jurisdiction or admissibility.657 The Respondent's contrary assertion that the commencement of the OTH Arbitration deprived the remaining affiliates in the Weather Group of standing to bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent is unsupported by legal authority. To the contrary, investment tribunals confirm that indirect shareholders have standing to start arbitration against the host state, even if other entities in the same corporate chain have commenced separate proceedings relating to the same unlawful measures.658\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 176.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 93.\n\n448.\n\nIn the absence of limitations in the BIT restricting an indirect investor's right to pursue arbitration against the host state, the commencement of the OTH Arbitration lacks any relevance for purposes of jurisdiction and admissibility in the present proceedings.659\n\nC-PHB 1, paras. 176-177.\n\n449.\n\nFinally, the Claimant challenges the Respondent's reliance on the doctrine of abuse of rights. For the Claimant, this doctrine applies to situations where a company was incorporated after the dispute arose and similar circumstances. Here, the Claimant was incorporated and acquired its indirect controlling shareholding in OTA in 2005 - approximately three years before the Respondent's unlawful measures. Hence, there is no basis to argue that the exercise of the Claimant's right under the BIT to start arbitration constitutes an abuse of rights.660\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 178; C-PHB 2, para. 94.\n\n450.\n\nMoreover, even assuming *arguendo* that the doctrine of abuse of rights could apply in the context of parallel proceedings relating to the same unlawful measures, investment treaty tribunals have repeatedly held that there must be extraordinary circumstances to justify a denial of treaty rights under such doctrine.661 Where two claimants with related economic interests are not under common control, their insistence on conducting separate proceedings cannot *per se* constitute an abuse of process.662 In this case, the Claimant and OTH were not in a position to assert their respective claims against the Respondent in the same proceedings, because the Claimant did not own or control OTH when OTH commenced arbitration against the Respondent.663 Indeed, so the Claimant argues, it could not bring its claims lower in the chain, much less at the OTH level, because it had to sell the entire Weather Group as a result of the Respondent\u2019s unlawful measures.664\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 95.\n\nC-PHB 2, para. 96, discussing Wehland, *The Coordination of Multiple Proceedings in Investment Treaty Arbitration*, Exh.

The Settlement of the OTH Arbitration is irrelevant to jurisdiction and admissibility**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n451.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the settlement of the OTH Arbitration does not dispose of its claims in this arbitration.\n\n452.\n\nFirst, the Claimant contends that no action taken by either Party after the Request for Arbitration can deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction or render the claim inadmissible.665 Citing to *Vivendi II v. Argentina*, *CSOB v. Slovak Republic* as well as ICJ decisions, it maintains that jurisdiction must be determined by reference to the date on which judicial proceedings are instituted and that events taking place after that date do not affect a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.666 Thus, any action by Algeria subsequent to the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration of 12 October 2012 cannot deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction over the present claims or render those claims inadmissible.667\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 117-120.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 117-120, discussing *Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas Del Aconquija S.A. & Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

Indeed, assuming that OTH had not agreed to withdraw its claim from arbitration and that the PCA tribunal had rendered an award in favor of OTH, that decision would have carried no *res judicata* with respect to the Claimant's claims and, consequently, would have no effect on the Tribunal's jurisdiction or on the inadmissibility of OTMTI's claims.669\n\nRejoinder, paras. 275-284.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 122.\n\n454.\n\nIndeed, in the Claimant's opinion, the three conditions for *res judicata,* i.e. identity of parties, identity of subject matter or relief sought, and identity of legal grounds or causes of actions, are not satisfied. There is no identity of parties, as the Claimant is not a party to either the OTH Arbitration or the Settlement Agreement, and Algeria is not a party to the Settlement Agreement. There is no identity in the relief sought, as the relief sought in the PCA Arbitration was in excess of US$ 16 billion, whereas approximately US$ 4 billion is sought by OTMTI in this arbitration. Moreover, OTMTI seeks relief for losses that are unique to itself, i.e. the loss it suffered from having to sell its shares in OTA (via a sale of Weather Investments) at a depressed price due to Algeria's measures and the consequential losses it incurred as a result of having to refinance due to Algeria's measures. Finally, there is no identity of causes of action, as the OTH Arbitration involves a dispute under the Egypt-Algeria BIT, while this arbitration arises under the BLEU-Algeria BIT.670\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 123.\n\n455.\n\nFor the Claimant, the Respondent's invocation of *Azpetrol v. Azerbaijan* is inapposite, because in that case the *parties to the arbitration* entered into settlement negotiations. In that context, the tribunal reviewed the communications between the parties following the adjournment of the proceedings, and found that the respondent had made an offer of settlement which was \"unequivocally accepted\" by the claimants and that both parties \"were bound by the settlement agreement and neither side was free to withdraw\".671 Unlike in that case, Algeria never submitted a settlement offer to the Claimant and the Claimant never accepted any such offer.672\n\nRejoinder, para. 280, discussing *Azpetrol Int'l Holdings B.V., Azpetrol Group B.V. and Azpetrol Oil Services Group B.V. v. The Republic of Azerbaijan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/15, Award, 8 September 2009, Exh. RL-233, para. 101.\n\nRejoinder, para. 280.\n\n456.\n\nFurther, contrary to the situation in *SAUR v. Argentina,* where the claimant owned a controlling interest in the local company that concluded a settlement agreement with the Argentinian authorities, the Claimant here sold its indirect controlling interest in OTH to VimpelCom three years before VimpelCom, OTH, and the FNI concluded the SPA.673 In this context, the Claimant alleges that (i) it owned less than one percent of the share capital of OTH and VimpelCom at the time of the SPA; (ii) it did not own any shares in VimpelCom and owned less than one percent of OTH's share capital on 30 January 2015 when the FNI's share purchase of OTA's shares from VimpelCom and OTH closed, and on 12 March 2015 when the PCA tribunal issued the consent award terminating the OTH Arbitration.674 Contrary to the claimant in *SAUR*, OTMTI therefore did not obtain and could not have obtained compensation from the share purchase transaction.675\n\nRejoinder, para. 282.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 282, 290.\n\nRejoinder, para. 282. The Claimant further argues that the Respondent did not rely on any legal doctrine such as *res judicata* or collateral estoppel, as those doctrines are clearly inapplicable. See Rejoinder, paras. 285-292.\n\n457.\n\nIn fact, the Claimant contends that it notified the Respondent in its Notice of Dispute that it would not be bound by any settlement discussions between OTA, OTH, OTH\u2019s shareholders, and the Respondent.676 Subsequently it again notified the Respondent on 15 May 2012 that \"Weather II is broadly aware that there are ongoing negotiations between Algeria and at least some of OTA\u2019s shareholders (not including Weather II) in relation to the forced sale of OTA\", but that \"these negotiations do not involve, nor do they bind, Weather II\".677 The Respondent thus knew that its settlement discussions with OTH and VimpelCom would not bind the Claimant or have any effect on the latter\u2019s claims more than two years before the conclusion of the SPA.678\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 183.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 184, discussing Letter from Claimant to Respondent, 15 May 2012, Exh. C-344, at 2.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 184; C-PHB 2, para. 105.\n\n458.\n\nThird, there is no risk of double payment. As a preliminary matter, the Claimant submits that the risk of double recovery is not a bar to jurisdiction or admissibility, but is a matter for the merits, if at all relevant.679\n\nRejoinder, paras. 293-295; C-PHB 1, para. 190.\n\n459.\n\nAssuming *arguendo* that the risk of double payment or recovery could affect the admissibility of the claims, the Claimant contends that the loss it suffered is distinct from the one which OTH incurred, with the result that there can be no double payment or recovery. For the Claimant, the Respondent caused it to suffer damages of more than US$ 4 billion, which were not incurred by OTH. At the Hearing, the Respondent did not dispute that OTH did not claim compensation for refinancing costs that the Claimant was compelled to incur as a consequence of the Respondent\u2019s unlawful measures, or for payments that the Claimant made to private equity investors following the forced sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom.680 Additionally, OTH did not sustain any loss from the collapse of the MTN deal or the resulting sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, because OTH was part of the company that was for sale.681 Moreover, the non-payment of dividends was also, so the Claimant\u2019s expert Ms. Hardin confirmed, \"a damage that was incurred only by the Claimant, who had - based on its membership on the board of directors of OTH and its role as the controlling shareholder - the ability to require a disbursement, at a minimum, of its share of dividends from OTH that were paid up from OTA\".682 It is thus undisputed that \"at least part\" of the losses for which the Claimant seeks compensation in this arbitration were not sustained by OTH and, consequently, raise no concern with respect to double payment or double recovery.683\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 191.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 192.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 193.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 191. See also C-PHB 2, para. 108 (\"at least some of Claimant's claimed losses were not sustained by OTH\").\n\n460.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant alleges that Algeria never made any payment to the Claimant to compensate the harm that the latter suffered as a result of the unlawful measures. The Respondent did not compensate the Claimant by purchasing shares of OTA from VimpelCom, which in fact benefited from the unlawful measures that forced the Claimant to sell its indirect controlling shareholding in OTA at a significantly impaired price.684 In reality, the Respondent never compensated any party for the harm inflicted through its unlawful measures. This is confirmed by the SPA, which does not purport to provide compensation for the Respondent's unlawful measures, but \"sets forth the terms and conditions of the sale of 51% of the OTA shares by GTH to the FNI (the \u2018Transaction')\", and specifies that the SPA was \"concluded with no admission of guilt or liability with respect to the claims that are waived by GTH and the Algerian State\".685\n\nRejoinder, para. 296.\n\nRejoinder, para. 296, discussing Share Purchase Agreement, 18 April 2014, Exh. R-266, Recital J, Art. 7.4(b).\n\n461.\n\nNeither did Algeria make any payment to acquire the FNI's majority shareholding in OTA as it arises in particular from Ms. Hardin's evidence. In fact, the Respondent retained US$ 986 million in unlawful tax reassessments and penalties that it seized from OTA in 2010 and 2011 (which the Claimant values at US$ 1,356 billion taking into account the time value of money); it also obtained payment from OTA of US$ 1.1 billion in unwarranted foreign exchange fines; and received approximately US$ 774 million in capital gains, withholding, and transfer taxes.686 Thus, the Claimant submits that while the Respondent purportedly purchased OTA's shares for US$ 2,643 billion, it in fact received a net inflow of cash totaling US$ 564 million to acquire shares worth US$ 5,172 billion prior to the Respondent's unlawful measures. In other words, \"the Algerian Government acquir[ed] a 51 percent stake in an entity worth $5,172 billion as at 15 April 2011 for essentially nothing\"687 and there can therefore be no question of double recovery. For the Claimant, Ms. Hardin's analysis of the economic terms of the SPA stands unrebutted.688\n\nRejoinder, para. 297. See also Counter-Memorial, paras. 127-132.\n\nHardin Third Report, para. 2.2.6.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 195.\n\n462.\n\nFourth and last, the Claimant insists that not a single tribunal has dismissed a claim on the basis that a shareholder was entitled to claim only for so-called \"direct\" losses.689 Citing to *Bogdanov v. Moldova*, the Claimant submits that a shareholder's claim is not limited to the damage directly affecting his or her rights as shareholder, but extends to losses affecting the assets of the local company.690\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 139.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 138, discussing *Iuni Bogdanov, Agurdino-Invest Ltd. and Agurdino-Chimia JSC v. Republic of Moldova*, SCC Arbitration, Award, 22 September 2005, Exh. CLA-146, para. 5.1.\n\n463.\n\nBecause the Claimant, by virtue of its indirect controlling shareholding in OTA, qualifies as an \"investor\" with \"investments\" under both the BIT and ICSID Convention, it may recover for any damage suffered by its investment on account of Algeria\u2019s breaches of its obligations under the BIT. All of the Claimant\u2019s claims, including any claims \"based on the alleged injury suffered by OTA and its direct shareholder OTH\" are therefore admissible.691\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 140.\n\n**3. Jurisdiction and admissibility objections in relation to the Claimant's sale of its investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n464.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Algeria\u2019s offer to arbitrate was not addressed to the Claimant at the time of the Request for Arbitration, as the Claimant no longer held its investment (i). Furthermore, the claims are inadmissible as the Claimant sold or waived its right to bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent when it sold its investment to VimpelCom (ii).\n\n**i. Algeria's offer to arbitrate was not addressed to the Claimant at the time of the Request for Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nFor the Respondent, it is undisputed that the Claimant purported to accept Algeria\u2019s offer to arbitrate contained in the BIT when filing its Request for Arbitration of 19 October 2012.692 However, at that time, the Claimant held a \"very indirect\" interest in OTA which was equivalent to 0,025% of the share capital, because it had sold almost all of its shares in VimpelCom between February and September 2012. As it does not present the sale of its shares to VimpelCom as a forced sale resulting from Algeria\u2019s allegedly unlawful measures, the Claimant must establish that it was still holding an investment at the time when it accepted the offer to arbitrate under the BIT.693 Because of its marginal shareholding in OTA at the time of the Request for Arbitration, the BIT\u2019s offer to arbitrate was no longer addressed to the Claimant (*\"elle ne lui \u00e9tait plus adress\u00e9e\"*), which could therefore not accept it.694 As a consequence, the Tribunal must decline jurisdiction due to the Claimant\u2019s lack of consent to arbitrate.695\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 82-84.\n\nR-PHB 1, paras. 85-86; R-PHB 2, para. 69.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 86; R-PHB 2, para. 69.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 87; R-PHB 2, para. 70.\n\n466.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute that a claimant must be an investor at the time of the impugned acts. However, in order to benefit from the offer to arbitrate extended by Algeria, the Claimant had to hold an investment at the time when it was in a position to accept the offer pursuant to the Treaty (*\"au moment o\u00f9 elle [la D\u00e9fenderesse] \u00e9tait en mesure d'accepter ladite offre selon les termes de l'Accord\"*).696\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 67.\n\n467.\n\nFor the Respondent, decisions discussing the requirement that the investor hold the investment at the time of the request for arbitration suggest that such requirement may only be dispensed with in the event of a forced sale or expropriation of the investment.697\n\nR-PHB 1, fn. 221, discussing *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, NAFTA, Award, 11 October 2002, Exh. CLA-118, para. 91; *El Paso Energy Int'l Co. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006, Exh. CLA-37, para. 135; *National Grid plc v. The Argentine Republic*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction, 20 June 2006, Exh. CLA-188, para. 120. The Respondent argues that in *Daimler*, which in the Respondent's view is the only case cited by the Claimant where a tribunal was faced with a situation where the investment had been sold before the start of the arbitration, the tribunal did not rule on the effects of such sale on the parties' consent. See R-PHB 1, fn. 224, and R-PHB 2, fn. 116, discussing *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award, 22 August 2012, Exh. CLA-158, paras. 133 and 145.\n\n468.\n\nFrom a procedural point of view, the Respondent considers that this jurisdictional objection is timely. Indeed, the Respondent had stated on several occasions in its briefs that the Claimant had sold almost the entirety of its indirect interest in OTA on the date of the Request for Arbitration.698 It is also timely because at the Hearing the Tribunal invited the Parties to address the effect of the Claimant's residual stake in VimpelCom (0,025%) at the time of the Request for Arbitration.699\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 64.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 65, referring to Tr. Day 4 (Tribunal's Questions), 198-199. See esp. 198:10-12 (where the Tribunal discusses the question of the \"incidence of the remaining marginal participation of Weather II in VimpelCom at the time of the Request for Arbitration\").\n\n469.\n\nAlternatively, Algeria argues that by deciding to sell virtually all of its shares to VimpelCom before 19 October 2012, the day of the Request for Arbitration in this arbitration, the Claimant lost any standing (*qualit\u00e9 pour agir*) to proceed against Algeria.700\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 205; R-PHB 2, para. 125.\n\n**ii. Whether the Claimant sold or waived its right to bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n470.\n\nIt is the Respondent's submission that the Claimant sold its right to bring arbitration proceedings (*droit d'agir*) against Algeria when it sold its investment to VimpelCom. When a shareholder relies on an investment consisting of an indirect participation in a local company, the sale of that participation may, depending on the circumstances, entail the sale of the right to bring arbitration proceedings.701 The sale of the right to arbitrate may cause the inadmissibility of the claims.702 In this context, the Respondent cites to *El Paso*, according to which \"the claim continues to exist, i.e., the right to demand compensation for the injury suffered at the hands of the State remains - unless, of course, it can be shown that it was sold with the investment\".703 In other words, at the time of the sale, the Claimant had lost its right to bring proceedings against Algeria (as a result of OTH\u2019s exercise of such right). Under such circumstances, the sales transaction could not revive a right that had ceased to exist.704\n\nReply, para. 410.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 197.\n\nReply, para. 412, citing to *El Paso Energy Int'l Co. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006, Exh. CLA-37, para. 135.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 202; R-PHB 2, para. 122.\n\n471.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, when the indirect shareholder in a chain of vertically integrated companies - which has lost its standing to bring arbitration because one of its subsidiaries has exercised such right705 - sells its shares in the company which has started arbitration, that seller may contractually reserve for itself the benefit of the claim exercised by its subsidiary.706 Unless it does so, the claim exercised by the subsidiary will inure to the benefit of the buyer of the shares.707\n\nSee *supra* V.D.2.a.ii.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 199.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 199.\n\n472.\n\nFrom an economic point of view, the Respondent argues that on 2 November 2010, the date of OTH\u2019s Notice of Dispute, OTH\u2019s assets comprised the claims for damages against Algeria which claims increased the value of OTH. In other words, the price for the acquisition of OTH paid by VimpelCom to Weather Investments reflected the value of the damage claims.708 For the Respondent, Mr. Sawiris admitted as much at the Hearing.709\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 201; R-PHB 2, para. 124.\n\nR-PHB 2, para. 124, discussing Tr. Day 2 (Sawiris Cross), at 170:3-14.\n\n473.\n\nFinally, the Respondent notes that the Claimant has failed to produce the documents relating to the 2011 sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, which would allow the Respondent and the Tribunal to determine whether the Claimant has sold or waived its right to arbitrate against Algeria.710 In particular, the Respondent complains that the Claimant refused to produce the minutes of the Board meetings of VimpelCom711 and requests that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences from that refusal.712 The Respondent further observes that the SPA does not reserve the Claimant\u2019s claims for damages vis-\u00e0-vis Algeria and that the Algeria Risk Sharing Agreement did not do so either.713 As a consequence, the sale of Weather Investments necessarily entailed the transfer to VimpelCom of the claim for damages exercised by OTH.714 The Respondent also stresses that the Claimant acknowledged the absence of any injury suffered at the time of the closing,715 and subsequently omitted mentioning a damage in the Notice of Dispute of 16 April 2012.716\n\nReply, paras. 414-417.\n\nReply, para. 416.\n\nReply, para. 418.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 203.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 204.\n\nReply, para. 420.\n\nReply, para. 422.\n\n474.\n\nIn conclusion, it is the Respondent\u2019s case that, even if the Claimant had not lost its right to start arbitration as a result of OTH\u2019s exercise of such right, it has lost it as a result of the sale of its investment to VimpelCom. This is especially so in the absence of harm specific to the Claimant,717 a matter which the Respondent has developed in connection with the relevance of the Settlement Agreement.\n\nR-PHB 1, para. 206.\n\nb. **The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n475.\n\nFor the Claimant, the sale of the investment to VimpelCom does not deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction (i). Furthermore, the claims are admissible as the Claimant neither waived nor sold its right to bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent when selling its investment to VimpelCom (ii).\n\n**i. The sale of the Claimant's investment does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nAs a procedural matter, the Claimant considers the objection grounded on lack of jurisdiction because its indirect shareholding in OTA at the time of the Request for Arbitration was only 0.05% as untimely. Indeed, it was raised for the first time at the Hearing in violation of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which require that a jurisdictional objection be raised at the latest at the time of the counter-memorial.718\n\nC-PHB 1, paras. 154-155.\n\n477.\n\nOn the merits, the Claimant views the objection as meritless. The relevant time to assess whether there is a protected investment is the time of the treaty breach, at which time the Claimant was holding its investment.719 In the Claimant's opinion, an investor need not maintain ownership of its investment until it submits its claim to arbitration: were it otherwise, no claimant could submit a claim to arbitration where the respondent state nationalized or directly expropriated the claimant's investment.720 In any event, the Claimant alleges that it sold its investment as a direct result of the Respondent's measures.721\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 156\n\nC-PHB 1, paras. 156-157; C-PHB 2, para. 75, discussing *EnCana Corp. v.

The Claimant neither waived nor sold its right to bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n478.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Algeria has failed to proffer any evidence to support the erroneous speculation that the Claimant sold its right to bring proceedings against Algeria or waived its right to claim compensation for any damages that it has incurred.722\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 135; Rejoinder, paras. 264-265; C-PHB 1, para. 160; C-PHB 2, paras. 99-100.\n\n479.\n\nTo the contrary, so says the Claimant, it has demonstrated that it never sold or waived its right to initiate arbitration against the Respondent, and expressly retained that right in the Risk Sharing Agreement that the Claimant and VimpelCom concluded on 15 April 2011.723 In the Risk Sharing Agreement, the Claimant and VimpelCom agreed that both parties may bring legal proceedings against the Respondent.724 It is clear that, in such a scenario, the Claimant would bring claims for the harm that it already had suffered from the Respondent\u2019s unlawful measures, whereas VimpelCom or one of its privies would bring claims for harm that \"may result\" from actions that the Respondent had \"threatened\".725\n\nRejoinder, paras. 110, 266, discussing Algerian Risk Sharing Agreement by and between VimpelCom and Weather II, 15 April 2011, Exh.

Doing so would have been impermissible treaty shopping, because VimpelCom did not have any investment in Algeria at the time of the Respondent\u2019s unlawful measures and thus would lack standing to file treaty claims relating to those measures.729\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 161.\n\n482.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant considers the Respondent\u2019s speculation that the Claimant\u2019s sale\u2019s price to VimpelCom reflected the value of OTH\u2019s claims against the Respondent totaling US$ 15 billion to be ill-conceived. The payment that the Claimant received clearly did not include the value of OTH\u2019s US$ 15 billion claim or otherwise remedy the billion-dollar harm that the Claimant had incurred as a result of the Respondent\u2019s measures.730\n\nC-PHB 1, paras. 163-164; C-PHB 2, paras. 100-101.\n\n483.\n\nThe Claimant also highlights that several investment tribunals have confirmed that an investor\u2019s choice to dispose of its investment does not amount to a waiver of the right to initiate arbitration against the state and is irrelevant to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over claims deriving from the state\u2019s measures prior to such disposition.731\n\nRejoinder, para. 269, discussing *El Paso Energy Int'l Co. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 April 2006, Exh.

CLA-188, para. 43.\n\n484.\n\nFinally, in connection with the Respondent's requests that adverse inferences be drawn against the Claimant, the latter argues that it has produced all responsive documents relating to the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, the acquisition of shares of VimpelCom, and the subsequent sale of those shares.732 The Claimant, however, alleges that it has no possession, custody, or control of VimpelCom Board minutes, because it never had a seat on that board.733 Rather, the fact that the Respondent did not obtain these minutes, despite VimpelCom's undertaking to \"provide reasonable assistance\" to Algeria in this arbitration, confirms that no minutes exist and that the Claimant retained its right to bring these arbitration proceedings against the Respondent.734\n\nRejoinder, para. 271.\n\nRejoinder, para. 271.\n\nRejoinder, para. 273.\n\n**4. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**a. The main events underlying the dispute, the various Notices of Dispute and the relevance of the OTH Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n485.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it convenient to start by setting out the timeline of the main events relevant to the objections discussed in this section V.D, which assists in understanding the issues.\n\na. The Claimant was incorporated in 2005 and, as detailed above in the context of the discussion of jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, started to acquire its investment that year.\n\nb. The disputed measures taken by Algeria date back to the years 2008 to 2011. By way of example, the tax assessments against OTA were issued between the end of 2008 and early 2011; the dividend restrictions vis-\u00e0-vis OTA were enacted between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2010; and the Bank of Algeria's injunction restraining Algerian banks from engaging in foreign banking transactions on behalf of OTA was issued on 15 April 2010.\n\nc. On 2 November 2010, OTH notified Algeria of a dispute under the Egypt-Algeria BIT through a formal \"Notice of Dispute\" which triggered the 6-month waiting period under Article 7 of that treaty (the \"OTH Notice of Dispute\").735 The OTH Notice of Dispute was signed by Mr. Sawiris as Executive Chairman of OTH.736\n\nd. Less than a week later, on 8 November 2010, Weather Investments notified Algeria of a dispute under the Italy-Algeria BIT through a formal \"Notice of Dispute\", which triggered the 6-month waiting period under Article 7 of that treaty (the \"Weather Investments Notice of Dispute\").737 The Weather Investments Notice of Dispute was also signed by Mr. Sawiris as representative of Weather Investments.738\n\ne. On 15 April 2011, the Claimant completed the sale of OTA to VimpelCom (through the sale of Weather Investments).739 The Tribunal understands that between 2011 and 2012, the Claimant held a residual indirect participation in OTA of around 9.4% (through ownership of shares in VimpelCom).740\n\nf. On 12 April 2012, OTH followed up on the OTH Notice of Dispute by filing a Notice of Arbitration against Algeria under the UNCITRAL Rules and the Egypt-Algeria BIT (the \"OTH Arbitration\").741\n\ng. Two days later, on 14 April 2012, the Claimant in this arbitration notified Algeria of a dispute under the BLEU-Algeria BIT through a formal \"Notice of Dispute\" which triggered the 6-month waiting period under Article 9 of that treaty (\"the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Dispute\").742 The Claimant\u2019s Notice of Dispute was signed by Mr. Sawiris as Chairman of OTMTI.\n\nh. On 19 October 2012, the Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration with ICSID under the BLEU-Algeria BIT, thus following up on the Claimant\u2019s Notice of Dispute. The Tribunal understands that at that point in time the Claimant owned an indirect interest in OTA equivalent to 0,025%.743\n\ni. On 18 April 2014, the FNI, OTH and VimpelCom entered into an SPA, providing *inter alia* for the settlement of the OTH Arbitration.744\n\nj. On 15 March 2015, the PCA tribunal in the OTH Arbitration recorded the parties\u2019 settlement in a consent award.745\n\nLetter from OTH to Algeria, 2 November 2010, Exh.

While the companies giving notice and the investment treaties invoked are different, it is notable that the three notices concern the same measures or events.\n\n487.\n\nThe following chart highlights the main passages from the three notifications of dispute:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **OTH Notice of Dispute** **746** **(2 November 2010)** | **Weather Investments Notice of Dispute** **747** **(8 November 2010)** | **Claimant's Notice of Dispute** **748** **(16 April 2012)** |\n| Subject: Orascom Telecom Algerie S.P.A.

(\"Djezzy\") [...] |\n| We write with considerable alarm at recent developments in Algeria in relation to Djezzy [...]. In particular, many of the incidents of mistreatment since 2008 remain unresolved despite the fact that we have brought them to the Government's attention through numerous letters (see our correspondence to the Government dated 17 August 2009, 23 November 2009, 28 March 2010, 27 May 2010, 1 July 2010 and 8 September 2010). | Reference is made to past correspondence sent on behalf of Weather Investments S.p.A (\"Weather\") and related meetings, including, *inter alia*, [-] (9) the joint letter from Weather Investment S.a. r.l. and VimpelCom Ltd to you, dated 4 October 2010; and (10) the various letters, from Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (\"OTH\") to the Algerian Government, including OTH's letters of 28 March 2010 and 2 November 2010 [i.e. the OTH Notice of Dispute]. | We write to give you notice of an investment dispute between an investor and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria (Algeria). The investor is Weather Investments II S.a. r.l. (Weather II), a company incorporated in Luxembourg, hereinafter referred to as the Investor. The dispute arises out of certain measures taken by Algeria in breach of the protections provided to the Investor under the [BLEU-Algeria BIT]. The dispute relates to the Investor's significant investments in Djezzy, a company incorporated in Algeria, through the Investor's shareholdings in Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E. (OTH), a company incorporated in Egypt, which itself owns, directly or indirectly, 96.81% of the shares in Djezzy. As you are aware from the extensive previous correspondence with OTH and Djezzy, the dispute relates to an ongoing campaign of measures (the Measures) taken by Algeria in relation to Djezzy, |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **OTH Notice of Dispute** **746** **(2 November 2010)** | **Weather Investments Notice of Dispute** **747** **(8 November 2010)** | **Claimant's Notice of Dispute** **748** **(16 April 2012)** |\n|  |  | directly or indirectly, which have adversely affected - and continue to affect adversely- the Investor's investments in Algeria. These Measures were described in detail in past correspondence from OTH and its shareholders to Your Excellency, including, for example, in letters dated 2 November 2010 and 8 November 2010 [i.e. the OTH Notice of Dispute and the Weather Investments Notice of Dispute]. |\n| To recapitulate, these disputes concern a series of unlawful actions, including (amongst others, and without limitation): \u2022 the arbitrary injunction of 15 April 2010 by the Bank of Algeria restraining all Algerian banks from engaging in any foreign banking transactions on behalf of Djezzy [OTA], which has had devastating effects on both Djezzy and its shareholders (including, amongst others, the rapid deterioration of the network due to the inability to import essential goods); \u2022 the subsequent threat of massive fines proposed to be imposed on Djezzy as a result of groundless allegations that it breached Algerian foreign exchange regulations; \u2022 the imposition of arbitrary and unjustified tax reassessments and penalties on Djezzy for the years 2004 -2007 of more than USD 720 million; | We write to express our deep concern in relation to the issues summarised in the attached letter from OTH dated 2 November 2010 [i.e. the OTH Notice of Dispute]. The catalogue of arbitrary and unfair treatment that Djezzy and its shareholders have been subjected to are contrary to, *inter alia*, Articles 3. 4 and 5 of the [Italy-Algeria BIT]. These extreme actions have resulted in very serious losses to Weather and its shareholders. | As explained in that earlier correspondence, the Measures - all of which are unlawful, unjustified and arbitrary - include, but are not limited to: (a) the imposition of more than USD 950 million in unjustified tax reassessments and penalties on Djezzy for the years 2004-2009; (b) the blocking of Djezzy's payments of dividends to its foreign shareholders through the enactment of the Finance Act 2009 and the subsequent refusal to issue dividend transfer clearance certificates; (c) the failure to protect Djezzy during the football riots and violence against Djezzy's premises in November 2009; (d) the Bank of Algeria's injunction of 15 April 2010 (which remains in effect today), restraining all Algerian banks from engaging in any foreign banking transactions on behalf of Djezzy; |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **OTH Notice of Dispute** **746** **(2 November 2010)** | **Weather Investments Notice of Dispute** **747** **(8 November 2010)** | **Claimant's Notice of Dispute** **748** **(16 April 2012)** |\n| \u2022 the blocking of the payment of dividends to the foreign shareholders of Djezzy through the enactment of the 2009 Finance Act and subsequent refusal to issue clearance certificates, notwithstanding that all taxes, including the arbitrary and unfair taxes levied for those years, have been paid (subject to protest); \u2022 the arbitrary customs freeze on Djezzy's importation of goods, which is crippling its ability to acquire essential goods (such as SIM cards) and network equipment; \u2022 the interference in, and thwarting of, the sale of OTH to MTN (through, inter alia, the enactment (at the same time) of the 2009 Supplemental Finance Act); \u2022 the interference with the rights of OTH through the enactment of the 2010 Supplemental Finance Act to attempt to grant Algeria preemption rights over Djezzy in the event of a sale of OTH; \u2022 the arbitrary shutdown of Medcable and VSAT networks on spurious national security grounds; \u2022 the failure to protect Djezzy during the football riots and violence against Djezzy's premises in November 2009; \u2022 the disproportionate sanctions enacted in the 2010 Supplemental Finance Act which are plainly targeted at Djezzy; \u2022 the discriminatory ban on Djezzy |  | (e) the customs blockade imposed on Djezzy, preventing it from importing goods and network equipment essential to the maintenance and stability of its telecommunications network; (f) the recent imposition of a US$1.3 billion fine on Djezzy as a result of groundless allegations that it breached Algerian foreign exchange regulations, together with the threat of further massive fines to be imposed on Djezzy in the future; (g) the improper and unlawful targeting of Djezzy and OTH employees, including the initiation of a number of criminal investigations by the Bank of Algeria, and the recent improper and unlawful criminal sentence of imprisonment of an OTA senior executive, together with false allegations made to members of the Algerian press; (h) the interference in, and thwarting of, the sale of OTH to the MTN Group in 2010 through, inter alia, the enactment of the 2009 Supplemental Finance Act; (i) the interference with OTH's rights through the enactment of the 2010 Supplemental Finance Act in an attempt to grant Algeria pre-emption rights over Djezzy in the event of a sale of OTH; (j) the shutdown of the Medcable and VSAT networks on alleged national |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **OTH Notice of Dispute** **746** **(2 November 2010)** | **Weather Investments Notice of Dispute** **747** **(8 November 2010)** | **Claimant's Notice of Dispute** **748** **(16 April 2012)** |\n| advertising on Algerian state television; \u2022 the recent spurious criminal investigation initiated by the Bank of Algeria, including false allegations in the press and unfair targeting of OTH employees; \u2022 the unfair and arbitrary preliminary tax reassessment for the years 2008 and 2009 amounting to USD 230 million (following a tax audit initiated immediately after the tax filing for 2009 in March 2010); and \u2022 the Government's publicised intent to \"nationalise\" Djezzy and other press statements, with a view to, amongst others, derailing the transaction between VimpelCom Ltd and Weather Investments S.p.A. The above-described measures are contrary to, *inter alia*, Articles 3 and 6 of the Investment Agreement of 5 August 2001 and international law, including, *inter alia*, Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the [Egypt-Algeria BIT]. These extreme actions have already caused losses of several billion US dollars through the diminution in capital value of Djezzy and other losses resulting from the Government's unlawful conduct. These additional losses include, inter alia, hundreds of millions of dollars in costs incurred by Djezzy's shareholders when raising emergency funds to deal with the |  | security grounds; (k) the discriminatory ban on Djezzy advertising on Algerian State television; (l) the threat of unjustified sanctions as a result of the transaction between VimpelCom Ltd. and Wind Telecom S.p.A, concluded in mid-2011; (m) the blocking of Djezzy's commercial and marketing plans through: (i) refusal to approve its promotions and services; and (il) forcing Djezzy to withdraw certain services, offers or promotions; (n) discriminatory and preferential treatment of Djezzy's competitors; (o) conducting a campaign to discredit Djezzy and OTH in Algeria, and encouraging violence towards and mistrust in these companies, their employees and representatives; (p) ongoing unilateral and unlawful breaches of the 2001 Investment Agreement between OTH and the Algerian Investment Promotion, Support and Monitoring Agency; and (q) the culmination of this campaign by Algeria against Djezzy, being an unlawful attempted \"forced sale\" of all or part of Djezzy to the Algerian State or a State entity.[FN1] [FN1] We understand that OTH and at least some of OTH's shareholders agreed |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **OTH Notice of Dispute** **746** **(2 November 2010)** | **Weather Investments Notice of Dispute** **747** **(8 November 2010)** | **Claimant's Notice of Dispute** **748** **(16 April 2012)** |\n| DGE's unjustified tax reassessments and the Government's ban on dividend transfers out of Algeria. We draw your attention to the fact that the shareholders of OTH attempted to mitigate the losses through a sale to MTN, notwithstanding the fact that they did not wish to sell OTH or Djezzy but had no choice in light of the Government's unfair actions against OTH's investment. This distressed sale attempt had priced OTH's shareholding in Djezzy at no less than USD 7.8 billion, net of the wrongful tax reassessments, and already at a significant undervalue owing to the Government's prior unfair treatment, but such attempted mitigation was thwarted by the Government. As a result of the Government's interference, OTH and its shareholders have incurred significant losses, including, but not limited to, loss of opportunities. The Government's recent actions and public statements have also had a detrimental effect on OTH's share price, and have seriously impacted on OTH's and its shareholders' financial obligations.

We also understand that OTH has recently filed its own arbitration claim against Algeria, pursuant to the Egypt-Algeria bilateral investment treaty. For the avoidance of doubt, the past or future participation of OTH (and any of OTH's other direct or indirect shareholders) in the forced sale process was -and will remain -without prejudice to the rights of the Investor under the Treaty, including the Investor's right to have recourse to international arbitration if the dispute notified herein is not resolved within the six-month period of amicable negotiations referred to herein. Any offer, proposal, representation, heads of agreement, or agreement which may be exchanged or concluded between Algeria and OTH or Djezzy (or with any of OTH's other direct or indirect shareholders) shall not imply, nor shall it be interpreted as, a renunciation of any right of the Investor to have recourse to any national or international tribunal under Algerian and/or international law |\n| We have repeatedly sought to resolve this dispute amicably for more than one year.

R-13, p. 2 (referring to \" the issues summarised in the attached letter from OTH dated 2 November 2010 [i.e. the OTH Notice of Dispute]\").\n\n489.\n\nEach subsequent notice makes this identity of the dispute clear, as it defines the dispute *by reference to* the preceding notice(s). Thus, Weather Investments expressed its concern \"in relation to the issues summarised in the [OTH Notice of Dispute]\", which was attached to the Weather Investments Notice of Dispute. The Claimant's Notice of Dispute, for its part, referred to the dispute in the following terms: \" *the dispute relates to an ongoing campaign of measures (the Measures)* taken by Algeria in relation to Djezzy [OTA], directly or indirectly [\u2026]. *These Measures were described in detail* in past correspondence from OTH and its shareholders to Your Excellency, including, for example, *in [the OTH Notice of Dispute and the Weather Investments Notice of Dispute]* \".750 In other words, the reference to the description of the dispute contained in the OTH Notice of Dispute undoubtedly shows that both Weather Investments and, more importantly for these purposes, the Claimant considered the dispute to be one and the same.751\n\nThis was also confirmed by Mr. Sawiris at the Hearing:  \n [PROFESSOR GAILLARD]: So the dispute [in the Claimant's Notice of Dispute] is described by reference to earlier letters, right? Which I leave aside their characterisation as triggering letters or not. But that's the way you constructed the letter, right?  \n [MR SAWIRIS] Yes. Yes.  \n Tr. Day 2, 167:9-13.\n\nIn view of the identity of the dispute, it is unsurprising that the subsequent Request for Arbitration filed in this case presents similarities to the Notice of Arbitration in the OTH Arbitration, as is shown by Exh. R-54, Comparative analysis of arbitration applications filed by OTH and Weather II against the Algerian State.\n\n490.\n\nMoreover, the three notices were all sent by Mr. Sawiris. There is no controversy that at the time when the OTH and Weather Investments Notices of Dispute were sent, Mr. Sawiris and his family were the ultimate beneficial owners and Mr. Sawiris was the controlling shareholder of these companies.752 There is equally no dispute that the Weather Group constituted a vertically integrated chain of companies, in which the companies higher up in the chain controlled and directed the companies further down. As explained by Mr. Nasr, one of the Claimant's key witnesses in this arbitration, who since the creation of the Weather Group \"oversaw investments by Weather II and Weather Investments as Weather Investments' Corporate Finance Officer\":753\n\nFrom Weather II's creation forward, OTH and its subsidiaries, and Wind Italy and associated companies, were answerable to and controlled by Weather II. The operative entity on many matters was Weather Investment, which in turn was controlled by a majority of Board of Directors members appointed by Weather II. The managerial control exercised by the top of the Weather Group included, for instance, approval of OTH budgets and business plans, encompassing profit and dividend use, investment, and capital deployment. Operations in Algeria, including the ability to transfer dividends upstream, continued to be successful in the years following the creation of Weather Investments and Weather II.754\n\nSee e.g. Procedural Order No. 5, Annex A, Claimant's Redfern Schedule, Claimant's Comments, Request No. 4, p. 48 (describing Mr. Sawiris as the \"Claimant's controlling shareholder\").\n\nNasr Witness Statement, para. 37 (emphasis added).\n\nNasr Witness Statement, para. 37.\n\n491.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Claimant is equally clear in explaining the Weather Group's structure and Mr. Sawiris' role in it:\n\nThis control [of the Claimant over OTA] was \"manifested most fundamentally in voting the shares and in putting the parent company's people or team into place to operate the subsidiaries.\" For example, Mr. Naguib Sawiris was the Chairman of OTMTI's Board, was voted by OTMTI to be the Chair of the Weather Investments Board (as Algeria acknowledges), and maintained his positions as Chairman of OTA and Executive Chairman of OTH's Board after OTMTI's creation. OTMTI's control over OTA and the Weather Group is also clearly seen by its loss of control following the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, when Mr. Sawiris lost his chairmanships of both Weather Investments and OTH. Other employees of the Weather Group also were replaced following OTMTI's loss of control. It is thus very clear that \"OTMTI controlled OTA\".755\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 58.\n\n492.\n\nThus, from 2005 until the Claimant's sale of OTA through the sale of Weather Investments in April 2011, the Claimant asserts to have \"exercised its direct majority ownership to control Weather Investments, which similarly exercised its majority ownership in OTH (through wholly-owned subsidiaries) to control OTH, which exercised its majority ownership (directly and through wholly-owned subsidiaries) to control OTA\".756 As further confirmed by the Claimant's corporate finance expert Mr. Tolkien, from 2005 to 2011, \"at each link in the corporate chain, OTMTI or its subsidiaries owned at least 50% of the voting shares of the next company in the chain\".757\n\nRejoinder, para. 226.\n\nTolkien Second Report, para. 11.\n\n493.\n\nFor his part, at the Hearing, Mr. Sawiris explained his role in the Weather Group in the following terms:\n\n[W]hen I speak as Naguib, I speak for Weather II, for Weather and Orascom Telecom. I am the chairman across the board. So when I -- and I am the guy who is managing. I\u2019m not just a -- you know, and most of the time I was chairman and chief executive officer. So when I speak, I speak as a chairman of OTA, chairman of Weather; you can choose whatever position you want to think. But I am also a shareholder, and I represent my family\u2019s interests also. So I have -- I am like the general assembly, you know, because I own the 51% through my family, and I am the chairman and I am chief executive officer. So if you want to say *I'm everything*, it\u2019s true.758\n\nTr. Day 2, 84:20-85:8 (emphasis added).\n\n494.\n\nIn other words, there is no doubt that, at the time when the dispute described in the two first notices arose, the Claimant controlled OTH (and Weather Investments). There was no situation of separate boards deciding independently. When OTH and Weather Investments sent their notices of dispute, complaining that, as a result of Algeria\u2019s measures \"OTH *and its shareholders* have incurred significant losses\",759 that the Government actions had \"seriously impacted on OTH's *and its shareholders'* financial obligations\",760 and caused \"very serious losses to Weather and *its shareholders* \",761 those complaints were advanced by boards which \"were answerable to and controlled by [the Claimant]\".762\n\nOTH Notice of Dispute, Exh. C-24, p. 4 (emphasis added).\n\nOTH Notice of Dispute, Exh. C-24, p. 4 (emphasis added).\n\nWeather Investments Notice of Dispute, Exh. R-13, p. 2 (emphasis added).\n\nNasr, Witness Statement, para. 37.\n\n495.\n\nIn the vertically integrated chain that constituted the Weather Group, several entities could in theory at least bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent. OTA could rely on the ICSID clause in the Investment Agreement.763 OTH as direct foreign shareholders could invoke the arbitration clause in the Algeria-Egypt BIT. Weather Investments as indirect foreign shareholder could claim on the basis of the arbitration provision in the Algeria-Italy BIT. And the Claimant, another indirect foreign investor, could start arbitration based on the Algeria-BLEU BIT. In the case of the latter, the Treaty expressly affords protection to indirect shareholding, i.e. investment that can be held through one or more intermediate companies.764 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the existence of several legal foundations for arbitration does not necessarily mean that the various entities in the shareholder chain could make use of the existing arbitration clauses to assail the same measures and to recover the same economic loss under any circumstances. Indeed, the purpose of investment treaty arbitration is to grant full reparation for the injuries that a qualifying investor may have suffered as a result of a host state\u2019s wrongful measures. If the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration, the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral proceedings may become inadmissible depending on the circumstances.\n\nInvestment Agreement entered into on 5 August 2001 between OTH, Oratel (on behalf of OTA) and Algeria, and Executive Decree No. 01-416, 20 December 2001, published in the Official Journal of Algeria on 26 December 2001, including the full text of Investment Agreement, Exh. C-3, Art. 9.\n\nSee Article 1(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal may dispense with determining whether it is appropriate to fix a cut-off point beyond which an investor is \"too far removed\" to have a claim. Indeed, that determination would not change the outcome in view of the conclusion that the claims are inadmissible on other grounds.\n\n496.\n\nIn the circumstances of the present dispute, the Tribunal finds that the claims are inadmissible on several counts. In this framework, OTH's Notice of Dispute assumes a decisive importance, in itself and in combination with the subsequent events. On 2 November 2010, the Claimant and its controlling shareholder, Mr. Sawiris, caused the corporate organs of OTH to crystallize the dispute at the level of OTA's direct investor. To the Tribunal, that choice is unsurprising: OTH was the direct shareholder of OTA and was the entity that, up to that point in time, had always contested the measures.765 OTH was, moreover, the original investor which had been awarded the GSM License (for itself and on behalf of OTA)766 and had signed the Investment Agreement with the Algerian Government (in its name and on behalf of OTA).767\n\nSee, e.g., Letter from OTH to Minister of Industry and Investment, Algeria, 1 July 2009, Exh. C-104; Letter from OTH to Algerian Minister of Industry and Investment Development, 22 July 2009, Exh. C-652; Letter from OTH to Karim Djoudi, Algerian Minister of Finance, 17 August 2009, Exh. C-110; Letter from OTH to Algeria, 22 November 2009, Exh. C-11; Letter from OTH to Karim Djoudi, Algerian Minister of Finance, 28 March 2010, Exh. C-155; Letter from OTH to Karim Djoudi, Algerian Minister of Finance, 27 May 2010, Exh. C-19; Letter from OTH to Karim Djoudi, Algerian Minister of Finance, 1 July 2010, Exh. C-203; Letter from OTH to Algeria, 8 September 2010, Exh. C-20.\n\nGSM License and Executive Decree No. 01-219, dated 31 July 2001, Exh. C-2, Art. 1.\n\nInvestment Agreement entered into on 5 August 2001 between OTH, Oratel (on behalf of OTA) and Algeria, and Executive Decree No. 01-416, 20 December 2001, published in the Official Journal of Algeria on 26 December 2001, including the full text of Investment Agreement, Exh. C-3, p. 1.\n\n497.\n\nThus, on November 2, 2010, the legal protection that was available at the various levels of the corporate chain was activated at the OTH level. By exercising its right to arbitrate against Algeria, OTH placed itself in the position of being made whole for the alleged harm. Indeed, if it succeeded on the merits, the harm caused by the litigious measures would be remedied.\n\n498.\n\nTo the extent OTH would have restored its company value through arbitration proceedings under the BIT, all of the companies higher up in the corporate chain, including the Claimant, would have been made whole as well. Indeed, their loss depends on the diminution in value of their shares in OTH, which depends on the value of OTH (which in turn is a function of OTA's value). If the value of OTH is restored, then the shareholders of OTH suffer no loss, unless they incurred a loss of their own which is independent of the value of OTH.\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus review the losses that the Claimant alleges to have suffered as a result of Algeria's measures, with a view to examining whether the Claimant requests relief for losses that only itself suffered irrespective of the valuation of OTH. In this respect, OTMTI contends that \"at least part\" of the losses for which it seeks compensation in this arbitration were not sustained by OTH.768 In carrying out its analysis, the Tribunal has the benefit of the Claimant's full memorial on the merits, the three expert reports presented by the Claimant's expert on valuation and damages analysis (two of which were filed specifically in the bifurcated phase dealing with the Respondent's preliminary objections), the extensive discussion on these issues at the Hearing, including the cross-examination of the Claimant's expert, as well as the record of the OTH Arbitration which has been produced in this arbitration.\n\nC-PHB 1, para. 191. See also C-PHB 2, para. 108, where the Claimant asserts that \"at least some of Claimant's claimed losses were not sustained by OTH\".\n\n500.\n\nThe Claimant requests compensation for the following heads of damages. First, it claims \"compensation for its realized losses on the sale of its investment\".769 Second, it claims \"compensation for its share of the unlawfully blocked dividends\".770 Third, it claims damages due to payments made by the Claimant to private equity investors when it had to buy back shares in Weather Investments before selling Weather Investments to VimpelCom.771 Fourth, the Claimant claims \"compensation for consequential damages\".772 Fifth and last, at least initially, it also claimed moral damages.773 The Tribunal considers these categories of claims in turn.\n\nMemorial, paras. 408-419.\n\nIbid, paras. 420-421.\n\nIbid., para. 418.\n\nIbid., paras. 422-433.\n\nIbid., paras. 434-437.\n\n501.\n\nThe first category, the losses allegedly incurred on the sale of the investment, give rise to the Claimant's main claim. While the Claimant's Notice of Dispute did not contain any reference to the sale of its investment to VimpelCom at an alleged \"distressed price\", during the course of the proceedings the \"core of Claimant's case\" became \"that Respondent's measures caused Claimant to sell its interest in OTA to VimpelCom, which purchased OTA at an impaired price and, thus, benefitted from Respondent's unjust measures that had deeply reduced OTA's price\".774 The Claimant's expert refers to this category as the \"[d]amages due to a loss in value of OTA which crystallized when Claimant sold Weather Investments to VimpelCom on 15 April 2011\",775 and quantified them in an amount in excess of US$ 2,349 billion.776 As is clear from the Claimant's own pleadings and the testimony of its valuation and damages expert, this head of damage is based on the alleged diminution of value of OTA. For example, the Claimant asserts that:\n\nClaimant's loss crystalized when it sold its interests in OTA to VimpelCom\u2014along with a wide portfolio of other assets to make the acquisition of OTA manageable, from a risk perspective, to the buyer\u2014on 15 April 2011 and suffered a realized capital loss on its share of the investment amounting to approximately $2,349 billion. CRA [the Claimant's quantum expert] determined Claimant's compensable damage from this realized capital loss as Claimant's share of the difference between (i) the but-for value OTA would have had in the sale to VimpelCom, and (ii) the actual value OTA can be estimated to have carried in the sale to VimpelCom.\n\n[...]\n\nAccordingly, the total damages relating to OTA's loss in value, as reflected in the divesture sale of OTA is the difference between the but-for value of OTA ($10,142 billion) and its actual value ($3.6 billion)-i.e., $6,542 billion. At the time of the sale to VimpelCom, Claimant held 71.74% of Weather Investments, the entity (sold to VimpelCom) containing OTA and the accompanying portfolio of assets. Claimant also indirectly held 51.7% of OTH, which in turn held 96.81% of OTA. Accordingly, Claimant's total indirect interest in OTA at the time of divestiture was 35.91%. Claimant's damage relating to the loss in value of its indirect interest in OTA as a direct result of Algeria's unlawful measures thus amounts to $2,349 billion.777\n\nClaimant's Response to Respondent's Application for Bifurcation, 21 February 2014, p. 3. See also Memorial, para. 43 (\"Through this arbitration, Claimant now seeks full compensation for the substantial loss it incurred on the sale of its indirect interest in OTA to VimpelCom [\u2026]\").\n\nHardin Third Expert Report, para. 3.1.3.\n\nMemorial, para. 419.\n\nMemorial, paras. 411, 417 (internal footnotes omitted).\n\n502.\n\nThe interconnection between the damage relating to the allegedly impaired price at which the Claimant sold its investment and the alleged diminution of OTA's shareholding value is further explained by the Claimant in the following terms:\n\nIt was hardly surprising that the sales price obtained by Claimant for its controlling interest in OTA was billions of dollars less than it would have been had Algeria not taken the aforementioned series of unlawful acts against OTA. *In addition to the lost share value* *,* Claimant also suffered damages from Algeria's unlawful prohibition on OTA's repatriation of dividends. [\u2026]778\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, para. 3 (emphasis added).\n\n503.\n\nThe damages relating to the diminution in value of OTA were, in turn, also the main head of damages claimed by OTH in the OTH Arbitration. In the OTH Arbitration, OTH asked the tribunal to quantify \"the diminution in value of OTH's equity interest in OTA caused by the measures (i.e. the counter-factual value of OTH's equity interest as of the date of the Tribunal's award minus the actual value of that shareholding, if any, on that date)\".779 OTH claimed that its equity interest in OTA had been diminished as a consequence of the measures taken by Algeria against OTA (which, as seen above, are those of which the Claimant complains) and requested compensation in an amount between US$ 9.1 and 12.5 billion.780\n\nSee, e.g., OTH Statement of Claim, Exh. R-58, para. 480.\n\nOTH Statement of Claim, Exh. R-58, para. 488.\n\n504.\n\nThe examination of the Claimant's valuation and damages expert, Ms. Hardin, on the relationship of this head of damages claimed by the Claimant and those claimed by OTH was particularly enlightening:\n\n[PROFESSOR GAILLARD]. Can you take your third report [\u2026] here you note that OTH in the PCA arbitration is claiming for: \"The diminution in value of OTH's shareholding in OTA, which was described as the difference between the counter-factual value of OTH's equity interest in OTA and the residual value of that shareholding, which OTH claimed was zero...\" So I will focus on this value of zero. If as a matter of principles of finance and damage theory, if OTH is right that the value of its ownership in OTA is zero, it must mean that above it's also zero, if they are right; because if OTH has an interest in OTA, the Algerian company, which is zero, then the shareholder above has a value which indirectly is zero, and then the shareholder even more above has a value which is still zero. Right? [\u2026] if you are asked to assume that OTA, the company, is worth zero because of the measures -- but I am not asking you to take that as a fact; I am just asking you to take that as a hypothetical -- if it's worth zero, it must mean that the shareholding of OTH in OTA is worth zero; and that, as a result, any indirect shareholding above is worth zero as well, if you accept my premise. Right? [\u2026] And if that shareholding of OTH in OTA is worth zero, then anything above is worth zero as well, right? The indirect shareholding is -- it's axiomatic, isn't it? If the hypothetical is right, of course.\n\nA. The assumptions in this case are --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Can I try it a little bit differently.\n\nA. Yes, go ahead.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: If the value of OTA is zero, then the value held by OTH as shares of OTA is zero, right; or not?\n\nA. If you make an assumption --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, no, the assumption is very simple.\n\nA. The assumption is zero, that the value --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: The value of OTA shares is zero. Then how much value does OTH hold for the shares of OTA?\n\nA. If the value of OTA is zero, then the 36% holding of Weather Investments is zero, is also worth zero, if you're making that assumption, 100 --\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: So now you continue up the chain, and the value stays zero as you go up the chain; is that what you're saying? I think that's what I understood.\n\nA. Yes, I think that would be accurate.781\n\nTr. Day 4, 155:11-156:5; and 159:16-160:11.\n\n505.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the claim for damages \"for the Claimant's realized losses on the sale of its investment\" concerns the same economic harm as OTH's claim for diminution in value of its interest in OTA, which OTH raised in the OTH Arbitration.\n\n506.\n\nA second category of damages for which the Claimant requests relief in this arbitration relates to damages \"for the Claimant's share of the unlawfully blocked OTA dividends\".782 In this respect, the Claimant has argued that \"Algeria's obstruction of Claimant's right to transfer dividends from OTA to the Weather Group and other harmful measures are in breach of Algeria's obligations to Claimant under the BIT\".783 It thus asks the Tribunal to \"award Claimant its proportional share of dividends that OTA would have transferred upstream had Algeria not acted unlawfully\". It has quantified those damages at US$ 485.8 million.784 This category of damages was also claimed by OTH in the OTH Arbitration, where the claimant requested \"OTH's historical losses incurred as a result of the unlawful conduct up to the date of the Tribunal's award, (in the form of dividends wrongfully denied to OTH from 2009 onwards and other related losses)\".785\n\nMemorial, para. 420 et seq.\n\nMemorial, para. 420.\n\nMemorial, para. 421, discussing Hardin First Expert Report paras. 104-106.\n\nOTH Statement of Claim, R-58, para. 480. See also OTH Statement of Reply, Exh. R-301, para. 417.\n\n507.\n\nWithin a vertical chain of corporations, each entity may pay out dividends to its shareholder(s), namely to the company or companies at the immediate higher echelon in the chain. Thus, OTH would have received OTA dividends; Weather Capital would have received OTH's dividends; Weather Investments would have received Weather Capital's dividends; and the Claimant would have received Weather Investments' dividends. Absent Algeria's allegedly unlawful measures, the \"blocked OTA\" dividends would thus have been paid to OTH, and not to the Claimant. This notwithstanding, the Claimant's expert, Ms. Hardin, has argued that the damage relating to the unpaid dividends are \"a damage that was incurred only by the Claimant, who had - based on its membership on the board of directors of OTH and its role as the controlling shareholder - the ability to require a disbursement, at a minimum, of its share of dividends from OTH that were paid up from OTA\".786 According to Ms. Hardin, by contrast to the Claimant, \"OTH did not sustain damages due to OTA's withheld dividend payments because it did not have ultimate control of those payments\", based on the theory that \"a key difference in this claim stems from the point of view of a controlling versus non-controlling shareholder and the role of each type of shareholder for the company\".787\n\nHardin, Tr. Day 4, 141:6-11.\n\nHardin Third Expert Report, para. 3.2.15. See also Tr. Day 4, 163:2-9 (Hardin) (\"Weather II was the controlling shareholder. As the controlling shareholder [\u2026] it has the ability to have dividends distributed, have them remain to be used for operations. They control the distribution of that dividend and they are the beneficiary of that dividend. In the end, OTH doesn't necessarily keep that money unless the controlling shareholder allows it\").\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to follow this argument. It is undisputed that the Claimant itself was controlled by other companies, April, OS and Cylo, whose shareholders were certain trusts constituted to the benefit of Mr. Sawiris and his family.788 If one were to follow Ms. Hardin's theory, it would be those entities above the Claimant who would have had the ultimate decision-making power in relation to any dividend paid by companies further down in the chain. If this were so, then it would be the entities controlling the Claimant which suffered the damage; the Claimant - like OTH in the Claimant's theory - would have incurred no damage as it \"did not have ultimate control of those payments\" and would merely have transferred them upstream. The Claimant's and its expert's views that only the Claimant suffered harm as a result of the unpaid OTA dividends must thus be rejected. To the contrary, in the Tribunal's view, the Claimant's claims for damages in relation to the dividends are identical to, and necessarily contained in, OTH's claims in the OTH Arbitration. Absent Algeria's allegedly wrongful measures, any dividends would necessarily have been paid to the Claimant through OTH.\n\nSee in particular cross-examination of Mr. Sawiris, Tr. Day 2, 96 et seq.\n\n509.\n\nThird, the Claimant claims \"damages due to incremental payments that Claimant was obligated to pay to certain private equity investors [\u2026] because of the decrease in the value of Weather Investments, of which Claimant was the majority owner\".789 The Claimant contends that, in order to effect the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom, it had to acquire approximately 30% of the remaining shares of Weather investments from the company's other shareholders, as a result of change of control put options held by those other shareholders, and sell this stake to VimpelCom at a lesser value.\n\nHardin Third Expert Report, para. 3.1.3.\n\n510.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the claims in relation to this category of damages are inadmissible because these alleged losses derive primarily from the presence of put options in an agreement freely entered into by the Claimant. In addition, when the Claimant sold the Weather Group to VimpelCom (via the sale of Weather Investments), the sales price must or should have reflected any difference between the price paid by the Claimant to the Weather Investments minority shareholders and the final purchase price paid to the Claimant by VimpelCom.\n\n511.\n\nFourth, the Claimant seeks \"consequential damages\", which comprise a number of subcategories. In Ms. Hardin's words, these concern the Claimant's \"realized damages as a result of incurring various costs in order to refinance its capital structure and prevent a collapse of the Weather Group\".790 Here again, these claims are inadmissible on several grounds.\n\nHardin Third Expert Report, para. 3.2.19 et seq. See also Hardin First Expert Report, paras. 237 et seq.\n\n512.\n\nThe first ground is that the Claimant has not clearly alleged, let alone established, that it was the Claimant, as opposed to other entities of the Weather Group, including OTH and Weather Investments, which incurred these alleged losses.791 Indeed, Ms. Hardin's first financial and damages report, which discusses such \"consequential damages\" in greater detail,792 treats these losses as losses of Weather Investments and OTH, not the Claimant. With regard to Weather Investments, Ms. Hardin states for instance that \"[a]s a result of the lack of dividends from OTA to Weather Investments and the potential risk of loan defaults due to tax reassessments, *Weather Investments* had to undertake certain capital restructuring transactions\";793 that \" *Weather Investments* incurred significant transaction costs and incremental interest costs associated with restructuring transactions at OTH, WCF, WCSP1 and WAHF entities\";794 that \"in June of 2008, the [ *sic* ] *Weather Investments* retired EUR 646 million of the WCSP1 Collateralized Notes. Later on, in April of 2010 *Weather Investments* used proceeds from the PIK loan to retire additional EUR 150 million in principal\";795 and that \"[a]s part of the requirements for OTH to receive waivers from its lenders, [\u2026] *Weather Investments* participated in [the OTH] Rights Issuance in the amount of EUR 308.4 million\".796\n\nSee e.g. Memorial, paras. 422 et seq. (\"each injury described below *to the Weather Group*, of which Claimant was ultimate parent, is causally linked to Algeria's unlawful acts\" [\u2026] \"To avoid what in Karim Nasr's words would have been an \u2018instant inferno' *in the Weather Group*, *OTH* was compelled to obtain waivers from its financiers; without these waivers, OTH would be thrown into default\" [\u2026] \"WCSP1 [Weather Capital Special Purpose 1] *had* to participate in the OTH Rights Issue - otherwise, WCSP1 would have suffered an event of default and collateral call because the OTH shares it held would be worth substantially less after the OTH Rights Issue. To avoid its own default, WCSP1 had to participate in the OTH Rights Issue in the same proportion as its shareholding in OTH prior to the OTH Rights Issue\" [\u2026] \" *The Weather Group* had to finance its participation in the OTH Rights Issue [\u2026] \"CRA calculates the *damage associated with the Weather Group's participation* in the OTH Rights Issue to be $386.4 million\" [\u2026] \"Project Passat collapsed and *the Weather Group had to undertake Project Sunshine II*. Claimant refinanced a portion of the outstanding WCSP1 Collateralized Notes, \u20ac150 million, through Project Sunshine II, a portion that would have been refinanced through Project Passat (along with the entire outstanding amount of the WCSP1 Collateralized Notes)\".

More specifically, Ms. Hardin asserts that \"[i]n 2008 and 2009, the Algerian government prevented or delayed the transfer of dividends from OTA to OTH. During this period *OTH did not receive cash when it had anticipated it and was required to finance operations and financing payments obligations through bridge loans*. But for the Algerian Measures, OTH would not have taken these loans and would not have incurred resulting interest costs. OTH utilized two bridge loans totaling USD 500 million during 2008. Proceeds from these loans were used to cover cash shortfall due to delay in transfer of dividends from OTA to OTH. In 2009, as part of the Algerian Measures, the Algerian government allowed OTA to transfer only 50 percent of total dividends which should have been paid in 2008. *OTH entered in three bridge loans totaling USD 150 million during this period*. Proceeds from these loans were used to cover cash shortfall due to delay in transfer of dividends from OTA to OTH\" (ibid., paras. 253-255, internal footnotes omitted, emphasis added).\n\nHardin First Expert Report, para. 257 (emphasis added).\n\nHardin First Expert Report, para. 261 (emphasis added).\n\nHardin First Expert Report, para. 267 (emphasis added).\n\nHardin First Expert Report, para. 280 (emphasis added). See also ibid, para. 282 (adding that \"as part of the requirements of the second round of waivers obtained from the two OTH notes and the OTH Guaranty, in December 2009, OTH was required to sell its 50 percent interest in Orascom Telecom Tunisiana [OTT] and use the proceeds to pay down and cash collateralize the two OTH notes\", internal footnote omitted).\n\n514.\n\nNotably, in Ms. Hardin's third report, filed after the Respondent had raised its jurisdiction and admissibility objections, the wording in respect of these heads of damages changed to refer indistinctly to the \"Weather Group\".802\n\nSee, e.g., Hardin Third Expert Report, para. 3.2.21 (\"[i]n order to prevent a default of OTH, waivers needed to be obtained from OTH's creditors. To obtain waivers for OTH debt, *the Weather Group, on behalf of OTH*, was required to infuse equity capital into OTH by purchasing additional OTH shares (\u2018OTH Rights Issuance')\" [\u2026] \"To prevent such a collateral call, *the Weather Group, through OTH's immediate parent, WCSP1*, had no choice but to participate in the OTH Rights Issuance proportional to its ownership share\" (emphasis added) and para. 3.2.23 (\"OTH did not claim the same damages because the actions described previously were undertaken by OTMTI, *through the Weather Group*, to support OTH and prevent a collapse of the Weather Group\", emphasis added).\n\n515.\n\nIt is thus clear that consequential or refinancing losses, which may have been incurred as a result of Algeria's measures, were incurred by Weather Investments and OTH, and not by the Claimant. Mr. Sawiris himself, when writing on behalf of OTH to the Algerian Minister of Finance on 28 March 2010, confirmed that Algeria's tax reassessments and blockade of dividends had forced OTH to search for funds as substitution for dividend income and that \"[t]herefore, *OTH and its Italian parent company, Weather Investments*, have had to raise hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in interim funding at a significant cost\".803 In line with those statements, it is thus unsurprising that OTH made claims for financing losses and for costs relating to the waivers in the OTH Arbitration.804 To the extent those alleged losses were incurred by OTH, they cannot be (re)claimed in this arbitration for the reasons discussed above.\n\nLetter from OTH to Karim Djoudi, Algerian Minister of Finance, 28 March 2010, Exh. C-155, p. 2 (emphasis added).\n\nSee OTH Statement of Claim, Exh. R-58, para. 517, listing among the \"historical losses\" claimed by OTH the \"costs of waivers which OTH was required to obtain from its lenders as a result of the Tax Reassessments and the Injunction; and costs incurred by OTH in obtaining the SBLCs required to facilitate OTA's payment of the 2005-2007 Tax Reassessment in April 2010\". See also ibid., fn. 485.\n\n516.\n\nAs a second reason for inadmissibility, assuming for the sake of the discussion that the Claimant did sustain some of these losses \"to prevent a collapse of the Weather Group\", these losses must or should have been factored into the price when the Claimant sold Weather Investments (which was below the Claimant in the corporate chain and held the other companies forming the Weather Group) to VimpelCom. Indeed, assuming that the refinancing was necessary to avoid the collapse of the Weather Group, these recapitalization contributions increased the value of the group and thus of Weather Investments and such increase must or should have been reflected in the sale's price. This fact is also implicit in the Claimant's valuation and damages expert's statement that \"OTH was the beneficiary of the actions undertaken\" to prevent the alleged \"collapse of the Weather Group\".805 If OTH benefitted from the refinancing measures undertaken to prevent the alleged collapse of the group, then the value of OTH increased as a result and such increase must or should have been reflected when OTH was sold (via the sale of its parent company) to VimpelCom.\n\nSee Hardin Third Expert Report, para. 3.2.23.\n\n517.\n\nFifth and last, in its Memorial, the Claimant initially requested moral damages for alleged reputational losses, which were presented as \"subject to further quantification\".806 These damages were not addressed in the Claimant's subsequent briefs on jurisdiction and admissibility and were not discussed in the reports of the Claimant's damages expert. In particular, they do not appear in Ms. Hardin's third expert report in the section devoted to the \"damages that OTH did not sustain\".807 In the closing submissions at the Hearing, this category of damage was not further pursued either.808 Nonetheless, in the absence of a formal withdrawal of its initial requested relief, the Tribunal shall address the Claimant's claim for moral damages. The Tribunal finds this claim inadmissible for the following reason. The Claimant seeks to recover for reputational harm, if any, incurred either by OTH809 or by Mr. Sawiris and not by itself.810 In Mr. Sawiris' own words, the Claimant is a mere holding company which \"has the sole purpose of owning and having a legal state and a tax status\", whose activity \"does not require a website\", *inter alia* because it does not wish to attract any attention.811 Under these circumstances, the claim for moral damages must be deemed inadmissible.\n\nMemorial, para. 437\n\nSee Hardin Third Expert Report, pp. 31-42.\n\nTr. Day 5 (Menaker), 218:8-20 (\"we have shown that in any event our damages are distinct. Of the four heads of damages for which we have claimed, there's no dispute that the damages that we incurred from refinancing as a result of Algeria's measures, and the damages that we incurred as a result of the increased payments made to the private equity investors, were not incurred by OTH and were not claimed by OTH in its arbitration. As for the other two heads of damages, there is a dispute between the parties as to whether the damages that we claim as a result of the forced sale and for the loss of dividends, whether they are the same damages that OTH claimed in its arbitration\").\n\nSee Memorial on Merits, para. 437, referring to \"a highly successful telecommunications company renowned throughout the Middle East and in much of the developing world [...] an ethical and legitimate operator in the industry [,..][which] invested large amounts in Algeria when few foreign investors were willing to give the country a chance\", which considering the facts of the case and the history of the Weather Group's investments in Algeria unquestionably refers to OTH.\n\nSee Mr. Sawiris' complaint that Algeria's measures \"destroyed his dream\" (see *Le magnat des t\u00e9l\u00e9coms Naguib Sawiris attaque l\u2019Alg\u00e9rie - S\u2019estimant l\u00e9s\u00e9 dans la vente de Djeezy, l\u2019\u00c9gyptien r\u00e9clame 5 milliards de dollars de dommages \u00e0 Alger*, Le Figaro, 19 November 2012, Exh.

You know, you're only attracting the people you don't want to attract.\n\n518.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the Claimant's attempts to depict the damages claimed as compensation for harm caused to itself, as opposed to OTH, the claims before the Tribunal in reality seek reparation for losses covered by the requests for relief raised in the OTH Arbitration or for losses that the Claimant (owned and managed by an experienced businessman like Mr. Sawiris) must or should have factored into the sale of its investment to VimpelCom.

The settlement provides for the sale of 51% of OTA's shares to the FNI. In that context, the parties to the share purchase agreement also put an end to all disputes opposing OTA and OTH to Algeria.812 On 18 April 2014, the day of the signing of the settlement agreement, OTH and the Republic of Algeria suspended the OTH Arbitration pending the closing of the transaction, pursuant to Article 7.4(a) of the settlement agreement.813\n\nSee Share Purchase Agreement between OTH, VimpelCom and the FNI, 18 April 2014, Exh. R-266.\n\nJoint Letter from the Parties of 18 April 2014 to the Arbitral Tribunal in PCA Case No. 2012-20, Exh. R-59.\n\n520.\n\nSpecifically, the settlement agreement provides that at closing, OTA, OTH and Algeria would put an end to their disputes before the Algerian domestic courts and the OTH Arbitration. In particular:\n\na. Pursuant to Article 7.4(b) of the settlement agreement, \"all claims that have been raised in the [OTH] Arbitration by [OTH], on the one hand, and the Algerian State, on the other hand, have been finally settled; [OTH], on the one hand, and the Algerian State, on the other hand, waive definitively and irrevocably all claims that have been brought in the Arbitration and/or that could have been brought in the Arbitration as at the date of signing of this Agreement with respect to facts that formed the basis of the claims raised in the Arbitration [\u2026]\";\n\nb. Pursuant to Article 7.4(c) (entitled \"Bank of Algeria Dispute\"), OTH undertook to procure that OTA discontinue and waive all disputes before the Algerian courts in relation to alleged breaches of Algerian exchange regulations and the actions of the Bank of Algeria;\n\nc. Pursuant to Article 7.4(d) (entitled \"Tax Disputes\"), OTH undertook to procure that OTA discontinue and waive all disputes before the Algerian courts in relation to the tax reassessments.\n\n521.\n\nThe settlement further specifically addresses and resolves certain disputed issues also raised in this arbitration and discussed above, such as the distribution of the blocked OTA dividends. Thus, for example, the settlement provides as \" *condition suspensive* \" to the acquisition by the FNI of the majority of OTA's shares that OTA must effect a dividend distribution to its direct shareholders (amongst which OTH).814\n\nSee Share Purchase Agreement between OTH, VimpelCom and the FNI, 18 April 2014, Exh. R-266, Art. 8.1(c).\n\n522.\n\nAfter the closing of the share purchase (which occurred on 30 January 2015), OTA, OTH and Algeria finally put an end to the domestic courts and arbitral proceedings, waiving all their claims. In particular, OTA put an end to all disputes which it had with the Algerian authorities and withdrew on 31 January 2015 from the proceedings before the Algerian courts.815 On the same day, OTH and Algeria addressed the \"Renunciation Letter\" informing the PCA tribunal in the OTH Arbitration that they had \"finally settled their dispute referred to arbitration\" in that proceeding.816 On 12 March 2015, the PCA tribunal issued a consent award recording the above agreement between the parties, which put an end to the OTH Arbitration.817\n\nSee OTA's Memorial on the discontinuance of the proceeding before the Council of State, 28 January 2015, Exh. R-297; OTA's Memorial on withdrawal and renunciation to appeal, 29 January 2015, Exh. R-298.\n\nLetter of Renunciation Addressed to the Arbitral Tribunal in PCA Case No. 2012-20 on 31 January 2015, Exh. R-306.\n\nSee *Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, PCA Case No. 2012-20, Award on Agreed Terms, 12 March 2015, Exh. R-307.\n\n523.\n\nThere is no allegation by the Claimant that the settlement was made in suspicious circumstances (such as that it was forced by Algeria upon OTH or was entered into by OTH's board in collusion with Algeria). Moreover, it comes as no surprise that it was entered into, *inter alia*, by OTH who also undertook a number of obligations on behalf of OTA. As already mentioned, OTH was the \"historical\" controlling shareholder of OTA, to which the GSM License was granted in 2001 (in the name and on behalf of OTA)818 and which negotiated and concluded the Investment Agreement in 2001 (in the name and on behalf of OTA).819 Furthermore, it was OTH which in 2009-2010 objected to the measures taken vis-\u00e0-vis OTA and which sent the first Notice of Dispute on 2 November 2010. At all times, OTH was and remained the direct and controlling shareholder of OTA.820 For all of those reasons, it was thus entirely logical for Algeria to negotiate with that foreign investor in the vertically integrated chain of companies.\n\nGSM License and Executive Decree No. 01-219, dated 31 July 2001, Exh. C-2, Art. 1.\n\nInvestment Agreement entered into on 5 August 2001 between OTH, Oratel (on behalf of OTA) and Algeria, and Executive Decree No. 01-416, 20 December 2001, published in the Official Journal of Algeria on 26 December 2001, including the full text of Investment Agreement, Exh. C-3, p. 1.\n\nSee *Organigramme des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s,* R-1111.\n\n524.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Claimant cannot bring claims in this arbitration that OTH decided to settle, as the settlement clearly resolved the dispute that the Claimant has brought before this Tribunal as is shown by the comparison of the notices of disputes above. The existence of a settlement agreement does not change the Tribunal's conclusions in relation to the OTH Arbitration, as the settlement stands in lieu of the investment treaty tribunal's award which would have been forthcoming in that arbitration. The settlement agreement puts an end to the dispute arising from Algeria's measures in the same manner as the award would have ended the dispute. In the absence of harm which it incurred itself to the exclusion of OTH, the Claimant cannot take over the dispute that OTH has settled. In this respect, the content of the settlement, whether beneficial or detrimental to OTH/OTA, is irrelevant. What matters is that the claims arising from Algeria's measures have ceased to exist due to the settlement agreement.\n\n525.\n\nA contrary conclusion would lead to unreasonable results. Indeed, if, despite a valid settlement reached between the host state and the direct foreign shareholder of the local company affected by the disputed measures (also acting on behalf of the local company), an indirect shareholder could bring or continue separate investment claims in relation to the same facts and measures, a respondent state may well never settle a dispute amicably. Indeed, depending on the investment's ownership structure, it would face the risk that other shareholders, present and future, direct and indirect, involved in the dispute or not, could take over the settled dispute. In those circumstances, the provisions of investment treaties which invariably encourage the amicable settlement of a dispute between a state and foreign investors as a preliminary step to the commencement of arbitration proceedings,821 may well remain dead letter.\n\nSee for instance Egypt-Algeria BIT, Art. 7(1); Italy-Algeria, Art. 8(1); and BLEU-Algeria BIT, Exh. C-658, Art. 9(1).\n\n526.\n\nIn conclusion, the settlement agreement entered into between the Algerian FNI, OTH and VimpelCom confirms that the Claimant's claims are inadmissible.\n\n*c.* **The relevance of the sale of the Claimant's investment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the settlement agreement is not opposable to it, among other reasons because it sold its indirect controlling shareholding in OTH to VimpelCom three years before the settlement. The Tribunal cannot follow this argument. The fact that the Claimant sold its investment does not change the conclusions reached above. If anything, it reinforces them.\n\n528.\n\nFirst of all, in the event that the Claimant had decided to remain in control of its investment and OTH had been successful in the OTH Arbitration (a procedure that the Claimant caused OTH to put in motion by causing OTH to send the OTH Notice of Dispute), the Claimant would have had an award rendered in respect of OTH. In the same vein, it would have had the settlement agreement entered into by OTH. In the absence of harm it has suffered itself as opposed to OTH, any separate claims brought by the Claimant based on the same measures would have been inadmissible if it had remained in control of its investment. This being so, the sale of the investment cannot bestow on the seller more rights than it would have had if it had remained as a shareholder.\n\n529.\n\nSecond, when selling its investment, the Claimant could have carved out from the scope of the sale and reserved for itself the benefit of OTH's claim against Algeria. Absent such a carve out, the claim exercised by a subsidiary will benefit the buyer of the shares. In this case, by selling the shares in a company granting control over OTH (Weather Investments), the Claimant sold the claim that was attached to the shares in OTH.\n\n530.\n\nThis point was accepted by Mr. Sawiris at the Hearing:\n\nQ. So you accept that you didn't need to sell OTH's claim or OTA's claim when you sold the shares; it goes with the shares, right?\n\nA. Yes.822\n\nTr. Day 2, 173:16-19.\n\n531.\n\nMr. Sawiris also recognized that the price paid by the buyer must have included the claim to seek redress for Algeria's measures in relation to which OTH had already notified Algeria of a dispute:\n\nPROFESSOR GAILLARD: So as a businessman, if you sell a company which has a big claim in it, the company is worth more than if you sell the company with no claim in it, right?\n\nMR. SAWIRIS: Yes, of course.\n\nQ. Right. So in this particular case, you sold to VimpelCom a company -- or the shares giving control of a company, OTH, which had a big claim against Algeria; correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. And that, by necessity, has an impact on the price at which you sell the company; correct?\n\nA. Should be, yes.823\n\nTr. Day 2, 170:3-14.\n\n532.\n\nThe same fact was acknowledged by the Claimant's financial and damages expert, Ms. Hardin:\n\nPROFESSOR GAILLARD: And my next question, which is the question I'm asking now, is: when you sell the shares, just the shares -- with no contract, just the shares -- do you take into account when you value the company, as a matter of methodology, do you take into account the claims which exist in this company? Right? So it's a simple question; it can be answered by yes or no.\n\nA. No, it can't, actually.\n\nQ. I'm not going to ask you to evaluate a company like this, which we don't know anything about. As a matter of methodology, I'm just asking you whether, when you sell shares which represent the control of a company, you would sell them -\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I find the question about a sale too close to a legal question. But let me ask it differently. When you value a company, do you take into account the claims as part of the assets that you value when you set a value on the company?\n\nA. Certainly when you're valuing a company, you look at these things. But as far as the assets, you have to understand what's going to the new company and what's not going. I mean, there are potentials for carve-outs, that kind of thing. It's seldom a simple issue.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Obviously. Assume no carve-out, nothing special, just you value a company. Do you take the claims into account?\n\nA. I would take the claims into account inasmuch as I understood who was going to end up with those claims, yes.824\n\nTr. Day 4, 182:18-183:21 (emphasis added).\n\n533.\n\nThis being so, the Parties disagree whether the Claimant retained the right to bring arbitration proceedings against Algeria arising from the events for which OTH had given notice of a dispute in the so-called \"Algerian Risk Sharing Agreement\" entered into between the Claimant and VimpelCom on 15 April 2011.825\n\nAlgerian Risk Sharing Agreement by and between VimpelCom and Weather II, 15 April 2011, Exh. C-230.\n\n534.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to find anything in the Algerian Risk Sharing Agreement that would support the view that the Claimant reserved its claim in relation to *past* measures, i.e. the measures that had occurred until April 2011 and which, as already noted several times, were the subject of all three notifications of dispute. By contrast, a plain reading of the agreement shows that the latter allocates risk concerning possible *future* events.\n\n535.\n\nIn particular, the Risk Sharing Agreement purports to address the scenario in which Algeria were to acquire shares of OTA. The recitals make this clear by expressing the object and purpose of the agreement in the following terms:\n\n\"B. The Algerian Government has initiated several actions against OTA and threatened to acquire shares of OTA \"\n\n\"C. The Parties wish to hereby confirm certain agreements relating to allocation of risks that *may* result from the actions referred to in B\".826\n\nAlgerian Risk Sharing Agreement by and between VimpelCom and Weather II, 15 April 2011, Exh. C-230, Recitals (emphasis added).\n\n536.\n\nOther clauses in the agreement confirm that the agreement only relates to uncertain measures lying in the future, and not to past measures.827 Pursuant to the Risk Sharing Agreement, in the event that Algeria had decided to acquire OTA *after* the sale of the investment by the Claimant to VimpelCom, a mechanism was provided whereby either party owed the other a certain amount of compensation depending on whether the price paid by Algeria was higher or lower than certain price ranges. Importantly, this mechanism of compensation could only be triggered by VimpelCom828 and was provided for a limited period of 6 months.829 It is undisputed between the Parties that this mechanism was never activated and thus lapsed.830\n\nSee e.g., Algerian Risk Sharing Agreement by and between VimpelCom and Weather II, 15 April 2011, Exh. C-230, Section 1 (defining \"Loss of Control Triggering Event\" as follows: \"the loss by OTH of title or control in respect of a controlling stake in the share capital of OTA or the loss of all or substantially all of OTA's assets as a result of any action by the Algerian Government. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of the definition of Loss of Control Triggering Event, the termination or revocation of OTA's GSM licence, or the related frequency permissions, as a result of any action by the Algerian Government, shall constitute the loss of substantially all of OTA's assets, provided that such termination or revocation has become final and non-appealable In Algeria \", emphasis added).\n\nSee Algerian Risk Sharing Agreement by and between VimpelCom and Weather II, 15 April 2011, Exh. C-230, Section 2 (\"VimpelCom shall have the option at any time and at its sole discretion, from the Closing Date to the six month anniversary of the Closing Date, to implement the Algerian Risk Sharing Mechanism with Weather II by sending a written notification to that effect to Weather II. If VimpelCom has not sent such written notification to Weather II within such period, the Algerian Risk Sharing Mechanism shall not apply.\").\n\nSee Algerian Risk Sharing Agreement by and between VimpelCom and Weather II, 15 April 2011, Exh. C-230, Section 2.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 168 (\"VimpelCom decided not to implement the Risk Sharing Agreement and the agreement accordingly lapsed by its own terms\"); R-PHB1, fn. 458.\n\n537.\n\nThus, the Risk Sharing Agreement is not concerned with selling or retaining the right to sue for existing losses in relation to past measures. Therefore, the Tribunal's conclusions that the claim exercised by OTH was transferred to the buyer with the transfer of the shares is unaffected by the content of the Risk Sharing Agreement.\n\n538.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant's sale of its investment does not affect the Tribunal's conclusion on the inadmissibility of the Claimant's claims reached above.\n\nd. **Whether the initiation of these proceedings also constitutes an abuse of rights**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n539.\n\nIn addition to the reasons discussed above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant's pursuit of its claims in these proceedings constitutes an abuse of rights under the circumstances.\n\n540.\n\nIt is undeniable that \"the doctrine of abuse has a role to play in the context of certain forms of conduct in investment arbitration\", as Prof. Dolzer, the Claimant's international law expert, recognized at the Hearing.831 The doctrine of abuse of rights prohibits the exercise of a right for purposes other than those for which the right was established. So far, the doctrine has found application in investment jurisprudence mainly in situations where an investment was restructured to attract BIT protection at a time when a dispute with the host state had arisen or was foreseeable.832 No such situation is present here, as the restructuring of the Weather Group resulting in the Claimant's acquisition of the investment occurred in 2005, long before any dispute with Algeria was foreseeable.\n\nTr. Day 4 (Dolzer), 91:14-15.\n\nSee, among many, *Mobil v. Venezuela,* paras. 169 ff.; *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A. v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/17, Award, 9 January 2015, Exh.

CLA-277.\n\n541.\n\nHowever, as a \"general principle applicable in international law as well as in municipal law\",833 the prohibition of abuse of rights may equally apply in contexts other than the one just mentioned. Indeed, in the words of Sir Hersch Lauterpacht, \"there is no legal right, however well established, which could not, in some circumstances, be refused recognition on the ground that it has been abused\".834\n\nRobert Kolb, \"Part Three Statute of the International Court of Justice, Ch.II Competence of the Court, General Principles of Procedural Law\" in A Zimmermann, K Oellers-Frahm, C Tomuschat, CTams, M Kashgar, D Diehl (eds), The Statute of the International Court of Justice: A Commentary (Oxford University Press, 2nd ed. 2012), p. 904.\n\nHersch Lauterpacht, The Development of International Law by the International Court (1958), p. 164, also cited in Mobil, Jurisdiction, para. 172.\n\n542.\n\nIn particular, an investor who controls several entities in a vertical chain of companies may commit an abuse if it seeks to impugn the same host state measures and claims for the same harm at various levels of the chain in reliance on several investment treaties concluded by the host state.835 It goes without saying that structuring an investment through several layers of corporate entities in different states is not illegitimate. Indeed, the structure may well pursue legitimate corporate, tax, or pre-dispute BIT nationality planning purposes. In the field of investment treaties, the existence of a vertical corporate chain and of treaty protection covering \"indirect\" investments implies that several entities in the chain may claim treaty protection, especially where a host state has entered into several investment treaties. In other words, several corporate entities in the chain may be in a position to bring an arbitration against the host state in relation to the same investment. This possibility, however, does not mean that the host state has accepted to be sued multiple times by various entities under the same control that are part of the vertical chain in relation to the same investment, the same measures and the same harm.\n\nOne could also refer to *Rachel S. Grynberg, Stephen M. Grynberg, Miriam Z. Grynberg and RSM Production Company v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, Exh. RL-75, which although in a different context (treaty claims v. contract claims) and based on a different legal theory (collateral estoppel or issue preclusion known to common law jurisdictions), essentially relies on the same rationale of avoiding that claims involving the same economic damage be adjudged twice.\n\n543.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, this conclusion derives from the purpose of investment treaties, which is to promote the economic development of the host state and to protect the investments made by foreigners that are expected to contribute to such development. If the protection is sought at one level of the vertical chain, and in particular at the first level of foreign shareholding, that purpose is fulfilled.836 The purpose is not served by allowing other entities in the vertical chain controlled by the same shareholder to seek protection for the same harm inflicted on the investment. Quite to the contrary, such additional protection would give rise to a risk of multiple recoveries and conflicting decisions, not to speak of the waste of resources that multiple proceedings involve. The occurrence of such risks would conflict with the promotion of economic development in circumstances where the protection of the investment is already triggered. Thus, where multiple treaties offer entities in a vertical chain similar procedural rights of access to an arbitral forum and comparable substantive guarantees, the initiation of multiple proceedings to recover for essentially the same economic harm would entail the exercise of rights for purposes that are alien to those for which these rights were established.\n\nThis conclusion is without prejudice to the treaty protection that may be available to non-controlling, minority shareholders.\n\n544.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Tribunal reverts to the facts of this case. At the Hearing, Mr. Sawiris himself recognized that he used the protection granted by Algeria in the different treaties at the various layers of the chain, for strategic reasons depending on the circumstances:\n\n[MR. SAWIRIS:] So when I was defending the interests of Orascom Telecom [Holding] [OTH] only, we would use the Egyptian treaty, because that's the instance now that is corresponding, and it's the direct. [...] Then when things start to go worse, you say, \"Listen, guys, it's not go to end up there. There is an Italian treaty, so the mother company can go\". Then when I sell under the gun - and again I come to the different nature of my claim **[\u2026]** I used the Luxembourg treaty.837\n\nTr. Day 2, 189:21-190:13.\n\n545.\n\nIndeed, as explained by Mr. Sawiris, the Claimant first caused one of its subsidiaries, OTH, to bring claims against Algeria. Then, it caused a different subsidiary in the chain, Weather Investments, to threaten to bring a different arbitration in relation to the same dispute. Finally -after selling the investment - it pursued yet another investment treaty proceeding in its own name for the same investment (its past shareholding in OTA) in relation to the same host state measures and the same harm. Doing so, the Claimant availed itself of the existence of various treaties at different levels of the vertical corporate chain using its rights to treaty arbitration and substantive protection in a manner that conflicts with the purposes of such rights and of investment treaties. For the Tribunal, this conduct must be viewed as an abuse of the system of investment protection, which constitutes a further ground for the inadmissibility of the Claimant's claims and precludes the Tribunal from exercising its jurisdiction over this dispute.\n\n**e. Conclusive remarks**\n-------------------------\n\n546.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to stress that the analysis carried out above concerns the *admissibility* of the claims for which relief is sought in this arbitration, as opposed to the merits of the claims in terms of liability or quantum. Furthermore, the Tribunal's conclusions on the inadmissibility of the claims are the result of the peculiar facts of the case, in which (i) the group of companies of which the Claimant was part was organized as a vertical chain; (ii) the entities in the chain were under the control of the same shareholder; (iii) the measures complained of by the various entities in the chain were the same and thus the dispute notified to Algeria by those entities was in essence identical; and (iv) the damage claimed by the various entities was, in its economic essence, the same.\n\n547.\n\nIt is true that tribunals in the past have adopted different approaches in relation to constellations that may show some similarities with the present case. In particular, the tribunals in *CME v. Czech Republic* and *Lauder v. Czech Republic* allowed the claims under different investment treaties to proceed, despite the fact that both sets of proceedings were based on the same facts and sought reparation for the same harm. The tribunals then reached contradicting outcomes, which was one of the reasons for which these decisions attracted wide criticism. This said, these cases should be placed in the context of their procedural history, in which the respondent had refused several offers to consolidate or otherwise coordinate proceedings.838 Moreover, it cannot be denied that in the fifteen years that have followed those cases, the investment treaty jurisprudence has evolved, including on the application of the principle of abuse of rights (or abuse of process), as was recalled above. The resort to such principle has allowed tribunals to apply investment treaties in such a manner as to avoid consequences unforeseen by their drafters and at odds with the very purposes underlying the conclusion of those treaties.\n\nSee *Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award, 3 September 2001, Exh. CLA-71; paras. 173, 178; *CME Czech Republic B.V. (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 September 2001, Exh. CLA-22; para. 412.\n\n548.\n\nIn conclusion, for the reasons set out above, the Claimant\u2019s claims are inadmissible and the Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute. Given this holding, the Tribunal can dispense with examining the other objections presented by Algeria and summarized in section V.D.1-3 above, as a determination on those objections would not change the outcome of the case.\n\n**E. WHETHER THE ACTS OF ENTV ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO ALGERIA**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the acts of the state-owned television provider ENTV (also referred to as EPTV by the Respondent) are not attributable to Algeria.839 ENTV is not an organ of the state pursuant to Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,840 nor can it be considered an entity exercising elements of governmental authority under Article 5 of the ILC Articles.841 It cannot be deemed either to have acted on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of the Algerian state pursuant to Article 8 of the ILC Articles.842\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 256-258; Reply, paras. 366-377.\n\nReply, paras. 366-368.\n\nReply, paras. 369-374.\n\nReply, paras. 375-376.\n\n550.\n\nFor the Respondent, questions of attribution concern jurisdiction and not the merits.843 The Respondent invokes *Hamester v. Ghana*, where the tribunal noted that \"the question of attribution looks more like a jurisdictional question\".844 The Respondent notes that the *Hamester* tribunal decided to deal with attribution at the merits stage solely for practical reasons.845\n\nReply, paras. 362-365.\n\nReply, para. 362, discussing *Gustav F.W.

Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, Exh. CLA-170, para. 144.\n\n551.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that arbitral tribunals have confirmed that the issue of attribution must be examined at the jurisdictional stage where it may be resolved \"based upon a limited enquiry\" or has been sufficiently discussed by the parties.846\n\nReply, para. 363, discussing *Salini Costruttori S.p.A. & Italstrade S.p.A. v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012, Exh. CLA-210.\n\n552.\n\nIn this case, the attribution of the acts of ENTV to Algeria does not require the review of a large number of documents and can thus be easily dealt with.847 For these reasons, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal decline jurisdiction over the claims involving acts of ENTV.848\n\nReply, para. 364; R-PHB 1, para. 167.\n\nReply, para. 377.\n\n**2. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n553.\n\nThe Claimant's position is that the objection concerning the attribution of ENTV's actions pertains to the merits of the dispute and not to jurisdiction or admissibility, unless it is \"manifest that the entity involved had no link whatsoever with the State\".849\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 147; and Rejoinder, paras. 300-301, discussing *Noble Energy, Inc. and Machalapower CIA.

Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, Exh. CLA-170, para. 144 (\"In any event, whatever the qualification of the question of attribution, the Tribunal notes that, as a practical matter, this question is usually best dealt with at the merits stage, in order to allow for an in-depth analysis of all the parameters of the complex relationship between certain acts and the State\"); *Tulip Real Estate Investment and Development Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Award, 10 March 2014, Exh. CLA-215, paras. 276-278 (concurring with the observations of the tribunal in *Hamester v. Ghana*).\n\n554.\n\nIn this case, the Claimant submits, the evidence shows that ENTV is a state-owned entity with close financial and operational ties with the state. It is, therefore, appropriate to deal with the attribution of ENTV's acts with the merits of the dispute in order to allow an in-depth analysis of all of the parameters of its relationship with the state.850 This is the more so as the assessment of the Respondent's responsibility for ENTV's conduct as a matter of international law will require a careful examination of many documents in their proper context.851\n\nRejoinder, para. 301.\n\nRejoinder, para. 305.\n\n555.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Claimant concludes that the Tribunal cannot decide this issue on the basis of the Parties' submissions on preliminary objections without the benefit of further pleadings and evidence. The Tribunal should thus postpone this issue until the merits phase.852\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 147; Rejoinder, para. 306; C-PHB 2, para. 113.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n556.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion reached in section V.D.4 above according to which the Claimant's claims are inadmissible, the Tribunal can dispense with resolving this additional objection, as a determination on this point would not change the outcome of the case.\n\n**F. WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CONTRACT CLAIMS BASED ON THEINVESTMENT AGREEMENT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s \"purely contractual claims\" relating to the Investment Agreement.853\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 259-269; Reply, paras. 378-391.\n\n558.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Respondent submits that it is generally accepted that a BIT tribunal has no jurisdiction over a pure contract claim.854 This applies to the claims based on the tax reassessments initiated against OTA and the suspension of OTA\u2019s bank domiciliation by the Bank of Algeria, which are manifestly grounded on the obligations contained in the Investment Agreement.855\n\nReply, para. 380.\n\nReply, para. 378; R-PHB 1, para. 169.\n\n559.\n\nSpecifically, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over these claims for three main reasons. First, the parties to the Investment Agreement, i.e. OTA and the Respondent, have finally settled the contract claims arising out of the Investment Agreement.856 Second, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend to breaches of a contract to which the Claimant is not a party.857 Third, as the Respondent further explains in its separate admissibility objection, the claims cannot fall within the umbrella clause invoked by the Claimant, be it the one contained in the Treaty or an umbrella clause of a different investment treaty made applicable by operation of the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause. Indeed, an umbrella clause only covers contract obligations entered into with the foreign investor itself, and not with a subsidiary.\n\nReply, paras. 382-284.\n\nReply, paras. 385-387, discussing *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 December 2003, Exh. CLA-144.\n\n**2. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nThe Claimant submits that each of its claims in connection with the Investment Agreement is for a violation of a provision of the BIT.\n\n561.\n\nThe Claimant does not dispute that a treaty tribunal has no jurisdiction over contract breaches that do not at the same time constitute breaches of the substantive standards of the BIT.858 However, the claims in relation to the Investment Agreement are for violations of the Respondent\u2019s umbrella clause obligations under Article 2(3) of the Algeria-Denmark bilateral investment treaty via the MFN clause in Article 10 of the BIT, as well as for violations of the Claimant's legitimate expectations with respect to the Investment Agreement as protected by the fair and equitable treatment standard in the BIT.859\n\nRejoinder, para. 308.\n\nRejoinder, para. 308; C-PHB 2, para. 114.\n\n562.\n\nThe Claimant observes that investment tribunals have repeatedly held that an umbrella clause elevates contract claims to treaty claims.860 The umbrella clause in Article 2(3) of the Algeria-Denmark bilateral investment treaty covers \"any obligation [the state] may have entered into with regard to investments of investors\". The Respondent's obligations under the Investment Agreement thus falls within the scope of the umbrella clause with the result that any breach of the Investment Agreement constitutes a breach of the BIT.861\n\nRejoinder, paras. 309-311.\n\nRejoinder, para. 311.\n\n563.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that it is also well established that contractual commitments undertaken by the state may give rise to legitimate expectations protected under international law.862 As the Respondent's measures in violation of the Investment Agreement frustrated the Claimant's legitimate expectations, they amount to a breach of the FET standard guaranteed in Article 3(1) of the BIT.863\n\nRejoinder, para. 312.\n\nRejoinder, para. 312.\n\n564.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent's argument that tribunals generally refuse to exercise jurisdiction over breaches of contract to which an entity other than the claimant is a named party is incorrect. The Claimant cites to *Continental Casualty v. Argentina* and *EDF v. Argentina* for the proposition that an umbrella clause may extend to contract obligations entered with persons or entities other than the foreign investor itself.864\n\nRejoinder, paras. 314-315, discussing *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, Exh. CLA-28, and *EDF Int'l S.A., SAUR Int'l S.A., and Leon Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award, 11 June 2012, Exh. CLA-36. See also C-PHB 2, para. 116.\n\n565.\n\nFinally, the Respondent's position according to which the claims arising from the Investment Agreement have been settled by the parties to that agreement, i.e., OTA and Algeria, is unavailing, as the Claimant is not privy to that settlement. In addition, the Claimant seeks compensation for harm that was not suffered by OTA or OTH and could therefore not have been remedied by any settlement concluded between OTA or OTH and the Respondent.865\n\nRejoinder, para. 316.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n566.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's conclusion reached in section V.D.4 above pursuant to which the claims before it are inadmissible, the Tribunal may dispense with resolving this additional objection, as a determination on this point would not change the outcome of the case.\n\n**G. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT'S UMBRELLA CLAUSE CLAIMS ARE ADMISSIBLE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the umbrella clause claims in relation to the Investment Agreement, the GSM License, and the Investment Code are inadmissible.\n\n568.\n\nThe Respondent first submits that the umbrella clause contained in Article 8(2) of the BIT only applies to commitments made by one of the Contracting Parties to the investors of the other Contracting Parties.866 In other words, the umbrella clause in Article 8(2) protects specific as opposed to general commitments.867 It is also limited to commitments made to the investor itself, rather than to its subsidiary or its investment.868\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 295-307; Reply, paras. 436-439.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 298-301.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 302-304.\n\n569.\n\nAlgeria bases its argumentation on the wording of Article 8 of the BIT, entitled \"specific agreements\", which reads as follows:\n\n1. Investments made pursuant to a specific agreement concluded between one Contracting Party and investors of the other Party shall be governed by the provisions both of this Agreement and of the specific agreement.\n\n2. Each Contracting Party shall at all times ensure respect for the commitments which it has made to investors of the other Contracting Party.869\n\nBIT, Exh. C-658, Art. 8.\n\n570.\n\nThe Respondent invokes investment awards, among which *Burlington,* for the proposition that the scope of an umbrella clause thus phrased does not extend to non-signatories to the specific agreement.870\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 305-306; R-PHB 1, para. 175.\n\n571.\n\nIn this case, neither the Investment Code (which is an instrument of general nature, and does not entail a specific commitment)871 nor the Investment Agreement and the GSM License (which were signed with and granted to OTA) fall within the scope of the umbrella clause in Article 8(2) of the BIT.872\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 315-319.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 320-321.\n\n572.\n\nMoreover, it is the Respondent\u2019s submission that the Claimant is not entitled to rely upon the MFN clause in Article 10 of the BIT to invoke the allegedly more favorable umbrella clause in the Algeria-Denmark bilateral investment treaty.873 It considers that the scope of the MFN clause in Article 10 of the BIT is limited to \"treatment of investments [...] in the territory of the other Party\" and contends that \"this restrictive language\" distinguishes Article 10 from the MFN clauses at issue in those cases in which tribunals have allowed the use of an MFN clause to import a substantive obligation in a different treaty.874\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 308-314; Reply, paras. 440-450.\n\nReply, para. 448 *(\"\"relatives au traitement des investissements sur le territoire de l\u2019autre Partie\"; \"Cette r\u00e9daction restrictive permet de distinguer l'article 10 des autres clauses* \").\n\n**2. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n573.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it is entitled to rely upon the MFN clause in Article 10 of the BIT to invoke more favorable standards of protection in other investment treaties concluded by Algeria, including in particular the umbrella clause in Article 2(3) of the Algeria-Denmark bilateral investment treaty.875\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 142-143; Rejoinder, para. 317; C-PHB 2, paras. 119-120. Article 2(3) of the Denmark-Algeria BIT reads as follows:  \n Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.  \n See Agreement Between the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark and The Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria Concerning the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, signed 25 January 1999 (entered into force 15 July 2005), Exh. C-863, Art. 2(3).\n\n574.\n\nFor the Claimant, the question whether the MFN clause in Article 10 of the BIT applies to umbrella clause obligations is one of treaty interpretation and depends upon the specific terms of the relevant treaty.876 The Claimant underscores that the Respondent omits crucial language in Article 10 of the BIT, which provides as follows:\n\nln all matters relating to the treatment of investments, investors of each Contracting Party shall enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment in the territory of the other Party.877\n\nRejoinder, para. 319.\n\nBIT, Exh. C-658, Art. 10.\n\n575.\n\nNumerous tribunals have held, so says the Claimant, that the ordinary meaning of the terms \"all matters\" points to a broad interpretation. The reference to \"all matters concerning the treatment of investments\" confirms that the scope of application of Article 10 extends to all substantive standards in the BIT, including the umbrella clause in Article 8(2).878\n\nRejoinder, paras. 320-323.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n576.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's conclusion reached in section V.D.4 above according to which the claims in this arbitration are inadmissible, the Tribunal may dispense with resolving this additional objection, as a determination on this point would not change the outcome of the case.\n\nVI. **COSTS**\n-------------\n\n577.\n\nBoth Parties request an award of costs in respect of the legal fees and expenses and the costs incurred in connection with this proceeding and have filed submissions quantifying their fees and costs.879\n\nSee Claimant's Submission on Costs, 4 December 2015 (\"Claimant's Submission on Costs\"); Claimant's Reply Submission on Costs, 18 December 2015 (\"Claimant's Reply Submission on Costs\"); Respondent's Submission on Costs, 4 December 2015 (\"Respondent's Submission on Costs\"); Respondent's Reply Submission on Costs, 18 December 2015 (\"Respondent's Reply Submission on Costs\").\n\n578.\n\nThe Claimant's legal fees and expenses, including expert fees and costs, amount to US$ 20,673,811.30, out of which US$ 10,144,900.68 were incurred in respect of the phase of the proceedings dealing with the Respondent's jurisdiction and admissibility objections (the \"preliminary phase\").880 In addition, the Claimant has advanced US$ 674,975.00 on account of the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees and expenses. The Claimant requests that the Tribunal order the Respondent to bear all of the Claimant's costs incurred during the preliminary phase of this proceeding.881\n\nSee Claimant's Updated Costs, 3 March 2017, p. 1.\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, para. 23.\n\n579.\n\nThe Respondent has incurred legal fees and expenses in the amount of US$ 5,685,622.02 and expert fees and costs in the amount of \u20ac116,764.32.882 In addition, it has advanced US$ 674,975.00 on account of the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the ICSID administrative fees and expenses. The Respondent seeks an award of the entirety of these costs.883\n\nRespondent's Updated Costs, 3 March 2017, para. 2.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 29.\n\n580.\n\nThe Claimant argues that a costs award is warranted because a prevailing party is entitled to such an award under the principle of costs follow the event and because the Respondent has conducted the arbitration in a manner which has led to delay and increased costs. In particular, the Claimant contends that the Tribunal should take into account the following factors in allocating costs in favor of the Claimant: (i) The Respondent repeatedly expanded the scope of the preliminary phase of these proceedings by raising new objections, even as late as in its Post-Hearing Brief;884 (ii) the Respondent made numerous far-reaching document requests, which greatly increased the Claimant's costs;885 and (iii) the Respondent failed to comply with the Tribunal's orders granting the Claimant's document requests.886 The Claimant submits that in light of the history and the nature of the preliminary phase of this proceeding, its costs are reasonable and \"not significantly higher than the costs Respondent incurred during the same period\".887\n\nClaimant's Submission on Costs, paras. 9-12.

This provision establishes the Tribunal\u2019s discretion in allocating ICSID arbitration costs and the Parties' costs, including legal fees.\n\n583.\n\nTwo approaches have been adopted by ICSID tribunals in awarding costs. The first consists in apportioning ICSID costs in equal shares and ruling that each party shall bear its own costs. The second applies the principle \"costs follow the event\", such that the losing party bears the costs of the proceedings, including those of the other party, or that the parties share in the costs proportionately to their success or failure.\n\n584.\n\nIn reaching its decision on costs in this case, the Tribunal has in particular considered the following circumstances. First, the outcome of the case is ultimately favorable to the Respondent, as the Tribunal has decided that all of the Claimant\u2019s claims are inadmissible. Second, the Tribunal has also found that the Claimant\u2019s pursuit of the claims in this arbitration amounts to an abuse of rights. These two reasons justify that at least a significant proportion of the overall costs be borne by the Claimant. At the same time, the Claimant has prevailed on the Respondent\u2019s objections on *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae* jurisdiction. Considering the length of the submissions and the time devoted at the Hearing to those two objections, the costs incurred in relation to these two objections were certainly significant. While these objections were not frivolous and the Respondent was entitled to raise them, they were ultimately rejected, and it is thus fair that the outcome of such objections be taken into consideration in the Tribunal\u2019s decision on cost allocation.\n\n585.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, in the exercise of its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to apportion the costs in the following manner. First, the Claimant shall pay the entirety of the costs of the proceedings, i.e., the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and the ICSID costs. The Claimant shall thus reimburse the advances that the Respondent has made to ICSID. In this latter respect, it is noted that the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a statement of the case account in due course. Second, the Claimant shall pay 50% of the fees and expenses which the Respondent has incurred in connection with this arbitration, i.e. US$ 2,842,811.01 plus \u20ac58,382.16. In this respect, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent's costs appear reasonable considering the complexity of the case.\n\n**VII. LANGUAGES OF THIS AWARD**\n--------------------------------\n\n586.\n\nIn accordance with Section 8 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal renders this Award in both English and French. This being so, it notes that English is the language in which this Award was originally drafted. Hence, in the event of any discrepancy between the two versions, the English version must be deemed to reflect the meaning intended by the Tribunal.\n\n**VIII DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n587.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. The claims raised in this arbitration are inadmissible and the Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute;\n\nb. The Claimant shall reimburse to the Respondent the amounts which the Respondent has deposited with ICSID for the costs of the arbitration;\n\nc. The Claimant shall pay US$ 2,842,811.01 plus \u20ac58,382.16 to the Respondent, as a contribution to the legal fees and other expenses which the Respondent incurred in connection with the arbitration;\n\nd.

A statement of OTMTI's Chief Financial Officer, describing OTMTI's efforts to obtain the guarantee, was attached to the letter. The Applicant informed the Committee about its efforts to identify alternative solutions. The Applicant proposed two alternatives in order to comply with the Committee's decision:\n\n(i) an undertaking in the form of a corporate guarantee from OTMTI that it would pay the amounts due under the Award, if the Award is upheld, or\n\n(ii) an escrow arrangement with the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\"), which would hold the amounts due under the Award in escrow pending the outcome of the annulment proceeding.\n\nIn the event the second option was selected, the Applicant requested an extension of 30 days to finalize an escrow agreement and deposit the funds with the PCA.\n\n45.\n\nOn May 5, 2018, the Committee invited the Respondent to submit its comments on the Applicant's letter by May 8, 2018.\n\n46.\n\nOn May 8, 2018, the Respondent submitted its observations on the Applicant's letter of May 4, 2018.\n\n47.\n\nOn May 9, 2018, the Committee issued a Decision Modifying the Conditions for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, whereby it decided to modify the operative clause (paragraph 73) of its Decision of March 12, 2018 as follows:\n\n(1) The stay of enforcement of the Award shall continue until the Decision of the Committee on the Application for Partial Annulment subject to the conditions specified in paragraph 14[4] above of the present Decision;\n\n(2) If the conditions set out above are not complied with, the stay of enforcement shall be automatically terminated; and\n\n(3) The costs of this phase of the proceeding are reserved.5\n\nParagraph 14 reads as follows: \"Accordingly, the Committee decides that the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award rendered on May 31, 2017, in *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0.r.l.* v. *People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35) shall continue until the date on which the Committee issues its Decision on the Annulment Application submitted by the Applicant provided, however, that the Applicant deposits, by June 15, 2018, at the latest, the amount of US$ 3,508,598.13 and \u20ac 58,382.16 due under the Award to an escrow a ccount administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague and the above-mentioned amounts may only be drawn upon by Algeria by presentation of a Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee rejecting the Annulment Application\".\n\nDecision Modifying the Conditions for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, para. 15.\n\n48.\n\nOn June 13, 2018, the Applicant informed the Committee, that in accordance with the Committee's Decision Modifying the Conditions for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, the Applicant had reached an agreement with the PCA on the terms of a draft escrow agreement and requested that the Committee extend the deadline for it to deposit the funds into the escrow until June 29, 2018, to which the Respondent did not object.\n\n49.\n\nOn June 15, 2018, the Committee agreed to insert into Article 5, paragraph 1 (ii), an additional condition for the release of the funds from the escrow account, namely the Committee's written instruction to the PCA. The Committee further indicated that it did not consider necessary for the Respondent to be a party to the escrow agreement, but it should rather be a beneficiary if the conditions therein are met. Finally, it extended the time limit for establishing the escrow agreement and depositing the amounts due under the Award until June 29, 2018.\n\n50.\n\nOn June 15, 2018, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment, together with Annex I, Legal Authorities RL-282 through RL-342 (the \"**Counter-Memorial**\").\n\n51.\n\nOn June 28, 2018, the PCA acknowledged receipt of funds in the amount of US$ 3,508,598.13 and \u20ac 58,382.16 deposited by the Applicant pursuant to the Escrow Agreement concluded on June 27, 2018.\n\n52.\n\nOn July 30, 2018, following further exchanges with the Parties, the Committee confirmed that the hearing on annulment would take place on May 27-28, 2019 in Paris.\n\n53.\n\nOn August 14, 2018, the Applicant informed the Committee that the Parties had agreed to revise the procedural calendar for their remaining written submissions, which the Committee agreed to on August 20, 2018.\n\n54.\n\nOn October 12, 2018, the Applicant filed its Reply on Partial Annulment of the Award together with the Supplemental Expert Opinion of Professor Jan Paulsson, the fourth Expert Opinion of Professor Rudolf Dolzer and Legal Authorities CLA-454 through CLA-493 (the \"**Reply**\").\n\n55.\n\nOn February 15, 2019, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Annulment along with Legal Authorities RL-343 through RL-376 (the \"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n56.\n\nOn March 21, 2019, the Secretary of the Committee invited the Parties to (i) confer and revert to the Committee regarding the organization of the hearing, and (ii) indicate whether they considered that a pre-hearing call with the President would be needed.\n\n57.\n\nOn April 19, 2019, the Respondent informed the Committee that a pre-hearing conference call was necessary to resolve the Parties' disagreements. On April 20, 2019, the Applicant confirmed its agreement.\n\n58.\n\nOn April 22, 2019, the Committee circulated the draft agenda for the pre-hearing organizational meeting and invited the Parties to provide their comments by April 29, 2019.\n\n59.\n\nOn May 2, 2019, the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n60.\n\nOn May 2, 2019, the Committee asked the Parties whether they would agree to the attendance of Mr. Weiler, an associate currently working at CMS Hasche Sigle in Munich with Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs, at the hearing on annulment. The Parties respectively agreed to his attendance on May 2 and 3, 2019, and the Secretariat transmitted Mr. Weiler's confidentiality declaration to the Parties on May 6, 2019.\n\n61.\n\nOn May 4, 2019, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the organization of the hearing on annulment.\n\n62.\n\nOn May 14, 2019, the Respondent requested a leave to submit into the record as a legal authority a decision on the application for annulment rendered on March 18, 2019 by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd.* v. *Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case Nos. ARB/12/14 and ARB/12/40) *.*\n\n63.\n\nIn its letter of May 20, 2019, the Applicant did not object, in principle, to the introduction of that annulment decision into the record. However, it also requested a leave to submit into the record an article written by Mr. A.

THE AWARD**\n------------------\n\n**1. GENERAL PRESENTATION OF THE AWARD**\n----------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe 158-page Award (in English; 172-page in French) was rendered on May 31, 2017 by the Tribunal consisting of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler (presiding), Professor Albert Jan van den Berg and Professor Brigitte Stern. The Tribunal rejected the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction but decided that \"the claims raised in this arbitration [were] inadmissible and the Tribunal [was] precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute\".6\n\nAward, para. 587.\n\n74.\n\nThe Award is divided into eight chapters. Chapter I introduces the Parties and provides a brief overview of the dispute which arose from \"the Claimant's alleged investment to build a mobile telephone system in Algeria\".7\n\nAward, para. 5.\n\n75.\n\nChapter II records the procedural history of the arbitration proceedings. Chapter III, entitled \"Preliminary Matters\", makes it clear that the Award addresses only preliminary objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the admissibility of the Claimant's claims. It further specifies the law applicable to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. According to the Tribunal, its jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention and the BIT.8 No law is, however, identified in this chapter as governing the issue of admissibility of the Claimant's claims.\n\nAward, para. 134.\n\n76.\n\nChapter IV describes facts which the Tribunal considered relevant to jurisdiction and admissibility, namely the structure of the Weather Group, the origin of the Claimant's alleged investment in OTA and the acquisition of Wind Telecommunicazioni S.p.A. In the view of the Tribunal, these facts were relevant in particular to the Respondent's objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility \"in relation to the Claimant's status of indirect shareholder, the OTH Arbitration and settlement, and the sale of the Claimant's investment\".9\n\nAward, para. 141.\n\n77.\n\nThe longest chapter of the Award, Chapter V, provides a summary of the Parties' arguments on the Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and to the admissibility of the claims, the Tribunal's detailed analysis of these objections and its conclusions.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent raised an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* arguing that the BIT requires the investor to have its \"real seat\" (\"*si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el*\") in one of the Contracting States. The Respondent contended that the Claimant's real seat is not in Luxembourg, but in Egypt. After a detailed analysis10 of the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and of the BIT, the Tribunal concluded, by majority, that \"'*si\u00e8ge social*' in the definition of the BIT means '*registered office*' or '*si\u00e8ge statutaire*', in the sense of the 'seat' appearing in a corporation's constitutive documents\".11 Since the Claimant was constituted in accordance with Luxembourg law and has its registered office in Luxembourg, the Tribunal reached the conclusion that the Claimant is an investor within the meaning of Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT12 and that it is also a national of a Contracting Party under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.13\n\nAward, paras. 257-324.\n\nAward, para. 314.\n\n*Ibid*. Arbitrator Stern disagreed with the Tribunal's analysis and succinctly expressed her view that \"*si\u00e8ge social*\" as referred to in the BIT can only mean \"*si\u00e8ge r\u00e9el*\". See Award, fn. 356.\n\nAward, para. 315.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal considered next the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction *ratione materiae*. The Respondent argued that the Claimant made no investment within the meaning of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal, after having considered the Parties' arguments, concluded that \"the Claimant made a number of successive investments within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT\"14 and that \"the Claimant's indirect shareholding in OTA constituted an investment pursuant to Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention\".15\n\nAward, para. 380.\n\nAward, para. 385.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal subsequently dealt in the Award with the Respondent's several objections in relation to the Claimant's (former) status as an indirect investor and the parallel arbitral proceedings initiated by OTH. The Tribunal noted that \"[t]he characterization of these objections in terms of jurisdiction or admissibility has somewhat changed in the course of the proceedings\".16 The Tribunal divided the Respondent's assertions that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction or that the claims are inadmissible into three groups:\n\n(a) The Claimant is or was a \"'very indirect' shareholder which is 'too far removed'\" from the investment affected by the Respondent's measures;\n\n(b) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or the claims are inadmissible as a result of the concurrent proceedings launched by OTH which resulted in a settlement between the parties to those proceedings; and\n\n(c) The Claimant sold its investment before filing the Request for Arbitration and has thus lost or waived its right to bring arbitration proceedings against Algeria, which either deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction or entails the inadmissibility of the claims.17\n\nAward, para. 386.\n\nAward, para. 386.\n\n81.\n\nAfter having set out rather in detail the Parties' arguments on all these issues,18 the Tribunal provided its analyses in paragraphs 485-548. It started with establishing the timeline of the main events, which it considered relevant to the objections under consideration.19 It then examined the notices of dispute sent by OTH, Weather Investments, and the Claimant to Algeria. The Tribunal noted that while the companies giving notice and investment treaties invoked were different, the three notices concerned the same measures or events.20 The Tribunal highlighted, in a table, what it considered to be the main passages from the three notices of dispute.21 The Tribunal expressed its view that \"while the parties to the dispute and the legal bases for the claims (the BITs) are different, the dispute being notified in the three notices is effectively one and the same\".22 It further stressed that the three notices were all sent by Mr. Sawiris and that he was the controlling shareholder of these companies.23\n\nAward, paras. 387-484.\n\nAward, para. 485.\n\nAward, paras. 486 and 488.\n\nAward, para. 487 at pp. 121-128.\n\nAward, para. 488. Em pha sis added.\n\nAward, para. 490.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal believed that these companies constituted the vertically integrated chain and \"several entities could in theory, at least, bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent\".24 It expressed, however, the view that \"the existence of several legal foundations for arbitration does not necessarily mean that the various entities in the shareholder chain could make use of the existing arbitration clauses to assail the same measures and to recover the same economic loss under any circumstances\".25 And it continued by noting that, \"[i]ndeed, the purpose of investment treaty arbitration is to grant full reparation for the injuries that a qualifying investor may have suffered as a result of a host State's wrongful measures\".26 In its view, \"[i]f the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration, the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral proceedings may become inadmissible depending on the circumstances\".27\n\nAward, para. 495.\n\nAward, para. 495.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*. Emphasis a dded.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal found that \"[i]n the circumstances of the present dispute [\u2026] the claims [we]re inadmissible on several counts\".28 It assigned \"a decisive importance\" to OTH's Notice of Dispute, noting that \"the Claimant and its controlling shareholder, Mr. Sawiris, caused the corporate organs of OTH to crystallize the dispute at the level of OTA's direct investor\".29\n\nAward, para. 496.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal observed that on November 2, 2010 (the date of the OTH Notice of Dispute), \"the legal protection that was available at the various levels of the corporate chain was activated at the OTH level\".30 In the view of the Tribunal, \"[b]y exercising its right to arbitrate against Algeria, OTH placed itself in the position of being made whole for the alleged harm\".31 The Tribunal continued by stating that \"[t]o the extent OTH would have restored its company value through arbitration proceedings under the BIT, all of the companies higher up in the corporate chain, including the Claimant, would have been made whole as well\".32 In its view, \"[i]f the value of OTH is restored, then the shareholders of OTH suffer no loss, unless they incurred a loss of their own which is independent of the value of OTH\".33\n\nAward, para. 497.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nAward, para. 498.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal subsequently proceeded to the review of the losses that the Claimant alleged to have suffered as a result of Algeria's measures, with a view to examining whether the Claimant requested a relief for losses that only itself suffered irrespective of the valuation of OTH.34 It found that \"the claims before the Tribunal in reality seek reparation for losses covered by the requests for relief raised in the OTH Arbitration or for losses that the Claimant [\u2026] must or should have factored into the sale of its investment to VimpelCom\".35 In light of the above, it concluded \"that the claims are inadmissible\".36\n\nAward, paras. 499-517.\n\nAward, para. 518.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal then considered the relevance of the settlement agreement between National Investment Fund of Algeria, OTH and VimpelCom. It opined that \"the Claimant cannot bring claims in this arbitration that OTH decided to settle, as the settlement clearly resolved the dispute that the Claimant has brought before this Tribunal\".37 According to the Tribunal, \"[i]n the absence of harm which it incurred itself to the exclusion of OTH, the Claimant cannot take over the dispute that OTH has settled\".38 The Tribunal was convinced that \"the settlement agreement [\u2026] confirms that the Claimant's claims are inadmissible\".39\n\nAward, para. 524.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nAward, para. 526.\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal also considered the relevance of the sale of the Claimant's investment to VimpelCom three years before the settlement.40 It did not accept the Claimant's arguments on this point. In the Tribunal's view, the fact that the Claimant sold its investment does not change the Tribunal's conclusions that the claims are inadmissible. According to the Tribunal, it even \"reinforces them [i.e., these conclusions]\".41\n\nAward, paras. 527-538.\n\nAward, para. 527.\n\n88.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal found that \"the Claimant's pursuit of its claims constitute[d] [\u2026] an abuse of rights under the circumstances\".42 In the Tribunal's view, this \"constitute[d] a further ground for the inadmissibility of the Claimant's claims and preclude[d] the Tribunal from exercising its jurisdiction over the dispute\".43\n\nAward, para. 539. The reasons are provided in paras. 540-545.\n\nAward, para. 545.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasized that its analysis concerned the admissibility of the claims, not of their merits in terms of liability or quantum. It pointed out that its conclusions on the inadmissibility of the claims \"are the result of the peculiar facts of the case\", in which:\n\n(i) The group of companies of which the Claimant was part was organized as a vertical chain;\n\n(ii) The entities in the chain were under the control of the same shareholder;\n\n(iii) The measures complained of by the various entities in the chain were the same and thus the dispute notified to Algeria by those entities was in essence identical; and\n\n(iv) The damage claimed by the various entities was, in its economic essence, the same.44\n\nAward, para. 546.\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal finally noted that \"in the past [tribunals] have adopted different approaches in relation to constellations that may show some similarities with the present case\".45 It specifically referred to the tribunals in *CME* v. *Czech Republic* and *Lauder* v. *Czech Republic*, noting that the tribunals \"then reached contradicting outcomes\" which, in its view, \"was one of the reasons for which these decisions attracted wide criticism\".46 The Tribunal, however, observed that in the past fifteen years \"the investment treaty jurisprudence ha[d] evolved, including on the principle of abuse of rights (or abuse of process)\".47\n\nAward, para. 547.\n\nAward, para. 547.\n\nAward, para. 547.\n\n91.\n\nIn view of its conclusion that the claims of Orascom TMT Investments are inadmissible, the Tribunal did not consider it necessary to deal with the remaining objections to jurisdiction, namely that the acts of ENTV (*Entreprise Nationale de T\u00e9l\u00e9vision*) are not attributable to Algeria48 and that it does not have jurisdiction over the contract claims based on the Investment Agreement.49 For the same reason, the Tribunal also considered that it was not necessary for it to deal with an additional objection to the admissibility of Claimant's umbrella clause claims.50\n\nAward, para. 556.\n\nAward, para. 566.\n\nAward, para. 576.\n\n92.\n\nThe short Chapter VI of the Award deals with the costs. The Tribunal decided that the Claimant shall bear the entirety of the costs of the proceedings, i.e., the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the ICSID costs. It also decided that the Claimant shall reimburse 50% of the Respondent's fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration.51\n\nAward, para. 585.\n\n93.\n\nAlthough the Award was rendered both in English and French, the Tribunal specified in Chapter VII that in case of any discrepancy between the two versions, the English version must be deemed to reflect the meaning intended by the Tribunal.52 The final chapter, Chapter VIII, contains the Tribunal's decision.\n\nAward, para. 586.\n\n**2. PARTS OF THE AWARD THE ANNULMENT OF WHICH IS REQUESTED**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Applicant seeks the partial annulment of the Award. While it is satisfied and does not take any issue with the treatment of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections and their rejection by the Tribunal,53 the Applicant challenges the part of the Award dealing with the issue of the admissibility of its claims and the conclusion of the Tribunal that the claims are inadmissible. Therefore, it seeks to annul the portions of the Award relating to admissibility and costs,54 specifically paragraphs 485-585 and 587 of the Award.55\n\nThe Tribunal, having considered them, rejected the objections to its jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae*. In light of its conclusion that the Claimant's claims are inadmissible, the Tribunal did not consider it necessary to deal with Respondent's remaining objections to jurisdiction, namely whether the acts of ENTV are attributable to the Respondent and whether it has jurisdiction over the contract claims based on the Investment Agreement.\n\nApplication, para. 7.\n\nA. PHB1, para. 1.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal declared OTMTI's claims inadmissible on two grounds, namely the preclusive effect of the OTH's Notice of Dispute and the abuse of rights. In this section, the Committee will summarize the relevant parts of the Tribunal's reasons for its conclusions that OTMTI seeks to annul.\n\n**A. Preclusive effect of OTH's Notice of Dispute**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Comparison of the different Notices of Dispute*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal began its analysis by comparing the three Notices of Dispute sent by OTH, Weather Investments and OTMTI. After a textual analysis of the different notices, it found that they \"concern the same measures or events\"56 and that both Weather Investments and OTMTI themselves \"considered the dispute to be one and the same\" *.*57\n\nAward, para. 486.\n\nAward, para. 489.\n\n97.\n\nOn the facts, the Tribunal also stressed that:\n\nThere is no controversy that at the time when the OTH and Weather Investments Notices of Dispute were sent, Mr. Sawiris and his family were the ultimate beneficial owners and Mr. Sawiris was the controlling shareholder of these companies. There is equally no dispute that the Weather Group constituted a vertically integrated chain of companies, in which the companies higher up in the chain controlled and directed the companies further down *.*58\n\nAward, para. 490. Footnote omitted.\n\n*(b) Legal rule*\n----------------\n\n98.\n\nThe starting point of the Tribunal's legal analysis was the consideration that in a corporate chain, several entities could in theory initiate arbitration proceeding:\n\nIn the vertically integrated chain that constituted the Weather Group, several entities could in theory at least bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent. OTA could rely on the ICSID clause in the Investment Agreement. OTH as direct foreign shareholders could invoke the arbitration clause in the Algeria-Egypt BIT. Weather Investments as indirect foreign shareholder could claim on the basis of the arbitration provision in the Algeria-Italy BIT. And the Claimant, another indirect foreign investor, could start arbitration based on the Algeria-BLEU BIT *.*59\n\nAward, para. 495. Footnote omitted.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal then described a legal rule that a claim of one entity of a corporate chain may become inadmissible if the harm was fully repaired in another arbitration involving other members of the vertical chain:\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the existence of several legal foundations for arbitration does not necessarily mean that the various entities in the shareholder chain could make use of the existing arbitration clauses to assail the same measures and to recover the same economic loss under any circumstances. Indeed, the purpose of investment treaty arbitration is to grant full reparation for the injuries that a qualifying investor may have suffered as a result of a host state's wrongful measures. If the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration, the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral proceedings may become inadmissible depending on the circumstances*.*60\n\nAward, para. 495. Emphasis added.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal then went on to find OTMTI's claims inadmissible as the dispute had been activated by OTMTI at the level of OTH:\n\nOTH's Notice of Dispute assumes a decisive importance, in itself and in combination with the subsequent events. On 2 November 2010, the Claimant and its controlling shareholder, Mr. Sawiris, caused the corporate organs of OTH to crystallize the dispute at the level of OTA's direct investor. [\u2026] Thus, on 2 November 2010, the legal protection that was available at the various levels of the corporate chain was activated at the OTH level. By exercising its right to arbitrate against Algeria, OTH placed itself in the position of being made whole for the alleged harm*.*61\n\nAward, paras. 496-497. Emphasis added.\n\n*(c) Analysis of OTMTI's alleged losses*\n----------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nIn the next step of its analysis, the Tribunal inquired whether OTMTI's claims were for losses that had not been incurred by OTH:\n\nThe Tribunal will thus review the losses that the Claimant alleges to have suffered as a result of Algeria's measures, with a view to examining whether the Claimant requests relief for losses that only itself suffered irrespective of the valuation of OTH. In this respect, OTMTI contends that \"at least part\" of the losses for which it seeks compensation in this arbitration were not sustained by OTH *.*62\n\nAward, para. 499.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal distinguished between five different heads of damages:\n\n1. The Tribunal held that OTMTI's \"claim for damages 'for the Claimant's realized losses on the sale of its investment' concerns the same economic harm as OTH's claim for diminution in value of its interest in OTA, which OTH raised in the OTH Arbitration\".63\n\n2. Regarding OTMTI's claim for its \"share of the unlawfully blocked OTA dividends\", the Tribunal first held that \"[w]ithin a vertical chain of corporations, each entity may pay out dividends to its shareholder(s), namely to the company or companies at the immediate higher echelon in the chain\"64 before concluding that OTMTI's \"claims for damages in relation to the dividends are identical to, and necessarily contained in, OTH's claims in the OTH Arbitration\".65\n\n3. Regarding OTMTI's claims for \"damages due to incremental payments that Claimant was obligated to pay to certain private equity investors [\u2026] because of the decrease in the value of Weather Investments, of which Claimant was the majority owner\",66 the Tribunal considered these claims inadmissible \"because these alleged losses derive primarily from the presence of put options in an agreement freely entered into by the Claimant\".67\n\n4. OTMTI's claim for consequential damages, which (according to OTMTI's expert) arose as a result of OTMTI's refinancing of its capital structure and measures to \"prevent a collapse of the Weather Group\",68 was found inadmissible on two grounds: first, the Tribunal held that OTMTI did not establish that OTMTI, as opposed to other entities of the Weather Group, had incurred these losses; second, any losses to prevent a collapse of the Weather Group \"must or should have been factored into the price when the Claimant sold Weather Investments\".69\n\n5. The Tribunal rejected OTMTI's claim for moral damages for alleged reputational harm as inadmissible because these losses \"if any, [were] incurred either by OTH or by Mr. Sawiris and not by itself\".70\n\nAward, para. 505. Emphasis added.\n\nAward, paras. 506-507. Emphasis added.\n\nAward, para. 508.\n\nAward, para. 509. Emphasis added.\n\nAward, para. 510.\n\nAward, para. 511.\n\nAward, para. 516.\n\nAward, para. 517. Footnote omitted.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that its analysis of the different heads of damages was informed by:\n\n[T]he Claimant's full memorial on the merits, the three expert reports presented by the Claimant's expert on valuation and damages analysis (two of which were filed specifically in the bifurcated phase dealing with the Respondent's preliminary objections), the extensive discussion on these issues at the Hearing, including the cross-examination of the Claimant's expert, as well as the record of the OTH Arbitration which has been produced in this arbitration *.*71\n\nAward, para. 499.\n\n104.\n\nAfter assessing OTMTI's different heads of damages, the Tribunal concluded that:\n\n[T]he claims before the Tribunal in reality seek reparation for losses covered by the requests for relief raised in the OTH Arbitration or for losses that the Claimant (owned and managed by an experienced businessman like Mr. Sawiris) must or should have factored into the sale of its investment to VimpelCom. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the claims are inadmissible *.*72\n\nAward, para. 518.\n\n*(d) Relevance of the settlement agreement between FNI, OTH and VimpelCom*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nRegarding the settlement agreement of April 18, 2014 between FNI, OTH and VimpelCom, the Tribunal concluded that it \"confirm[ed] that the Claimant's claims [we]re inadmissible\".73\n\nAward, para. 526.\n\n106.\n\nOn the facts, the Tribunal noted that:\n\nAfter the closing of the share purchase (which occurred on 30 January 2015), OTA, OTH and Algeria finally put an end to the domestic courts and arbitral proceedings, waiving all their claims. [\u2026] On the same day, OTH and Algeria addressed the \"Renunciation Letter\" informing the PCA tribunal in the OTH Arbitration that they had \"finally settled their dispute referred to arbitration\" in that proceeding. On 12 March 2015, the PCA tribunal issued a consent award recording the above agreement between the parties, which put an end to the OTH Arbitration *.*74\n\nAward, para. 522. Footnotes omitted.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal found that OTH, as direct shareholder of OTA, was the most obvious party to conclude a settlement agreement:\n\n[I]t comes as no surprise that [the settlement agreement] was entered into, inter alia, by OTH who also undertook a number of obligations on behalf of OTA. As already mentioned, OTH was the \"historical\" controlling shareholder of OTA, to which the GSM License was granted in 2001 (in the name and on behalf of OTA) and which negotiated and concluded the Investment Agreement in 2001 (in the name and on behalf of OTA). Furthermore, it was OTH which in 2009-2010 objected to the measures taken vis-\u00e0-vis OTA and which sent the first Notice of Dispute on 2 November 2010. At all times, OTH was and remained the direct and controlling shareholder of OTA. For all of those reasons, it was thus entirely logical for Algeria to negotiate with that foreign investor in the vertically integrated chain of companies *.*75\n\nAward, para. 523. Footnotes omitted.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal then went on to find that the settlement agreement is tantamount to an arbitral award in the OTH Arbitration and that it is irrelevant whether the content of the settlement is beneficial to OTH/OTA:\n\nIn these circumstances, the Claimant cannot bring claims in this arbitration that OTH decided to settle, as the settlement clearly resolved the dispute that the Claimant has brought before this Tribunal as is shown by the comparison of the notices of disputes above. The existence of a settlement agreement does not change the Tribunal's conclusions in relation to the OTH Arbitration, as the settlement stands in lieu of the investment treaty tribunal's award which would have been forthcoming in that arbitration. The settlement agreement puts an end to the dispute arising from Algeria's measures in the same manner as the award would have ended the dispute. In the absence of harm which it incurred itself to the exclusion of OTH, the Claimant cannot take over the dispute that OTH has settled. In this respect, the content of the settlement, whether beneficial or detrimental to OTH/OTA, is irrelevant. What matters is that the claims arising from Algeria's measures have ceased to exist due to the settlement agreement *.*76\n\nAward, para. 524.\n\n*(e) Relevance of OTMTI's sale of its controlling shareholding in OTH to VimpelCom*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal held that the fact that OTMTI had sold its indirect controlling shareholding in OTH to VimpelCom does not change its previous conclusion on the inadmissibility of OTMTI's claims:\n\nThe fact that the Claimant sold its investment does not change the conclusions reached above. If anything, it reinforces them. [\u2026] In the absence of harm it has suffered itself as opposed to OTH, any separate claims brought by the Claimant based on the same measures would have been inadmissible if it had remained in control of its investment. This being so, the sale of the investment cannot bestow on the seller more rights than it would have had if it had remained as a shareholder. [\u2026] [W]hen selling its investment, the Claimant could have carved out from the scope of the sale and reserved for itself the benefit of OTH's claim against Algeria. Absent such a carve out, the claim exercised by a subsidiary will benefit the buyer of the shares. In this case, by selling the shares in a company granting control over OTH (Weather Investments), the Claimant sold the claim that was attached to the shares in OTH *.*77\n\nAward, paras. 527-529.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal supported its analysis of the sales' impact by examining Mr. Sawiris' testimony at the Hearing on Preliminary Objections from May 26 to 30, 2015 (the \"**Hearing**\") who, when asked by Algeria's Counsel, accepted that OTH's or OTA's claim was sold with the shares and \"recognized that the price paid by the buyer must have included the claim to seek redress for Algeria's measures in relation to which OTH had already notified Algeria of a dispute\".78 Furthermore, the Tribunal briefly scrutinized the Risk Sharing Agreement and was \"unable to find anything [\u2026] that would support the view that the Claimant reserved its claim in relation to past measures\".79\n\nAward, para. 531.\n\nAward, para. 534. Emphasis omitted.\n\n**B. Abuse of Rights**\n----------------------\n\n111.\n\nWith regard to the doctrine of abuse of rights, the Tribunal found that:\n\n[A]n investor who controls several entities in a vertical chain of companies may commit an abuse [of rights] if it seeks to impugn the same host state measures and claims for the same harm at various levels of the chain in reliance on several investment treaties concluded by the host state. [\u2026] In the Tribunal's opinion, this conclusion derives from the purpose of investment treaties, which is to promote the economic development of the host state and to protect the investments made by foreigners that are expected to contribute to such development. If the protection is sought at one level of the vertical chain, and in particular at the first level of foreign shareholding, that purpose is fulfilled *.*80\n\nAward, paras. 542-543.\n\n112.\n\nOn the facts, the Tribunal quoted Mr. Sawiris' statement at the Hearing:\n\n[MR. SAWIRIS:] So when I was defending the interests of Orascom Telecom [Holding] [OTH] only, we would use the Egyptian treaty, because that's the instance now that is corresponding, and it's the direct. [\u2026] Then when things start to go worse, you say, \"Listen, guys, it's not go[ing] to end up there. There is an Italian treaty, so the mother company can go\". Then when I sell under the gun \u2013 and again I come to the different nature of my claim [\u2026] I used the Luxembourg treaty *.*81\n\nHearing Tr. Day 2 (May 27, 2015) [E], 189:21-190:13.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal then analyzed this statement concluding that:\n\n[A]s explained by Mr. Sawiris, the Claimant first caused one of its subsidiaries, OTH, to bring claims against Algeria. Then, it caused a different subsidiary in the chain, Weather Investments, to threaten to bring a different arbitration in relation to the same dispute. Finally \u2013 after selling the investment \u2013 it pursued yet another investment treaty proceeding in its own name for the same investment (its past shareholding in OTA) in relation to the same host state measures and the same harm *.*82\n\nAward, para. 545.\n\n114.\n\nThis led the Tribunal to find an abuse of rights \"which constitutes a further ground for the inadmissibility of the Claimant's claims\".83\n\nAward, para. 545.\n\n**C. Conclusive Remarks by the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nIn its conclusive remarks, the Tribunal emphasized that:\n\n[Its] conclusions on the inadmissibility of the claims are the result of the peculiar facts of the case, in which (i) the group of companies of which the Claimant was part was organized as a vertical chain; (ii) the entities in the chain were under the control of the same shareholder; (iii) the measures complained of by the various entities in the chain were the same and thus the dispute notified to Algeria by those entities was in essence identical; and (iv) the damage claimed by the various entities was, in its economic essence, the same.84\n\nAward, para. 546.\n\n**IV. THE APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS FOR ANNULMENT**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR ANNULMENT**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Applicant points out that the annulment mechanism under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention was designed to balance, on the one hand, the finality of awards and, on the other hand, the need to ensure the fundamental fairness and integrity of arbitration proceeding.85 As such, ICSID awards are not entitled to any presumption of validity.86\n\nReply, para. 32.\n\nReply, para. 34.\n\n117.\n\nAn award should undergo greater scrutiny where the annulment challenge relates to conclusions on jurisdiction or admissibility.87*Ad hoc* committees do not have \"full discretion\" not to annul the award in these circumstances because any failure to exercise jurisdiction, where jurisdiction exists, is a manifest excess of power.88\n\nReply, para. 34, referring to two expert opinions of Professor Paulsson.\n\nReply, para. 35.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent argues that one of the fundamental objectives of the ICSID Convention is to ensure the finality of arbitral awards, and the procedure of annulment is an exception made to this objective in order to protect the integrity and legitimacy of the proceeding and resulting award.89 The purpose of annulment proceedings excludes any *de novo* review of the merits and any substantive review of the award.90\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 209-210; Rejoinder, para. 206.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 213; Rejoinder, para. 208.\n\n119.\n\nMoreover, the *ad hoc* committee's analysis must be based on the record that was before the Tribunal.91 Even where it considers that a ground for annulment under Article 52(1) is materialized, *ad hoc* committees retain a discretion to annul the award. The Respondent cites with approval the view of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Tulip* v. *Turkey* that \"[u]nder the ordinary meaning of this provision, an *ad hoc* committee has some discretion and is not under an obligation to annul even if it finds that there is a ground for annulment listed in Article 52(1)\".92\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 215; Rejoinder, para. 209.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 216, citing *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V.* v. *Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28), Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, para. 45 (\"*Tulip* v. *Turkey*\").\n\n**C. Committee's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n*(a) Function of Annulment under the ICSID Convention*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe annulment under Article 52 of the Convention represents an exception to the principle of finality of the awards. That principle is embodied in Article 53(1) of the Convention according to which \"[t]he award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention\". The only remedies, envisaged in Section 5 of Chapter IV of the Convention, are interpretation, revision and annulment of the awards. The annulment process is not an appeal, it differs from it. It is not concerned with the substantive correctness of the award but with the integrity of the decision-making and the process which has led to the decision.93\n\nSee e.g., *MCI Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc.* v. *Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6), Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009, para. 24 (\"*MCI* v. *Ecuador*\"); *Total S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1), Decision on Annulment, February 1, 2016, para. 179 (\"*Total* v. *Argentina*\").\n\n121.\n\nAs the *ad hoc* Committee in *Tulip* v. *Turkey* explained that:\n\nIn any review process, two potentially conflicting principles are at work: the principle of finality and the principle of correctness. Finality serves the purpose of efficiency in terms of an expeditious and economical settlement of disputes. Correctness is an elusive goal that takes time and effort, and may involve several layers of control, a phenomenon that is familiar from proceedings in domestic courts. In arbitration, the principle of finality typically takes precedence over the principle of correctness *.*94\n\n*Tulip* v. *Turkey*, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, para. 40.\n\n122.\n\nThe main goal of the ICSID Convention is to assure the finality of the ICSID awards.95 Therefore, the drafters of the ICSID Convention opted for the model of a limited review. It is useful to recall what the *ad hoc* Committee in *CDC* v. *Seychelles* said about this review process:\n\nThis mechanism protecting against errors that threaten the fundamental fairness of the arbitral process (but not against incorrect decisions) arises from the ICSID Convention's drafters' desire that Awards be final and binding, which is an expression of \"customary law based on the concepts of *pacta sunt servanda* and *res judicata*,\" and is in keeping with the object and purpose of the Convention. Parties use ICSID arbitration (at least in part) because they wish a more efficient way of resolving disputes than is possible in a national court system with its various levels of trial and appeal, or even in non-ICSID Convention arbitrations (which may be subject to national courts' review under local laws and whose enforcement may also be subject to defenses available under, for example, the New York Convention). Procedural protections are, however, all the more necessary in order to ensure that the resulting award is truly an \"award,\" i.e., a result arrived at fairly, under due process and with transparency, and hence in the basic justice of which parties will have faith *.*96\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, para. 71.\n\n*CDC Group plc* v. *Republic of Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, para. 36 (\"*CDC* v. *Seychelles*\"). Footnotes omitted.\n\n123.\n\nAnnulment differs from appeal also in its possible outcome. The successful request for annulment may lead to the setting aside of the award, to its invalidation. The annulment committee has the power either to confirm the award or to annul it in whole or in part. It cannot substitute its decision for the decision under review that it has found to be deficient.97 An appeal, if successful, leads to the modification of the decision. An appellate organ may substitute its decision for the decision which was subject of an appeal.\n\nSee e.g., *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A.* v. *Republic of Chile*, Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007, para. 54 (\"*MTD* v. *Chile*\"); *Sociedad An\u00f3nima Eduardo Vieira* v. *Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/7), Decision on Annulment, December 10, 2010, para. 235 (\"*Vieira* v. *Chile*\").\n\n124.\n\nThe distinction between annulment and appeal has been emphasized by many *ad hoc* committees. They have stated consistently that their functions are limited and that they do not have the powers of a court of appeal.98 A decision to annul can be based on one or several of the five grounds listed in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.99 It is not the role of *ad hoc* committees to review tribunals' findings on facts or to control their interpretation of the applicable law.100\n\nSee e.g., *Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others* v. *United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2), Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, paras. 3, 83, 118, 128, 177 (\"*Kl\u00f6ckner* v. *Cameroon*\"); *Amco Asia Corporation and others* v. *Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/8 1/1), Decision on Annulment, May 16, 1986, paras. 43 and 110 (\"*Amco I* v. *Indonesia*\"); *Maritime International Nominees Establishment* v. *Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, paras. 5.08, 6.55 (\"*MINE* v. *Guinea*\"); *Wena Hotels Limited* v. *Arab Republic of Egyp t* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 18 (\"*Wena* v. *Egypt*\"); *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. & Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, para. 62 (\"*Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)*\"); *CDC* v. *Seychelles*, Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, paras. 35 and 36; *Repsol YPF Ecuador, S.A.* v. *Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10), Decision on Annulment, January 8, 2007, para. 38 ; *MTD* v. *Chile,* Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007, para. 52; *CMS Gas Transmission Company* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Annulment, September 25, 2007, paras. 43-44 (\"*CMS* v. *Argentina*\"); *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki* v. *United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7), Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, paras. 20 and 24 (\"*Soufraki* v. *UAE*\"); *Mr. Tza Yap Shum* v. *Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6), Decision on Annulment, February 12, 2015, para. 156.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner* v. *Cameroon*, Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, para. 3; *Wena* v. *Egypt*, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 17; *Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)*, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, para. 62.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner* v. *Cameroon*, Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, paras. 61 and 128; *Amco I* v. *Indonesia,* Decision on Annulment, May 16, 1986, para. 23; *CDC* v. *Seychelles* Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, para. 45; *CMS* v. *Argentina*, Decision on Annulment, September 25, 2007, paras. 85 and 136; *Tulip* v. *Turkey*, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, para. 44.\n\n*(b) Discretion to Annul*\n-------------------------\n\n125.\n\nAnother important aspect to keep in mind is that *ad hoc* committees retain a certain measure of discretion in exercising their power to annul an award. Under Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention: \"[t]he Committee shall have the authority to annul the award\". Under the ordinary meaning of this provision, an *ad hoc* committee has some discretion and is not under an obligation to annul even if it finds that there is a ground for annulment listed in Article 52(1).101 As the *ad hoc* Committee in *EDF* v. *Argentina* stated \"[t]o say that a committee 'shall have the authority to annul the award' is very different from saying that a committee 'shall annul the award'\".102 Decisions on applications for annulment confirm that even if a ground listed in Article 52(1) exists, annulment will ensue only if the flaw has had a serious adverse impact on one of the parties.103\n\nFor the discussion of this principle in early ICSID cases see: *Kl\u00f6ckner* v. *Cameroon*, Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, paras. 151 and 179; *Amco Asia Corporation and others* v. *Republic of Indonesia*, Decision on Annulment, December 3, 1992, para. 1.20 (\"*Amco II* v. *Indonesia*\"); *MINE* v. *Guinea*, Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, paras. 4.09-4.10; for more recent discussion see e.g., *Total* v. *Argentina*, Decision on Annulment, February 1, 2016, para. 167.\n\n*EDF International S.A., Saur International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23), Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2016, para. 73 (\"*EDF* v. *Argentina*\").\n\n*Tulip* v. *Turkey*, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, para. 45.\n\n126.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena* v. *Egypt* stressed that a ground for annulment must have had an effect on the outcome of the award and must have led to a substantially different result in order to actually lead to annulment.104 The *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)* cautioned that it \"must guard against the annulment of awards for trivial cause\".105 It stressed the discretion of committees and the practical significance of any error.106\n\nSee *Wena* v. *Egypt*, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, paras. 58 and 105.\n\n*Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)*, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, para. 63.\n\n*Ibid.* at para. 66. In the same sense: *Soufraki* v. *UAE*, Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, paras. 24 and 27; *CDC* v. *Seychelles*, Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, para. 37.\n\n127.\n\nIf one of the grounds listed in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention is established, an *ad hoc* committee still has to consider whether that ground had a material impact on the party seeking annulment.\n\n*(c) Principles Governing Annulment*\n------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe principles governing annulment under the Convention, as elaborated by several dozens of annulment committees, have usefully been summarized in the updated Background Paper on Annulment For the Administrative Council of ICSID.107 The *ad hoc* committees have affirmed the following six broad principles:\n\n1. The grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only grounds on which an award may be annulled;\n\n2. Annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of an *ad hoc* committee is limited;\n\n3. *Ad hoc* committees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision, and an *ad hoc* committee cannot substitute the Tribunal's determination on the merits for its own;\n\n4. *Ad hoc* committees should exercise their discretion not to defeat the object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and finality of awards;\n\n5. Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither narrowly nor broadly; and\n\n6. An *ad hoc* committee's authority to annul is circumscribed by the Article 52 grounds specified in the application for annulment, but an *ad hoc* committee has discretion with respect to the extent of an annulment, *i.e.*, either partial or full.\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment For the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, p. 32, para. 74.\n\n129.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention contains an exhaustive list of the following five grounds on which an award may be annulled:\n\n(a) That the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) That the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) That there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) That there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and\n\n(e) That the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n*(d) The Present Case*\n----------------------\n\n130.\n\nIn this proceeding, the Applicant seeks the partial annulment of the Award invoking three grounds. According to the Applicant, the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based.108 The Parties in the case at hand differ in their interpretation of the three grounds raised by the Applicant under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. The Committee will follow in its analysis the sequence of the grounds for annulment as invoked by the Applicant.\n\nApplication, Section III \u2013 Grounds for Annulment, pp. 13-27, paras. 28-60.\n\n**2. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Applicant recalls that Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention provides that an award may be annulled when the tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and notes that one of such fundamental rules is the right to be heard.109 As Professor Schreuer explains, \"the principle that both sides must be heard on all issues affecting their legal position is one of the most basic concepts of fairness in adversarial proceedings\".110 In *Wena* v. *Egypt*, the *ad hoc* Committee stated that the right to be heard \"includes the right to state its claim or its defense and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it\".111\n\nApplication, para. 28.\n\nApplication, para. 28, referring to C. H. Schreuer et al., *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2009), p. 987, para. 305.\n\nApplication, para. 29; *Wena* v. *Egypt*, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 57.\n\n132.\n\nThe full opportunity of presenting one's case includes the right of rebuttal.112 Not allowing one party a full opportunity to address late-raised issues, submits the Applicant, warrants annulment of the resulting award.113 In addition, \"[w]hile *ad hoc* committees have thus annulled awards where the tribunal denied both parties an opportunity to be heard, the same fundamental principles apply with even greater force where a tribunal materially prejudices only one party by denying it an opportunity to be heard\".114\n\nMemorial, paras. 71-72; Reply, para. 71.\n\nMemorial, paras. 73-78.\n\nMemorial, para. 79. Emphases omitted.\n\n133.\n\nThe Applicant posits the scope of annulment for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure must not be \"artificially restrict[ed]\", and in particular that the Applicant is not required to prove that there would have been a different outcome so as to annul the award.115 According to the Applicant, the Committee does not need to decide that Arbitration Rule 41(1) is itself a fundamental rule in order to find an annullable error.116 It asserts that numerous tribunals have dismissed untimely objections on the basis of Rule 41(1).117\n\nReply, paras. 71-72.\n\nReply, para. 73.\n\nReply, para. 74.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n134.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Applicant does not contest that the test for a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is two-fold: (1) the departure from the rule by the tribunal must be serious; and (2) the procedural rule in question must be fundamenta.118 On the first part, *ad hoc* committees have identified quantitative and qualitative criteria to assess the departure from a rule, confirming this departure must be substantial.119 On the second part, the fundamental rules of procedure envisaged by Article 52(1)(d) are only those which fall under principles of natural law.120\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 224; Rejoinder, para. 231.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 225; Rejoinder, para. 232.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 226-228; Rejoinder, para. 233.\n\n135.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Applicant is wrong in asserting that a violation of Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules constitutes *ipso facto* a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.121 On the contrary, while no *ad hoc* committee has yet ruled on the question of whether the requirement of Article 41(1) amounts to a fundamental rule of procedure, it is clear from the jurisprudence that this requirement is applied flexibly by tribunals and committees.122 In addition, *ad hoc* committees must also verify, in the light of the circumstances of each case, whether the adversarial principle has in fact been respected by tribunals.123\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 229; Rejoinder, paras. 235-236.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 229; Rejoinder, para. 236.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 230-232.\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that the respect of the adversarial principle must be assessed in the light of the function and powers of arbitral tribunals and, in particular, that: tribunals are under no obligation to draw the attention of a party to the fact that it has not fully exercised its right to be heard;124 tribunals can adopt a legal reasoning other than that of the parties so long as this reasoning falls into the \"legal framework\" constituted by them;125 and tribunals cannot base their decisions on evidence or legal concepts that one or both parties have never had the opportunity to debate and which did not fall within the legal framework established by the parties and therefore could not have been anticipated by them.126\n\nRejoinder, para. 242.\n\nRejoinder, para. 243.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 244-246.\n\n**C. Committee's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n137.\n\nThe respect for the fundamental rules of procedure is an important guarantee for the integrity and legitimacy of the arbitration procedure. Article 52(1)(d) recognizes this by providing that a party may request annulment of the award on the ground that \"there has been a serious departure from the fundamental rule of procedure\". This provision thus sets two requirements for this ground for annulment. First, the rule concerned must be fundamental and, second, the departure must be serious.\n\n*(a) Fundamental Rule*\n----------------------\n\n138.\n\nNot every departure from a rule of procedure will warrant an annulment. The rule in question needs to qualify as \"fundamental\". It appears from the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Convention that what the drafters had in mind are some basic principles \uf8e7 which may be called principles of natural justice \uf8e7 such as the parties' right to be heard, equal opportunity of each party to present its case and the opportunity to present its evidence and arguments and to respond to evidence and arguments of the other party.127 As some *ad hoc* committees have emphasized, fundamental rules of procedure are principles that are essential to a fair hearing.128\n\n*History of the ICSID Convention,* Vol. II, p. 480.\n\nSee e.g., *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited* v. *Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8), Decision on Annulment, May 22, 2013, para. 85 (\"*Libananco* v. *Turkey*\"); *Tulip* v. *Turkey*, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, para. 71.\n\n139.\n\nIt is to be recalled that the drafters of the Convention when proposing this ground for annulment were inspired by Article 35(c) of the Model Rules on Arbitral Procedure, prepared by the United Nations International Law Commission.129 In the Commentary on the Draft Convention on Arbitral Procedure, this provision was described as \"the principle that the tribunal must function in the manner of a judicial body and with respect for the fundamental rules governing the proceedings of any judicial body\".130 According to this Commentary, \"[t]he right to be heard, including due opportunity to present proofs and arguments\"131 is one of such fundamental rules of procedure.\n\n*Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1958*, Vol. II, p. 86.\n\nCommentary on the Draft Convention on Arbitral Procedure adopted by the International Law Commission at its Fifth Session (A/CN.4/92), p. 109. (United Nations publications, Sales No.: 1955.V.1).\n\n*Ibid*. at p. 110.\n\n140.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena* v. *Egypt* expressed the view that Article 52(1)(d) \"refers to a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected under international law\".132 It further elaborated that each party shall have \"the right to state its claim or its defense and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it\".133 And it continued: \"[t]his fundamental right has to be ensured on an equal level, in a way that allows each party to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other\".134\n\n*Wena* v. *Egypt*, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 57.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*(b) Serious Departure*\n-----------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe second requirement set forth in Article 52(1)(d) is that a departure from the fundamental rule of procedure must be \"seriou *s*\" in order to provide a basis for annulling an award. That view was already expressed by the International Law Commission according to which the rule concerns \"serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure rather than minor departures\".135 Various *ad hoc* committees held that not every departure from a rule of procedure justifies annulment. Thus, according to the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* v. *Guinea* \"the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide\".136\n\nCommentary on the Draft Convention on Arbitral Procedure adopted by the International Law Commission at its Fifth Session (A/CN.4/92), p. 109. (United Nations publications, Sales No.: 1955.V.1).\n\n*MINE* v. *Guinea*, Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, para. 5.05.\n\n142.\n\nAlthough some *ad hoc* committees examined whether the departure had a material impact on the outcome of the proceedings,137 this Committee believes that it is more appropriate to adopt, as did some other *ad hoc* committees, a more flexible approach and to consider whether the award might have been substantially different, in other words to examine a potential effect of the departure from the fundamental rule of procedure on the award.138 This approach was also followed with approval by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Tulip* v. *Turkey* when it stated that \"[t]o require an applicant to prove that the award would actually have been different, had the rule of procedure been observed, may impose an unrealistically high burden of proof\".139 And it continued: \"[w]here a complex decision depends on a number of factors, it is almost impossible to prove with certainty whether the change of one parameter would have altered the outcome. Therefore, an applicant must demonstrate that the observance of the rule had the *potential* of causing the tribunal to render an award substantially different from what it actually decided\".140 It further added that \"in order to be serious, the departure must be more than minimal. It must be substantial. It must have deprived the affected party of the benefit of the rule in question\".141\n\nSee e.g., *El Paso Energy International Company* v. *Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15), Decision on Annulment, September 22, 2014, para. 269 (\"*El Paso* v. *Argentina*\").\n\nSee e.g., *Wena* v. *Egypt*, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 61; *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation* v. *Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on Annulment, December 18, 2012, para. 78; *Caratube International Oil Company LLP* v. *Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12), Decision on Annulment, February 21, 2014, para. 99 (\"*Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan*\").\n\n*Tulip* v. *Turkey*, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, para. 78.\n\n*Ibid*. Emphasis in the original.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n143.\n\nA similar approach was taken by the *ad hoc* Committee in *TECO* v. *Guatemala*. It expressed the view that:\n\nRequiring an applicant to show that it would have won the case or that the result of the case would have been different if the rule of procedure had been respected is a highly speculative exercise. An annulment committee cannot determine with any degree of certainty whether any of these results would have occurred without placing itself in the shoes of a tribunal, something which is not within its powers to do. What a committee can determine, however, is whether the tribunal's compliance with a rule of procedure could potentially have affected the award *.*142\n\n*TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC* v. *Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23), Decision on Annulment, April 5, 2016, para. 85 (\"*TECO* v. *Guatemala*\").\n\n*(c) The Right to Be Heard*\n---------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the right to be heard belongs to the category of the fundamental rules of procedure. In accordance with the right to be heard, the parties shall be given the opportunity to present all the arguments and all the evidence that they deem relevant and to respond to arguments and evidence submitted by their opponent. In particular, each party must be given the opportunity to address every formal motion before the tribunal and every legal issue raised by the other party. The purpose of various provisions of the ICSID Arbitration Rules is to provide for and guarantee this right.143\n\nSee especially ICSID Arbitration Rules 20-21, 31-32, 37, 39-42, 44, 49-50, 54.\n\n145.\n\nThe implications of this right are, however, sometimes disputed. For instance, *ad hoc* committees have had to deal with the question of whether there was a violation of a party's right to be heard if the tribunal had based its decision on a theory that the parties had not fully discussed.144\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner* v. *Cameroon* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2), Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, paras. 89-91; *Wena* v. *Egypt*, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, paras. 66-70; *Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)*, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, paras. 82-85; *Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan*, Decision on Annulment, February 21, 2014, paras. 90-96; *El Paso* v. *Argentina*, Decision on Annulment, September 22, 2014, paras. 278-286.\n\n146.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan* stated that:\n\n[T]ribunals do not violate the parties' right to be heard if they ground their decision on the legal reasoning not specifically advanced by the parties, provided that the Tribunal's arguments can be fitted within the legal framework argued during the procedure and therefore concern aspects on which the parties could reasonably be expected to comment, if they wished their views to be taken into account by the tribunal *.*145\n\n*Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan*, Decision on Annulment, February 21, 2014, para. 94.\n\n147.\n\nThat Committee also observed that \"surprise [as far as the legal solution is concerned] does not give rise to a ground for annulment\".146 In support of its view, it relied on the statement of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)* that:\n\nIt may be true that the particular approach adopted by the Tribunal in attempting to reconcile the various conflicting elements of the case before it came as a surprise to the parties, or at least to some of them. But even if true, this would by no means be unprecedented in judicial decision-making, either international or domestic, and it has nothing to do with the ground for annulment contemplated by Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.147\n\n*Ibid*. at para. 96.\n\n*Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)*, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, para. 84.\n\n148.\n\nThis Committee considers this approach reasonable and well-grounded in international judicial practice.148\n\nSee e.g., *Northern Cameroons (Cameroon* v. *United Kingdom)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 15; *Nuclear Tests (Australia* v. *France)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 253; *Nuclear Tests (New Zealand* v. *France)*, Judgment, I.C.J.

Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n149.\n\nThe Applicant sets forth that a tribunal manifestly exceeds its powers, *inter alia*, if it fails to exercise jurisdiction where it exists or to apply the proper law.149 An excess of powers is manifest when it can be discerned with little effort.150 When applying the law, the Tribunal may not invent it or replace it with its own personal policy preferences.151\n\nApplication, paras. 34-36; Memorial, para. 58.\n\nMemorial, para. 59.\n\nMemorial, paras. 62-64; Reply, para. 54; A. PHB1, para. 12.\n\n150.\n\nOn the relevant standard under Article 52(1)(b), the Applicant makes the following observations: an excess of power can be manifest if it can \"readily be discerned\", although this may occasionally require an *ad hoc* annulment committee to undertake an \"elaborate analysis\";152 an *ad hoc* annulment committee is entitled to examine the \"factual and legal premises\" upon which the tribunal's decision is based;153 and a tribunal commits an excess of powers by the \"manifest and consequential non-exercise of [its] full powers\".154\n\nReply, para. 39.

Annulment Hearing Tr. Day 1 (May 27, 2019) [E] 24:6-7.\n\nReply, paras. 53-55.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent argues that only a manifest excess of power which is \"obvious, evident, clear\" warrants the annulment of the award.159 If a certain degree of analysis may be necessary to understand \"what the tribunal has decided\", an excess of power cannot be characterized as manifest when it is not \"sufficiently clear and grave\" or when it cannot \"readily be discerned\".160\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 330-332, 334.\n\nRejoinder, para. 381. Footnotes omitted.\n\n153.\n\nWith respect to the failure to exercise jurisdiction, the Respondent points out that the ICSID Convention does not permit a *de novo* review of the tribunal's jurisdictional ruling.161 No *ad hoc* committee has ruled yet on whether an erroneous decision on admissibility may amount to an excess of power.162 Yet, the Applicant fails to distinguish between situations where the subject-matter of the application for annulment is not the jurisdiction of the tribunal (and thus concerns the existence and scope of its powers), and the admissibility of the parties' claims (and thus concerns the exercise of its jurisdictional power).163 In any case, an *ad hoc* committee cannot review the factual premises on which the tribunal based its decision;164 and an *ad hoc* committee cannot annul an award if the tribunal's disposition of a question of law is \"tenable\".165\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 338-340.\n\nRejoinder, para. 390.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 386-390; R. RHB1, para. 31.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 392-395.\n\nRejoinder, para. 396.\n\n154.\n\nWith respect to the failure to apply the proper law, the Respondent sets forth that an arbitral tribunal cannot be criticized for having applied the law agreed to by the parties,166 especially when their agreement concerns a body of rules without setting a hierarchy between them.167 Once the *ad hoc* committee has identified the law applicable to the question in debate, it must ascertain whether the tribunal has endeavoured to apply that law to the circumstances of the case168 or whether it consciously ignored the applicable law.169 The Respondent argues that the Applicant conflates, on the one hand, the control of the tribunal's endeavour to apply the proper law, and, on the other hand, the control of the tribunal's finding on the content of the applicable law.170 The latter is impermissible in that it would constitute an appeal.171\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 347.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 348-349.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 350.\n\nRejoinder, para. 430.\n\nRejoinder, para. 409.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 423-434.\n\n**C. Committee's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n155.\n\nUnder Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, a party may request annulment of the award on the ground \"that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers\". The *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* demonstrate that the intention of the drafters of the Convention was to cover the situation where the Tribunal's decision went beyond the terms of the parties' arbitration agreement.172 This ground covers a situation when a tribunal decides the dispute although under the terms of the arbitration agreement it lacks jurisdiction over the claims submitted to it by a claimant. It may also cover a situation when a tribunal fails to exercise its jurisdiction. The *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)*, in a frequently quoted passage, observed:\n\nIt is settled [\u2026] that an ICSID Tribunal commits an excess of powers not only if it exercises jurisdiction which it does not have under the relevant agreement or treaty and the ICSID Convention, but also if it fails to exercise a jurisdiction which it possesses under those instruments. One might qualify this by saying that it is only where the failure to exercise a jurisdiction is capable of making a difference to the result that it can be considered a manifest excess of power. Subject to that qualification, however, the failure by a tribunal to exercise a jurisdiction given it by the ICSID Convention and a BIT in circumstances where the outcome of the inquiry is affected as a result, amounts in the Committee's view to a manifest excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) *.*173\n\nUnless there is a legally relevant reason for a tribunal to refrain from exercising jurisdiction it possesses, a tribunal declining to exercise it exceeds its powers.\n\nSee *History of the ICSID Convention*, Vol. II, p. 517.\n\n*Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)*, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, para. 86. See also *Soufraki* v. *UAE*, Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, para. 43; *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa*, *S.A.* (*formerly Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Per\u00fa, S.A.*) v. *Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4), Decision on Annulment, September 5, 2007, para. 99 (\"*Lucchetti* v. *Peru*\"); *Fraport AG Frankfurt Services Worldwide* v. *Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25), Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, paras. 36-37 (\"*Fraport* v. *The Philippines*\").\n\n156.\n\nIn the present case, while the Tribunal rejected the Respondent's objections to its jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae* in the reasoning part of the Award,174 it decided that \"[t]he claims raised in this arbitration are inadmissible and the Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute\".175\n\nAward, paras. 314-315, 324, 385. As noted above (para. 91), the Tribunal in view of its conclusion that the claims are inadmissible did not consider it necessary to deal with the remaining jurisdictional objections that the acts of the State-owned television provider are not attributable to the Respondent and the \"purely contractual claims\" relating to the Investment Agreement do not fall within its jurisdiction.\n\nAward, Chapter VIII entitled Decision, para. 587(a). This formulation implicitly confirms that the Tribunal possessed jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n157.\n\nThe Committee will have to review whether there were indeed legal reasons for the Tribunal to refrain from the exercise of its jurisdiction in order to determine whether it has manifestly exceeded its powers as contended by the Applicant.\n\n**4. FAILURE TO STATE REASONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Applicant notes that Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention provides that an award may be annulled if it fails to state the reasons on which it is based. It refers to the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* v. *Guinea* which noted that the award must enable \"one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion\".176 The requirement to state reasons \u2014 \"one of the central duties of arbitral tribunals\"177 \u2014 extends to the tribunal's duty to consider and to respond to the arguments presented by the parties, especially those highly relevant to their case.178\n\nApplication, para. 52; Memorial, para. 65; *MINE* v. *Republic of Guinea,* Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, para. 5.09.

Emphasis omitted.\n\n160.\n\nThe Applicant emphasizes four points regarding the reasons requirement: missing reasons can be inferred or reconstructed, but only when there is a reasonable basis to do so in the specific terms of the award;180 inadequate, frivolous, unintelligible, or contradictory reasons justify annulment;181 arguments and evidence with \"the *potential* to be relevant to the final outcome of the case\" must be considered and addressed by the tribunal;182 and a tribunal is *not* presumed to have considered the parties' arguments and evidence when they are accurately summarized in the award.183\n\nReply, para. 58.\n\nMemorial, para. 66; Reply, paras. 61-66.\n\nReply, paras. 67-69, citing *TECO* v. *Guatemala,* Decision on Annulment, April 5, 2016, paras. 135 and 138. Emphasis in the original.\n\nReply, para. 70; A. PHB1, para. 13.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Respondent states that there is no cause for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) when the terms of the award allow the parties to understand the tribunal's reasoning.184 In addition, the reasons in the award are assessed in the light of the parties' arguments and evidence and can derive implicitly from the terms used in the award.185 The tribunal is not obliged to address all arguments and documents submitted by the parties, in particular when these do not affect the decision or when the reasons provided by a tribunal directly contradict them.186 Lastly, to be annullable, genuinely contradictory reasons must be incapable of standing together on any reasonable reading of the decision.187\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 429-431.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 429-431.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 434-435.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 440-441.\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondent also makes the following three observations: Article 52(1)(e) does not empower *ad hoc* committees to sanction the allegedly \"inadequate or defective\" (\"*inappropri\u00e9 ou d\u00e9fectueux*\") nature of the reasoning of an award;188 the tribunal's reasoning can be implicit from a reading of the award as a whole;189 and the failure of the award to deal with every question submitted to the tribunal is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).190\n\nRejoinder, paras. 507-512.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 513-517.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 518-523.\n\n**C. Committee's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n163.\n\nA tribunal has an obligation under Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention to state the reasons upon which its award is based.191 Failure to comply with this obligation is a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\nThis requirement is restated in ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i).\n\n164.\n\nThe purpose of this provision is to guarantee that a tribunal gives reasons for its award. It has to explain to the reader, in particular to the parties, how and why the tribunal reached its decision. However, Article 48(3) does not require discussion of arguments which have no impact on the award.192\n\n*Standard Chartered Bank* v. *United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12), Award, November 2, 2012, paras. 273-275.\n\n165.\n\nIt is, however, to be observed that it is one thing to state the reasons in the award and to explain to the parties the basis for the tribunal's decision, and why and how it was reached, and quite another whether the reasons given would convince the parties, in particular the party which has not prevailed, about the correctness of the decision and the reasons given in its support. The correctness of the reasoning is not relevant for the purpose of annulment and the *ad hoc* committees are not expected to review this aspect of the reasoning. Otherwise they would act as an appellate body. The *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi* v. *Argentina (II)* stated that:\n\n[T]he issue before this Committee is not to assess the accuracy or quality of the reasons given by the Tribunal but rather to review whether these reasons enable the reader to understand why the Tribunal reached the conclusions that were determinative for its decision(s).193\n\nA number of *ad hoc* committees have expressed a similar view.194\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19), Decision on Annulment, May 5, 2017, para. 154 (\"*Vivendi* v. *Argentina (II)*\").\n\nSee *e.g.*, *MCI* v. *Ecuador*, Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009, para. 82; *Vieira* v. *Chile*, Decision on Annulment, December 10, 2010, para. 355; *Joseph Charles Lemire* v. *Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18), Decision on Annulment, July 8, 2013, para. 278; *Impregilo S.p.A.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17), Decision on Annulment, January 24, 2014, para. 180 (\"*Impregilo* v. *Argentina*\"); *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company* v. *The Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on Annulment, November 2, 2015, para. 66; *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula and others* v. *Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20), Decision on Annulment, February 26, 2016, para. 135; *TECO* v. *Guatemala*, Decision on Annulment, April 5, 2016, para. 124.\n\n166.\n\nThe classic formula for the requirements of reasons, which the Parties in the present annulment proceeding also referred to was provided by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE* v. *Guinea* :\n\nThe Committee is of the opinion that the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e), because it almost inevitably draws an ad hoc Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal's decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention. A Committee might be tempted to annul an award because that examination disclosed a manifestly incorrect application of the law, which, however, is not a ground for annulment.\n\nIn the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons *.*195\n\n*MINE* v. *Guinea*, Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989, paras. 5.08, 5.09.\n\n167.\n\nRelying on these statements, the *ad hoc* Committee in *Tulip* v. *Turkey* explained that \"the standard merely requires that the reader can understand what motivated the tribunal. As long as an *ad hoc* committee can follow the reasons, it is irrelevant what it thinks of their quality\".196\n\n*Tulip* v. *Turkey*, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, para. 101.\n\n168.\n\nThe view to the same effect was expressed by several *ad hoc* Committees. Thus the *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena* v. *Egypt* wrote:\n\nThe ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the *ad hoc* Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal's decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not. As stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in *MINE*, this ground for annulment refers to a \"minimum requirement\" only. This requirement is based on the Tribunal's duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the Tribunal to its decision. If such sequence of reasons has been given by the Tribunal, there is no room left for a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) *.*197\n\n*Wena* v. *Egypt*, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2002, para. 79.\n\n169.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)* said:\n\n[I]t is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52 (1)(e) concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. It bears reiterating that an *ad hoc* committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning *.*198\n\n*Vivendi* v. *Argentina (I)*, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002, para. 64. Emphasis in the origin a l. Footnote omitted.\n\n170.\n\nSubsequent *ad hoc* committees have since adopted this standard.199 It follows that the role of this Committee under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is not to inquire whether the reasons provided by the Tribunal in its Award are correct as a matter of law or whether they are convincing but to satisfy itself that the reasons given enable the reader to understand how and why the Tribunal arrived at its decision.\n\n*CDC* v. *Seychelles*, Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, paras. 66-75; *Mr. Patrick Mitchell* v. *Democratic Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7), Decision on Annulment, November 1, 2006, para. 21; *MTD* v. *Chile*, Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007, para. 92; *Soufraki* v. *UAE*, Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, para. 134; *Lucchetti* v. *Peru*, Decision on Annulment, September 5, 2007, paras. 127-128; *Azurix Corp.* v. *The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Annulment, September 1, 2009, paras. 53-56, 178; *MCI* v. *Ecuador,* Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009, paras. 82 and 86; *Fraport* v. *The Philippines*, Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, paras. 272 and 277; *Continental Casualty Company* v. *The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9)*,* Decision on Annulment, September 16, 2011, para. 100; *Libananco* v. *Turkey*, Decision on Annulment, May 22, 2013, paras. 90-94; *Impregilo* v. *Argentina*, Decision on Annulment, January 24, 2014, paras. 180-181; *Caratube* v. *Kazakhstan*, Decision on Annulment, February 21, 2014, paras. 101-102; *Alapli Elektrik B.V.* v. *Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/13), Decision on Annulment, July 10, 2014, paras. 197-199; *El Paso* v. *Argentina*, Decision on Annulment, September 22, 2014, paras. 217 and 235; *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 \u0130n\u015faat \u0130thalat \u0130hracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi* v. *Turkmenistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/1), Decision on Annulment, July 14, 2015, paras. 59-64.\n\n**V. TRIBUNAL'S FINDINGS THE ANNULMENT OF WHICH IS SOUGHT BY THE APPLICANT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Applicant invokes the following three grounds for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n(i) That the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b));\n\n(ii) That there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and\n\n(iii) That the Award failed to state the reasons upon which it is based (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n172.\n\nThese three grounds are invoked by the Applicant, in a twin combination, with respect to several findings of the Tribunal. According to the Applicant, the Tribunal:\n\n1. By holding that OTMTI's right to arbitrate had been extinguished by OTH's filing of a notice of dispute manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons for this conclusion;200\n\n2.

PHB1, paras. 14-36; A. PHB2, paras. 1-10.\n\n**1. THE ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONDENT'S \"EXTINGUISHMENT OF RIGHTS\" AND ABUSE OF RIGHTS OBJECTIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure and failed to state reasons when it accepted the Respondent's objections of \"extinguishment of OTMTI's rights\" and abuse of rights,205 and thus the corresponding part of the Award should be annulled.\n\nMemorial, paras. 188-189; Reply, paras. 169, 223. The Committee notes that the expression \"extinguishment of OTMTI's rights\" has been used by the Applicant; it is not the term used by the Tribunal in the Award. The Respondent used, in French, the expressions \"*le d\u00e9faut d'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*\" and \"*le d\u00e9faut de droit d'agir*\", Hearing Tr. Day 5 (May 30, 2015) [E] 162:22-23, R. PHB1, para. 19.\n\n*(a) Admissibility of the Respondent's \"Extinguishment of Rights\" and Abuse of Rights Objections*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Applicant complains that the Respondent unveiled the two preliminary objections for the very first time in its Closing Statement at the Hearing: first*,* the filing of OTH's Notice of Dispute under the Egypt-Algeria BIT \"extinguished\" the Claimant's claims under the BLEU-Algeria BIT; and, second, the Claimant had abused its rights to initiate arbitration proceeding under the latter BIT.206 At the Hearing, the Claimant stated that the Respondent's objections could not be taken seriously given how late in the proceeding they had been raised.207\n\nApplication, para. 31; Memorial, para. 194; A. PHB1, para. 15.\n\nMemorial, para. 194, citing Hearing Tr. Day 5 (May 30, 2015) [E] 196:22-197:16.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal, the Applicant contends, ignored its own prior instructions that the Respondent's preliminary objections should be stated at the latest in its Counter-Memorial.208 The Tribunal admitted and accepted the Respondent's objections without acknowledging the Claimant's objection as to their timeliness.209 The Respondent's two objections do not reflect an \"evolution\" or \"refinement\" of previously raised arguments (as the record shows),210 and they could have been elaborated prior to the close of the Hearing (since the Respondent was at all times fully aware of the nature and extent of the control that the Sawiris Family exercised over every entity in the Weather Group).211\n\nMemorial, para. 195, citing Procedural Order No. 2 of April 10, 2014, para. 32.\n\nMemorial, para. 195.\n\nReply, para. 170.\n\nReply, para. 182.\n\n177.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Respondent does not dispute that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for admitting its two preliminary objections.212 In addition, \"even if [the Claimant] had not raised repeated objections to Algeria's untimely new defenses, the Tribunal still should have stated the reasons why it chose to admit the defenses well outside of the time limits under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) and in contravention of its own orders\".213\n\nReply, para. 224.\n\nReply, para. 225. Emphasis omitted.\n\n178.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal's decision to permit the Respondent to introduce new preliminary objections at such a late stage constitutes a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.214 In addition, the Tribunal's failure to consider the Claimant's objections to the admissibility of the Respondent's objections, or to state reasons for its decision to reject those objections, constitutes a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.215\n\nReply, paras. 175-183.\n\nMemorial, para. 199.\n\n*(b) The Claimant's Right to Be Heard and the Treatment of Parties*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Applicant complains that the post-hearing procedure did not afford it with an equal or adequate opportunity to address what ultimately were the dispositive issues in the Award.216 The Claimant was \"unfairly and improperly limited\" to respond in the \"materially abbreviated manner and timeframe\" permitted by post-hearing submissions, and thus was not able to adduce factual evidence, testimony, or legal authorities (other than publicly available cases).217 Moreover, the Tribunal failed to give the Claimant an adequate opportunity to address the Respondent's preliminary objections, as well as the opportunity to discuss the two authorities not in the record but cited in the Award, which it contends, had a particular significance to the outcome of the case.218\n\nApplication, para. 33; A. PHB1, para. 21.\n\nApplication, para. 33; Memorial, paras. 200-204.\n\nMemorial, paras. 200-213.\n\n180.\n\nThe Applicant further submits that the Claimant agreed to the post-hearing submissions before the Respondent made its new preliminary objections, and its first true opportunity to respond to the Respondent's objections came only in the post-hearing reply;219 that the Tribunal's \"expressly imposed significant constraints\" on the post-hearing briefs precluded the Claimant from adequately rebutting the very objections to which the Tribunal later accorded dispositive weight;220 that the Tribunal's \"expressed specific interest in other issues\" and its proposed opportunities to address those underscore the inadequacy of the procedure with respect to the Respondent's new and untimely objections;221 and that a tribunal's discretion based on the principle of *jura novit curia* to rely on authorities not in the record is subject to important limits.222\n\nReply, paras. 185-188.\n\nReply, paras. 189-191.\n\nReply, paras. 192-198. Emphasis omitted.\n\nReply, paras. 199-201.\n\n181.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tribunal's decision to dismiss the Claimant's claims based on the Respondent's untimely objections violated the Claimant's right to be heard and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and therefore this part of the Award is annullable.223\n\nMemorial, para. 200.\n\n*(c) Alleged Waiver of the Applicant's Right to Raise an Article 52(1)(d) Ground*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Applicant asserts it did not waive the right to object to the Tribunal's serious departures from a fundamental rule of procedure, relying on two bases.224\n\nReply, paras. 202-204.\n\n183.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal's serious departures were not fully known or knowable until the issuance of the Award: \"[t]he weight that the Tribunal assigned to Algeria's late extinguishment of rights and abuse of rights objections\u2014and the true nature and impact of the impairment of OTMTI's right to be heard on those issues\u2014could not have been known until after the Award was issued\".225 Accordingly, there has been no waiver under Rule 27 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules of the right to seek annulment.226\n\nReply, para. 207.\n\nReply, para. 208.\n\n184.\n\nSecond, the Claimant repeatedly objected to the Respondent's defenses. The Claimant raised a Rule 41(1) objection to the admissibility of the Respondent's defenses in the arbitration.227 In any event, the Respondent acknowledges, \"[t]here is no requirement as to form [for objections] set out in Arbitration Rule 27\".228 Further, the Claimant repeatedly and consistently highlighted the fundamentally improper nature of the Respondent's late objections, including in the Hearing on preliminary objections, Post-Hearing Briefs, post-hearing correspondence, and submissions on costs.229\n\nApplication, para. 32; Memorial, paras. 194 and 217, citing Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief in the arbitration, para. 169; Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief in the arbitration, paras. 91-92; Letter from OTMTI to the Tribunal dated November 28, 2015, at p. 2; Claimant's Submission on Costs in the arbitration, para. 12.\n\nReply, para. 211; citing Counter-Memorial, para. 287, fn. 287 (quoting Thomas H.

See also footnote 227 above.\n\n185.\n\nIn consequence, the Applicant preserved its right to challenge the Tribunal's late admission of those defenses and related violations of its right to be heard.230\n\nReply, paras. 203-204.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the adversarial principle and the equal treatment of the Parties were respected at each stage of the arbitration procedure, including at the Hearing and in the post-hearing phase, and thus the Tribunal did not seriously depart from a fundamental rule of procedure.231 The Applicant's claims based on Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention should therefore fail.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 220-223.\n\n*(a) Admissibility of the Respondent's Lack of Standing (\"D\u00e9faut d'Int\u00e9r\u00eat pour Agir\") and Abuse of Rights Objections*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, its preliminary objections to jurisdiction and admissibility were timely.232 The Respondent's objections were made at the beginning of the procedure and then refined and fully developed in the course of the proceeding to take into account new evidence added to the record.233\n\nRejoinder, para. 284.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 239-240; R. PHB1, para. 17.\n\n188.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent raised its concerns to the Tribunal regarding the situation of double recovery (\"*situation de double emploi*\") from multiple claims and the complete opacity of the Claimant regarding the vertical chain of ownership from the early stages of the arbitration proceeding up to the decision on bifurcation.234 Notably, at the Hearing on Bifurcation, the Respondent answered the request of a Tribunal member by confirming it intended to bring forward an objection based on the abuse of rights depending on the evidence it would gather in the arbitration proceeding.235 In response, the Claimant acknowledged that an abuse of procedure would need to be assessed in light of the specific facts of the case.236\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 241-243.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 259-262, referring to Bifurcation Hearing Tr. (March 26, 2014) [F] pp. 20:15-22:32. In the transcript of the interpretation into English, the passage appears at 50:18-55:21.\n\nRejoinder, para. 263, referring to Bifurcation Hearing Tr. (March 26, 2014) [E] 58:21 \u2013 60:2.\n\n189.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent stresses that new evidence adduced throughout the arbitration proceeding and in particular that which emerged from the examination of Mr. Sawiris at the Hearing, uncovered the abuse of rights.237 This evidence brought to light the situation of double recovery (\"*situation de double emploi*\") stemming from the submission to arbitration of the same dispute by the Mr. Sawiris at different levels of the vertically integrated corporate chain.238 Mr. Sawiris acknowledged that when he sold the shares of OTH to VimpelCom, he also gave up the right of action of OTH against the Respondent because the price included the evaluation of OTH's claim initiated by the Notice of Dispute dated November 2, 2010.239\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 245-247.\n\nRejoinder, para. 285.\n\nRejoinder, para. 278, referring to Hearing Tr. Day 2 (May 27, 2015) [E] 170:3-14 and 173: 16-19.\n\n190.\n\nAs a result, from the Respondent's view, the Applicant cannot reasonably argue that the objections to admissibility upheld by the Tribunal were untimely and warrant partial annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.240\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 249; Rejoinder, para. 287.\n\n*(b) The Claimant's Right to be Heard and the Treatment of the Parties*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with the Applicant's characterization of the Hearing and the Post-Hearing Briefs, asserting that the Applicant had full knowledge of the objections to admissibility and had an adequate opportunity to rebut them.241 At the Hearing, the Claimant did not object when its witnesses and experts were questioned on, among others, the existence of its own harm, the effect of the OTH settlement agreement, and the abuse of rights principle.242 In its Closing Statement, the Claimant specifically addressed the abuse of rights principle, stating this argument was not \"serious\" in the present case.243 At the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties agreed on the submission of two post-hearing briefs and jointly determined the terms of these briefs, without complaint from the Claimant on any aspect of the arbitral procedure.244\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 250; Rejoinder, paras. 228 and 288.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 254.\n\nRejoinder, para. 293, referring to Hearing Tr.

The Respondent recalls that the *ad hoc* Committee in *Fraport* noted that \"[a] full opportunity to present one's case does not preclude a tribunal from setting reasonable limits on the timing and scale of both parties' submissions, provided that, in so doing, it affords the parties equality of treatment\".245 In its Post-Hearing Briefs, the Claimant stated the OTH Arbitration was \"irrelevant\" and addressed the situation of double recovery (\"*situation de double emploi*\"), even submitting sources of law in support of its contentions.246 The Tribunal did not completely forbid the submission of factual evidence and legal authorities, as the Applicant incorrectly asserts, but only required that those be authorized by it beforehand.247\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 260; Rejoinder, para. 299, citing *Fraport* v. *The Philippines*, Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, para. 265. Emphasis omitted.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 313-314.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 316-317.\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent also states that the Tribunal did ensure that the adversarial principle was respected at every stage of the arbitration proceeding, including at the Hearing and in the Post-Hearing Briefs.248 Contrary to the Applicant's affirmation, the Tribunal did not have to warn the Parties that it was inclined to uphold two preliminary objections and to grant the Claimant an additional opportunity to present its arguments on these objections.249 Moreover, the Respondent argues, in the many procedural incidents initiated by the Claimant in the arbitration proceeding, where the Claimant initially refused to comply with the Tribunal's instructions and subsequently alleged a violation of the adversarial principle, the Tribunal allowed both Parties to formulate their arguments under the same conditions.250 As the Tribunal accepted the Claimant's argument that \"the Tribunal may apply the maxim *jura no[v]it curia* (or *jura novit arbiter*) and rely on any applicable legal authorities it deems relevant to its analysis\",251 the Applicant cannot now reasonably criticize the Tribunal for having granted the Respondent's abuse of rights objection while referring, *inter alia*, to extracts from two scholarly publications which were not debated.252 Consequently, in upholding the Respondent's objections, the Tribunal treated the Parties equally and respected the Claimant's right to be heard.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 263-264, 275; Rejoinder, para. 320.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 267.\n\nRejoinder, para. 326.\n\nAward, para. 140.\n\nRejoinder, para. 327.\n\n*(c) Alleged Waiver of the Applicant's Right to Raise an Article 52(1)(d) Ground*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Applicant failed to raise in due course its objections to the alleged procedural irregularities it now mentions in support of its request to partially annul the Award.253 More precisely, the Applicant forfeited its rights to invoke these alleged irregularities pursuant to Rules 27 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.254\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 283.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 336-337.\n\n195.\n\nThe Respondent submits that in the absence of a procedural objection raised during the arbitration proceeding alleging a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, where the party either requested the tribunal to remedy the situation or formulated a reservation, an applicant is deprived of its right to invoke this departure in support of its annulment application based on an Article 52(1)(d) ground.255\n\nRejoinder, para. 343.\n\n196.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Applicant mischaracterizes the record by affirming it formulated in the arbitration proceeding a request under Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to reject the Respondent's objections.256 On the contrary, the Claimant limited itself to arguing that the Respondent's objections upheld by the Tribunal had been raised for the first time at the Hearing and then tried to show that these objections were unfounded, without any criticism of their admissibility.257 Accordingly, the Applicant cannot fault the Tribunal for not having considered (or rejected without justification) a procedural objection that it never submitted to the Tribunal.258\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 297.\n\nRejoinder, para. 351.\n\nRejoinder, para. 352.\n\n197.\n\nThe Applicant attempts to artificially qualify the extent of its knowledge of alleged violations, stating they \"[w]ere [n]ot [f]ully [k]nown [o]r [k]nowable\" during the arbitration proceeding, and only \"became evident\" when the Award was issued.259 However, a party needs not to wait until the award is issued to realize that there was a procedural violation in the conduct of the arbitration process and must promptly submit its objections (or, at least, before the rendering of the award).260 Yet, the Claimant did not raise any objection during the various stages of the procedure which followed, nor expressed any reservation in this regard.261\n\nRejoinder, para. 362. Emphasis omitted.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 366-369.\n\nRejoinder, para. 370.\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, pursuant to Rules 27 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Applicant is deprived of the right to invoke the alleged procedural irregularities in an attempt to characterize a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. For the above reasons, the Applicant's partial annulment request based on Article 52(1)(d) can only be dismissed.262\n\nRejoinder, para. 374.\n\n**C. Committee's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n199.\n\nIn the view of the Committee, three distinct issues arise in relation to the alleged serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure:\n\n(a) The issue of whether OTMTI is barred from invoking the alleged procedural irregularities by failing to promptly object to the conduct of the proceeding;\n\n(b) The issue of whether Algeria's admissibility objections as to the lack of OTMTI's standing (\"*d\u00e9faut d'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*\") and the abuse of rights were untimely; and\n\n(c) The issue of whether OTMTI was given sufficient opportunity to defend itself against these objections and whether its right to be heard was respected.\n\n*(a) Alleged Waiver of OTMTI's right to raise an Article 52(1)(e) ground complaining of the conduct of the proceeding*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent argues that OTMTI shall be deemed to have waived its right to invoke the alleged irregularities in the conduct of the proceeding as a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention since it did not promptly state its objection to the alleged non-compliance with the Arbitration Rules, as required by Rule 27 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.263\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 283. ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 provides that *\"* [a] party which knows or should have known that a provision of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, of these Rules, of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceeding, or of an order of the Tribunal has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed\u2014subject to Article 45 of the Convention\u2014to have wa ived its right to object\".\n\n201.\n\nThe Committee is not convinced that OTMTI waived its right to seek annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention in relation to the treatment by the Tribunal of the two objections raised by the Respondent with regard to the admissibility of the claims. First, counsel for the Claimant noted in her Closing Statement that \"[w]e heard a couple of new arguments this morning: in part, that there are too many people that might be able to claim [\u2026] We also heard for the very first time today about the alleged abuse of rights\".264 When asked before the closure of the Hearing whether she had any complaints, counsel simply replied: \"I am trying to remember all the procedural orders!\"265 Second, in its Post-Hearing Briefs, OTMTI emphasized again that the Respondent argued for the very first time at the Hearing that the commencement of the OTH Arbitration deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction.266 Although OTMTI did not refer specifically in this context to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), it, however, expressly invoked that Rule when it addressed Respondent's argument, advanced according to the OTMTI \"for the very first time\" at the Hearing, that, because the \"Claimant's investment at issue [was] 0.05 percent indirect shareholding in OTA [\u2026] on the date it submitted its claim to arbitration\",267 the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction. OTMTI considered this to be the \"Respondent's newfound objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the whole of Claimant's investment [which was] both untimely and legally baseless\".268 OTMTI, quoting ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1), expressed the view that the objection was untimely and therefore \"should [\u2026] be rejected by the Tribunal on this ground\".269\n\nHearing Tr.

The transcript of the interpretation differs a little bit: \"J'essaie de me souvenir de toutes les ordonnances de proc\u00e9dure pour voir si... Mais non !\" Hearing Tr.

Emphasis a dded.\n\n204.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Tribunal seriously breached a fundamental rule of procedure \"as its decision to admit and accept Algeria's new and untimely objections violated OTMTI's right to be heard\".274 As noted above, OTMTI expressed the view several times in the arbitration proceeding that the \"extinguishment of rights\" and abuse of rights objections were untimely and therefore should have been rejected (also) on that ground. It cannot be said that it waived its right to seek the partial annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nMemorial, para. 200.\n\n*(b) Alleged Untimeliness of Algeria's admissibility objections*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nPursuant to Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder \u2013 unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.\n\n206.\n\nReviewing the procedural history of the arbitration, it appears that the issues of parallel proceedings, the preclusion of claims and abuse of rights have been mentioned from the very beginning of the arbitration. They were addressed and discussed at different stages of the proceeding:\n\na) At the First Session, Algeria pointed to the parallel proceedings initiated by OTH.275\n\nb) In its Bifurcation Request, Algeria announced it would raise an admissibility objection based on the remote indirect investment of OTMTI.276\n\nc) During the Hearing on Bifurcation, Algeria mentioned a possible abuse of procedure277 which was expressly acknowledged by the Tribunal278 and OTMTI.279\n\nd) In its Memorial on Preliminary Objections, Algeria argued that OTMTI's claims are inadmissible as OTMTI lacked standing following the sale of its participation in OTH to VimpelCom and a legal interest following the settlement agreement.280 OTMTI addressed this objection in its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder.281\n\nFirst Session in the arbitration Tr. (May 16, 2013) [E] 36:11, 38:3.\n\nRespondent's Bifurcation Request dated January 24, 2014, p. 15.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Tr. (March 26, 2014) [E] 12:6, 15:10, 18:21-22, 19:14, 55:18-21.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Tr. (March 26, 2014) [E] 50:18-20.\n\nBifurcation Hearing Tr. (March 26, 2014) [E] 59:1-3, 62:7.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 286 and 288.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, paras. 113-115; Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, paras. 274-299.\n\n207.\n\nAlthough the above-mentioned issues have been pending throughout the arbitration, they have been discussed in relation to different points in time, i.e. whether the sale of Weather Investments to VimpelCom and/or the settlement agreement (but not OTH's filing of a notice of dispute and its exercise of the right to start arbitration against Algeria) would have preclusive effects. The preclusive effect of OTH's Notice of Dispute and any associated abuse of rights have indeed been first raised in Algeria's Closing Statement at the Hearing.282\n\nHrg. Tr., Day 5 (May 30, 2015) [E] 143:16-21, 153:10-25, 154:1-4, 162:1-15, 163:17-22, 168:14-15.\n\n208.\n\nHowever, the Committee does not consider that these were \"new\" preliminary objections in a technical sense as the admissibility of OTMTI's claims had been contested from the very outset of the proceeding. Whereas the factual circumstances as well as the specific legal theories relied upon evolved throughout the proceeding, the broad legal nature of the objections remained unchanged. Against this background, Algeria's argument that the objections were further developed and refined in the course of the proceeding283 appears to be correct.284 Nevertheless, Algeria's reliance on different factual circumstances in its Closing Statement raises the question whether the Claimant had the opportunity to defend itself (see below).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 240.\n\nOTMTI's Counsel, in her first reaction to the Respondent's closing statement, referred to \"a couple of new arguments [heard] this morning\", not to \"new objections\". See para. 201 above and fn. 264.\n\n*(c) OTMTI's rights to be heard and to equal treatment*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nOTMTI submits that its rights to be heard and to receive equal treatment were violated as a result of four alleged failures by the Tribunal:\n\n(i) OTMTI was unable to adequately address Algeria's new arguments in its Post-Hearing Briefs due to \"the materially abbreviated manner and timeframe permitted by post-Hearing submissions\";285\n\n(ii) OTMTI was unable to adduce new factual evidence, expert or witness testimony and severely limited in its ability to submit new legal authorities;\n\n(iii) OTMTI did not have an opportunity to comment on two of the legal authorities eventually relied upon by the Tribunal in its Award; and\n\n(iv) The Tribunal gave OTMTI no indication as to the significance it would ultimately attach to Algeria's new admissibility arguments.\n\nMemorial, para. 203.\n\n210.\n\nThe Committee shall address these four allegations in turn.\n\n*(i) OTMTI's alleged inability to adequately address Algeria's new arguments in the Post-Hearing Briefs*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nOTMTI argues that the modalities of the Post-Hearing Briefs (such as the page and time limits) had been agreed upon before Algeria revealed its new arguments in its Closing Statement.286\n\nMemorial, para. 203.\n\n212.\n\nYet the Parties agreed on a four-month deadline and a limit of 100 pages for the first Post-Hearing Brief. The Reply Post-Hearing Briefs were due another six weeks later and limited to 50 pages (later raised to 55 pages).287\n\nProcedural Order No. 10 of June 4, 2015, Sections IV.5 and IV. 6. The Order was issued five days after the closure of the Hearing on jurisdiction and a dmissibility.\n\n213.\n\nThe Committee is not convinced that these directions impaired OTMTI's ability to defend itself against Algeria's new arguments raised in the Closing Statement. During her own Closing Statement, Counsel for the Claimant observed that \"it can't really be a very serious contention\".288 And she added \"[s]o we reject it as clearly wrong\", noting that \"this is really our preliminary or initial look at some of the issues that have been raised, certainly, and we will rely for a fuller explication on our post-hearing submissions\".289 This shows that OTMTI was well aware of the Respondent's new arguments regarding the preclusive effect of OTH's Notice of Dispute and OTMTI's abuse of rights. Nevertheless, OTMTI commented only briefly on Algeria's new arguments in its further submissions, dedicating 4 pages out of its 94 in its first Post-Hearing Brief290 and 4 pages out of 59 in its Reply Post-Hearing Brief to these objections,291 considering them \"baseless in fact and in law\", or \"meritless\".292 Nothing prevented the Claimant from devoting more attention to these arguments. It could have done so with some additional six pages without any need to request the Tribunal to expand the page limit for the Post-Hearing Brief.\n\nHrg. Tr., Day 5 (May 30, 2015) [E] 197:7-16.\n\nHrg. Tr., Day 5 (May 30, 2015) [E] 171:7-10. Emphasis added.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief in the arbitration, pp. 80-84.\n\nClaimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief in the arbitration, pp. 46-50. By email of October 20, 2015 the Tribunal informed the Parties that they were allowed five additional pages in their Reply Post-Hearing Briefs to a ddress the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* received from the Kingdom of Belgium. It is unclear why OTMTI nevertheless submitted 59 pages instead of 55 pages (Algeria's Reply Post-Hearing Brief consisted of 55 pages).\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief in the arbitration, p. 81, paras. 169 and 178. See also Claimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief in the arbitration, p. 47, para. 91 and p. 48, para. 94.\n\n214.\n\nMoreover, OTMTI did not seek leave from the Tribunal to raise the page limit to address Algeria's new arguments (despite the fact that the page limit regarding the Reply Post-Hearing Briefs was raised by the Tribunal due to the BIT's *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* meanwhile received from the Kingdom of Belgium).\n\n*(ii) OTMTI's alleged inability to adduce new evidence*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nOTMTI argues that it \"did not have the opportunity to adduce any witness or expert testimony in response to Algeria's untimely objections\" and to \"submit factual evidence of any kind or legal authorities, other than publicly-available awards and decisions\" *.*293\n\nMemorial, para. 203.\n\n216.\n\nThe Committee notes that Procedural Order No. 10 granted the Parties the opportunity to submit two rounds of further legal authorities prior to the Post-Hearing Briefs.294*Prima facie,* this did not seem to be limited to any specific issues. As part of this process, the Claimant submitted the new legal authorities CLA-270 up to CLA-299. In addition to that, the Parties were allowed to submit further additional international decisions and awards as new legal authorities with the first Post-Hearing Brief to the extent that they addressed issues related to questions raised by the Tribunal.295\n\nProcedural Order No. 10 of June 4, 2015, Section III.\n\nProcedural Order No. 10 of June 4, 2015, Section IV.8.\n\n217.\n\nIn its response to Algeria's new arguments on the preclusive effect of OTH's Notice of Dispute and OTMTI's abuse of rights, the Claimant, however, did not rely on any new legal authorities. Only in its Reply Post-Hearing Brief did the Claimant submit new excerpts from Mr. Wehland's monograph.296\n\nClaimant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief in the arbitration, para. 96. H. Wehland, *The Coordination of Multiple Proceedings in Investment Treaty Arbitration*, Oxford University Press 2013, (CLA-226 (Amended)).\n\n218.\n\nWhile it is true that the Parties could only submit further additional international decisions and awards as new legal authorities with the first Post-Hearing Brief insofar as they related to the specific questions raised by the Tribunal,297 it has not been shown whether this actually hindered the Claimant in its defence:\n\nProcedural Order No. 10 of June 4, 2015, Section IV.8.\n\n219.\n\n*First,* Algeria's new arguments were spelt out in sufficient detail by Algeria's Counsel in his Closing Statement so the Claimant did not have to wait for Algeria's first Post-Hearing Brief to understand the nature and scope of the new arguments.\n\n220.\n\n*Second,* the Tribunal's limitations on the submission of new legal authorities with the Post-Hearing Briefs did not prevent the Claimant from submitting new excerpts from Mr. Wehland's monograph. Arguably, if it had intended to submit further legal authorities, it could and would have done so.\n\n221.\n\nAfter Algeria's objection to the submission of additional excerpts from Mr. Wehland's monograph, the Claimant argued in its letter to the Tribunal that:\n\n[I]f the Tribunal is to consider Respondent's new jurisdictional objection rather than reject it as untimely under the ICSID Arbitration Rules, it would be extremely prejudicial to Claimant to exclude from the record portions of a legal authority that already was in the record, as this would deny Claimant the right to be heard and would result in a fundamentally unfair proceeding and unequal treatment of the Parties. Likewise, it would be unjustified and prejudicial to Claimant to permit Respondent at this late stage to seek to introduce new legal authorities to support a jurisdictional objection that Respondent failed to raise until its Closing Argument and did not elaborate until its Post-Hearing Brief *.*298\n\nOTMTI's Letter to the Tribunal dated November 28, 2015, p. 2. The Tribunal rejected the Respondent's objection. See Award, para. 139.\n\n222.\n\nWhile the Claimant asserted that the exclusion of Mr. Wehland's monograph would violate its right to be heard, it did not state that it was in any other way hindered in its defence against Algeria's new arguments. To the contrary, it argued that the submission of new legal authorities by Algeria at this late stage of the proceeding would be \"unjustified and prejudicial\" *.* It appears that the Claimant did not take issue with the post-hearing procedure prior to the Award.\n\n223.\n\n*Finally*, as the *ad hoc* Committee in *Churchill Mining* v. *Indonesia* has stated, a party cannot object belatedly after having submitted some evidence on the ground that it now wishes it would have submitted more evidence.299\n\n*Churchill Mining Plc and Planet Mining Pty Ltd* v. *Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and ARB/12/40), Decision on Annulment, March 18, 2019, para. 186. Footnote omitted. (\"The Applicants further contend that the Parties did not file evidence, which they contend was critical, on the due diligence practice of investors in the Indonesian mining sector in 2006-2010. They admit that they nonetheless did present arguments on due diligence, but allege that these were made for different purposes than addressing the *Minnotte* factors, including in support of their claim for estoppel based on the State's alleged recognition of the validity of the disputed licenses. However, the Applicants cannot object belatedly to the Tribunal's evaluation of the evidence they presented on the basis that they now wish they might have submitted more. The fact that Churchill and Planet did submit evidence and arguments on due care reflects the fact that they evidently had the opportunity to do so\") *.*\n\n*(iii) Claimant's inability to comment on some of the legal authorities relied upon by the Tribunal*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal cited two legal authorities that were not on the record: First, it quoted a book chapter by Professor Kolb stating that the prohibition of abuse of rights is a \"general principle applicable in international law as well as in municipal law\".300 Second, it cited Sir Hersch Lauterpacht's statement that \"there is no legal right, however well established, which could not, in some circumstances, be refused recognition on the ground that it has been abused\" *.*301\n\nAward, fn. 833, citing R. Kolb, *Part Three Statute of the International Court of Justice, Ch.II Competence of the Court, General Principles of Procedural Law*, in: Zimmermann et al. (eds), *The Statute of the International Court of Justice: A Commentary* (Oxford University Press, 2nd ed. 2012), p. 904.\n\nAward, fn. 834, citing H. Lauterpacht, *The Development of International Law by the International Court* (1958), p. 164.\n\n225.\n\nAs is apparent, the two quotations from legal authorities that were not on the record only serve to establish and define the general doctrine of abuse of rights under international law. This, however, was undisputed between the Parties during the arbitration. In its two Post-Hearing Briefs in the arbitration, the Claimant had merely argued that the present scenario does not constitute an abuse of rights without contesting the existence of the doctrine under international law.302\n\nSee Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief in the arbitration, para. 178 (\"In these circumstances, there is no basis to argue, as Respondent does, that Claimant's exercise of its right under the BIT to initiate arbitration proceedings a gainst Respondent constitutes an abuse of rights\".); Cla imant's Reply Post-Hearing Brief in the arbitration, para. 94 (\"In these circumstances, there is no basis for Respondent to argue that Claimant's exercise of its right under the BIT to initiate arbitration proceedings against Respondent constitutes an abuse of process\".).\n\n226.\n\nIn the Committee's view, the Tribunal was thus under no obligation to invite the Parties to comment on these legal authorities that did not concern a legal issue in dispute between them.\n\n*(iv) No indication by the Tribunal as to the significance of Algeria's new arguments*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Applicant argues that:\n\n[O]n several occasions at the end of the proceeding, the Tribunal expressed specific interest in other issues that it was weighing, and provided additional opportunities for the Parties to address them\" and that \"[t]he significant further opportunities to be heard that the Tribunal offered with respect to objections that it later dismissed underscore the inadequacy of the procedure with respect to the new and untimely objections on the basis of which the Tribunal dismissed OTMTI's claims.303\n\nReply, para. 192.\n\n228.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Tribunal identified the effects of the sale of OTH and the settlement agreement on OTMTI's claims in the arbitration and how they should be analyzed by the Tribunal, whether as a question of admissibility, standing or quantum, as the issues on which the Parties may focus a little bit more in the Post-Hearing Briefs.304 While the Tribunal did not single out OTH's Notice of Dispute as a particular point of interest, the Tribunal's remarks were made before Algeria's Closing Statement.\n\nHearing Tr. Day 4 (May 29, 2015) [E] 197:22-199:18.\n\n229.\n\nIn its letter of February 12, 2016 (almost nine months after the Hearing), the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the requirement of *si\u00e8ge social* in the *Tenaris* v. *Venezuela* Award, issued two weeks earlier on January 29, 2016 and on the meaning of Article 1(1)(b) of the Dutch and Arabic versions of the BIT. It did, however, not invite the Parties to further comment on the preclusive effect of OTH's Notice of Dispute.\n\n230.\n\nAs the deliberations of a tribunal might advance305 and take an unexpected turn even at a late stage, a tribunal cannot be expected to provide a comprehensive list of key issues when it invites the parties to comment on certain aspects at the hearing.\n\nThe Tribunal expressly stated in its letter that it was \"making progress\".\n\n231.\n\nMoreover, as the Applicant admits,306 there is no procedural rule requiring a tribunal to signal a likely basis for its decision or outcome to the parties. Neither does the Committee consider that a tribunal is required to seek additional comments of the parties on a relevant issue that one party has only briefly touched upon in its submissions as long as the tribunal considers itself sufficiently informed by the parties' submissions. The situation might be different if a party is completely unaware of, and therefore fails to address, one of its opponent's key arguments (which is clearly not the case here as OTMTI made submissions on the two admissibility issues).\n\nReply, para. 173.\n\n232.\n\nAgainst this background, the Committee cannot find a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in this regard. Although the Tribunal's admissibility decision might have come as a surprise to OTMTI, both Parties had briefed the Tribunal on these issues in two written submissions. Furthermore, OTMTI's legal expert, Professor Dolzer, was extensively examined on the issue of abuse of rights during the Hearing.307\n\nSee e.g. Hearing Tr. Day 4 (May 29, 2015) [E] pp. 117-118.\n\n**2. THE OTH NOTICE OF DISPUTE AND THE CLAIMANT'S RIGHT TO BRING THIS ARBITRATION**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Applicant submits that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons in holding that the Claimant's right to arbitrate under the BIT had been \"extinguished\" by OTH's filing of a notice of dispute, thus rendering Claimant's claims inadmissible.\n\n*(a) The Tribunal's Application of the Law*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in holding that the Claimant's right to act under the BIT had been \"extinguished\" by OTH's filing of a notice of dispute against the Respondent under the Egypt-Algeria BIT.308 In inventing a \"putative rule of law\" depriving the Claimant of standing and in finding the claims inadmissible, the Tribunal relied on no legal authorities and found no support in the language of the ICSID Convention or the BIT.309 The Applicant further contends that, neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT contains a rule of forfeiture, waiver, or other legal limitations preventing so-called \"parallel proceedings\".310 The Applicant submits that the Tribunal invented new law based upon on its own \"purported policy 'views'\" when it refused to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it.311\n\nApplication, paras. 38-40; Memorial, para. 80.\n\nMemorial, paras. 84-85, 87; Reply, paras. 75-77.\n\nMemorial, paras. 88-97.\n\nMemorial, para. 98; A. PHB1, para. 37.\n\n235.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, four points should also be considered in the present case when examining the Tribunal's non-application of the proper law: (1) the Tribunal did not identify \"principles of international law\" as the law applicable to the Respondent's admissibility objections, nor was there any agreement between the Parties that \"principles of international law\" applied to those objections;312 (2) the specific terms of the Award provide no basis to ground the Tribunal's putative rule in the notion of \"*droit d'agir*\" or \"*int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*\";313 (3) even if it relied on this notion, the Tribunal failed to establish that such a \"notion\" is a principle of international law, or that it applies to issues of legal standing or *ius standi* in an ICSID arbitration under the BIT;314 and (4) the fact that the Applicant's legal experts understand why the Tribunal found the Claimant's claims inadmissible as a result of OTH's Notice of Dispute does not mean that the Tribunal identified or applied the proper law under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention or Article 9(4) of the BIT.315\n\nReply, para. 85; A. PHB1, para. 41.\n\nReply, paras. 86-90; A. PHB1, para. 42.\n\nReply, paras. 91-93.\n\nReply, para. 94.\n\n236.\n\nThe Applicant maintains that, while the *ad hoc* Committee cannot reopen debates on questions of fact, it can review the factual and legal premises underlying the Tribunal's Award.316 In the Applicant's view, the Tribunal invented and imposed new \"law\" based upon nothing more than its own policy views and refused to exercise the jurisdiction validly conferred upon it under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, thus manifestly exceeding its powers.317\n\nReply, paras. 95-97.\n\nReply, para. 95; A. PHB1, para. 37.\n\n*(b) The Tribunal's Reasons*\n----------------------------\n\n237.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal failed to state reasons in holding that OTH's Notice of Dispute under the Egypt-Algeria BIT rendered the Claimant's claims inadmissible, as this part of the Award relies on insufficient, contradictory, and internally inconsistent reasons.318 According to the purported rule of law, announced by the Tribunal, \"[i]f the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration, the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral proceedings may become inadmissible depending on the circumstances\".319 Yet, it is impossible to discern from the Tribunal's Award the rule \"actually applied\" because no claim of any entity in the Claimant's group has been repaired in November 2010.320 Moreover, the Tribunal's reasoning that the inadmissibility rule depends upon claims being \"fully repaired\" in a prior arbitration, while at the same time finding that the economics of the OTH Arbitration settlement was \"irrelevant\", is contradictory and internally inconsistent.321\n\nApplication, para. 54; Memorial, para. 82; A. PHB1, para. 44.\n\nAward, para. 495.\n\nMemorial, para. 100. Emphasis omitted.\n\nMemorial, paras. 101-103; A. PHB1, para. 48.\n\n238.\n\nIn addition, the Applicant submits that the Tribunal's purported statement of reasons on the consequence of OTH's Notice of Dispute further requires partial annulment. The Tribunal failed to offer any legal analysis of how one entity's filing of a notice of dispute could \"extinguish\" independent treaty claims held by a separate entity.322 The Applicant considers the Tribunal's explanations that the Claimant first caused one subsidiary to bring claims against Algeria and then it caused a different subsidiary in the chain to threaten to bring a different arbitration to the same dispute as contradictory and inconsistent.323 Finally, the Tribunal's ruling on the Notice of Dispute does not account for the Claimant's highly relevant arguments to its case.324\n\nMemorial, para. 104; A. PHB1, para. 46.\n\nMemorial, para. 107.\n\nMemorial, paras. 108-109; A. PHB1, paras. 44 and 50.\n\n239.\n\nOn OTH's Notice of Dispute, the Applicant also makes the following observations: first, the specific terms of the Award provide no basis to import the \"notion\" of \"*droit d'agir*\" or \"*int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*\" into the Tribunal's reasoning;325 second, a tribunal cannot be deemed to have considered the parties' arguments by simply summarizing them in the award and in this case the Tribunal's decision ignored the Claimant's legal argument;326 and, third, the Tribunal did not ground its putative rule on the mere assertion of a claim for relief, but rather on the harm incurred being \"fully repaired\", which the Tribunal did not determine.327\n\nReply, para. 104.\n\nReply, para. 112; A. PHB1, para. 51.\n\nReply, paras. 117-122.\n\n240.\n\nIn this context, according to the Applicant, the findings of the Tribunal on the OTH's Notice of Dispute should be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) and Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal ruled within the limits of its powers and stated its reasons for finding the Claimant's claims inadmissible on the basis of its absence of a right to act (\"*d\u00e9faut de droit d'agir*\") and thus this part of the Award should not be annulled.\n\n*(a) The Tribunal's Application of the Law*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Tribunal applied the applicable law in declaring the Claimant's claims inadmissible.328 In accordance with Article 9(4) of the BIT, the Tribunal correctly found that international law is applicable to the question of the admissibility of the claims in the arbitration proceeding.329 The Tribunal then upheld the objection to the admissibility based on the Claimant's absence of a right to act (\"*d\u00e9faut de droit d'agir*\") as a result of OTH's prior exercise of its right to arbitrate.330\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 373.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 374-383; Rejoinder, para. 437.\n\nRejoinder, para. 442.\n\n243.\n\nThe Respondent makes several arguments in this respect. First, the Tribunal adopted the Respondent's reasoning that the Claimant lost its interest to act (\"*perte d'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*\"). The Tribunal followed the same factual premises, noting the vertically integrated corporate chain of companies chaired by Mr. Sawiris and the notices of dispute signed by him concerning the same measures and defining the dispute by reference to the previous notice(s).331 The Tribunal then considered that by sending the Notice of Dispute in the name and on behalf of OTH, Mr. Sawiris had made the choice to crystallize \"the one and the same\" dispute at the level of OTH.332 In addition, the Tribunal noted that the existence of this claim in OTH's patrimony meant other companies in the corporate chain were \"satisfied\" (\"*remplies de leurs droits*\"), except if they suffered an independent loss.333 After a detailed analysis of heads of damage invoked by the Claimant, the Tribunal held that all alleged heads of damage were in fact \"caused to \u2026 OTH\" or were, for other reasons, inadmissible.334\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 390-391.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 393-394, citing Award, paras. 414, 496-497; Rejoinder, para. 446.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 396.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 397, citing Award, paras. 499-518.\n\n244.\n\nSecond, the Respondent notes that a comparison of the terms used by the Tribunal in the Award to summarize the objections based on the Claimant's loss of its interest to act (\"*perte d'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*\") (Award, paras. 411-416) with those used by the Tribunal in its analysis (Award, paras. 495-498) confirms, if need be, that the Tribunal has accepted the Respondent's objection.335 Moreover, the Applicant cannot seriously argue the Tribunal's reasoning is \"[not] grounded in any way\" on the notion of \"*droit d'agir*\" or \"*int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*\". For one, the Applicant admits that, in declaring the Claimant's claims inadmissible, the Tribunal upheld the Respondent's objections based on this notion.336 The Applicant also used, both during the arbitration proceeding and in this annulment proceeding, the term \"*standing*\" to refer to its alleged interest to act.337\n\nRejoinder, para. 447.\n\nRejoinder, para. 449.\n\nRejoinder, para. 451.\n\n245.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent takes issue with the new arguments raised by the Applicant in its Reply, criticizing the Tribunal for allegedly failing to establish the existence and scope of the notion of \"*droit d'agir*\" and \"*int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*\".338 It notes that the Claimant never contested during the arbitration proceeding that a claimant must prove it has an interest to act.339 The Tribunal also established the scope of the rule which it subsequently applied: if a claimant cannot actually claim any material loss, the conditions for the exercise of its right to act are not met.340 The Applicant's further contention that the Tribunal's application of this rule to circumstances in which it had never been applied before warrants a partial annulment of the Award is similarly to no avail, as *ad hoc* committees are not entitled to scrutinize tribunals' interpretation of the applicable law or ascertainment of the facts.341\n\nRejoinder, para. 455.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 456-459.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 461-465.\n\nRejoinder, para. 467.\n\n*(b) The Tribunal's Reasons*\n----------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal fully justified its decision that the Claimant lost standing to bring the arbitration.342 The Parties perfectly understand the Tribunal's reasoning, which the Applicant itself unwraps.343 The Tribunal sought to determine whether the conditions for the Claimant's right to act (\"*droit d'agir*\") were met and, in particular, whether the Claimant had standing to bring these arbitration proceedings (\"*int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*\").344 Based on the specific facts of the case, the Tribunal determined that the Claimant did not have standing, and thus that its claims were inadmissible.345\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 445.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 446, citing Memorial, para. 486; R.

PHB1, para. 65.\n\nRejoinder, para. 547.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 447.\n\nRejoinder, para. 550.\n\n249.\n\nIn view of the above, the Applicant's arguments alleging the part of the Award concerning the Claimant's absence of a right to act (\"*d\u00e9faut de droit d'agir*\") should be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) and Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention are plainly incorrect and should thus be rejected.\n\n**C. Committee's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Committee first turns to the issue whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it held that \"the claims before the Tribunal in reality seek reparation for losses covered by the requests for relief raised in the OTH Arbitration or for losses that the Claimant (owned and managed by an experienced businessman like Mr. Sawiris) must or should have been factored into the sale of its investments to VimpelCom\" and, consequently, \"the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the claims are inadmissible\".354\n\nAward, para. 518.\n\n251.\n\nThe Applicant complains that the Tribunal did not identify the law it applied to the issue of admissibility of OTMTI's claims, and that its conclusion has no basis in the specific terms of the BIT or the ICSID Convention or in any applicable law.355\n\nApplication, paras. 50-51; Reply, para. 76.\n\n252.\n\nAs already noted above,356 the Tribunal explicitly determined only the law applicable to the issue of jurisdiction, noting that there was no dispute that its \"jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention and the BIT\".357 The relevant provision in the BIT on the law to be applied by the Tribunal provides as follows:\n\nThe arbitration court shall rule on the basis of the national law of the contracting party that is a party to the dispute on whose territory the investment is located, including rules concerning conflicts of laws, the provisions of the present Agreement, the terms of the specific agreement that may have been made in relation to the investment, as well as the principles of international law.358\n\nPara. 75.\n\nAward, para. 134.\n\nArticle 9(4) of the BIT (in English translation). In the authentic French text, the provision reads as follows: \"*Le tribunal arbitral statuera sur la base du droit national de la Partie contractante partie au litige sur le territoire de laquelle l'investissement est situ\u00e9, y compris les r\u00e8gles relatives aux conflits de lois, des dispositions du pr\u00e9sent Accord, des termes de l'accord particulier qui serait intervenu au sujet de l'investissement, ainsi que des principes de droit international*\".\n\n253.\n\nThe Tribunal did not expressly indicate what law it would apply to the issue of admissibility of Claimant's claims. There are no specific provisions on admissibility of claims in the BIT and in the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal was, however, authorized by Article 9(4) of the BIT to apply \"the principles of international law\".\n\n254.\n\nThe Committee notes that the concept of admissibility of claims, or that of admissibility of an application, is recognized in international law; it has been accepted and applied by international courts and tribunals as will be shown below. It is distinct from the concept of jurisdiction although sometimes the same facts and arguments are presented by a party as relevant to jurisdiction and/or admissibility.359\n\nThe Tribunal noted that \"[t]he Respondent has raised a number of objections in relation to the Claimant's (former) status as indirect investor and the parallel arbitral proceedings by OTH. The characterization of these objections in terms of jurisdiction or admissibility has somewhat changed in the course of the proceedings\". Award, para. 386.\n\n255.\n\nIt is not unusual in international litigation practice that the same preliminary objection is presented as an objection to jurisdiction and, at the same time, an objection to the admissibility of the claim. This happened, for instance, in *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* case before the International Court of Justice. In this context, the Court explained:\n\nA distinction between these two kinds of objections is well recognized in the practice of the Court. In either case, the effect of a preliminary objection to a particular claim is that, if upheld, it brings the proceedings in respect of that claim to an end; so that the Court will not go on to consider the merits of the claim. If the objection is a jurisdictional objection, then since the jurisdiction of the Court derives from the consent of the parties, this will most usually be because it has been shown that no such consent has been given by the objecting State to the settlement by the Court of the particular dispute. A preliminary objection to admissibility covers a more disparate range of possibilities.360\n\nIt then referred to its earlier pronouncement:\n\nObjections to admissibility normally take the form of an assertion that, even if the Court has jurisdiction and the facts stated by the applicant State are assumed to be correct, nonetheless there are reasons why the Court should not proceed to an examination of the merits.361\n\nThe Court then added:\n\nEssentially such an objection consists in the contention that there exists a legal reason, even when there is jurisdiction, why the Court should decline to hear the case, or more usually, a specific claim therein. Such a reason is often of such a nature that the matter should be resolved in limine litis, for example where without examination of the merits it may be seen that there has been a failure to comply with the rules as to nationality of claims; failure to exhaust local remedies; the agreement of the parties to use another method of pacific settlement; or mootness of the claim.362\n\n*Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia* v. *Serbia),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 456, para. 120.\n\n*Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran* v. *United States of America)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 177, para. 29.\n\n*Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia* v. *Serbia),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 456, para. 120.\n\n256.\n\nThe concept of admissibility thus allows, in certain circumstances, an international court or tribunal to decline to exercise jurisdiction which has been conferred upon it. Jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals, including investment tribunals, is based on consent. Even when the consent has been granted, there may be situations in which it would be inappropriate for an international court or tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction. In the absence of specific provisions on admissibility in the applicable legal instruments, international courts and tribunals have derived the rules on admissibility from general international law, in particular from its principles. For instance, the International Court of Justice found that while it had jurisdiction conferred upon it by the common agreement of France, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Italy, it could not exercise this jurisdiction to adjudicate on the claim submitted by Italy without the consent of a third State (Albania), since ruling on Italy's claim would have required the Court to determine whether that third State committed any international wrong against Italy. As the Court said:\n\nTo adjudicate upon the international responsibility of Albania without her consent would run counter to a well-established principle of international law embodied in the Court's Statute, namely, that the Court can only exercise jurisdiction over a State with its consent.363\n\nSimilarly, the Court concluded that it was not able to exercise its jurisdiction in the *East Timor* case because, as a prerequisite for considering the claims, it would have had to rule on the lawfulness of conduct of the third State (Indonesia) in the absence of that State's consent.364\n\n*Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (Italy v. France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America)*, Preliminary Question, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1954, p. 32, see also pp. 33 and 34.\n\n*East Timor (Portugal* v *. Australia)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1995, p. 105, para. 35 and p. 106, para. 38.\n\n257.\n\nAnother basis for international courts and tribunals to refrain from exercising their jurisdiction may be found in their inherent powers. They may be precluded from exercising jurisdiction when exercising it would undermine a judicial function or serve no purpose. The International Court of Justice in the *Northern Cameroons* case stated:\n\n[E]ven if the Court, when seised, finds that it has jurisdiction, the Court is not compelled in every case to exercise that jurisdiction. There are inherent limitations on the exercise of the judicial function which the Court, as a court of justice, can never ignore *.*365\n\n*Northern Cameroons (Cameroon* v *. United Kingdom)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 29. Emphasis a dded.\n\n258.\n\nThis seems to be, in the context of investment arbitration, the approach adopted by the Tribunal in *Phoenix Action Ltd.* v. *Czech Republic*. Although there is nothing explicitly stated to this effect in the ICSID Convention and the Czech Republic-Israel BIT, the Tribunal expressed the view that\n\nStates cannot be deemed to offer access to the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments not made in good faith. The protection of international investment arbitration cannot be granted if such protection would run contrary to the general principles of international law, among which the principle of good faith is of utmost importance.366\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd.* v. *Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5), Award, April 15, 2009, para. 106.\n\n259.\n\nAlgeria accepted that it agreed to protect \"genuine Belgian/Luxembourgish investors\" under the BIT. It also agreed, through a different treaty, to protect Italian investors and through yet another treaty Egyptian investors. But it also argued that it \"never agreed to be tried three times for one thing\".367\n\nHearing Tr. Day 5 (May 30, 2015) [E] 164:12-20/ [F] 66:15-16: \"*n'a jamais accept\u00e9 de se voir poursuivre trois fois pour la m\u00eame chose*\". Algeria also argued that it \"never [\u2026] agree[d] to protect three levels in one given chain of control under a vertical integration in which the organs are accountable to the top of the chain, as Mr. Nasr recognized\" (\"*n'a jamais consenti \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger trois niveaux de la m\u00eame cha\u00eene de contr\u00f4le op\u00e9r\u00e9e suivant le principe d'int\u00e9gration verticale dans laquelle les organes r\u00e9pondent au sommet de la cha\u00eene, comme l'assume compl\u00e8tement M. Nasr*\"), *ibid.*\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, examined the three notices of dispute by OTH, Weather Investments and the Claimant to Algeria to conclude that they \"concern the same measures or events\".368 This conclusion is well documented in the Award.369\n\nAward, para. 486.\n\nAward, paras. 487-490 at pp. 121-129.\n\n261.\n\nIn the view of the Committee, the Tribunal explicitly relied on the purpose of investment treaty arbitration when it formulated a rule on possible inadmissibility of claims brought before it. The relevant passage in the Award reads as follows:\n\n[T]he existence of several legal foundations for arbitration does not necessarily mean that the various entities in the shareholder chain could make use of the existing arbitration clauses to assail the same measures and to recover the same economic loss under any circumstances. Indeed, the purpose of investment treaty arbitration is to grant full reparation for the injuries that a qualifying investor may have suffered as a result of a host state's wrongful measures. If the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration, the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral proceedings may become inadmissible depending on the circumstances.370\n\nAward, para. 495.\n\n262.\n\nThe Committee sees nothing wrong in presenting the issue of admissibility of claims this way. If the harm was fully repaired in one arbitration, then there is nothing to be repaired in another arbitration. Deriving the rule on admissibility from the purpose of investment treaty arbitration was a legitimate exercise by the Tribunal of its function.\n\n263.\n\nThe Tribunal endeavored to apply this rule to the circumstances of the case. It formed the view that \"the legal protection that was available at the various levels of the corporate chain was activated [on November 2, 2010] at the OTH level\".371 That protection was activated by OTH's Notice of Dispute, which according to the Tribunal assumed \"a decisive importance\" because \"[OTMTI] and its controlling shareholder, Mr. Sawiris, caused the corporate organs of OTH to crystallize the dispute at the level of OTA's direct investor\".372 The Tribunal stated that:\n\nBy exercising its right to arbitrate against Algeria, OTH placed itself in the position of being made whole for the alleged harm. Indeed, if it succeeded on the merits, the harm caused by the litigious measures would be remedied.373\n\nAward, para. 497.\n\nAward, para. 496.\n\nAward, para. 497.\n\n264.\n\nThe Claimant criticizes the Tribunal for assigning this role to OTH's Notice of Dispute, and emphasizes that \"a notice of dispute under a treaty does not initiate arbitration proceedings, nor does it have any legal effect other than to trigger the cooling off-period under the relevant treaty\".374 It is certainly correct to state that arbitration proceedings are instituted by sending of a notice of arbitration, not by sending of a notice of dispute. However, a notice of dispute plays an important role in the settlement of investment disputes. It makes a State aware of the investor's claims. Investor protests against the measures adopted by a State (or in some situations, of a failure to take measures, for instance of protecting the investment) as being contrary to the legal obligations of a host State. When a notice of dispute is required in the BIT's article on settlement of disputes, it is a pre-requisite, a condition for instituting arbitration proceedings by sending a notice of arbitration if a dispute has not been settled by agreement.\n\nAnnulment Hearing Tr. Day 1 (May 27, 2019) [E] 76.\n\n265.\n\nWhether the Tribunal's view of the role of OTH's Notice of Dispute as \"crystalliz[ing] the dispute at the level of OTA's director investor\" is accurate and what this entails legally in the Tribunal's view is another matter. Critical to the Tribunal's finding was ultimately the question whether the harm caused by the measures complained of was remedied.\n\n266.\n\nThe Tribunal, in its analysis, was looking into the question whether the harm caused by the measures complained of was remedied. It stated that:\n\nTo the extent OTH would have restored its company value through arbitration proceedings under the BIT, all of the companies higher up in the corporate chain, including the Claimant, would have been made whole as well. Indeed, their loss depends on the diminution in value of their shares in OTH, which depends on the value of OTH (which in turn is a function of OTA's value). If the value of OTH is restored, then the shareholders of OTH suffer no loss, unless they incurred a loss of their own which is independent of the value of OTH.375\n\nAward, para. 498.\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal thus considered that the harm caused to OTH was to be remedied in the arbitration instituted by OTH. That Arbitration led to a consent award376 recording the settlement agreement reached on April 18, 2014. Therefore, the Tribunal focused its attention on reviewing the losses that OTMTI alleged to have suffered as a result of Algeria's measures to determine whether OTMTI requested relief for losses that only it suffered, irrespective of the valuation of OTH. It concluded that that was not the case. Rather, in the view of the Tribunal, the claims before it:\n\n[I]n reality [sought] reparation for losses covered by the requests for relief raised in the OTH Arbitration or for losses that the Claimant (owned and managed by an experienced businessman like Mr. Sawiris) must or should have factored into the sale of its investment to VimpelCom.377\n\nThat was the reason for the conclusion that the OTMTI's claims were inadmissible. The Tribunal did not need to postpone its examination of OTMTI's claims to the merits stage of the proceeding. It stressed in the Award that \"[i]n carrying out its analysis, the Tribunal ha[d] the benefit of the Claimant's full memorial on the merits, the three expert reports presented by the Claimant's expert on valuation and damages analysis (two of which were filed, specifically in the bifurcated phase, dealing with the Respondent's preliminary objections), the extensive discussion on these issues at the Hearing, including the cross-examination of the Claimant's expert, as well as the record of the OTH Arbitration\".378 No purpose would have been served by continuing the litigation which the Tribunal knew was \"bound to be fruitless\".379\n\n*Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E.* v. *People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, PCA Case No. 2012-20, Award on Agreed Terms, March 12, 2015.\n\nAward, para. 518.\n\nAward, para. 499.\n\nSee *Nuclear Tests (Australia* v. *France),* Judgment, I.C.J.

Reports 1963, p. 38.\n\n268.\n\nIt may be recalled that the Tribunal in *Occidental Exploration* v. *Ecuador* also adopted the approach that an issue may already be dealt with at the admissibility stage of the proceeding when it is evident that a certain claim is unfounded.380\n\nThe Tribunal stated: \"A claim of expropriation should normally be considered in the context of the merits of a case. However, it is so evident that there is no expropriation in this case that the Tribunal will deal with this claim as a question of a dmissibility\". *Occidental Exploration and Protection Company* v. *Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No UN 3467, Final Award, July 1, 2004, para. 80.\n\n269.\n\nIn view of the above, the Committee cannot uphold the request that it annul this part of the Award on the inadmissibility of OTMTI's claims for manifest excess of the Tribunal's powers.\n\n270.\n\nThe Committee now briefly turns to the allegation that the Tribunal failed to state reasons when it found that the claims were inadmissible in view of the above-stated considerations.\n\n271.\n\nThe Committee recalls that pursuant to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention a tribunal has an obligation to state reasons upon which the award is based. The statement of reasons is required in order to allow parties to understand how a tribunal has come to its conclusions. As the *ad hoc* Committee in *Tulip* v. *Turkey* stated \"[a]s long as an *ad hoc* Committee can follow the reasons, it is irrelevant what it thinks of their quality\".381 The *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi* v. *Argentina (II)* adopted a relatively strict approach on this matter, holding that \"the issue before [it] is not to assess the accuracy or quality of the reasons given by the Tribunal but rather to review whether the reasons enable the reader to understand why the Tribunal reached the conclusions that were determinative for its decision(s)\"382.\n\n*Tulip* v. *Turkey*, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, para. 101.\n\n*Vivendi* v. *Argentina (II)*, Decision on Annulment, May 5, 2017, para. 154.\n\n272.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal, before it reached its conclusion on the inadmissibility of the Claimant's claims, set out the main elements which it considered \"relevant to the objections\".383 It then examined the three notices of dispute sent to Algeria by OTH on November 2, 2010, Weather Investments on November 8, 2010 and by the Claimant on April 16, 2012. It highlighted their main passages in a seven-page chart.384 Having compared the three notices of dispute, the Tribunal formed the view that \"the three companies complain[ed] of the same measures taken by Algeria\" and that \"while the parties to the dispute and the legal bases for the claims (the BITs) are different, the dispute being notified in the three notices is effectively one and the same\".385 The Tribunal provided additional reasons why it considered the dispute notified in the three notices \"to be one and the same\".386 The Tribunal then looked at the role of Mr. Sawiris in the three companies (parts of the vertically integrated chain of the Weather Group) in which he was the controlling shareholder.387\n\nAward, para. 485.\n\nAward, para. 487 (pp. 122-128).\n\nAward, para. 488.\n\nAward, para. 489.\n\nAward, paras. 490-494.\n\n273.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal does not refer to any legal authority or precedent, it derives the rule according to which \"[i]f the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration, the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral proceedings may become inadmissible depending on the circumstances\" from the purpose of investment treaty arbitration which, in the Tribunal's view \"is to grant full reparation for the injuries that a qualifying investor may have suffered as a result of a host State's wrongful measures\".388 The Tribunal thus took the view that whether the claims are inadmissible depends on the circumstances. To a reader of the Award, it is sufficiently clear on what factual circumstances the Tribunal bases its decision and it is not difficult to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal.389 Whether the reasons provided by the Tribunal are convincing is another matter with which the annulment proceeding is not concerned.390\n\nAward, para. 495. Emphasis added.\n\nAward, paras. 496-518.\n\nSee e.g., *Fraport* v. *The Philippines*, Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, para. 277, *Tulip* v. *Turkey*, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, paras. 99 and 104, *EDF* v. *Argentina*, Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2016, para. 328.\n\n274.\n\nThe Committee thus cannot accept the Applicant's submission that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its finding that OTH's Notice of Dispute was of decisive importance in itself and in combination with the subsequent events in rendering the claims inadmissible.391\n\nAward, para. 496.\n\n**3. THE OTH ARBITRATION SETTLEMENT AND THE INADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIMANT'S CLAIMS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n275.\n\nAssuming *arguendo* the Tribunal's findings with respect to the OTH Arbitration settlement were an independent ground for finding the Claimant's claims inadmissible under the BIT, the Applicant complains that, in any case, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons in finding that this settlement confirmed the inadmissibility of the Claimant's claims. Thus, this part of the Award should also be annulled.392\n\nApplication, paras. 45-46, 60; Memorial, paras. 171-172; Reply, paras. 151-152.\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimant was not, and could not have been, bound by the terms of the OTH Arbitration settlement or the Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) because it was not a party or a privy to them.393 Yet, \"the Tribunal failed to address and instead ignored all of [the Claimant]'s submissions and legal authorities demonstrating that a settlement agreement is binding only on the parties and privies thereto\".394 Even assuming that the economic harm and measures were the same, the Tribunal's determination was wrongly premised on the Claimant's claims under the BIT being the same as OTH's claims under the Egypt-Algeria BIT, but these claims were distinct.395 Finally, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal ignored the Claimant's numerous submissions that the SPA was a deal between two self-interested parties who conspired to share the spoils of the significant losses that the Claimant suffered as a result of the Respondent's measures.396\n\nMemorial, paras. 172-174.\n\nMemorial, para. 174.\n\nMemorial, paras. 175-182.\n\nMemorial, paras. 183-186.\n\n277.\n\nThe Applicant also submits that: (1) the Tribunal did not endeavor to apply, and did not apply, a principle of international law in determining the relevance of the settlement of the OTH Arbitration to OTMTI's claims;397 (2) the Tribunal failed in its analysis to address any of the Claimant's arguments and legal authorities regarding the legal effect of a settlement agreement on non-parties and non-privies thereto;398 and (3) the Respondent's contention that the Claimant's allegation of collusion was raised only in passing at the Hearing, and that the Claimant failed to draw any \"legal consequences\" from this allegation, are baseless.399\n\nReply, para. 154.\n\nReply, paras. 159-160.\n\nReply, paras. 161-167.\n\n278.\n\nFor the Applicant, there thus was not only a clear allegation of collusion between OTH, VimpelCom, and Algeria, but also significant evidence of such collusion, which the Tribunal entirely failed to address in its Award. This failure constitutes a further failure to state reasons requiring partial annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.400\n\nMemorial, para. 187.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that the part of the Award addressing the effect of the OTH settlement agreement is fully reasoned and the Tribunal applied the proper law.401 It argues that the Applicant's assertion that the Tribunal ignored two of its arguments in ruling on the effect of the OTH settlement agreement on the Claimant's right to act (\"*int\u00e9r\u00eat pour agir*\") is manifestly unfounded.402\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 461-469.\n\nRejoinder, para. 553.\n\n280.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal considered at length whether the sale of the investment could affect its previous conclusions regarding the absence of the right to act and the effect of the OTH settlement agreement, notably in an entire part of the Award devoted to \"[t]he relevance of the sale of the Claimant's investment\".403 While it did not expressly address the case law cited by the Claimant, the Tribunal rejected its argument and fully justified this decision, concluding that the \"Claimant's sale of its investment does not affect the Tribunal's conclusion on the inadmissibility of the Claimant's claims\".404\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 462, citing Award, paras. 527-538.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 557-558, citing Award, para. 538.\n\n281.\n\nSecond, the Applicant's contention that the Tribunal ignored an alleged \"collusion\" between the Respondent and OTH is, according to the Respondent, also manifestly unfounded.405 The Applicant complains that the Tribunal did not rule on an insinuation of conspiracy that it made on only one occasion at the Hearing, without any supporting evidence, and without drawing any legal conclusion from it.406 In any event, this insinuation was contradicted by the evidence filed in the arbitration proceeding related to the OTH settlement agreement,407 and the Tribunal expressly stated that it considered that the criticisms formulated by the Claimant in this regard were \"irrelevant\".408 Therefore, the Tribunal's decision on the OTH settlement agreement is fully reasoned.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 465.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 561-563.\n\nRejoinder, para. 561.\n\nRejoinder, para. 565.\n\n282.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal ruled within the limits of its powers in considering that the OTH settlement agreement \"confirms and reinforces\" the inadmissibility of the Claimant's claims.409 Notably, the Tribunal found that this settlement \"clearly resolved the dispute that the Claimant has brought before this Tribunal as is shown by the comparison of the notices of disputes above\"410 and \"puts an end to the dispute arising from Algeria's measures in the same manner as the award would have ended the dispute\".411 Thus, the Tribunal drew the consequences of the existence of \"one and the same\" dispute.412 The Respondent submits that the Applicant's partial annulment request under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention can therefore only be rejected.\n\nRejoinder, para. 475.\n\nAward, para. 524.\n\nAward, para. 524.\n\nRejoinder, para. 477.\n\n**C. Committee's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n283.\n\nIn the Committee's view, the Tribunal's conclusion that \"the settlement agreement entered into between the Algerian FNI, OTH and VimpelCom confirms that the Claimant's claims are inadmissible\"413, merely constitutes a confirmatory statement and is not a separate ground for the Tribunal's finding that OTMTI's claims are inadmissible. The Applicant stated that the Committee \"need not examine the Tribunal's findings with respect to the OTH settlement, which were not dispositive\".414 Yet, the Applicant also maintains that \"these findings also should be annulled for manifest excess of power and failure to state reasons\".415\n\nAward, para. 526. Em phasis added.\n\nA. PHB, para. 52, referring to Memorial, para. 270.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n284.\n\nThe Committee is not convinced that the Tribunal exceeded its powers, and certainly not manifestly, when it concluded that the settlement agreement confirmed its earlier findings that the Claimant's claims were inadmissible. When examining the relevance of the settlement agreement, the Tribunal pursued the same logic of the investment law rule which it derived from the purpose of investment treaty arbitrations. It defined that purpose as \"to grant full reparation for injuries that a qualifying investor may have suffered as a result of a host state's wrongful measures\".416 The Tribunal described the rule in the following way: \"[i]f the harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration, the claims brought by other members of the vertical chain in other arbitral proceedings may become inadmissible depending on the circumstances\".417 In the context of the settlement agreement, the rule applied by the Tribunal could be stated as follows: the claim of a (former) indirect shareholder becomes inadmissible if and when a settlement agreement concerning the same measures and the same economic harm is concluded between the direct foreign shareholder and the host State.418 According to this rule, the relevant point in time for rendering further claims based on the same economic harm inadmissible is thus the time when the settlement of a dispute is reached by way of an agreement. This is because a settlement agreement compensates for the loss incurred by an investor. Once the harm is compensated, an indirect investor higher up in the corporate chain can no longer demand payment for its loss of share value by the direct investor. Any such claim would fail at the merits stage; it may be said that absent any own loss,419 the claim of the indirect investor is manifestly unfounded and therefore inadmissible.420 Consequently, to the extent that the Tribunal relied on the settlement agreement to confirm and reinforce its prior conclusions on the inadmissibility of OTMTI's claims, it did not manifestly exceed its powers.\n\nAward, para. 495.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nSee Award, paras. 524-525.\n\nThe Tribunal stated that \"if the value of OTH is restored, then the shareholders of OTH suffer no loss, unless they incurred a loss of their own which is independent of the value of OTH\", Award, para. 498. The Tribunal then reviewed \"the losses that the Claimant alleges to have suffered as a result of Algeria's measures, with a view to examining whether the Claimant requests relief for losses that only itself suffered irrespective of the valuation of the OTH, Award, para. 499. The review is contained in paras. 499-517. However, it is not the role of an annulment Committee to scrutinize whether that review is the correct one. This depends on the evidence and according to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34 the Tribunal shall be the judge of the probative value of the evidence.\n\nSee para. 269 above and fn. 382.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal devoted eight paragraphs421 to its analysis of the settlement agreement of April 18, 2014 between the Algerian FNI (acting on behalf of Algeria), OTH and VimpelCom. The Tribunal was fully aware of Claimant's arguments that the settlement of the OTH Arbitration was irrelevant to jurisdiction and admissibility as the Tribunal summarized them rather extensively.422 Having already earlier concluded that it has jurisdiction, the Tribunal considered whether the settlement had any relevance for the issue of the admissibility of Claimant's claims. The Tribunal was not convinced that \"the settlement was made in suspicious circumstances (such as that it was forced by Algeria upon OTH or was entered into by OTH's board in collusion with Algeria\"423 contrary to what was alleged by OTMTI in the original arbitration proceeding and is still maintained by it in the present annulment proceeding. However, it is not for an annulment committee to re-evaluate the evidence and arguments of the parties in the arbitration and to substitute its own view for the one formed by an arbitration tribunal. According to Rule 34(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules \"[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence and of its probative value\".\n\nAward, paras. 519-526.\n\nAward, paras. 452-463.\n\nAward, para. 523.\n\n286.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal did not address in writing each and every argument made by the Parties, it has shown by summarizing them that it took them into account during its deliberation. In the view of the Committee, the Tribunal provided sufficient reasons for its conclusions that \"the Claimant cannot bring claims in this arbitration that OTH decided to settle\"424 and that \"the settlement agreement entered into between the Algerian FNI, OTH and VimpelCom confirms that the Claimant's claims are inadmissible\".425 In the Tribunal's view, \"the settlement clearly resolved the dispute that the Claimant has brought before this Tribunal as is shown by the comparison of the notices of disputes above\".426 For the Tribunal, \"the settlement stands in lieu of the investment treaty tribunal's award\" and thus \"puts an end to the dispute arising from Algeria's measures in the same manner as the award would have ended the dispute\".427 In the view of the Tribunal, \"[w]hat matters is that the claims arising from Algeria's measures have ceased to exist due to the settlement agreement\".428\n\nAward, para. 524.\n\nAward, para. 526.\n\nAward, para. 524. The comparison of the three notices of dispute appears in para. 487 of the Award. The Committee considers that the plural in the term \"disputes\" in para. 524 of the Award is rather an inadvertent mistake as para. 487 refers to \"three notifications of dispute\" (in singular) and for the Tribunal \"the dispute being notified in the three notices is effectively one and the same\" (Award, para. 488.).\n\nAward, para. 524.\n\nAward, para. 524.\n\n287.\n\nThis is the key reasoning of the Tribunal for its conclusion on the relevance of the settlement agreement which supports its conclusion that the claims are inadmissible. To recall, the annulment proceeding is not concerned with the correctness of the reasons and conclusions. In any case, they appear reasonable and certainly not frivolous or absurd.\n\n288.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee cannot accept the Applicant's request that this part of the Award be annulled for manifest excess of powers and for failure to state reasons by the Tribunal.\n\n**4. THE CLAIMANT'S PURSUIT OF ITS CLAIMS AS AN ABUSE OF RIGHTS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicant's Position**\n---------------------------\n\n289.\n\nThe Applicant submits the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons when it dismissed its claims on the basis of an abuse of rights.429 The Tribunal's decision to admit and accept the Respondent's untimely objections and, in so doing, to rely upon legal authority not in the record, should be annulled under Article 52(1)(e) and Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.430\n\nApplication, paras. 41-44, 57.\n\nMemorial, para. 189.\n\n*(a) The Tribunal's Application of the Law*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law by disregarding the BIT and ICSID Convention,431 assuming without demonstrating that the theory of abuse of rights is a general principle of international law,432 and supporting its views on the purpose of investment treaties with no legal authority whatsoever.433 Further disregarding the applicable law, the Tribunal failed to define abuse of rights with reference to clearly established and recognizable criteria,434 to acknowledge the high standard of proof that must be met in abuse of rights cases,435 and to follow the decisions of other tribunals finding that multiple proceedings do not give rise to an abuse of rights.436\n\nMemorial, paras. 116-120.\n\nMemorial, paras. 121-123; Reply, paras. 123 and 133.\n\nMemorial, paras. 124-130.\n\nMemorial, paras. 132-136; Reply, para. 124.\n\nMemorial, paras. 137-140.\n\nMemorial, paras. 141-150.\n\n291.\n\nMoreover, the Applicant submits that the Tribunal did not identify \"principles of international law\" as the law applicable to Algeria's admissibility objections, nor was there any agreement between the Parties to this effect;437 even if this was the case, the Tribunal nonetheless was duty bound to prove, rather than assume, that abuse of right is a general principle of international law and thus part of the applicable law that it was bound to apply;438 and that the Applicant is entitled to challenge the Tribunal's decision on abuse of right because it did challenge this theory in the underlying arbitration,439 and the Applicant can rely on new expert evidence in support of its partial annulment application since this evidence is \"specifically relevant\".440\n\nReply, paras. 131-132.\n\nReply, paras. 133-141. According to Applicant, it is not challenging the Tribunal's application of the theory of abuse of right to the facts of the case, but rather the Tribunal's failure to establish that the theory of abuse of right that it purported to apply is a principle of international law, the Tribunal's failure to identify the legal requirements for the application of the theory of abuse of right and the applicable standard, and the Tribunal's failure to consider the decisions of other courts and tribunals on these issues (*Ibid.* at para. 140).\n\nReply, para. 142.\n\nReply, para. 143.\n\n*(b) The Tribunal's Reasons*\n----------------------------\n\n292.\n\nIt is the Applicant's view that the Tribunal failed to state reasons when it dismissed its claims as an abuse of rights. For one, the Tribunal did not explain how filing multiple notices of dispute, which invite negotiations with the State and preserve the right to bring arbitration, but do not themselves commence arbitration, could ever be abusive.441 The only action attributed to the Claimant is OTH's filing a notice of dispute in November 2010.442 When OTH commenced the OTH Arbitration through a notice of arbitration dated April 12, 2012, the Claimant had already sold Weather Investments to VimpelCom for a year and had thus broken the vertical chain.443 In addition, the Tribunal failed to state reasons by failing to address the Claimant's arguments regarding the standard of proof applicable to abuse of rights objections.444\n\nMemorial, para. 156.\n\nMemorial, para. 159.\n\nMemorial, para. 159.\n\nMemorial, paras. 166-169.\n\n293.\n\nThe Applicant further advances that the Tribunal's reasoning cannot be followed from its own putative legal rule to the Tribunal's conclusion, as the Applicant did not cause multiple entities within a vertical chain of companies to bring parallel claims against the Respondent, but rather only commenced the present arbitration against the Respondent. The Applicant takes issue with four of the Respondent's arguments on this point, and replies that: (1) there is no basis in the specific terms of the Award to conclude that the Tribunal considered and implicitly rejected the Claimant's arguments regarding the legal effect of a notice of dispute;445 (2) the Tribunal's reliance on \"circumstances\" alone, without reference to legal rules of decision, is subject to annulment for both a manifest excess of powers and a failure to state reasons;446 (3) not only did the Tribunal fail to address the Claimant's arguments regarding the high standard of proof, but it also failed to explain what, if any, standard it applied in assessing the evidence before it;447 and (4) the Applicant is not contesting the soundness of the Tribunal's reasons, but rather the absence of *any* reasons on the abuse of right.448\n\nReply, para. 146.\n\nReply, paras. 147-148.\n\nReply, paras. 149.\n\nReply, para. 150. Emphasis in the original.\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondent sets forth that the Tribunal ruled within the limits of its powers and stated its reasons when it ruled on the existence of an abuse of rights by the Claimant. The Respondent submits that the Applicant's contentions to the contrary are to no avail.449\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 412-424 and 470-478.\n\n*(a) The Tribunal's Application of the Law*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal applied the applicable law and respected the limits of its powers by declaring the Claimant's claims inadmissible on the basis of the abuse of rights. First of all, the Applicant does not dispute in its submissions in these annulment proceeding that the Tribunal has endeavoured to apply the applicable law, which is in itself sufficient to conclude that it did not commit an excess of power.450 The inquiry of an excess of power is indeed limited to determining whether the tribunal has endeavoured to apply the proper law to the circumstances of the case.451 In this case, the Tribunal rejected the Claimant's claims on the basis of what it determined to be a \"principle of international law\" (\"*principe de droit international*\") under Article 9(4) of the BIT.452 By stating that the Tribunal \"assumed, without demonstrating, that the theory of abuse of right is a general principle of international law applicable in an ICSID arbitration under the BIT\",453 the Applicant admits that the Tribunal applied what it determined to be a principle of international law while criticizing it for not having sufficiently supported its decision on this point.454\n\nRejoinder, para. 485.\n\nRejoinder, para. 486.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 414.\n\nReply, para. 123.\n\nRejoinder, para. 488.\n\n296.\n\nMoreover, the Applicant raises new arguments at the annulment stage, which is not permitted. The Claimant's position on abuse of rights in the underlying arbitration\u2014which can be identified from the examination of its expert Professor Dolzer, its Closing Statement at the Hearing, and its post-hearing briefs\u2014was, among others, that this principle applied primarily to the treaty-shopping situation found in *Phoenix Action*, but there was no abuse in the present case of an indirect shareholder asserting claims before the second forum.455 However, the Applicant now contests the existence of the abuse of rights principle and, alternatively, that the \"clearly established and recognizable criteria\" and \"legal requirements\" of abuse of rights have been examined by the Tribunal in this case.456 Since there was an agreement between the Parties that the abuse of rights principle forms part of international law, the Tribunal cannot be criticized for applying this principle to the present circumstances.457\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 416; Rejoinder, para. 492.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 417.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 419.\n\n297.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the Applicant aims to question the soundness of the Tribunal's reasoning, which cannot constitute an excess of power. The criticisms addressed by the Applicant seek to challenge the Tribunal's assessment of the content of the applicable law and the manner in which the Tribunal applied the abuse of rights principle to the circumstances of the case.458 For instance, the Applicant's contention, according to which \"a consistent line of arbitral decisions finding that multiple proceedings do not give rise to an abuse of rights\", seeks to criticize the Tribunal's appraisal of the scope of the abuse of rights principle.459 However, as noted by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Venezuela Holdings,* while refusing to second-guess the tribunal's decision on abuse of rights, \"it seems to the Committee beyond doubt that it has no legitimate power to control the Tribunal's specific findings on either of the two elements in its jurisdictional findings, i.e. either the legal theory which the Tribunal applied in order to distinguish between legitimate corporate planning and abuse of right, or the application of that theory to the particular circumstances of the case\".460\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 420; Rejoinder, para. 496.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 420.

Emphasis omitted.\n\n298.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Respondent concludes that the Applicant's arguments based on Article 52(1)(b) that the Tribunal allegedly committed a manifest excess of power must be rejected.461\n\nRejoinder, para. 501.\n\n*(b) The Tribunal's Reasons*\n----------------------------\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Tribunal fully justified its decision to find an abuse of rights in this case. For one, both the legal basis and the factual premises of the Tribunal's reasoning can be understood from the language used in the Award.462 The Tribunal stated its reasons as follows: first, it established the legal basis of the general principle of abuse of rights (which the Applicant recognizes in its briefs exists in international law);463 second, the Tribunal identified the special circumstances that may constitute an abuse of rights, noting it may be applied beyond the context of opportunistic investment restructuring and extend to situations where \"an investor who controls several entities in a vertical chain of companies [\u2026] seeks to impugn the same host state measures and claims for the same harm at various levels of the chain in reliance on several investment treaties concluded by the host state\";464 third, the Tribunal applied the abuse of rights principle to the facts at hand in finding, among others, that the Claimant's actions were inconsistent with the objective of the investment treaty system (which has already been achieved when the investment protection was activated at OTH level).465\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 475-477; R.

PHB1, para. 76.\n\nRejoinder, para. 575.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 577-578.\n\nRejoinder, para. 579.\n\n301.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal fully stated its reasons for finding an abuse of rights in this case, and the Applicant's application on the basis of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention can only be dismissed.470\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 478; Rejoinder, para. 580.\n\n**C. Committee's Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n302.\n\nAfter briefly summarizing the arguments of the Parties471 on the alleged abuse of rights by Mr. Sawiris' conduct who \"sought to maximize his chances of success by introducing several arbitrations against the Respondent at different levels of the chain of companies\",472 the Tribunal devoted seven paragraphs to the consideration of the question whether the initiation of the proceedings by OTMTI also constituted an abuse of rights.473\n\nAward, paras. 417-419 (Respondent) and 449-450 (Claimant).\n\nAward, para. 417.\n\nAward, paras. 539-545.\n\n303.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Tribunal referred to the application of the \"doctrine\" of abuse of rights in investment jurisprudence mainly in situations where an investment was restructured to attract BIT protection at a time when a dispute with the host State had arisen or was foreseeable.474 Relying on two academic writings,475 the Tribunal noted, however, that the prohibition of abuse of rights as a general principle applicable in international law as well as in municipal law \"may equally apply in context other than [an opportunistic restructuring of investment]\".476\n\nAward, para. 540. In footnote 832 three decisions (all part of the record) of arbitral tribunals are referred to: *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holdings, Ltd., Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Holdings, Inc., Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., and Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27) *(\"Mobil* v. *Venezuela*\"), Decision on Jurisdiction, June 10, 2010, paras. 169ff; *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A.* v. *Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/17), Award, January 9, 2015, paras. 180ff (with further references to cases) and *Lao Holdings N.V.* v. *Lao People's Democratic Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6), Decision on Jurisdiction, February 21, 2014.\n\nR.

Em phasis added.\n\n304.\n\nThe Applicant criticizes that this statement by the Tribunal as just an assertion without reference to any authority.477 The Committee notes, however, that although there is no case-law referred to immediately after this statement, the Tribunal nevertheless, when referring to the monograph by Sir Hersch Lauterpacht \"The Development of International Law by the International Court\" in support of its view, adds that the same quote is cited by the Tribunal in *Mobil* v. *Venezuela.*478 As noted above, that Decision was one of the decisions on which the Tribunal relied to confirm that \"the doctrine [of abuse of rights] has found application in investment jurisprudence mainly in situations where an investment was [opportunistically] restructured\".479\n\nMemorial, para. 125.\n\nAward, fn. 834.\n\nAward, para. 540. Em phasis added.\n\n305.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Mobil* v. *Venezuela* considered the law applicable to abuse of right in much more detail.480 It observed that \"in all systems of law, whether domestic or international, there are concepts framed in order to avoid misuse of the law. Reference may be made in this respect to \"good faith\"(\"*bonne foi*\"), \"*detournement de pouvoir*\" (misuse of power) or \"*abus de droit*\" (abuse of right)\".481 It referred to two judgments of the Permanent Court of International Justice in support of the existence of the concept of abuse of right in international law.482 It also recalled that \"ICSID tribunals had a number of occasions to consider whether or not the conduct of an investor does constitute 'an abuse of the convention purposes', 'an abuse of legal personality', an 'abuse of corporate form' or an 'abuse of the system of international investment protection'\".483 It concluded that \"[u]nder general international law as well as under ICSID case law, abuse of right is to be determined in each case, taking into account all circumstances of the case\".\n\n*Mobil* v. *Venezuela*, Decision on Jurisdiction, June 10, 2010, paras. 169-185.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*. at paras. 173-174, referring to *Polish Upper Silesia*, P.C.I.J., Series A, Judgment No. 7, p. 30 and *Free Zones of Upper Savoy and District of Gex*, P.C.I.J., Series A/B No. 46, Judgment of June 7, 1932, [p. 167].\n\n*Ibid*., para. 176. Footnotes omitted.\n\n306.\n\nThe existence of the concepts of abuse of process and abuse of rights in international law was recently confirmed by the International Court of Justice in *Immunities and Criminal Proceedings* case.484 The Court stated that \"[i]n the case law of the Court and its predecessor, a distinction has been drawn between abuse of rights and abuse of process. Although the basic concepts of an abuse may be the same, the consequences of an abuse of right or an abuse of process may be different\".485 It expressed the view that \"[a]n abuse of process goes to the procedure before a court or tribunal and can be considered at the preliminary phase of these proceedings\".486 It also added that \"[i]t is only in exceptional circumstances that the Court should reject a claim based on a valid title of jurisdiction on the ground of abuse of process\".487 Thus, circumstances of the case assume the critical importance and it is for a court or tribunal to consider them. In relation to abuse of rights, the Court noted that \"abuse of rights cannot be invoked as a ground of inadmissibility when the establishment of the right in question is properly a matter for the merits\".488\n\n*Immunities, and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea* v. *France)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2018, p. 292.\n\n*Ibid*. at p. 335, para. 146.\n\n*Ibid*. at p. 336, para. 150.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid.* at p. 337, para. 151.\n\n307.\n\nIt is to be observed that the Tribunal gave its consideration to the issue of the use of the right granted to the investor under Article 9 of the BIT by the Claimant, in particular Mr. Sawiris who controlled the Claimant.489 Article 9 of the BIT concerns the settlement of investment disputes between a contracting party and a national of the other contracting party.\n\nAward, paras. 544-545.\n\n308.\n\nPursuant to Article 9(4) of the BIT, the Tribunal was authorized, when considering and deciding the dispute, to apply also \"the principles of international law\". Therefore, it cannot be said that when taking its decision on the Respondent's objection to the admissibility of the claims based on the alleged abuse of rights, the Tribunal resorted to the law which was not applicable. Whether it was applied correctly is another matter.\n\n309.\n\nAs noted above, according to the jurisprudence, the abuse of rights has to be determined in each case in light of all circumstances of the case. That was also the approach adopted by the Tribunal.\n\n310.\n\nThe Tribunal began its factual analysis by stating that \"Mr. Sawiris himself recognized that he used the protection granted by Algeria in the different treaties at the various layers of the chain, for strategic reasons depending on the circumstances\".490\n\nAward, para. 544.\n\n311.\n\nThe Tribunal then went on to analyse Mr. Sawiris' testimony at the Hearing concluding that *\"* as explained by Mr. Sawiris, the Claimant first caused one of its subsidiaries, OTH, to bring claims against Algeria. Then, it caused a different subsidiary in the chain, Weather Investments, to threaten to bring a different arbitration in relation to the same dispute. Finally \u2013 after selling the investment \u2013 it pursued yet another investment treaty proceeding in its own name for the same investment (its past shareholding in OTA) in relation to the same host state measures and the same harm\".491\n\nAward, para. 545.\n\n312.\n\nIn its conclusive remarks, the Tribunal stressed that its findings are the result of the peculiar facts of the case, i.e., (i) the vertical integration of the group of companies of which OTMTI was part, (ii) the control of the same shareholder, (iii) the same disputed measures and (iv) the same economic harm.492\n\nAward, para. 546.\n\n313.\n\nThe Tribunal thus appears to have applied a predominantly objective standard. OTMTI's abuse appears to consist of first exerting its controlling influence in OTH and Weather Investments to make them threaten or bring claims and then later bringing its own claim.\n\n314.\n\nIn light of the above, and absent any further factual findings, OTMTI's abuse appears to be confined to bringing a claim in full knowledge of the fact that a previously controlled entity had already brought a claim in respect of the same measures but was subsequently sold to a new owner. This means that whenever the previous owner of a claim (e.g. an assignor) knowingly brings this (then meritless) claim in his or her own name, s/he already commits an abuse of rights. In other words, claimants who are aware of their lack of standing act abusively.\n\n315.\n\nThe Committee, without expressing an opinion on the application of the doctrine of abuse of rights by the Tribunal, is not convinced that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons when it found the claims inadmissible because it considered \"the Claimant's pursuit of these claims [...] an abuse of rights under the circumstances\".493 The Tribunal viewed the conduct of the Claimant who availed itself of various treaties at different levels of a vertical corporate chain, as abusive since it was \"using its rights to treaty arbitration and substantive protection in a manner that conflicts with the purposes of such rights and of investment treaties\".494\n\nAward, para. 539.\n\nAward, para. 545.\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal relied on an established legal concept under international law and it did not invent any new legal concept in this regard. A finding of abuse of rights always involved a high margin of appreciation of the facts of the case which were of decisive importance.\n\n317.\n\nIt is not the role of the annulment Committee to review the Tribunal's specific findings on the relevant facts of the case to which the Tribunal applied the concept of abuse of rights. Neither is it the role of the annulment Committee to assess whether the evidence gathered by the Tribunal justify a finding of abuse of rights. This would transform the Committee into an appellate body.\n\n318.\n\nIn the view of the Committee, the Tribunal's reasons are comprehensible and allow the reader to understand on what basis and how the Tribunal reached its conclusion. The conclusions are based on the Tribunal's evaluation of the factual circumstances of the case which the Tribunal qualified as \"peculiar\".495 The Tribunal stressed that its analysis \"concern[ed] the *admissibility* of the claim for which relief [was] sought in this arbitration, as opposed to the merits of the claims in terms of liability or quantum\".496 The \"peculiar\" facts of the case were described as follows:\n\n(i) the group of companies of which the Claimant was part was organized as a vertical chain; (ii) the entities in the chain were under the control of the same shareholder; (iii) the measures complained of by the various entities in the chain were the same and thus the dispute notified to Algeria by those entities was in essence identical; and (iv) the damage claimed by the various entities was, in its economic essence, the same.497\n\nAward, para. 546.\n\n*Ibid*. Emphasis in the original.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal summarized the arguments of the Parties. It was thus aware of these arguments and considered them in its deliberations, even if it subsequently did not address them all in its legal analysis. There is no obligation for a tribunal to address every legal argument submitted by a party if it considers it irrelevant in view of its conclusions based on other arguments and facts.\n\n320.\n\nThe Committee concludes that it cannot uphold the request of the Applicant to annul part of the Award concerning the abuse of rights on the grounds invoked under Article 52(1)(b) and (e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**VI. THE EFFECT OF THE DECISION**\n----------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Committee, upon request of the Applicant, issued on March 12, 2018 the Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award. According to that Decision \"[t]he stay of enforcement of the Award shall continue until the Decision of the Committee on the Application for Partial Annulment subject to the conditions specified in paragraphs 70 [of the Decision on the Stay of Enforcement]\".498 On May 9, 2018, the Committee issued a Decision Modifying the Conditions for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.499\n\nSee para. 39 above.\n\nSee para. 47 above.\n\n322.\n\nIn accordance with the modified conditions the Applicant deposited the amount of US$ 3,508,598.13 and \u20ac 58,382.16 due under the Award to an escrow account administered by the PCA in The Hague (NL). These amounts may only be drawn upon by Algeria by presentation of the Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee rejecting the Annulment Application. As the Committee has now decided to reject the Application for the Partial Annulment, the stay of enforcement lapses and consequently Algeria is entitled to draw the amounts due by OTMTI under the Award and which were deposited to the escrow account administered by the PCA.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**1. APPLICANT'S COST SUBMISSIONS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nIn its submissions on costs dated August 6 and 20, 2019, the Applicant argues that the Respondent should bear all costs incurred by the Applicant in connection with annulment proceedings, including fees of its counsel, its expert witnesses, translation, travel and other costs,500 as well as the ICSID costs, totaling US$ 6,982,740.37, broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Total Costs (USD)** |\n| White & Case LLP Fees | 4,890,851.30 |\n| White & Case LLP Expenses | 263,907.71 |\n| Total Legal Fees & Expenses | 5,154,759.01 |\n| Expert Fees and Costs | 239,200.81 |\n| ICSID Costs | 625,000.00501 |\n| OTMTI Arbitration Costs | 963,780.55 |\n| Total Incurred Costs | 6,982,740.37 |\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, paras. 2 and 11; Applicant's Reply Submission on Costs, para. 33.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Applicant further paid another US$ 130,000, thus totaling the ICSID costs to US$ 755,000, including the lodging fee paid for the Application.\n\n324.\n\nThe Applicant believes that \"an award of costs is warranted in the circumstances, because Algeria caused this annulment proceeding through its own significant procedural misconduct in the arbitration, which is the very subject of this annulment proceeding\".502 In the Applicant's view, Algeria \"continuously \uf8e7 and inappropriately\uf8e7 expanded the scope of the Arbitration, asserting for the very first time in its Closing Argument at the Hearing on Jurisdiction new admissibility objections and urging that the Tribunal create new law without any basis in the BIT or the ICSID Convention\".503 The Applicant submits that \"[h]ad Algeria raised its admissibility objections earlier, [\u2026] [the Claimant] would have had the opportunity to present its evidence and law to defeat those objections as without any basis in law or fact and this annulment proceeding never would have been necessary\".504 The Applicant concludes that \"[o]n this basis alone, an award of costs is warranted, irrespective of whether [it] prevails in its application for partial annulment\".505 The Applicant, however, believes that it \"should prevail in this proceedings and therefore should be awarded its costs and legal fees insofar as they are reasonable\".506\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, para. 4.\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, para. 4.\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, para. 4.\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, para. 4.\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, para. 10.\n\n**2. RESPONDENT'S COST SUBMISSIONS**\n------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nIn its submissions on costs, the Respondent submits that the Applicant should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings, including the Respondent's legal fees and expenses totaling US$ 4,627,031.21 (which also includes taxes).507 The Responden t argues that the more recent practice of annulment committees has been to decide that the unsuccessful applicant for annulment shall bear all ICSID costs, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the *ad hoc* committee.508 The Respondent further submits that its legal fees and expenses shall be fully reimbursed by the Applicant in view of the fact that the application for annulment is \"manifestly unfounded\" (\"*manifestement infond\u00e9*\") and that the Applicant acted in \"bad faith\" (\"*mauvaise foi*\") and engaged in procedural \"misconduct\" (\"*comportement d\u00e9loyal*\").509\n\nRespondent's Reply Submission on Costs, paras. 33 and 34.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, paras. 8 and 9, with references to a number of annulment decisions rendered between 2007 and 2017.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 13.\n\n**3. COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------\n\n326.\n\nIt is useful to recall the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules on the costs of the proceedings. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which is contained in its Chapter VI titled \"Cost of Proceedings\", provides:\n\n[T]he Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award.\n\nRule 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules implementing that provision states that \"[t]he award shall be in writing and shall contain [\u2026] any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding\".\n\n327.\n\nIn accordance with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Article 61(2), being part of Chapter VI, \"shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee\". Rule 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules specifies that these Rules \"*s* hall apply *mutatis mutandis* to any procedure relating to the [...] annulment of an award and to the decision of the [\u2026] Committee\".\n\n328.\n\nBoth Parties recognize that under the above-mentioned provisions the Committee enjoys discretion in allocating the costs.510\n\nApplicant's Submission on Costs, para. 3 and Applicant's Reply Submission on Costs, para. 2; Respondent's Submission on Costs, para. 6 and Respondent's Reply Submission on Costs, para. 6.\n\n329.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation 14(3)(e), the Applicant made the advance payments requested by ICSID to cover the costs of the annulment proceeding (costs and expenses of the Centre and fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee; \"**ICSID costs**\").\n\n330.\n\nICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e) provides that:\n\n[I]n the event that an application for annulment of an award is registered [\u2026] the applicant shall be solely responsible for making the advance payments requested by the Secretary-General to cover expenses following the constitution of the Committee, and without prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with Article 52(4) of the Convention to decide how and by whom expenses incurred in connection with the annulment proceedings shall be paid.\n\nAs the *ad hoc* Committee in *MCI* v. *Ecuador* stated, the \"consequence of this rule [\u2026] should normally be that the applicant, when annulment is refused, remains responsible for these costs\".511 The Applicant was not successful with its Application for Partial Annulment which the Committee decided to reject. As a consequence, the Committee decides that the ICSID costs (including the fees and expenses of the Committee Members) shall be borne by the Applicant.\n\n*MCI* v. *Ecuador*, Decision on Annulment, October 19, 2009, para. 88. See also *Tulip* v. *Turkey*, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015, para. 230; *Po\u0161tov\u00e1 Banka, a.s.. and Istrokapital SE* v. *Hellenic Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/8), Decision on Annulment, September 29, 2016, para. 170.\n\n331.\n\nAlthough the Application was not successful, the Committee does not share the Respondent's view that the grounds which it invoked were \"manifestly without merit\" (\"*manifestement infond\u00e9s*\").512 The Application was certainly not frivolous. It raised a number of important points in relation to two rather novel issues in the field of investment arbitration, namely the preclusive effect of the notice of dispute in the context when several notices of dispute were sent by the companies organized in the vertical chain, all being under the control of the same shareholder, and the abuse of rights which the Tribunal found in the circumstances of the case. The Committee further notes that counsel for the Applicant, while vigorously defending the interests of its client, acted in a professional and courteous manner.\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, para. 23. Emphasis added.\n\n332.\n\nThe Committee shares the view of the *ad hoc* Committee in *EDF* v. *Argentina* that \"[t]here is no general rule in ICSID proceedings that the losing party should pay the successful party's costs, nor is there even a presumption in favour of such an outcome\".513\n\n*EDF* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, February 5, 2016, para. 389. In footnote 445 the Committee contrasted this to the position under Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, under which the starting point is a presumption that the unsuccessful party must bear the whole costs of the Tribunal. It should be noted that the UNCITRAL Rules were originally drafted for commercial arbitration.\n\n333.\n\nIn view of the above factors, the Committee decides that each Party shall bear its own costs for the legal representation and the expenses it incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n**VIII. LANGUAGES OF THE PROCEEDING AND OF THE DECISION**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nThe proceeding has been conducted in English and French. The Applicant made its submissions in English, and the Respondent in French. The Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee is issued in both languages, English and French, which are, in accordance with Rule 22(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules equally authentic. The Decision was originally drafted in English and subsequently translated into French. In case of any discrepancy between the two versions, the English version shall be deemed to reflect the meaning intended by the Committee.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n335.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee unanimously decides:\n\n(1) OTMTI's Application for Partial Annulment is rejected.\n\n(2) In accordance with the terms of paragraph 73(1) of the Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award that Decision will cease to have effect on the date of issue of the present Decision and accordingly Algeria is entitled to draw the amounts due by OTMTI under the Award which were deposited to the escrow account administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.\n\n(3) OTMTI shall bear all ICSID costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n(4) Each Party shall bear the costs for its legal representation and its expenses in the annulment proceeding."}]}
