PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn February 8, 2021, **Optima Ventures LLC** and **Optima 7171 LLC**, two companies incorporated in the State of Delaware, indirectly owned and controlled by nationals of Ukraine, filed with ICSID a request for arbitration under the ICSID Convention and the 1994 US-Ukraine Bilateral Investment Treaty, against the United States of America. On February 25, 2021, ICSID received a similar request for arbitration from **Optima Ventures LLC** and **Optima 55 Public Square LLC** (also a Delaware incorporated company).\n\n2.\n\nOn March 16, 2021, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered both requests for arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6(1)(a) and 7(a) of the ICSID Institution Rules and notified the parties of the registration. The cases were registered as ICSID cases Nos. ARB/21/11 and ARB/21/12.\n\n3.\n\nOn June 11, 2021, the parties agreed to discontinue case No. ARB/21/12 and amend case No. ARB/21/11 to include Optima Ventures LLC, Optima 7171 LLC and Optima 55 Public Square LLC as claimants.\n\n4.\n\nOn June 16, 2021, the Secretary-General issued a Procedural Order Taking Note of the Discontinuance of case No. ARB/21/12 pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(1).1\n\nAll references to Arbitration Rules in the present decision are to the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings which came into effect on April 10, 2006.\n\n5.\n\nBy communication of June 16, 2021, the Centre took note that the parties had agreed on the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment, in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 2(1). Pursuant to the parties' agreement, the Tribunal would comprise three members, one appointed by the Claimants, one appointed by the Respondent, and the third, presiding, arbitrator who would be appointed by agreement of the parties. Should the parties fail to agree on the presiding arbitrator, the Secretary-General of ICSID would make the missing appointment, in accordance with a formula agreed by the parties. The parties also agreed to derogate from nationality restrictions, as permitted by Article 39 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule (1)(3).\n\n6.\n\nIn accordance with the parties' agreement, the Claimants appointed Professor Jan Paulsson, a national of Bahrain, France, and Sweden, as an arbitrator. Prof. Paulsson accepted his appointment on June 21, 2021. The Respondent in turn appointed Mr. M., a US national. Mr. M. accepted his appointment on July 30, 2021.\n\n7.\n\nBetween June 2021 and April 2022, the parties, with the assistance of ICSID, endeavoured to agree on the name of the presiding arbitrator. As the parties failed to reach an agreement, on June 23, 2022, the Secretary-General appointed Prof. M\u00f3nica Pinto, a national of Argentina, as president of the tribunal. Prof. Pinto accepted her appointment on July 6, 2022.\n\n8.\n\nOn July 6, 2022, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Secretary-General notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted, and the proceeding to have begun, on that date.\n\n9.\n\nOn July 15, 2022, the Claimants filed a proposal to disqualify Mr. M. as arbitrator. In accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention, the Disqualification Proposal would be decided by Professors Pinto and Paulsson.\n\n10.\n\nOn July 16, 2022, the Centre confirmed receipt of the Proposal and informed the parties that in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding would be suspended until a decision on the Proposal had been taken.\n\n11.\n\nOn the same date, the Centre conveyed to the parties and to Mr. M. a schedule for the parties' submissions on the Proposal and for Mr. M.'s explanations (if any), fixed by Professors Pinto and Paulsson.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 29, 2022, in accordance with the fixed schedule, the Respondent filed comments on the Disqualification Proposal (\"**Respondents Comments**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn August 5, 2022, Mr. M. furnished explanations, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).\n\n14.\n\nOn August 15, 2022, the parties simultaneously filed final observations on the Disqualification Proposal (**\"Claimants' Observations\"** and **\"Respondent's Further Observations\"**).\n\n15.\n\nOn August 29, 2022, Professors Pinto and Paulsson informed the Secretary-General that they had failed to reach a decision on the Disqualification Proposal. In accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4), the Disqualification Proposal would be accordingly decided by the Chair of the Administrative Council.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. C****laimants****' D****isqualification** **P****roposal and** **O****bservations**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants seek to disqualify arbitrator Mr. M. pursuant to Articles 14 (1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9, on account that he manifestly lacks the impartiality and independence required to serve as an arbitrator due to:2\n\na. Mr. M.'s prior employment relationship with the United States;\n\nb. Mr. M.'s current and ongoing employment by the United States;\n\nc. Mr. M.'s stance on the interplay between customary international law and US domestic law;\n\nd. Mr. M.'s alleged access to confidential information concerning individuals with interests in this case; and\n\ne. Mr. M.'s acquiescence to practices contrary to international law.3\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 104.\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 105.\n\n**(1) Applicable Legal Standard**\n---------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimants recall that Article 57 of the ICSID Convention permits the disqualification of an arbitrator on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14 (1) which provides: \"Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgement.*\"*4.\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 97.\n\n18.\n\nThe Claimants note that: (i) \"[it] is well established that this standard includes both the concepts of impartiality and independence and requires that the arbitrators appointed avoid even the *appearance* of dependence or bias, as evaluated by a third party-observer\"5; and (ii) disqualification under the ICSID Convention \"do[es] not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.\"6\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 1.\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 98.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants submit that ICSID tribunals determining disqualification proposals have looked to the *IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration* (IBA Guidelines) for guidance.7\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6\u00b6 99-102.\n\n20.\n\nFinally, the Claimants, in response to the Respondent's Comments of July 29, 2022, submit that the assertions in the Disqualification Proposal need to be viewed cumulatively,8 to enable \"all of the circumstances\u2026 to be considered in order to determine whether the relationship is significant enough to justify entertaining reasonable doubts as to the capacity of the arbitrator or member to render a decision freely and independently.\"9\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 106.\n\nClaimants' Observations \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n\n**(2) Mr. M.'s prior employment relationship with the United States**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimants note that Mr. M. has \"an extensive [\u2026] employment relationship with the United States federal government,\" having served for approximately 20 years \"as an employee and/or official of the United States government, holding various high-level roles during this time.\"10\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6\u00b6 2, 29.\n\n22.\n\nAfter describing Mr. M.'s long career in the US public sector \u2013 culminating with his tenure as Secretary of Homeland Security from 2005 through 2009 - Claimants assert that this \"extensive relationship and alignment with the United States and its policies at the very least creates an appearance that Mr. M. will lack impartiality and/or independence in presiding over this matter.\"11\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 112.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the IBA Guidelines to support their position, arguing that Mr. M.'s long tenure as a US Government official falls squarely within item 3.4.2. of the Guidelines *Orange List, i.e.,* \"[t]he arbitrator has been associated with a party or an affiliate of one of the parties, in a professional capacity, such as a former employee or partner,\" creating, at the very least, an appearance of bias.12\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 115.\n\n24.\n\nFurther, the Claimants allege that: (i) \"a review of ICSID decisions on disqualification confirms that it is unprecedented for a party to appoint its own former high-ranking official as an arbitrator;\" (ii) \"considerable evidence shows that decision-makers are biased in favor of their home countries;\" and (iii) \"Article 39 of the ICSID Convention implicitly recognizes this reality by providing that '[t]he majority of arbitrators shall be nationals of States other than the Contracting State party to the dispute and the Contracting State whose national is a party to the dispute.'\"13\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 117.\n\n25.\n\nIn conclusion, the Disqualification Proposal claims that \"Mr. M.'s decades-long career as a high-ranking United States government official who played an influential role in the development and execution of United States policy\u2014including policy concerning conflicts between United States domestic law and international law, as well as the United States' use of asset forfeiture\u2014indisputably raises profound questions about Mr. M.'s ability to remain independent and impartial during the course of this arbitration.\"14\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 121.\n\n**(3) Mr. M.'s current employment with the US Government**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants note that Mr. M. has served as a member of the US Homeland Security Advisory Council (\"HSAC\") since March 2022, assisting the current Secretary of Homeland Security to \"develop strategies in the domestic and international domains,\" and providing him with \"independent advice and recommendations.\"15\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6\u00b6 8, 43-45.\n\n27.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, members of HSAC are considered to be \"'Special Government Employees' as defined in section 202(a) of Title 18 United States Code.\"16\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 47.\n\n28.\n\nRelying on the IBA Guidelines, the Claimants describe Mr. M.'s current relationship with the US as a circumstance that \"necessarily raise[s] justifiable doubts as to a candidate's independence and impartiality,\" which falls in the Non-Waivable and Waivable Red Lists.17\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 108. Non-Waivable Red List Items 1.1 There is an identity between a party and the arbitrator, or the arbitrator is a legal representative or employee of an entity that is a party in the arbitration, and 1.4 The arbitrator or his or her firm regularly advises the party, or an affiliate of the party, and the arbitrator or his or her firm derives significant financial income therefrom. Waivable Red List Items 2.3.1. The arbitrator currently represents or advises one of the parties, or an affiliate of one of the parties, and 2.3.7. \"The arbitrator regularly advises one of the parties, or an affiliate of one of the parties, but neither the arbitrator nor his or her firm derives a significant financial income therefrom.\"\n\n29.\n\nIn addition, the Disqualification Proposal claims that Mr. M. failed to notify ICSID or the parties that he had accepted a role with HSAC. Claimants submit that this failure breached Mr. M.'s continuing obligation to notify the Centre of any subsequent relationship or circumstance that may put in question his reliability for independent judgment, required under Arbitration Rule 6(2).18\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 111.\n\n30.\n\nIn response to Respondent's Comments, the Claimants' assert that Mr. M.'s affiliation with HSAC is an \"unwaivable conflict that mandates [his] disqualification.\" Addressing Mr. M.'s explanations of August 5, 2022, the Claimants assert that his conditional offer to resign from HSAC if the Tribunal approves his continued role as arbitrator further demonstrates this conflict.19\n\nClaimants' Observations \u00b6 3.\n\n**(4) Mr. M.'s stance on the interplay between customary international law and US domestic law**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants note that while employed by the US Government, Mr. M. gave lectures and wrote articles setting forth his views on the interplay between the domestic enforcement of US law and customary international law.20\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 48.\n\n32.\n\nIn these articles and lectures, Mr. M. expressed scepticism towards customary international law, suggesting that it has developed in a manner that is biased against the United States and advocating against its encroachment on the ability of the United States to manage its domestic affairs.21\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 49; Mr. M., *The Responsibility to Contain: Protecting Sovereignty Under International Law*, Foreign Affairs, Jan.-Feb. 2009 [C-28]; *Mr. M. on International Law,* Nov. 17, 2006 (Audio Recording). [C-29].\n\n33.\n\nIn particular, the Disqualification Proposal points to an explicit statement made by Mr. M. in 2009, that the US domestic system for justice should not be subject to any limitations imposed by international law.22\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 52; [C-28].\n\n34.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants note that as a federal prosecutor, Mr. M. advocated for the US Government's use of asset forfeitures, especially when the asset was allegedly obtained using funds gained as a result of illegal activity, an issue that is central to this arbitration.23\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6\u00b6 54-57.\n\n35.\n\nClaimants affirm that an arbitrator can be disqualified on the basis of public statements24 and that a \"reasonable interpretation\" of Mr. M.'s comments \"give rise to justifiable doubts about his impartiality,\" making disqualification appropriate.\n\nClaimants' Observations \u00b6 9.\n\n**(5) Mr. M.'s alleged access to confidential information concerning individuals with interests in this case**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, as a result of his prominent position as Secretary of Homeland Security, Mr. M. was likely privy to confidential information about the Claimants. Given the political turmoil in Ukraine while he was in office, the Claimants assert that a reasonable observer would presume that Mr. M. acquired information about the Claimants that might influence his decision in this case.25\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 148.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that Mr. M. may have gained access to additional confidential information following his return to the private sector, as he was affiliated with and represented competitors of the main shareholders of the Claimants in this case.\n\n38.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Mr. M. must be disqualified because his access to confidential information contributes to the \"appearance of lack of impartiality or independence based on a reasonable evaluation of the facts in the present case.\"26\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 150.\n\n**(6) Mr. M.'s acquiescence to practices contrary to international law**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Disqualification Proposal claims that following the events of September 11, 2001, agencies from the US Government engaged in interrogation techniques of suspected terrorists that were contrary to a \"reasonable interpretation of international law.\"27\n\nClaimants' Observations \u00b6 11.\n\n40.\n\nThe Disqualification Proposal extensively describes the events that followed the September 11 attacks, US inter-agency discussions and legal reports on the interrogation techniques used, and Mr. M.'s alleged contribution, in his capacity as Assistant Attorney General at the Criminal Division of the US Department of Justice, to an aggressive interpretation of international law that authorized these practices. According to the Claimants, this evidences \"\u2026a willingness to tolerate excesses and oversteps in favor of the policy preferences of his home country.\"28\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n41.\n\nThe Disqualification Proposal asserts that Mr. M. acquiesced in and contributed to legal interpretations that are indefensible under international law, with the intention of benefitting the public interests of his home country, which evidence a lack of impartiality.29\n\nClaimants' Observations \u00b6 13.\n\n**B. T****he** **R****espondent****'****s** **O****bservations and** **R****esponse**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the proposal to disqualify Mr. M., arguing that:\n\na. Mr. M.'s former employment with the US does not present a conflict;\n\nb. Mr. M.'s role on the HSAC does not require his disqualification;\n\nc. None of Mr. M.'s public statements concerning international law and prosecution of asset forfeiture give rise to an \"issue conflict;\"\n\nd. Allegations that Mr. M. may have obtained confidential information about the claimants are mere speculation and should be rejected; and\n\ne. Mr. M.'s contribution to an allegedly wrongful interpretation of certain conduct is irrelevant.\n\n**(1) Applicable Legal Standard**\n---------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nLike the Claimants, the US submits that the standard for disqualification of an arbitrator under the ICSID Convention is enshrined in Articles 14(1) and 57 of the ICSID Convention, pursuant to which arbitrators shall be \"persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\" The US also agrees that this standard encompasses the requirements of independence and impartiality.30\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 2.\n\n44.\n\nThe US submits that: (i) Article 57 requires a party to establish facts \"indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required\" by Article 14(1); (ii) the burden of proof on a challenge lies with the party bringing the proposal to disqualify; (iii) facts indicating a manifest lack of those qualities must be established through \"objective evidence that a reasonable third party would uphold\"; (iv) manifest lack of those qualities cannot be based on the subjective perceptions of the challenging party; and (v) a party seeking to disqualify an arbitrator may not rely on speculation or unfounded assertions to prove the facts in support of its challenge.31\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 3.\n\n**(2) Mr. M.'s former employment with the US does not present a conflict**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees that Mr. M.'s former employment with the US government must result in his disqualification.32\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 21.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent notes that Mr. M.'s employment with the US ended in 2009, twelve years prior to his appointment in this case. Mr. M. has worked solely in the private sector since then.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that Mr. M.'s prior employment with the US Government was disclosed in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at the time of his appointment and acceptance. According to the US, the Claimants could have requested clarifications or further disclosures from Mr. M. at any time since July 2021, if his employment history had been a concern to them.33\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 24.\n\n48.\n\nThe US submits that the Claimants have not pointed to any decision disqualifying an arbitrator solely based on their prior government service and that there are many instances where former government officials served as arbitrators in investor-State arbitrations.34\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 25.\n\n49.\n\nFinally, the US addresses Claimants' suggestion that Mr. M. cannot be unbiased simply because he possesses US nationality, noting that the parties' agreed method of constitution of the Tribunal expressly derogated from any nationality requirement.35\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 26.\n\n**(3) Mr. M.'s advisory role with the Department of Homeland Security does not require his disqualification**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe US disagrees with Claimants' submission that Mr. M.'s role in HSAC mandates his disqualification. The US accepts, however, that Mr. M. may not continue serving in both roles concurrently.36\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 14.\n\n51.\n\nThe US claims that the subject matter covered by HSAC differs from the issues in dispute in this case and that there is no indication on the record that Mr. M. is advising on any issue that could plausibly be related to this arbitration. The US further states that \"HSAC members receive no compensation, no per diem, and no honorarium, and although some travel expenses may be reimbursable, our understanding from a recent inquiry with DHS is that Mr. M. has neither requested nor received any such reimbursement.\"37\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 17.\n\n52.\n\nIn its Further Observations, the Respondent acknowledges that the IBA Guidelines Waivable Red List concerns *concurrent* advisory services to a party, but contends that Mr. M.'s advisory role with HSAC does not present grounds for disqualification because (i) he offered to resign from the HSAC position in his August 5, 2022 explanations; (ii) the overlap between his role in HSAC and as an arbitrator in this matter was brief; (iii) this arbitration is at an early stage; and, (iv) no reasonable third party would conclude that Mr. M.'s short period of overlapping service indicates a manifest lack of independence or impartiality in these proceedings.38\n\nRespondent's Further Observations \u00b6 4.\n\n**(4) Mr. M.'s public statements concerning international law and prosecution of asset forfeiture cannot give rise to a conflict**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe US asserts that it \"has long been recognized that the mere expression of an opinion, even where the issue may be relevant in a particular arbitration, cannot without more sustain an arbitrator challenge for lack of independence or impartiality\" and that \"scholarly expressions of views that do not address a specific case, standing alone, are not normally cause for removal.\"39\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 28, referring to the *Report of the ASIL-ICCA Joint Taskforce on Issue Conflicts in**Investor-State Arbitration*, the ICCA Reports No. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 116-17.\n\n54.\n\nThe US claims that Mr. M.'s statements \"did not amount to legal advice, expert opinion, or advocacy of a position on this dispute or in this specific case\" and that his generalized statements concerning the relationship between international and domestic law or his statements or prior advocacy concerning asset forfeiture in general, are not sufficient bases to uphold a challenge.40\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6\u00b6 28, 34.\n\n55.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' assertions that Mr. M. cannot be impartial on asset forfeiture issues due to his former roles with the US Department of Justice.41 Respondent notes that Claimants did not point to any opinions or public advocacy of Mr. M. on the issue of asset forfeiture.42\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 33.\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 34\n\n**(5) Mr. M.'s alleged access to confidential information concerning individuals with interest in the case**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nRespondent submits that (i) the Claimants failed to establish that Mr. M. obtained confidential information about the Claimants through his previous positions, portraying Claimants' allegations as \"unwarranted presumptions\"; and (ii) no link was established between the Claimants' speculations and the qualities required by Art. 14(1).43\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6\u00b6 35-36.\n\n**(6) Claimants' arguments concerning interrogation techniques are irrelevant and should be stricken from the record.**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe US submits that the Claimants' arguments on issues related to interrogation techniques have no bearing on Mr. M.'s ability to remain impartial and are an attempt to discredit Mr. M. and undermine his standing within the Tribunal.44\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6 7.\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal strike these arguments in the Claimants' submission from the record, as they amount to \"\u2026an unsolicited submission and is wholly irrelevant to the proposal to disqualify Mr. M.\"45\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b6\u00b6 7-12.\n\n**C. M****r****. M.'****s** **C****omments**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nIn accordance with the schedule and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3), Mr. M. furnished explanations on August 5, 2022, as follows:\n\n*\"I, Mr. M., respectfully submit these comments in response to Claimants' Proposal to disqualify me as Arbitrator and the Comments by the United States.*\n\n*To be clear: I have no partiality for or against any party in this case, have no knowledge of the underlying facts other than what was set forth in filings in this arbitration, and have no settled views on the legal issues presented herein. The Tribunal is familiar with the relevant law, and I will simply set forth facts that are relevant to the pending proposal.*\n\n*I.*\n\n*Regarding my financially uncompensated role as a member of the Homeland Security Advisory Committee, no element of my participation has involved any subject matter or people related to the current arbitration. Nevertheless, if the Tribunal approves my continued role as an arbitrator, I will withdraw from and terminate participation in the Homeland Advisory Committee.*\n\n*II.*\n\n*Regarding the speculation regarding any connection between myself and Dmitry Firtash and Victor Pinchuk:*\n\n*I represented Firtash in contesting the United States Department of Justice effort to extradite him on US criminal charges alleging improper payments to officials in India. That representation ended in 2019. The issues in that matter had nothing to do with the Claimants or claims at issue here. Indeed, I had never heard of the current Claimants until I was invited to this arbitration, well after the Firtash representation ended.*\n\n*I have never represented Pinchuk and my only contact with him has been because both he and I are members of the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, which is focused on efforts to safeguard democratic elections, and which is populated by a number of former senior public officials. Pinchuk has never discussed with me the Claimants or claims in this matter.*\n\n*III.*\n\n*My service as a Federal prosecutor and as Assistant Attorney General did not involve the issues or individuals that are part of this proceeding. I left the US Department of Justice over a decade ago, and during much of my legal career I was a defense attorney representing individuals who challenged and were adverse to the Justice Department. Thus, as a lawyer I have both supported and contested the positions of the Department.*\n\n*In particular, as Assistant Attorney General I did not direct the disposition of terrorist detainees. I did specifically decline to provide any advance immunity for anyone who committed a criminal violation in the treatment of detainees.*\n\n*IV.*\n\n*Regarding the claims that years ago I expressed a generally negative view of international law, the quoted remark is extracted from a 2009 Foreign Affairs article which I authored. The article does not generally oppose application of international law and does not speak to the issues in this arbitration. Indeed, the article endorses bilateral agreements and international law, especially as they relate to \"activities involving the transport of goods, people, or money from one country to another \u2014 such as air travel, cargo transportation, and cross-border financial transactions. International law is particularly appropriate for regulating such activities due to their quintessentially international character.\" [Foreign Affairs, Volume 88, No. 1, p. 130, at p.141 (Jan/Feb 2009]*\n\n*V.*\n\n*In short, I have no prior personal or professional connection with the individuals or factual or legal issues presented in this Arbitration. I have adopted no views as to the issues involved. As a former appellate Judge, I am well aware of how important it is that adjudication be free of bias or prejudgment I can assure the Tribunal and parties here that I am and will be impartial. There is no reasonable basis to doubt that.\"*\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Chair of the Administrative Council has considered all of the parties' submissions but will refer to them only to the extent that they are relevant for the present Decision.\n\n**A. T****imeliness**\n---------------------\n\n61.\n\nArbitration Rule 9 (1) requires a proposal for disqualification to be filed \"promptly.\"46 As the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules do not specify a number of days within which a disqualification proposal must be filed, the timeliness of a disqualification proposal must be determined on a case-by-case basis.47\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 9(1): \"A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.\"\n\n*See, e.g., Misen Energy AB (publ) and Misen Enterprises AB v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/21/15), Decision on the Respondent's Proposal to Disqualify Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov of April 15, 2022, \u00b6114 (\"*Misen*\"), and cases cited therein.\n\n62.\n\nThe Proposal was filed on July 15, 2022, *i.e.,* 9 days after the Tribunal constitution. The parties have not challenged the promptness of the Proposal, nor have they addressed timeliness in their submissions. Based on the information reviewed, the Chair is satisfied that the Proposal was submitted in a timely manner as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (1).\n\n**B. T****he** **A****pplicable** **L****egal** **S****tandard**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Proposal seeks to disqualify arbitrator Mr. M. pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. The Proposal does not question Mr. M.'s high moral character or that he has competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry, or finance, as required by Article 14 (1) of the ICSID Convention. The Proposal challenges Mr. M.'s reliability to exercise independent and impartial judgement.48\n\nDisqualification Proposal \u00b6 104.\n\n64.\n\nAs noted above, Article 57 of the ICSID Convention provides in relevant part that:\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.*\n\n65.\n\nA number of decisions have concluded that the word \"manifest\" in this provision means \"evident\" or \"obvious\", and that it relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived.49\n\n*See* *Blue Bank International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20), Decision on the Parties' Proposal to Disqualify a Majority of the Tribunal, November 12, 2013 (\"*Blue Bank*\"), \u00b661; *Misen* \u00b6101; *VM Solar Jerez GmbH and others v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/19/30), Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Prof. Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil, October 18, 2022, (\"*VM Solar*\"), \u00b6 83*; Orazul International Espa\u00f1a Holdings S.L. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/19/25), Decision on Disqualification of Dr. Inka Hanefeld, September 11, 2022, (\"*Orazul*\") \u00b6 47; and cases cited therein; *See also* C. Schreuer The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, Third Edition (2022), p. 1578-1579 \u00b6\u00b6 37-42.\n\n66.\n\nArticles 57 and 14 (1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather, it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.50\n\n*See, e.g; Misen* \u00b6105*; VM Solar \u00b6 87; Orazul \u00b6 39*; and cases cited therein.\n\n67.\n\nThe parties agree that Article 14 of the ICSID Convention requires arbitrators to be both independent and impartial.51\n\nSee *supra* \u00b6\u00b6 18 and 43.\n\n68.\n\nIt is also common ground between the parties that the legal standard applied to a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator is an \"objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.\" Accordingly, the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.52\n\n*See, e.g; Blue Bank* \u00b660, *VM Solar* \u00b688; *Misen* \u00b6105-106; and cases cited therein.\n\n69.\n\nBoth parties have referred to the IBA Guidelines. While the IBA Guidelines may serve as a useful reference, the Chair is bound by the standard set forth in the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, this Decision is made in accordance with Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(1) Mr. M.'s prior employment relationship with the United States**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nClaimants' *first* proposed ground to disqualify Mr. M. is that his extensive career in the US public sector would affect his impartiality.\n\n71.\n\nThe US disagrees, noting that (a) Mr. M.'s prior employment with the US Government ended in 2009; and (b) this fact was known by the Claimants at the time Mr. M. was appointed to the Tribunal in June 2021 and that they did object to it.\n\n72.\n\nThe Chair is mindful that under the ICSID Convention and Rules, the Claimants could not raise a formal challenge to Mr. M.'s appointment until the Tribunal was constituted and that, as noted in \u00b662 above, they promptly did so.\n\n73.\n\nIn the Chair's view, Mr. M.'s prior service in the US administration does not, by itself, justify his exclusion from the Tribunal.\n\n74.\n\nNothing in the ICSID Convention, Rules or Regulations restricts the appointment as arbitrators of individuals who have served in government.53 The ICSID Panels of Conciliators and Arbitrators include individuals appointed by Contracting States who have served in the public sector in their respective countries of origin or other States.54\n\nArticle 12 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"qualified persons\" who \"are willing to serve as arbitrators or conciliators.\" Pursuant to Article 14 appointees shall be \"persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\" Article 39, in turn, establishes nationality limitations to the appointment of arbitrators. The *Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States*, highlights the flexible character of ICSID proceedings, which gives the parties freedom to select arbitrators, as long as the appointees possess the qualities stated in Article 14 (1).\n\n*See Considerations for States in Designating Arbitrators and Conciliators to the ICSID Panels* in the ICSID website, where it is stated: \"Designees can be identified from a broad range of professional backgrounds and experiences that may include \u2026former government officials and diplomats with experience in international matters\" and \"[w]hile the ICSID Convention does not prohibit designation of currently serving government officials, their designation may pose a higher risk of a challenge based on their employment relationship with a State. Former government officials do not pose a similar risk and have acted frequently in ICSID cases.\"\n\n75.\n\nIn fact, parties in investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) proceedings frequently appoint individuals with experience in the public sector as arbitrators. There are numerous examples of ISDS cases, under the ICSID Convention, ICSID Additional Facility Rules and other sets of arbitration rules, where prior government service has not been seen, in and of itself, as a basis to exclude a person from service as an arbitrator.55\n\n*E.g.,* in *Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1) and in *Robert Azinian et al v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/97/2), the US claimants appointed Benjamin R. Civiletti a former US Attorney General, as arbitrator; in *Bayview Irrigation District and others v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/1), the Canadian claimants appointed Edwin Meese III, also a former US Attorney General; in *Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23), the claimants appointed Stuart E. Eizenstat, a former US Ambassador to the European Union and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury; in *Inversi\u00f3n y Gesti\u00f3n de Bienes, IGB, S.L. and IGB18 Las Rozas, S.L. v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/17), the parties jointly appointed Rodrigo Oreamuno, a former vice-president of Costa Rica as the sole arbitrator; in *Vento Motorcycles, Inc. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/17/3), Mexico appointed as arbitrator Hugo Perezcano Diaz, formerly Mexico's lead counsel in NAFTA Chapter 11 cases and Head of Mexico's Trade Remedy Authority; in *Ethyl Corporation v. The Government of Canada*, the first NAFTA Chapter 11 case against Canada, the State appointed Marc Lalonde, a former Minister of Finance, Justice and Attorney-General of Canada; in the NAFTA Article 1126 consolidated proceedings of *Canfor/Tembec/Terminal Forest Ltd. v. United States of America*, the US appointed Davis R. Robinson, a former Legal Adviser to the US Department of State; in *Jos\u00e9 Alejandro Hern\u00e1ndez Contreras v. Republic of Costa Rica (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/20/2)*, the parties jointly appointed Felipe Bulnes Serrano, a former Minister of Education and Justice of Chile, as president of the Tribunal; and in *Bay View Group LLC and The Spalena Company LLC v. Republic of Rwanda* (ICSID Case No. ARB/18/21), the parties jointly appointed Sir Nicholas Phillips, who served as the first president of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, as the president of the Tribunal. It is noted that Mr. M. himself served as arbitrator appointed by the Claimant in the case of *Detroit International Bridge Company v. Government of Canada*.\n\n76.\n\nIn the present case, this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the governmental service concerned concluded more than 12 years ago, following Mr. M.'s tenure as Secretary of Homeland Security from 2005 through 2009.\n\n77.\n\nThe Disqualification Proposal appears to suggest additionally that Mr. M. cannot be unbiased because he is a US national. The Claimants have not proposed Mr. M.'s disqualification on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal for reasons of nationality, as envisaged in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. While Article 39 of the ICSID Convention restricts in principle the appointment of arbitrators of the same nationality as the disputing parties, the restriction does not apply in the present case, where the parties agreed to derogate from the nationality rules, as expressly permitted under Article 39.\n\n78.\n\nBased on the circumstances of this case, the Chair concludes that an objective third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the facts would not conclude that Mr. M..'s prior service in the US Government would evidence, by itself, a manifest lack of the impartiality and independence required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, this aspect of the disqualification proposal is rejected.\n\n**(2) Mr. M.'s current employment with the US Government**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\n*Second*, the Claimants argue that Mr. M. maintains a professional relationship with the Respondent following his March 2022 appointment to the US HSAC. According to the Claimants, this appointment makes Mr. M. a \"Special Government Employee\" under US law.\n\n80.\n\nIt its reply, the US asserts that the subject matter covered by HSAC is different from the issues in dispute in this case56 and challenges the existence of an \"employment relationship\" between Mr. M. and the US, noting that HSAC members receive no compensation for their service.\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b616 \"[t]here is no indication that Mr. M. is advising on any issues that could plausibly be the subject matter of the present arbitration in his capacity on the HSAC.\"\n\n81.\n\nThe US, however, acknowledges that \"Mr. M. should not serve in both capacities concurrently,\" understanding \"that Mr. M. will address this issue \u2026 [and] advise the parties as to whether he intends to resign from the HSAC or from this Tribunal.\"57\n\nRespondent's Comments \u00b619.\n\n82.\n\nIn his explanations, quoted in full above, Mr. M. states: \"*Regarding my financially uncompensated role as a member of the Homeland Security Advisory Committee, no element of my participation has involved any subject matter or people related to the current arbitration. Nevertheless, if the Tribunal approves my continued role as an arbitrator, I will withdraw from and terminate participation in the Homeland Advisory Committee.\"*\n\n83.\n\nThere is no dispute about whether Mr. M. received compensation for his service at HSAC. It is also clear from the record that Mr. M.'s functions at HSAC and as arbitrator overlapped only for a short period. More importantly, the parties and Mr. M. appear to agree that there is an inherent incompatibility between these two roles.\n\n84.\n\nThe parties disagree however, as to whether Mr. M. is an \"employee\" of the US and, more substantially, if the fact that Mr. M. is presently advising the US, a party to the dispute, is a sufficient ground to disqualify him\n\n85.\n\nIn the Chair's view, this second disqualification ground is well-founded. By serving on a tribunal in an arbitration while simultaneously acting as an advisor to one of the disputing parties, albeit in different matters, the arbitrator inevitably risks creating an appearance that he lacks impartiality and independence.\n\n86.\n\nThe fact that Mr. M. has received no compensation does not remove this appearance. While the arbitrator may be confident in his/her own impartiality, the arbitrator could reasonably be perceived by an objective third party as more attentive to the interests of the party being advised and his/her judgment may appear to be impaired by the potential interest of the advised party in the proceeding.\n\n87.\n\nThe Chair notes that under the IBA Guidelines, which both parties have referred to with approval, this situation would fall under the Waivable Red List, *i.e.,* situations that, while serious, could be waived only if and when the parties, being aware of the conflict, \"expressly state their willingness to have such a person act as arbitrator.\" That is not the case in the present situation, where the Claimants strongly oppose Mr. M.'s continued participation in the Tribunal.\n\n88.\n\nMr. M. has indicated that \"*if the Tribunal approves my continued role as an arbitrator, I will withdraw from and terminate participation in the Homeland Advisory Committee*.\" The US has argued that \"[t]here are no grounds to disqualify Mr. M. solely on the basis of his membership on the HSAC given his offer to resign immediately from that Committee \u2026[u]pon Mr. M.'s resignation, there will no longer be any concurrent service or possible conflict.\"\n\n89.\n\nMr. M.'s explanations and the US' comments suggest that the appearance of conflict arising from Mr. M.'s concurrent roles as arbitrator and HSAC member could be cured by resigning from the HSAC. The Claimants disagree. The Chair disagrees as well.\n\n90.\n\nThe Chair is called to determine, based on the facts and arguments before it, whether the challenged arbitrator manifestly lacks or appears to lack one or more of the qualifications in Article 14 (1) of the ICSID Convention. The determination is made considering the proven facts and not alternative but-for scenarios. At the time of this decision, Mr. M. continues to hold two, incompatible, positions.\n\n91.\n\nConsidering the above, the Chair concludes that an objective third party would find an evident or obvious appearance of lack of impartiality of the challenged arbitrator on a reasonable evaluation of the facts in this case.\n\n92.\n\nIn the Proposal, the Claimants submitted an additional argument that Mr. M. failed to notify ICSID and the parties of his appointment with HSAC, breaching his continuing obligation to notify the Centre of any subsequent relationship or circumstance that may put in question his reliability for independent judgment, as required under Arbitration Rule 6(2).\n\n93.\n\nThe US replied indicating that \"nondisclosure cannot by itself make an arbitrator partial or lacking independence: only the facts or circumstances that he or she failed to disclose can do so.\" Given the Chair's determination to uphold the Disqualification Proposal based on Mr. M.'s incompatible concurrent roles, it is unnecessary to decide on the issue of non-disclosure.\n\n94.\n\nIn the circumstances considered above, the Chair finds that there is a manifest appearance that Mr. M. lacks impartiality as required by Article 14 (1) of the ICSID Convention, and the Chair upholds the Disqualification Proposal on this basis.\n\n**(3) Mr. M.'s stance on the interplay between customary international law and US domestic law**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nIn its *third* proposed ground for disqualification, the Claimants draw attention to (a) lectures and articles by Mr. M. while employed by the US Government, in which he allegedly stated that international law should not interfere with the US justice system; and (b) positions adopted by Mr. M. as a federal prosecutor concerning the US Government's use of asset forfeitures, an issue that, according to the Claimants, is central to this arbitration.\n\n96.\n\nThe US replies that (a) it is generally accepted that scholarly expressions of views that do not address specific issues in dispute cannot justify, by themselves, the removal of an arbitrator; and (b) as decided in prior disqualification decisions, Mr. M.'s \"prior professional advocacy is not indicative of any presumption of a lack of independence or impartiality.\"\n\n97.\n\nIn his explanations, Mr. M. stated:\n\na. \"*My service as a Federal prosecutor and as Assistant Attorney General did not involve the issues or individuals that are part of this proceeding. I left the US Department of Justice over a decade ago, and during much of my legal career I was a defense attorney representing individuals who challenged and were adverse to the Justice Department. Thus, as a lawyer I have both supported and contested the positions of the Department.\"* and\n\nb. *\"Regarding the claims that years ago I expressed a generally negative view of international law, the quoted remark is extracted from a 2009 Foreign Affairs article which I authored. The article does not generally oppose application of international law and does not speak to the issues in this arbitration. Indeed, the article endorses bilateral agreements and international law, especially as they relate to \"activities involving the transport of goods, people, or money from one country to another \u2014 such as air travel, cargo transportation, and cross-border financial transactions. International law is particularly appropriate for regulating such activities due to their quintessentially international character.\"*\n\n98.\n\nIn this regard, the Chair notes with approval the *Urbaser v. Argentina* case*,58* where the co-arbitrators deciding a challenge stated, \"[w]hat matters is whether the opinions expressed by [the challenged arbitrator] on the two issues qualified as crucial by Claimants are *specific and clear enough* that a reasonable and informed third party would find that the arbitrator will rely on such opinions without giving proper consideration to the facts, circumstances, and arguments presented by the parties in the proceeding.\" (emphasis added).\n\n*Urbaser S.A. and Consorcio de Aguas Bilbao Bizkaia, Bilbao Biskaia Ur Partzuergoa v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26), Decision on Claimants' Proposal to Disqualify an Arbitrator of August 12, 2010, \u00b644.\n\n99.\n\nThe Chair also refers to the disqualification decision in *Saint-Gobain v Venezuela,59* in which the co-arbitrators deciding the challenge stated that \"[i]t is at the core of the job description of legal counsel\u2014whether acting in private practice, in-house for a company, or in government\u2014that they present the views which are favorable to their instructor and highlight the advantageous facts of their instructor's case. The fact that a lawyer has taken a certain stance in the past does not necessarily mean that he will take the same stance in a future case.\"\n\n*Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Europe v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13), Decision on Claimant's Proposal to Disqualify an Arbitrator of February 27, 2013, \u00b680.\n\n100.\n\nIn the Chair's view, the fact that Mr. M. espoused certain views as an advocate, acting on behalf of a client (in this case, the US Government), does not lead to the conclusion that he would not approach the matters in dispute in this case with an open mind. Likewise, these general statements made by Mr. M. in academic fora would not lead an objective observer to conclude that he is manifestly unreliable to exercise impartial judgement in the present case.\n\n101.\n\nOn the basis of the arguments and evidence before him, the Chair rejects the third ground proposed for the disqualification of Mr. M.\n\n**(4) Allegations that Mr. M. may have obtained confidential information about the Claimants are mere speculation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\n*Fourth*, the Claimants submit that in his private and public capacities, Mr. M. likely had access to confidential information about the Claimants that would affect his views of the issues in dispute. The US portrayed these allegations as speculative and not established by the evidence on the record.\n\n103.\n\nThe Chair agrees with the Respondent and finds that the Claimants' allegations are not supported by the record and thus could not be a basis to disqualify Mr. M.\n\n**(5) Mr. M.'s acquiescence to practices contrary to international law**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe *fifth* ground for disqualification proposed by the Claimants concerns Mr. M.'s alleged acquiescence in legal interpretations that authorized practices contrary to international law and to the benefit of his home country during his tenure at the US Department of Justice.\n\n105.\n\nThe US submits that the Claimants' arguments on issues related to interrogation techniques have no relationship with Mr. M.'s reliability to exercise independence and impartiality. The US accordingly requests that all arguments and evidence supporting these arguments be deleted from the case record.\n\n106.\n\nBefore addressing the merits of this ground for disqualification, the Chair must determine whether the facts and evidence before him are relevant to determine whether Mr. M. manifestly lacks or appears to lack the required reliability to exercise independent and impartial judgement.\n\n107.\n\nThe Chair is not persuaded by the arguments and evidence advanced in connection with this ground. In view of the Chair's decision to uphold the Disqualification Proposal due to Mr. M.'s ongoing advisory relationship with the Respondent, it has become moot to make a determination on this ground.\n\n108.\n\nFinally, as to the Respondent's request that certain portions of the Disqualification Proposal be struck from the record, the Chair notes that pursuant to Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention, he is tasked with deciding the disqualification proposal filed by the Claimants. Any additional determination as to the contents of the record will have to be addressed to the Tribunal once the proceedings are resumed.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n109.\n\nHaving considered all of the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the parties, and for the reasons stated above, the Chair decides as follows:\n\na. Claimants' Proposal to Disqualify arbitrator Mr. M. pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention is upheld, on the basis that his concurrent relationship with the Respondent and service as arbitrator in this case would create the appearance of manifest lack of impartiality;\n\nb. All the other grounds proposed for the disqualification of Mr. M. pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention are rejected."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Objection Under Arbitration Rule 41(5)", "Type": "ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5)", "Date": "2024-01-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Objection Under Arbitration Rule 41(5)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**F requently U sed A bbreviations and A cronyms**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (effective April 10, 2006) |\n| BIT | United States-Ukraine Bilateral Investment Treaty |\n| Claimants or Optima | Optima Ventures LLC, Optima 7171 LLC, and Optima 55 Public Square LLC |\n| US DOJ or DOJ | US Department of Justice |\n| ICSID Convention or Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18, 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| (C-#) | Claimants' Exhibit |\n| (CL-#) | Claimants' Legal Authority |\n| (R-#) | Respondent's Exhibit |\n| (RL-#) | Respondent's Legal Authority |\n| Parties | Claimants and Respondent, collectively |\n| Tr.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the United States-Ukraine Bilateral Investment Treaty (\"**BIT**\") (signed on March 4, 1994, entered into force on November 16, 1996) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force October 14, 1966 (\"**ICSID Convention**\" or \"**Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Optima Ventures LLC, Optima 7171 LLC, and Optima 55 Public Square LLC (\"**Optima**\" or \"**Claimants**\"). The Respondent is the United States of America (\"**United States**,\" \"**US**\" or \"**Respondent**.\"). The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to herein as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' respective representatives and their addresses are listed above.\n\n3.\n\nThe dispute arises out of a series of measures taken by the Respondent with respect to two real estate properties in the United States, which allegedly affected the Claimants' US businesses and resulted in a loss to their investments. The first of these two properties is located at 7505 and 7171 Forest Lane, Dallas, Texas and is referred to herein as the \"**CompuCom Campus**\" or the \"**Texas Property**.\" The second is located at 55 Public Square, Cleveland, Ohio, and is referred to herein as \"**55 Public Square**\" or the \"**Ohio Property**.\"\n\n4.\n\nThis Decision concerns the Respondent's preliminary objections (\"**Preliminary Objections**\") to the Claimants' claims, filed pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn February 8, 2021, **Optima Ventures LLC** and **Optima 7171 LLC**, two companies incorporated in the State of Delaware, indirectly owned and controlled by nationals of Ukraine,1 filed with ICSID a request for arbitration under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, against the United States, concerning the Texas Property. On February 25, 2021, ICSID received a similar request for arbitration from **Optima Ventures LLC** and **Optima 55 Public Square LLC** (also a Delaware incorporated company), concerning the Ohio Property. Collectively, these are referred to as the \"**Requests for Arbitration**.\"\n\nAs further described below, US citizens, Messrs. Mordechai Korf and Uriel Laber, are alleged to hold a 33.335% interest in Optima Ventures LLC. *See infra* \u00b6\u00b6 33-35.\n\n6.\n\nOn March 16, 2021, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered both Requests for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6(1)(a) and 7(a) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of [] Arbitration Proceedings and notified the Parties of the registration of cases ARB/21/11 and ARB/21/12.\n\n7.\n\nOn June 11, 2021, the Parties agreed to discontinue Case No. ARB/21/12 and amend Case No. ARB/21/11 to include Optima Ventures LLC, Optima 7171 LLC and Optima 55 Public Square LLC as Claimants.\n\n8.\n\nOn June 16, 2021, the Secretary-General issued a Procedural Order Taking Note of the Discontinuance of Case No. ARB/21/12 pursuant to Arbitration Rule 43(1).2\n\nAll references to Arbitration Rules in the present decision are to the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings that came into effect on April 10, 2006.\n\n9.\n\nBy communication of June 16, 2021, the Centre took note that the Parties had agreed on the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment, in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 2(1). Pursuant to the Parties' agreement, the Tribunal would be comprised of three members, one appointed by each Party, and the third, the presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. In the absence of such an agreement, the Secretary-General of ICSID would make the appointment, in accordance with the method agreed by the Parties. The Parties also agreed to derogate from nationality restrictions, as permitted by Article 39 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule (1)(3).\n\n10.\n\nIn accordance with the Parties' agreement, the Claimants appointed Professor Jan Paulsson, a national of Bahrain, France, and Sweden, as an Arbitrator. Professor Paulsson accepted his appointment on June 21, 2021. The Respondent in turn appointed Mr. M., a US national, as an Arbitrator. Mr. M. accepted his appointment on July 30, 2021.\n\n11.\n\nBetween July 2021 and April 2022, the Parties, with the assistance of ICSID, endeavored to appoint the presiding arbitrator. As the Parties failed to reach an agreement, on June 23, 2022, the Secretary-General appointed Professor M\u00f3nica Pinto, a national of Argentina, as President of the Tribunal. Professor Pinto accepted her appointment on July 6, 2022.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 6, 2022, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed constituted, and the proceeding had begun on that date.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 15, 2022, the Claimants filed a proposal to disqualify Mr. M. as Arbitrator (\"**Proposal**\").\n\n14.\n\nOn July 16, 2022, the Centre confirmed receipt of the Proposal and informed the Parties that in accordance with Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceeding would be suspended until a decision on the Proposal had been taken.\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural calendar established to address the Proposal, on July 29, 2022, the Respondent filed observations on the Proposal; on August 5, 2022, the challenged Arbitrator furnished explanations in accordance with Arbitration Rule 9(3), and on August 15, 2022, both Parties filed additional observations on the Proposal.\n\n16.\n\nOn August 29, 2022, Professors Pinto and Paulsson informed the Secretary-General that they had failed to reach a decision on the Proposal. In accordance with Article 58 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 9(4), the Proposal would be accordingly decided by the Chair of the Administrative Council.\n\n17.\n\nOn December 20, 2022, the Chair of the Administrative Council upheld the Disqualification Proposal. The proceeding remained suspended pursuant to Arbitration Rule 10(2).\n\n18.\n\nOn January 19, 2023, the Respondent appointed Mr. David Pawlak, a national of the US and Ireland. Mr. Pawlak accepted his appointment on January 23, 2023.\n\n19.\n\nOn January 24, 2023, the Tribunal was reconstituted, comprising Professor Pinto as President of the Tribunal, appointed by the Secretary-General of ICSID; Professor Paulsson, appointed by the Claimants; and Mr. David Pawlak, appointed by the Respondent in accordance with Arbitration Rule 11(1).\n\n20.\n\nOn the same date, the proceeding resumed in accordance with Arbitration Rule 12.\n\n21.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, the Respondent filed its Preliminary Objections.\n\n22.\n\nOn February 28, 2023, the Tribunal held a First Session with the Parties by video conference. During the session, the Parties confirmed that the three Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was also agreed, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect as of April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be The Hague, the Netherlands.\n\n23.\n\nFollowing the First Session, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a joint proposal concerning the procedural timetable for the Parties' pleadings, including with respect to the Respondent's Preliminary Objections.\n\n24.\n\nOn March 11, 2023, unable to reach an agreement, the Parties submitted their respective proposals concerning the procedural timetables for the Parties' pleadings.\n\n25.\n\nOn March 20, 2023, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, concerning various procedural matters (\"**PO No. 1**\").

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n30.\n\nFor purposes of the Preliminary Objections, the Tribunal summarizes the factual background of the dispute, based on the allegations set forth in the Parties' submissions on the Preliminary Objections. Consistent with the applicable legal standard,3 this summary does not, however, constitute any finding of fact or conclusion of law on the part of the Tribunal.\n\n*See infra*, Section VII.\n\n31.\n\nThe case submitted by the Claimants concerns a series of measures adopted by the United States Department of Justice (\"**US DOJ**\" or \"**DOJ**\") and United States courts, allegedly affecting Claimants' real estate property located in the states of Texas and Ohio, on grounds that those assets had been acquired using funds misappropriated from PrivatBank, the largest commercial bank in Ukraine, and that the property was traceable to specified unlawful activity in Ukraine.4\n\nRequest for Arbitration, p. 3 (Feb. 24, 2021) (\"**RfA, Ohio Property**\").\n\n32.\n\nThe Requests for Arbitration address the measures adopted by the United States regarding the Texas and the Ohio Properties, as described below.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants are corporations established in the United States by Ukrainian nationals Messrs. Ihor Kolomoisky and Gennadiy Boholiubov, together with US citizens Messrs. Mordechai Korf and Uriel Laber. Until December 2016, Messrs. Kolomoisky and Boholiubov owned and controlled PrivatBank.5\n\nRfA, Ohio Property, p. 4.\n\n34.\n\nMessrs. Kolomoisky and Boholiubov invested in the US through Optima Ventures, a Delaware limited liability company, in which they hold a 66.67% interest, the remaining 33.335% being in the hands of Messrs. Korf and Laber.6\n\nRfA, Ohio Property, p. 5.\n\n35.\n\nMessrs. Kolomoisky and Boholiubov, together with Messrs. Korf and Laber, are indirect owners of 55 Public Square (the Ohio Property) through Claimant Optima 55 Public Square, a Delaware limited liability company whose sole purpose is ownership of that asset. Optima 55 Public Square is a wholly owned subsidiary of Optima Ventures.7\n\nRfA, Ohio Property, p. 5.\n\n36.\n\nThe same individuals are also indirect owners of CompuCom Campus in Dallas (the Texas Property) through Claimant Optima 7171, a Delaware limited liability company whose sole purpose is ownership of that asset. Optima 7171 is also a wholly owned subsidiary of Optima Ventures.8\n\nRequest for Arbitration, p. 5 (Feb. 8, 2021) (\"**RfA, Texas Property**\").\n\n37.\n\nOn August 6, 2020, the US DOJ filed a complaint for civil forfeiture before the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida regarding the CompuCom Campus (\"**Texas Case**\").9 The complaint alleges, *i.a.*:10\n\nThis is a civil action *in rem* to forfeit assets that facilitated, were involved in, and are traceable to an international conspiracy to launder money embezzled and fraudulently obtained from PrivatBank.\n\nThe misappropriated funds were used to purchase [the Texas Property]...\n\nThe United States seeks forfeiture of the Defendant Asset pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 981(a)(1)(C), because the [Texas Property] is traceable to violations of U.S. law and specified unlawful activity, including violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956, 1957, 2314, and 2315.\n\nThe United States also seeks forfeiture of the [Texas Property] pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(A), because the [Texas Property] was involved in one or more money laundering offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956 and 1957.\n\nThe specified unlawful activity includes fraud by or against a foreign bank (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(c)(7)(B)(iii)); the transportation, receipt, concealment, possession, sale and disposal of misappropriated money in international commerce (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2314 and 2315); and conspiracy to commit those actions.\n\nRfA, Texas Property, p. 3; *United States v.

H. 130.\n\n41.\n\nOn October 5, 2020, Optima Ventures, Optima 7171, as well as Messrs. Korf and Laber, filed claims to contest the forfeiture and requested a jury trial for the Texas Case.14 In their claims, Optima Ventures and Optima 7171 \"reserve[d] any and all defenses and objections, including as to this Court's jurisdiction over the subject of this action, including that such claims should be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the [BIT]\".15\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 40.\n\nVerified Claim of Optima Ventures LLC, \u00b6 7 (Oct. 5, 2020) (Texas Case) (**R-0059**); Verified Claim of Optima 7171 LLC, \u00b6 6 (Oct. 5, 2020) (Texas Case) (**R-0058**).\n\n42.\n\nOn October 12, 2020, the Claimants jointly filed a motion to vacate the *ex parte* order.16\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 40; Claimants' Motion to Vacate *Ex Parte* Restraining Order (Oct. 12, 2020) (Texas Case) (**R-0067**).\n\n43.\n\nOn December 22, 2020, the Claimants notified the Respondent that \"a contract to sell the 55 Public Square property had been executed. One week later, on December 30, 2020, the United States filed a complaint for civil forfeiture against 55 Public Square\" (\"**Ohio Case**\"), containing allegations similar to those presented in the Texas Case.17\n\nRfA, Ohio Property, pp. 3-4; *United States v. Real Property Located at 55 Public Square, Cleveland, Ohio*, Case No. 1:20-cv-25313, Verified Complaint (Dec. 30, 2020) (**C-0011**) (**Complaint, Ohio Case**).\n\n44.\n\nIn its complaint in the Ohio Case, the US \"asserts that the United States may forfeit all of Claimants' interests in 55 Public Square. The United States [] inserted itself into the sale arrangements, and ... conditioned the sale of the property upon the deposit of the net sale proceeds into the account of the United States Marshals Service.\"18\n\nRfA, Ohio Property, p. 4, *citing* Complaint, Ohio Case (**C-0011**).\n\n45.\n\nAlso on December 30, 2020, the DOJ issued a Press Release concerning the Ohio Case, referring to the Texas Case, under a headline reading, \"Justice Department Seeks Forfeiture of [] Commercial Property Purchased with Funds Misappropriated from PrivatBank in Ukraine.19\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 41; Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25; US DOJ Press Release (Dec. 30, 2020) (**C-0012**).\n\n46.\n\nOn January 19, 2021, the Claimants Optima Ventures and Optima 55 Public Square, as well as Messrs. Korf and Laber, filed claims to contest the forfeiture and requested a jury trial for the Ohio Case.20 In presenting their claims, Optima Ventures and Optima 55 Public Square \"reserve[d] any and all objections and defenses, including as to this Court's jurisdiction over the subject of this action, including that such claims should be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the [BIT].\"21\n\nRfA, Ohio Property, \u00b6 87; Verified Claim of Optima 55 Public Square, LLC (Jan. 19, 2021) (Ohio Case) (**R-0069**); Verified Claim of Optima Ventures LLC (Jan. 19, 2021) (Ohio Case) (**R-0070**).\n\nVerified Claim of Optima 55 Public Square (Ohio Case), \u00b6 7 (**R-0069**); Verified Claim of Optima Ventures LLC (Ohio Case), \u00b6 7 (**R-0070**).\n\n47.\n\nOn February 11, 2021, the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted an unopposed motion for an interlocutory sale of the Ohio Property, subject to the terms of a purchase agreement providing for, *i.a.*, the Ohio Property to be sold to an unaffiliated entity \"for the purchase price of $17 million,\" and the satisfaction of various creditors.22\n\nOrder Granting Unopposed Mot. for Interlocutory Sale, \u00b6 5 (Feb. 11, 2021) (Ohio Case) (**R-0073**).\n\n48.\n\nOn February 12, 2021, the sale of 55 Public Square took place pursuant to the order of the District Court and the proceeds of $587,365 were deposited with the US Marshals Service.23\n\nRfA, Ohio Property, p. 4.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that, as of February 2021, the *ex parte* restraining order in the Texas Case remained *sub judice* with no hearing scheduled, the *lis pendens* remained on file in Texas, and the press release remained published on the DOJ's website.24\n\nObservations, \u00b6 26; US DOJ Press Release (Dec. 30, 2020) (**C-0012**); *see also* US DOJ Press Release (Aug. 6, 2020) (concerning, *i.a.*, the Texas Property) (**R-0048**).\n\n50.\n\nIn developments following the submission of the Requests for Arbitration, on May 13, 2021, the US District Court granted a stay in the Texas and Ohio Cases, consistent with the Parties' requests.25 In a subsequent joint status report, both Parties confirmed that they \"continue to agree that a stay is appropriate.\"26\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 44; Omnibus Order, \u00b6 1 (May 13, 2021) (**R-0080**).\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 44; Joint Status Update, \u00b6 5 (Sep. 10, 2021) (**R-0081**).\n\n51.\n\nOn September 22, 2021, the US District Court granted the DOJ's motion for the sale of the Texas Property for $23,250,000, requiring, *i.a.*, that \"the proceeds \u2026 be used to pay debts owed on the Property,\" and the remaining amount be held in escrow pending further order of the Court.27\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 45, 46; Order Granting Unopposed Motion for Interlocutory Sale, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5 (Sep. 22, 2021) (**R-0083**).\n\n**IV. FORFEITURE PROCEEDINGS**\n------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent explains the mechanism of civil forfeiture proceedings as follows.\n\n53.\n\nAs explained in the US House of Representatives Report for draft legislation that eventually became the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, the United States allows for forfeiture of property in part to \"make [] it more difficult for international criminals to use the United States as a haven for the profits from their crimes.\"28 The United States Code, at 18 USC \u00a7 981 *et seq.*, and Supplemental Rule G of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure set out the procedures for federal civil forfeiture cases, as summarized below.29\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 17.\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.\n\n54.\n\nAs an initial step, the DOJ files a forfeiture complaint, verified under penalty of perjury, alleging that a property is subject to civil forfeiture pursuant to statutory authority. The case is filed *in rem*, meaning that it is a case to condemn specific property as proceeds of crime, and not a case against any person. Civil forfeiture does not depend on an underlying criminal indictment or conviction.\n\n55.\n\nWhen seeking a judgment of forfeiture of real property, the government provides notice of the case in multiple ways. Any person or entity with an interest in the property may file a claim, effectively intervening in the case that is otherwise filed with respect to property. That person or entity is termed a \"claimant\" and acts much like a defendant in any civil case.\n\n56.\n\nEither before or after filing a civil forfeiture complaint, the government may seek a pre-trial temporary restraining order to enjoin dissipation of the defendant property. A court may issue such an order, including on an *ex parte* basis, \"to preserve the property, to prevent its removal or encumbrance, or to prevent its use in a criminal offense.\"30\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 20 *citing* Fed. R. Civ. P., Title 28, Appendix, Rule G(7)(a) (**R-0014**).\n\n57.\n\nA court also may approve the sale of an asset pre-trial, called an \"interlocutory sale,\" if, for example, the property is \"at risk of deterioration\" or \"subject to a mortgage or to taxes on which the owner is in default.\"31 Following a sale, funds are held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained by the US pending the outcome of the litigation. Any temporary restraining or interlocutory sale order may be challenged by a claimant, including through a hearing on such motions at the court's discretion, and interlocutory appeal.\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 21 *citing* Fed. R. Civ. P., Title 28, Appendix, Rule G(7)(b) (**R-0014**).\n\n58.\n\nAs in any civil case, the matter then proceeds to discovery, further motions, and a trial, where it is the government's burden to prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence. Any forfeiture judgment is subject to appeal to a federal circuit court panel, and from there, if granted, a full *en banc* circuit court, and to discretionary review by the US Supreme Court.\n\n59.\n\nAny claimant who prevails in a civil forfeiture case is entitled to the return of the claimed property, with interest if the funds were held in escrow, as well as reimbursement by the government of legal fees incurred in litigation.\n\n**V. THE DISPUTE**\n------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimants allege violations of the following BIT provisions:32\n\n\u2022 Article II(3)(a) concerning fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\"), which provides:\n\nInvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\n\n\u2022 Article II(3)(b) concerning arbitrary treatment, which provides:\n\nNeither Party shall ... impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute resolution under Article 3 [*sic*] VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a Party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.\n\n\u2022 Article II(7) concerning effective means of redress, which provides:\n\nEach Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investment, investment agreements, and investment authorizations.\n\n\u2022 Article III concerning expropriation, which provides, in pertinent part:\n\n1. Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization [] except: for public purpose; in a nondiscriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(2) [*sic*]. Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier....\n\nTr. H. 94-95. *See also* RfA, Texas Property, \u00a7 IV; RfA, Ohio Property, \u00a7 IV. For purposes of this Decision, the Tribunal reviews the claims and defenses of the Parties as listed at the Hearing, and associated arguments. *Cf. Emmis International Holding, B.V., et al. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 63 (Mar. 11, 2013) (tribunal limits its review to \"remaining unresolved questions left for its decision\") (**RL-0010**).\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimants further allege that the US has improperly exercised its statutory and judicial authority with respect to foreign property. According to the Claimants, the US conduct thereby violated the international law doctrines of prescriptive jurisdiction and adjudicatory comity, which the US has adopted. The Claimants point to BIT Article VIII, which provides:33\n\nThis Treaty shall not derogate from:\n\n(a) laws and regulations, administrative practices or procedures, or administrative or adjudicatory decisions of either Party;\n\n(b) international legal obligations; or\n\n(c) obligations assumed by either Party, including those contained in an investment agreement or [] authorization, that entitle investments or associated activities to treatment more favorable than that accorded by this Treaty in like situations.\n\n*See generally* Observations, \u00a7 III.B; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 130 *et seq.*; Tr. H. 207-208, 213-214. The Claimants maintain that this position is presented to support the claims for breach of Articles II and III of the BIT, and not as an independent claim. *See* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 56 *et seq.*; Tr. H. 92 *et seq.* Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider BIT Article VIII as a basis for an independent claim or objection. *Cf.*, Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 12.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimants summarize the theory underlying their BIT claims as follows:34\n\nEssentially, Claimants' case is that the civil forfeiture actions brought by the United States invoke its international responsibility because they violate the limits international law places on the United States' ability to prescribe outside of its jurisdiction and because it is a politically motivated conduct that's leveled false allegations targeting high-profile Ukrainian citizen Ihor Kolomoisky.\n\n[...]\n\nThe alleged crime was allegedly committed by Ukrainian citizens violating Ukrainian law with the Ukrainian bank with Ukrainian victims. Despite the crime allegedly being a multi-billion-dollar fraud that necessitated the nationalization of Ukraine's largest private bank, ... the Ukrainian Government has not charged anyone with any crime over these issues....\n\nTr. H. 91:20-92:17. *See also* RfA, Texas Property, Introduction and Factual Background, p. 6, \u00b6 25; RfA, Ohio Property, Introduction and Factual Background, \u00b6 31.\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimants thus posit, *i.a.*, that \"the utilization of the United States judicial system by the [DOJ] to encumber and expropriate Ukrainian investments, based upon alleged criminal conduct and losses within the territory of Ukraine, constitutes unlawful expropriation, insofar as it exceeds the limits of prescriptive jurisdiction and ... prescriptive comity.\"35 The Claimants argue that these principles, according to international law, largely depend on determinations of reasonableness, a threshold that corresponds to the FET standard.36\n\nRfA, Texas Property, \u00b6 71; RfA, Ohio Property, \u00b6 72. *See also* Observations, \u00a7 II.D (*citing*, *i.a.*, Complaint, Texas Case, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 64-73 (**C-0001**)); Rejoinder, \u00b6 132 (*citing*, *i.a.*, Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law \u00a7 431 (1987) (**CL-0182**)).\n\n*See* Observations, \u00b6\u00b6 224-225 (*citing* *Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2001-04, Partial Award, \u00b6 309 (Mar. 17, 2006) (**CL-0123**), 218-219 (*citing* *Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 253 (Jan. 14, 2010) (The minimum standard of treatment under the BIT \"'should not operate as a ceiling, but rather as a floor.'\") (**CL-0072**)).\n\n64.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the result of the US measures (the forfeiture actions, press release, *lis pendens*, and *ex parte* order) is that their assets were frozen and rendered unusable, resulting in violations of Articles II(3)(a), II(3)(b), II(7), and III of the BIT.37 The Claimants assert that the US thereby removed \"Claimants' ability to manage their Investment,\" and forced \"a quick sale of the properties\" as \"the only viable path forward.\"38\n\nTr. H. 94-95; *see also supra*, \u00b6 60.\n\nTr. H. 130:3-17, 202:2-19.\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that \"the *ex parte* procedures employed by the United States to seize control of the CompuCom Campus and mandate the transfer of the sale proceeds to the United States Marshals Service constitutes violation of both customary international law's minimum standards and due process and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\" in breach of Articles II(3) and III(1) of the BIT.39\n\nRfA, Texas Property, \u00b6\u00b6 78, 84.\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal:\n\n(1) Declare that the US breached its obligations under the US-Ukraine BIT;\n\n(2) Order the US to pay the Claimants compensation for damages, of approximately $23,250,000 (Texas Property) and $587,365.74 (Ohio Property);\n\n(3) Order the US to pay interest on all amounts awarded, from the date of the Award until full payment of the Award;\n\n(4) Award such other and further relief as it deems appropriate.40\n\nRfA, Texas Property, \u00b6 105; RfA, Ohio Property, \u00b6 94.\n\n**VI. PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nIn its Preliminary Objections, the Respondent contends that, even if the facts as pled by the Claimants were true (which the US denies), the Claimants' claims are without foundation.41 The US lists three principal objections, maintaining that the Claimants cannot establish any of their BIT claims on the existing factual record as a matter of law.42 Therefore, the US concludes, the claims manifestly lack legal merit pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(5).43\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 15.\n\nTr. H. 86-87. The US alternatively had suggested a \"fourth\" objection by separating its arguments concerning comity from those concerning prescriptive jurisdiction. Tr. H. 12-13. However, the Tribunal's Analysis as set forth in Section VIII below does not turn on any such characterizations.\n\n*See generally* Tr. H. 10 *et seq.*\n\n68.\n\nEach of the Preliminary Objections is summarized briefly in the subsections that follow.\n\n**VI.1 First Objection**\n------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent's First Objection is that, prior to submitting this dispute to arbitration, Claimants failed to abide by the six-month cooling-off, or waiting period contained in Article VI of the BIT, which provides, in pertinent part:\n\n1. \"[A]n investment dispute is a dispute \u2026 arising out of or relating to \u2026 (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred ... by this [BIT] with respect to an investment.\"\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties ... should initially seek a resolution through consultation.... If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the ... Party to the dispute; or\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed ... procedures; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company [] may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration....\n\n70.\n\nAccording to the US, the earliest that a dispute under the BIT could have arisen with respect to the Texas Case was October 5, 2020, when the Claimants contested the forfeiture case in US District Court and reserved an objection pursuant to the BIT.44 The Claimants filed their claims only four months from that date, and a mere 36 days after their similar US District Court filing in the Ohio Case on January 19, 2021, which is the earliest date, the US maintains, that a dispute could have arisen with respect to that case.45\n\n*See* Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 57. *See also supra*, \u00b6 41.\n\n*See* Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 61. *See also supra*, \u00b6 46.\n\n71.\n\nThe US states that, in both cases, the Claimants filed their Requests for Arbitration without attempting to seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation,46 and that, because it was not aware of the existence of a BIT dispute, the US could not seek its resolution.47\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 11.\n\nTr. H. 33:1-3.\n\n72.\n\nThe US refers to, *i.a.*, *Murphy v. Ecuador*, in which the tribunal held that a dispute under the BIT applicable in that case could arise only once the claimant had alleged and notified Ecuador of a treaty breach, and that the BIT's waiting period ran from that date.48\n\nRespondent's Objections, \u00b6 56, *citing* *Murphy Exploration and Production Co. Int'l v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 103 (Dec. 15, 2010) (**RL-0017**).\n\n73.\n\nThe US maintains that the waiting period of Article VI is a mandatory and jurisdictional requirement that bears on the consent to arbitrate disputes under the BIT. As such, it may not be circumvented due to, *e.g.*, a particular set of facts of a given case.49\n\n*See generally* Preliminary Objections, \u00a7 IV.A.\n\n74.\n\nIn response, the Claimants argue that, under the terms of Article VI, an arbitration may be filed six months from the date on which a dispute arises, which occurs upon \"'an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by'\" the BIT, excluding any requirement of formal notice to the respondent.50 The Claimants add that, in any event, the US knew or should have known that the Claimants would oppose the civil forfeiture proceedings, and therefore, the US had constructive notice of the dispute with the Claimants.51\n\n*See generally* Tr. H. 111 *et seq.*; Rejoinder, \u00b6 14; Observations, \u00b6 86.\n\nTr. H. 115:13-116:9.\n\n75.\n\nTo support their position, which they contend is consistent with the BIT's plain language, the Claimants rely on the *Link-Trading v. Moldova* tribunal's application of an allegedly similar provision to find that the dispute in question arose on the date of the implementation of the law that formed the basis of the claimant's claims under the applicable BIT.52\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 95 *et seq.*, *citing* *Link-Trading Joint Stock Co. v. Moldova Dep't of Customs Control*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8.6 (Feb. 16, 2001) (**CL-0019**).\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that, because of a clear nexus between the Requests for Arbitration, and the evident reluctance of the US to resolve the BIT claims, the Claimants did not need to wait six months from the date a dispute arose with respect to the Ohio Property to file their second Request for Arbitration, pertaining to the Ohio Case.53\n\nObservations, \u00b6 106.\n\n77.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants submit that the MFN provision in the BIT authorizes them to import shorter waiting periods from other US BITs54 (which the Respondent disputes). The Claimants also allege that the waiting period is not jurisdictional and may be set aside where the Respondent shows no interest in resolving the dispute.55\n\nTr. H. 117:12-18 (*citing* BIT, Article II(1)).\n\nTr. H. 123:14-125:14.\n\n**VI.2 Second Objection**\n-------------------------\n\n78.\n\nFor its Second Objection, the US generally argues that the Claimants' claims are inchoate because there has been no final action by the US District Court in the underlying civil forfeiture proceedings with respect to the Texas and Ohio Properties. According to the US, it is well-established that judicial finality is a substantive element of an international delict with respect to judicial measures. Thus, the US maintains that the Claimants' claims are grossly premature and unripe and cannot constitute a breach of Article II or III of the BIT as a matter of law.56\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 13.\n\n79.\n\nThe US further submits that the Claimants failed to use the available and adequate remedies (as noted above in Section IV) to contest the civil forfeiture proceedings.57 The US adds that Claimants even requested a stay of the civil forfeiture proceedings in order to bring this Arbitration.58 There can be no permanent or irreversible taking of any asset when the impugned actions are inchoate, the US contends.59\n\n*See*, *e.g.*, Tr. H. 51:16-52:22 (*citing* *Generation Ukraine, Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award, \u00b6 20.30 (Sep. 16, 2003) (\"'an international tribunal may deem that the failure to seek redress from national authorities disqualifies the international claim, not because there is a requirement of *exhaustion* of local remedies, but because the very reality of conduct tantamount to [a treaty breach] is doubtful in the absence of a *reasonable* \u2013 not necessarily exhaustive \u2013 effort by the investor to obtain correction'\") (**RL-0032**)).\n\nTr. H. 12:6-19, 24:5-11.\n\nTr. H. 65:12-13, 68:12-14.\n\n80.\n\nThe US additionally posits that judicial acts can only breach the BIT if there has been a denial of justice,60 which does not occur where claims are inchoate.61 The US further contends that Claimants' effective means claim under BIT Article II(7) cannot be established on the existing record and, moreover, is subsumed in the denial of justice claim.62\n\nTr. H. 50:12-18.\n\nTr. H. 51:3-5.\n\n*See generally* Tr. H. 57 *et seq.*\n\n81.\n\nOn their side, the Claimants submit that they have made a \"colorable\" claim of breach of the BIT, which is all that is required for the Tribunal to dismiss the Preliminary Objections.63 The Claimants allege that the civil forfeiture proceedings and associated circumstances (such as the press release) resulted in a diminution in the value of the Texas and Ohio Properties that is sufficiently permanent and significant to support a finding of breach of Articles II and III of the BIT.64\n\n*See generally* Tr. H. 126 *et seq.*\n\nTr. H. 134:8-135:4.\n\n82.\n\nFor example, the Claimants state that a taking may be compensable pursuant to Article III of the BIT where, *i.a.*, the effect of the measures concerned has had a significant and lasting effect on the investment at issue, regardless of whether a court has issued a final judgment formalizing the taking.65 According to the Claimants, this standard is met by the US measures, which \"froze\" the Texas and Ohio Properties and any associated assets.66\n\nTr. H. 126:19-133:6.\n\nTr. H. 107:10-15; 130:3-131:3; 202:12-19.\n\n83.\n\nWith respect to their claim concerning arbitrary treatment, the Claimants point to the language of Article II(3)(b) that \"a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a Party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts ... of a Party[,]\" relying on, *i.a.*, the interpretation of this provision in *Lemire v. Ukraine*.67\n\nTr. H. 136:12-139:22 (*citing Lemire*, Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, \u00b6 277 (whether or not a Party \"has exercised ... the right to judicial review ... is irrelevant in an investment arbitration deciding whether the measure is arbitrary or discriminatory\") (**CL-0072**)).\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that they have not made a denial of justice claim (so as to implicate a requirement of exhaustion of local remedies).68 On the other hand, the Claimants assert an effective means claim pursuant to BIT Article II(7) on the grounds that US courts cannot provide a suitable remedy,69 which situation this Tribunal is able to address.70\n\nTr. H. 141:12-13.\n\nTr. H. 148:5-13 & 149:18-20.\n\nTr. H. 150:3-4.\n\n**VI.3 Third Objection**\n------------------------\n\n85.\n\nIn its Third Objection, the US argues that the principles of comity and prescriptive jurisdiction cannot bar the US from pursuing the measures complained of in this case.71 The US asserts that adjudicatory comity is an affirmative defense in US court (not a claim), which the Claimants had raised prior to the issuance of the stay in the Texas and Ohio Cases. The lack of a decision on this issue in US Court, according to the US, prevents the Claimants from relying on the doctrine of adjudicatory comity in this BIT\u00a0case.\n\n*See generally* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 75 *et seq.*; Tr. H. 80:6-81:18.\n\n86.\n\nThe US further contends that the doctrine is merely discretionary (allowing a court to decline to hear a case being adjudicated in a foreign court) and therefore cannot support a finding of a violation of a treaty provision such as BIT Article II or III. The US adds its position that US courts will not apply this doctrine when \"the Executive Branch has already made a determination to proceed with the case despite any alleged foreign policy implications.\"72\n\nReply, \u00b6 78 (*citing United States v. Baker Hughes Inc*., 731 F. Supp. 3, 6 (D.D.C. 1990) (**R-0108**)).\n\n87.\n\nThe US considers that the Claimants' prescriptive jurisdiction argument is frivolous because, according to the US, it does not challenge any US law as such.73 Further, the US submits that Article II(3)(a) concerning FET is not a conduit for enforcing every rule of international law but rather addresses only breaches of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, which does not include putative violations of the supposed customary international law rules on prescriptive jurisdiction.74\n\n*See generally* Tr. H. 75 *et seq*.\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 14.\n\n88.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a presumption against extraterritoriality \u2014 pursuant to which the legislation of the US Congress is presumed to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the US \u2014 is inapplicable in the present case75 because the Congress clearly specified that the federal money laundering statutes apply to activities undertaken outside the US.76\n\nReply, \u00b6 72.\n\nReply, \u00b6 73, 74.\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent adds its position that the US did not engage in any actions inconsistent with the municipal law principles of adjudicatory comity or prescriptive jurisdiction.77\n\nReply, \u00b6 71. The Claimants' arguments as regards adjudicatory comity and prescriptive jurisdiction are summarized above at paragraphs 61-63.\n\n**VII. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD**\n----------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nArbitration Rule 41(5) provides:\n\nUnless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.\n\n91.\n\nThe rationale behind Arbitration Rule 41(5) is to allow for the early dismissal of claims that manifestly lack legal merit, to avoid the need for the parties to expend time and resources arbitrating unmeritorious claims.78 Rule 41(5) objections may pertain either to jurisdiction or the merits of a dispute.79 They should be legal \u2013 not factual \u2013 objections.80\n\n*See* ICSID, *Manifest Lack of Legal Merit - ICSID Convention Arbitration* (**RL-0004**); Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 50.\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. Jordan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 97 (May 12, 2008) (\"the adjective 'legal' in Rule 41(5) is clearly used in [contrast] to 'factual' given [its] drafting genesis\") (**RL-0008**).\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, in light of other ICSID Convention provisions like Articles 36(3) \u2013 permitting the Secretary-General not to register requests for arbitration dealing with disputes that are *manifestly* outside the jurisdiction of the Centre \u2013 and 52(1)(b) \u2013 which includes as a ground for annulment that the tribunal has *manifestly* exceeded its powers \u2013 and applicable cases, the word \"manifestly\" as used in Rule 41(5) points to something obvious, clear or self-evident, that is discernable without the need for an elaborate analysis.81\n\nICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment*, \u00b6 83 (May 5, 2016). *See also*, *e.g.*, *Mainstream Renewable Power, Ltd. et al. v. Germany*, ICSID Case No. ARB/21/26, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 86 (Jan. 18, 2022) (**CL-0002**)).\n\n93.\n\nThe Parties appear to agree with this general principle, as evidenced by their citations to cases in which the principle was endorsed, such as *Trans-Global v. Jordan*,82 *PNG v. Papua New Guinea*,83 and *Mainstream v. Germany*.84 As stated by the *Mainstream* tribunal \u2013 following the *Trans-Global* tribunal \u2013 the respondent must establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and dispatch. Thus, the exercise of the tribunal in finding a \"manifest\" lack of legal merit, even if complicated, or multifaceted, in light of the arguments of the parties and the circumstances of the case, ultimately should never be difficult.85\n\n*Trans-Global*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 88, 92 (**RL-0008**) (*cited in* Preliminary Objections*, \u00b6* 52).\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v. Papua New Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 88 (Oct. 28, 2014) (**CL-0001**) (*cited in* Observations *\u00b6\u00b6* 1-6, 205).\n\n*Mainstream*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 81-82 (**CL-0002**) (*cited in* Observations \u00b6\u00b6 3-4).\n\n*Mainstream*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 82 (**CL-0002**); *Trans-Global*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 88 (**RL-0008**).\n\n94.\n\nAs to the scope of the phrase \"without legal merit\", the Respondent posits that if the facts asserted fail to trigger a legal claim, then the Rule 41(5)\u00a0standard is satisfied.86 The Claimants maintain that a colorable legal claim, or a \"tenable arguable case\" cannot be summarily dismissed under Rule 41(5) due to a lack of certainty that the claim is meritless.87\n\nPreliminary Objections, \u00b6 52 (*citing* *Almasryia for Operating & Maintaining Touristic Construction Co., LLC v. Kuwait*, ICSID Case No. ARB/18/2, Rule 41(5) Decision,\u00a0\u00b6 33 (Nov. 1, 2019)\u00a0(**RL-0009**); *Emmis*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 26 (**RL-0010**)).\n\nObservations, \u00b6 4 (citing *PNG*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 88, 89 (**CL-0001**); Mainstream, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 83, 84 (**CL-0002**); MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas Co. Plc v. Croatia, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/32, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 46 (Dec. 2, 2014) (**CL-0004**)).\n\n95.\n\nAccordingly, in line with the text of Rule 41(5), the positions of the Parties, and applicable sources as cited herein, the Tribunal considers that, as a general matter, a claim that is tenable, arguable, colorable, or debatable, on the facts asserted,88 should survive a Rule 41(5) objection. As explained by the *Trans-Global* tribunal, such an arguable case generally will be said to exist where the issues concerned are reasonably susceptible to legal argument.89\n\nThis principle is consistent with the approach of prior tribunals, which have expressed that, so long as the facts presented are reasonably plausible to the tribunal, they should be accepted for purposes of determining whether the claim concerned is manifestly lacking in legal merit at the Rule 41(5) stage. *See*, *e.g.*, *Trans-Global*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 105 (\"although the tribunal need not accept at face value any factual allegation which the tribunal regards as (manifestly) incredible, frivolous, vexatious or inaccurate or made in bad faith\", \"a tribunal should [not] otherwise weigh the credibility or plausibility of a disputed factual allegation\") (**CL-0003/RL-0008**); *Mainstream*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 95, 99 (Rule 41(5) largely requires the tribunal to accept the facts as pled) (**CL-0002**). This principle is also consistent with the Parties' positions in this case, which generally concern legal arguments as applied to the facts as alleged by Claimants. *See*, *e.g.*, *supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 67, 94 (US position); Tr. H. 125 *et seq.* (Optima position).\n\n*See* *Trans-Global,* Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 84, 90 (**CL-0003**/**RL-0008**). *See also*, *e.g.*, *Eskosol S.p.A. in Liquidazione v. Italy*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 118 *et seq.* (March 20, 2017) (question not subject to \"settled jurisprudence\" on a disputed issue of fact is unsuitable for dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(5)) (**CL-0005**); *PNG*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 93 *et seq.* (\"disputed, and [] complex, legal and factual issues [] cannot properly be resolved within the expedited Rule 41(5) procedure\") (**CL-0001**).\n\n96.\n\nAs articulated in *PNG*, \"Rule 41(5) is not intended to resolve novel, difficult or disputed legal issues, but instead only to apply undisputed or genuinely indisputable rules of law to uncontested facts.\"90 As stated in *Mainstream*, to succeed under Rule 41(5), a \"Respondent must be able to show the Tribunal that the claim was lost before it left the start line.\"91\n\n*PNG*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 89 (**CL-0001**).\n\n*Mainstream*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 96 (**CL-0002**).\n\n97.\n\nThis Tribunal, accordingly, undertakes its analysis in light of the foregoing principles, in view of the arguments of the Parties and the record of the case, as summarized above.\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Preliminary Objection on February 14, 2023. As indicated above,92 that filing took place within 30 days from the re-constitution of the Tribunal. Thus, the Preliminary Objections have been timely filed, and it is undisputed that the Parties have not agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections. Therefore, these requirements of Rule 41(5) have been met.\n\n*See generally supra*, \u00a7 II.\n\n99.\n\nAfter careful analysis and deliberation, although the Respondent has presented several significant issues which the Claimants will have to address in due course, the Tribunal finds that the Preliminary Objections do not meet the required threshold for summary dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(5). In rendering this Decision, the Tribunal shares the view of the *Trans-Global* tribunal that, to avoid any possible misconception that it has prejudged the merits of the claims (which is not the case), the less it says here, the better.93\n\n*Trans-Global*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 107 (**CL-0003**/**RL-0008**).\n\n100.\n\nAs indicated in the text of Rule 41(5)c, this Decision is without prejudice to any positions or arguments of the Parties that may be pursued outside of the Rule 41(5) procedure.94\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6 90 (\"The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to [object] pursuant to paragraph (1) [jurisdictional objections] or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.\").\n\n**VIII.1 First Objection**\n--------------------------\n\n101.\n\nAs explained above in Section VI.1, the First Objection points to the waiting period provided for in the BIT, which, in the Respondent's contention, was not honored by the Claimants with the result that this Tribunal is deprived of jurisdiction in this case.\n\n102.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the Respondent's objection may not be upheld under Rule 41(5). Questions concerning the issue of precisely when a BIT\u00a0\"dispute\" arose in connection with the Texas and Ohio Cases involve the weighing of factual allegations and a legal interpretation of BIT provisions and other sources invoked by the Parties. Such issues are not suitable for resolution pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(5), which is meant only for the application of \"genuinely indisputable rules of law to uncontested facts.\"95\n\n*PNG*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 89 (**CL-0001**).\n\n103.\n\nFurther, the determination of nature of the waiting period set forth in Article VI of the BIT as mandatory and jurisdictional (or not), and whether it may be bypassed by virtue of the application of the BIT's MFN provision, requires a review of extensive Party arguments and sources on those subjects, and the resolution of unsettled or debatable issues of law, which in the circumstances of this case the US has not established would be appropriate in the context of a proceeding under Arbitration Rule 41(5).96\n\n*See generally supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 91-96.\n\n104.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the First Objection should be dismissed.\n\n**VIII.2 Second Objection**\n---------------------------\n\n105.\n\nAs explained above in Section VI.2, the Second Objection raises a series of contested issues regarding the substantive elements of claims arising under Articles II and III of the BIT. Whereas the US argues that the claims are \"inchoate\" and therefore not actionable under the BIT, the Claimants maintain that their BIT claims are ripe for resolution.\n\n106.\n\nThese arguments include issues concerning the extent to which finality or exhaustion of remedies is required to establish claims of breach with respect to conduct involving judicial measures, what remedies are available to a claimant in a forfeiture proceeding under US law, and the magnitude and duration of loss that is required to establish an expropriation.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal's resolution of such issues, in turn, requires the complex interpretation and application of disputed treaty provisions,97 including a legal determination of what conduct constitutes arbitrary treatment under Article II(3)(b) and the denial of effective means of redress under Article II(7) in light of the statutory framework concerning US forfeiture proceedings, and the content of the FET standard under Article II(3)(a).\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\n108.\n\nThe claims also implicate a determination of contested facts,98 such as the extent of the factual predicate for the forfeiture proceedings, the extent to which Claimants did, or were entitled to, seek redress under applicable United States law, and the cause and extent of the Claimants' loss, if any, with respect to the Texas and Ohio Properties.\n\nAs described in Section VI.2 above.\n\n109.\n\nThe resolution of such issues is not obvious, or self-evident from the existing Arbitration record, but rather requires further submissions, argument, and analysis of unsettled or debatable, and complex, matters of law and contested facts.99 Indeed, the Parties' positions reveal that these issues are reasonably susceptible to argument, thus disqualifying Claimants' claims arising under Articles II and III of the BIT from being dismissed under Rule 41(5).100\n\n*See generally supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 91-96.\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6 95.\n\n110.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the Second Objection should be dismissed.\n\n**VIII.3 Third Objection**\n--------------------------\n\n99.\n\nAs described above in Section VI.3 (and paragraphsXXXX 61-63), the Third Objection concerns the principles of prescriptive jurisdiction and adjudicatory comity as matters of domestic and international law, calling for an interpretation of a variety of sources of law, as well as a review of the factual basis for the US forfeiture proceedings and related measures, and, potentially, legislative and judicial measures and associated facts in Ukraine.\n\n100.\n\nThese questions cannot be dispatched easily as required by the criteria under Rule 41(5).101 Rather, in the words of the *PNG* tribunal, they involve, \"novel, difficult [and] disputed legal issues,\"102 as well as contested facts. Indeed, the issues raised do not appear to have been addressed previously by an ICSID tribunal and may require the resolution of complex matters of first impression, which cannot properly be resolved in a Rule 41(5) procedure.103\n\n*See supra,* \u00b6 93*.*\n\n*PNG*, Rule 41(5) Decision, \u00b6 89 (**CL-0001**).\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\n101.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Third Objection should be dismissed.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n111.\n\nPursuant to Article 62(1) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47 of the Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal has discretionary power in its award to decide the amount and allocation of legal and arbitration costs recoverable by one party against the other party.\n\n112.\n\nAt this stage, the Tribunal takes note of the Parties' positions and requests with respect to costs and reserves its assessment as to costs for a later phase of the Arbitration.\n\n**X. OPERATIVE PART**\n---------------------\n\n113.\n\nIn light of the above considerations and for the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides:\n\n(1) The Respondent's Preliminary Objections under Rule 41(5)\u00a0are hereby dismissed.\n\n(2) The issue of costs is reserved for a later stage of the proceeding."}]}
