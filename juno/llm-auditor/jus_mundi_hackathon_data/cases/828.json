FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n----------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present arbitration was initiated on January 15, 1981 when Amco Asia Corporation (hereinafter called \"Amco Asia\"). Pan American Development Limited (hereinafter called \"Pan American\") and PT Amco Indonesia (hereinafter called \u201fPT Amco\"). collectively the Claimants, filed with the Secretary-General, icsid, a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Indonesia (\"the Respondent\"). Paragraph 1 of said Request states the following:\n\nAMCO Asia Corporation. Pan American Development Limited and PT Amco hereby request arbitration of a legal dispute with the Republic of Indonesia arising directly out of their hotel investment in Indonesia in 1968. The investment was authorized by the Republic for a period of 30 years but in 1980 the Republic seized the investment in an armed, military action and cancelled the investment licence. The parties dispute the right of the Republic to seize the investment and cancel the licence.\n\nThe Claimants requested that:\n\ndamages be awarded against the Republic in the amount of not less than US $9,000,000. together with interest from March 31. 1980. costs and disbursements of this arbitration, counsel fees, and such other and further relief as the Centre shall deem just.\n\n2.\n\nAfter the Tribunal was composed, the Respondent filed on June 21. 1982. a \"Proposal... for disqualification of an arbitrator\". In opposition to this proposal. Claimants filed a Memorandum, which was handed to the Tribunal and to the Respondent at the first session of the Tribunal, which was held in Washington. DC. on June 23 and 24, 1982.\n\nDuring this session, the two unchallenged arbitrators heard, according to Article 9 of the icsid Rules on Arbitration, oral arguments on the proposal as well as a statement of the challenged arbitrator, and rejected the proposal by a decision of June 24. 1982.\n\n3.\n\nFollowing said decision and on the same day. Claimants filed with the Tribunal a \"Statement of Facts and Law\", dated June 21. 1982. in support of the Request for Arbitration and concluding that they \"should be awarded compensation of not less than US $12,494,000 together with interest and cost.\"\n\nFollowing an order of the Tribunal, Respondent filed its CounterMemorial (hereinafter \"CM\") on December 30. 1982. which besides opposing the merits of the claims, raises objections to jurisdiction which are the subject-matter of this award.\n\nOn January 21, 1983, the Tribunal, in accordance with Rule 41(3). suspended further proceedings on the merits of the claims made by the Claimants and permitted the Claimants thirty (30) days, later extended by a further 7 days, to file any written observations they wished to make on the issues of jurisdiction raised by the Respondent.\n\nClaimants, on February 28, 1983. filed a Reply to the Counter-Memorial, which contained, among other things, certain observations on the jurisdictional questions put forward by the Respondent.\n\nAfter considering the representations of counsel to the Parties, the Tribunal in a decision (actually Procedural Order No. 3) of 1 April 1983. ordered that \"legal objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent\" were to be dealt with as a preliminary matter, and that the Respondent's contentions relating to jurisdiction which \"involve examination of facts bymeans of testimonies\" were to be joined to the further examination, if any. by the Tribunal of the merits of the claims. At the same time Respondent was given until April 25, 1983, to file its Observations with regard to its objections to jurisdiction and the Claimants were granted until May 23, 1983, to file a Rejoinder.\n\nThe Respondent's Observation on Jurisdiction and the Claimant's Rejoinder thereto were duly filed and the hearings for the oral arguments on the preliminary legal jurisdictional matters were held in Paris on June 28-29, 1983.\n\nII. DISCUSSION\n--------------\n\n4.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, dated December 30, 1982 the Respondent presented the following submissions concerning the matter of jurisdiction (pages 106-108):\n\nMay it please the Tribunal\n\n1. *On the principal objections to jurisdiction:*\n\nTo adjudge and declare\n\n(a) That the Centre and this Tribunal are without jurisdiction to entertain or decide any of the claims advanced by Amco Asia in claimants' Request for Arbitration and Memorial, Indonesia not having consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre in respect of any dispute between Indonesia and Amco Asia:\n\n(b) That the Centre and this Tribunal are without jurisdiction to entertain or decide any of the claims advanced by Pan American in claimants' Request for Arbitration and Memorial. Indonesia not having consented to the jurisdiction of the Centre in respect of any dispute between Indonesia and Pan American;\n\n(c) Whether the Centre and this Tribunal have jurisdiction to entertain or decide any of the claims advanced by PT Amco in claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration and Memorial, Indonesia not having effectively consented that PT Amco. a national of the Republic, be treated as a United States national for purposes of the Convention.\n\n2. *On the alternative objection to jurisdiction:*\n\nIf this Tribunal should adjudge and declare that the Centre and this Tribunal have jurisdiction in respect of PT Amco. to adjudge and declare that the Centre and this Tribunal are without jurisdiction to entertain or decide any of the claims of PT Amco relating to the alleged hotel \"seizure\" and termination of the lease agreements with PT Wisma. the latter not being a Contracting State or an agency thereof designated to the Centre by such State, and disputes between private parties being outside the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n3. *On the alternative objection to admissibility:*\n\nIf this Tribunal should reject the objection to jurisdiction formulated in 2 above on the ground that PT Wisma and Indonesia are one and the same, to adjudge and declare that PT Amco has waived and is precluded from invoking consent to jurisdiction of the Centre in respect of its claims relating to the alleged hotel \"seizure\" and termination of the lease agreements with PT Wisma because of the decision on these matters by the Jakarta Court, and further to adjudge and declare that PT Amco's claims relating to the termination of the lease agreements therefore are inadmissible.\n\n5.\n\nIn their Reply to Indonesia\u2019s Counter-Memorial, dated 28 February 1983, the Claimants presented the following conclusions, relating to the same matter (page 123):\n\n1. Indonesia has twice consented in writing to ICSID arbitration of Claimants' investment dispute - once when it approved Claimants\u2019 Investment Application containing an icsid arbitration clause, and once again when it promulgated an investment promotion literature guaranteeing arbitration of investment disputes such as this one.\n\n2. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction extends to all of Indonesia's alleged wrongful actions including the seizure of the Hotel by its Army, the revocation of the investment licence by its Investment Board and the rescission of the Lease and Management Contract by its courts, because such actions deprived Claimants of their investment without compensation.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent concluded as follows its Observations on Jurisdiction, dated April 25. 1983:\n\nFor the reasons stated above and in the Counter-Memorial, Indonesia renews its submissions (CM at 106-108) regarding the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nFinally, the Conclusion of Claimant's Rejoinder to Indonesia's Observations on Jurisdiction reads as follows:\n\nFor the reasons stated in Claimant's Reply and Rejoinder, the Tribunal should find that Indonesia has consented in writing to ICSID arbitration with each Claimant, and that the Tribunal's jurisdiction extends to all of the Claimant's causes of action.\n\n8.\n\nIt thus appears that to decide on the Respondent\u2019s Objections to jurisdiction - which it is undoubtedly and uncontestedly competent to do (Convention. Article 41(1)), notwithstanding the fact that since he registered the request, the Secretary-General had not found that the dispute was \"manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre\" (Convention. Article 36(3)) - the Tribunal has to consider three sets of issues, namely:\n\n\u2014 Has the Tribunal jurisdiction over the parties to the dispute? (a)\n\n\u2014 Has the Tribunal jurisdiction in respect of the matters in dispute, or of some or none of them? (b)\n\n\u2014 Are the Claimants estopped from or did they waive the right to invoke this Tribunal's jurisdiction.(c)\n\nA. *Jurisdiction over the Parties*\n----------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThese issues are raised by the Respondent in respect to the three Claimants, namely Amco Asia, Pan American and PT Amco. They will be dealt with separately in respect of each of the Claimants, starting however with PT Amco, continuing with Amco Asia and finishing with Pan American (AA).\n\nOn the other hand. Indonesia alleges that it has not rightly been designated as Respondent, since according to it, the claims put forward by the Claimants do not concern it, but PT Wisma. Accordingly, the Tribunal will examine whether this objection amounts to a denial of its jurisdiction over the true Respondent in the case, and if so, will decide on it (AB).\n\nAA. *Jurisdiction over the Claimants*\n-------------------------------------\n\na) *PT Amco*\n------------\n\n10.\n\nIt is stated in Article I of the above mentioned \"Application to establish PT Amco Indonesia\", which has been agreed to by Indonesia through the documents already analysed, that:\n\n... the applicant puts forward an application to establish a foreign business in Indonesia (hereafter referred to as the business). The name of the business which will be established is PT Amco Indonesia. The BUSINESS will be domiciled in Indonesia and established within a period of thirty (30) days.\n\nThen. Article IX of the said Application provides as follows:\n\nIf at a later date there is a disagreement and dispute between the business and the government, this disagreement will be put before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, in which body the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the United States are members. All the decisions made by the Convention mentioned above will bind the sides which are in disagreement and dispute.\n\nIt is to be noted here that these quotations are drawn from the translation of the Application filed by the Claimants with their Request for Arbitration (Exh. A/t). In said translation, the word \u201fbusiness\" corresponds to the word *\"perusahaan\"* in the Indonesian original of the Application (Exh. A). Discussions took place and a controversy arose as to the accurate translation of that word, the Respondent, contending that it corresponds in English to \"company\" rather than to \"business\". This controversy could possibly be relevant, with all reservations, to the determination of the Tribunal's jurisdiction in respect of Amco Asia; but as far as PT Amco is concerned, it has no bearing, since Article I of the Application designates expressly PT Amco as the \u201f *perusahaan\"* to be established, and Article IX submits to ICSID arbitration the disputes between the *\"perusahaan\"* and the Government.\n\n11.\n\nNot denying this express submission of disputes to ICSID arbitration, to which PT Amco and the Government agreed, the Respondent states that \u201fthe Tribunal must... determine if it has jurisdiction over PT Amco\" (CM 15); then, in its \"Observations\" (at 11) that:\n\nThe jurisdictional limitations prescribed by the Convention, in particular as elaborated by the *Holiday Inns* case, raise substantial questions with respect to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over PT Amco. In order to resolve this doubt Indonesia therefore has requested that the Tribunal determine whether article 9 of the investment application constitutes a valid and effective consent by Indonesia to arbitration treating one of its own nationals. PT Amco. as a United States national for purposes of the Convention.\n\n12.\n\nIn fact, taking into account its elaboration during the oral argument presented by counsel to the Respondent at the hearings of June 28 and 29, 1983, the thus expressed \"doubt\" is close to a denial of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over PT Amco.\n\nBe that as it may, the reasons of the Respondent's \u201fdoubt\" or denial may be fairly summarized as follows:\n\n(i) The consent given by a sovereign State to an arbitration convention amounting to a limitation of its sovereignty is to be construed restrictively: this alleged principle of interpretation, in spite of it being more directly referred to in respect of the denied jurisdiction over Amco Asia and Pan American is indeed put forward as having a general application (Observations, at 2).\n\n(ii) PT Amco being, in the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention a \"juridical person... which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute\" at the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to arbitration, the jurisdiction of the Centre could have been extended over it provided that \"because of foreign control, the parties have agreed (it) should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purpose of the Convention\" (Article 25(2)(b), infine): now, Article IX of the Application does not contain such an express agreement to treat PT Amco as a national of another State.\n\n(iii) Finally, no formal and express indication is found in the arbitration clause as to the Contracting State in respect of which the parties would have agreed to treat PT Amco as a national. According to the Respondent, such an indication is indispensable for jurisdiction to be validly based on the final provision of Article 25(2)(b). Moreover, in the circumstances of the case, this lack of a clear and formal indication in this respect resulted in an ignorance by Indonesia of the nationality of the persons who controlled PT Amco.\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants oppose these arguments, contending:\n\n\u2014 that the principle and the aim of interpretation of an arbitration is to seek to establish the true common will of the parties;\n\n\u2014 that no formal requirement is provided for as to the way in which the consent to treat the local juridical person involved in the dispute as a foreign person should be given;\n\n\u2014 and that a formal indication of the nationality based on control in the arbitration clause itself is not any more needed, the Claimants contending, in addition, that the Respondent knew PT Amco\u2019s situation in this respect.\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot share the Respondent's views as to the \u201fdoubts\" on its jurisdiction or as to its lack of jurisdiction over PT Amco.\n\n(i) In the first place, like any other conventions, a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed *restrictively*, nor, as a matter of fact, *broadly* or *liberally.* It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties: such a method of interpretation is but the application of the fundamental principle *pacta sunt servanda,* a principle common, indeed, to all systems of internal law and to international law.\n\nMoreover - and this is again a general principle of law - any convention, including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the consequences of their commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.\n\n(ii) Nothing in the Convention, and in particular in Article 25, provides for a formal requisite of an express clause stating that the parties have decided to treat a company having legally the nationality of the Contracting State, which is a party to the dispute, as a foreign company of another contracting State, because of the control to which it is submitted.\n\nWhat is needed, for the final provision of Article 25(2)(b) to be applicable, is (1) that the juridical person, party to the dispute be legally a national of the Contracting State which is the other party and (2) that this juridical person being under foreign control, to the knowledge of the Contracting State, the parties agree to treat it as a foreign juridical person.\n\nNow, in the Tribunal's view, these two conditions were fulfilled in the instance case, at the date on which the parties consented to submit possible future disputes to arbitration (which date is relevant, according to Article 25(2)(b)), and as a matter of fact, are still fulfilled today.\n\nIndeed, it is not disputed that due to its place of incorporation, to the law under which it has been incorporated and to the place of its registered seat (as well, to be said incidentally, as of its actual seat) PT Amco had and still has the nationality of Indonesia.\n\nOn the other hand. Article I of the Application states, as already recalled, that \"the APPLICANT puts forward an APPLICATION to establish a *foreign business* in Indonesia (hereafter referred to as the BUSINESS)\" (emphasis provided); and it goes on to state that \"the name of the business which will be established is PT Amco Indonesia\".\n\nHow could that not mean that PT Amco is a foreign company, in spite of it being necessarily, from a legal point of view, an Indonesian one? Moreover, Article III, paragraph 3 of the Application expressly indicates that \"all the capital of the BUSINESS represents *foreign capital\"* (emphasis provided) and that:\n\nat least on the first year of its end... will take place a gradual sale of shares to Indonesian citizens or Indonesian businesses, so that in this way at the end of the nineteenth (19th) year after the establishment of the business, all shares *become* the property of Indonesian citizens or business (emphasis provided).\n\nHow to say clearer that at the date of its establishment, PT Amco will be -and indeed was - a legally Indonesian company under foreign control?\n\nIt thus appears obvious that when agreeing to the Application, the Indonesian Government knew perfectly that PT Amco would be under foreign control. Knowing this expressly stated fact, the Government has agreed to the Application *and* to the arbitration clause in it: therefore, it is crystal clear that it agreed to treat PT Amco as a national of another Contracting State, for the purpose of the Convention.\n\nTo refer to the *Holiday Inns* award - in spite of the same not being a binding precedent in this case - here, this agreement is by no means *implied;* it is expressed, and clearly expressed, no formal or ritual clause being provided for in the Convention, nor needed in order for such an agreement to be binding on the parties.\n\n(iii) Finally, the Tribunal does not think that an objection to the binding character of the arbitration clause can be drawn, in the circumstances of the case, from the fact that the country of which the controlling shareholders of PT Amco were the nationals was not expressly mentioned in said clause, nor from the fact, alleged by the Respondent, that it did effectively not know which this country was.\n\nTaking first the legal point of view, and the contents of the agreement itself, the Tribunal will state, here again, that there is no provision in the Convention imposing a formal indication, in the arbitration clause itself, of the nationality of the foreign juridical or natural persons who control the juridical person having the nationality of the Contracting State, party to the dispute.\n\nOn the other hand, in the instance case, that nationality was clearly indicated in the Application. Indeed, paragraph 1 of the Preface of that document stated as follows:\n\n1. This Application is made and put forward in the city of Jakarta on this day. the 6th of May. Nineteen hundred and sixty-seven by AMCO ASIA CORPORATION, an organization established and controlled in its affairs by the ordinances of businesses which operate in the United States.\n\nThen paragraph 2 states that:\n\nthe Applicant resides at the address 900 Market Street, in the city of Wilmington, in the State of Delaware. United States.\n\nAccording to paragraph 4. the Applicant was:\n\nrepresented by Max Eugene Moore, in his position as President. South East Asia Representative, a business-man of United States citizenship.\n\nFinally, it is stated in Article V of the Application that:\n\nthe entire management of the business will be carried out and be in the control of the applicant as sole shareholder.\n\nIt thus appears that the nationality of the controller of PT Amco. the Indonesian juridical person to be established, was repeatedly and expressly stated in the Application to which the Indonesian Government agreed; under the circumstances, lacking any formal requirement in this respect in the Convention, there was no need for a particular statement of said nationality in the arbitration clause itself.\n\nTruth to tell. Respondent contends that the true controller of PT Amco was not of American nationality, since, it alleges, Amco Asia itself was controlled by Mr Tan, a Dutch citizen residing in Hong Kong, through Pan American, a Hong Kong company of which said Mr Tan was the sole or the main shareholder.\n\nTo take this argument into consideration, the Tribunal would have to admit first that for the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, one should not take into account the legal nationality of the foreign juridical person which controls the local one. but the nationality of the juridical or natural persons who control the controlling juridical person itself: in other words, to take care of a control at the second, and possibly third, fourth, or xth degree.\n\nSuch a reasoning is, in law, not in accord with the Convention. Indeed, the concept of nationality is there a classical one, based on the law under which the juridical person has been incorporated, the place of incorporation and the place of the social seat. An exception is brought to this concept in respect of juridical persons having the nationality, thus defined, of the Contracting State Party to the dispute, where said juridical persons are under foreign control. But no exception to the classical concept is provided for when it comes to the nationality of the foreign controller, even supposing - which is not at all clearly stated in the Convention - that the fact that the controller is the national of one or another foreign State is to be taken into account (in fact, it could be so where for political or economical reasons, it matters for the Contracting State to know the nationality of the controller or controllers, and where it is proven that would the Contracting State have known this nationality, it would not have agreed to the arbitration clause; such a situation might possibly be met in exceptional instances, but has by no means been proven, and not even alleged, in the instant case).\n\nMoreover, it appears from the letter of 14 March. 1968 (Cl. Doc. No. 39) sent by the General Manager of PT Wisma Kartika (the juridical person who was the owner of the land on which the Kartika Plaza Hotel was to be built) to Mr T. K. Tan. in Hong Kong, that two months before the filing by Mr Max E. Moore on behalf of Amco Asia of the Application. Mr Tan was asked to \"assist Max in this project\" (i.e. the hotel). This letter shows that in fact, the interest of Mr Tan in this planned investment was known, and far from raising any objection, was indeed encouraged.\n\nIncidentally, the Tribunal would like to stress that the legal and factual reasons previously stated would amply suffice to reject the argument of the Respondent that it allegedly did not know the nationality of the remote controllers of the local company to be established, when agreeing to the Application and to the arbitration clause herein. The case could have been different if there would have been fraud or misrepresentation on this issue, which is not the fact herein.\n\n15.\n\nFor all the above stated reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over PT Amco.\n\nRespondent's Submissions as to the claims of PT Amco on which it contends that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction (Submissions 2 and 3. CM at 107-108) will be dealt with when the Tribunal will examine its jurisdiction in respect of the matters in dispute.\n\nb) *Amco Asia*\n--------------\n\n16.\n\nTo deny the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Amco Asia. Respondent relies (while referring generally to the alleged principle of restrictive interpretation of limitations of sovereignty: CM. at 9-12) on the following analysis of documents and facts which it deems relevant:\n\n(i) Article IX of the Application, read together with Article I of the same document,\n\ndoes not designate Amco Asia as having a right to invoke icsid arbitration against Indonesia, and hence docs not constitute an express consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the Centre over any claim of Amco Asia against Indonesia (CM at 13).\n\n(ii) The Indonesian regulations on capital investment, relied upon by the Claimants to show Amco Asia's responsibilities in respect of the investment in question (Cl.Doc. 32. 33) refer to the \u201fcapital investor'\u2019 or simply the \u201finvestors\", not to the *foreign* investor (Observations, at 5-6);\n\n(iii) There would be significant differences between the *Holiday Inns* case, and the present one, which should lead this Tribunal to reject the extension of the arbitration clause to the parent company, while this extension had been admitted in *Holiday Inns.*\n\n17.\n\nClaimants respond to these contentions essentially in pointing out:\n\n(i) that the arbitration clause, which:\n\ncould have provided for arbitration of claims by the local corporation (the \"Perseroan Terbatas\", or \"PT\"), against Indonesia.... instead refers to disputes between Indonesia and the Business (the \"Perusahaan\"), thereby-reflecting an intent to include claims by the foreign investor for damage to its business. The intention was to cover any dispute relating to the investment Application, regardless of whether the person damaged was the Indonesian Government, the foreign investor or the local company to be incorporated through which the project would be implemented.\n\n(Reply, at 18-19) (see also, on the meaning of \"perusahaan\". Claimant's Rejoinder, at 9-10).\n\n(ii) that:\n\nthis intention and understanding is clearly reflected in Indonesia\u2019s investment incentive law of 1967 (Cl. Doc. No. 1. Art. 22)... and in Indonesia\u2019s investment promotion literature of 1968... (Reply, at 19);\n\n(iii) that:\n\nthe wording of the arbitration clause, in the context of the investment climate for Indonesia in 1968. Indonesia\u2019s Foreign Investment Law of 1967. and the other statements made by Indonesia to induce foreign investment all caused Amco Asia to believe its investment in Indonesia would be protected by icsid arbitration (Reply, at 20).\n\nadding in its Rejoinder:\n\nthat even if there were no arbitration clause. Indonesia's foreign investment law and investment promotion literature contain Indonesia's written consent to ICSID arbitration (at 18-20).\n\n18.\n\nHere again, the Tribunal will consider the issue in having essentially regard to what is, in its view, the crux of the matter, that is to say the true common will and intention of the parties, keeping in mind the fact that such will and intention are not to be drawn from a \"restrictive\" nor from a \"liberal\" interpretation of the arbitration clause, but from the normal expectations of the parties, as they may be established in view of the agreement as a whole, and of the aim and the spirit of the Washington Convention as well as of the Indonesian legislation and behaviour.\n\n19.\n\nBeforehand, the Tribunal wish to state that it does not think that the linguistic comments presented by the parties, and in particular by the Respondent on the Indonesian word \"perusahaan\" and its accurate translation into English, while highly interesting, are really relevant.\n\nThe controversy is whether this word should be translated by \"company\", as the Respondent contends it, or by \"business\", according to the Claimant\u2019s view. The consequence of the choice of the first translation would be, Respondent contends, that the \"company\" referred to being PT Amco. Article IX of the Application can be invoked by this company only, but not by Amco Asia, its parent company; on the contrary. Claimants contend that the correct translation being \"business\", Article IX covers the global enterprise composed of the parent company (Amco Asia) and the subsidiary (PT Amco).\n\n20.\n\nIt goes without saying that this Tribunal has not the slightest expertise in the Indonesian language; happily enough, in the circumstances of the case, it does not need it. As a matter of fact the Indonesian-English dictionary by John M. Echols and Hassan Shadily, of which the Claimants filed the relevant pages (425-426; Cl. Doc. No. 81) indicates for *perusahaan:* \"business, enterprise, undertaking, concern\", \"company\" not being offered as a possible translation: accordingly. Claimants seem to be right as to the linguistic problem.\n\nHowever, as already mentioned, the same Indonesian word is used in Article I. where it is stated that the name of the *\"perusahaan\"* which will be established in Indonesia is PT Amco, and in Article IX (the arbitration clause), where it is agreed that the disputes between the *\"perusahaan\"* and the Government \"will be put before the ICSID\". Consequently, the *\"perusahaan\"* expressly referred to in Article IX is PT Amco, no matter whether the Indonesian word should be translated by \"company\" or \"business\".\n\n21.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, a second argument of the Claimants is not fully conclusive.\n\nThe Claimants rely in two respects on the Indonesian Law No. 1 of 1967 and the literature to promote foreign investment:\n\n\u2014 on the one hand, as a means of interpretation of the investment agreement in this case, as including an agreement to arbitrate in respect of the foreign investor as well as of the local company;\n\n\u2014 on the other hand, as constituting by themselves a written consent of Indonesia to submit all and each of the investment disputes to icsid arbitration.\n\n22.\n\nUnder its first aspect, the argument will be considered hereunder, when the Tribunal will expose its interpretation of the investment agreement in this case.\n\nUnder the second one, the argument cannot be admitted. To be sure. Article 21 of Act No. 1. 1967 \"Re Foreign Capital Investment\" (Cl. Doc. No. 1) provides that \"the Government shall not undertake a total nationalization\", nor other analogous measures, \"except when declared by Act of Parliament that the interest of the State requires such a step\". Then, Article 23 (para. 1) goes on to say that in case of such measures, \"the Government has the obligation to provide compensation...\". to be agreed upon by the parties; paragraph 3 provides that:\n\nif no agreement can be reached between the two parties regarding the amount, type and procedure for payment of compensation, arbitration shall take place which shall be binding on both parties;\n\nFinally, paragraph 3 indicates how the arbitration board will be formed, as an *ad hoc* tribunal.\n\nNo mention is made of the ICSID arbitration in this provision, and indeed could not have been made, since at the time of enactment of that law, the Convention had not entered into force in respect of Indonesia (it did enter into force on October 28, 1968): that means necessarily that Article 23 of Law No. 1 of 1967 is not and cannot be a *direct* and *sufficient* commitment to submit investment disputes to ICSID arbitration. Moreover, the disputes referred to in Article 23 concern the determination of the compensation to be paid when one of the measures mentioned in Article 22 have been taken; now, in the present case. Indonesia denies that it took any measure of nationalization, etc.... so that the dispute seems to escape the *ad hoc* arbitration provided for in Article 23.\n\nNonetheless, these Indonesian statutory provisions may and should be taken into account when interpreting the present investment agreement in order to determine the field of implementation of the arbitration clause; they are, indeed, of significant relevance in this respect.\n\nSimilarly, and indeed *a fortiori,* promotion literature cannot be a direct commitment: however, it could be taken into account in the interpretation of the investment agreement.\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal comes now to this interpretation.\n\nThe same is obviously to be conducted in the framework of the Washington Convention, and in a way which respects its spirit and allows to reach its objectives. Suffices to point out, in this respect, the very first sentence of the Convention's Preamble:\n\nConsidering the need for international cooperation for economic development, and the role of private international investment therein.\n\nThis sentence shows that ICSID arbitration is a method of settlement which corresponds to the interests, not only of investors, but of the Contracting States as well, provided that by their adhesion to the Convention they have shown that they considered this method as being effectively in their interest, being it also understood that they keep full freedom to implement it or not, in respect of each particular investment agreement. As to the investors, it goes without saying that they have practically in all cases interest to submit to this international arbitration any and all disputes with the host State relating to the investment. Thus, the Convention is aimed to protect, to the same extent and with the same vigour the investor and the host State, not forgetting that to protect investments is to protect the general interest of development and of developing countries.\n\nAccordingly, while a consent in writing to ICSID arbitration is indispensable, since it is required by Article 25(1) of the Convention, such consent in writing is not to be expressed in a solemn, ritual and unique formulation. The investment agreement being in writing, it suffices to establish that its interpretation in good faith shows that the parties agreed to ICSID arbitration, in order for the ICSID Tribunal to have jurisdiction over them.\n\n24.\n\nSuch is the situation here.\n\nThe foreign investor was Amco Asia; PT Amco was but an instrumentality through which Amco Asia was to realize the investment.\n\nNow, the goal of the arbitration clause was to protect the investor. How could such protection be ensured, if Amco Asia would be refused the benefit of the clause? Moreover, the Tribunal did find that PT Amco had this benefit, because of the foreign control under which it is placed: would it not be fully illogical to grant this protection to the controlled entity, but not to the controlling one?\n\nNo doubt Amco Asia has understood the clause in this way. But Indonesia could not reasonably have understood it otherwise, nor reasonably have imagined that the clause would not grant protection to the investor himself, that is to say to Amco Asia. It is here that one should keep in mind the Indonesian legislation and literature: they show that the Indonesian Government considered that protection of investors through international arbitration was needed *in the interest of its country,* so that arbitration clauses to which it was going to subscribe were to be interpreted, for this reason too, as extending necessarily their benefit to the foreign investor. On their side, the investors were entitled to consider that Indonesia would not offer a \u201frestrictive\" interpretation of the arbitration clauses.\n\n25.\n\nTo conclude, there is a written consent to ICSID arbitration in the investment agreement (Article IX of the Application and its acceptance by the Government). The formal requirement of Article 25(1) of the Convention is thus fulfilled and what it left, is to interpret said written consent.\n\nSuch interpretation will lead the Tribunal to decide that the arbitration clause may be invoked by Amco Asia, over which it has, accordingly, jurisdiction.\n\nThe Tribunal does not think that this conclusion can be affected by some accessory issues or arguments which have been raised in this respect.\n\n(i) There were controversies about the subject matter of the Indonesian Regulations relating to investment: did the same concern investment in general, or foreign investment in particular?\n\nThe Tribunal will limit itself to mention, in this respect, that the \"Decree of the President of the Republic of Indonesia No. 54, year 1977\" (Cl. Doc. 32) refers expressly in the Preamble to Law No. 1. year 1967 on Foreign Capital Investment, and contains a full set of provisions relating to the same (Chapter 1. Second Part). However, it is true that such provisions have no direct bearing on the issue of jurisdiction here at stake.\n\n(ii) The parties referred again, in respect of this issue, to the *Holiday Inns* case; in particular, the Respondent pointed out that in that case, it was the parent companies that performed the investment, contending that in the present case, Amco Asia did nothing or almost nothing of that kind (which the Claimants deny).\n\nThe Tribunal will state again that in spite of superficial resemblances, the facts in the *Holiday Inns* case and in the instant one are largely different, so that the references to *Holiday Inns* are not really relevant, excepted that, as in said case, the arbitrators extended an arbitration clause to parties which had not personally executed it; accordingly, it would not seem to be contrary to that precedent (to the extent to which it is a precedent) to apply an arbitration clause to the foreign investor who filed and signed the Application for Investment in which said clause is included, even if in the literal formulation of that clause the foreign investor is not expressly mentioned.\n\nFinally, whether and to what extent Amco Asia took part itself in the building of the hotel is not relevant.\n\n26.\n\nFor all the above stated reasons, the Tribunal will conclude that it has jurisdiction over Amco Asia.\n\nc) *Pan American*\n-----------------\n\n27.\n\nTo deny the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Pan American. Respondent points out (CM. at 14) that:\n\narticle 9 of investment application submitted to Indonesia docs not mention Pan American at all and hence does not offer any basis for a finding of an express consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the Centre over any claim of Pan American against Indonesia.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, no right to invoke icsid arbitration can derive for Pan American from \"an alleged right of Amco Asia\", since \"Amco Asia itself has no right to invoke icsid arbitration.\" Moreover, according to the Respondent, the letter from the Secretary-General of the Department of Public Works and Power, to which Claimants refer (CM. Exh. 7) \"simply gave permission to PT Amco to transfer a portion of the shares held by Amco Asia Corporation to Pan American\"; \"that letter\", states the Respondent:\n\ndoes not constitute an express consent to icsid arbitration with Pan American and, under the strict constructions mandated for any alleged derogation from sovereignty. Indonesia\u2019s consent cannot be implied from that letter.\n\nVirtually the same arguments are presented in the \"Observations\" to sustain the objection against Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over Pan American.\n\n28.\n\nClaimants answer these arguments in relying on the transfer, that took place in 1972. of a \"controlling block of shares of PT Amco from Amco Asia to Pan American\", and on the approval of such transfer, in writing, by Indonesia, which according to the Claimants, has had as a consequence the transfer to Pan American of Amco Asia\u2019s \"right to icsid arbitration under the arbitration clause in the Investment Application\" (Reply at 21-22).\n\nHere again, virtually, the same arguments are put forward in Claimants' Rejoinder to Indonesia's Observations to Jurisdiction.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to recall its previous statements as to the method of interpretation of agreements relating to ICSID arbitration: the same should not be \"restrictive\" nor \"liberal\" since it is aimed to draw from the documents submitted the common will and intention of the parties, and to give full effect to that intention.\n\n30.\n\nThat being said, the Tribunal refers to the letter of the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power, dated April 25, 1972, where it is stated that this Department has \"principally no objection\" to the letter of PT Amco of April 13, 1972, with which \"it is requested that partly of the shares held by Amco Asia Corporation is [sic] permitted to be transferred to Pan American Development Company Limited\" (Cl. Doc. No. 34). This approval is confirmed with a letter of the Sub-committee for Foreign Investment. Foreign Investment Board, dated May 1. 1972, to the Secretary-General. Department of Public Works and Electric Power (Cl. Doc. No. 35).\n\n31.\n\nThe transfer thus approved was made by Amco Asia to Pan American. Now, according to the conclusion the Tribunal has reached in respect of Amco Asia, it has jurisdiction over this company; in other words, Amco Asia has the right to invoke this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over it. Amco Asia has this right in its capacity as the foreign investor who made the Application containing the arbitration clause, agreed upon by Indonesia; and it is in that capacity that Amco Asia was authorized by the Indonesian Government to establish PT Amco, and became the shareholder of the same.\n\nAccordingly, the right acquired by Amco Asia to invoke the arbitration clause is attached to its investment, represented by its shares in PT Amco, and *may* be transferred with those shares. To be sure, for such a transfer to be effective, the government of the host country must approve it, which approval has as its consequence that said government agrees to the transferee acquiring all rights attached to the shares, including the right to arbitrate, unless this latter right would be expressly excluded in the approval decision.\n\nSuch approval having been given in the instant case, it constitutes, together with Amco Asia's Request to transfer the shares, the agreement in writing to submit to ICSID arbitration the disputes with the transferee, requested by the Convention (Article 25).\n\n32.\n\nA supplementary remark should be here made.\n\nBut for an oral statement made on behalf of the Claimants during the hearings of June 28 and 29, conclusive evidence has not been brought as to whether the \"block\" of shares transferred to Pan American was or was not a \"controlling\" one.\n\nThe Tribunal does not think that this issue is relevant. Indeed. Amco Asia had and still has the right to invoke the arbitration clause in its capacity as an investor and by way of consequence, as a shareholder of PT Amco; it has not this right on behalf of PT Amco. as a \"controlling\" shareholder of the same.\n\nConsequently, the right to invoke the arbitration clause is transferred by Amco Asia with the shares it transfers, Amco Asia not losing the same right, be it as the initial investor or to the extent to which it keeps partly the shares it possessed originally. As a result, the right to invoke the arbitration clause is transferred with the transferred shares, whether or not the same constitute a controlling block, being it understood, once again, that for such transfer of the right to take place, the government's approval is indispensable.\n\n33.\n\nFor all the above stated reasons the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over Pan American.\n\nAB. *Jurisdiction over the Respondent*\n--------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nAs such, jurisdiction over the Respondent cannot be denied, since the same is a Contracting State to the Washington Convention, and since it executed an arbitration clause that according to the present decision confers [on] the Tribunal jurisdiction over the Claimants.\n\nThe issue may however arise if one has regard to the \"alternative objection to jurisdiction\", put forward under Submission No. 2 made by the Respondent in its Counter-Memorial. Indeed, this objection might be construed as alleging that the claims which the Claimants could possibly entertain should not be directed towards Indonesia, but towards PT Wisma, and that the latter not being a contracting State, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the *true* respondent.\n\nWould the alternative objection be thus construed, it would be in fact relating to the *matters* on which the Tribunal has or has not jurisdiction, an issue which the Tribunal will now consider; for the time being, and having regard to the Respondent such as the same is formally identified in the Request for Arbitration - that is to say to the Republic of Indonesia - there is no doubt that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over it.\n\nB. *Jurisdiction in Respect of the Matters in Dispute*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nAs previously recalled, the Respondent raised in the Submissions of its Counter-Memorial, an alternative objection to jurisdiction, namely that \"the Centre and this Tribunal are without jurisdiction to entertain or decide any of the claims of PT Amco relating to the alleged hotel \"seizure\" and termination of the lease agreement with PT Wisma, the latter not being a Contracting State or an agency thereof designated to the Centre by a contracting State, and disputes between private parties being outside the jurisdiction of the Centre\".\n\n36.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Tribunal in a decision of 1 April, 1983, ordered that all the Respondents\u2019 contentions relating to jurisdiction which involve examination of facts by means of testimony were to be joined to the further examination by the Tribunal of the merits of the dispute, and thus the question of whether in fact the Indonesian army did or did not seize the hotel was not supposed to be dealt with at the proceedings of the Tribunal in Paris on June 28-29, 1983 and accordingly, will be examined jointly with the merits.\n\nHowever, the question of whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction over \"the dispute regarding the hotel lease agreement\" which, according to the Respondent, \"was between two private parties, PT Amco and PT Wisma\" was examined to some extent in oral argument at the June 1983 sessions of the Tribunal.\n\n37.\n\nTo deal with this assertion, the Tribunal must first examine the subject matter of the claim before it, and reach a conclusion as to the substantive nature thereof.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that what the Tribunal is being asked to examine is \"a lease dispute\" between two private parties (CM at 19).\n\nFor their part, the Claimants state in this respect the following (Reply at 32):\n\nClaimants are not asking the Tribunal to consider disputes they may have with PT Wisma Kartika. Although the ultimate result of the military action may have been to transfer management and control of the hotel to PT Wisma Kartika, such subsequent transfer in no way affects the Tribunal's jurisdiction, even if PT Wisma Kartika were a legal entity distinct from the Indonesian government. The Indonesian government deprive Claimants of their investment in an armed military action.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that in order for it to make a judgement at this time as to the substantial nature of the dispute before it, it must look firstly and only at the claim itself as presented to ICSID and the Tribunal in the Claimants' Request for Arbitration. If on its face (that is, if there is no manifest or obvious misdescription or error in the characterization of the dispute by the Claimants) the claim is one \"arising directly out of an investment\", then this Tribunal would have jurisdiction to hear such claims. In other words, the Tribunal must not attempt at this stage to examine the claim itself in any detail, but the Tribunal must only be satisfied that *prima facie* the claim, as stated by the Claimants when initiating this arbitration, is within the jurisdictional mandate of ICSID arbitration, and consequently of this Tribunal.\n\nIn the present case, the claim, as stated by the Claimants in their request for Arbitration is one of an alleged seizure, nationalization or expropriation by Indonesia of an investment made by the Claimants in that country. Moreover, in the oral arguments, Claimants stated repeatedly: \"We do not raise disputes about the lease as 'such' (Transcript at 139)\", \"... we are just not making any claims for lease violations\". \"We are not claiming violations of the lease\" (Transcript at 139); and \"... it is not our claim today that we\u2019re trying to enforce lease provisions\" (Transcript at 140).\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration does not call upon it to arbitrate a dispute which was arisen out of \"hotel lease agreement\" as such, but which is one that arises out of an alleged nationalization or expropriation by Indonesia. This having been said, the Tribunal recognizes that the relationship between PT Amco and PT Wisma arising out of the lease might in some manner be linked to the claim made by the Claimants. But to go from this narrow recognition to the point where the Tribunal would conclude, as the Respondent would have it do, namely, that the entire claim (except for the revocation of Amco Asia\u2019s investment licence) arises out of the lease and therefore is beyond the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, is something with which the Tribunal cannot agree. On the contrary, as already stated, the claim is stated as a claim for an alleged expropriation of an investment Claimants supposedly made in Indonesia. The Tribunal cannot see any manifest or obvious misdescription or error in the characterization of this claim.\n\n39.\n\nThus, the dispute put before the Tribunal not being a dispute on the lease agreement, it follows that it is not a dispute between \"private parties\"; as already stated by the Tribunal (see AB) the Respondent is not PT Wisma but the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nAccordingly, while the Respondent rightly contends that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction over PT Wisma, such contention is not relevant, since the claim before the Tribunal is not against PT Wisma.\n\nWhether or not the Claimants are estopped from or have waived to allege and bring evidence on any actions of PT Wisma, of which they contend that Indonesia is responsible will be the subject matter of the next section.\n\n40.\n\nFor all the above stated reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction with respect to the matters of the dispute between the Claimants and Indonesia, as they are stated in the Request for Arbitration.\n\nC. *Estoppel and Waiver*\n------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Observations on Jurisdiction and at the June 1983 hearings, the Respondent put forward a number of issues of estoppel and waiver allegedly relating to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\nThese issues will be considered separately under the headings of estoppel (CA) and waiver (CB).\n\nCA. *Estoppel*\n--------------\n\n42.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial (at 89-94) the Respondent developed its contention in respect of estoppel under the following heading: \"PT Amco is estopped from asserting that PT Wisma and Indonesia are one and the same\". The same contention is reiterated in the \"Observations\" (at 18-21). Finally, a listing of grounds for estoppel was presented in oral argument during the Tribunal\u2019s session in June 1983 (at 36 ff).\n\nThe Claimants went into the analysis and refutation of these grounds for alleged estoppel in their own oral argument during the same session (Minutes, at 136 ff).\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider the grounds for alleged estoppel put forward by the Respondent, taking them as they were finally synthesized and listed in oral argument.\n\nUnder this presentation, said grounds are as follows:\n\n(i) the fact that PT Amco agreed to dispute settlement mechanisms (i.e., ICC arbitration and mutual consultations) in the 1968 hotel lease between PT Wisma and PT Amco and its subsequent amendments;\n\n(ii) the manner in which PT Amco has dealt with what has come to be called in these proceedings the *\"alter ego* theory\" in the Jakarta Court proceedings, and the manner in which the Claimants have dealt with same during the proceeding herein, namely that in the Jakarta Court proceedings PT Amco never attempted to assert any relationship between PT Wisma and Indonesia and/or the Indonesian army, nor, according to the Respondent did the Claimants attempt to do so in the current arbitration until the Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder in which the Claimants put forward the position that PT Wisma was the *\"alter ego\"* of the Respondent;\n\n(iii) the failure of PT Amco to assert in the Jakarta Court proceedings that ICSID was the proper forum for the dispute then in litigation, and indeed the insistence by PT Amco in the Jakarta procedures that the ICC was the proper forum for such dispute;\n\n(iv) the failure of PT Amco in the Jakarta Court to invoke Article 47 of the Convention and its corresponding Rule 9. namely to seek provisional measures under icsid;\n\n(v) the continued insistence of Claimants in these proceedings that the lease dispute between PT Amco and PT Wisma which was heard in the Indonesia Courts should have been and should be referred to the ICC as the proper forum.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that four out of the five grounds for estoppel hereabove analysed (namely i, iii, iv, and v) relate to the \"lease dispute\" between PT Amco and PT Wisma.\n\nNow, the Tribunal has already stated that the dispute on which it has been asked to arbitrate and on which it has jurisdiction is not the lease dispute between PT Amco and PT Wisma, and therefore, that it has no jurisdiction over PT Wisma. Consequently, these grounds for alleged estoppel are irrelevant, and the Tribunal need not consider them any further.\n\n45.\n\nAs to the second ground for estoppel, (ii), the Respondent alleges (1) that before their telex to the President of this Tribunal of March 18, 1983, the Claimants never contended that Indonesia and PT Wisma were one and the same, nor that PT Wisma was the *\"alter ego\"* of Indonesia; (2) that in the said telex, the Claimants stated that they do not contend that PT Wisma and Indonesia were one and the same: (3) finally, that in their Rejoinder. Claimants asserted that PT Wisma Kartika was merely the *alter ego* of the Indonesian \"Army\" (at 24) with respect to the hotel seizure.\n\nReplying to the foregoing the Respondent requests the Tribunal to conclude that the Claimants are now precluded from asserting that PT Wisma is the *\"alter ego\"* of Indonesia, and in consequence that PT Wisma and Indonesia are one and the same.\n\n46.\n\nIt clearly appears that the whole argument is not directed to jurisdiction, but to admissibility or non-admissibility of assertions and/or evidence which the Claimants are or are not able to present as to the relationship between PT Wisma and Indonesia.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal believes it would be useful at this point to briefly examine the concept of estoppel.\n\nThis concept is derived from the common law. However, it is based on the fundamental requirement of good faith, which is found in all systems of law, national as well as international. Nevertheless the theory of estoppel as such and as it is propounded in the Anglo-American legal systems is particular to those systems and cannot be in all details considered to have universal application.\n\nThat being said, it remains that several definitions of estoppel in common law may be used to draw from them the core of the concept, which can and should be applied in international disputes such as the present one.\n\nAs examples of such definitions, the Tribunal would cite first the one found in *The Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation.* (Spencer. Bower and Turner. 3rd edition. Butterworth. 1977), at page 4, which concerns estoppel by representation, that incidentally is relevant to the present case, and which reads as follows:\n\nWhere one person (\"the representor\") has made a representation to another person (\"the representee\") in words or by acts or conduct or (being under a duty to the representee to speak or act) by silence or inaction, with the intention (actual or presumptive) and with the result, of inducing the representee on the faith of such representation to alter his position to his detriment, the representor in any litigation which may afterwards take place between him and the representee, is estopped, as against the representee, from making or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment substantially at variance with his former representation, if the representee at the proper time, and in the proper manner, objects thereto.\n\nAnother apt definition may be found in the case of *Maclaine* v. *Gatty* (1921). AC 376 where at page 382 Lord Birkenhead stated:\n\nWhere A has by his words or conduct justified B in believing that a certain state of facts exists, and B has acted upon such belief to his prejudice. A is not permitted to affirm against B that a different state of facts existed at the time.\n\nIn international law, one may find, again as an example, a definition which similarly combines the elements of prejudice to one party and advantage to the other in order for the substance of estoppel, whatever the term employed to describe the same, to be met:\n\nA State must not be permitted to benefit by its own inconsistency to the prejudice of another State (Vice-President Alfare in the case concerning the *Temple of Preah Vihar, Cambodia* v. *Thailand.* 1962 I.C.J. 6. 39-51),\n\nAlthough this dictum refers to activities of States, the Tribunal is of the view that the same general principle is applicable in international economic relations where private parties are involved. In addition, the Tribunal considers that, in particular for its applications in international relations, the whole concept is characterized by the requirement of good faith.\n\n48.\n\nIn the instant case, the Tribunal has no hesitation in finding that (1) the argument of estoppel does not go to the issue of jurisdiction, but to the admissibility or non-admissibility of assertions or evidence; (2) the elements of the concept, i.e. benefit to the allegedly estopped party and/or prejudice to the other, are not present, which excludes necessarily any bad faith of the Claimants.\n\n49.\n\nFor all the above stated reasons.\n\n(1) the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants are not estopped from invoking the arbitration clause in the dispute and against the Respondent as the same are stated in the Request;\n\n(2) the Claimants are not estopped from asserting and from bringing evidence to show that, in respect of the facts of this case, PT Wisma and Indonesia were one and the same, or that PT Wisma was the *\"alter ego\"* of Indonesia;\n\n(3) however, the value of the assertions or of the evidence thus produced will have to be decided upon when deciding on the merits; at that time, the whole behaviour of both parties, and in particular their successive positions or statements would have to be taken into account.\n\nCB. *Waiver*\n------------\n\n50.\n\nRespondent argued that even if jurisdiction is found to exist because the estoppel arguments do not lead the Tribunal to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction herein, then the Claimants must be considered to have waived any rights to any hearing on the merits of their claim because PT Amco fully and completely participated in the Indonesian court proceedings and indeed PT Amco did not request a stay of those proceedings so that the matter then in issue could be brought before ICSID for arbitration (CM. at 95 ff).\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal finds in the first place that the parties to the Jakarta Court case are not identical to the parties in the present proceedings. PT Wisma was one of the parties to the court proceedings and it is not a party here (although its actions may to the extent they are relevant to the claims under arbitration herein, be part of the evidence heard by this Tribunal on the merits). Indonesia, as such, which is the Respondent in the present arbitration was not a party to the Jakarta court proceedings.\n\nLikewise, as the Tribunal has stated above, the issues to be arbitrated by the Tribunal are not as suggested by the Respondent a lease dispute, which was the object of the Jakarta legal proceedings.\n\n52.\n\nFor all the above stated reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants did not waive their right to invoke the icsid arbitration clause, and consequently this Tribunal's jurisdiction, in respect of the claim as stated and of the Respondent as identified in the Request for Arbitration.\n\nThe Tribunal Decides as Follows:\n\nThe Tribunal has jurisdiction over the parties to the dispute and the subject-matter of the same as identified and described by the Claimants."}, {"Title": "Decision on Request for Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "1983-12-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Request for Provisional Measures\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn September 30. 1983. the Republic of Indonesia (\"the Respondent\") filed with the Tribunal a Request for Recommendation of Provisional Measures, concluded by a Submission which reads as follows:\n\nMay it please the Tribunal to recommend as a provisional measure pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention:  \nThat claimants take no action of any kind which might aggravate or extend the dispute submitted to the Tribunal, and in particular that they abstain from promoting, stimulating, or instigating the publication of propaganda presenting their case selectively outside this Tribunal or otherwise calculated to discourage foreign investment in Indonesia.\n\nIn fact, the Respondent contends that such provisional measures would be justified by an article published on the front page of a Hong Kong newspaper. *The Business Standard,* on June 27. 1983. According to the Respondent, said article, which relates several statements attributed to Mr T. K. Tan. \u201fthe controlling shareholder of Claimants\", about the alleged nationalization of the Kartika Plaza Hotel, the procedure in the Jakarta Courts and the request for arbitration filed with the ICSID:\n\nrecounted a one-sided version of the Claimant\u2019s story in tones designed to be detrimental to international perceptions of the climate for foreign investment in Indonesia.\n\nWhile admitting that \"the publication of a single article in a journal of such limited circulation hardly could amount to more than a nuisance\", Respondent contends further that \"it could lead to serious exacerbation of the dispute between the parties and irreparable harm to the economy of Indonesia\".\n\nIn law, Respondent relies on Article 47 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes, which enables the Tribunal to \"recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party\".\n\nFurthermore, Respondent contends that \"Claimants\u2019 action is inconsistent with Claimants\u2019 acceptance of icsid arbitration \u2018to the exclusion of any other remedy\u2019 under Article 26\" (of the Convention) \"and with the requirement of good faith which inheres in all international proceedings and certainly envelops the parties to an arbitration before the Centre\".\n\n\"Finally\", Respondent alleges. \"Claimants\u2019 actions are incompatible with the spirit of confidentiality which imbues these international arbitral proceedings\", relying in this respect on several provisions of the Convention (Article 48(5)) and of the Arbitration Rules (namely Rules 48(4). 37(2). 6(2). 15 and 31(2)).\n\n2.\n\nOn October 28, 1983, Claimants filed a Reply to this Request, of which the conclusion reads as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal should refrain from adopting a provisional measure such as requested here, which is not needed, conflicts with the provisions of the Rules, is without precedent, and would be impossible to police.\n\nIn fact, Claimants produce three articles, published in Indonesia in 1982 and 1983, that is to say before the publication of the article in the Hong Kong newspaper. Two of these articles are exhibited with partial translation, that show that they contained a description of the case which was not contrary to the one presented by the Respondent in the arbitral procedure.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants allege that the article in *The Business Standard* did no harm to Indonesia, and state that they \"bear the country of Indonesia no ill will, have no intention of discouraging foreign investment there, and have no power to do so\".\n\nIn law, Claimants contend that \"the Convention and Arbitration Rules do not prohibit individual parties from discussing the case and the status of the arbitration, publicly or otherwise\". They stress that Respondent did not specify the \"rights to be preserved\" by the provisional measure it requests, such as required by Rule 39(1).\n\nFinally, coming back to facts, Claimants point out that the order requested \"would be impossible to police\", since numerous people in the Indonesian government and shareholders of Amco Asia and Pan American know about the case.\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal finds, as admitted by Respondent, that the article published in *The Business Standard* could not have done any actual harm to Indonesia, nor aggravate or exacerbate the legal dispute now put before the Tribunal; moreover, a careful reading of said article shows that the recital it contains is presented as based on Mr Tan\u2019s supposed statements (however not as an interview), thus not relating facts of which its author warrants the truthfulness. In this respect, it might well be that the descriptions found in the Indonesian articles produced by claimants could have a stronger influence on the perception of the case by the readers.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants rightly point out that Rule 39(1), implementing the very general provision of Article 47 of the Convention, requires the party which solicits a provisional measure to specify the rights that such measure would be purported to preserve. Obviously, the rights to which this provision is relating are the rights in dispute, and no such right could be threatened by the publication of articles like those which are produced by both parties. Moreover, it can not be seriously contended that the article in *The Hong Kong Business Standard* may have whatever influence on Indonesia\u2019s economy.\n\nIt might possibly be that a large press campaign could have such an influence. However, even so, it would not be an influence on rights in dispute: and at any event, the unique article produced by the Respondent does not permit to suppose that Claimants are planning such a campaign.\n\nNor can this article show any bad faith of the Claimants in the arbitral procedure; and obviously, such an article, would it even be proved that it was \"promoted\" by the Claimants, does not mean that the same rely on any legal remedy other than the ICSID arbitration.\n\n4.\n\nFinally, as to the \"spirit of confidentiality\" of the arbitral procedure, it is right to say that the Convention and the Rules do not prevent the parties from revealing their case; here again, it should be noticed that the articles published in Indonesia provided the readers with more details on the arbitral procedure than the one published in *The Hong Kong Business Standard.*\n\n5.\n\nAll these remarks do by no means weaken the good and fair practical rule, according to which both parties to a legal dispute should refrain, in their own interest, to do anything that could aggravate or exacerbate the same, thus rendering its solution possibly more difficult. However, in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal does not find any symptom of an intention of the one or the other party to take steps that could have such consequences; accordingly, the Tribunal does not deem it appropriate to issue a recommendation to the parties - which, moreover, is not requested by Claimants - such recommendation not seeming to be presently needed.\n\n6.\n\nFor the above stated reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's Request for Recommendation of Provisional Measures."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "1984-11-20T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\nPart I - Procedure and Facts\n----------------------------\n\nCHAPTER I \u2014 PROCEDURE\n---------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present arbitration was initiated on January 15, 1981 when Amco Asia Corporation (hereinafter called \"Amco Asia\"), Pan American Development Limited (hereinafter called \"Pan American\") and PT Amco Indonesia (hereinafter called \"PT Amco\"), collectively the Claimants, filed with the Secretary-General, icsid, a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Indonesia (hereinafter called \"the Respondent\").\n\nParagraph 1 of the said Request stated the following:\n\nAmco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development Limited and PT Amco hereby request arbitration of a legal dispute with the Republic of Indonesia arising directly out of their hotel investment in Indonesia in 1968. The investment was authorized by the Republic for a period of 30 years but in 1980 the Republic seized the investment in an armed, military action and cancelled the investment licence. The parties dispute the right of the Republic to seize the investment and cancel the licence.\n\nThe Claimants requested that:\n\ndamages be awarded against the Republic in the amount of not less than US $9,000,000, together with interest from March 31, 1980, costs and disbursements of this arbitration, counsel fees and such other and further relief as the Centre shall deem just.\n\n2.\n\nAfter the Tribunal was composed, a \"Proposal... for disqualification of an arbitrator\", filed by the Respondent on June 21, 1982, was rejected by the two unchallenged arbitrators by a decision of June 24, 1982.\n\n3.\n\nFollowing said decision and on the same day, Claimants filed with the Tribunal a \"Statement of Facts and Law\", dated June 21, 1982, in support of the Request for Arbitration which concluded that the Claimants \"should be awarded compensation of not less than US $12,494,000 together with interest and cost\".\n\nFollowing an order of the Tribunal, Respondent filed its Counter Memorial (hereinafter called \"CM\") on December 30, 1982, which besides opposing the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claim, raised objections to jurisdiction which were the subject matter of an award on jurisdiction by the Tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nDetails of the procedures which were followed on the jurisdictional questions are given in the Award on Jurisdiction of September 25, 1983 to which reference is hereby made in this respect. In said award, the Tribunal decided as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal has jurisdiction over the parties to the dispute and the subjectmatter of the same as identified and described by the Claimants.\n\nAs to the description of the subject-matter of the dispute, thus mentioned, reference is hereby made to the excerpts of Claimants\u2019 conclusions in their Reply to Indonesia\u2019s Counter-Memorial and in their Rejoinder to Indonesia\u2019s Observations on Jurisdiction, reproduced in the Award on Jurisdiction, and in particular to the conclusion of Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder which read as follows:\n\nFor the reasons stated in Claimant\u2019s Reply and Rejoinder, the Tribunal should find that Indonesia has consented in writing to icsid arbitration with each Claimant, and that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction extends to ail of Claimant\u2019s causes of action.\n\nThe definition of said causes of action, as presented by the Claimants and discussed by the Respondent during the procedure on the merits is to be found hereunder (see para. 142).\n\n5.\n\nAfter the Request for Arbitration was filed with the ICSID, the parties filed the following briefs on the merits (some of which dealt with jurisdiction as well, but they are mentioned hereunder only in respect of the allegations and contentions they contain on the merits):\n\n\u2014 Claimants\u2019 Statement of Facts and Law, dated June 21, 1982;\n\n\u2014 Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, dated December 30, 1982;\n\n\u2014 Claimants\u2019 Reply to Indonesia\u2019s Counter-Memorial, dated February 28, 1983;\n\n\u2014 Indonesia\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, dated October 31, 1983.\n\n6.\n\nTwo sessions of hearings were held to hear witnesses and oral argument, namely:\n\n\u2014 in Washington DC, from December 19 to December 23, 1983;\n\n\u2014 in Copenhagen (Denmark) from March 19 to March 23, 1984.\n\nDuring the first session, the following witnesses testified:\n\nMr Antonius Josephus Schussel,  \nMajor X,  \nMr. Y.

Gautama for Respondent.\n\nCHAPTER II \u2014FACTS\n-----------------\n\n*Section I - Setting up of Investment*\n--------------------------------------\n\nA. *1968 Lease and Management Agreement*\n----------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe dispute before the Tribunal has for its genesis an investment in Indonesia contemplated in 1968 by a US citizen, Mr Max E. Moore. Mr Moore thought, in 1967, that as a result of the economic situation then pertaining in Indonesia, there would be opportunities for venturesome private foreign investors who could, at the same time, provide considerable assistance to the economic recovery of the host country.\n\n8.\n\nMr Moore undertook one or two projects in Jakarta in 1967 and 1968, which were evidently successful, and as a result of this experience was approached by an Indonesian company, PT Wisma Kartika (hereinafter referred to as \"PT Wisma\"), which had the rights to some land at Jalan M. H. Thamrin, No. 10, in Jakarta, Indonesia, to see whether Mr Moore, or one of the companies he controlled, would be interested in participating in a hotel project on the site.\n\n9.\n\nPT Wisma was established in October, 1964, under the same PT Pembangunan and Pengurus Flat Bluntas, commonly known as PT Bluntas, by the Bank of Indonesia and an Indonesian private investor to acquire the Jalan Thamrin site and to develop thereon an apartment/hotel complex. The project progressed to the stage where the structural framework of the basement and the first two floors of the proposed building had been erected when construction stopped in 1965 due to lack of funds. In 1967, at the order of the new Indonesian Government, both the Indonesian private investor and the Bank of Indonesia, who together owned all of the issued and outstanding shares of PT Bluntas, sold such shares to Induk Koperasi Angkatan Darst, Indonesian army personnel (sic). Inkopad was formed under Law No. 12 of 1967, which is the Law on the Basic Regulation for Cooperatives in Indonesia. According to its Amended Articles of Association, amended on June 29, 1979, Inkopad is a cooperative of various other \"Central Cooperatives in the sphere of the Indonesian Army\" and is \"functional in nature\" (Resp. Legal Appendices vol. IX. Tab A-3). Its purpose is \"to administer the organization and methods of work of its members in an effort to achieve the well-being of soldiers and their families\", and a \"vehicle for helping Army Leadership\" in connection with the welfare of military personnel and their dependents. Some of the tasks assigned to Inkopad, according to its Amended Articles of Association, are to encourage savings by its members, organizing activities in, among other things, general travel, low-cost housing, the hotel industry, tourism, consulting and construction, providing guidance to members in their various ventures, providing education to \"members of the Indonesian army and society in general to increase their knowledge\" of cooperatives. Among other things, each member of Inkopad is entitled to be elected to the Board of Directors \"provided Army Leadership has not decided otherwise\". Only a person who, \"in the estimate of the Army Leadership, is capable of taking on the responsibilities of a Director\" can act as a Director and in the performance of his tasks, a Director must be \"mindful of the decisions of (the) Army Leadership\". According to Article 19 of the Amended Articles of Association, Inkopad \"is under the government\u2019s guidance and supervision which is carried out by the Government Official and Army Leadership\". In testimony presented to the Tribunal, it was stated that the Chairman of Inkopad is an active army officer and is nominated by the army-Chief-of-Staff, but that the Chairman reports to the Welfare Officer of the army (see Washington Testimony of General Soerjo at 634-5). Likewise the budget and certain other matters concerning Inkopad are sent to the Indonesian army staff. Inkopad caused the name PT Bluntas to be changed to that of PT Pembangunan dan Pengurusan Wisma \"Kartika\" or PT Wisma \"Kartika\" (Cl. Doc. 2 and Resp. CM, pp. 20-1 and Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. 1 Nos 10 and 11). PT Wisma was reorganized (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. VII No. 12), and began to seek ways to develop the Jalan Thamrin site to which it had rights into a hotel, because at that time, Jakarta needed hotels of international standards which could be used by international businessmen and investors who wished to visit Indonesia.\n\n10.\n\nAfter Mr Moore was approached by PT Wisma about the hotel project, serious negotiations ensued and a lease and management agreement (hereinafter referred to as the \"1968 Lease and Management Agreement\") was made and entered into on April 22, 1968 by and between (a) Amco Asia Corporation (hereinafter referred to as \"Amco\"), a company incorporated in the State of Delaware, USA, and represented for the purpose by Mr Moore, who was described as the President of Amco and its South East Asian representative, and (b) PT Wisma, represented for the purpose by Lieu Col. (Ret.) H. Suetjipto (Cl. Doc. 3).\n\n11.\n\nThe 1968 Lease and Management Agreement called for Amco to complete, at Amco\u2019s cost, the construction of the structure on the Jalan Thamrin site which had been abandoned since 1965, namely the basement and two stories of what the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement called, \"the Annex\". Moreover, Amco undertook to build another six storey high rise section of the building. The Annex was intended for shops and offices, whereas the high rise was to be for a \"hotel and/or apartments\". Amco undertook to invest \"up to the sum of US $4,000,000 (four million dollars US) both for the completion of the Annex and for the construction of the High Rise\", of which \"up to US $1,000,000\", (divided into \"up to US $800,000\" as \"Equity Capital Investment\" and \"up to US $200,000\" as \"Loan Capital Investment\" was to be used for the Annex and \"up to US $3,000,000\" (divided into \"up to US $2,200,000\" as \"Equity Capital Investment\" and \"up to US $800,000\" as \"Loan Capital Investment\") was destined for the high rise. PT Wisma was to contribute five million (5,000,000) rupiahs \"for use by Amco Asia and to furnish certain existing air conditioning equipment\". The Annex was to be completed no later than fifteen months from the date the Indonesian Foreign Capital Investment Committee granted its approval for Amco\u2019s investment in Indonesia, and the high rise was to be finished no later than twenty-four months after completion of the Annex (in both cases delays caused by *force majeure* were to be considered permissible delays and thus the completion dates set by the parties could be extended accordingly). The construction was to be \"in accordance with accepted standards and practices\" and the fittings, materials and equipment were to be of \"a reasonable standard\". In consideration of the financing and the carrying out by Amco of the construction and outfitting of the structures, PT Wisma agreed to grant Amco a nineteen year lease for both structures commencing on the date of the completion of the Annex. A profit-sharing agreement was specified as follows:\n\n\u2014 for the first five years of the lease term:  \nAmco = 90%, PT Wisma = 10%\n\n\u2014 for the next five years:  \nAmco = 85%, PT Wisma = 15%\n\n\u2014 for the five years thereafter:  \nAmco = 75%, PT Wisma = 25%\n\n\u2014 and for the remainder:  \nAmco = 50%, PT Wisma = 50%.\n\nThere was a provision in the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement to the effect that Amco had the option of either establishing a wholly owned Indonesian subsidiary in the framework of the Foreign Capital Investment Act No. 1 of 1967 or establishing a joint venture company with PT Wisma. It was agreed that all disputes would be settled first, \"by means of direct communication and negotiation\", and then, if this approach did not bear fruit, \"impartial arbitration\" would be the vehicle for the settlement of disputes, and if the parties could not agree on an arbitrator, reference would be made to the President of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.\n\nB. *Foreign Capital Investment Law - Act No. 1/1967*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the \"New Order\", both politically and economically in Indonesia, it became apparent to the Indonesian Government that in order to build up the economy, foreign capital would have to be attracted to invest in the country, and in order to accomplish this goal, certain tax and other concessions would have to be granted to foreign investors. Thus, in January 1967, Act No. 1/1967 entitled \"Re: Foreign Capital Investment\" was enacted (hereinafter referred to as the \"1967 Foreign Investment Law\").\n\n13.\n\nThe 1967 Foreign Investment Law stated by its terms that it applied to \"direct investment of foreign capital\", which was defined as:\n\na. foreign exchange which does not form a part of the foreign exchange resources of Indonesia, and which with the approval of the Government is utilized for financing and enterprise in Indonesia,\n\nb. equipment for an undertaking, including rights to technological developments and materials imported into Indonesia, provided that said equipment is not financed from Indonesian foreign exchange resources,\n\nc. that part of the profits which in accordance with this law is permitted to be transferred, is instead reinvested in Indonesia.\n\n14.\n\nAccording to the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, a foreign enterprise in order to benefit from its provisions had to be constituted as \"a legal entity organized under Indonesian law and have its domicile in Indonesia\". Such entities could not have a duration of longer than thirty years.\n\n15.\n\nThe Indonesian Government was empowered to determine which fields of activity were open to foreign investors and to establish on a case by case basis the conditions a foreign investor had to meet in order for such investor\u2019s application to receive approval. The foreign investor, once his investment application was approved, had\u2019 the full right to appoint management for its Indonesian operations but was required to employ Indonesian nationals whenever possible.\n\n16.\n\nTo meet the requirements of the foreign enterprises it was possible that \"land with the right of construction, the right of exploitation, and the right of use\" could be obtained.\n\n17.\n\nAs mentioned above, one of the main attractions to foreign investors of making an approved investment in Indonesia in the context of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law was the tax concessions which were available, namely:\n\na) exemption from corporation tax on profits for a period to be negotiated but not in any event greater than five years from date of production started;\n\nb) exemption from dividend tax on accrued profits paid to foreign shareholders on profits earned during \"a period not exceeding five years from\" the date of production started;\n\nc) exemption on accrued profits after deduction of taxes and other financial obligations in Indonesia, which the foreign investor was entitled to remit outside of Indonesia but which if it did not remit but reinvested in Indonesia, for a period not to exceed five years from the date of reinvestment;\n\nd) exemption from import duties at the time of entry of machinery, equipment, materials and supplies needed to operate the foreign investor\u2019s business;\n\ne) exemption from capital stamp tax \"on the movement of capital originating from foreign capital investment\";\n\nf) reduction of corporation tax to \"a proportional rate\" of not more than 50%, for a period not exceeding five years after the expiry of the exemption referred to in a) above;\n\ng) any loss incurred during the tax-exempt period referred to in a) above could be carried forward indefinitely after the expiry of the said taxexempt period;\n\nh) allowance for accelerated depreciation of fixed assets; and\n\ni) other concessions which may be granted on a case by case basis.\n\n18.\n\nIndonesian companies established by foreign investors under the aegis of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law had the right under the said law to transfer out of Indonesia in the currency of the original investment, the following:\n\na) accrued profits \"after deduction of taxes and other financial obligations in Indonesia\";\n\nb) costs relating to the employment of foreign personnel working in Indonesia;\n\nc) other costs determined from time to time by the Government;\n\nd) \"depreciation of capital assets\";\n\ne) \"compensation in case of nationalization\".\n\nTransfer permits or capital repatriation were not to be granted as long as the tax concessions referred to in paragraph 11 above were still in effect.\n\n19.\n\nIt should be noted that the 1967 Foreign Investment Law did not consider loans, even those from foreign sources, as constituting \"foreign capital\" for purposes of the law. Nor did the said law set out any sanction in the event a foreign investor breached the terms of its foreign investment approval or licence. However, sanctions were provided for by other regulations (see hereunder, para. 193).\n\nC. *Application by Amco for a Foreign Investment Licence*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nOn May 6, 1968 (even though it is stated as being May 6, 1967) Amco submitted to the Government of the Republic of Indonesia an \"Application to Establish PT Amco Indonesia\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Investment Application\" (Cl. Doc. No. 5, Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. I No. 4) in which, among other things, Amco, citing the provisions of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law, sought permission to carry out business in the field of real estate \"in the broadest meaning of the word, without limitation, among other things involving the acquisition, purchase, leasing, rental, construction, rehabilitation management and other such actions on all types and forms of real estate property such as buildings, hotels, offices, recreation places and so on\" in Indonesia, and to establish PT Amco Indonesia (hereinafter referred to as \"PT Amco\") as the vehicle through which such business was to be carried on. PT Amco was to have a thirty year existence.\n\n21.\n\nThe capital of PT Amco, as set out in the Investment Application, was to be US $3,000,000 \"all of which represents share capital divided into three hundred (300) shares with a nominal value of US $10,000 each\", and all of which \"represents foreign capital\". The capital was to be \"deposited stage by stage and may take the form of cash, capital goods or both\". Reference was made in the Foreign Investment Application to an \"Attachment V\", which was evidently annexed to the Investment Application and which apparently was entitled \"Deposit Schedule and Form of Capital\" and which supposedly set out the schedule according to which the foreign investment was to be made and the manner of form in which it was to be contributed by Amco. This important piece of evidence apparently could not be located by any of the parties and thus was not made available to the Tribunal.\n\n22.\n\nInward and outward remittances of funds in respect of the Amco foreign investment \"insofar as Government Regulations permit and make possible\", were to be effected through \"the Supplementary Foreign Exchange Account (D. P. Account)\".\n\n23.\n\nIn its original Investment Application (which was subsequently amended, see para. 28 below), Amco sought the following concessions from the Indonesian Government:\n\na) the right to transfer profits;\n\nb) the right to transfer business personnel costs, such as a portion of salary, pension funds and others;\n\nc) depreciation on fixed capital;\n\nd) costs/fees for the payment of foreign contractors and others;\n\ne) exemption from corporate tax for five years;\n\nf) exemption from dividend tax for five years;\n\ng) exemption for stamp duty on capital at the time of the establishment of PT Amco;\n\nh) exemption from import duties on the import of capital;\n\ni) exemption from import duties for two years with the possibility of the extension of such exemptions for the import of spare and replacement parts.\n\n24.\n\nThe Investment Application contained an arbitration clause which stated that if a dispute arose between PT Amco and the Government of Indonesia, the dispute would be put before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\n25.\n\nIt appears that six attachments, including the Annual Report and other information, references, bonafides, and proof of financial strength of Amco, the Deposit and Form of Capital Schedule, a copy of the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement and a Power of Attorney were annexed to the Investment Application, Of the six, only the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement was produced to the Tribunal (see para. 21 above).\n\n26.\n\nOn May 11, 1968 the Indonesian Foreign Investment Board, the body charged with preliminary examination of foreign investment proposals, conveyed to Mr Moore certain changes in the Investment Application which the Board would like to see. It seems that the Board also advised Mr Moore that if he accepted the suggested changes to the Investment Application, the Board would recommend approval of the Investment Application immediately.\n\n27.\n\nApparently Mr Moore agreed verbally to the Foreign Investment Board\u2019s recommended amendments to the Investment Application because on May 11, 1968 the Chairman of the Indonesian Foreign Investment Board wrote on behalf of the Board to the Chairman of the Foreign Investment Evaluation Body of Indonesia, to the effect that the amended Investment Application \"has been studied... and agreed upon in principle\" by the Board. In addition, the Board proposed \"that permission to invest be left to the power of the Minister of Public Works\" (Cl. Doc. vol. I No. 6).\n\n28.\n\nOn May 13, 1968 Amco Asia, based on its previous discussions with the Foreign Investment Board (see para. 26 ff. above), filed an Amendment to its Investment Application (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 16). According to the Amendment, the purpose for which Amco sought permission to establish PT Amco was redefined and narrowed to: \"to be active in the field of real estate business, namely to construct new buildings, rehabilitate existing business, and control, sell and rent out these buildings\". The authorized share capital of PT Amco was to remain the same as that set out in the original Investment Application, namely US $3,000,000 but was to be composed differently: whereas originally the US $3,000,000 was to be divided into three hundred (300) shares with a nominal value of US $10,000.00 each, it was, according to the Amendment, to be changed to US $3,000,000 divided into thirty thousand (30,000) shares with a nominal value of US $100.00 per share.\n\n29.\n\nIn the Amendment the tax concessions sought by Amco for PT Amco were amended as follows:\n\na) the right sought to transfer the costs/fees for the payment for persons\n\nother than foreign contractors was deleted;\n\nb) the exemption sought from corporate taxes was reduced from five years to three years;\n\nc) the exemption sought from dividend tax was reduced from five years to three years;\n\nd) the exemption sought from import duties on the import of capital was dropped;\n\ne) the exemption from import duties originally sought for only two years with the possibility of extending such exemption to the import of spare and replacement parts, was amended by eliminating any time frame for the exemption of import duties with respect to the import of capital goods and extending same to parts for such capital goods, but this exemption was only to apply if PT Amco used \"its own foreign exchange or supplemental foreign exchange in the limits set in the Government regulations in force\".\n\n30.\n\nIn addition, Amco agreed that any methods it might use for calculating profits or losses in its private business relationships and dealings in Indonesia would not be binding on the Government which, for the purposes of taxes, would be entitled to determine PT Amco\u2019s profits/losses in accordance with the Government\u2019s prevailing laws and regulations.\n\n31.\n\nOn May 13, 1968, the President of the Republic of Indonesia wrote to the Minister of Public Works that, based on the letter of May 11, 1968, from the Foreign Investment Board (see para. 27 above), the President agreed \"in principle\" to Amco\u2019s Amended Investment Application (Cl. Doc. vol. I No. 7).\n\n32.\n\nOn July 29, 1968, the Minister of Public Works of Indonesia granted permission to Amco to establish PT Amco within the framework of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law and in accordance with the Investment Application, as amended, and ordered that PT Amco be established within two months of his grant of permission.\n\nD. *Establishment of PT Amco*\n-----------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation of PT Amco were set out in Notarial Document No. 106 of Notary Abdul Latief on September 27, 1968 (Cl. Doc. No. 10). The said Deed establishing the Articles of Incorporation was signed by Mr Max Eugene Moore, as representative of Amco and Mr Zoelkarnain Ali, acting pursuant to a Power of Attorney as representative of Mr Tan Tjin Kuan (hereinafter referred to as \"Mr Tan\"), described as a \"businessman, dwelling in Vancouver, Canada, Dutch Citizen\".\n\n34.\n\nThe Articles stated that the purpose and objectives of PT Amco was to:\n\nbe active in the field of real estate business, that is managing: the construction of new buildings, the rehabilitation of existing buildings, management, sales and rentals of said buildings; with the understanding that the meaning of said real estate business does not include construction contracting in any form whatsoever.\n\n35.\n\nThe Articles stated that PT Amco was to \"begin operations on the day these Articles of Incorporation have been approved and validated by those who have authority to do so\", which in the circumstances was the Minister of Justice of Indonesia.\n\n36.\n\nFurthermore, according to Deed No. 106, PT Amco was to \"be established for a period of seventy-five years\" (this provision, as it will be seen later, was not acceptable to the Minister of Justice because it did not conform with the amended Investment Application and was subsequently amended: see para. 39 below).\n\n37.\n\nThe authorized capital of PT Amco was to be US $3,000,000 divided into 30,000 shares, with a par value of US $100.00 each. Of the authorized capital, 20% or 6,000 shares of a par value of US $600.00 were declared as issued, with 10% having been paid up, half of which were issued to and paid for by Amco and the other half of which were issued to and paid for by Mr Tan. Later, it was confirmed that this amount was paid in cash. No mention was made in Deed No. 106 as to when the balance of the authorized capital had to be paid except a provision to the effect that additional issue of shares was to \"be at times determined by the Board of Directors, giving consideration to the regulations of the Government, which require that each party concerned be notified in writing\". (The question as to when the balance of the authorized capital was to be paid up was also subsequently clarified at the request of the Minister of Justice, see para. 39 below).\n\n38.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation were submitted on November 8, 1968 to the Minister of Justice for approval in accordance with Indonesian law but evidently his Ministry raised certain issues with which it was not satisfied, including those referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37 above, among others, and accordingly on 13 December 1968, Notary Abdul Latief before whom Notarial Doc. No. 106, which contained the PT Amco Articles of Incorporation was signed, executed Notarial Document No. 49, for the purpose, as it was put, \"to avoid differences with the party responsible for approval\" of the Articles of Incorporation. Notarial Document No. 49 amended the duration of PT Amco\u2019s existence from the seventy-five years contemplated in Notarial Document No. 106 to \"a period of thirty years under authority, of Law No. 1 of the year 1967, regarding Foreign Capital Investment, except if said permission for Foreign Capital Investment is renewed\" (Cl. Doc. 10). This amendment brought the Articles of Incorporation into line with the amended Investment Application and the approval of the Minister of Public Works.\n\n39.\n\nNotarial Doc. No. 49 also added a new provision to the Articles of Incorporation, namely, that \"the entire unissued portion of shares must be issued within a period of ten years, beginning today, unless this time period should be extended by those responsible, or if required at the request of the Board of Directors\". The Tribunal does not know whether or not this text was added in order to bring the Articles of Incorporation of PT Amco into conformity with the amended Investment Application, because, as alluded to earlier (see para. 21 above), the Tribunal was not furnished with the Attachment V to the amended Investment Application which contained the time schedule and form according to which Amco was to pay up the US $3,000,000 it undertook to invest in PT Amco. At any event, no evidence of any decision to extend the time period of ten years was put before the Tribunal.\n\n40.\n\nOn January 25, 1969, the Minister of Justice approved the said Articles of Incorporation of PT Amco, which were then registered at the Central Jakarta District Court on January 29, 1969. On April 4, 1969, the Articles of Association of PT Amco were published in Supplement No. 27 to the State Gazette of Indonesia No. 41 of 1969 (Cl. Doc. 10).\n\n*Section II - Implementation of the Investment*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nA. *Participation of Pan American Development Limited in PT Amco*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nOn October 26, 1968, Amco Asia entered into an \"Agreement of Appointment\" with Pan American Development Limited (hereinafter referred as \"Pan American\"), a limited liability company incorporated on May 8, 1968, under the laws of Hong Kong, having its registered office at Room 312, Chartered Bank Building, Des Voeux Road, Honk Kong (Resp. Exh. to CM vol. II No. 20).\n\n42.\n\nThe Agreement of Appointment, which was described as being governed by the law of Hong Kong, and which was never made available to the Government of Indonesia, stated that Amco \"in fact entered into\" the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement with PT Wisma \"as agent and nominee for and on behalf of \"Pan American\", and that Amco held its interest in the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement for and on behalf of Pan American.\n\n43.\n\nOn April 13, 1971, a written report was submitted to the Minister of Public Works, stating that \"since the beginning (sic) Amco Asia Corporation and Pan American Development Co. Ltd have jointly invested their capital in the Hotel Kartika Plaza Project\", and that Pan American was a foreign company incorporated in Hong Kong. The request, signed by the then General Manager of PT Amco, was then made seeking that Pan American be recognized as a \"capital investor in the Hotel Kartika Plaza Project, together with Amco Asia Corporation\" (Cl. Request for Arb. Exh, II; Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 23).\n\n44.\n\nOn April 25, 1972, the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Public Works, on behalf of the Minister of Public Works, wrote to the Subcommittee Chairman for Foreign Investment of the Foreign Investment Board, referring to the PT Amco letter of April 13, 1972 and stated that \"permission is requested to transfer a portion of the shares held by Amco Asia Corporation to Pan American Development Co Ltd (sic)\", and that the Department of Public Works \"for the time being\" had \"no objection in principle\" to the transfer (Cl. Doc. No. 34).\n\n45.\n\nOn May 1, 1972, the Vice-Chairman of the Sub-Committee for Foreign Investment of the Foreign Investment Board wrote to the Secretary-General of the Department of Public Works to the effect that the Board had \"principally no objection\" to the partial transfer of shares of PT Amco by Amco to Pan American.\n\n46.\n\nBased on this approved transfer, the Tribunal decided, in its Award on Jurisdiction, that it had jurisdiction in respect of Pan American. Accordingly, the present Award on the Merits concerns Pan American as one of the investors.\n\nB. *Evolution of Events Regarding the Leasing, Construction, Managing and Financing of the Kartika Plaza Project*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Phase I*\n------------\n\n47.\n\nAs seen earlier (see para. 11 above), the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement entered into on April 22, 1968 between Amco and PT Wisma, envisaged a two-phase project with regard to the Kartika Plaza: Phase I which was to be a low-rise structure, that is a basement and two floors of what was known as the Annex, which essentially entailed the completion of the structure which the previous owners and developers of the property had started but then abandoned (see para. 9 above); and Phase II was to be a high-rise structure, that is six storeys. Phase I which was to be used for shops and offices and was to be commenced within three months of the approval of Amco\u2019s Investment Application, was to be completed within twelve months of the start of work. Phase II was to be utilized as a \"a hotel and/or apartments\", but would only go ahead if Amco chose to do so, and if Amco did choose to proceed with Phase II, construction thereon was to commence no later than twenty-four months after the completion of Phase I and work on Phase II was to be finished within twenty-four months from the date of the start of work on such second phase (delays due *to force majeure* were to be considered as acceptable delays, thus permitting extensions to the agreed-upon deadlines).\n\n48.\n\nAs it turned out, Amco\u2019s amended Investment Application was approved by the Indonesian Minister of Public Works on July 29, 1968, and accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement, Amco was obligated to commence work on Phase I no later than October 29, 1968 and to complete such phase no later than October 29, 1969, permissible delays excepted.\n\n49.\n\nPhase I was completed before October 29, 1969, and in fact this phase, which was redesigned to include 83 hotel rooms, was officially opened on October 6, 1969 (Cl. Doc. No. 2, at 33).\n\n50.\n\nIn the meantime, in view of the fact that PT Amco was officially and legally established on January 25, 1969 (see para. 40 above), Amco apparently transferred all its rights under the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement to PT Amco in January 1969 (Cl. Statement of Fact and Law, at para. 5a; and Cl. Doc. No. 14, 3rd whereas clause and signature page). While the Tribunal has not seen any direct evidence of such transfer, the point was not disputed by Respondent, and thus the Tribunal, for the purpose of this Award, accepts that such transfer did indeed take place in January, 1969, after PT Amco legally came into existence.\n\n*b) Commencement and enlargement of Phase II*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nIt seems that although the Amco Group contractually had twenty-four months from October, 1969 to decide whether to proceed with Phase II of the Wisma Kartika Project, that is, the six storey high-rise building, they determined much earlier to proceed with this part of the project since, apparently, on November 13, 1968, the Amco Group wrote to PT Wisma reporting that the structural work on the high-rise had already started (Cl. Doc. 4). Moreover, the Amco Group advised PT Wisma, in the same letter of November 13, 1968, that it planned to extend the high-rise to eight storeys instead of building just the six storeys envisaged by the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement. The letter of November 13, 1968, itself was not presented in evidence but was referred to in a letter dated January 24, 1969, from PT Wisma to PT Amco acknowledging receipt thereof and the report of the early commencement of the structural work on the high-rise building and accepting that the new structure would be eight storeys, that is two storeys higher than originally contracted for (Cl. Doc. No. 4).\n\n*c) Extension of the term of the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement to thirty years*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nMoreover, in the letter of January 24, 1969, from PT Wisma to PT Amco referred to in para. 51 above, PT Wisma agreed to extend the term of the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement to thirty years from the twenty year term which had previously been agreed upon (Cl. Doc. Nd. 4).\n\n*d) Relationship with Pulitzer, Garuda, KLM and Aeropacific*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nOn August 22, 1969, PT Amco entered into an Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the \"Sub-Lease Agreement of Intent\"), with Mr Herbert Pulitzer Jr (hereinafter referred to as \"Pulitzer\"), a United States businessman, Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappi NV, the Royal Dutch Airline, commonly known as KLM (hereinafter referred to as \"klm\") and P. M. Garuda Indonesian Airways (hereinafter referred to as \"Garuda\"), the Indonesian national air carrier. For the purpose of the Sub-Lease Agreement of Intent, Pulitzer, Garuda and KLM were acting jointly.\n\n54.\n\nThe Sub-Lease Agreement of Intent stated that Pulitzer had obtained the franchise right to operate hotels in Indonesia from Howard Johnson Motor Lodges, Inc, a company well known in the United States at that time for its food outlets and its hotel and motel chain which it operated under the name of \"Howard Johnson\u2019s Motor Lodges\", and Pulitzer, Garuda and KLM expressed their common intent to establish a company in Indonesia, to acquire from Pulitzer the Howard Johnson hotel franchise. The Indonesian company to be established would be owned 51% by Pulitzer, and 49% by Garuda and KLM between them (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 24).\n\n55.\n\nIt should be noted that in a post-script to the Sub-lease Agreement of Intent, both PT Wisma and Amco approved of and agreed to \"respect\" the terms of the document.\n\n56.\n\nIn view of the fact that as a result of the proposed arrangement between PT Amco and the Pulitzer Group, as envisaged in the Sub-Lease and Management Agreement of Intent, PT Amco was not going to mange the hotel as foreseen in the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement, Amco and PT Wisma signed an addendum to the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement (which addendum was undated but which it seems was signed sometime after the First Sub-Lease Agreement of Intent, as hereinafter defined) setting forth how the profits from the property were to be shared between PT Wisma and Amco (and later PT Amco).\n\n57.\n\nOn October 15, 1969, a Sub-Lease Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the \"First Sub-Lease Agreement\") was entered into between PT Amco, on the one part, and Pulitzer, Garuda and klm, jointly, on the other hand (with Pulitzer/Garuda/KLM \"having the right to assign the rights and obligations\" of the First Sub-Lease Agreement \"to a limited company to be established by these three...\") (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 25).\n\n58.\n\nIn the First Sub-Lease Agreement, Pulitzer, Garuda and KLM expressed their desire \"to manage and to operate the Hotel\", that is the Kartika Plaza Hotel, which was then partially completed with the rest being built by PT Amco, \"under a licence from Howard Johnson\u2019s Motor Lodges, Inc (in the USA)\", and accordingly Pulitzer/Garuda/KLM agreed to sublease the hotel from PT Amco on a net basis (that is, maintenance, repairs, including structural repairs, alterations, certain insurance and taxes were to be for the account of Pulitzer/Garuda/KLM) for a period of thirty years expiring October 1, 1999.\n\n59.\n\nUnder the First Sub-Lease Agreement, Pulitzer/Garuda/KLM were to have \"absolute control and discretion in the use and operation of the hotel, which operation\" was to \"include all activities which are customarily and usually connected with such operation\". The hotel was to bear the name \"Howard Johnson\u2019s Hotel\", although the entire project was to be known as \"Kartika Plaza\".\n\n60.\n\nPulitzer/Garuda/KLM further agreed to guarantee \"credit facilities to any first class bank... in the amount of One million US Dollars as security for a loan in the amount of One million US Dollars to be granted\" by such bank to PT Amco \"in order to enable\" PT Amco \"to complete the construction of the Hotel\" upon the terms and conditions called for in the First Sub-Lease Agreement.\n\n61.\n\nAs with the Sub-Lease Agreement of Intent, PT Wisma and Amco noted in writing their respective approvals of the First Sub-Lease Agreement and their respective agreements to \"respect\" same.\n\n62.\n\nOn October 30, 1969, PT Amco borrowed US $1,000,000 from Algemene Bank Nederland NV, London, England Branch (hereinafter referred to as the \"1969 abn Loan\") Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. Il No. 29). The said loan was to bear interest at 10.5% per annum, and the principal was to be repaid on October 30, 1974. This loan was guaranteed by Pulitzer, Garuda and KLM and was made \"in order to enable\" PT Amco \"to complete the construction of the Hotel\" (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 26 at p. 27). This arrangement was in fulfilment of the obligation of Pulitzer, Garuda and KLM contained in the First Sub-Lease Agreement (see para. 60 above).\n\n63.\n\nA new Sub-Lease Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the \"Second Sub-Lease Agreement\") was signed on October 13, 1970, just under one year from the date of the First Sub-Lease Agreement, because as the Second Sub-Lease Agreement stated: \"disputes and differences have repeatedly arisen... particularly as to whether the standards set by Howard Johnson\u2019s Motor Lodges, Inc have been observed in the erection of the hotel and such disputes have become so acrimonious and time-consuming that it would be impractical to continue with\" the First Sub-Lease Agreement as same was structured and written (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 26).\n\n64.\n\nThe parties to the Second Sub-Lease Agreement were PT Amco, on the one hand, and Aeropacific Hotel Association (hereinafter referred to as \"Aeropacific\", on the other hand. Aeropacific was described as \"a partnership organized and existing under the laws of Indonesia, established and domiciled in Djakarta\", whose partners were stated as being Pulitzer, Garuda and klm, with the said partnership having \"the right and obligation\" to assign and transfer all of its rights and obligations contained in the Second Sublease Agreement to a Persarom Tarbatas (PT), an Indonesian limited liability company, to be established by the three partners.\n\nIt was intended that the Second Sub-Lease Agreement was to supersede and replace all earlier agreements between PT Amco and the Pulitzer/ Garuda/KLM Group in respect to the \"lease and operation\" of the hotel, but the duration of the term was the same as that of the First Sub-Lease Agreement.\n\n65.\n\nAs opposed to the previous arrangements between Amco and the Pulitzer/Garuda/KLM Group according to which Amco was supposed to complete the construction of the hotel, the Second Sub-Lease Agreement called for Aeropacific to \"complete the construction of the Hotel and furnish, equip and fit the same in all respects in accordance with Howard Johnson\u2019s standards...\" and it was to be the responsibility of Aeropacific \"not only to complete the said Hotel but to remedy all defects and defaults therein\". Moreover, Aeropacific agreed that at its own expense it would \"pay all costs, expenses, charges, wages and outgoings of whatever nature incurred... in completing the said Hotel\" to meet the said Howard Johnson\u2019s standards. PT Amco agreed not to interfere with the work of completing the hotel.\n\n66.\n\nThe rental to be paid by Aeropacific was to be much the same as that called for in the First Sub-Lease except that to the gross receipts alternative computation of the rental payable contained in the First Sub-Lease Agreement, 15% of gross receipts from laundry charges, and 25% of gross receipts of swimming pool user charges were to be added.\n\n67.\n\nIn addition, Aeropacific agreed to assume and repay the US $1,000,000 1969 ABN Loan with interest thereon and to obtain a full and complete discharge of PT Amco in connection with same. Indeed Aeropacific did do this and PT Amco was discharged from its liabilities under the 1969 Loan on March 3, 1971 (see attachment to Cl. Exh. 64).\n\n68.\n\nIn consideration of Aeropacific agreeing to undertake the cost of all the further construction and furnishing of the hotel and to fully assume and repay the 1969 abn Loan, Aeropacific was entitled by the Second Sub-Lease Agreement to deduct and withhold from the annual rental payable by it to Amco.50% of such amount for a period of ten years, commencing on October 1, 1970, and ending September 30, 1980.\n\n69.\n\nBecause Aeropacific was not an entity approved under the Foreign Investment Law, it could not import duty free goods, materials, equipment, machinery, furnishing, etc., necessary for the completion of the construction and furnishing of the hotel and thus Annex I to the Second SubLease Agreement contained a description of a mechanism pursuant to which the parties agreed such items would be imported into Indonesia in PT Amco\u2019s name but with Aeropacific acting as PT Amco\u2019s agent under a Power of Attorney. Likewise, PT Amco agreed to open a bank account in its name, as permitted by the Indonesian Foreign Exchange regulations concerning entities which have been established pursuant to the 1967 Foreign Investment, which account was to be separate from PT Amco\u2019s other accounts, \"and all foreign currency brought into the Republic of Indonesia\" by Aeropacific \"for the completion of the Hotel was to be paid into this account\". However, as it will be shown hereunder (see para. 226) this clause was not actually implemented, since only small deposits were made into this account.\n\n70.\n\nOnce more, as in the Sub-Lease Agreement of Intent and the First Sub-Lease Agreement, PT Wisma and Amco approved and agreed in writing to \"respect\" the terms of the Second Sub-Lease Agreement.\n\n71.\n\nThe Indonesian Limited Company, or PT, which Pulitzer, Garuda, KLM and Aeropacific had stated in the Sub-Lease Agreement of Intent, and the First and Second Sub-Lease Agreements they were going to establish was finally constituted under the name PT Aeropacific Hotel Corporation (hereinafter referred to as \"PT Aeropacific\") by Notarial Document on January 27, 1971 and approved by the Indonesian Minister of Justice on November 5, 1971. At the time of incorporation, the stockholders of PT Aeropacific were: Pulitzer\u201451%, klm\u201424.5%, and E. Suherman (as nominee of Garuda)\u201424.5% (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 27). On May 15, 1975, PT Amco and PT Aeropacific agreed to \"consider all rights and obligations of \u2018Aeropacific\u2019 as from the date of \u2018PT Aeropacific\u2019s official recognition\u2019 were \u2018transferred\u2019 to PT Aeropacific\" (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 27).\n\n72.\n\nWithin ten months after the date of the Second Sub-Lease Agreement, PT Aeropacific wrote to PT Amco stating that Howard Johnson\u2019s Motor Lodges, Inc, had informed PT Aeropacific that the former \"will withdraw from South East Asia\", and thus, \"there is not much use in continuing the Licence Agreement\" (between the Aeropacific Group and Howard Johnson\u2019s Motor Lodges, Inc) and accordingly PT Aeropacific was \"compelled to agree with Howard Johnson\u2019s Motor Lodges, Inc to terminate the Licence Agreement as per September 1, 1971\" (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 28).\n\n73.\n\nPT Aeropacific stated in the letter referred to in paragraph 66 above, which was dated August 23, 1971, that PT Aeropacific \"shall continue to maintain and operate the Hotel in accordance with standards which are at least as good as Howard Johnson\u2019s standards\" (Res. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 28). A copy of this letter was sent to PT Wisma.\n\n74.\n\nConstruction of the hotel, which was undertaken since October 13, 1970 by Aeropacific Group continued and by the end of 1971 or early 1972, all eleven floors were built and 331 hotel rooms were available for use (Cl. Doc. 2, p. 34 trans, and Resp. Jones Lang Wootton Report, p. 9). However, the \"Record of Legal Completion of Kartika Plaza Building\" was not signed between PT Wisma, PT Amco and \"Aeropacific Hotel Association (PT Aeropacific Hotel Corporation)\" (sic) until January 7, 1974 and November 24, 1974\" (Cl. Doc. 12). As between PT Amco and PT Wisma a \"Certificate of Completion of Kartika Plaza Building\" was signed on March 23, 1977 (Cl. Doc. 13). This document was also signed by Amco, which was represented for the purpose by Mr Max E. Moore.\n\n75.\n\nFrom the evidence to the Tribunal, it appears that PT Amco complained from time to time about the maintenance standards with respect to the hotel under PT Aeropacific\u2019s management and that rental payments were increasingly late and overdue (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 38, pp. 5-6).\n\n76.\n\nThe uneasy relations between PT Amco and the Aeropacific Group were expanded to affect the PT Wisma/Inkopad Group after meetings between the then Chairman of Inkopad and President-Director of PT Aeropacific on April 5 and 7, 1978 (Cl. Doc. 43).\n\n77.\n\nLegal skirmishing continued in the first few months of 1978 between PT Amco and the Aeropacific Group (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. III Nos 34,35, 36,37, CL Doc. 45) and finally the matter was put to arbitration (Cl. Reply to CM,p. 71 and Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 38), and eventually solved by mutual agreement on March 29, 1980 (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 39) but not before Inkopad itself took over possession and control of the Wisma Kartika property on June 1, 1978 (Cl. Doc. 46, 47 and 48).\n\n78.\n\nFrom June 1, 1978, Inkopad undertook the management of the property. Faced, however, with the difficulties of actually carrying out the management functions with respect to the hotel, shops and offices of the property, without the assistance of professional managers, and with a certain unhappiness with the situation on the part of the Board of Directors of PT Wisma with the manner in which Inkopad took over the management of the property in June, 1978, and Inkopad\u2019s apparent inability to sustain an acceptable standard of management in addition to some lobbying on the part of Messrs Moore and Tan, Inkopad authorized PT Wisma to enter into with PT Amco a \"Profit Sharing Agreement for the Management of the Kartika Plaza Land and Building with All Its Contents at Jalan M. H. Thamrin 10, Jakarta\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"1978 Profit Sharing Agreement\") Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 42) (see para. 81 and following below).\n\nC. *The Events of March 31/April 1, 1980 and Following*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Claimants allege that, on March 31/April 1, 1980, the Indonesian Government \"wrongfully seized\" control and management of the hotel from PT Amco in what was described by Claimants as \"an armed, military action\" (Cl. Request for Arbitration, p. 12, para. 30, and Cl. Statement of Fact and Law, p. 7, para. 11).\n\n80.\n\nWithout, at this point, going into the merits of this allegation, the Tribunal believes it useful to set out what the Tribunal considers to be the series of events leading up to March 31/April 1, 1980 and the occurrences of those dates and following, which give rise to the Claimants\u2019 abovementioned allegation.\n\n81.\n\nThe 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement (see para. 72 above) changed the terms set out in the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement between PT Wisma and Amco (subsequently transferred to PT Amco). Among other things, the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement related in paragraph 2 thereof that \"the management of the Kartika Plaza Land and Building with all its contents shall be carried out, implemented and the full responsibility\" of PT Amco. In addition, the parties agreed that there would no longer be \"the Excluded Areas and that PT Amco was to be charged with the management of the entire property\" that is, the hotel, the offices and shops. A new profit sharing formula was envisaged for the period October 1, 1978 through September 30, 1984 pursuant to which \"the net income\" (as defined in the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement) of the property was to be shared 65% for PT Amco and 35% for PT Wisma. For the period October 1, 1984 through September 30, 1999, the parties were to share the said net income on a 50/50 basis. Paragraph 4 of the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement called for the establishment of a \"Management Consulting Committee\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"mcc\"), to consist of six members, being two representatives each of PT Wisma, PT Amco and Inkopad.\n\n82.\n\nThe mcc was mandated to \"give advice and suggestions\" to IT' Amco with respect to the management of the property. On the other hand, PT Amco was to furnish information to the mcc \"regularly\" and was obliged to \"take cognizance of and consider all advice and suggestions\". The parties undertook that an effort should be made so that all disputes are settled \"directly... between the parties holding high the principle of \"deliberation consensus\" and mutual respect and the goal of secure and orderly business success\". Moreover, the parties stated themselves as being fully cognizant of the obligations which arose from the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement and pledged themselves to work hard to implement it successfully.\n\n83.\n\nUpon resuming the management control of the property, PT Amco looked about to engage professional management for the hotel and in November 1978, hired Mr Richard Horan as General Manager of the hotel (Cl. Reply to CM, p. 66, para. M-1). Mr Horan at one time worked for the Hyatt Hotel in Chicago. He was assisted by one of Mr Tan\u2019s daughters.\n\n84.\n\nAround the same time, that is November or December 1978, PT Amco, through Mr Tan and Mr Moore, began negotiations with the Ramada International Hotel Chain (Cl. Doc. 52), and on July 4, 1979, PT Amco entered into a management agreement and a licence agreement (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Ramada Management Agreements\") with Ramada International Inc and Ramada Inns Inc respectively, both companies being members of the Ramada International Hotel Management Group (hereinafter referred to as \"Ramada\") (Resp. Exh. to CM vol. II No. 43). The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to describe in detail the contents of the Ramada Management Agreements, but suffice it to say that the said Agreements provided for Ramada to furnish to PT Amco management services, including supervision, direction and control of the management and operations of the hotel for a ten year period. Ramada was to select and assign (subject to PT Amco\u2019s prior approval) a general manager for the hotel, although his salary was to be paid by PT Amco.\n\n85.\n\nNo direct evidence was produced to the Tribunal as to what PT Wisma\u2019s reaction was to the Ramada Management Agreements, although it appears that PT Wisma was well aware of this development and did not object to it. Indeed General Karim and Mr Zoelkamain Ali, both PT Wisma appointees to the mcc, attended the signing of the Ramada Management Agreements in Brussels, Belgium on July 4, 1979 (Cl. Reply to CM at 69).\n\n86.\n\nMr Horan resigned as General Manager of the hotel in April 1979, and was replaced by Mr Ali, who carried the title of Acting General Manager (Cl. Reply to CM at 68). Mr Ali himself was replaced in July 1979, by Mr Albertus Salindeho, previously Acting Sales Manager of the hotel (Cl. Reply to CM at 69 and Cl. Doc. 53), but Mr Ali upon learning of his removal, lobbied for his reappointment and effective July 31, 1979, he was appointed (and Mr Ali, in a curious handwritten note written on a notice of his reinstatement, undertook that \"the case to give over (K)artika Plaza to the Army is herewith withdrawn\" (Cl. Reply to CP p. 70 and Cl. Doc. 53). Mr A. J. Schussel, who was selected by Ramada to be the General Manager of the hotel, arrived in Jakarta in November, 1979 (Washington testimony p. 32). His appointment as General Manager was approved by the mcc \"with effect from December 11, 1979\" at a meeting of the mcc held on December 20, 1979 (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. III No. 44), and he received his Indonesian work permit with effect from November 29, 1979 on February 9, 1980 (Cl. Doc. 56).\n\n87.\n\nExcept for their mutual agreement with respect to the Ramada Management Agreements, the Tribunal was not made aware as to what the exact state of the relationship was between PT Wisma and PT Amco during the period October, 1978 through October, 1979. On the other hand, the Tribunal does know that for the period November, 1979 to March 31, 1980, there were a number of matters over which the parties disagreed. These included (i) a desire by PT Wisma to obtain from PT Amco details pertaining to a proposed Rp. 200 million renovation of the hotel; (ii) a desire by PT Wisma to obtain from PT Amco a breakdown regarding the income and expenses for the excluded area of the property and the profit sharing figures in connection therewith; and (iii) (from December, 1979) a desire by PT Wisma for information from PT Amco with regard to the calculation of the profits of the hotel for 1978 and 1979 as well as profit projections for the year 1980 and the amount of the parties respective profit shares for such years; and (iv) the amounts actually distributed to PT Wisma by PT Amco.\n\n88.\n\nIt appears that there were serious disagreements on these issues, particularly item (iii), that is the amounts which the respective parties thought were due by PT Amco to PT Wisma. These issues were raised at the mcc meetings in November and December 1979 (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. IV No. 44) and were the subject of correspondence back and forth between the parties on February 14, 1980 (PT Amco to PT Wisma), March 11, 1980 (PT Wisma to PT Amco), March 12, 1980 (PT Amco to PT Wisma), March 12, 1980 (PT Wisma to PT Amco), March 15, 1980 (PT Amco to PT Wisma), March 19, 1980 (PT Amco to PT Wisma), March 25, 1980 (PT Wisma to PT Amco) (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. III Nos 45-52 and Cl. Doc. 57). The immediate matter upon which there was a failure to agree was the amount of the profit share for the year 1978 and 1979 to which PT Wisma thought it was entitled, PT Wisma taking the position that a balance of Rp. 34,312,175 (US $54,609) was still due to it by PT Amco, and PT Amco, basing itself on its own calculations, maintaining that such sum was not due, although on March 15, 1980, PT Amco cited \"certain problems with accounting technicalities\" for not being in a position to finalize all figures. Moreover, PT Amco acknowledged that it was aware that PT Wisma and Inkopad had the \"impression that there is a certain vagueness with regard to the implementation of the October, 1978 Agreement\", that is, the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement.\n\n89.\n\nAccordingly, in its letter of March 11, 1980 (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. III No. 47) PT Wisma specifically stated that should there be \"no realization (by March 15, 1978) concerning PT Wisma Kartika\u2019s property, we (i.e. PT Wisma) shall consider PT Amco Indonesia to be in default, so that the cooperation contract between us will be null and void and the management of the Hotel Kartika Plaza will be taken over by PT Wisma as the owner\", then on March 25, 1980, PT Wisma again writing to PT Amco, stated \"... and if there has not yet been realization by the date that has been set (i.e. March 30, 1980), then the management of the land and all the Kartika Plaza Building... along with all the contents, will be conducted by PT Wisma Kartika as the owner\" (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. III No. 51). These warnings were made notwithstanding the fact that the Profit Sharing Agreement called for the settlement of disputes \"holding high the principles of deliberation to reach consensus and mutual respect\" (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. II No. 42).\n\n90.\n\nIn the event, PT Amco did not make the full payment of Rp. 34, 312,175 (US $54,609) to PT Wisma by the March 30, 1980 deadline imposed by PT Wisma, although making an \"advance payment\" of Rp. 10,000,000 (see Cl. Doc. 57). On March 31, 1980, the latter wrote to PT Amco noting that PT Amco had not paid the amount PT Wisma expected from \"the proceeds of the management of the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building\" since \"we (i.e. PT Wisma) handed over to you (PT Amco) the responsibility of management\" of the property, and that PT Amco \"did not seriously and honestly manage the Hotel/Building well, so that we (i.e. PT Wisma) are very worried whether we will be able to accept the Hotel/Building later if this cooperative relationship ends\". PT Wisma went on to say that it \"very much doubted\" PT Amco\u2019s \"ability and sincerity to deliver on the responsibility for managing the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building\". \"Therefore\", concluded PT Wisma, \"we as owner of the Kartika Plaza Hotel/Building and land, hereby respectfully inform you (i.e. PT Amco) that as of March 31, 1980 the responsibility for the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building management will return to PT Wisma Kartika and in order to implement management of Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building, the management has formed and appointed a Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building Management Council, which is chaired by Lt. General (Ret.) R. Soerjo\" (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. III No. 52).\n\n91.\n\nIt seems that PT Wisma had not anticipated receiving the sum it had demanded for payment no later than March 30, 1980 by such date, because according to the testimony of Major (Ret.) X who at various times was the security coordinator at the hotel and Mr Y. Z., Major X\u2019s sometimes assistant in security matters, they were present at a meeting held on that date (i.e. March 30, 1980) at the private home in Jakarta of Colonel Soejipto, the Chief Executive Officer of PT Wisma at which meeting the matter of a plan for the retaking of the control of the property by PT Wisma from PT Amco on or about March 31, 1980, was discussed, as were certain related security and management aspects of the plan including the \"backing\" and involvement of certain Indonesian army and police units in the planned take-over (Cl. Docs 96 and 97; Washington testimony at 310-15 and 504-8). Moreover, apparently by at least March 28, 1980, the PT Wisma people were preparing their moves, because Major X testified that he was invited to the meeting at Colonel Soejipto\u2019s home on March 30, 1980, referred to above \"one or two days\" before the meeting actually took place, such invitations having been extended by Mr Zoelkarnain Ali and a PT Wisma lawyer, Mr Anis (Washington testimony, p. 478). Moreover, General Soerjo, a Director of PT Wisma, testified before the Tribunal that it was on the evening of March 28, 1980 that he signed the letter from PT Wisma to PT Amco which letter was subsequently dated March 31, 1980, in which PT Wisma informed PT Amco that PT Wisma was taking back control of the Wisma Kartika property (see para. 90 above) (Washington Testimony, at 571-2, 590-1).\n\n92.\n\nOn March 31, 1980, coinciding with its letter of the same date to PT Amco, which letter is referred to above, Colonel Soejipto, Chief Executive of PT Wisma, issued a \"Decree or Letter of Decision\" which had as its subject matter \"Re: Formation and Appointment of Management Council of Building/Hotel Kartika Plaza...\" (Cl. Documentary Submissions in Support of Rejoinder to Resp. Observations on Jurisdiction No. 89). This document citing the necessity to provide for the management of the Kartika Plaza facility in \"a healthy and honest manner\" announced the creation of a Management Council of six persons, to be chaired by Lt. General R. Soerjo. The Council, according to the Decree/Letter of Decision, was to be given the \"fullest authorization to manage (the property) and to achieve the best possible result\" in such endeavour. This decision became effective, in accordance with its terms, on March 31, 1980 at 8 a.m.\n\n93.\n\nAccordingly, it appears that from March 31, 1980, PT Wisma considered that it had taken the control and management of the hotel from PT Amco, with the latter not having any further role to play in connection with the property. On that date a notice was issued by the Directors of PT Wisma, to \"All Manager and Department Heads of Hotel Kartika Plaza and the Excluded Areas\", regarding the question of \"Responsibility for Management of the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building\", in which the Directors of PT Wisma stated:\n\nHerewith we notify you that as of March 31, 1980 the responsibility for the management of the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building, including the Excluded Area, is to be carried out by PT Wisma Kartika. To this effect, the Directors (of PT Wisma) have formed and appointed the Management Council of the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building, which is headed by Lt. General (Ret.) R. Soerjo.\n\nThe staff was requested \"to work as usual and to be responsible to the Management Council\".\n\n94.\n\nThere is some contradictory evidence as to when certain events occurred on March 31 and/or April 1, 1980. For example, it seems that a meeting of the managers and the department heads of the hotel took place at 9 a.m. in the Tiara Room of the hotel on 31 March, 1980. This meeting was apparently called by Colonel Soejipto of PT Wisma and was chaired by General Soerjo. Colonel Soejipto was present. Mr A. J. Schussel, the then General Manager of the hotel was not present because, according to General Soerjo, \"he did not show up\". Mr Schussel in his testimony stated he never received a notice of such meeting and was not aware of its occurrence. In any event, the said meeting was apparently very brief with the new PT Wisma-appointed Management Council representatives reiterating what was already set out in the Decree or Letter of Decision referred to earlier (see para. 92 above).\n\n95.\n\nThere is further ambiguity regarding Mr Schussel\u2019s activities on either March 31 or April 1. In his testimony before the Tribunal, Mr Schussel stated that he knew nothing about any PT Wisma activities regarding the take-over of the hotel until the morning of April 1, yet there was placed in evidence a copy of a memorandum dated April 2, 1980, signed by Djamaani Gumay, then Chief of Security of the hotel, which stated that at a meeting of the Senior Managers of the hotel held in the afternoon of March 31, 1980, Mr Schussel, who chaired the meeting according to the memorandum, asked his staff to cooperate with the PT Wisma newly appointed Management Council, in the interest of the continued smooth operation of the hotel (Resp. Exh. vol. VI No. 135). Mr Schussel himself recalled that the meeting at which he made such an appeal to his staff (and he further testified that he made such an appeal only once), took place in the afternoon of April 1, 1980. The Tribunal gives weight to this latter version of events because Mr Schussel in his testimony concerning this meeting testified that during the course of the meeting at which he asked his staff to cooperate with the mcc, a Mr Tjengri, an employee of PT Amco \"came in to deliver a notice that the meeting was illegal\" (Washington testimony, at 102). A copy of this notice, which was signed by E. M. Tomodok, Vice-Chairman of PT Amco was submitted to the Tribunal as an exhibit (Resp. Exh. vol. VI No. 124). It was dated April 1, 1980 and addressed to \"all employees of Kartika Plaza Hotel, with respect to the invitation to attend a briefing by those calling themselves the Management Committee of Wisma Kartika today April 1, 1980, to be held in the Tiara Room at 15:00...\". The notice went on to state that PT Amco was entitled to manage the hotel, and accordingly the PT Wisma-appointed Management Committee was not entitled to exercise any management function. Moreover, the notice went on, no permission to utilize the Tiara Room had been given by PT Amco and that all employees should not attend the briefing to be held that day, which according to the notice was \"an illegal action\". Mr Yan Apul, attorney to PT Amco during this period of time, in an Affidavit presented to the Tribunal (Cl. Doc. 98) claims that he went to the hotel at 11:00 a.m. on April 1, 1980 \"at the request of Mr Tjengri\" who told him that \"the Armed Forces had seized the Hotel\".\n\n96.\n\nThe same kind of contradiction arises as to when Mr Schussel met with General Soerjo, the Chairman of the PT Wisma-appointed Management Council. According to General Soerjo, he first met with Mr Schussel in General Soerjo\u2019s office at PT Wisma in the afternoon of March 31, 1980. According to General Soerjo, it was at this time that the General made an offer to Mr Schussel to remain as General Manager of the hotel, but was told by Mr Schussel that the latter would have to check the situation first with Ramada headquarters in Brussels. The next morning, according to General Soerjo, after having met with Mr Schussel a second time and Mr Schussel having advised him that he had had no news, one way or another, from Ramada in Brussels, General Soerjo told Mr Schussel that he would dismiss him from his post as General Manager until such time that Mr Schussel could give the General a definitive answer on the post of General Manager.\n\n97.\n\nThe testimony of Mr Schussel, on the other hand, was that it was only when he went down to the lobby of the hotel at about 9.00 a.m. on April 1, 1980, did he learn and become aware of the take-over. Then, after first visiting the offices of PT Amco in the Wisma Kartika to determine what was going on, and where he learned of PT Wisma\u2019s take-over of the property, he i.e. Mr Schussel, proceeded to General Soerjo\u2019s private office in the building for what according to Mr Schussel was his first meeting with the General. In fact, Mr Schussel\u2019s description of what was said at the meeting did not vary materially with that given by General Soerjo.\n\n98.\n\nIn any event, Mr Schussel was \"relieved of his duties as General Manager of Hotel Kartika Plaza\", and replaced as \"Caretaker General Manager\" by Mr H. Soejipto \"effective April 1, 1980\" according to an interoffice memorandum signed by General Soerjo on April 1, 1980 (Resp. Exh. vol. VI No. 124).\n\n99.\n\nWhen and how Mr Schussel, the General Manager of the hotel actually first found out about the take-over of the hotel by PT Wisma also points up certain differences in the factual picture presented to the Tribunal of events surrounding the presence of and the role played by members of the Indonesia armed forces on April 1, 1980 and following.\n\n100.\n\nAs stated above, Mr Schussel testified that when he went down from his living quarters on the seventh floor of the hotel at about 9:00 a.m. on April 1, 1980, he had no idea of the events which were in train. When the elevator in which he was riding from his living quarters opened into the lobby of the hotel on that morning, he saw a number (\"up to perhaps two dozen\") of Indonesian armed forces personnel in and about the building. Some were, according to him, army personnel and some police personnel. Some were dressed in \"green uniforms\" and at least one was wearing a \"red beret\". All were armed, although none of the arms were unholstered, and thus were not \"at the ready\". According to Mr Schussel, the armed forces personnel were located in various positions in the hotel including the lobby, various corridors and guarding certain stairways and offices. There were also uniformed armed forces personnel present, according to Mr Schussel when he met with General Soerjo, on the morning of April 1, 1980 (although this was denied by the General in his own testimony before the Tribunal). Mr Schussel concluded that the armed forces personnel were in the hotel in support of the take-over.\n\n101.\n\nThe fact that there were members of the Indonesian armed forces was corroborated by police Major (Ret.) X, who at one time was the Chief of Security at the hotel and who, after having been laid off from the hotel in January 1980, was asked by the PT Wisma-appointed Management Council to return to the hotel on April 1, 1980, as Security Coordinator, and by Mr Y. Z., his assistant. Both filed affidavits in this case and provided oral testimony before the Tribunal that they were aware that even before the events of March 31/April 1, there were approximately ten armed forces personnel already living in rooms in the hotel in anticipation of the events of March 31/April 1. These people, according to Messrs X and Y. Z. were given rooms in the hotel by Colonel Soejipto of PT Wisma a day or two before the take-over of the hotel. Both Messrs X and Y. Z. testified that on the morning of April 1, 1980, they saw approximately ten Indonesian armed forces personnel present in the hotel, all armed and functioning as \"pacifiers\" of the situation as it was put in testimony. Personnel belonging to a police unit (Kodak) were identified and named, as were members of a military police unit and members of an army unit (Kodim). According to Respondent\u2019s Exhibit 237, a \"Letter of Order to Duty\", five members of the City of Jakarta Metropolitan Police Resort Command Metro 71 were dispatched \"to carry out security at Hotel Kartika Plaza in connection to (sic) the dispute which has occurred\". Major Jaffar, an active army Red Beret Unit officer, who was in a pre-retirement phase-down period, was visible in uniform in the lobby of the hotel. Major Djamaani, an active officer, subject to Inkopad command, and who had acted for some months as the hotel\u2019s security officer, was also present. On the other hand, Witnesses Sgt Sugiono, Harsuno, Nikijusu and Orah, presented by Respondent, all testified that they saw no armed forces personnel in uniform in the hotel, and some said they saw no armed forces personnel at all on the hotel premises, whereas Mr Apul, attorney for Claimants, stated in the Affidavit that when he arrived at the hotel at about 11.00 a.m. April 1, 1980, there were uniformed armed forces personnel present (Cl. Doc. 98). However, the Tribunal notices that Counsel for Respondent admitted in oral argument that there were military and police personnel on the premises of the hotel, while stating that said personnel were there in order to keep peace.\n\n102.\n\nThe PT Wisma-appointed Management of the property was busy consolidating its position during this time. Mr Tjengri, the PT Amco employee who had distributed PT Amco\u2019s circular decrying the alleged illegality of PT Wilma\u2019s activities on April 1, 1980, was told he could only continue to occupy his room if he paid for it (allowing for a 30% discount) (Resp. Exh. vol. VI No. 122). The hotel comptroller was ordered to hand over the key to the hotel safe deposit (Resp. Exh. vol. VI No. 123). The general cashier of the hotel was instructed to turn over funds in the hotel safe to the comptroller (Resp. Exh. vol. VI No. 126). The front office cashier was changed (Resp. Exh. vol VI No. 128). Employees concerned with the excluded areas were taken under the control and supervision of PT Wisma (Resp. Exh. vol. VI No. 129).\n\n103.\n\nPT Amco took also certain actions; it sent notices to all office tenants to continue to pay rent to PT Amco. PT Amco\u2019s lawyer, Mr Yan Apul, visited the hotel on April 1, 1980 and after conferring with his clients, wrote a letter of protest to the armed forces and Ministry of Defence (see para. 95 above; CL Doc. 98 and Resp. Exh. to CM, No. 53). These letters prompted counter-letters from PT Wisma.\n\n104.\n\nThere then ensued a period of what might be described as a kind of cold war which reigned between the parties. From time to time, a PT Amco (which incidentally kept its offices in the building throughout the period of the dispute until October, 1980, although the Claimants alleged that most, if not all, of its records appear to have been taken and never accounted for) employee would carry out a harassing manoeuvre or two, the front appeared to move to the negotiating table. On or about April 12, 1980, Inkopad tried to bring about a reconciliation of the parties but the die had been cast, and reconciliation could not be achieved.\n\n105.\n\nIn the meantime, PT Wisma, on April 11 and 14, 1980, made certain allegations about PT Amco\u2019s investment licence obligations to the Foreign Investment Board (see paras 110-30 below) and on April 24, 1980, commenced a court action in the Central Jakarta District Court to sanction with respect of its activities of March 31/April 1 and thereafter (see paras 110-30 and paras 131-41 below).\n\n106.\n\nThroughout this period, Indonesian armed forces personnel continued to be present at the hotel.\n\n107.\n\nThis state of affairs continued until May 24, 1980, when in what appears to have been an attempt by PT Amco to regain physical control of the hotel, Mr Tjengri, the PT Amco employee and loyalist, burst into the hotel\u2019s front office, sometime around 1:00 p.m. and took possession of the hotel master key, proclaiming to one and all that PT Amco had thus regained possession, control and management of the hotel.\n\n108.\n\nAt about the same time, notices signed by Mr Tomodock, the interim General Manager of the hotel appointed by PT Amco, and also PT Amco\u2019s Vice-Chairman, announcing PT Amco\u2019s redemption of the hotel from PT Wisma, were posted in various departments of the hotel. This action obviously alarmed PT Wisma and after having attempted through Major X the security coordinator, to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the incident, PT Wisma called upon the armed forces for assistance, and who according to all accounts arrived at the hotel in the late afternoon of May 24, 1980, in numbers and in uniform. They then took representatives of both parties to headquarters where the issues were thrashed out and with finally Mr Tjengri surrendering the master key to the armed forces, which in turn passed them to PT Wisma. A couple of days later, officers of PT Amco, Mr and Mrs Gumillag, were put under control of an army intelligence unit while the latter investigated what had happened at the hotel during the period March 30/April 1 - May 24, 1980.\n\n109.\n\nIt should be noted that some members of the armed forces remained in the hotel until October, 1980, at which time it was decided that they were no longer required and they were returned to their respective units.\n\nD. *Revocation of the Licence*\n------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nAs stated earlier (see para. 105 above), one of the steps taken by PT Wisma, after it took over control and management of the Kartika Plaza property on March 31/April 1, 1980, was to report certain information to the Indonesian Capital Investment Coordinating Board, commonly known in Indonesia as \"BKPM\" after the first initials of each of the words of its name in Indonesian, that is Bodan Koordinasi Penannanam Modal, (hereinafter referred to as \"BKPM\" or \"Capital Investment Coordinating Board\", BKPM is the body in Indonesia which is responsible for, among other things, first examining applications by foreign investors in Indonesia and making recommendations to the Indonesian Government in regard to such applications, as well as the supervision and surveillance of the implementation of such foreign investments after they have been approved.\n\n111.\n\nShortly after April 1, 1980, General Soerjo, as mentioned earlier, a director of PT Wisma, and the Chairman of the then newly constituted PT Wisma-appointed Management Council of the Wisma Kartika property, accompanied by Mr Zoelkarnain Ali visited the offices of BKPM (Washington testimony, at 600).\n\n112.\n\nThe first meeting at BKPM held by the PT Wisma representatives was with the Chairman of BKPM. It was held in the morning of April 12, 1980 (Washington testimony of Mr Usman, p. 1228). They, that is the PT Wisma representatives, reported to the BKPM that they suspected that there were certain \"irregularities\" with the Amco Group\u2019s investment in Indonesia (Washington, testimony of General Soerjo, at 602, 614). Among the allegations made was that funds which were supposed to be invested in the hotel were transferred by the Amco Group out of Indonesia to Hong Kong. Likewise, photos of the then physical state of the Kartika Plaza property were shown to the Chairman of BKPM (Washington testimony of General Soerjo, at 615).\n\n113.\n\nThe second meeting at BKPM held by the PT Wisma representatives was with the Bureau Chief of the Directing, Implementation and Control Bureau of BKPM, Mr Ridho Harun, and Mr Usman, who was Chief of the Divisions of Mining and Service Industries at BKPM and Mr Harun\u2019s subordinate. At this second meeting which was held in the afternoon of April 12, 1980, PT Wisma was represented by Mr Zoelkarnain Ali and a lawyer, Mr Azwar Karim (Washington testimony, at 1228).\n\n114.\n\nAt the meeting Messrs Ali and Karim described some of the allegations against Amco/PT Amco and submitted a letter dated April 11, 1980, from the Board of Directors of PT Wisma putting in writing some of said allegations (Washington testimony of Mr Usman, pp. 1229-30 and Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. IV No. 87, para. 1). Apparently, this letter, which was not produced as evidence before the Tribunal, was not considered to be sufficient because on April 14, 1980, PT Wisma addressed another letter to the Chairman of BKPM headed \"Re: PT Amco Indonesia\" (Washington testimony of Mr Usman, pp. 1229-30 and Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. IV No. 87) (see para. 117 below).\n\n115.\n\nFollowing the meeting in the afternoon of April 12, 1980 between Messrs Ali and Karim, representing PT Wisma, and Messrs Harun and Usman of BKPM, Mr Usman did some checking with Bank of Indonesia and the Indonesian tax authorities (Washington testimony of Mr Usman, pp. 1270-75). One could also deduct from this testimony, although not very clearly, that both of these institutions at some time sent documents to Mr Usman, but in the case of the tax department, Mr Usman testified that his subsequent report was based on a personal visit on April 12 or 13, 1980 to the tax department and his sighting PT Amco\u2019s file there (Washington testimony of Mr Usman, at 1273). There was no evidence that Mr Usman visited Bank Indonesia.\n\n116.\n\nOn April 13, 1980, representatives of PT Amco, Mr Tomodock and Mr Gumillag met Messrs Harun and Usman of BKPM at the BKPM offices. During the meeting, which lasted about one hour the PT Amco representatives showed certain documents to the BKPM officials. These documents were not presented as evidence before the Tribunal nor described to it (Washington testimony of Mr Usman, at 1230).\n\n117.\n\nAs mentioned above (see para. 114 above), on April 14, 1980, PT Wisma addressed a letter to BKPM on the subject of \"Re: PT Amco Indonesia\". This six page letter in Indonesian was accompanied by twelve enclosures each of which was referred to in the text of the letter. The letter reviewed what PT Wisma saw as the chain of events and relevant documents regarding the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement, the involvement of the Aeropacific Group, including the US $1,000,000 1969 Loan arrangement, the manner in which goods and equipment were allegedly bought, paid for and brought into the country, the accounting treatment of such transactions in the PT Amco financial statements, and concluded that (a) PT Amco had failed to meet its investment obligations under the Investment Licence and the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement; (b) the accounting treatment in PT Amco\u2019s financial statements of the US $1,000,000 1969 abn Loan was misleading insofar as it purported to represent \"fresh capital abroad\"; (c) payments for imported goods came from Indonesian operations and not from overseas funds; (d) significant sums were transferred abroad and \"never reported and without the knowledge\" of Bank Indonesia, BKPM and PT Wisma; (e) PT Amco was \"unwilling to submit to PT Wisma its periodical reports concerning the proceeds of lease of rooms and shops\"; (f) goods imported by PT Amco from Hong Kong were inflated; (g) PT Amco in 1973 participated in a fictitious loan from Pan American, and treated same in PT Amco\u2019s books in such a way as \"to deceive the Government\"; (h) certain payments by PT Amco to Yee On Hong, a Hong Kong company, were really payments of debts due by Pan American to Yee On Hong, and other allegations of a similar nature. PT Wisma concluded that:\n\nwe also request you (i.e. BKPM) to revoke immediately PT Amco\u2019s licence, because we have suffered so many losses because of it and feel it is very difficult to cooperate with them and besides that, considering also that their very small capital has been retransferred double to abroad (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. IV No. 87).\n\n118.\n\nOn April 15, 1980, three days after the allegations were presented by PT Wisma to BKPM for the first time, and one day after receiving the detailed allegations in the form of the April 4, 1980 letter and enclosures from PT Wisma (see para. 117 above), Mr Usman of BKPM prepared a three page document in Indonesian entitled \"Summary of PT Amco Indonesia - PT Wisma Kartika\". In his Summary, Mr Usman referred to the amended Investment Application but only stated that it was submitted on May 6, 1967 (sic) and that KT Amco \"in a broad sense would engage in the field of real estate, including hotel business\". No mention was made of the amount or schedule of payment with regard to the foreign capital obligations of Amco (Resp. Exh. of CM, vol. IV No. 88).\n\n119.\n\nThen Mr Usman referred to the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement and the obligations of the Amco Group to build the Wisma Kartika complex, and the capital investment committed by the Amco Group pursuant to the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement. Mr Usman repeated the same formulation as that contained in the PT Wisma letter of April 14, 1980, in that he stated that the amount committed by the Amco Group in the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement was US $4,000,000 consisting of equity of US $3,000,000 and loan of US $1,000,000. (It should be noted here that the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement states that the foreign investor\u2019s obligation to invest was \"up to US $1,000,000\" in loans). Mr Usman then stated the facts about PT Amco\u2019s establishment and then went on to say: \"since it turned out that PT Amco Indonesia was not able to fulfil its obligations as provided\" in the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement, PT Amco entered into the First and Second Sub-Lease Agreements with the Aeropacific Group. Reference was then made to the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement between PT Amco and PT Wisma.\n\n120.\n\nMr Usman then stated the \"problem\" as he saw it:\n\nThe management of Hotel Kartika Plaza Building was taken over by PT Wisma Kartika because PT Amco Indonesia did not meet the provisions in the Lease and Management Contract of the year 1968, and the Agreement of 1979 (sic) (although by this, Mr Usman was obviously referring to the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement), and also violations of Public Law.\n\nWhich \"Public Laws\" were violated, Mr Usman, at this point, did not say, he then went on to give a clarification of what took place in regard to the Amco Group\u2019s investment in Indonesia, basing himself entirely on \"the meeting with representatives of PT Wisma Kartika on April 12, 1980 at the office of BKPM\" at which \"the occurrence of the above problem was explained...\" In his Summary Mr Usman did not say whether he spoke with/or visited Bank of Indonesia and/or the Indonesian tax authorities. His assessment of the facts, according to his report, was based solely on April 12, 1980 \"meetings\" with PT Wisma representatives. Furthermore, nothing was said about PT Amco\u2019s side of the story or about his meeting with the PT Amco representatives on April 13, 1980.\n\n121.\n\nMr Usman concluded:\n\nBased on the above facts it can be concluded that PT Amco Indonesia has committed violations towards the administrative provisions of the capital investment (law) in the form of: 1\u2014did not fulfil the invest(ment) as had been agreed upon by the Government; 2\u2014it has acknowledged a loan as equity; 3\u2014 it did not send report(s) to Bank Indonesia concerning the transfer(s) abroad; *4* \u2014within 5 years, it did not forward report(s) to BKPM on the realization of (its) capital investment; 5\u2014it did not report on the execution of the Sub-Lease Agreement by PT Amco Indonesia to BKPM, and (in) this case it also means that PT Amco Indonesia did not manage the project by itself. Besides that, PT Amco Indonesia has also committed violations which have criminal characteristics in the form of: 1\u2014committing tax manipulation in the sense it did not pay tax as it should as had been assessed; 2\u2014giving as guarantee the assets owned by the hotel, for obtaining (a) loan, without the approval of the owner (PT Wisma Kartika).\n\n122.\n\nFinally, Mr Usman stated that:\n\nbased on the above conclusion, it is suggested, it is necessary to review the Foreign Capital Investment Licence which had been granted to PT Amco Indonesia considering that the continuity of PT Amco Indonesia no longer brings about a benefit for the national interests.\n\n123.\n\nMr Usman\u2019s Summary which by its terms did not carry with it any supporting documentation, was given to his Bureau Chief, Mr Ridho Harun, who as was already stated above, was present at a meeting with Messrs Ali and Karim at BKPM in the afternoon of April 12, 1980.\n\n124.\n\nOn May 10, 1980, Mr Ridho Harun of BKPM sent a memorandum to the Deputy Chairman of the BKPM on the subject of \"Violations Executed by PT Amco Indonesia\" (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. IV No. 89). In this seven paragraph memorandum, Mr Harun repeated substantially Mr Usman\u2019s statements. He added, however, that \"a complaint for a criminal process was lodged with the Attorney General on the matter\".\n\n125.\n\nOn May 12, 1980, the Chairman of BKPM, who also was the secretary to the Cabinet, wrote to the President of the Republic of Indonesia on the subject of \"the Problem of PT Amco Indonesia (pma)\" asking whether the President \"can extend an approval to the Capital Investment Corporation Board to issue a decision concerning the termination of (the) capital investment of said company\" (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. IV No. 90).\n\n126.\n\nIn a short \"Request for Guidance\", the Chairman of BKPM stated that PT Amco \"was formed in the framework of Law No, 1 of the year 1967 concerning Foreign Capital Investment, based on the Lease and Management Contract between PT Wisma Kartika and Amco Corporation (of the) USA on the 22nd day of April 1968\". The Request goes on to cite the Amco Foreign Investment Approval, the establishment of PT Amco and that \"the position of Amco Asia Corporation... in the Lease and Management Contract was taken over by PT Amco Indonesia\". The obligations of the Amco Group, according to the Request were to complete construction of the project within the fixed time schedule; to provide hotel equipment; (and) to invest capital amounting to US $4,000,000 consisting of own capital (equity)\u2014US $3,000,000 and loan capital from abroad\u2014US $1,000,000. (Again, no reference was made to Amco\u2019s investment obligations according to its Investment Licence, reference only being made to the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement, which references were not accurate). The Request reiterated an allegation contained in Mr Usman\u2019s Summary (see para. 119 above) that \"PT Amco Indonesia was not able to fulfil its obligation\" under the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement and for this reason entered into the second Sub-Lease Agreement with the Aeropacific Group (no mention being made of the fact that this Agreement was made with the full knowledge, acknowledgement and approval of PT Wisma). Reference was also made to the \"March 31, 1980\" take-over by PT Wisma of the management of the hotel from PT Amco:\n\nsince PT Amco Indonesia has violated the capital investment administrative regulations/provisions in the form of: a. it did not meet the capital deposit approved by the Government; b. the condition of the hotel became more deteriorated and the amount of room dwindled... thus indicating that PT Amco did not make a \u2018replacement\u2019 of those rooms, which means that it did not fulfil its obligations as provided in the Lease and Management Contract; c. acknowledgement of loan as equity (own capital); d. did not forward financial report to Bank Indonesia concerning transfer (of funds) abroad; e. within the last five years, did not forward a report concerning the realization of capital investment (Report A) to the BKPM on the execution of a Sub-Lease Agreement, and this also means that PT Amco Indonesia did not manage the building/hotel Kartika Plaza by itself, besides that, PT Amco Indonesia also committed violation(s) with criminal elements, i.e. in the form of: committing tax manipulations in the sense that it did not pay taxes as it has been assessed; b. to extend as guarantee the property of the hotel in order to obtain a loan, without approval of the owner (PT Wisma Kartika).\n\nThese allegations were a combination of those contained in the Usman and Ridho Reports. Lastly, the Request to the President, which requested approval for BKPM to revoke PT Amco\u2019s licence, echoing a phrase in Mr Usman\u2019s Report stated that by committing the \"legal violations\" referred to above, \"the presence of PT Amco Indonesia in the framework of foreign capital investment does not seem to be profitable any more for national development\".\n\n127.\n\nThe President of the Republic of Indonesia approved the revocation/termination of PT Amco\u2019s Investment Licence and this was conveyed in a letter of the Minister/State Secretary dated May 30, 1980 (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. IV No. 91, para. 6).\n\n128.\n\nOn July 9, 1980, the acting Chairman of BKPM issued a decision \"concerning Revocation of Approval/Termination of Capital Investment Business in the Name of PT Amco Indonesia in the Framework of Law Number 1 year 1967 Concerning Foreign Capital Investment (pma)\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Revocation\" (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. IV No. 91).\n\n129.\n\nThe Revocation began by first taking into consideration that PT Amco was \"established... in the framework of Law No. 1 concerning Foreign Capital Investment to execute a Lease and Management Contract in the field of operating Hotel Kartika Plaza between PT Wisma Kartika and Amco Corporation, USA, dated April 22, 1968\". The Revocation went on to say that because PT Amco \"delivered the management of Hotel Kartika Plaza to PT Aeropacific Hotel Corp.\" pursuant to the First and Second SubLease Agreements, \"therefore it is not PT Amco Indonesia which fulfilled the obligations as stipulated\" in the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement. Also, the Revocation stated that the audited financial statements of PT Amco showed that the company had only:\n\ndeposit(ed) its capital... in the amount of US $1,399,000 which consisted of (a) loan for the amount of US $1,000,000 and own capital (equity) for the sum of US $399,000, whereas according to the Lease and Management Contract and its Foreign Capital Investment Application, PT Amco is obliged to invest its capital in the amount of US $4,000,000, which consisted of own capital (equity) at the sum of $3,000,000 and (a) loan for US $1,000,000, and that the fulfilment of the remainder of the capital was executed by PT Aeropacific Hotel Corporation, an Indonesia Company, therefore the said capital is not foreign capital (fresh capital) is stipulated in Article 2, Law No. 1, Year 1967.\n\n130.\n\nThe Revocation then pronounced the \"Revocation/Annulment\" of the approval given by the President of the Republic of Indonesia \"dated May 18, 1968\" (sic) (see paras 31 and 32 above) which according to the Revocation \"was granted to PT Amco Indonesia in the field of management of Hotel Kartika Plaza in the framework of Law No. 1 Year 1967 concerning Foreign Capital Investment\". The Revocation then went on to say that as a result of the revocation/annulment referred to in the previous sentence, the \"revocation/annulment of licences and tax facilities\" also resulted, and \"all facilities which have been granted (enjoyed)\" in the Foreign Capital Investment Law framework had \"to be returned to the Government\". The Revocation came into force on July 9, 1980.\n\nE. *The Indonesian Court Proceedings*\n-------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nOn April 24, 1980, PT Wisma, as Plaintiff, filed a suit against PT Amco, as Defendant, making reference to the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement of April 22, 1968, the amendment thereto of May 19, 1968 and the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement of October 6, 1978, between PT Wisma and PT Amco as well as to the amended Foreign Investment Application of PT Amco and the Investment Licence issued pursuant thereto. The suit alleged that according to the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement, the \"Overseas Partner\", as therein defined, undertook to \"invest up to the sum of US $4,000,000\" in the Wisma Kartika project, with \"up to US $1,000,000 being invested for completion of the Annex\" that is the first phase and \"up to the sum of US $3,000,000\" for the second phase. Moreover, according to the suit, in the \"Defendant\u2019s application to the Government for a foreign capital investment permit\", Defendant declared that the entire capital of Defendant constituted assets which were specifically allocated and/or set aside for the requirement of establishing Defendant's Company in Indonesia. (One should notice that it was Amco which was the Applicant for the \"foreign investment permit\", not the Defendant, PT Amco).\n\n132.\n\nThe suit alleged that \"it is evident that since the Foreign Capital Investment permit was issued... Defendant (i.e. PT Amco) has neglected to perform its obligations, having deposited on (sic) US $1,399,000...\" and \"it is evident Defendant introduced capital of only US $983,992.65...\" Moreover, according to the complaint, \"it is evident that Defendant transferred money abroad from June 1969 through the end of 1978 in the amount of US $2,677,636.22... without the knowledge of Plaintiff or the approval of the Government\" in breach of BKPM Decree of August 1, 1974 and Defendant allegedly \"never carried... out\" certain alleged periodic reporting requirements \"to the BKPM and Bank of Indonesia concerning the Realization of Foreign Capital Investment... thus\", according to PT Wisma \"violating the provisions set down by the Government\" for the regulation of foreign investment in Indonesia *\"according to which Defendant's operating licence can be revoked by the Government\"* (emphasis not added). In addition, according to PT Wisma\u2019s allegations, \"it is clear that through March 31, 1980 Defendant did not fulfil its promises\" (i.e. of making \"hundreds of millions of Rupiahs\" of repairs to the hotel), so Plaintiff (i.e. PT Wisma) took back the management of the Hotel Kartika Plaza. One other specific allegation made by PT Wisma was that PT Amco \"without the approval or knowledge of Plaintiff, put up Plaintiff\u2019s property (a generator set) as collateral without the approval of Plaintiff\u2019, citing as evidence a letter dated November 29, 1979 from PT Amco to Bank Bali (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. III No. 55). In summary, the Plaintiff alleged that PT Amco (1) committed \"violation(s) of the Foreign Capital Investment Law\"; (2) committed \"embezzlement of Plaintiff's property, i.e. the generating set worth Rp. 60,000,000.00\" and (3) \"did not fulfil the promises agreed to\n\n133.\n\nThe suit then concluded by asking the Central Jakarta District Court to (1) rescind the 1968 Management and Lease Agreement, its amendment of May 19, 1968 and the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement; (2) condemn PT Amco to pay \"compensation in the amount of Rp. 6,030,661,657.18\" or US $9,726,873.64 (rate US $1.00 / Rp. 620) (calculated as follows: Rp. 799,341,657.18 which was grossed-up for inflation by 23% figure of a Rp. 649,871,266 estimated by First National Adjust Company of Jakarta on May 16, 1979 as an amount which was required to put the hotel \"in good condition\" (Resp. Exh. to CM. vol. II No. 41), *plus* Rp. 1,231,320,000 in respect of rent \"which should have been received for 10 more years, if the hotel were in good condition\", *plus* Rp. 1,000,000,000 for \"rent which should have been received for 10 more years if the shops/offices were in good condition\", *plus* Rp. 3,000,000 \"because Kartika Plaza has been defamed at home and abroad, because of mismanagement\". In addition, PT Wisma asked the Court to determine in an interlocutory decree that:\n\nPT Wisma Kartika\u2019s management of Hotel Kartika Plaza is sanctioned under the law and can be priorly executed, even though there is an appeal or some other legal action. This is to avoid greater loss to Plaintiff. It is requested that while the case is in process, the management currently being carried out by the Plaintiff be legalized or at least approved by the court.\n\n134.\n\nThis suit was not notified or served upon PT Amco until May 30, 1980. But on May 28, 1980, that is, more than one month after the suit was originally filed and two days before PT Amco received first word of the case, the Central Jakarta District Court granted *ex parte* PT Wisma\u2019s request for an interlocutory decree giving PT Wisma permission to manage the Kartika Plaza property pending the final outcome of the suit, but ordered PT Wisma to make a monthly accounting of its management.\n\n135.\n\nOn June 2, 1980, PT Amco filed a Request for Postponement of Implementation of the Interlocutory Decree, and on July 8, 1980, the greater Jakarta Court, the Appellate Court, granted PT Amco\u2019s Request. PT Wisma on July 28, 1980 stating that \"on 9 July, 1980, the BKPM revoked the agreement/ended the capital investment venture in the name of PT Amco Indonesia\" appealed this judgment asking the Indonesian Supreme Court \"not to implement the July 8, 1980 Appellate Court decision\" and thus in effect asking for reinstatement of the interlocutory permission granted to PT Wisma to manage the hotel pending the outcome of the case on the merits. On August 4, 1980 the Supreme Court reversed the Appeal Court\u2019s judgment and reinstated the latter. The Supreme Court cited two reasons for its judgment: one, at the time of PT Wisma\u2019s filing the suit i.e. April 24, 1980, PT Amco \"was no longer managing the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building\" and \"therefore (the) interlocutory decree... in fact strengthened temporarily the legal condition in which PT Wisma Kartika had been managing the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building\"; and the second reason was that BKPM had on July 9, 1980 cancelled PT Amco\u2019s Foreign Investment Licence so that PT Amco \"may no longer mange the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Building, unless the Court decides otherwise in the main case\".\n\n136.\n\nIn the meantime, on July 16, 1980, counsels for PT Amco filed an Exception to the Jurisdiction of the Indonesian Courts to hear any dispute arising out of the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement because Clause 12 of such Agreement stated that the parties must settle any dispute arising therefrom by International Chamber of Commerce arbitration in Paris. On October 8, 1980, the Jakarta Court rejected said Exception to Jurisdiction. Evidently, this judgment was not rendered in writing.\n\n137.\n\nOn November 12, 1980, PT Amco filed a Reply on the merits of PT Wisma\u2019s suit in which its arguments against the same were fully developed.\n\nOn December 10, 1980, PT Wisma filed a Replication answering PT Amco\u2019s Reply.\n\nPT Amco filed a Rejoinder and Conclusions on January 21, 1981 and May 15, 1981 respectively.\n\nOn its side, PT Wisma filed its Conclusions on April 3, 1981 and Additional Conclusions on May 29, 1981.\n\n138.\n\nThe attorney for PT Amco then submitted a written brief summarizing the points evidently made by two witnesses which apparently testified on July 3, 1981. According to PT Amco\u2019s attorney, the witnesses in question \"supported Defendant\u2019s arguments that Hotel Kartika Plaza was taken over physically by PT Wisma Kartika on March 31, 1980\". PT Wisma, on September 4, 1981, filed a \"Reaction Against Defendant\u2019s Witnesses and its Arguments\", which did not really add anything new to its position and emphasized that PT Amco and not Amco Asia was the proper party to defend its suit. On September 18, 1981, PT Amco submitted its \"Final Reply/Conclusions\" which repeated once more its position with respect to jurisdiction, procedure and the merits of the case.\n\n139.\n\nOn January 12, 1982 the Central Jakarta District Court, sitting in first instance, rendered its judgment with respect to PT Wisma\u2019s suit and PT Amco\u2019s counterclaim. The Court found that:\n\na) PT Amco itself invested only US $1,399,000 whereas its obligations under the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement was to invest US $4,000,000 and that in claiming to have invested more, PT Amco \"went through PT Aeropacific, which constitutes national capital\" and, in so doing, breached its investment application and licence.\n\nb) PT Amco \"acknowledged as true that it never made periodic reports on its activities to BKPM\" and that it did not deny having transferred money abroad which transfers were \"not with the government\u2019s permission\" in breach of a 1973 BKPM Letter of Decision.\n\nc) PT Amco did, as alleged by PT Wisma, secure PT Wisma\u2019s generator as security for a loan from Bank Bali in breach of the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement.\n\nd) The Government had on July 8, 1980 revoked PT Amco\u2019s investment licence and thus PT Amco could not carry out any agreement with PT Wisma because such a situation would conflict with the law and therefore would be null and void.\n\ne) The 1968 Lease and Management Agreement, its amendment of May 19, 1968 and the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement were rescinded and PT Amco ordered to pay Rp. 799,341,657.18 compensation to PT Wisma, this being based on the PT First National Adjustment Company report of May 16, 1979.\n\nf) The defamation claim was rejected.\n\ng) PT Amco\u2019s counterclaim was rejected as were its arguments with respect to jurisdiction and the interlocutory decree.\n\n140.\n\nOn January 21, 1982, PT Amco filed an appeal and on February 10, 1982, the Central District Court ruled that the execution of its judgment of January 12, 1982 was suspended pending the outcome of PT Amco\u2019s appeal.\n\n141.\n\nOn November 28, 1983, the Jakarta Appellate Court rendered its judgment on PT Amco\u2019s appeal. It ruled that:\n\na) with respect to the interlocutory decree that because of BKPM\u2019s Decision of July 9, 1980 to revoke PT Amco\u2019s investment licence and in view of the August 4, 1980 Supreme Court ruling, \"the Central Jakarta District Court\u2019s interlocutory decree can be upheld\";\n\nb) with respect to PT Amco\u2019s Exception to Jurisdiction, the Appellate Court ruled as follows:\n\n(i) in connection with PT Amco\u2019s allegation that due process had not been observed when the interlocutory judgment was rendered because PT Amco had not been summoned or heard before the Interlocutory Decree was granted, the Appellate Court stated that PT Amco\u2019s exception had to be rejected, Its reasoning for this was that since the take-over of March 31, 1980, PT Wisma was in fact in control of the property; PT Amco had not itself managed the property during the time it had sub-leased its rights to PT Aeropacific; PT Amco had not met its obligations under the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement particularly \"concerning foreign investment, etc...\"; PT Amco may not any longer manage the hotel because on July 9, 1980, BKPM revoked PT Amco\u2019s investment licence and the Interlocutory Decree \"only upheld the state of law in which PT Wisma had conducted the daily management\" of the property;\n\n(ii) with respect to the argument that the dispute between PT Amco and PT Wisma should have been settled by International Chamber of Commerce arbitration as supposedly referred to in the 1968 Lease and Management Contract, the Appellate Court ruled that the terms of the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement and its reference to the fact that the parties chose their permanent domicile for purposes thereof at the Central Jakarta District Court, plus the reference that all previous provisions of the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement which were contrary thereto were null, rendered the question of International Chamber of Commerce arbitration no longer operable;\n\n(iii) the argument that Amco also had to be made a defendant in the case was also rejected on the grounds that PT Amco when it was formed had succeeded to Amco\u2019s rights and obligations under the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement.\n\nc) On the merits of PT Wisma\u2019s suit, the Appellate Court ruled that the ruling of the Court of first instance was correct and proper according to law and must be upheld.\n\nd) On the counterclaim, the Appellate Court likewise made the judgment of the court of first instance its own.\n\nAccordingly, PT Amco\u2019s counterclaim was rejected.\n\nPart II - Preliminary Matters\n-----------------------------\n\nCHAPTER I \u2014 THE CLAIMS, DEFENCES AND COUNTERCLAIM\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*Section 1 - The Claims and Defences*\n-------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe first description of the claims put before the Tribunal was given by Claimants in paragraph 1 of the Request for Arbitration, here above cited (see para. 1), It appears, from this short description, that the Claimants were invoking two causes of action, namely the alleged seizure of the investment and cancellation of the investment licence.\n\nThen, in the \"Claimants\u2019 Statement of Facts and Law\", the Claimants invoked again, as the basis of their claim, the *taking over* of the Kartika Plaza Hotel from PT Amco and the *premature revocation* of the investment licence.\n\nIn their Reply to Indonesia\u2019s Counter-Memorial, Claimants contended (conclusions, para. 2) that:\n\n(t)he Tribunal's jurisdiction extends to all of Indonesia\u2019s wrongful actions including the seizure of the Hotel by its army, the revocation of the investment licence by its Investment Board and the rescission of Lease and Management contracts by its courts, because such actions deprived Claimants of their investment without compensation.\n\nIn addition, Claimants stated (Reply to Indonesia\u2019s Counter-Memorial, conclusions, para. 4) that they:\n\n... would be entitled to compensation even if the cancellation of the investment licence had been justified to the extent that the value conferred on Indonesia exceeds Indonesia\u2019s damages.\n\nIn this respect, Claimants contend (Reply, at 111) that:\n\n(they) are entitled to restitution for the benefit conferred on Indonesia, under the doctrine of unjust enrichment, even if they committed breaches.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent denied the seizure of the Hotel Kartika Plaza by the Government, as alleged by Claimants (III, A.9) and contended that the revocation of PT Amco\u2019s investment licence was lawful (III, B and C).\n\nThen, in the Rejoinder on the Merits, Respondent contended (at 51 ff.) that Claimants cannot recover on any theory of unjust enrichment.\n\nFinally, as again stated by Mr Hornick, counsel for Claimants, in its final oral argument (see Minutes of the hearings in Copenhagen, at 941),\n\nClaimants contend:\n\n... with respect to causes of action... that there are three distinct theories of recovery in this case. And that each of these theories is recognized by both Indonesian and international law, That is to say, *expropriation, breach of contract and unjust enrichment* (emphasis provided).\n\nThe same causes of action were discussed and denied by the Respondent, in its briefs hereabove mentioned, and in the final oral argument presented on its behalf at the hearings in Copenhagen.\n\n143.\n\nAs to the amount claimed by Claimants, Claimants stated in the final stage of the proceedings that the amount of their claim was US $15,428,000, the hotel having been valued at this amount on December 1, 1983 (Copenhagen transcript, at 1484 ff.).\n\nIn addition, Claimants requested that interest on the amount claimed, from March 31, 1980, costs and disbursements of this arbitration and counsel fees be awarded (Request for Arbitration, at 14). Said claims were reaffirmed in Claimants\u2019 Reply to Indonesia\u2019s Counter-Memorial, dated February 28, 1983 (at 125) and in the final oral argument (see Minutes, at 1484). However, according to Mr Hornick\u2019s statement in oral argument, interest up to December 31, 1983 having been included in the valuation of the hotel at this date, additional interest should run only from such date to the date of effective payment.\n\n144.\n\nDenying all the claims, on whatever basis, Respondent requested the Tribunal to decide that no compensation' at all is to be awarded to Claimants.\n\nHowever, discussing subsidiarily the maximum amount of damages that could be alleged by Claimants, Respondent contended that the figure should be placed at between US $720,000 and $1,110,000 (Resp. Rejoinder on the Merits at 59).\n\nIn addition, Respondent contended that the interest rate should not be higher than 6%, and that all monetary awards should be made in Indonesian rupiahs.\n\n*Section II - The Counterclaim*\n-------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial of December 30, 1982, the Republic of Indonesia asked the Tribunal (Submissions, para. 5, at 108-9):\n\n(a) To adjudge and declare\n\n(i) That Indonesia was fully justified in revoking PT Amco\u2019s investment licence because of violations of its obligations under the licence and other violations of Indonesian law and applicable rules of international law, and that PT Amco is obliged to return to Indonesia the amount of all tax and other concessions which Indonesia granted to PT Amco;\n\n(ii) That, accordingly, PT Amco\u2019s claims are dismissed and Indonesia\u2019s counterclaim is granted.\n\nThe same counterclaim was presented in the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits, dated October 31, 1983 (at 60-1, and submissions, at 62, iii). The total amount of the counterclaim, as indicated in the Rejoinder (at 61) is US $583,591,000, the exchange rate used for all computations in this respect was the then current average rate of US $1 / Rp. 975. In oral argument (see Copenhagen transcript, at 1551), Mr Brower stated that in this respect as well, an award in rupiahs would be \"appropriate\".\n\nIn the final oral argument, counsel for the Respondent simply referred to the pleadings on the counterclaim; accordingly, the counterclaim remained unchanged, as to its causes as well as to its amount.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent asked the Tribunal (Rejoinder on the Merits, at 63):\n\nTo adjudge and declare pursuant to Article 61(2) of the Convention that Claimants shall pay all costs of the present proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the members of this Tribunal, the charges for use of the facilities of the Centre, and the expenses incurred by Indonesia in connection with these proceedings.\n\n146.\n\nClaimant concluded that the Tribunal should reject the counterclaim (see Cl. Reply to CM, at 125).\n\nCHAPTER II \u2014 THE APPLICABLE LAW\n-------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nThe present dispute is to be decided according to the applicable rules of law, since the parties did not agree to entrust the Tribunal with the power to decide it *ex aequo et bono,* like they could have done according to Article 42, para. 3 of the Washington Convention.\n\nArticle 42, paragraph 1 of said Convention provides as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable. '\n\n148.\n\nThe parties having not expressed an agreement as to the rules of law according to which the disputes between them should be decided, the Tribunal has to apply Indonesian law, which is the law of the Contracting State Party to the dispute, and such rules of international law as the Tribunal deems to be applicable, considering the matters and issues in dispute.\n\nAs to Indonesian law, there is no need to enter into a discussion of its conflicts of laws\u2019 rules. Indeed, Claimants as well as Respondent were constantly referring, in their discussion on the merits to the substantive law of Indonesia. Moreover, the dispute before the Tribunal relating to an investment in Indonesia, there is no doubt that the substantive municipal rules of law to be applied by the Tribunal are to drawn from Indonesian law.\n\nSimilarly, by virtue of Article 42 of the Convention, the appropriate rules of international law are to be applied by the Tribunal; here again, it can be mentioned that the parties not only did not deny their applicability, but constantly referred to them in their pleadings and in the final oral arguments (see, in particular, as to the Respondent Resp. Rejoinder on the Merits, at 47, footnote xx; and as to the Claimant; oral argument, Mr Rand, Copenhagen transcript, at 939; Mr Hornick, Copenhagen transcript, at 941 ff., 943).\n\nCHAPTER III \u2014 ISSUES TO BE DISCUSSED\n------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nAs stated earlier, Claimants invoke three bases of claims:\n\n\u2014 expropriation;\n\n\u2014 breach of contract, that respondent allegedly committed by revoking the application\u2019s to invest approval (in other words, the \"revocation of the licence\");\n\n\u2014 unjust enrichment.\n\nThe two first bases of claims will be discussed hereunder (Sections C and D). On the other hand, there will not be need to discuss whether, considering the applicable law and the circumstances of the case, the theory of unjust enrichment may provide a basis of claim. Indeed, for the reasons stated below, the Tribunal will admit the State\u2019s responsibility in the framework of the two first bases of claims relied upon by Claimants, however not adhering to all the interpretations and arguments related to said bases of claims, as developed by the Claimants. Consequently, the unjust enrichment claim will become unnecessary.\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimants contend that three facts and/or acts deprived them of the rights they acquired when they received the authorization of Indonesia to invest, namely:\n\n\u2014 the \"seizure\" of the hotel;\n\n\u2014 the revocation of the licence;\n\n\u2014 the Jakarta Court decisions, which rescinded the Lease and Management Agreement.\n\nWhile discussing the two first facts and/or acts, the Tribunal will not enter into the detailed discussion of the third one.\n\nIndeed, it is common ground in international law that the international responsibility of a State is not committed by the acts of its municipal courts, except where such acts amount to *denial of justice* (see in general: D. P. O\u2019Connell, *International Law,* vol. 2, at 1024 ff.; Charles Rousseau, *Droit International Public, tome* V, 1983, at 66 ff.).\n\nNow, however broadly the concept of denial of justice may be construed and applied (see Rousseau, *ibid.)* the Tribunal is of the view that the proceedings in the Jakarta Courts (see above, paras 131-41) do not lead us to consider that there was one in the instant case. This does not mean, of course, that the findings of the Jakarta Courts are binding on this Tribunal: indeed, in oral argument, counsel for Respondent expressly admitted they are not. But the fact that the Tribunal will not adhere to such findings does not mean that by expressing a different opinion, the Jakarta Courts committed a denial of justice, for which the Republic of Indonesia could be held internationally responsible.\n\n151.\n\nMoreover, the dispute in the Jakarta Courts was not one between the parties in the present arbitration, but rather one between PT Wisma Kartika and PT Amco, and the Tribunal has already decided, in the award on jurisdiction, that while having jurisdiction over the parties before it, it would not enter into the litigation between the parties to the Lease and Management Agreement.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that it was not the Jakarta Courts which revoked the investment licence; such courts merely took into account the fact that the revocation had been decided by the proper administrative authority. Therefore, it is not to the courts to which an infringement of the State\u2019s obligations, flowing from the licence previously granted, could be imputed.\n\n152.\n\nAccordingly, in the Discussion (Part III) the Tribunal will first consider two bases of claim relied upon by Claimants, namely:\n\n\u2014 expropriation (Chapter I),\n\n\u2014 breach of contract (Chapter II).\n\nThen, it will examine the prejudice caused to Claimants by Respondent\u2019s acts and the damages to be awarded in order to compensate for same (Chapter III); the counterclaim (Chapter IV); the costs (Chapter V).\n\nPart III - Discussion\n---------------------\n\nCHAPTER I \u2014 THE ISSUE OF EXPROPRIATION\n--------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nAs mentioned above (para. 1) the Claimants in paragraph 1 of the Request for Arbitration stated *inter alia:*\n\nThe Republic seized the investment in an armed military action... The parties dispute the right of the Republic to seize the investment...\n\nAs likewise mentioned above counsel for Claimants contended that one of the causes for action and thereby for recovery is *expropriation* as allegedly realized by the \"seizure\" or \"take-over\" of the hotel during the events of March 30/April 1, 1980.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 Statement of Facts and Law they further alleged that the Respondent violated Articles 21 and 22 of Indonesia\u2019s Foreign Investment Law No. 1/1967 which expressly guarantees that the Government shall not expropriate any foreign capital except under certain conditions which were not fulfilled in this case (see the provisions hereunder, para. 157).\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial (at 78) the Respondent denied that the rights of the Claimants were seized by an expropriation. The Respondent further denies in its Rejoinder on the Merits (at 3-20) that the loss of PT Amco\u2019s hotel management rights resulted from an \"Army take-over\" as there was \"no armed, military action on April 1, 1980\" and as \"the allegation of an armed, military action cannot be supported by attributing acts of PT Wisma to Indonesia\".\n\n155.\n\n[sic]. The events on which the Claimants base their claim are described above in paras 79-109. Even if some of the testimony of certain witnesses contradict each other, and even if some of the documentary evidences can be interpreted in different ways, the Tribunal is satisfied that on or about the critical period there was a taking of Claimants rights to the control and management of the land and all the Kartika Plaza building. Such a take-over was clearly intended in the letter of March 31, 1980 from PT Wisma (see paras 90-1 above) and subsequently carried out and finalized.\n\nThe Tribunal is further satisfied that a number of army and police personnel were present at the hotel premises on April 1, 1980 and by their very presence assisted in the successful seizure from PT Amco of the exercise of its lease and management rights (see paras 93-103).\n\n156.\n\nThe question now is whether this taking is or amounts to an expropriation which according to Indonesian law and to international law can give rise to a claim for compensation.\n\n157.\n\nIn Article 21 of the Indonesian Law of Foreign Investment No. 1/1967 it is stated:\n\nThe Government shall not undertake a total nationalization/revocation of ownership rights of foreign capital enterprises nor take steps to restrict the rights of control and/or management of the enterprises concerned, except when declared by Act of Parliament that the interest of the State requires such a step.\n\nArticle 22 states:\n\n1. In the case of the measures referred to in Article 21, the Government has the obligation to provide compensation, the amount, type and paymentprocedure of which shall have been agreed upon by both parties in accordance with the principles valid in international law...\n\nThe law further states that if no agreement between the parties can be reached the question shall be settled by an arbitration which shall be binding for both parties.\n\n158.\n\nIn the extensive legal literature which exits on the question of expropriation in international law, the problem of definition that is to say a clear statement of what is understood by expropriation in international law, has not received great attention. There have, however, been authorities who have tried to make a legal distinction between different kinds of interference in private property based on differences in motive, object, extent, form and/ or purpose.\n\nEspecially important in this respect is, however, that it is generally accepted in international law, that a case of expropriation exists not only when a state takes over private property but also when the expropriating state transfers ownership to another legal or natural person. Expropriation in international law also exists merely by the state withdrawing the protection of its courts from the owner expropriated, and tacitly allowing a *de facto* possessor to remain in possession of the thing seized, as did the Roman praetor in allowing *longi temporis praescripto, (cf* B. A. Wortley, *Expropriation in Public International Law,* 1959)\n\nEven if there are many different opinions as to the concept of expropriation in international law *(cf.* also the discussion held at the *Institut de Droit International* in 1952, *Annuaire* (1952), vol. 44. II. p. 283) it emerges, however, as a *conditio sine qua non* that there shall exist a taking of private property and that such taking shall have been executed or instigated by a government, on behalf of a government or by an act which otherwise is attributable to a government.\n\n159.\n\nThe take-over of Kartika Plaza consequently raises the following questions:\n\na) Did the taking occur on behalf of or on the instigation of the Republic?\n\nb) Did the taking occur on behalf of or on the instigation of the army, Inkopad or PT Wisma, and if so can such be attributed to the Republic?\n\nThe taking was instigated by PT Wisma and was carried out for the benefit of the same. As it appears from paragraph 91 above, the decision to carry it out was taken by General Soerjo, a director of PT Wisma who acted as stated in the letter of March 31, 1980 on the ground that PT Wisma was the owner of the Kartika Plaza Hotel/building and land.\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal was not provided with any evidence that the take-over of the hotel and thereby the taking of the Claimants\u2019 exercise of their rights to control and management was due to a governmental decision.\n\n161.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (page 24), the Claimants contend that PT Wisma was merely the \"alter ego\" of the Respondent. In supporting this view the Claimants refer to several statements made by the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian National Army in the *PT Wisma Kartika 10th Anniversary Book* (October 1974), where he expressed the view that:\n\n(t)en years ago, the Indonesian Army Command... establish(ed) an organization (which) owing to the determination and courage... in every individual member of the Indonesian Army... has grown up and developed into the present PT Wisma Kartika.\n\nand further:\n\n(t)he pioneers and members of the board (of PT Wisma Kartika)... have added up to the good reputation of the Indonesian National Army during all these years.\n\nThe Claimants further referred to a letter dated April 14, 1980 (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. IV No. 87) from PT Wisma and BKPM, stating that:\n\nthe Defense Minister/Commander and Chief of the Armed Forces (is) our highest authority.\n\nThe Respondent admitted (Resp. CM, p. 21) the fact that Inkopad owned all of PT Wisma\u2019s outstanding shares in 1967 and that it selected PT Wisma\u2019s management. The Respondent further contended that:\n\nInkopad was established to provide certain social welfare services to Indonesian Army Personnel.\n\nIn its Rejoinder (at 25) Claimants draw the conclusions that:\n\nPT Wisma Kartika has never been a private commercial enterprise, or operated for the benefit of anyone other than the Army.\n\nTherefore - in the opinion of the Claimants - the acts of PT Wisma should be attributed to the Respondent.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept this point of view of the Claimants. The Tribunal finds that although it is proven that a close relationship exists between PT Wisma and Inkopad, and between the latter and the armed forces (see above, para. 9) this fact in itself does not attribute the acts of PT Wisma or its leadership to the Government of Indonesia.\n\n163.\n\nBy reaching this conclusion the Tribunal accepts that PT Wisma is registered as a limited liability company and that the acts of such entities are not normally to be attributed to their shareholders.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that in a country like the Republic of Indonesia the military establishment has a dual task: 1) to take care of the external and internal security of the State and \"2) to build - rebuild the nation\" (see Cl. Doc. 102).\n\nThe second task means that some economic activities which in some countries are taken care of by private or public owned companies are run in Indonesia by people who belong to or are retired from the military establishment. This fact cannot in the opinion of the Tribunal change the legal evaluation that PT Wisma is an economic entity which has its own profit-seeking goal. This goal is by nature not different from the objective of other private economic entities, but is certainly very different from the normal purpose of a government: i.e. public administration in its widest sense.\n\nOn the other hand, this close relationship between some of the leadership of PT Wisma and the active police/army establishment was in the opinion of the Tribunal precisely the reason why it had been possible for PT Wisma to call in the police/army with the effect that the Investor was intimidated to give up its right to control and management of the property.\n\nBut these acts of PT Wisma are not an expropriation or taking neither according to national (Indonesian) nor to international law. Nor are the acts of PT Wisma in any way attributable to the Government of Indonesia.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal is, however, satisfied that if it was not for the presence of a number of army/police personnel on the hotel premises, which personnel were called into - and as a matter of fact also succeeded to -support the take-over, the Claimant would not - at least at that stage - have had to give up their control and management of the Kartika Plaza Hotel. PT Wisma would therefore not at that date have been in the position to take over the management of the hotel.\n\n165.\n\nThese findings of the Tribunal, however, raise a question whether the assistance rendered to PT Wisma by the police/army personnel as such can involve responsibility for the Government of Indonesia?\n\n166.\n\nAs stated above (para. 88 ff.) PT Wisma and the Claimants at the end of March 1980 were in dispute concerning the implementation of the agreements between the parties and the amounts which the respective parties thought were due by PT Amco to PT Wisma. It was this dispute which eventually ended - with the assistance of the army/police personnel -in the take-over of the control and management of Kartika Plaza.\n\n167.\n\nIt follows from the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement, paragraph 2, (see para. 81 above) that \"the management of the Kartika Plaza Land and Building with all its contents shall be carried out, implemented and the full responsibility of PT Amco\".\n\nThe take-over was contrary to this agreement.\n\n168.\n\nThe decision by PT Wisma to take over the hotel was further contrary to Clause 6 in the Profit Sharing Agreement of October 6, 1978 in which PT Wisma and PT Amco agreed that any dispute shall be settled directly by and between the parties by upholding the principle of \"consultations to reach agreement\", mutual respect and with the aim: successful, peaceful, and orderly business in Jakarta-Indonesia (Cl. Doc. No. 16).\n\n169.\n\nBy enforcing - with the assistance of army/police personnel - a unilateral decision contrary to contractual undertakings and without having this decision justified either by agreement or by court decision PT Wisma was committing an act of illegal self-help.\n\nTo be sure, in civil law systems, like for instance the French law and Indonesian law, in spite of a court decision being in principle required for termination of a contract (see e.g. French Civil Code, Article 1134), there are exceptional instances, where a contract may be unilaterally terminated, provided a Court decision will afterwards legitimize such termination (see Legal Opinion by Professors Terre and Viandier, Resp. Legal Appendices, vol. IX, B-3 at 4 ff.). However, the mere reading of the examples given by these distinguished scholars shows that there was not, in the instance case, such an exceptional situation.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal does not know of any authority which can legitimize an act of army or police personnel in which the said personnel assist a private party in establishing a situation which deprives another party of its contractual rights unless the internal situation or the upkeeping of law and order makes this absolutely necessary. There is no evidence that such a situation of emergency existed in this case on March 31/April 1, 1980.\n\n171.\n\nIn this case where the Claimants through their ownership of the shares in PT Amco were foreign investors the army/police personnel had a special duty to assist the Claimants in at least preserving the status quo until the dispute between the parties was settled by means of law.\n\nBy not doing this, an act was committed by the army/police against the Claimants whereby the latter - at least for a time - lost their right to management and control.\n\n172.\n\nIt is a generally accepted rule of international law, clearly stated in international awards and judgments and generally accepted in the literature, that a State has a duty to protect aliens and their investment against unlawful acts committed by some of its citizens (see e.g. O\u2019Connell, *International Law,* 2nd ed. vol. 2, at 941 ff. and references at 941, footnote 1). If such acts are committed with the active assistance of state-organs a breach of international law occurs. In this respect the Tribunal wants to draw attention to the Draft Articles on State Responsibility formulated in 1979 by the International Law Commission and presented to the General Assembly of the United Nations as an expression of accepted principles of international law:\n\nArt. 3: There is an internationally wrongful act of a State when:\n\na. Conduct consisting of an action or an omission is attributable to the State under International law.\n\n...\n\nArt. 5: For the purpose of the present articles, conduct of any State organ having that status under the internal law of that State shall be considered as an act of the State concerned under International Law, provided that the organ was acting in that capacity in the case in question.\n\nArt. 10: The conduct of an organ of a State... such organ having acted in that capacity, shall be considered as an act of the State under International Law even if, in the particular case, the organ exceeded its competence according to internal law or contravened instruction concerning its activity.\n\nOn the basis of the proven actions and omissions of the army/police personnel in connection with the take-over the Tribunal cannot but draw the conclusion that an internationally wrongful act was committed and that this act is attributable to the Government of Indonesia which therefore is internationally responsible. '\n\n173.\n\nThe findings of the Tribunal are based on the facts that the take-over of the hotel by PT Wisma - with the assistance of the army/police - and thereby depriving PT Amco of the management and control was an act of illegal self-help. However, the question is raised whether the subsequent legal proceedings instigated by PT Wisma against PT Amco in the Indonesian court and the outcome of these proceedings can with retroactive effect legitimize an act - or omission - which was wrongful when committed?\n\n174.\n\nThe Indonesian court proceedings are described in paras 131-41. It follows from this description that the Central Jakarta District Court granted *ex parte* PT Wisma\u2019s request for an interlocutory decree giving PT Wisma permission to manage the Kartika Plaza property (para. 134). The Greater Jakarta Court granted, however, on July 8, 1980, PT Amco\u2019s request for postponement of implementation of the Interlocutory Decree (para. 135).\n\n175.\n\nOn August 4, 1980, the Indonesian Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the Greater Jakarta Court. One of its reasons for their judgment (see para. 135) was that PT Wisma:\n\nat the time of filing its suit had been managing the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Buildings at Jalan, M. H. Thamrin, No. 10. In other words, the defendant, PT Amco Indonesia, was no longer managing the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Buildings. Therefore interlocutory decree No. 279/1980 G dated the 28th May 1980 in fact strengthened temporarily the legal condition in which PT Wisma Kartika had been managing the Kartika Plaza Hotel and Buildings.\n\nIt follows from this formulation that the Supreme Court did not legitimize the April 1 take-over of the hotel but on the contrary based its decision on the very same factual situation - the seizure - without expressing any legal evaluation of this act. This is not a legitimization of PT Wisma\u2019s behaviour in connection with the take-over.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the judgments of January 12, 1982 and November 28, 1983, on the merits (paras 139, 141 above) do not purport to legitimize the unilateral acts of PT Wisma in connection with the take-over, and even less to legitimize the acts or omissions of the army/police personnel.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal wants to underline that by discussing the Indonesian courts\u2019 judgments and decisions, the Tribunal is not departing from its Award on Jurisdiction (para. 39) where it is stressed that the dispute put before this Tribunal is not a dispute between private parties. The Respondent before the Tribunal is not PT Wisma but the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nIn any case, an international tribunal is not bound to follow the result of a national court. One of the reasons for instituting an international arbitration procedure is precisely that parties - rightly or wrongly - feel often more confident with a legal institution which is not entirely related to one of the parties. If a national judgment was binding on an international tribunal such a procedure could be rendered meaningless,\n\nAccordingly, no matter how the legal position of a party is described in a national judgment, an international arbitral tribunal enjoys the right to evaluate and examine this position without accepting any *res judicata* effect of a national court. In its evaluation, therefore, the judgments of a national court can be accepted as one of the many factors which have to be considered by the arbitral tribunal.\n\n178.\n\nOn this basis the Tribunal can only conclude that the acts of PT Wisma on or about March 30/April 1, 1980, were illegal self-help and the assistance to these acts given to PT Wisma and lack of protection afforded to PT Amco, a foreign investor in Indonesia by the army/police was an international wrong attributable to the Republic.\n\nThe legal consequences of this international wrong will be discussed below (see para. 256 ff. hereunder).\n\nCHAPTER II \u2014 THE CLAIM FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*Section I - The Legal Characterization of the Relationship Between the Republic of Indonesia and the Claimants*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe first issue to which this claim gives rise is whether there was a contract in the relationship between Claimants and Respondent.\n\nClaimants allege there was such a relationship (see in particular Mr Hornick\u2019s oral argument, Copenhagen transcript, at 953 ff.). More precisely, they contend that:\n\nthe investment application and approval decree taken together constitute what... in international law has been called, quasi international contract or economic development agreement, rather than a mere unilateral or administrative act or what... is called in the French system an administrative contract.\n\nWhile admitting (Copenhagen transcript, p. 956) that \"in calling this a contract or an economic development agreement, it may be a little misleading to use the term of contract\", Mr Hornick states:\n\nthat at least in Indonesia, it is viewed as much more like a contract than like a pure unilateral administrative act, (a) and that as a result, the investment application and the licence taken together give rise to certain rights and obligations on the part of both sides to that contract, which neither side is at liberty to violate unilaterally.\n\nDealing with the same issue, Mr Brower, counsel to Respondent, stated (Copenhagen transcript, p. 1289) that:\n\nthe question was raised whether \"(the licence)\" might somehow be comparable to a *convention d\u2019etablissement* in French law, or an administrative act or an administrative contract, or is this a contract in the usual private contract law sense.\n\nThen, to answer this question, Mr Brower relied essentially on a legal opinion delivered to Respondent by Professor Pierre Delvolve (Resp. Leg. App., vol. VII, Tab 1-2), where the distinguished scholar states (at 6) that he was \"... requested to establish the principles of French law relating to the decisions adopted by the Indonesian authorities\" (i.e. the approval of the investment, and then the revocation of the \"investment authorization\") \"and what consequences they may have on the rights of the parties concerned\", concludes (at 47), after a careful analysis of French precedents and authorities, that \"the questions raised can be answered as follows, *based on the principles of French administrative law* (emphasis provided):\n\n1. The authorization granted Amco Asia in 1968 constituted a unilateral administrative act subject to a condition... 2. The failure of Amco Asia to comply with the conditions to which the authorization was made subject, that is to say, with the content and conditions of the project authorized, justified the withdrawal of the authorization and of the advantages it had provided... 3. The Indonesian State cannot be held liable either on the ground of liability for fault or on the ground of liability without fault; in particular, the theory of unjust enrichment does not apply.\n\n180.\n\nBefore going itself into the legal analysis and characterization of the legal complex constituted by the investment application and the approval thereof, the Tribunal deems it necessary to make a preliminary remark.\n\nIt is obvious that in the instant case, such characterization can by no means be made on the basis of French law. Not only is French law not applicable as such in this case, but, as far as it embodies the concept of administrative contracts, to characterize the relationships between the State and persons or entities who participate to economic activities, not even an analogy can be drawn from it in the framework of the large majority of the other legal systems. Indeed, said legal concepts are very specific to French law. To be sure, they may be met in legal systems whose administrative law derives, for historical reasons, from the French one, or has been directly influenced by the latter. However, the other legal systems, be they of civil or of common law, do not embody these particular concepts; and even where they do contain particular rules governing the relationships established by individual acts between State and private enterprises, such rules are not based on the particular technicalities developed in this field by the French jurisprudence and case law.\n\nAccordingly, while it is acceptable to say, as counsel to Indonesia did (Copenhagen transcript, at 1290) that \"an important source of international law\" would be a practice or legal provisions common to \"a number of nations\", the French concepts of administrative unilateral acts or administrative contracts and the French rules on these legal concepts are *not* practices or legal provisions common to all nations.\n\nTo characterize the investment application and its approval in the instant case, a \"community\" of legal concepts is to be sought in the common definition of contract in several legal systems, and in particular in the civil law systems, since Indonesian private law, largely influenced by Dutch law, has a close affinity to said systems; and of course, before even trying to find out such common principles, one has to consider Indonesian, law itself, which as previously stated, is applicable as being the law of the country which is a party to the dispute at hand.\n\n181.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the Indonesian Civil Code define a contract as follows:\n\nArt. 1233\u2014All obligations arise either from a contract or from the law.  \nArt. 1234\u2014They aim at giving something, to do or not to do something.  \nArt. 1313\u2014A Contract is an act by which one or several persons bind themselves towards one or several others.\n\nCombining Articles 1234 and 1313, one may set up a definition of contract which is very close to the one that may be found in the French Civil Code.\n\nArticle 1101 of the same provides as follows:\n\nContract is a convention by which one or several persons undertake, towards one or several others, to give, to do or not to do something.\n\nStrictly speaking, the Indonesian and the French definitions mean that the contract is a convention generating obligations; or in other words, a kind of convention, the latter being, more generally, an agreement aimed at producing legal effects (see e.g. *Traite de droit civil, sous la direction de Jacques Ghestin, Les obligations, Le contrat,* par Jacques Ghestin, 1980, at 3 ff.). However, for practical purposes, the two terms (contract and convention) are used interchangeably, thus becoming in effect synonymous. Given the similarity between the French and the Indonesian definitions of contract, one may assume that they can be construed in the same way in both legal systems.\n\n182.\n\nNow, one may find a similar or at least comparable notion of contract, not only in civil law systems, but at common law as well.\n\nThus, Articles 1269, 1270 and 1313 of the Dutch Civil Code are respectively identical to Articles 1233,1234 and 1313 of the Indonesian Civil Code. In Belgian law, contract is an agreement of two or several wills in view of producing legal effects. Article 1321 of the Italian Civil Code provides that \"the contract is an agreement between two or several parties to constitute, rule or extinguish between them a legal patrimonial relationship\". In German law, a contract is an agreement between two or several persons on a subject matter of legal interest; it aims to engender, modify or extinguish obligations. In Danish law, the contract is an agreement concluded by two or several persons that creates obligations (see: Institut de droit compare de Paris, *La formation du contrat sous la direction de Rene Rodiere,* Paris 1976, recapitulatory table).\n\nThe concept of contract is not fundamentally different at common law, although it is differently described. Thus, in Anson\u2019s *Law of Contract* (25th ed., by A. G. Guest, MA, 1979-83), the author writes (at 2): \"We may provisionally describe the law of contract as that branch of the law which determines the circumstances in which a promise shall be legally binding on the person making it\", and then states that:\n\na promise may be defined as a declaration or assurance made to another person, stating that a certain state of affairs exists, or that the maker will do, or refrain from, some specified act, and conferring on that other a right to claim the fulfilment of such declaration or assurance.\n\nThe contract itself (at 21):\n\nconsists of an actionable promise or promises. Every such promise involves at least two parties, and an outward expression of common intention and of expectation as to the declaration or assurance contained in the promise.\n\nLikewise, in his book on contracts (Boston and Toronto, 1982), under the heading \"The Meaning of Contract\" (Art. 3), Professor E. Allan - Farnsworth explains that books on the law of contracts often use the word \"contracts\" in a \"technical sense to mean a *promise,* or a set of promises, that the law will *enforce* or at least recognize in some other way\". The author cites the Restatement Second of Contracts, Sec. 1, where contract is defined as \"a promise or a set of promises of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty\" (at 3, footnote), and Sec. 2(1), which defines a promise as \"a manifestation of intention to act or refrain from acting in a specified way, so made as to justify a promise in understanding that a commitment has been made\".\n\n183.\n\nTo conclude, it may be said that Indonesian law as well as general principles of law drawn from the main legal systems, which constitute a source of international law applicable together with Indonesian law in the instant case, conceive of the contract as an agreement based on a meeting of minds and wills and creating obligations (or, which is not fundamentally different, creating promises enforceable by law), and in an even broader sense, concerning any legal subject matter.\n\nSuch being the general definition of contract, does the legal effect constituted, in the instant case, by the combination of the investment application and the approval thereof, correspond to this definition?\n\n184.\n\nA first remark should be here made.\n\nThe Investment Application, emanating from a company which not only seeks to invest, but declares it is prepared to undertake several obligations and to perform them if the application is approved, together with the approval of this application by a host State, which means at least that the latter agrees to the investment as described in the application - leaving aside, for the time being, the question as to whether the State itself undertakes reciprocal obligations- are undoubtedly expressing a meeting of minds and of wills, purporting to produce legal effects in the domain of economic activities. Consequently, if one would, apply here the broader concept of contract, the investment application and the approval thereof should together be considered as forming a contract. In particular, in the instant case, the Tribunal notes that according to Article 1 of the application, the applicant undertook the obligation to establish the business \"within a period of thirty days\".\n\nThe objection against such characterization by Professor Devolve, based on the fact that there is not an *instrumentum* that is to say, that apparently there is not a single document, executed by the applicant and the State which embodies the application and the approval, cannot be sustained.\n\nHowever, for certain type of contracts (like notarial contracts in civil law, or deeds at common law), neither the Indonesian law, nor any general principle of law, requires that such agreements be set out in a written document executed by both parties in order for such agreements to be characterized as contracts. From the formal viewpoint, offer and acceptance may by themselves constitute a contract, provided they are concordant one with each other ; and in fact, the investment application is nothing other than an offer to invest and an undertaking of several obligations relating to the proposed investment, and the approval thereof is, at least, an acceptance of said offer. It should be pointed out that Indonesian law provides that the foreign investment application and the approval thereof be made in given forms, and it is not alleged that these forms were not observed in the present case.\n\n185.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal intends to go into a deeper analysis of this question in order to reach a final characterization of the application approval combination, as it relates to the concept of contract.\n\nIndeed, as already said, strictly speaking, a contract is an agreement (or an *\"act\"* like the Indonesian and Dutch Civil Codes say) aiming to create obligations. Is the investment-approval combination a contract in this sense? Independently of any theoretical definition of contract, the question is obviously relevant in the instant case, because for all practical purposes, behind the claim of breach of contract lies the contention that Indonesia has ceased to fulfil its obligations under the investment licence it granted, and that such termination was not justified by the non-fulfilment by the Claimants of their own obligations.\n\nThere is of course no doubt, and it is admitted by all parties that in the investment application (whose precise heading was: \"Application to Establish PT Amco, Indonesia\") Amco Asia offered to undertake several obligations, and in particular the obligation to establish a foreign business in Indonesia (Article I), whose purpose and aim would be to act in the field of real estate business (Article II), and whose capital would total US $3,000,000.00 representing share capital (Article III), to be deposited stage by stage, and taking the form of cash, capital goods or both (Article IV). In addition, in his oral argument (see Copenhagen transcript, at 259), Mr Hornick stated that:\n\nit is fair and reasonable to read the application in such a ways as to believe that the parties understood and expected that Amco, the foreign investor, was indeed going to build a hotel in Indonesia or cause such a hotel to be built, or at least that that was its intention as of the time.\n\nAs a matter of fact, given the undertaking previously mentioned (see para. 184) it was more than a mere intention.\n\n186.\n\nAs already said, the approval of the application by the Republic of Indonesia expressed the latter\u2019s acceptance of the obligations that Amco offered to undertake, and it could be said that by this acceptance, a contract was formed between Indonesia and the company.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether Indonesia, by approving the application, itself undertook obligations towards the applicant.\n\nThere is no doubt, here again, that the applicant company was entitled to expect that its application having been approved, it would be allowed to effectively invest in the business described, to exploit this business for the period mentioned, and to have the benefit of several foreign exchange and fiscal concessions provided for by the Foreign Capital investment Law (Act No. 1 of 1967) and expressly asked for in the Application (see Exh. A to the Request for Arbitration, Article VIII and above, Sec. I-B, Facts, para. II, 17). But by the acceptance or approval of the Application, did obligations, and more precisely contractual obligations of the State arise which corresponded to this expectation on the part of the applicant, and are these obligations as binding as the undertakings and obligations of the applicant are?\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent denies this, relying essentially, in this respect, on Professor Delvolve\u2019s legal opinion. Now, coming back to the non-applicability, in the instant case, of principles that are particular to French administrative law, it is worthwhile to examine whether the basic logic underlying these principles precludes the characterization of the > application-approval combination as a contract.\n\ni) The first reason to refuse such characterization seems to be that the \"licence\" to invest is granted by the public authority under the condition that ; the recipient will fulfil his undertakings, and that the latter is not granted any right as long as it does not or if it ceases to fulfil them: this is the meaning of the characterization of the licence as an act under condition (\"acte sous condition\").\n\nThe Tribunal does not intend to deny this analysis of French law, and it is j even prepared to accept that in countries other than France, and in particular in Indonesia, when an investment application is approved, the Government understands, and the applicant should expect that the approval is granted under such condition. But if that means that the approval is granted under a resolutory condition (\"condition resolutoire\") namely, the fulfilment by the recipient of his obligations, this would not create a fundamental difference between the application-approval combination and a contract, particularly in French Law. Indeed, Article 1184 of the French Civil Code provides (para. 1) that \"the resolutory condition\" (la condition resolutoire) is always implied in a synallagmatic contract, for the case where one of the parties does not fulfil its commitments: thus, the obligation undertaken by each party in such a contract is subject to the performance, by the other party, of its own obligations. Moreover, it should be noticed that the Indonesian Civil Code contains a very similar provision.\n\nii) The second logical reason for the denial of a contractual characterization is that the authorization to invest and to run the business thus created, as well as the concessions granted to the investor (if any), are not deriving from the State\u2019s commitments, but from the law itself: the only meaning and purpose of the licence would be to make the relevant statutory provisions applicable to the individual applicant.\n\nEven admitting this interpretation - which, once again, is peculiar to French law and possibly to a limited number of other legal systems directly influenced by the same - it remains that by granting the licence, the State promises to apply the legal provisions in question for the benefit of a particular applicant, except, as it will be seen hereunder (para. 188 ff.) where the withdrawal of this promise is justified, and provided the conditions of such withdrawal are satisfied.\n\n188.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, here lies the crux of the matter.\n\nBeing an agreement aimed at producing legal effects in the economic field, creating obligations for the applicant and obligations for the State, even if in the latter case they are conditional, the legal combination formed by the application and by the approval thereof is not alien to the general concept of contract according to Indonesian law. Nor is it alien to general principles of law.\n\nHowever, it is not *identical* to a private law contract, due to the fact that the State is entitled to withdraw the approval it granted *for reasons which could not be invoked by a private contracting entity, and/or to decide and implement the withdrawal by utilizing procedures which are different from those which can and have to be utilized by a private entity..*\n\ni) First of all, the State is the natural protector of the nation\u2019s public interest and welfare. Accordingly, except when the State acts like a private person, that is not exercising in anyway its sovereign powers, the State is to be and indeed, is effectively, granted the right to alter, and even to suppress, where the public interest so requires, a situation or a relationship it created by a previous act, even if this act is the source of the State\u2019s commitment and obligations.\n\nThis is the fundamental principle of the right of a sovereign State to nationalize or expropriate property, including contractual rights previously granted by itself, even if they belong to aliens, by now clearly admitted in national legal systems as well as in international law; as to the latter, the principle is embodied in resolutions of the General Assembly of the United Nations (in particular, resolution 1803/XVII, of 14 December 1962) and in a number of international judicial and arbitral decisions.\n\nHowever, the right to nationalize supposes that the act by which the State purports to have exercised it, is a true nationalization, namely a taking of property or contractual rights which aims to protect or to promote the public interest.\n\nIt is here important to underscore that Indonesian law clearly abides by this principle. Indeed, Article 21 of \"Act No. 1/1967 Re Foreign Capital Investment\" (Claim. Statement of Facts Doc., Doc. 1) provides as follows:\n\nArt. 21\u2014The Government shall not undertake a total nationalization/ revocation of ownership rights of foreign capital enterprises, nor take steps to restrict the rights of control and/or management of the enterprises concerned, except when declared by Act of Parliament that the interest of the State requires such a step.\n\nIn addition, it is also clearly admitted in international law, as well as in Indonesian law, that the State which nationalizes has to provide compensation for the property and/or contractual rights thus taken form their owner or holder. In international law, the principle is embodied in the resolutions and decisions previously mentioned, which set out the principle of the State\u2019s right to nationalize. As to Indonesian law, it is consecrated in Article 22 of Law No. 1/1967, according to which (para. 1) \"in case of the measures referred to in Article 21, the Government has the obligation to provide compensation, the amount, type and payment-procedure of which shall have been agreed upon by both parties, in accordance with the principles valid in international law\"; or, failing such agreement, by international arbitration (paras 2 and 3), which likewise would obviously have to take into account the principles of international law.\n\nii) Secondly, the State is entitled to withdraw the approval of an investment application, where the applicant does not fulfil, once the approval was granted, the obligations the applicant offered to undertake.\n\nIn this respect, *there is substantially no fundamental difference between the position of the State and that of a party to a synallagmatic contract.* Indeed, a contracting party may, in almost all legal systems, terminate the contract where the other party does not perform its obligations.\n\nThe difference lies-or may lie-in the procedure. While in some systems (like, for example, the Indonesian and the French ones) termination of a private law contract is to be, in principle, ordered by a court (notwithstanding exceptions described by Professors Terre and Viandier in the legal opinion, they delivered to Respondent; see Resp. Legal App. vol. IX - B 83), the procedure of withdrawal of a \"licence\" is set out in administrative regulations which do not provide for a prior court decision. In other words, in respect of procedure, the State may be free from the requirement of a court decision when it decides to withdraw the application\u2019s approval; but *it has to abide by the rules of procedure of such withdrawal it has itself set up,* not to speak about the general principle of *due process* to which the recipient of the licence is entitled, which will be brought up and discussed later (see hereunder, para. 193 ff.).\n\n189.\n\nThe foregoing are the specific features which would allow consideration of the notion that the relationship established between foreign enterprise and a State by an investment application on the one hand and the approval of the same on the second is not identical to a private law contract, so that such relationship should not be characterized as a contract as such, but rather as a *sui generis* legal relationship, comparable to a contract. Indeed, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, such a relationship does not draw its source from a unilateral act of the State, but from a bilateral agreement between the State and the foreign applicant whose application is approved by the State.\n\nThe specific features of this relationship lead to the conclusion that a State may terminate such a relationship either for reasons of public interest and welfare - which is inconceivable in the case of a private law contract - of for reasons of non-fulfilment by the foreign applicant of its obligations, which is substantially identical to the parallel rule concerning contracts, but in some legal systems is implemented in other ways.\n\n190.\n\nIn the instant case, Respondent does not effectively base its claims on the characterization of the revocation of the application\u2019s approval as a measure of nationalization. The Republic alleges that such revocation was based on failure by Claimants to fulfil the obligations undertaken by the latter according to the Application, and justified by such failure. On their side, Claimants deny any failure of that kind.\n\nThe Tribunal will not enter into a discussion of the licence\u2019s revocation viewed as a nationalization. It should just be said here that should the revocation in the present case be thus characterized, it would at any event be totally irregular, since no Act of Parliament of Indonesia declared that this measure was required by the interests of the State. Moreover, would it have been a nationalization, compensation should have been provided to cover the damages suffered by the investor. Therefore, the consequences of a nationalization would have been the same as that of the unjustified \"breach of contract\" alleged by the Claimants.\n\n191.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal will now examine whether the withdrawal of the application\u2019s approval was in the circumstances of the case justified by the failures of the applicant as alleged by the Republic.\n\nBeforehand, one remark is in order.\n\nTo characterize the combination of the application and the approval, not as a contract properly speaking, identical to a private law contract, but as a bilateral relationship creating obligations for both parties, does not prevent the Claimants from claiming compensation for the damages, if any, they suffered as a consequence of the withdrawal of the approval, provided, of course, the same is not substantially justified. To consider such claim while not characterizing the relationship in question exactly like a contract is not to enter into a different case, because the consequences of an unjustified revocation would be the same as those resulting from the breach of a contract. Moreover, while not accepting, in principle, the characterization of the application-approval combination as a contract, Respondent has put forward the reasons which, in its view, justified the licence revocation in this case, implicitly, but clearly, accepted - as stated, moreover, by Professor Delvolve - that lacking such reasons, the application\u2019s approval could not have been lawfully withdrawn.\n\n*Section II- The Issue of the Lawfulness of the Withdrawal of the Investment Application\u2019s Approval*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal has previously described the several steps taken by representatives of PT Wisma Kartika, by Mr Usman and Mr Ridho Harun, of BKPM, and ultimately by the Chairman of BKPM, which resulted, after approval by the President of the Republic, in the decision of July 9, 1980 \"concerning Revocation of Approval Termination of Capital Investment Business in the Name of PT Amco Indonesia...\" (see above, para. 110 ff.).\n\nBased on the facts and the documents thus described, to which reference is hereby made, the Tribunal will now proceed to evaluate the *procedure* followed in pronouncing the revocation, and the *grounds* on which the same was based. Such double evaluation is necessary in order for the Tribunal to find whether the revocation was decided in accordance with Indonesian law and with general principles of international law. Indeed, to be lawful, the withdrawal of an administrative act which terminates a bilateral relationship between a State and a private party, which relationship has created reciprocal legal obligations on both sides, has to satisfy two requisites:\n\n\u2014 in the first place, procedural ones, as set up by the applicable law and which are to be in accord with the fundamental principle of *due process,* which are to assure to any person or entity whose rights are affected by a revocation the right to discuss the grievances alleged against him and to defend himself against the same;\n\n\u2014 and second, the substantial requirement that the revocation be based on grounds that justify it legally.\n\nA. *The Procedure of the Revocation*\n------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nOn July 9, 1980, the day where the decision \"concerning Revocation, etc...\" was issued, as well as on May 30, 1980, the day on which the approval of the same by the President of the Republic was conveyed to BKPM, the basic provisions dealing with the implementation thereof were -and apparently, still are today - set up by Article 6 of Presidential Decree No. 54 of 1977 \"stipulated\" on October 3, 1977, and Article 13 of the Decree of Chairman of BKPM, No. 01 of 1977, dated November 3, 1977.\n\nUnder the heading *\"Sanction Provisions\",* Article 6 of Decree No. 54/1977 provides as follows:\n\nIn case the implementation of a capital investment is not in accordance with the approval and provisions as stipulated by the Government, and/or the capital investor does not fulfil the obligation to submit reports on capital investment implementation as referred to in Article 4, then the capital investor can be imposed with sanctions in accordance with the effective legislation regulations, including the revocation of the undertaking permit and/or fiscal facilities reliefs already granted.\n\nAs to Article 13 of the Chairman of BKPM\u2019s Decree 01/1977, the wording of its relevant provision (namely paras 2 and 3) is the following:\n\n*Sanctions*\n\n\u2026\n\n2. If investors in executing the capital investment are not in conformity with the approval and provisions which have been given by the Government and/or investors do not fulfil the obligation to submit report on the realization of capital investment as stipulated under Article 8 of the Decree, the said case may result in charging legal sanction against the investors in comply with the effective regulation until the revocation of all approval and permit that are issued by the Government, [sic]\n\n3. The charging of the sanction as explained under paragraph 1 above shall be informed in advance by the Capital Investment Coordination Board to the investors concerned. Whereas the charging of the sanction as stipulated under paragraph 2 above shall be preceded by the warning by the Capital Investment Coordination Board to the investors concerned maximally 3 (three) times with the 1 (one) month interim period respectively.\n\n194.\n\nIt cannot be seriously denied that these regulations were applicable to the revocation decided in the instant case. To be sure, it has been suggested by the Claimants - if not firmly contended - that the application of said regulations to the investment approval in question would be retroactive, and for this reason, unlawful. To answer this objection, counsel to Respondent relied on Decree No. 63 of 1969, dated August 5, 1969, which counsel stated \"promulgated identical express revocation authority (Copenhagen transcript, at 1219-C).\n\nThis answer is not convincing, since the approval in this case was granted on July 29, 1968, that is to say prior to the decree of August 5, 1969. But the fact of the matter is that from the point of view of substance, the State\u2019s right to withdraw the approval where the recipient does not fulfil its obligations (provided, as it will be shown hereunder, the failure is material) derives from the very nature of the legal relationship established by the application and the approval thereof; accordingly, such right of justifiable revocation existed even before the promulgation of the decree of 1969, which merely affirmed it.\n\nAs to the procedure of revocation, where it is established by regulation, it becomes applicable, like procedural provisions in general, to any revocation of a licence which comes after its promulgation, even if the approval was granted previous to the enabling regulation.\n\n195.\n\nNow, Article 13, paragraph 3 of BKPM Chairman\u2019s Decree 01/1977, cited above, provides that \"the charging of the sanction as stipulated under paragraph 2\" (that is to say in cases where the investors do not observe \"the approval and provision given by the Government and/or do not fulfil the obligations to submit report on the realization of capital investment\")... \"shall be preceded by the warning by the Capital Investment Coordination Board to the investors concerned maximally 3 (three) times with the 1 (one) month interim period respectively\".\n\nAs a matter of fact, the import of this provision is not perfectly clear. Does it mean that the revocation can be decided only after three warnings, or that this number of warnings is a maximum, which would imply that on a revocation could be decided just after one single or two warnings? Literally read, the second interpretation could be supported. However, where the sanction to be applied is a revocation, that is to say the most serious sanction to construe the provision according to its aim and purpose leads to the view that three warnings are indeed required. Moreover, such construction would better fit with the first sentence of Article 13, paragraph 3, which in respect of the sanction to be applied according to paragraph 1 (in case of intentionally misstated statements in the application or falsification of documents attached to the same) simply provides that the investor \"shall be informed in advance\", not mentioning that such information should be given more than one time.\n\n196.\n\nBe that as it may, in the instant case, *there were no warning or warnings at all.* To be sure, Respondent contends that such warnings were given by Bank Indonesia, relying in this respect on several letters from the bank to PT Amco (Resp. Exh. to CM Nos 76, 78,79, 80,83 to 86). The first of these letters (Exh. 76) is dated November 9, 1971, and the last but one (Exh. 85), May 31, 1978. None of them contains any formula that could possibly be interpreted as a warning; moreover, how could even the letter of May 31, 1978, be considered as a warning on which a licence revocation could be based more than two years later?\n\nCould a \"warning\" be found in the last letter, of September 3, 1979 (Exh. 86)? There, the bank, after having recalled two previous letters of 1978, where Report on Foreign Capital Investment realization was asked for, and stated that the same was still not received, concluded as follows:\n\nFurthermore, we need to explain here that the capital investors who do not fulfil the obligations in conveying the financial reports intended, can *incur sanctions* in accordance with Article 13 of the Capital Investment Coordinating Board\u2019s Decree No. 01/1977 dated 3 November 1977.  \nThus, for your information.\n\n197.\n\n\"Information\" is far from \"warning\". Moreover, beside the fact that even this letter preceded the revocation by more than ten months, it can by no means be considered that it was a warning, lawfully preparing the revocation, in the sense of Article 13 of the Decree 01/1977. There are, indeed, three reasons to reject such an interpretation: the so-called \"warning\" was not given by the BKPM, as provided for in Article 13; it did not indicate the sanction envisaged, which is easy to understand, since Bank Indonesia was not the authority competent to impose such sanction; and it did not indicate the reasons for which the revocation was finally decided, as it will be shown hereunder (see para. 204 ff.).\n\n198.\n\nAccordingly, this letter from Bank Indonesia could not fulfil the purpose and function of the warning, or warnings, provided for by Decree 01/1977. The purpose and function of these warnings are to give the addressee of the warnings the opportunity to remedy the failures (if any) mentioned therein; and even in cases where such remedy could not be offered or made, in fact or in law (a point which will be discussed hereunder, see paras 219, 241), to give him the opportunity to discuss the administration\u2019s grievances and to defend himself against the same.\n\nThus, the warning (or warnings) are an element of due process, rightly in the opinion of the Tribunal, established by Indonesian law to protect the investor, in particular where a sanction as heavy - and indeed, irremediable \u2014 as a revocation is envisaged against him. In the instant case, this protection was not made available to the Claimants, who were thus deprived of due process, contrary to Indonesian law as well as contrary to general principles of law.\n\n199.\n\nMoreover, infringement of the due process principle is met again when examining the manner in which the revocation was prepared, quite apart from the issue of the absence of any warning.\n\nThe meetings and documents which preceded the revocation were previously described (see above, paras 110, 115). Suffice it to recall here that the starting point of the process which resulted finally in the revocation of the licence was a letter of PT Wisma Kartika, dated April 11, 1980, which was handed over to Messrs Harun and Usman, of BKPM during a meeting held in the afternoon of April 12 (a first meeting had been held in the morning of the same day). According to Mr Usman\u2019s testimony (see above, para. 115) some checking was made by him, the same or the next day, with Bank Indonesia and the tax authorities; on April 13, 1980, a meeting which lasted about one hour was held at the BKPM offices between Messrs Tomodok and Gumillag, of PT Amco, and Messrs Harun and Usman of BKPM. The next day, April 14, PT Wisma addressed to BKPM the letter described above (see above, para. 117), which it concluded by a request to BKPM:\n\nto revoke immediately PT Amco\u2019s licence, because (they) have suffered so many losses because of it and feel it is very difficult to cooperate with them and besides that, considering also that their very small capital has been retransferred double to abroad.\n\nThen again just one day after, on April 15, Mr Usman handed over to Mr Harun the \"Summary of PT Amco Indonesia - PT Wisma Kartika\" (see above, para. 118), stating the \"violations\" (committed, in his view, by PT Amco Indonesia) \"towards the administrative provisions of the capital investment (law)\", and in addition, \"violations which have criminal characteristics\" and suggesting that it is necessary to review the Foreign Capital Investment which had been granted to PT Amco Indonesia.\n\nThus, three days during which one hour had been devoted to a discussion with PT Amco\u2019s representatives, seemed sufficient to Mr Usman for him to present this suggestion, which finally resulted, after a memorandum was sent on May 10, 1980, by Mr Harun to the Deputy Chairman of BKPM (see above, para. 124) and a letter was sent two days later by the Chairman of BKPM (see above, paras 125-6) in the approval of the revocation by the President and the decision of revocation of July 9, 1980 (see above, paras 127-8).\n\n200.\n\nCertainly, the delay that elapsed in reaching this decision, after Mr Usman handed over of his \"Summary\" was somewhat more reasonable than the practically instantaneous delay between his first meeting with the representatives of PT Wisma Kartika and the preparation and forwarding of the said document. However, it does not appear that during this second period, any supplementary investigations were made by the BKPM or by the President\u2019s staff; in any event, no evidence has been offered of such investigations. In particular, it was not even alleged that PT Amco Asia, or any other Claimant, was offered the opportunity to discuss the matter again, to produce documents and/or to defend themselves; nothing more, in this respect, than the one-hour meeting with Mr Usman on April 13, 1980.\n\n201.\n\nLeaving alone the fact that the initiative for this \"procedure\" of revocation was taken by PT Wisma, a company which the Respondent maintained was independent from the State, and therefore not entrusted with any governmental or administrative competence or power, and a company which had a severe dispute with PT Amco (this not being the best guarantee of its objectivity), the Tribunal is bound to conclude that said \"procedure\" did not grant to the Claimants due process of law.\n\nAccordingly, this procedure was contrary, not only to the Indonesian regulations concerning the warning or warnings to be given before a revocation of an investment authorization, but to the general and fundamental principle of due process as well. This finding by itself allows the Tribunal to conclude that the revocation of the approval of the investment application was unlawfully and therefore wrongfully decided, whatever the reasons on which it was based, and even if, as a matter of substance, said reasons could have justified it.\n\n202.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal believes it is necessary to examine and evaluate these reasons, and it will do so hereunder (see para. 204 ff.).\n\nBeforehand, two objections presented by the Respondent against the consequences thus drawn from the procedure of revocation are to be examined.\n\ni) The Respondent has argued that warning or warnings would have been useless in the circumstances of this case and consequently, that even if admitted, the lack of warning would be irrelevant - since no remedy could have been brought by the Claimants to their alleged failures, which led to the revocation.\n\nWhether this is so in fact, and whether or to what extent such remedy was needed will be seen when examining hereunder the alleged failures on which the revocation was based. Suffice it to recall here that the purpose of the warning, or warnings, is not only to allow such remedies, but also to offer to the investor the opportunity to discuss the alleged failures, in order to demonstrate either that they do not exist, or that they do not justify the revocation. It could not be argued, in this respect, that discussion and defence would not have changed the administration\u2019s mind; because such argument would mean that the administration had decided in advance not to take into account any argument of the investor whatsoever, which would itself amount to a refusal of due process.\n\nii) Secondly, the Respondent argued that due process is now granted to Claimants by this very arbitral procedure of the ICSID. Such argument cannot be sustained. It is obvious that this Tribunal cannot substitute itself for the Indonesian Government, in order to cancel the revocation and restore the licence; such actions are not even claimed, and it is more than doubtful that this kind of *restitutio in integrum* could be ordered against a sovereign State.\n\nAccordingly, the revocation has been definitively decided, and the investor has been definitively deprived of its right to operate and to exploit the enterprise that it had been authorized to set up. Whatever compensation the investor can hope to get, that means at the least that the nature of its rights was changed against its will, and such change has been decided upon without its being granted due process *and the decision to' withdraw, the authorization* cannot be remedied by the arbitral procedure.\n\n203.\n\nIt thus remains that the revocation was unlawful in respect of the procedure that resulted in it.\n\nThe Tribunal will now examine whether the reasons on which the revocation was based *could* have justified it.\n\nB. *The Reasons of the Investment Application\u2019s Withdrawal*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe decision of the Chairman of BKPM \"concerning Revocation of Approval/Termination of Capital Investment Business in the name of PT Amco Indonesia in the framework of Law Number 1 Year 1967 concerning foreign capital investment (pma)\" (Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. IV No. 91) was previously described (see above, para. 129). It is here recalled that this decision was based on two grounds, namely:\n\n\u2014 that by the Sub-Lease Agreements dated October 15, 1969 and October 13, 1970, PT Amco Indonesia delivered the management of Hotel Kartika Plaza to PT Aeropacific, thus not fulfilling itself the obligations as stipulated in the Lease and Management Contract concluded with PT Wisma Kartika on April 22, 1968;\n\n\u2014 that PT Amco Indonesia:\n\nhas only deposit *(sic)* its capital as much as US $1,399,000, which consisted of loan for the amount of US $1,000,000 and own capital (equity) for the sum of US $399,000 is obligated to invest its capital the amount of US $4,000,000, which consisted of own capital (equity) at the sum of US $3,000,000 - and loan for US$1,000,000;\n\nwhile:\n\nthe fulfilment of the remainder of the capital was executed by PT Aeropacific.... a national company, therefore the said capital is not foreign capital (fresh capital), as stipulated in Article 2 Law No. 1 Year 1967.\n\n205.\n\nThus, the other grounds for a suggested \"review\" of the authorization put forward in Mr Usman\u2019s Summary (namely: the failure to report to Bank Indonesia concerning transfers abroad; the failure to report BKPM concerning the realization of Amco\u2019s capital investment; alleged tax manipulation; assets owned by the hotel allegedly given in guarantee for obtaining a loan, without the approval of the owner, PT Wisma Kartika; see above, paras 118-23), are not mentioned in the Decision of July 9, 1980, in spite of said grounds having been, in essence, repeated in Mr Harun\u2019s Memorandum of May 10, 1980 (Resp. Exh. to CM vol. IV No. 89; see above, para. 14), and in the Request for Guidance presented on May 12, 1980 by the Chairman of BKPM to the President of the Republic (Resp. Exh. to CM, No. 90; see above, para. 126).\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal does not have to consider these grounds, since they have not been relied upon in the legal act which pronounced the revocation.\n\nIt might be that the Chairman of BKPM considered that it was not necessary to refer to them, because he may have thought that the two grounds ultimately invoked (i.e. the transfer of the management to Aeropacific and the non fulfilment of the obligation to invest in the amount promised) were sufficient to justify the revocation. However, it might also be that the Chairman considered that in the circumstances of the case, the other grievances would not have justified the revocation.\n\nBe that as it may, it is not for the Tribunal to build hypotheses, nor to try to guess thoughts which the author of the revocation did not express. The Tribunal has to evaluate the lawfulness of a legal decision and the Tribunal can do so by evaluating it as it is, and as it has been drafted by the Indonesian authority that issued it; the Tribunal has not to supplement the decision in question by adding to it grounds which it does not contain, although they were invoked in the preparatory documents of the decision.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will consider only the two grounds of revocation on which the decision is expressly based.\n\na) *Transfer to PT Aeropacific of the management of the hotel*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nIt has been recited previously (see above, paras 53-77) that by the \"First Sub-Lease Agreement\" of October 15, 1969, which succeeded to the \"Sub-Lease Agreement of Intent\" of August 22, 1969, and was subsequently replaced by the \"Second Sub-Lease Agreement\" of October 13, 1970, PT Amco Indonesia entrusted first the group Pulitzer-Garuda-KLM, then PT Aeropacific with the management and operation of the hotel; in addition, the \"Second Sub-Lease Agreement\" called for Aeropacific to \"complete the construction of the hotel and furnish, equip and fit the same in all respects in accordance with Howard Johnson\u2019s standards...\".\n\nIt was also recalled that PT Amco and PT Wisma Kartika approved and signed these three successive agreements; and that the management and operation of the Hotel by PT Aeropacific ceased definitively on June 1, 1978, when Inkopad took over possession and control of the Wisma Kartika property and undertook its management.\n\n207.\n\nThe Decision of Revocation of July 9, 1980 deals in the following terms with the issue of these agreements:\n\n2. that based on the Sub-Lease Agreement dated October 15, 1969 jo *(sic)* October 13, 1970 (obviously, the two successive sub-lease agreements previously mentioned are thus referred to) PT Amco Indonesia (Lessor) delivered the management of Hotel Kartika Plaza to PT Aeropacific Hotel Corp. (Lessee), therefore it is not PT Amco Indonesia which fulfilled the obligations as stipulated in the said Lease and Management Contract as stated in dictum 1 above (i.e., \"Lease and Management Contract in the field of operating hotel Kartika Plaza between PT Wisma Kartika and Amco Corporation, U.S.A, dated April 22, 1968\").\n\n208.\n\nThere is some ambiguity in this wording. Indeed, it is not perfectly clear, at least in the English translation, whether the term \"as stipulated\" in the quoted sentence of the revocation refers to the personal fulfilment by PT Amco of the obligations resulting from the Lease and Management Agreement, or simply to these obligations.\n\nIn any event, the conclusion by PT Amco Indonesia of the two successive sub-lease agreements could by no means be considered as an infringement of the initial Lease and Management Agreement, for a very simple reason: as previously recalled (see above, paras 61-70), PT Wisma Kartika and Amco Asia Corporation approved in writing and signed, on the last page of the contractual documents themselves, both sub-lease agreements (see Resp. Exh. to CM at 13; and 26 at 29). In both instances, the approval is expressed in terms which could not be clearer, and without any restriction or reservation (\"approve and will respect\", in the first sub-lease agreement; \"approve of and agree to be bound by\" on the second one). Moreover, it is worthwhile to underscore that both \"approvals\" are expressly given \"also in case PT Amco Indonesia\u2019s interest would be transferred to a third party\"; such clause would be incompatible with a *de jure* prohibition, by the Indonesian law of contract, of a transfer of the rights, interests and obligations deriving from the initial Lease and Management Agreement; as a matter of fact, no evidence of such prohibition has been offered nor brought. In addition, it would be difficult to imagine such a prohibition by the law of contract, whereas in the instant case, the lessor agrees to the subleases.\n\nAccordingly, no violation of the Lease and Management Agreement in respect of the contractual obligations deriving of the same existed; thus, the revocation could not be justified on this basis.\n\n209.\n\nIt remains however to find whether the obligation for the investor to fulfil personally its obligations results from the law and regulations governing the investment; and if so, whether in the factual situation that prevailed at the date of the revocation, the sub-lease agreements could be invoked to justify the same, on the basis of principles or provisions concerning the licence and prohibiting, ex-hypothesis, the transfer of the investor\u2019s rights, interests and obligations deriving from the same.\n\n210.\n\nRespondent relies, in this respect, on Decree of the President of the Republic No. 63/1969, dated August 5, 1969 (Resp. Fact. App. C, Att. 3), No. 21/1973, dated May 26, 1973, and *(ibid)* No. 54/1977, dated October 3, 1977 (Resp. Fact. App. C, Att. 1, at 55).\n\nArticle 4 of Decree No. 63/1969 in particular provides as follows:\n\nIf the capital investment plan is not implemented in accordance with the approval that has been granted, this may result in the withdrawal of the business license that has been issued...\n\nA similar provision may be found in Article 6 of Decree No. 21/1973. Finally, Article 4 of Decree No. 54/1977 (whose translations into English, as respectively filed by Claimants and by Respondent are slightly different, those differences not changing, however, the substantial meaning of the relevant provision) provides that (para. 1):\n\neach investor in the framework of Act No. 1 of 1967... is obliged to carry out his capital investment, in accordance with the regulations agreed upon (or, in the Claimants\u2019 translation, in accordance with provisions already approved: see Cl. Doc. No. 32).\n\nand that (para. 2):\n\neach change in the execution of the agreement mentioned in paragraph (1) must be approved beforehand by the Chairman of the BKPM (Respt\u2019s translation).\n\nThese provisions of Decree No. 54/1977 are to be combined with the one already cited (see above, para. 193) of Article 13 of the subsequent Decree No. 01/1977 of the Chairman of BKPM, according to which:\n\nif investors in executing the capital investment are not in conformity with the approval and provision which have been given by the Government... the said case may result in charging legal sanction against the investors... until the revocation of all approval and permit that are issued by the Government.\n\n211.\n\nOn the basis of these provisions (not expressly referring, however, to the last one), Respondent contends that the sub-lease agreements having resulted in the non-fulfilment by the investor himself (or rather by the Indonesian PT it established of the obligations undertaken in the approved investment application, the investor changed the implementation or execution of the investment as approved, thus justifying the revocation of the licence.\n\nIn essence, Claimants oppose to this the following (see Reply to Indonesia\u2019s CM at 78 ff., 96 ff.):\n\n\u2014 only the Indonesian Parliament has the power to cancel investment licences;\n\n\u2014 the administrative regulations cited by Indonesia as empowering cancellation could not supersede parliamentary authority, and in any event were promulgated after Claimant\u2019s investment was approved; moreover, both Decree No. 63/1969 and Decree No. 21/1973 had been revoked at the time that Indonesia cancelled Claimant\u2019s investment licence (namely, Decree No. 63/1969 by Decree No. 21/1973, and Decree No. 21/1973 by Decree No. 54/1977);\n\n\u2014 the sub-lease agreement between PT Amco and Aeropacific was merely a sub-contract, not a transfer of PT Amco\u2019s obligations to Aeropacific;\n\n\u2014 finally, PT Wisma Kartika having approved the sub-lease agreements, the Government could not base on the same the revocation of the licence.\n\n212.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the argument based on Article 21 of Law No. 1 of 1967, according to which the Government cannot decide nationalization or similar measures as long as a law (which in one of the translations filed is called an \"Act of Parliament\") has not declared that the interest of the State requires such a measure.\n\nAs already noted (see above, para. 190), Respondent does not effectively base its claim on the characterization of the licence\u2019s revocation as a nationalization. Moreover, the Claimants present this measure as a \"breach of contract\", which is one of the bases of their claims. Accordingly, they admit necessarily that if the failure to fulfil their obligations, as alleged by Respondent, could be established, the revocation of the licence could be justified, no act of Parliament declaring the interest of the State being required to that effect.\n\nAs to the alleged abrogation of Decree No. 63/1969 by Decree No. 21/1973, the Tribunal does not find in the latter any express provision of that kind. On the other hand, Decree 54/1977 does start with the following sentence: \"By revoking the Decree of the President Number 21 of 1973 concerning the Principle Rules of Capital Investment Procedure\". Accordingly, it seems that at the date of revocation, Decree Nos 63/1969 and 54/1977 were in force, while Decree No. 21/1973 was not.\n\nIn any event, even supposing (although no clear evidence has been brought in this respect) that at said date, Decree No. 63/1969 was not in force (for instance, because it would be considered as having been tacitly abrogated by Decree No. 54/1977) such interpretation would not fundamentally change the contents of Indonesian law on the matter here discussed.\n\nIndeed, as previously shown (see above, paras 210-11), Decree No. 54/1977, combined with Decree No. 01/1977 of the Chairman of BKPM, would suffice to justify the revocation where the investor is \"not in conformity with the approval and provision which have been given by the Government\".\n\n213.\n\nNor does the Tribunal accept Claimant\u2019s objection, that Decree No. 54/1977 (and probably in the same way, the Chairman of BKPM\u2019s Decree No. 01/1977) should not be applied in the instant case, because the licence had been granted before these regulations were promulgated. It has already been said that the procedural provisions of said regulations were applicable, and the Tribunal expresses the same opinion as to their substantial provisions.\n\nIndeed, to provide that the licence could be withdrawn where the investor does not fulfil the obligations he has undertaken, is but the confirmation of a principle which must be accepted even if there was no express provisions to that effect. Claimants, which contend that the application-approval combination is a contract, cannot deny it, since a contract can be terminated by one of the parties where the other party does not fulfil its obligations. Even if - as the Tribunal does - one refuses to characterize the application and the approval as being identical to a private law contract, it remains that the application-approval combination is closely comparable to a contract; accordingly, even if, strictly speaking, the substantial provisions of the Decrees of 1977 would not be applicable, the lawfulness of a revocation based on the non-fulfilment by the investor of his obligation must be admitted as a matter of principle.\n\n214.\n\nDid such a non-fulfilment result from the sub-lease agreements?\n\nTo answer this question, it must be said at the outset that the licence to invest is necessarily granted by the Government in consideration of the industrial, technical, financial and moral attributes of an applicant. Consequently, one could not imagine that once the approval is received, the applicant is free to assign it to another person or entity, without the Governments approval, the same amounting, indeed, to a new licence. Accordingly, a non-authorized transfer of the obligations undertaken by the investor should be considered an infringement by him of his obligations.\n\nIn the case at hand, Claimants do not deny this principle, and one may even think that they admit it, at least implicitly. Indeed, they contend that the sub-lease agreements were not transfers to Aeropacific of Amco\u2019s and PT Amco\u2019s obligations, but merely sub-contracts, which were contemplated in the initial Lease and Management Agreement, annexed to the application, so that the Government had approved such sub-contracts, so to speak, in advance.\n\n215.\n\nSuch contention meets serious difficulties.\n\nIt is true to say that normally a sub-contract is not a transfer or an assignment of the main contract, since the main contractor remains responsible towards the other party for the adequate performance by the sub-contractor of the obligations the latter has undertaken. Moreover a subcontractor is usually entrusted with the partial, not the total performance of the tasks provided for in the main contract, as it was here the case, in particular by means of the Second Sub-Lease Agreement; and even where the sub-contractor is entrusted with the performance of all the tasks forming the subject matter of the main contract - which may happen in some cases -the main contractor keeps a power of supervision over the sub-contractor, the exercise of which constitutes a guarantee for the benefit of the other party to the main contract.\n\nFurthermore, the principle of personal fulfilment of the investor\u2019s obligations is not merely a matter of responsibility towards the host State; it is postulated in order to insure the latter of a realization of the investment to a standard it was entitled to expect, given the industrial, technical, financial and moral characteristics of the applicant, which were taken into account when the State approved the application.\n\n216.\n\nConsequently, it could be concluded, in principle, that the total transfer by the investor of the actual performance of his obligations towards the host State, without the latter\u2019s consent, amounts to a material failure of the investor\u2019s obligations, which might justify the revocation of the licence.\n\n217.\n\nNevertheless, taking into account the whole set of facts and agreements as established in the instant case, the Tribunal does not adhere to this conclusion, for the reasons stated hereunder.\n\ni) As previously stated, PT Wisma expressly agreed to the sublease contracts now criticized by the Government of Indonesia, which shows PT Amco\u2019s good faith when executing said contracts.\n\nTo be sure, as the Respondent points out, PT Wisma Kartika is a company having its own legal personality, distinct from the Republic of Indonesia. However, it is hardly credible that the Government was not informed about the two sub-lease agreements, during the long period of their actual implementation (that is to say from October 15, 1969, to June 1, 1978: see above, paras 51-71).\n\nii) This knowledge by the Government of the non-personal fulfilment by PT Amco of its obligations (which amounted to their non-personal fulfilment by Amco Asia) became obvious when Inkopad took over the possession and the management of the hotel from PT Aeropacific on June 1, 1978. It is hard to imagine that in any event, and at the latest at this date, the Government was not aware of the fact that during the preceding years, the sub-leases were in operation.\n\niii) Likewise, it cannot be imagined that the army was not aware of the fact that soon after having taken over the possession and management of the hotel, Inkopad authorized PT Wisma and PT Amco to enter into the \"Profit Sharing Agreement\" (see above, para. 78-C1. ff.) according to which \"the management of the Kartika Plaza Land and Building with all its contents shall be carried out, implemented, and the full responsibility of the second party\" (i.e. PT Amco Asia). This clause meant that as from the date of this agreement (October 6, 1978), PT Amco recovered the management and the operation of the hotel, and that Inkopad did not consider it was unable to do so, due to the non-personal fulfilment of its obligations during the period of implementation of the Sub-Lease Agreements.\n\niv) Finally, it is to be stressed that the revocation of the\u2019 licence was decided *two years* after PT Amco was again personally fulfilling its obligations. Therefore, even admitting, in principle, that the non-personal fulfilment of the investor\u2019s obligations can justify the revocation of his licence, it cannot be admitted that such a sanction can be invoked for a failure in the past, that is, which ceased two years earlier, and that ceased not only without any objection by the Government, but due to the initiative of a body (Inkopad) strongly linked with the Government.\n\n218.\n\nBy taking into account these facts and agreements, the Tribunal does not express any findings on the existence or non-existence, in Indonesian or international law, of waiver or estoppel, which is disputed between the parties.\n\nIndeed, there is no need to say that these facts and agreements constitute a waiver by the Government to rely on the sub-leases in order to justify the revocation, nor that due to these facts the Government was estopped from invoking the sub-leases to that effect. Suffice it to say that due to these facts and agreements, the failure of the investor, during a past period of time, to personally fulfil its obligations, *was not material at the time of the revocation,* so that it did not justify the same.\n\nIndeed, like the termination of a contract by one of the parties, the revocation of the investment application\u2019s approval by the host State can be justified only by *material* failures on the part of the investor. In the circumstances of the case, the sub-lease agreements between PT Amco Asia and PT Aeropacific were not, in any event at the date of the revocation, a material failure justifying the same.\n\n219.\n\nA last remark is to be made in this respect.\n\nThe Tribunal has previously noted (see above, para. 198) that one of the purposes and functions of the warnings before the \"charging\" of a sanction, provided for by the relevant Indonesian regulations, was to offer the investor the opportunity to remedy the failure alleged against him. Now, how could the investor remedy a failure which has ceased two years before the revocation was decided? At the date of the revocation, remedy had been already brought, and it is in conformity with the spirit of the relevant Indonesian regulations to decide, as the Tribunal does do, that a remedied failure is not a material failure, and therefore, cannot justify the revocation.\n\nb) *Insufficiency of the investment*\n------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nThe second alleged reason for the licence\u2019s revocation was the insufficiency of the investment realized by the Claimants, as compared with the investment promised by Amco Asia.\n\nAs previously recalled (see above, para. 204) it is stated in this respect in the decision of July 9, 1980, that the amount of the realized investment made by PT Amco Indonesia was US $1,399,000, out of which US $1,000,000 consisted of a loan and US $399,000 of own capital (equity), while the investor was obligated to invest US $4,000,000, namely US $3,000,000 consisting in own capital and $1,000,000 in a loan. As to the investment above of US $1,399,000, it was realized by PT Aeropacific, which is a national company, so that the capital it invested was not foreign capital.\n\n221.\n\nThe amount of the investment realized, be it by PT Amco or PT Aeropacific was discussed at length in the pleadings, documents filed, expert testimonies and oral argument.\n\nBefore coming to the examination of this controversial amount, it is necessary to make a decision as to the criteria of the investment which corresponds to the requirements of Law No. 1 of 1967 and other relevant\u2019 Indonesian regulations and to the obligations undertaken by Amco Asia Corporation in its application.\n\nThese criteria are of four kinds:\n\n\u2014 the origin of the investment;  \n\u2014 its composition;  \n\u2014 its amount;  \n\u2014 the period during which it was to be completed.\n\n222.\n\nAs to the *origin,* the Decision of Revocation states that the portion of the investment realized by PT Aeropacific cannot be taken into account, said company being an Indonesian one, so that the capital it put into the enterprise was not foreign fresh capital.\n\nThe Tribunal will accept the conclusion of this reasoning, if not fully the reasoning itself.\n\n223.\n\nAs to the \"nationality\" of PT Aeropacific, it is right to say that the latter was a company organized and existing under the law of Indonesia, established and domiciled in Jakarta; accordingly, would the criterion of a company\u2019s nationality, as generally accepted in municipal law and international law (see, as to the latter, in principle, decision of the International Court of Justice in the *Barcelona Traction* case: icj Reports, 1964, at 4) be applied, PT Aeropacific should be considered as an Indonesia company.\n\nHowever, it is not this general criterion to which Indonesian law refers in order to define, *in respect of investment,* Indonesian and foreign enterprises, nor - what seems to be actually relevant - domestic or foreign capital.\n\n224.\n\nIndeed, Article 1 of Law No. 1/1967 - which is the basic text in this respect - provides as follows:\n\nArticle 1.\n\nCapital investment in this law denotes only direct investment of foreign capital made in accordance with or based upon the provisions of this law for the purposes of establishing enterprises in Indonesia, with the understanding that the owner of the capital directly bears the risk of the investment.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this provisions does not define a foreign *enterprise;* it defines the investment of foreign *capital,* such definitions being based on the conformity of the investment with the provisions of Law No. 1/1967, and on the establishment by the investor of an enterprise in Indonesia.\n\nThe definition of foreign as well as of national enterprises in the field of investment is to be found in Law No. 6 of 1968 (Resp. Exh. vol. V, No. 113). Article 3, Secs 1 and 2 of this law provide as follows:\n\nArticle 3.\n\n(1) A national enterprise is an enterprise of which at least 51% of the domestic capital invested therein is owned by the State and/or National Private Enterprise. The percentage shall be increased so that on January 1, 1974, it will amount to not less than 75%.\n\n(2) A foreign enterprise is an enterprise which does not satisfy the condition of Section (1) of this article.\n\nBy virtue of this provision, PT Aeropacific was not an Indonesian enterprise; indeed, 51% of its capital was owned by Mr Pulitzer, an American citizen and resident, 25-5% by klm, a Dutch company, and only 24% by Garuda, an Indonesian company. Accordingly, the capital it invested to complete the construction of the hotel and to temporarily operate it did not form a foreign investment in the sense of Law No. 1/1967, because it had not been invested \"in accordance with or based upon the provisions of this law\", nor \"for the purpose of establishing enterprises in Indonesia\", since PT Amco Indonesia was already established, when the First Sub-Lease was concluded.\n\n225.\n\nThere is no contradiction between this characterization of PT Aeropacific as a foreign company, in respect of the legislation on investment, and the refusal to characterize the investment it made in the Kartika Plaza as a foreign investment, It results in effect from Article 1, paragraph 1 of Law No. 6 of 1968 that \"Domestic Capital\" may be owned \"either by the State or by National Private or *Foreign Private Enterprises domiciled in Indonesia\"* (emphasis provided). Such was here the case, the capital of PT Aeropacific was, in the sense of the investment legislation, domestic capital owned by a foreign private enterprise.\n\n226.\n\nAs a result, the funds utilized by PT Aeropacific in order to complete the construction and to temporarily operate the Kartika Plaza Hotel did not constitute an investment of foreign capital, as understood by Indonesian law, and consequently cannot be taken into account in the calculation of the foreign capital effectively invested by the Claimants.\n\nIndeed, the Claimants rely on the fact that the Aeropacific funds were to be credited to a special account, opened in the name of PT Amco, so that formally, it was PT Amco that invested them. The Tribunal does not find that even if it had been fully applied, this mechanism of pure accountancy could have changed the legal characterization of the investment made by PT Aeropacific; moreover, it results from the unchallenged affidavit delivered by Mr Ruitar (Cl. Doc. No. 100, at 2), that after first small deposits, the crediting of the PT Aeropacific funds in PT Amco\u2019s account did not continue.\n\n227.\n\nFor the reasons exposed, the Tribunal decided that the funds put into the construction and operation of the hotel by Aeropacific Group cannot be taken into account in order to establish whether the Claimants have fulfilled their obligation to invest foreign capital, as undertaken in the application.\n\n228.\n\nThe *second criterion* is the composition of the investment.\n\nIn this respect, the disputed issue is whether a loan can be included in the investment of foreign capital as promised by Amco Asia in the application for investment approval.\n\nThe Tribunal will answer this question in the negative, for the following reasons.\n\ni) No investment consisting of a loan is mentioned in Amco Asia\u2019s application. It has been stated above (see above, para. 21) that in the initial application, dated May 6, 1968, it was required that the capital of PT Amco was to be US $3,000,000, \"all of which (representing) shares capital divided into three hundred (300) shares with a nominal value of US $10,000 each\". The amended application, dated May 13, 1968 (see above, para. 28) did not change the amount of the capital, nor its nature. It was again stated that the same would be share capital; only the nominal value of the shares (US $100) and their number (30,000) were changed.\n\nIn fact, the Decision of Revocation states that Amco was obligated to invest US $3,000,000 in own capital and US $1,000,000 in loan capital, thus apparently referring to the Lease and Management Agreement concluded between Amco and PT Wisma, where Amco undertook to invest \"up to the sum of US $3,000,000\" as \"Equity Capital Investment\", and \"up to US $1,000,000\" as \"Loan Capital Investment\" (see above, para. 11). However, it is the application on the basis of which the licence was granted, not the lease agreement, that defines the investor\u2019s obligations: indeed, the legal links between the investor and the host State do not derive from the lease agreement, which is a contract between two companies (be it one of them strongly linked with the State) but from the combination formed by the application and the approval thereof.\n\nii) Moreover, Article 2 of Law No. 1/1967, which defines foreign capital in its framework, does not mention loans among the three elements which may compose said capital (Section Facts, para. 7): this would in any event suffice to exclude loans from the foreign capital that the applicant undertook to invest.\n\nIn oral argument, Claimants objected that subsequent to the licence being granted in the instant case, the Indonesian administration\u2019s practice became more flexible, and admitted that loans could be included in the authorized investment. Not entering into an examination of such allegation in fact, the Tribunal cannot accept this argument, since such an authorization was not granted to Amco. Moreover, would one contend that it has been implicitly granted, because the lease agreement, attached to the application, mentioned \"Loan Capital\" of US $1,000,000, the consequence would be that the total investment promised by Amco, not merely towards PT Wisma, but towards the host State as well, would have been of US $4,000,000, out of which US $3,000,000 has to be \"Equity Capital\". The obligation to invest US $3,000,000 as equity capital would be unchanged.\n\nSuch was the only obligation clearly undertaken in the Application, and accepted by the State when granting the authorization; Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that to find whether the investor has fulfilled this obligation, only foreign capital as defined in Article 2 of Law No. 1/1967 is to be taken into account.\n\n229.\n\nThe *third criterion* for deciding whether this obligation has been fulfilled is precisely the amount that the applicant undertook to invest.\n\nThe discussion concerned here the meaning of the words \"up to\", preceding, in the lease agreement, the total amount of the investment to be made by Amco, as well as the \"Equity Capital\" portion and the \"Loan Capital\" one. Do these words mean that the amounts indicated were ceilings, rather than the subject-matter of the investor\u2019s obligation?\n\nThe question is not relevant. Indeed, the investor\u2019s obligation towards the State is not defined by the lease agreement, but by the approved application. Now, the same does not contain the words \"up to\". It simply states, as already mentioned, that the share capital of the Indonesian company to be established will be of US $3,000,000.\n\n230.\n\nThus, the applicant undertook to invest the sum of US $3,000,000.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal has to find whether this sum was effectively invested, arid if such finding is in the negative, whether the difference between the promised and the realized investment was sufficiently material to justify the revocation, in the circumstances of the case.\n\n231.\n\nBeforehand, the *fourth* (and last) *criterion* of examination is to be defined; how long was the period of time before the end of which the applicant undertook to realize the investment?\n\n232.\n\nIt has been set out in the recital of facts (see para. 21) that according to the Application, the capital of the Indonesian company to be established (i.e. PT Amco Indonesia) was to be \"deposited stage by stage...\". An Attachment V to which reference was made in the Application, but which was not filed with the Tribunal by Claimants, nor by Respondent, did probably indicate these \"stages\" as well as the total period of time during which the investment was to be realized.\n\nHowever, as also recalled in the recital of facts (see above, para. 32) in their final version, executed before Notary Abdul Latief in Notarial Document No. 106, dated December 13, 1968 (see Cl. Doc. No. 10), and approved by the Minister of Justice on January 29, 1969, the Articles of Incorporation of PT Amco Indonesia provided that:\n\nthe entire unissued portion of shares must be issued within a period of ten years, beginning today, unless this time period should be extended by those responsible, or if required at the request of the Board of Directors.\n\nNo evidence of any such extension having been produced, the Tribunal is bound to assume and to admit that the full capital of PT Amco Indonesia (that is to say the investment to be made) was to be paid within ten years from December 13, 1968.\n\n233.\n\nTo be sure, the direct purpose of Articles of Incorporation is not to define the investor\u2019s obligation towards the host State, but the obligations of the shareholders in their mutual relationships. Nonetheless, one may presume that when establishing the time period provided for the shares to be fully paid, those who executed the Articles of Incorporation took into account the time period of realization of the investment, as provided for in Attachment to the Application.\n\nHowever, it must be added that the Articles of Incorporation having reserved a possible extension of the time period during which the shares were to be issued, and this provision having been approved by the Ministry of Justice, it may be assumed that there was some flexibility in the time period granted for the realization of the investment as well: this remark will be taken into account when deciding whether some delay in said realization, if such delay did in fact occur, was a material failure justifying the revocation of the licence.\n\n234.\n\nTo conclude this examination of the legal criteria of fulfilment of the obligation to invest, the Tribunal will say that the Claimants were, in principle, obligated to realize *themselves* an investment of US $3,000,000, composed by the *elements listed in Article 2 of Law No. 1/1967* (and therefore not including any portion of \"loan capital\" nor the monies invested by PT Aeropacific) within a period of *ten years from January 29, 1969.*\n\n235.\n\nThe two basic documents respectively filed by the parties in order to establish the amount of the investment realized by Claimants (and in addition, as far as the Claimants are concerned, that they'allegedly \"caused\" Aeropacific to realize) are:\n\n\u2014 by the Claimants, the report of Mr Gerald S. Nemeth, from Nemeth/ Bolton, chartered accountants of 601 West Broadway, Vancouver, BC (Cl. Doc. No. 64);\n\n\u2014 by the Respondent, the report of Touche Ross & Co, certified public accountants of 1900 M. Street NW, Washington DC (Resp. Exh. vol. V, No. 113).\n\nBoth reports were explained, discussed and in some respects supplemented, during the hearings held in March 1984 in Copenhagen, by the oral testimonies of Messrs Gerald S. Nemeth, called by Claimants, and Thomas Bintinger, called by Respondent.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal recalls that in their Reply to Counter-Memorial (at 91-5), then in oral argument, Claimants argued that, in their view, there were four methods for calculating the realized investment of US $3,000,000.\n\nThese calculations were contested by Respondent (see in particular Rejoinder on the Merits, at 4.1) and discussed by Messrs Touche Ross in their report and by Mr Thomas Bintinger in his oral testimony, as to the methods followed and as to the data utilized.\n\n236.\n\nBefore coming to the figures, the Tribunal wishes to present some remarks on the legal aspects of the methods of calculation, and on the source and nature of the data.\n\ni) On the first point, the Tribunal shares Respondent\u2019s and Messrs Touche Ross\u2019 views concerning the monetary contribution of PT Aeropacific to the construction and, as the case might be, the operation of the hotel. The Tribunal refers, in this respect, to its previously presented analysis (see above, para. 233 ff.) which showed that the funds brought by PT Aeropacific cannot be characterized as foreign capital in the sense of Law No. 1/1967.\n\nLikewise, for the previously stated reasons, loans made to PT Amco are not to be taken into account, notwithstanding the possible characterization of loans as equity capital in the framework of general accountancy theories, as exposed by Mr Nemeth in oral testimony.\n\nHowever, PT Amco having been discharged from its liabilities under the 1969 abn loan obtained in this way revenue which was capitalized over a period of time on a deferred basis. This revenue, fully capitalized, is considered as a portion of the investment, as it will be shown hereunder.\n\nTo sum up, the Tribunal repeats that the only elements to be taken into account in order to establish the amount of the investment are those which are listed in Article 2 of Law No. 1/1967 (see above, paras 228, 234).\n\nii) Messrs Touche Ross & Co present in their report general remarks on the \"reliability of data\" (at 1-3). As to the instant case, these remarks are applied to the financial statements of PT Amco (December 31, 1978), PT Aeropacific (December 31, 1978) and PT Wisma Kartika (December 31, 1977). According to Touche Ross, these documents do not satisfy all the requirements of reliable data; in particular, the expert notes that PT Amco\u2019s financial statements as per December 31, 1978 \"were apparently prepared by the Company; no accountant\u2019s report was included\".\n\nAs a matter of principle, the Tribunal will not challenge these remarks. However, it has to say it is difficult to strictly share, in the instant case, the *onus probandi* in respect of the amount of the investment realized. The insufficiency of the investment is relied on by Respondent, to justify the revocation of the licence, so that it could be said that it is to it to prove said insufficiency, and indeed, Respondent did its best to assist the Tribunal in this respect.\n\nOn their side, Claimants were obligated to invest a certain amount of capital, so that they had to contribute as well to the Tribunal\u2019s investigations as to the effective realization of the promised investment, and so they did.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal is bound to utilize documents provided their alleged incorrectness is not established merely by general rules of accountancy, but by factual evidence directly applicable to them. The Tribunal does not find that such direct evidence of incorrectness was brought by Respondent as to the numbers mentioned in the financial statements and in the Nemeth Bolton report, filed by Claimants.\n\nAccordingly, these numbers will be taken into account hereunder, notwithstanding several adjustments or exclusions which will be indicated in due course.\n\niii) The Tribunal cannot accept the first, second and fourth methods alternatively proposed by Claimants for calculating the investment.\n\nThe first two methods take into account the alleged investment made by PT Aeropacific, which is to be excluded, as previously decided.\n\nThe fourth one is based on PT Wisma\u2019s balance sheet as per December 31, 1977, which \"shows (according to Claimants) that PT Wisma Kartika attributed Rp. 1,499,422,569, or US $3,613,065 at then applicable rates of exchange, of capital invested in the hotel to its partner PT Amco (Cl. Doc. 58 at 11)\". Now, no evidence has been produced as to the elements taken into account by PT Wisma to establish this number, which prevents the Tribunal from checking and verifying whether it corresponds to the legal criteria of calculation previously defined.\n\n237.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will base its examination and discussion on the \"third\" method proposed by Claimants (Reply to CM, at 93-5), which:\n\nis - they explain - to ignore the Aeropacific balance sheet altogether and count as foreign capital only PT Amco\u2019s paid-in capital plus retained earnings in the form of (i) rent which PT Amco forbore under the Sub-Lease Agreement in consideration for Aeropacific\u2019s part of the hotel and (ii) undistributed profits of PT Amco reported on its balance sheet for 1978 (Counter-Memorial F, App. 8-25).\n\n238.\n\nExcluding any computation of PT Aeropacific\u2019s investment and klm\u2019s loans, the figures mentioned by Messrs Nemeth/Bolton in their report, which do not take into account PT Wisma\u2019s balance sheet (that is to say, the figures corresponding to the \"third method\" suggested by Claimants) are as follows:\n\nUS $\n\n1. Issued share capital as shown in December 31, 1978 balance sheet : 1,399,000  \n2. Undistributed profits to December 31, 1977 : 274,387  \n3. Undistributed profits for 1978 : 48,642  \n4. Undistributed profits for 1979 : 163,423  \n5. Undistributed profits for 1980 : 40,856  \n6. Unamortized balance of the US $1,000,000 ABN loan : 451,329  \n7. Accumulated depreciation of the hotel building to December 31, 1978 (which according to Articles 2-C and 19-I-d of Law No. 1/1967 can be considered as foreign capital since the corresponding amount could have been transferred abroad; Art. 19-I-d, and instead, was reinvested: Art. 2.C) : 486,747\n\nTotal US$ : 2,864,384\n\n239.\n\nIn their report, Messrs Touche Ross revise Claimants\u2019 computations according to two \"approaches\". The Tribunal will consider merely the second one, since the first keeps a figure of US $1,357,950 as \"forebearance of gross receipts under the sublease agreement\", effectively put forward in Claimants\u2019 calculation, which in Tribunal\u2019s view should not be included since there is no evidentiary basis for it, and it is merely contrived.\n\nAccording to this \"second approach\", the revised figures should be as follows (Touche Ross report, at 16):\n\nUS$\n\n1. Share capital : 1,399,000  \n2. Retained earnings at December 31, 1977 : 274,387  \n3. Earnings for 1978 : 48,642  \n4. Deferred income December 31, 1978 : 451,329  \n5. Taxes imputed thereon at 20% : (90,266)\n\nTotal US $ : 2,083,092\n\nThe difference results from the exclusion of undistributed profits for 1979 and 1980 (163,423 + 40,856 = 204,279); from the deduction on taxes on the deferred income (90,266), and from the fact that the depreciation of the building is not taken into account (486,747). Thus, the total difference is:\n\nUS$\n\n\u2014 Undistributed profits for 1979 and 1980 : 204,279  \n\u2014 Taxes on deferred income : 90,266  \n\u2014 Depreciation : 486,747\n\nTotal US$$ : 781,292\n\n240.\n\nIn respect of this revised computation, the Tribunal accepts the exclusion of undistributed profits for 1979 and 1980 since both periods are posterior to the end of the ten years during which the investment was to be made (see above, para. 232); moreover, no accounting evidence has been brought as to 1980. The Tribunal will also accept the deduction of 20% taxes on deferred income.\n\nIt will keep the accumulated depreciation of the hotel building to December 31, 1978, deducting however from the corresponding number 20 for taxes, i.e. US $97,349.\n\nAccordingly, from the total reached above on the basis of the Nemeth-Bolton computation (i.e. US $2,864,384), the following amounts should be deducted:\n\nUS$\n\n\u2014 Undistributed profits 1979 : 163,423  \n\u2014 Undistributed profits 1980 : 40,856  \n\u2014 20% taxes on deferred income to December 31, 1980 : 90, 266  \n\u2014 20% taxes on accumulated depreciation : 97,349\n\nTotal US$ : 391,894\n\nAccordingly, the investment amount which the Tribunal finds that Claimants have produced sufficient evidence of is US $2,864,384 \u2014 391,894 = US$2,472,490.\n\nTo be sure, there is a discrepancy between this figure and the amount of US $1,657,522 which PT Amco stated, in the Jakarta Court proceedings. However, this latter amount is close to the sum of US $1,399,000 (share capital) and US $274,387 representing the undistributed promts to December 31, 1977 (see above, para. 239). The undistributed profits for 1978 were not taken into account for reasons which were not presented to the Tribunal. The Tribunal is bound to include them in its own calculation.\n\n241.\n\nIt is thus established that the Claimants did not realize an investment of US $3,000,000 in the framework of Law No. 1/1967, as promised in Amco\u2019s application.\n\nHowever, there is reasonable evidence that the insufficiency was of slightly more than l/6th of the amount Claimants had undertaken to invest (not giving them any credit for the undistributed earnings for 1979 and 1980, while it is highly probable that there were *some* profits during this period).\n\nAs such, this insufficiency is not material enough to justify the revocation of the licence, it is particularly so in the circumstances of the case, where no warnings were given to the investor before the revocation, while such warnings would have allowed it to establish that it had invested a much higher amount than the one on which the revocation is based, and possibly to complete the investment up to the promised amount.\n\nTo be sure, such completion would necessarily have been made after the end of the ten-years\u2019 delay. But here again, the supplementary delay would not have been a material failure of the investor\u2019s obligations, in particular in view of the rather flexible character of the ten-years\u2019 delay (see above, para. 233).\n\n242.\n\nTo conclude, like the sub-lease agreements, the insufficiency of investment does not justify the revocation of the licence. If needed such conclusion would be reinforced by the fact that the hotel was effectively built and is now a part of the travel and touristic facilities of the City of Jakarta.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this conclusion could be based merely on the substantial examination of the two reasons, on which the revocation decision relies. However, the Tribunal wishes to recall that independently from this examination and its conclusions, the mere lack of due process would have been an insuperable obstacle to the lawfulness of the revocation; the fact of the matter is that the revocation of the licence was unlawful in this respect, and unjustified as regards the reasons on which it is based.\n\n243.\n\nAccordingly, the second basis of the claims before the Tribunal, even if not characterized, strictly speaking, as a breach of contract, but as it is, as a failure of the host State to the obligations it undertook towards the investor, is established.\n\nThe Tribunal will now examine the liability of the Republic of Indonesia, as it results from this failure, which the State committed when revoking, by its decision of July 9, 1980, the authorization to invest granted by the decision of July 29, 1968.\n\n*Section III\u2014The Liability of the Republic of Indonesia for the Withdrawal of the Investment Authorization*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nThe withdrawal of the investment authorization, decided without due process being granted to the investor, and for reasons which did not justify it in substance, commits the liability of the Republic of Indonesia under Indonesian as well as under international law, that is to say under the two systems of law applicable in the instant case.\n\nA. *Indonesian Law*\n-------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe three provisions of the Indonesian regulations apparently in force at the date of the revocation, which provide directly for sanctions that can be decided against the investor, including the revocation of the investment\u2019s approval (namely: Art. 4 of Decree No. 63/1969, Art. 6 of Decree No. 54/77 and Art. 13 of BKPM Chairman\u2019s Decree No. 01/1977) have been previously cited (see above, para. 193).\n\nAccording to all these provisions, sanctions in general, and revocation in particular, can be decided only where the investor does not fulfil his own obligations, and in addition, according to Article 13, paragraph 3 of BKPM Chairman\u2019s Decree No. 01/1977, after at least one, and possibly three warnings have been given to the investor.\n\n246.\n\nNow, in the instant case, no warnings were given, and more generally, due process was not granted to the investor, whereas the right to due process is undoubtedly granted and protected by Indonesian law, like by the laws of all modern countries. Furthermore, no material failures to the investor\u2019s obligations justified the revocation. Accordingly, in both respects, the revocation amounted to a violation of a fundamental principle and of relevant particular provisions of Indonesian law; be it only for this reason, it committed the State\u2019s liability, in the framework of its own legal system.\n\n247.\n\nMoreover, whatever the legal characterization of the application-authorization combination might be, in the circumstances of the case, the revocation of the authorization commits the State\u2019s liability under other no less fundamental principles of Indonesian law, and under provisions of same embodying the latter.\n\ni) It has been shown above (para. 85 ff.) that even if the application-authorization combination cannot be, strictly speaking, identified with a private law contract, it is nevertheless close to this legal feature, since it is formed by a meeting of minds and wills engendering reciprocal obligations; indeed, the difference is that where public interest is at stake, the State might alter or withdraw the authorization, not, however, without compensating the recipient of the same for the prejudice the latter suffers.\n\nAs a result, where the revocation is not justified by public interest - nor, as in the instant case, by the alleged failures of the investor on which the decision is based - it consists in a violation of obligations undertaken by the State, readily comparable to a violation of contractual obligations. Therefore, the fundamental principle of *pacta sunt servanda,* embodied in the Indonesian Civil Code by Article 1338 (contracts are the law of the parties), is to be applied; the consequence of said application is that the State\u2019s liability is committed in this respect as well.\n\nii) Moreover, if the assimilation of the application-authorization combination to a contract (still under the reservation of public interest) would be rejected, it should nonetheless be admitted that by deciding that the applicant is granted rights deriving from legal and regulatory provisions, and by then withdrawing said rights without due process nor substantial justification, the State has committed a wrong, for which it is liable, according, here again, to a fundamental principle embodied in Article 1365 of the Indonesian Civil Code:\n\nPersons responsible for any act in violation of the law which results in a loss to another party are obliged to replace said loss.\n\nB. *International Law*\n----------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe principle *pacta sunt servanda* is a principle of international law.\n\ni) First, it is so because of it being a general principle of law in the meaning of Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, since it is common to all legal systems in which the institution of contract is known.\n\nIndeed, the principle is basic to this institution. As a highly competent American scholar puts it \"contract or agreement seeks to secure cooperation to achieve social purposes by the use of promises given in exchanges arrived at through bargain...\" (E. A. Farnsworth, \"The Past of Promise: An Historical Introduction to Contract\", 69 Columbia Law Review 576 at 578 (1969)). Contracts as a principle of ordering rests on the proposition that individuals and legal entities make, for their own accounts and on their own responsibility significant decisions respecting resource utilization and allocation. The form of order which a society seeks to achieve by accepting that institution of contract thus depends upon the recognition that, in principle, *pacta sunt servanda.* It follows that the binding force of contractual duties for parties to a contract or agreement is recognized in every legal order that utilizes the institution of contract.\n\nThus, for instance, the principle is embodied in civil law systems; it finds its classical expression in Article 1134 of the French Civil Code:\n\nAgreements lawfully made take place of the law for those who have made them. They cannot be revoked except by mutual consent or on grounds allowed by law.  \nThey must be performed in good faith.\n\nThe principle is no less vigorous at common law. A remarkable affirmation of it was made by Jessel, M. R., in 1875 *(Printing and Numerical Registering Co* v. *Samp* (1875) L.R. 19 Eq. 462 at 465):\n\n... if there is one thing which more than another public policy requires it is that men of full age and competent understanding shall have the utmost liberty of contracting, and that their contracts when entered into freely and voluntarily shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by Courts of Justice.\n\n(See also, for American law: *Stees* v. *Leonard,* 20 Minn. 494,503 (1874); A. Von Mehren and J. Gordley, *The Civil Law System,* 1106 (2nd ed. 1977): \"The common law treats any failure to perform a duty imposed by a contractual relationship as presumptively a breach of contract and then considers the question whether, under the circumstances, the failure to perform should be excused\"; E. A. Farnsworth, *Contracts* 647 (1982), who speaks of the general rule that duties imposed by contract are absolute\").\n\nNot referring to examples taken in all legal systems, it is nonetheless worthwhile to note that *pacta sunt servanda* is also a principle of traditional Islamic law (see, e.g.: *Saudi Arabia* v. *Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco),* 27ILR 117 (1958), at 163-4; *Texaco Overseas Petroleum (topco) and California Asiatic Oil Company* v. *the Government of Libyan Arab Republic* (53 ILR 422, 1977 Award at 164).\n\nii) The principle of *pacta sunt servanda* was stated again in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (May 23, 1969).\n\nTo be sure, the transposition of this principle to agreements between States and private enterprises is debated in contemporary doctrine. However, the Tribunal is bound to note that it was applied in leading international awards (see, e.g. the *Aramco* and *topco* awards, above mentioned: *adde: Sapphire International Oil Company* v. *National Iranian Oil Company,* 35 ILR 136, at 181 (1968) ; *Libyan American Oil Company* v. *Government of the Libyan Arab Republic,* 62 ILR 41 (1977) at 170, 190.\n\niii) Now, as already said, the relationship between the parties to the instant case, engendered by the application to invest and the approval thereof is not identical to a private law contract, however close it may be to the same.\n\nBe that as it may, it must be pointed out that the above-mentioned international awards were made in cases where the dispute concerned contracts of concession. The nature of such contracts is itself debated and it has in particular been contended that the concession resulted from a unilateral act of the State, or at least that it was an administrative contract following the pattern offered by French law. Not wishing to enter into this debate, which would not be directly relevant in the instant case, the Tribunal wishes to underscore that this state of affairs did not prevent the international arbitral tribunals from deciding that the State was bound by the obligations undertaken in concession contracts, except when allowed by law to depart from them.\n\nMoreover, even if the relationship here in dispute does not constitute, properly speaking, a concession contract, nor derives from such a contract, it remains that there is a significant resemblance between these two legal structures: indeed, when authorizing a company to invest, the State grants it rights to create and operate local economic enterprises. This a state also does by a concession contract.\n\niv) Accordingly, the basic concept which underlies *pacta sunt servanda* leads necessarily to the application, in the instant case, of the very contents of the same: the party who has undertaken obligations is bound to perform them, except for cases established by law, and this fundamental rule applies to States as well as to private entities or persons.\n\nv) Moreover, independently from *pacta sunt servanda* and its logically and morally necessary extension in the present case, another principle of international law can be considered to be the basis of the Republic\u2019s international liability: it is the principle of respect of *acquired rights* (see, e.g. PCIJ, Judgment of May 25, 1926, *German Interest in Polish Upper Silesia (Merits),* Series A, No. 7 (1926) at 22 *and 44; Aramco* Award, cited above, at 168, 205; *Starret Housing Corp* v. *Iran,* (1984), decision of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, Iranian Assets Lit. Rep. 7685 (1983) ; Award in the *Shufeldt* Claim, July 24, 1930, UN Reports of International Arbitral Awards, vols II, XXVII, at 1081, 1097).\n\nIndeed, by receiving the authorization to invest, Amco was bestowed with acquired rights (to realize the investment, to operate it with a reasonable expectation to make profit and to have the benefit of the incentives provided by law). These were transmitted to the Indonesian entity, PT Amco, created in conformity with said authorization and with Indonesian law, and then partially, upon authorization by the competent authority, to Pan American.\n\nThese acquired rights could not be withdrawn by the Republic, except by observing the legal requisites of procedural conditions established by law, and for reasons admitted by the latter. In fact, the Republic did withdraw such rights, not observing the legal requisites of procedure, and for reasons which, according to law, did not justify the said withdrawal. The principle of respect of acquired rights was thus infringed, and the Republic has committed its international liability also in this respect.\n\n249.\n\nNot to admit international liability in the circumstances of this case, would amount to disregard of the very aim of the ICSID Convention as solemnly expressed in the very first sentence of its Preamble:\n\n*The Contracting States*  \n*Considering* the need for international cooperation for economic development and the role of private international investment therein.\n\nIt is in order to take this need and role into account, by protecting host States as well as foreign investors that the Convention was concluded. To deny the host State\u2019s liability where the same infringes the obligations undertaken towards the investor-as well as to refuse, in other instances, the investor\u2019s liability where he infringes his own obligations - would move to empty the ICSID Convention of any meaning.\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s liability towards Claimants being thus established, the Tribunal will now examine the prejudice which resulted for the Claimants from the State\u2019s organs actions, and determine the amount of damages to be awarded in order to compensate said prejudice.\n\nCHAPTER III \u2014 THE PREJUDICE AND THE DAMAGES TO BE AWARDED IN COMPENSATION THEREOF\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Section I\u2014 The Prejudice to be Compensated*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal will first examine the nature and the extent of the prejudice suffered by the Claimants, and then establish the causal link between the illegal acts committed by the Respondent and said prejudice.\n\nA. *The Nature and the Extent of the Prejudice*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe events that occurred from April 1, 1980 onwards, as described in Part I, Chapter II (Facts) above deprived the Claimants of the right to operate the Hotel Kartika Plaza, granted them by the approval of Amco\u2019s Application to Invest, which referred to the Lease and Management Agreement previously concluded between Amco Asia Corporation and PT Wisma Kartika, or, as far as the taking of the hotel\u2019s possession on April 1, 1980 is concerned, of the actual exercising of said right.\n\nIn addition, the revocation of the licence deprived the Claimants from the right to possibly invest in Indonesian enterprises active in the field described in the Application (Article II, as amended: see Exh. A to the Request for Arbitration, at 7, Resp. Exh. to CM, vol. I, No. 16), and referred to in the Decision of the Minister of Public Works of July 29, 1968 (see above, paras 28 and 32).\n\n253.\n\nThus, the prejudice suffered by Claimants consisted of the loss of incorporeal, patrimonial and potentially profitable rights.\n\nThe exercise of these rights was limited in time, and there is a controversy between the parties as to the period of time for which they have been granted.\n\nClaimants contend that this period was of thirty years. (Reply to Indonesia\u2019s CM, at 119), that \"(c)learly the investment was authorized for an initial period of 30 years\". Claimants rely, in this respect, on the usual practice of the Indonesian administration, according to which investment authorizations were generally granted for thirty years (see Cl. Doc. No. 36, at 52; CM F. App. C-2), and on the fact that the duration of the Lease and Management Agreement, initially of 20 years, was extended to thirty years by the agreement of January 24, 1969 (see above, para. 52). In fact, it is to be noted that according to the Management Profit Sharing Agreement of October 6, 1978 (Cl. Doc. 15, Resp. Exh. CM No. 42), the profit sharing period was extended to September 30, 1999.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant\u2019s interpretation. It contends that the authorization having referred to the initial Lease and Management Agreement was necessarily limited to the duration of the same as agreed upon, and that its extension could not have extended the licence\u2019s duration, since no application was presented, and consequently no approval to that effect was granted. In fact, Respondent contends (see Rejoinder on the Merits, at 56-7 and footnotes) that the approval was granted for nineteen years only, since the first extension of the Lease and Management Agreement, from 19 to 20 years, although agreed upon on May 19, 1968 -that is to say prior to the granting of the authorization, which occurred on July 29, 1968 - had not been brought to the attention of the Indonesian authorities that issued the licence.\n\nMoreover, Respondent points out that according to Article 111 of the Application to Invest, at the end of the nineteenth year after the establishment of the business, all shares were to become the property of Indonesian citizens or businesses. In the amendment the reference to nineteen years was deleted.\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that in its general wording, the authorization to invest did not refer exclusively to the Kartika Plaza. In addition, as to the latter, it could be admitted that the effect of the Lease and Management Agreement\u2019s extension was to extend for the same period of time the licence to operate the Kartika Plaza, notwithstanding the lack of particular application and authorization to that effect. Indeed, the licence was not limited to the Kartika Plaza; it authorized the business that would be established to be generally active in the field of real estate, and in particular of managing and leasing buildings constructed by it. Accordingly, considering that no time-limit was expressly provided for in the licence, it may be admitted that the same had been granted for the usual duration of thirty years. It could be admitted as well that the authorization covered the extended time period of the Kartika Plaza operation, since the same was, by its very nature, an activity which was covered in the authorization\u2019s general scope.\n\n255.\n\nHowever, it is not necessary to take a definite position in this respect. Indeed, even assuming that in respect of the Kartika Plaza, the authorization was granted only for the duration of the Lease and Management Agreement as initially agreed upon, the foreign investors would have had to sell their shares to Indonesian citizens or business at the end of that period. At said date, the value of the shares would have included the profit expectations of PT Amco for the remaining period of the Lease and Management Agreement. Accordingly, the prejudice suffered by the foreign investors does correspond to the loss of the right to operate the hotel, including the loss of the remaining value of said right from the date of the shares\u2019 sale to the date of expiry of the Lease and Management Agreement.\n\nB. *The Causal Link Between the Prejudice and the Respondent\u2019s Illegal Acts*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the deprivation of the rights they had acquired by the effect of the Lease and Management Agreement and of the authorization to invest resulted from one fact and two acts, namely, taken in their chronological order:\n\n(a) their *de facto* dispossession of the hotel on April 1, 1980;\n\n(b) the revocation of the licence by the decision of July 9, 1980;\n\n(c) and the rescission of the Lease and Management Agreement by the decision of the Central Jakarta District Court of January 12, 1982, affirmed by the judgment of the Jakarta Appellate Court of November 28, 1983.\n\n257.\n\n(a) The dispossession as such did not have any legal effect: it merely created a *de facto* situation, which was the actual deprivation of PT Amco of the management and operation of the hotel, and of the daily cash flow the company received by exercising its rights.\n\nAccordingly, while it is right to say that the Claimants\u2019 deprivation of the *rights* they had acquired did not result from this *de facto* dispossession, the fact of the matter is that the actual prejudice they suffered, consisting in the deprivation of the profit they were entitled to expect by exercising said rights, commenced on April 1, 1980, and that at this date, the cause of the prejudice was the dispossession: in other words, during this very first stage, there was effectively a causal link between the dispossession and the prejudice.\n\n258.\n\nSuch causal link continued, in any event, up until July 9, 1980, the day on which the Chairman of BKPM issued the Decision of Revocation of the licence, and possibly for the supplementary period of time which the effective implementation of the same would have lasted, had not the previous dispossession already produced the effects which would have been those of the revocation.\n\nNothing in the documents presented to the Tribunal, nor in the oral evidence, allows the Tribunal to determine the possible duration of such supplementary period. But such determination is not necessary. Indeed, the fact of the matter is that the prejudice suffered by the Claimants began on April 1, 1980, that it did not cease since that time and that it will cease only at the end of the time period during which or in respect of which the Claimants were entitled to expect a profit drawn from the exercise or the transfer of their rights. In other words, there is a continuous prejudice caused by the *de facto* dispossession during a first period - and indeed, a rather short one -then, from the end of the same, by the licence\u2019s revocation.\n\nTo conclude, the *de facto* dispossession was the cause of a portion of the prejudice, and the revocation, as it will be now shown, that of another portion. Now, the State is responsible for the assistance the army and police personnel gave to the dispossession which was an illegal action, as well as for the revocation of the licence, unlawfully decided without due process and for reasons that did not justify it. Therefore, the allocation of the prejudice between the two causes is not necessary: in fact, the effects of the two causes acted successively in an uninterrupted period of time.\n\n259.\n\n(b) The second causal act was the *revocation of the licence.*\n\nIt is, in the first place, obvious that the revocation was the *sole* cause of the Claimants\u2019 deprivation of the general right to invest in the field of real estate businesses, granted them by the licence.\n\nBut in addition, the causal link between the revocation and the Claimants\u2019 deprivation of their right to operate the Kartika Plaza Hotel cannot be actually contested. Indeed, deprived by the revocation of its right to operate businesses in Indonesia, PT Amco obviously could not have continued to operate the Kartika Plaza Hotel, leaving alone the fact that this very business having been referred to in the application to which the authorization itself referred, the revocation involved it mainly, if not exclusively.\n\n260.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, no objection can be drawn against this conclusion from the fact that the previously analysed decisions of the Jakarta Courts did rescind the Lease and Management Agreement.\n\nTo be sure, such rescission would have been sufficient to deprive PT Amco of its right to operate the hotel. It is also right that the decision of the Jakarta Courts to rescind was based on several grounds (see paras 139 and 141). However, among these grounds, the revocation of the licence was obviously fundamental and self-sufficient, as it is shown by the very wording of the District Court decision in this respect (Res. Fact. App. B, Att. 23, at 20-1):\n\nConsidering that based on the 9 July BKPM Chairman\u2019s decision No. 07/VIII/ PMA/1980, Defendant\u2019s approval/recognition as a capital investment company in Indonesia was revoked;  \nConsidering that with this revocation of the business licence, Defendant is no longer permitted to operate in Indonesia;  \nConsidering further that as a result of this revocation the existence of the aforementioned agreement between Plaintiff and Defendant is in fact null and void since the bases are not permitted by law;  \nConsidering that in fact the government is not a party to this agreement, but an agreement which conflicts with the law is null and void (Article 1320 of the Civil Code).\n\nNo change was made to this finding by the Jakarta Appellate Court. On the contrary, discussing PT Amco\u2019s contention that \"the 4 June 1980 interlocutory Decree No. 279/1980 G does not satisfy civil procedural due process with regard to interlocutory decrees, because the defendant was not summoned to be heard\", the Court stated (at 6):\n\n... that BKPM Chairman issued his 9 July 1980 Decision No. 07/VII/PMA/1980 revoking PT Amco Indonesia\u2019s foreign investment permit, which until this decision remains unchanged; therefore from that time legally Appellant/ Defendant/PT Amco Indonesia may not/no longer manage said Kartika Plaza Hotel Building.\n\nMore generally, the Court stated (at 9) that:\n\n... the considerations and dicta of the first judge\u2019s decision in the main case were correct and properly according to the law and justice, and because the opinions and evaluation of the Appellate Court\u2019s Council of Judges were similar to them as well... therefore the dicta of the decision in the main case of said District Court must be upheld.\n\n261.\n\nThus, whatever the other grounds on which the rescission of the Lease and Management Agreement was based, the revocation of the licence would inescapably have led the Jakarta Courts to decide it. Indeed, the other grounds were open to discussion, while the revocation made it impossible, due to legal provisions of public policy, to keep the agreement in force. Accordingly, not only the Court decisions do not deprive the revocation of its causal role, but affirm the same.\n\nMoreover, even assuming that the other grounds would have been sufficient for the Courts to take the decision to rescind, this would mean that the revocation on one side and the other grounds on the other, would have been *equivalent causes* of Claimants\u2019 deprivation of their rights in respect of the Kartika Plaza Hotel; nothing else is needed for the revocation to be characterized as being the cause of said deprivation, and consequently of the prejudice suffered by Claimants.\n\n262.\n\n(c) The third cause of prejudice relied upon by Claimants are the *Jakarta Court decisions* themselves.\n\nNo doubt these decisions, by rescinding the Lease and Management Agreement, were one of the causes of the prejudice suffered by Claimants.\n\nHowever, as earlier stated, the Tribunal does not accept that these decisions of and by themselves can commit the State\u2019s international responsibility vis-il-vis the Claimants (see above, paras 150-1).\n\nAccordingly, the causal link between the Court decisions and the prejudice is irrelevant.\n\n263.\n\nHowever, it should be also recalled that the opinions expressed in the decisions as to the dispossession of April 1, 1980, are not *res judicata* in the present arbitral procedure (see above, para. 177); moreover, the Jakarta Courts did not express any opinion at all as to the legality of the licence's revocation, which they considered as an administrative act of which they had just to draw the consequences.\n\n*Section II - The Damages*\n--------------------------\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal will now establish the legal bases of the calculation of damages to be awarded in order to compensate the prejudice, and then proceed to said calculation.\n\nA. *Legal Bases of Calculation of Damages*\n------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThe legal bases of calculation of damages will be set up according to the principles governing the matter, where the prejudice to be compensated results from the failure of a party to a contract to fulfil its obligations under the contract.\n\nThis method is justified in the instant case, in spite of the relationship between the host State and the investor not being strictly identical to a private law contract, as earlier shown, but merely comparable to such a contract.\n\nIndeed, the difference lies in the right of the State to amend, or even to withdraw its previously granted authorization, for reasons of public interest, not being free, however, even in such a case, from the obligation to indemnify the recipient of the withdrawn authorization.\n\nIn any event, in the instant case, as the Tribunal finds that no public interest could have justified the revocation of the licence, nor the military and police assistance given to the *de facto* taking by PT Wisma Kartika of the possession of the Kartika Plaza. Accordingly, the infringement by the State (by giving assistance to the taking of the hotel) of its obligation to protect the foreign investor, and by revoking the licence, of the obligations the State undertook, when granting the application, namely to guarantee to the investor the peaceful operation of his investment for the duration of the licence amount to the equivalent of an infringement of a contractual obligation; consequently, the damages to be awarded to the injured party are governed by the principles applicable in case of failure to contractual obligations.\n\nMoreover, it could by no means be contended that if the illegal acts of the State were of delictual character, the damages to be awarded in compensation of the prejudice should be of a lower amount than damages awarded in the framework of contractual liability.\n\n266.\n\nThe principles governing damages for contractual liability hardly leave room for discussion.\n\nIn Indonesian law, like in all systems of civil law, damages are to compensate the whole prejudice, whose two classical components are the loss suffered *(damnum emergens)* and the expected profits which are lost *(lucrum cessans).*\n\nIndeed, Article 1246 of the Indonesian Civil Code (Cl. Statement of Law Docs, Doc. R) provides as follows:\n\nCost, losses and interest which a claimant may claim shall consist of, in general, losses already suffered and profit which he would otherwise enjoy, subject to the exceptions and qualifications set forth below.\n\nSuch exceptions and qualifications concern mainly the contractual limitation of liability (which is of course not met in the instant case), and the requirement of directness and foreseeability of the prejudice, which will be taken into account in the calculation of the damages (see hereunder, paras 268,269 ff.).\n\nLikewise, Article 1149 of the French Civil Code - which has been used as a model by many other civil law systems - reads as follows:\n\nThe damages due to the creditor amount in general to the loss which he has sustained and the profit of which he has been deprived, except as provided in the exceptions and qualifications below.\n\nIn this respect, the Tribunal can only adhere to the enlightening explanations presented by Professor Bernard Audit in the legal opinion he delivered to counsel for Respondent (Resp. Leg. App. vol. VIII, 2-2), at pages 6 to 10. Indeed, \"the loss sustained must be ascertainable\"; \"a future loss can be ascertained\"; \"a loss of profits constitutes a remediable loss\"; \"the loss must be foreseeable\"..\n\nThe same basic principles are met in common law. The rule of English law is that \"where a party sustains a loss by reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to be placed in the same situation with respect to damages, as if the contract had been performed\" *(Robinson* v. *Harman* (1848) 1 Exch. 850, at 855; and in particular as to loss of profits: Anson\u2019s *Law of Contract,* 25th (Centenary) ed., by A. G. Guest, Oxford 1982, at 553); in the law of the United States, the courts or arbitral tribunals attempt to put the injured party in as good a position as he would have been in if the contract had been performed (Restatement Second on Contracts, Section 344; Uniform Commercial Code, Sections 1-106 (1)).\n\n267.\n\nThus, the full compensation of prejudice, by awarding to the injured party the *damnum emergens* and *lucrum cessans* is a principle common to the main systems of municipal law, and therefore, a general principle of law which may be considered as a source of international law.\n\nMoreover, the same principle has been applied, in cases of breach of contract by a State (and in particular, in cases of breach of a concession contract which are closely comparable to an unjustified revocation of a licence to invest) by a number of authoritative international judicial decisions and awards...\n\nOne could say that the basic precedent in this respect is to be found in the decision *Chorzow Factory (Germany* v. *Poland,* 1928 PCIJ, Series A, No. 17) where the Permanent Court of International Justice stated as follows:\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act - a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals - is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it - such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.\n\nMany international awards have taken the same position, before or after the PCIJ\u2019s decision in the *Chorzow* case (see e.g.: *Lena Goldfields,* 1930, 36 Cornell LR at 51; *Shufeldt,* cited above, para. 248-v; *Sapphire,* 35 ILR 136 at 185-6 (1963); *Norwegian Shipowner\u2019s* Claims, 1 R. Int\u2019l Arb. Awards 307 (1922), at 338; *Lighthouses* Arbitration *(France* v. *Greece),* 23 ILR 299 (1956) at 300-1).\n\n268.\n\nApplying the same principles, the Tribunal will grant, in the instant case, damages calculated to fully compensate the prejudice suffered by the Claimants.\n\nBefore proceeding to this calculation, the Tribunal has to state that here again, according to principles and rules common to the main national legal systems and to international law, the damages to be awarded must cover only the *direct* and *foreseeable* prejudice. The requirement of *directness* is but a consequence of the requirement of a causal link between the failure and the prejudice; and the requirement of *forseeability* is met practically everywhere (see e.g.: for French law, Civil Code, Article 1150: \"The debtor can only be liable for the damages which were foreseen or foreseeable at the time the contract was entered into, unless the contractual obligation was not performed due to his own fundamental act\"; *cf.* Legal Opinion of Professor Audit, Resp. Leg. App., vol. VIII, Z 2, at 8; for English law; *Hadley* v. *Baxendale* (1854) 9 Exch. 341; Anson\u2019s *Law of Contract,* 25th ed., by A. G. Guest, at 555; for international law; D. P. O\u2019Connell, *International Law,* 2nd ed. vol. 2, at 117 ff., and the cases cited, footnote 24).\n\nB. *Calculation of Damages and Interest*\n----------------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nAs previously set out (see above, para. 253), the prejudice suffered by Claimants consisted of the loss of incorporeal, patrimonial and potentially profitable rights, namely: the right to operate the Kartika Plaza Hotel (and to start with, the effective exercising of this right), and more generally, the right to possibly invest in Indonesian enterprises active in the field described in the Application.\n\n270.\n\nNo evidence having been produced by Claimants as to investments in businesses other than the Kartika Plaza they planned to realize, the Tribunal will not award them damages to compensate for the loss of the general right to invest: indeed, such damages would necessarily be based on mere hypotheses, since the prejudice they would purport to compensate for would be, if not strictly speaking, unforeseeable, in any event largely speculative.\n\n271.\n\nAccordingly, the only prejudice to be taken into account for awarding damages is the loss of the right to operate the Kartika Plaza, that is to say the loss of a *going concern.* \n\nNow, while there are several methods of valuation of going concerns, the most appropriate one in the present case is to establish the *net present value* of the business, based on a reasonable projection of the foreseeable net cash flow during the period to be considered, said net cash flow being then discounted in order to take into account the assessment of the damages at the date of the prejudice, while in the normal course of events, the cash flow would have been spread on the whole period of operation of the business.\n\nIt is true that, in a number of instances, the value of the physical assets lost by the investor due to the taking of the investment is added to the discounted cash flow in order to assess the total amount of the damages. As a matter of principle, this method might raise serious problems in cases where at the end of the contractual relationship (or of the legal relationship comparable to a contractual one), the injured party would not have been entitled to keep valuable goods previously utilized for the operation of the business. Moreover, the value of physical assets thus utilized is itself essentially based on the earnings that such utilization may yield; therefore, the valuation of the net cash flow may well reflect the commercial value of the physical assets.\n\n272.\n\nIn any event, in the instant case, while having initially included in the calculation of the damages claimed the alleged value of some physical assets (see Cl. Statement of Facts and Law, at 33), Claimants eventually put forward a calculation of damages exclusively based on the alleged discount net cash flow. For its part, Respondent, while denying any award of damages, did subsidiarily rely on evidence in which the calculation of the damages Claimants could have borne is made according to the same method.\n\nAccordingly, it is this method (namely, the valuation of the net present value of the lost business, as resulting from the discounted net cash flow) that will be applied by the Tribunal in order to assess the damages to be awarded to the Claimants.\n\n273.\n\nIn addition, it is stated again that to establish the prejudice, and consequently to assess the damages, the loss suffered will be calculated on the whole duration of the Lease and Management Agreement as amended, namely thirty years, for the reasons previously stated (see above, paras 253-5).\n\nAccordingly, the net discounted cash flow value and the net present value will be calculated from April 1, 1980 to September 30, 1999 inclusive, this being the time limit of the profit sharing agreed upon by PT Amco and PT Wisma.\n\n274.\n\nTwo estimates of the future income stream were presented to the Tribunal, namely,\n\n\u2014 by the Claimants, the Pannell Kerr Forster Report of December 15, 1983 (Cl. Doc. 137),\n\n\u2014 and by Respondent, the Horwath & Horwath Report of 28 February 1984 (Resp. Exh. 240).\n\nThe Arthur Young & Co Report of April 26, 1982 (Cl. Doc. No. 28) which Claimants originally submitted was subsequently withdrawn, so that the Tribunal will ignore it; as will the Tribunal ignore the comments on this Report by Messrs Touche Ross (see Resp. Exh. vol. V, No. 113).\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Horwath & Horwath Report represents a realistic framework upon which the Tribunal can rely.\n\nIndeed, for the reasons stated in said Report (para. 2.2), \"the only data on which the estimated, maintainable income of the hotel can be reliably based is contained in the management accounts of the hotel for the fifteen months period ended 31 March 1980\". The Tribunal cannot take as a starting point of the income projection the assumption on which the Pannell Kerr Forster Report is based, namely a loan of US $3,000,000 \"to fund the renovations needed for the hotel to reach its full market potential\" (Report, at VI-I). Indeed, this assumption is speculative, since no hard evidence, except only that of an envisaged loan, has been produced to the Tribunal. While normal maintenance expenses, which are indispensable for a hotel to function, must be assumed, the Tribunal cannot base its calculations on a huge investment which is purely hypothetical.\n\nThus, the period of 1979 and the first quarter of 1980 is the most useful starting point for the Tribunal\u2019s purposes.\n\nBy the same token however, because of the special circumstances of this case, particularly the fact that PT Amco itself only managed the property, since it had retaken possession of it, for a little over one year and the Ramada influence was only starting when PT Amco lost the hotel, the Tribunal does not feel itself bound to making a strict calculation based only on 1979 and the first quarter of 1980 results. The Tribunal is of the view that certain reasonable adjustments can be made in arriving at a figure for valuation, and therefore for compensation purposes.\n\n275.\n\nThe management accounts for the hotel for 1979 are to be found in the Nemeth Bolton Report (Ci. Doc. 64, at 3) where the \"net earnings for the year ended December 31, 1979\", are referred to as being Rp. 157,137,797. This was confirmed by subsequent accounts (see Cl. Doc. 131).\n\nThis figure, rounded up to Rp. 157.2 million, is utilized by Horwath & Horwath in Appendix A of its own valuation. It should be noted that during this period, although the hotel had a capacity of 331 rooms, only 280 were available to the public (see Cl. Doc. 137, at IV-1). It should be further noted that Ramada played an insignificant role in the management of the hotel in this period and there was no management or advertising fees payable to Ramada.\n\nIn addition, this figure does not take into account any rental income from the commercial area, interest, if any, depreciation, income taxes, profit share payable to PT Wisma.\n\n276.\n\nOn the same basis (except for the inclusion of a payment of management fees of Rp. 17.8 million to Ramada) the profit for the first quarter of 1980 was Rp. 29,000,000 (see Horwath & Horwath Report, Resp. Exh. 240, Annex A).\n\n277.\n\nSome adjustments and recalculations should however be made.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal notes that in both Horwath & Horwath and Pannell Kerr Forster Reports a reserve for replacement was taken in respect of both the hotel property and the office space. The Tribunal is of the view that although the replacement reserve is indeed appropriate for the hotel furniture and fixtures, it is not appropriate for the office space, which is already covered by maintenance provisions and depreciation. Thus, the Rp. 181.2 million combined income of 1979 and the first quarter of 1980 should be adjusted upward by adding back that portion of the reserve for replacement which is based on the gross income of the commercial premises (such income being, for 1980, i.e. the first period considered, in the amount of Rp. 111.88 million; the same proportion of the total revenue is then to be applied to the subsequent periods). In addition, the Tribunal finds that in the circumstances a 3% replacement reserve is an appropriate figure. Thus on this basis, and without any other change, the Horwath & Horwath figures shall be adjusted to read as shown in the table hereunder.\n\n**Horwath & Horwath Valuation of Business**   \nMillions of Rps.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Year** | **Hotel Profit** | **Office Rental** | **Replacement Reserve (3%) on Motel Gross Revenue only** | **Depreciation** | **Net Profit before Rent** | **Net Profit after Rent** | **Tax** | **Net Profit after Tax** | **Depreciation added back** | **Net Cash Flow** | **Net Present Value** |\n| 1980 | 121.77 | 111.88 | 27.88 | 24.93 | 180.84 | 117.54 | 25.26 | 92.28 | 24.93 | 117.21 | 117.21 |\n| 1981 | 181.85 | 167.07 | 41.63 | 33.24 | 274.05 | 178.13 | 43.43 | 134.70 | 33.24 | 167.94 | 145.95 |\n| 1982 | 203.67 | 187.11 | 46.63 | 33.24 | 310.91 | 202.09 | 50.62 | 151.47 | 32.24 | 184.71 | 139.67 |\n| 1983 | 228.11 | 209.57 | 52.22 | 33.24 | 352.22 | 228.94 | 58.68 | 170.26 | 33.24 | 203.50 | 133.80 |\n| 1984 | 255.48 | 234.72 | 58.86 | 33.24 | 398.10 | 243.83 | 63.14 | 180.69 | 33.24 | 213.93 | 122.32 |\n| 1985 | 286.14 | 262.88 | 65.51 | 33.24 | 450.27 | 225.13 | 57.53 | 167.60 | 33.24 | 200.84 | 99.85 |\n| 1986 | 320.48 | 294.43 | 73.38 | 33.24 | 508.29 | 254.14 | 66.24 | 187.90 | 33.24 | 221.14 | 95.60 |\n| 1987 | 358.93 | 329.76 | 82.18 | 33.24 | 573.27 | 286.63 | 75.89 | 210.70 | 33.24 | 243.94 | 91.71 |\n| 1988 | 402.00 | 369.33 | 92.04 | 33.24 | 646.05 | 323.02 | 86.90 | 236.12 | 33.24 | 269.36 | 88.05 |\n| 1989 | 450.24 | 413.65 | 103.09 | 33.24 | 727.56 | 363.78 | 101.20 | 262.58 | 33.24 | 295.82 | 84.09 |\n| 1990 | 504.27 | 463.29 | 115.46 | 33.24 | 818.86 | 409.43 | 121.74 | 287.69 | 33.24 | 320.93 | 79.33 |\n| 1991 | 564.79 | 518.88 | 129.31 | \u2014 | 954.36 | 477.18 | 152.23 | 324.95 | \u2014 | 324.95 | 69.85 |\n| 1992 | 632.56 | 581.15 | 145.21 | \u2014 | 1,068.50 | 534.25 | 177.91 | 356.34 | \u2014 | 356.34 | 66.60 |\n| 1993 | 708.47 | 650.89 | 161.97 | \u2014 | 1, 197.39 | 598.69 | 206.91 | 391.78 | \u2014 | 391.78 | 63.68 |\n| 1994 | 793.49 | 728.99 | 101.38 | \u2014 | 1,341.10 | 670.55 | 239.24 | 431.31 |  | 431.31 | 60.96 |\n| 1995 | 888.70 | 816.47 | 206.78 | \u2014. | 1,498.39 | 749.19 | 274.63 | 474.56 | \u2014 | 474.56 | 58.32 |\n| 1996 | 995.94 | 914.45 | 227.90 | \u2014 | 1,682.40 | 841.20 | 316.04 | 525.16 | \u2014 | 525.16 | 56.12 |\n| 1997 | 1,114.79 | 1,024.10 | 255.25 | \u2014 | 1,883.64 | 941.82 | 361.31 | 580.51 | \u2014 | 580.51 | 53.94 |\n| 1998 | 1,248.56 | 1,147.09 | 205.88 | \u2014 | 2,109,77 | 1,054.88 | 412.19 | 642.69 | \u2014 | 642.69 | 51.93 |\n| 1999 | 1,048.79 | 968.55 | 240.14 | \u2014 | 1,777.20 | 888.60 | 337.37 | 551.23 | \u2014 | 551.23 | 38.73 |\n| 1,717.71 | | | | | | | | | | | |\n\n278.\n\nThe net present value figure of Rp. 1,717,710,000 includes to some extent a deduction for management fees which were paid and would have been paid to Ramada under the Ramada Service Agreements. But by the same token, the Tribunal is cognizant that by March 31/April 1, 1980, the manager selected by Ramada had only been in place for a very short period of time and that the professional management system and international reservation network capability to which the hotel was entitled under its Agreements with Ramada had not yet had an opportunity to make the impact that it is reasonably foreseeable they would have had and which PT Amco could reasonably have expected in the circumstances. In addition, as already said, the figures for 1979 and the first quarter were based on only 280 rooms out of a possible 331 in use at that time. It is also reasonably foreseeable that the unused rooms would have been brought into use by the Ramada appointed management. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to increase the net present value figure referred to above.\n\nThus, taking all the circumstances into account, the net present value of the business on April 1, 1980, will be fixed at Rp. 2,000,000,000 (Indonesian Rupiahs two billion).\n\n279.\n\nThe investment in dispute was made in foreign currency, or composed of amounts, like accrued profits and depreciation, which according to Law No. 1/1967 (Art. 19, paras 1 (a) and (d) were convertible in such currency.\n\nNow, the initial foreign investor was Amco Asia Corporation, and the Company that bought subsequently a fraction of PT Amco\u2019s shares was a Hong Kong Company. AU the amounts mentioned in the Application to Invest, and in the Lease and Management Agreement are expressed in US dollars. As to the Authorization to Invest, it refers to the Application.\n\n280.\n\nIt thus appears that the investment was made in US dollars or in currencies convertible into US dollars, and it is to be recalled that several provisions of Law No. 1/1967 purport to authorize the investor to repatriate his capital and earnings.\n\nAccordingly, in order to grant the investor full and effective compensation of the prejudice it suffered, as international law requires, the net value of the taken business as calculated per April 1, 1980, is to be converted in US dollars on the same date.\n\nThe exchange rate at said date being 1 (one) US dollar for 625 Indonesian Rupiahs, the amount of damages to be awarded to Claimants, without considering interest, is of:\n\n2,000,000,000 / 625 = US $3,200,000\n\n(Three Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars)\n\n281.\n\nIn addition, Claimants are entitled to interest on the sum thus awarded.\n\ni) As to the rate of interest, the Tribunal finds that Indonesian law is to be applied, which will keep the interest on a moderate basis. Indeed, the legal rate of interest according to Indonesian law is of six per cent (6%) per year (Regulation of 30 May 1848, still in force).\n\nii) The date for the commencement of interest is, in Indonesian law, the day where the compensation \"is claimed before the Court\" (Indonesian Civil Code, Article 1250). Truth to tell, taken into the context of the whole provision, this starting point appears to concern compensation for the delay in the implementation of \"agreements solely regarding payment of a certain sum\". However, no provision nor precedents of the Indonesian law have been brought to the attention of the Tribunal which would exclude the same starting point of the interest, where the same is awarded in addition to damages purporting to compensate the prejudice caused by the nonfulfilment of other contracts, or, as in the instant case, by the non-fulfilment of obligations deriving from a legal relationship similar to a contract.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that in international law, the starting point of interest has been generally fixed either at the date of the wrong, or at the date of the presentation of the claim to the competent international authority (see, e.g.: Ch. Rousseau, *Droit international public,* tome V, No. 239; D. P. O\u2019Connell, *International Law,* 2nd ed., vol. 2, at 1122-3, and the mentioned decisions).\n\nTaking into account these provisions and authorities, the Tribunal decides that in the instant case, interest must run from the date of the Request for Arbitration, that is to say from January 15, 1981. As far as necessary, the interest thus awarded for the period elapsed between the said date and the date of payment of the sums awarded, should be considered as part of the compensation granted to the Claimants, in order for the same to come as close as possible to the full compensation prescribed by international law.\n\n282.\n\nThe amounts thus awarded are due jointly and severally to the three Claimants. They are to be paid outside of Indonesia.\n\nCHAPTER IV \u2014 THE COUNTERCLAIM\n-----------------------------\n\n283.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial (at 81-2) Respondent presented a counterclaim seeking the payment by Claimants of all monies they should have paid as taxes and import duties, but for the tax holiday granted by the licence. In the Counter-Memorial (at 82) the value of these facilities was estimated at least US $1,000,000.\n\n284.\n\nIn their Reply to the Counter-Memorial (at 120-1), Claimants denied the counterclaim in all respects, stating that \"all the taxes and duties now claimed by Indonesia were lawfully excused\" and, moreover, that \"any claim for taxes due prior to January 1, 1978 is barred by the 5 year Indonesian statute of prescription or limitation of actions\".\n\n285.\n\nIn the Rejoinder on the Merits (at 59 ff.), Respondent stated that \"the total amount of Indonesia\u2019s counterclaim... is US $583,591,000\" (at then current average rate of US $1/Rp. 975). As to the statute of limitation, Respondent contends that the same \"begins to run only as of the date the company tax obligation is incurred\", that is to say \"the date of the licence revocation\".\n\n286.\n\nTo start with, the Tribunal finds that the statute of limitation relied upon by Claimants (namely Tax Law on Interest, Dividend and Royalty 1959, as amended and supplemented by Law No. 10 year 1970; Cl. Doc. 69, and Corporation Tax Ordinance 1925, as amended and supplemented by Law No. 8, 1970: Cl. Doc, 70) are not applicable in the instant case. Indeed, these statutes concern recovery of taxes by the Indonesian authorities, but not the obligation of an investor to pay taxes of which he was exempted, where such obligation results from the laws, regulations and decisions related to the investment.\n\n287.\n\nThis being said, the Tribunal notes that in the instant case, the revocation of the tax facilities which were attached to the licence, was decided in the BKPM Chairman\u2019s decision of July 9, 1980 (see above, paras 128-30) as a result of the revocation of the licence.\n\nAccordingly, since the Tribunal finds that the revocation of the licence was unlawful, as a consequence, the revocation of the tax facilities was unlawful as well.\n\n288.\n\nIt is true that Article 4 of Decree No. 63/1969 (Resp. Fact. App. C. Att. 3) provides that:\n\n(i)f the capital investment plan is not implemented in accordance with the approval that has been granted, this may result in the withdrawal of the business licence that has been issued and/or the withdrawal of all facilities that have been granted.\n\nAccordingly, the competent authorities could withdraw the facilities, while not withdrawing the licence itself. However, such a separate withdrawal was not decided by the Indonesian authorities in the instant case, and it is not for the Tribunal to separate the measures which were strongly linked one with the other by said authorities.\n\nMoreover, a separate revocation of the tax facilities would have been decided without the warnings prescribed by the above-cited regulations (see above, para. 193), and in the same procedural conditions as the revocation of the licence, which resulted in lack of due process.\n\nTo conclude, the counterclaim is to be rejected.\n\n289.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal wishes to stress that the contention presented by Respondent in the Rejoinder on the Merits (at 59-60), concerning the alleged \"uninvested capital\", is not submitted as a counterclaim, but as an objection to the possible implementation of the theory of unjust enrichment.\n\nNow, since the Tribunal does not find this theory relevant to the case (see above, para. 149), there is no need to discuss the Respondent\u2019s contention in this respect.\n\nCHAPTER V \u2014 COSTS\n-----------------\n\n290.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the Washington Convention provides as follows:\n\n(2) In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n291.\n\nIn the instant case, considering that both parties did their best to assist the Tribunal to perform its tasks, and considering in addition the size of the claim compared to the amount that will be awarded, the Tribunal decided that each party should bear the expenses of all kinds incurred by it in the preparation and presentation of its case, and that the arbitrators\u2019 fees and the charges for use of the facilities of the Centre are to be shared equally between the parties.\n\n[292].\n\nFor the above stated reasons,\n\nTHE TRIBUNAL DECIDES AS FOLLOWS:\n\n1. The Republic of Indonesia shall pay jointly and severally to Amco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development Limited and PT Amco Indonesia, the sum of US dollars three million two hundred thousand (US $3,200,000) with interest on this amount at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum from January 15, 1981 to the date of effective payment.\n\n2. The amounts thus awarded are due by the Respondent jointly and severally to the Claimants. They are to be paid outside of Indonesia.\n\n3. The Respondent\u2019s counterclaim is rejected.\n\n4. All other submissions of the parties are rejected.\n\n5. Each party shall bear the fees and expenses it incurred for the preparation and presentation of its case.\n\n6. Each party shall bear one half of the arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses and of the charges for use of the facilities of the Centre."}, {"Title": "Ad hoc Committee Decision on the Application for Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "1986-05-16T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Ad hoc Committee Decision on the Application for Annulment\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. THE ARBITRAL AWARD OF NOVEMBER 20, 1984 AND THE APPLICATION FOR ITS ANNULMENT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn March 18, 1985, the Republic of Indonesia (hereinafter referred to as \"Indonesia\" filed with the Secretariat of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (hereinafter referred to as \"ICSID\") an application for the annulment, under Article 52 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of March 18, 1965 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Convention\") of an arbitral Award rendered on November 20. 1984 in ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Award\"). The Arbitral Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as \"Tribunal\") which handed down the Award was formed in 1981 as a result of the filing by Amco Asia Corporation, a company incorporated in the State of Delaware, Pan American Development Limited, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong (hereinafter referred to as \"Pan American\") and PT Amco Indonesia, a company incorporated under the laws of Indonesia (hereinafter referred to as \"PT Amco\") (the three companies being hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Amco\") of a request for arbitration entered by ICSID on January 15. 1981.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal was composed of Mr Edward W. Rubin, of Canadian nationality, as arbitrator appointed by Amco; Prof. Isi Foighel, of Danish nationality, as arbitrator appointed by Indonesia and Prof. Berthold Goldman, of French nationality, as President appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID.\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal awarded damages to Amco in the amount of US S3,200,000 plus interest on the following grounds:\n\n(a) Indonesia had failed to protect PT Amco's right to manage the Kartika Plaza Hotel under a contract with PT Wisma. a private corporation organized under Indonesian law and controlled by Inkopad. a body connected with the Indonesian Army. PT Wisma had resorted to illegal self-help in its dispute with PT Amco and had taken over the management of the hotel with the help of army and police personnel on March 31/April 1, 1980. Indonesia's failure to protect PT Amco\u2019s rights in this regard was violative of a host State's duty under international law to protect foreign investors' rights and interests.\n\n(b) BPKM, Indonesia\u2019s Capital Investment Coordination Board, had on July 9, 1980 revoked PT Amco\u2019s licence to do business in Indonesia, without the prior warning required by BPKM Decree 01/1977. The failure of BPKM to give prior warning to PT Amco. and the grant of no more than one hour\u2019s hearing to PT Amco's representatives in the revocation proceedings, amounted in the view of the Tribunal to a violation of the fundamental principle of due process.\n\n(c) In its revocation order, BPKM found that:\n\n(i) PT Aeropacific rather than PT Amco had carried out PT Amco's obligation to manage the hotel under the investment licence; and\n\n(ii) PT Amco had contributed only US $1,399,000 of foreign capital of which US $1,000,000 was in the form of loan and US $399,000 in the form of equity capital, instead of the US $3,000,000 of foreign equity capital plus US $1,000,000 of loan capital promised by. and required from. PT Amco in its application for the investment licence and in the Lease and Management contract (Award, para. 129).\n\nThe Tribunal held that the above two grounds did not justify BPKM\u2019s revocation of PT Amco\u2019s investment licence, considering that:\n\n(i) Indonesia must have known and had tolerated management of the Kartika Plaza Hotel by PT Aeropacific, which management had in any case ceased two years before the revocation order;\n\n(ii) PT Amco had invested US $2,472,490 in equity capital rather than a total of US $1,399,000. of which US $1,000,000 was in loan funds and US $399,000 in equity funds, as stated by BPKM;\n\n(iii)The shortfall of 1/6 of the required investment was not material under the circumstances of the case.\n\n(d) The Tribunal awarded PT Amco damages for the illegal deprivation of its rights to manage the Kartika Plaza Hotel from April 1, 1980 until the stipulated date of expiry of the contract in 1999. The decisions reached by the Indonesian courts before whom PT Wisma had on April 24. 1980 commenced proceedings against PT Amco for rescission of the management contract on grounds of breach thereof by PT Amco. which decisions granted by PT Wisma\u2019s demand for rescission, were based on the fact that the management contract had become inoperative by reason of BPKM having revoked PT Amco's licence to do business in Indonesia. The Tribunal did not feel bound by the decision of the Indonesian courts and so awarded damages to PT Amco. The Tribunal, referring to the right to repatriate capital imported into Indonesia under Indonesia's Foreign Investment Law. held Amco entitled to receive the damages awarded to it in United States dollars and outside Indonesia.\n\n4.\n\nIndonesia seeks the annulment of the Award for the following reasons:\n\n(a) That the Arbitral Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and failed to state the reasons upon which it based the Award deciding that claimant's investment shortfall was not material and did not justify the revocation of PT Amco's licence, and that the amount of foreign equity capital invested by claimants was approximately US $2,5 million:\n\n(b) That the Arbitral Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in deciding not to consider the merits of all the grounds justifying the revocation of PT Amco's licence:\n\n(c) That the Arbitral Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and failed to state the reasons upon which it based the Award in deciding that Indonesia violated due process in revoking the investment licence and therefore must compensate claimants;\n\n(d) That the Arbitral Tribunal failed to state the reasons upon which it based the Award in deciding that Indonesia incurred State responsibility for failure to afford adequate protection to a foreign investor:\n\n(e) That the Arbitral Tribunal failed to state the reasons upon which it based the Award in deciding that Indonesia shall compensate claimants in US dollars outside Indonesia, converted from rupiahs at the exchange rate prevailing as of April 1, 1980.\n\n5.\n\nIndonesia's Application for annulment was accompanied by a request for stay of enforcement of the Award. The Application having been registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on March 27, 1985. [sic] appointed Dr Florentino P. Feliciano, of Philippine nationality, Prof. Andrea Giardina, of Italian nationality, and Prof. Ignaz Seidl-Hohenveldern. of Austrian nationality, as members of the *ad hoc* Committee, pursuant to Article 52(3) of the Convention. The *ad hoc* Committee elected Prof. Ignaz Seidl-Hohenveldern as Chairman.\n\n6.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(5) of the Convention and to Article 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General, together with the notice of registration, informed both parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award. On May 3. 1985. Amco submitted a memorandum in opposition to Indonesia\u2019s request to stay enforcement of the Award. On May 10, 1985. Indonesia filed a memorandum in support of continuing the stay of enforcement.\n\n7.\n\nIn the presence of Dr George R. Delaume, representative of\u00a0ICSID and Secretary-General of the *ad hoc* Committee and of the attorneys for the parties (Ms Carolyn B. Lamm. Dr Gillis Wetter and Mr Tupman of White & Case, Washington for Indonesia: Mr William Rand, Mr Robert M. N. Hornick and Mr Paul de Friedland of Coudert Brothers, New York for Amco), the *ad hoc* Committee held an initial meeting on May 17, 1985 in Frankfurt in order to discuss various procedural questions. This meeting gave rise to a procedural order of the same day establishing the date for the exchange of memorials and the dates for the oral proceedings, and dealing with various questions of detail.\n\n8.\n\nBy a further order also dated May 17, 1985, the *ad hoc* Committee granted to Indonesia a provisional stay of enforcement of the Award, provided Indonesia furnished an irrevocable and unconditional bank guarantee for payment of the Award or parts thereof in accordance with such final decision as the *ad hoc* Committee might reach. The bank guarantee, with terms of provisions approved by the Chairman of the *ad hoc* Committee, was issued on July 3, 1985.\n\n9.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee met in Rome on September 7 and 8. 1985. By an order of September 7, 1985, the *ad hoc* Committee confirmed its understanding of the terms of the bank guarantee and confirmed the stay of enforcement until the issuance of its decision on the Application for annulment.\n\n10.\n\nIn accordance with the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s order of May 17, 1985. and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Memorial of Indonesia was filed on 15 October 1985; the Reply of Indonesia was filed November 1, 1985; the Reply of Indonesia was filed on November 1, 1985; and the Rejoinder of Amco on November 15. 1985. In its Memorial of August 30. 1985. Indonesia, while maintaining that the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction constituted an excess of power, withdrew that ground for annulment initially submitted in its Application for annulment \"so that the Committee might focus on other issues bearing directly on Indonesia\u2019s liability for payment\" (Memorial, p. 32).\n\n11.\n\nHearings on oral argument were held in Vienna on January 8. 9 and 10. 1986. in the presence of Prof. Gautama for Indonesia and Mr Tan for Amco. The members of the *ad hoc* Committee continued their deliberations on January 11-13. 1986. The complete files and transcripts of the proceedings before the Tribunal were at the disposal of the *ad hoc* Committee during the Vienna hearings. The *ad hoc* Committee requested the parties on January 13, 1986 to indicate where in these records and transcripts appear documents and statements bearing on certain arguments pleaded before the *ad hoc* Committee. The parties complied with this request.\n\n12.\n\nAfter the Vienna hearings, the Chairman asked\u00a0ICSID to furnish to the members of the *ad hoc* Committee copies of certain documents from the files of the Tribunal, ICSID complied with these requests.\n\n13.\n\nThe transcripts of the Vienna hearings were completed on February 19, 1986. and circulated to the members of the *ad hoc* Committee and to the respective counsel for the parties.\n\n14.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee met for a working session in Paris on April 1-5. 1986. having at its disposal the complete files and transcripts of the proceedings before the Tribunal. The *ad hoc* Committee met for a final working session in Vienna on May 12-15, 1986.\n\n15.\n\nOn May 12. 1986. the Chairman of the Committee asked ICSID to advise the parties that the proceedings were closed.\n\nII. THE LAW GOVERNING THE ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee has been instituted to determine whether the Award, or any part thereof, should be annulled on one or more of the grounds for annulment established in Article 52(1) of the Convention. In its Application for annulment. Indonesia invokes one or more of three grounds \u2014 \"that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers\" (Art. 52(1)(b)); \"that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" (Art. 52(1)(d)); and \"that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based\" (Art. 52(1)(e)) \u2014 in respect of several findings and conclusions of the Tribunal. The *ad hoc* Committee will deal with the various claims of nullity raised by Indonesia following the general sequence of the findings and conclusions adopted by the Tribunal in its Award, instead of grouping the specific claim under each of the three grounds for annulment set forth in the Convention. In carrying out its task, the *ad hoc* Committee will seek to \"deal with every question submitted\" to it by the parties (Art. 48(3), Convention; *\"repondre a tous les chefs de conclusion\"* (in the French text); *\"todas las pretensiones\"* (in the Spanish text), (cf. *infra* para. 34)) every question, that is. which reasonably relates to the principal issues before it. In view of the provisions of Article 52(4) of the Convention the *ad hoc* Committee believes that Article 48(3) of the Convention is as applicable to the annulment proceedings before it as to the original proceedings before the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the *ad hoc* Committee has to consider certain general questions raised by the parties which bear directly upon the main features of annulment proceedings and the evaluation of asserted grounds of nullity under the Convention.\n\n1. *The law to be applied by the* ad hoc *Committee*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe first general question which the *ad hoc* Committee must deal with preliminarily, refers to the law governing the annulment proceedings and to the law governing the resolution of the dispute among the parties.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee, having been established under the provisions of an international instrument \u2014 i.e., the Convention \u2014 believes that the proceedings before it are governed by the relevant Articles of the Convention and by the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules) adopted by the Administrative Council of ICSID. Problems of interpretation or lacunae which emerge have to be solved or filled in accordance with the principles and rules of treaty interpretation generally recognized in international law.\n\n19.\n\nAs to the law applicable in respect of the substance of the dispute before it. the *ad hoc* Committee considers Article 42 of the Convention controlling, in exactly the same way that the Tribunal regarded the same Article decisive of the law governing the substantive dispute before it. Since the parties had not agreed on some other law governing their relations, the Tribunal (Award, para. 148) declared that it would apply to the dispute the law of Indonesia and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n20.\n\nIt seems to the *ad hoc* Committee worth noting that Article 42(1) of the Convention authorizes an ICSID tribunal to apply rules of international law only to fill up lacunae in the applicable domestic law and to ensure precedence to international law norms where the rules of the applicable domestic law are in collision with such norms.\n\n21.\n\nThe above view of the role or relationship of international law norms vis-a-vis the law of the host State, in the context of Article 42(1) of the Convention, is suggested by an overall evaluation of the system established by the Convention. The law of the host State is. in principle, the law to be applied in resolving the dispute. At the same time, applicable norms of international law must be complied with since every ICSID award has to be recognized, and pecuniary obligations imposed by such award enforced, by every Contracting State of the Convention (Art. 54(1), Convention). Moreover, the national State of the investor is precluded from exercising its normal right of diplomatic protection during the pendency of the ICSID proceedings and even after such proceedings, in respect of a Contracting State which complies with the ICSID award (Art. 27. Convention). The thrust of Article 54(1) and of Article 27 of the Convention makes sense only under the supposition that the award involved is not violative of applicable principles and rules of international law.\n\n22.\n\nThe above view on the supplemental and corrective role of international law in relation to the law of the host State as substantive applicable law. is shared in ICSID case law (Decision of May 3. 1985 of an\u00a0ICSID *ad hoc* Committee 1 Foreign Investment Law Journal p. 89 (1986). annulling the Award of October 21. 1983, in *Klockner* v. *Republic of Cameroon,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2. Clunet 1984 p. 409). hereinafter referred to as *\"Klockner ad hoc* Committee Decision\", para. 69) and in literature (e.g. Broches, \"The Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States\", *Recueil des Cours* vol. 136 (1972. II) p. 392). and finds support as well in the drafting history of the Convention (see*ICSID Convention, Analysis of Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention,* vol. II/l, p. 804 (Washington, D.C. 1970); hereinafter referred to as *\"History\").*\n\n23.\n\nThe law applied by the Tribunal will be examined by the *ad hoc* Committee, not for the purpose of scrutinizing whether the Tribunal committed errors in the interpretation of the requirements of applicable law or in the ascertainment or evaluation of the relevant facts to which such law has been applied. Such scrutiny is properly the task of a court of appeals, which the *ad hoc* Committee is not. The *ad hoc* Committee will limit itself to determining whether the Tribunal did in fact apply the law it was bound to apply to the dispute. Failure to apply such law. as distinguished from mere misconstruction of that law. would constitute a manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal and a ground for nullity under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention. The *ad hoc* Committee has approached this task with caution, distinguishing failure to apply the applicable law as a ground for annulment and misinterpretation of the applicable law as a ground for appeal.\n\n24.\n\nThe Tribunal recognized (Award, para. 147) that the parties had not authorized it to decide the case *ex aequo et bono* which the parties could have done (Art. 42(3). Convention). Amco (Rejoinder, p. 32) submits that this explicit recognition by the Tribunal created an \"overwhelming\" presumption, albeit a rebuttable one. that the arbitrators did indeed refrain from deciding *ex aequo et bono* any issue raised by the parties. The *ad hoc* Committee, however, has not been pointed to. and has been unable to discover, any legal principle or rule justifying acceptance of such a general presumption. Accordingly, the *ad hoc* Committee has had to examine closely both what the Tribunal said it was doing and what it was in fact doing, in resolving particular questions.\n\n25.\n\nAt the same time, the *ad hoc* Committee does not believe that the Tribunal had necessarily to preface each finding or conclusion with a specification of the Indonesian or international law rule on which such finding or conclusion rests. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions or findings must of course be read in their context (*cf*. *infra* para. 40).\n\n26.\n\nNeither does the *ad hoc* Committee consider that any mention of \"equitable consideration\" in the Award necessarily amounts to a decision *ex aequo et bono* and a manifest excess of power on the part of the Tribunal. Equitable considerations may indeed form part of the law to be applied by the Tribunal, whether that be the law of Indonesia or international law. The parties discussed this issue before the *ad hoc* Committee in respect of both Indonesian law and international law. Postponing discussion of this item in relation to Indonesian law until examination of the issue of lawfulness of the revocation of PT Amco\u2019s investment licence *(infra* para. 104). the *ad hoc* Committee will consider it here in relation to international law.\n\n27.\n\nIndonesia asserts that the International Court of Justice has applied equitable considerations, or rather \"equitable principles\" *(cf.* ICJ Reports. 1969. p. 48). only in the context of delimitation of maritime boundaries and that application of such considerations should remain restricted to such context (Reply, p. 18). It appears to the *ad hoc* Committee, however, that when the International Court of Justice looked into whether a claim for compensation was \"reasonable\" in the *Corfu Channel* case (ICJ Cases. 1949. p. 249). the Court was in effect taking account of equitable considerations in a context not involving maritime boundaries delimitation. The Court did much the same thing in its Judgment on the Merits in the *Barcelona Traction* Case (ICJ Cases. 1970. p. 48. para. 92) and dealt directly with this problem in its Advisory Opinion of October 23. 1956 on *Judgments of the Administrative Tribunal of the ILO upon complaints made against the UNESCO.* (ICJ Reports. 1956. p. 100). The view that a tribunal applying international law may take account of equitable considerations in non-maritime boundaries cases, is fairly widely shared among scholars in international law (See. e.g.. Verdross-Simma. *Universelles Volkerrecht.* p. 422 (3rd ed., 1984); Rosenne. \"Equitable Principles and the Compulsory Jurisdiction of International Tribunals\", in *Festschrift fiir Rudolf Bindschedler.* p. 410 (1980); Pirotte. *\"La Notion d\u2019Equite dans la Jurisprudence Recente de la CIJ\",* 77 RGDIP p. 131 (1973); and W. Friedmann. \"The North Sea Continental Shelf Case: a Critique\", 64 AJIL 234-235 (1970)).\n\n28.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee thus believes that invocation of equitable considerations is not properly regarded as automatically equivalent to a decision *ex aequo et bono* which, in view of the determination of the law applicable to the present case *(supra* para. 24). would constitute a decision annullable for manifest excess of powers. Nullity would be a proper result only where the Tribunal decided an issue *ex aequo et bono* in lieu of applying the applicable law.\n\n2. *Annulment proceedings and proceedings for completion or correction of an award*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe second preliminary general question which the *ad hoc* Committee needs to address refers to the relationship between the annulment proceedings provided for in Article 52 of the Convention and the proceedings contemplated in Article 52 of the Convention and the proceedings contemplated in Article 49(2) concerning the completion and correction of an award by the same ICSID arbitral tribunal which pronounced it.\n\n30.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee has before it an Indonesian claim of nullity relating to an alleged failure on the part of the Tribunal to answer all the questions submitted to it. in disregard of the requirement of Article 48(3) of the Convention that \"the award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based\". The specific claim of Indonesia here is that the Tribunal had wrongfully refused to consider some grounds which could have led it to conclude that the revocation by BPKM of the PT Amco licence to do business in Indonesia was lawful, which grounds, however, had not been set forth in the BPKM order of revocation. In the view of Indonesia, this refusal by the Tribunal constituted a denial of equal treatment to the parties and hence a serious procedural defect and a ground for annulment of the Award (Art. 52(1)(e), Convention).\n\n31.\n\nUpon the other hand. Amco (Counter-Memorial, p. 35) states that failure of the Tribunal to decide some of the questions submitted to it. is not. in itself, a ground for annulment but rather simply entitles a party to request from the Tribunal the completion or correction of the Award under Article 49(2) of the Convention. Article 49(2) provides that a Tribunal may. upon the request of a party made within 45 days from the date of rendition of the award, render its supplementary decision which becomes part of the original award.\n\n32.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee believes that the obligation set out in Article 48(3) of the Convention to \"deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal and [to] state the reasons upon which [the award] is based\", can find its sanction in Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention. Failure to deal with one or more questions raised by the parties would entail annulment of the award where such omission amounts to \"failure to state reasons upon which [the award] is based\" (Art. 52(1)(e), Convention). Such an omission could, moreover, amount in particular situations to \"a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" (Art. 52(1)(d)) and to a manifest excess of power (Art. 52(1)(b)).\n\n33.\n\nTo support its above view. Amco (Counter-Memorial, p. 35) draws on the drafting history of the Convention and points in particular to the fact that a motion for insertion of a clause providing that failure to comply with the duty to state reasons could be a ground for annulment was rejected by a majority vote *(History.* II/1, p. 849; Amco Exh. 4). It seems worth noting, however, that, at the time such vote was cast, the present Article 52(1)(e) had already been approved and adopted (History. I. p. 210 and 230). Votes against the above motion cannot therefore necessarily be regarded as importing an objection to the content of the clause proposed, since the delegates voting against the motion may simply have found it redundant in view of the prior adoption of Article 52(1)(e).\n\n34.\n\nMoreover. Article 49(2) of the Convention must be considered in its entirety. After authorizing a Tribunal to \"decide any question which it had omitted to decided in the award\". Article 49(2) goes on immediately to direct the Tribunal to \"rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award\". Article 49(2) thus appears to offer a remedy merely for unintentional omissions to decide \"any question\" *(\"question\"* in the French text and not *\"chef de conclusion\", \"puntos\"* in the Spanish text and not *\"pretensiones\". cf. supra* para. 16). It may be sagely assumed that arbitrators will strive in their award to express clearly at least the main reasons on which the award rests. Any omissions of relatively minor points may be repaired pursuant to Article 49(2) by simply inserting the Tribunal's conclusions thereof in the award, the main reasoning of the award remaining unaffected by such insertion. This evaluation of Article 49(2) as being limited in scope is approved by Pirrung. *Die Schiedsgerichtsbarkeit nach dem Weltbankubereinkommen fur Investitionsstreitigkeiten.* p. 176 (Berlin. 1972).\n\n35.\n\nIn the present case, however. Indonesia alleges that the Tribunal had disregarded facts and arguments which, had they been considered, could have obliged the Tribunal to abandon the very bases of its Award. If the Tribunal had accepted as valid any of the arguments invoked in the Application for annulment, their insertion in the Award would have contradicted what had hitherto been the main lines of reasoning of the Award. Thus, the Tribunal would have been obliged to modify the rationale of the Award. However, the full or partial annihilation of the reasoning and conclusion of an award is the very task which the Convention allots to an *ad hoc* Committee created pursuant to Article 52(3) of the Convention, and not to the Tribunal which had rendered the Award.\n\n36.\n\nIt follows that the remedy provided by Article 49(2) would be inadequate to cope with the allegations set out in the Application before the present *ad hoc* Committee. Further, in line with the international law rule that a claimant does not need to exhaust inadequate remedies before resorting to remedies believed to be more efficient, (Finland/Great Britain. *Finnish Shipowners claim* (1924) RIAA III. 1499. at 1503-4; *cf.* Brownlie, *Principles of Public International Law* (1979). p. 498 and Jimenez de Arechaga, \"International Law in the Past Third of a Century\". *Recueil des Cours* 159 (1978 I) p. 294) Indonesia can have recourse to Article 52(1) without having previously requested the Tribunal, under Article 49(2). to decide the questions which, according to Indonesia, it had omitted to decide in the Award. This conclusion of the *ad hoc* Committee finds support in Note B to Arbitration Rule 50 prepared by the ICSID Secretariat, and according to which an application for annulment under Arbitration Rule 50 must be made separately from a request for supplementary decisions and rectifications under Arbitration Rule 49.\n\n37.\n\nFor the above reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee affirms its jurisdiction to decide the claim of Indonesia that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure when it refused to consider other grounds for revocation of PT Amco's investment licence, different from those adopted in the BPKM order. (On the substance of this claim *cf infra* paras 121-124).\n\n3. *Failure of an award to state the reasons on which it is based*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe third preliminary issue upon which the parties present opposing positions and implications to the *ad hoc* Committee relates to the duty of an ICSID tribunal to state in its award the reasons upon which it is based (Art. 48(3)) and consequently to the meaning of failure to state the reasons on which the award is based as a ground for annulment (Art. 52(1)(e)). Indonesia urges that the mere presence or inclusion in the Award of a statement of reasons would be insufficient to avoid annulment if that statement is not reasonably capable of justifying the result reached by the Tribunal (Memorial, p. 24). The view taken by Amco. on the other hand, is that failure to state reasons as a ground for nullity requires no more than references to a simple test of whether or not a statement of reasons is in fact set forth in the Award and does not refer to the quality of the reasoning adduced. To annul an award for inadequate reasoning would, in Amco's view, amount to reviewing the award on appeal, which is not the task given to an *ad hoc* Committee by Article 52 of the Convention. (CounterMemorial. pp. 37-8).\n\n39.\n\nIt has been claimed that the reasoning of an award would be incomplete if a reader of the award would not be able to find there all the reasons which prompted the arbitrators to reach their conclusions and which led to the findings in the operative part of the award (Broches. in *History* II/1 p. 515). The *ad hoc* Committee would, however, note that the International Court of Justice in its Advisory Opinion in the *Fasla* case (ICJ Reports 1973, p. 210. para. 95) rejected as too rigorous the claim that a tribunal should enter meticulously into every claim and contention by each side, or else see its award annulled.\n\n40.\n\nAn arbitral award addresses itself first and foremost to the parties before a tribunal. The parties thus are the readers to which the statements by an arbitral tribunal are presented in the first place. In the ICSID system, by refusing their consent to the publication of the award *(cf.* Art. 48. para. 5) the parties may even prevent the emergence of other readers. The parties moreover, may be expected to understand the award in its context. Uncontradicted pleadings and uncontested references to cases and authorities will enable them to fill what outside readers might deem to constitute lacunae in the reasoning of the award.\n\n41.\n\nPrior to the decision of the *Klockner ad hoc* Committee *(supra* para. 22). the most useful discussion of the problem of lack or insufficiency of the supporting reasoning of an international arbitral award was to be found in the judgment of the International Court of Justice, and in the pleadings submitted to it. in the case of the Arbitral Award made by the King of Spain on December 23. 1906 *(Honduras* v. *Nicaragua.* ICJ Reports 1960. p. 192; Pleadings vol. II. p. 71. 346 and 469).\n\n42.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee in the *Klockner* case read the duty of a tribunal to state reasons imposed by Article 48(3) and Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention as a duty to give \"sufficiently pertinent reasons\" for its award. The *Klockner ad hoc* Committee referred expressly to the solution offered by the International Court of Justice in its judgment concerning the Award by the King of Spain (ICJ Reports 1960. p. 216) in refusing to annul that Award on the\u2019ground of lack or inadequacy of supporting reasons. The Court had found that that Award dealt \"in logical order and in some detail with all relevant consideration\" and contained \"ample reasoning and explanations in support of the conclusions arrived at by the arbitrator\". The *Klockner ad hoc* Committee read this conclusion of the International Court of Justice in the context of the debate between Professor Guggenheim denying that insufficiency of motives should be a cause for annulment (Pleadings, vol. II. p. 71) and Professor Rolin urging that any award must contain a \"motivation suffisante\" *(ibid.,* p. 469) and \"pertinente\" (ibid., p. 346). The *Klockner ad hoc* Committee understood the conclusion of the International Court of Justice as an acceptance of Professor Rolin's plea *(Klockner ad hoc* Committee Decision, paras. 61 and 120).\n\n43.\n\nThis *ad hoc* Committee finds the above reading of the *Klockner ad hoc* Committee convincing. If it be true that a full control and review of the reasoning followed by an ICSID tribunal would transform an annulment proceeding into an ordinary appeal, it is also true that supporting reasons must be more than a matter of nomenclature and must constitute an appropriate foundation for the conclusions reached through such reasons. Stated a little differently, there must be a reasonable connection between the bases invoked by a tribunal and the conclusions reached by it. The phrase \"sufficiently pertinent reasons\" appears to this *ad hoc* Committee to be a simple and useful clarification of the term \"reasons\" used in the Convention.\n\n44.\n\nNeither the decision of the International Court of Justice in the case of the Award of the King of Spain nor the Decision of the *Klockner ad hoc* Committee are binding on this *ad hoc* Committee. The absence, however, of a rule of *stare decisis* in the\u00a0ICSID arbitration system does not prevent this *ad hoc* Committee from sharing the interpretation given to Article 52(1)(e) by the *Klockner ad hoc* Committee. This interpretation is well founded in the context of the Convention and in harmony with applicable international jurisprudence. Therefore this *ad hoc* Committee does not feel compelled to distinguish strictly between the *ratio decidendi* and *obiter dicta* in the *Klockner ad hoc* Committee decision.\n\nIII. TIME-BAR TO INDONESIA\u2019S ANNULMENT CLAIMS\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1. *The plea of time-bar: general considerations*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nAmco contends that the five pleas advanced by Indonesia for the annulment of the Award or parts thereof are time-barred (CounterMemorial. pp. 48-9). Amco invokes Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c) which provides that an Application for annulment shall \"state in detail...the grounds on which [it] is founded\". The application for annulment must be made within 120 days after the date of rendition of the Award (Art. 52(2), Convention). Amco claims that the pleas involved were raised by Indonesia only in the latter's memorial of August 30. 1985. more than 120 days after rendition by the Tribunal of its Award on November 20, 1984, and consequently are time-barred.\n\n46.\n\nIt appears to the *ad hoc* Committee that Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c) is not adequately complied with by an Application for annulment which merely recites *verbatim* the specific subparagraph(s) of Article 52(1) of the Convention being invoked by the applicant. The thrust of Arbitration Rule 50 is not successfully avoided by coupling a recital of the subparagraphs invoked with a general reservation of a \"right to supplement (a) presentation [of Indonesia's claims] with further written submissions\" (Indonesia's Application for Annulment, p. 8).\n\n47.\n\nThe letter of the Secretary-General of ICSID dated March 18, 1985 registering the Application for annulment does not, by itself, resolve the time-bar argument of Amco. In this letter, relied on by Indonesia (Reply p. 13), the Secretary-General stated that he had \"ascertained that the conditions for considering the request, as set forth in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and in Rule 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules were satisfied\". The registration of an Application by the Secretary-General cannot, however, be considered as conclusive in this regard upon an Arbitral Tribunal *(Holiday Inns* v. *Government of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1: Pierre Lalive. \"The First World Bank Arbitration *[Holiday Inns* v. *Morocco].* Some Legal Problems\", BYIL. 1980. p. 144. Note 2; and Parra, \"The Screening Power of the ICSID Secretary General\". News from ICSID [1985] No. 2, p. 12) nor upon an *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n48.\n\nIndonesia (Reply, p. 14) contends that Amco's time-bar argument is absurd as in effect requiring a party to file not just an application to annul but the complete memorial as well within 120 days from rendition of the Award. While the *ad hoc* Committee believes that to require a memorial within 120 days after rendition of an award need not be absurd, it does not consider Arbitration Rule 50 to have established such a requirement.\n\n49.\n\nIn the Vienna hearings (Transcript, p. 561), counsel for Indonesia opposed Amco's reading of Arbitration Rule 50(1)(c) by additionally pointing out that in its procedure and practice the International Court of Justice admits changes and additions to the submission of the parties right up to the close of the written proceedings (See Rosenne, *Procedure in the International Court,* p. 112 [1983]).\n\n50.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee does not believe there is any lacuna in the ICSID Arbitration Rules justifying recourse to the practice before the International Court as a model. It is useful to refer in this connection to Note B to Arbitration Rule 50 which states that the procedure there set out \"is roughly analogous to that for the filing and registration of an original request for arbitration in accordance with the Institution Rules\". Note K to ICSID Institution Rule 2(1)(e) states that this Institution Rule requires that the request for arbitration contain \"information concerning the issues in dispute. No evidence on this subject need be submitted at this stage; the information given can be developed by the requesting party in subsequent phases of the proceeding\". If applications for annulment are reasonably analogous to original requests for arbitration, and the *ad hoc* Committee believes they are, then the statements made in Indonesia's Application for annulment may be taken together with the development or amplification of such statements in Indonesia\u2019s Memorial.\n\n51.\n\nThe above general considerations would seem sufficient by themselves to lead to a denial of the time-bar plea of Amco. The *ad hoc* Committee, however, believes it useful to proceed to a detailed examination of the time-bar pleas of Amco, in order to verify whether the claims for annulment made by Indonesia can reasonably be considered as covered by the statements made in Indonesia's Application for annulment, which Application had been lodged in a timely manner.\n\n2. *The specific time-bar pleas of Amco*\n----------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nAccording to Amco, (Counter-Memorial, pp. 48-9), Indonesia has raised out of time the following new grounds in its Memorial:\n\n(i) that the decision holding Indonesia liable for the participation of its Armed Forces in wrongfully seizing the hotel was insufficiently reasoned;\n\n(ii) that the decision regarding Indonesia's due process violations seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure:\n\n(iii) that the calculation of the amount of foreign capital invested in the hotel was a manifest excess of power, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and was insufficiently reasoned;\n\n(iv) that the decision not to consider the merits of the alleged non-filing of investment implementation reports was a serious breach of fundamental rules of procedure and was insufficiently reasoned; and\n\n(v) that the order directing Indonesia to pay compensation outside Indonesia was insufficiently reasoned.\n\n53.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee believes that the grounds above pointed to by Amco are not really new grounds raised for the first time by Indonesia in its Memorial but were either in fact referred to in the Application or reasonably implicit in the Application. The statements in Indonesia's Memorial thus constitute developments or specifications of statements already made in the Application: (i) the action of army and police personnel is referred to in page 19 note 50 of the Application; (ii) the due process violations attributed to Indonesia are referred to in pages 14-15 of the Application; (iii) the calculation of the amount of foreign capital invested in the hotel is dealt with in pages 13-14 of the Application; (iv) although the alleged failure to file investment implementation reports is not mentioned *expressis verbis* on page 16 of the Application, it may be deemed covered by the reference to \"unauthorized\" transfers in page 16 of the Application; (v) the Application contains no reference to Indonesia's objection to the Award's requiring payment of compensation to Amco outside Indonesia. The *ad hoc* Committee accepts, however. Indonesia's statement that the order to pay compensation outside Indonesia is a \"logical corollary\" of the Award's requirement that compensation be paid in United States dollars (Factual Appendix B to Indonesia's Reply, at pp. 4-5). Indonesia did object in its Application (p. 22) to the order to pay in United States dollars. The *ad hoc* Committee accordingly denies Amco's time-bar pleas.\n\nIV. ALLEGED WAIVER BY INDONESIA OF CERTAIN ANNULMENT CLAIMS\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nAmco alleges (Counter-Memorial, p. 48) that Indonesia abandoned and therefore effectively withdrew two grounds for annulment set out in the Application (grounds E and F. pp. 18 and 21) since these grounds were not repeated in Indonesia's Memorial.\n\n55.\n\nGround E of the Application for annulment relating to an alleged two month limitation on lost profits is in fact mentioned in pages 91-2 of the Memorial, while in page 96 the Memorial objects to the order to pay compensation in United States dollars (ground F) alleging failure of the Tribunal to state reasons for such order. Although the Memorial did not reiterate the further claim raised in page 23 of the Application that the Tribunal had also thereby manifestly exceeded its powers, the *ad hoc* Committee docs not believe that such non-reiteration is adequate basis for finding waiver or withdrawal by Indonesia of this particular claim of nullity.\n\n56.\n\nIt will be noted that when Indonesia decided to withdraw its annulment claim relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Indonesia did so explicitly, leaving nothing to inference *(cf supra,* para. 10). Waiver and withdrawal of grounds for annulment appears to the *ad hoc* Committee to be so serious a matter that an intent to waive or withdraw cannot lightly be inferred from the mere non-repetition in the Memorial of particular grounds already set out in the Application.\n\nV. THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ANNULMENT CLAIMS\n----------------------------------------\n\nA. *Claims of Nullity Relating to Indonesia\u2019s Responsibility for the Acts of Army and Police Personnel on March 31/April 1, 1980*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. *Legality of the acts of army and policy personnel under Indonesian and international law*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nIndonesia claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Application, p. 19) and failed to state any reasons (Memorial, p. 96) in holding Indonesia responsible for the acts of army and police personnel in the Kartika Plaza Hotel from March 31/April 1. 1980. Indonesia challenges (Memorial, p. 79) the finding of the Tribunal that those acts of army and police personnel were violative of a special duty imposed by international law on States to protect foreign investors and their property (Award, paras. 171-172). In the view of Indonesia, the Tribunal should have applied Indonesian law and determined whether that law had established such a special duty, before undertaking to apply international law and any duties prescribed by such law.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the acts of PT Wisma involving the takeover of the management of the hotel from PT Amco amounted to illegal self-help and that army and police personnel assisted in carrying out such illegal unilateral acts (Award, para. 169). The *ad hoc* Committee reads this portion of the Award to mean that the Tribunal found the acts of PT Wisma, and therefore also the acts of the army and police personnel involved, to be illegal under Indonesian law. It is true that the Tribunal did not refer to any specific Indonesian statutory or regulatory provision nor to any Indonesian case-law, but this omission is no more decisive of non-application of Indonesian law than it is indicative of an intent on the part of the Tribunal, at that point in the Award, to apply international law. Indonesia claims (Application, p. 19) that the army and police personnel concerned, as of May 18, 1980, the date when the Central Jakarta District Court granted to PT Wisma the provisional right of management of the hotel pending final resolution of the suit brought by PT Wisma against PT Amco. \"had a duty [under Indonesia law] to assist PT Wisma as the lawful possessor of the hotel\". By making this statement Indonesia must be taken to be simultaneously conceding that the same army and police personnel had also a duty under Indonesian law to protect on March 31/April 1, 1980 PT Amco which was up to then in actual, peaceful and uncontested possession of the hotel. From this position of Indonesia's counsel (Application, p. 19), the *ad hoc* Committee feels entitled to conclude that there existed, at all times material for present purposes, under general Indonesian law, a duty to protect a person, whether national or foreigner, in actual, peaceful possession of property. In the case of Amco, this duty is reinforced by the undertaking of Indonesia in Article 21 of the Foreign investment Law (Law No. 1 of 1967: Factual Appendix C to the Counter-Memorial before the Tribunal, Attachment 1) \u201fnot to restrict the right of control and/or management of the enterprises concerned\" *(cf.* Award, para. 188. p. 78).\n\n59.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee is consequently unable to sustain Indonesia's contention that the Tribunal failed to evaluate the acts of the army and police personnel concerned under Indonesian law.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal did find that, on the basis of the evidence submitted before it, the acts of the army and police personnel were not taken on the private initiative of the individuals concerned (Award, para. 91) and these individuals had acted as organs of the State of Indonesia (Award, para. 101; *cf.* Jimenez de Arechaga. *op. cit.* at 277; Report of the International Law Commission. Yearbook of the ILC (1975. vol. II) p. 69). It has become unnecessary, however, for the *ad hoc* Committee, having reached the conclusion it has in the next preceding paragraph, to determine whether or not the Tribunal failed to state reasons in holding (Award, para. 171) that a special duty of States to protect foreign-owned property exists in public international law and that the acts of the army and police personnel involved constituted a violation of that duty and hence an \"internationally wrongful act... attributable to the Government of Indonesia\". The *ad hoc* Committee would nonetheless note that the existence or content of such a \"special duty\" is at best a controversial matter. A very considerable number of States reject that notion. United Nations General Assembly Resolution No. 3281 (\"IX) Article 2(2)(a). for instance, emphasizes that: \"No State shall be compelled to grant preferential treatment to foreign investment\". The *ad hoc* Committee would also note that the propriety of attributing the acts of the army and police personnel involved to the Republic of Indonesia was asserted or assumed in the Award (para. 172. p. 67) rather than demonstrated. Be that as it may, the *ad hoc* Committee finds it unnecessary to pass upon Indonesia's claim of nullity in this specific respect, having upheld the Tribunal's conclusion on the illegality of the acts of the army and police personnel concerned as a matter of Indonesian law.\n\n2. *Exhaustion of municipal remedies against the acts of army and police personnel*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nIndonesia denies (Memorial, p. 79) that the acts on March 31/April 1. 1980 of the army and police personnel concerned amounted to an international wrong for which Indonesia is responsible. Indonesia's international responsibility would be engaged, in its view, only if Indonesian law does offer such remedies in both nationals and foreigners and if PT Amco chose not to avail itself of those remedies, such abstention should not work prejudice upon Indonesia.\n\n62.\n\nIndonesia further argues (Memorial, pp. 80 and 82) that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by holding that Amco could bring its claim for compensation of damages based on the acts of the army and police personnel involved directly to an ICSID Tribunal without previously seeking redress before the Indonesian courts in conformity with the general international law rule on exhaustion of local remedies. In the allegation of Indonesia, the Tribunal failed to state any reasons for its disregard of this rule.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal did not in fact set out in the Award any reasons for not requiring Amco to exhaust local remedies. The *ad hoc* Committee, however, does not believe that this portion of the Award may be annulled on this account. The Tribunal being a creature of the Convention was bound to apply the Convention, including Article 26 thereof. By acceptance of ICSID jurisdiction without reserving under Article 26 of the Convention a right to require prior exhaustion of local remedies as a condition for obtaining access to an\u00a0ICSID tribunal. Indonesia must be deemed to have waived such right *(cf.* Shihata. \u201fTowards a Greater Depoliticization of Investment Disputes: The Roles of ICSID and MIGA\". 1 Foreign Investment Law Journal, p. 10 (1986)). This view seems to be shared by Professor Hartono in her book (in Indonesian) on *Some Transnational Problems of Foreign Investment in Indonesia* (1972). pp. 200-1 (an excerpt submitted to the Tribunal as Claimant's Legal Document NN on March 1, 1984). The *ad hoc* Committee cannot disregard this circumstance *(cf. supra* para. 40) in evaluating this portion of the Award which embodies a conclusion compelled by the fundamental law of all ICSID tribunals.\n\n64.\n\nThus Amco could seek redress directly from the Tribunal for the action of the army and police personnel without need of exhausting Indonesian local remedies. The Tribunal did not exceed its powers nor fail to state reasons when, applying international law, it characterized the intervention of army and police personnel on March 31/April 1, 1980 as an international wrong although Amco had not exhausted local remedies in Indonesia.\n\n65.\n\nIt is also claimed by Indonesia (Memorial, p. 92) that the Tribunal did not apply Indonesian law and gave no reasons for its finding that there existed an uninterrupted causal link between the illegality of the acts of army and police personnel concerned and the revocation of the licence by BPKM (Award, para. 258). The Indonesian view is that such illegality, assuming it had initially existed, was effectively ended by the interlocutory decree of the Central Jakarta District Court dated May 28. 1980 in the action brought by PT Wisma against PT Amco authorizing PT Wisma to manage the hotel during the pendency of the proceedings (Attachment 3 to Indonesia's Factual Annex B in the Proceedings before the Tribunal).\n\n66.\n\nWhile that interlocutory order may have been sufficient for the time being to cure the illegality of the acts of the army and police personnel, the Tribunal cannot be regarded as having failed to apply Indonesian law when it found (Award, para. 258) that the illegality persisted even after issuance of the interlocutory decree. The Tribunal noted (Award, para. 135) that on July 8. 1980. the Greater Jakarta Court as Appellate Court had granted PT Amco\u2019s request for postponement of implementation of the interlocutory degree. On August 4, 1980. the Supreme Court of Indonesia reversed the ruling of the Appellate Court and reinstated the interlocutory degree of the District Court (Award, para. 135). On July 9. 1980- i.e.. one day after the Appellate Court had restrained enforcement of the interlocutory decree and almost a month before the Supreme Court reinstated the same decree - the BPKM issued its order revoking Amco's investment licence (Award, para. 128). In other words, shortly before issuance of the BPKM revocation order which the Tribunal eventually held unlawful (on this matter, sec below, para. 105). acts of the army and police personnel which had enabled PT Wisma to wrest *de facto* control of the hotel from PT Amco had in effect been regarded by the Appellate Court as once again illegal. The *ad hoc* Committee believes that the portion of the Award reaching the above conclusion cannot be annulled for manifest excess of power or for failure to state reasons.\n\n3. *The claim that the acts of the army and police personnel constitute a tort: jurisdiction*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nIn the Vienna hearings (Transcript, p. 56), counsel for Indonesia argued that the acts of the army and police personnel on March 31/April 1, 1980, if illegal under international law, constituted an international tort. A dispute over state responsibility for an international tort is, it was submitted, quite different from an investment dispute. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal conferred by Indonesia's acceptance (Exhibit 18 before the Tribunal) of ICSID arbitration in Article 9 of PT Amco's investment application of May 6, 1968 (Exh. 4 before the Tribunal) was limited to jurisdiction over foreign investment disputes. Counsel for Indonesia urged that the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers by assuming jurisdiction over the matter of legality of the acts of the army and police personnel.\n\n68.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee is unable to accept the above submission of Indonesia's counsel for it does not think of \"international tort\" and \"investment dispute\" as comprising mutually exclusive categories. The Tribunal (para. 188. at p. 78) considered the acts of the army and police personnel involved as a disregard of Indonesia's commitments to foreign investors under Article 21 of Law No. 1 of 1967. Indonesia's Foreign Investment Law. In effect, the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers when it considered the question of the legality of the acts of the army and police personnel as an integral part of the investment dispute between Amco and Indonesia. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is not successfully avoided by applying a different formal characterization to the operative facts of the dispute.\n\n69.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee believes, moreover, that Indonesia is precluded from thus challenging the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Indonesia has expressly waived (Memorial, pp. 31-2) the claims of nullity relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal which had been raised in the Application for annulment. If the present claim for nullity is correctly regarded as embraced in the Application, it has been effectively waived. If, upon the other hand, this claim of nullity is not covered by the Application, Indonesia is time-barred from presenting it for the first time at the January 1986 Vienna hearings.\n\nB. *Claims of Nullity Relating to the Procedure of Revocation of the PT Amco Licence*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal gave two bases for its ruling that BPKM had disregarded the requirements of due process in revoking the investment licence issued to PT Amco. Firstly, the Tribunal found (Award, paras 193-8) that PT Amco's licence was revoked without BPKM giving PT Amco prior \"warning\" as required by Article 13(3) of BPKM decree 01/1977. Article 13(3) provides that revocation of a licence \"shall be preceded by the warning by the Capital Investment Coordinating Board (BPKM) to the investors concerned maximally 3 (three) times with the 1 (one) month interim period respectively\". Secondly, the Tribunal found (Award, paras 199-200) that in the administrative process leading to revocation of its licence. PT Amco was given only one hour's hearing.\n\n1. *Claims concerning the absence of warning from BPKM*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nIndonesia argued before the Tribunal that a series of letters from the Bank of Indonesia (the Indonesian government agency charged with the registration of foreign investments) to PT Amco over the years repeatedly reminding the latter of the registration, or lack thereof, of the investment made or claimed to have been made by PT Amco (Exhs No. 76,79,80,83 to 86 to Indonesia's Counter-Memorial before the Tribunal) should be regarded as substantially equivalent to the warnings contemplated in BPKM decree 01/1977. The Tribunal (Award, paras 196-7), considering the authorship, dates and language of those letters refused to regard the letters by the Bank of Indonesia as substantial compliance with Article 13(3) of BPKM decree 01/1977 requiring a warning by BPKM. Whatever one may think as to the necessity or propriety of the literalness with which the Tribunal interpreted Article 13(3) of the BPKM decree 01/1977, the *ad hoc* Committee does not believe itself justified in annulling this portion of the Award for failure to apply the applicable law.\n\n72.\n\nCounsel for Indonesia (Vienna transcript, p. III) challenges the Tribunal for having thus applied an administrative regulation issued by BPKM, without the Tribunal having first measured the legality of this regulation in terms of the requirements of the applicable Indonesian law. However, the decree 01/1977 of November 3, 1977, was issued by BPKM, an administrative agency of the Republic of Indonesia by virtue of the authority granted to it by the laws of Indonesia, i.e. by Article 6 of Presidential Decree No. 54/1977 of October 3. 1977. (Factual Appendix C to the CounterMemorial before the Tribunal of December 30. 1982. Att. 1, p. 64). For this reason, the *ad hoc* Committee believes that the Tribunal did not fail to apply the applicable law when it took into consideration also this Indonesian administrative regulation.\n\n73.\n\nIt is further argued by Indonesia (Memorial, p. 74) that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable Indonesian law when it annulled or set aside the BPKM order of revocation of PT Amco's licence for failure of BPKM to observe the three warnings rule.\n\n74.\n\nActually, the Tribunal did not purport to set aside the BPKM revocation order and did not seek to order *restitutio in integrum.* The Tribunal felt that it lacked the power to suspend or cancel the effects of the BPKM revocation order (Award, para. 202). An Indonesian court could repair procedural defects in a revocation order of an administrative agency for new or further proceedings. The Tribunal believed that it had no authority to act in like manner and that it had to accept the BPKM order as a definitive and closed administrative act. The Tribunal, not forming part of the Indonesian judicial system, could only award compensation to PT Amco for damages, if any, sustained by it from the definite revocation order. The amount of such compensation was of course dependent on whether or not the revocation was justified on substantive grounds (Award, paras 191. 194 and 213; *cf. infra* para. 105).\n\n2. *Claims concerning the inadequacy of the hearing given to PT Amco*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nIn its Award (paras 199-201), the Tribunal, \"quite apart from the issue of the absence of any warning\",\u00a0held in effect that PT Amco was denied a fair and adequate hearing in the course of bkp.m\u2019s revocation procedure, a denial which the Tribunal held to be contrary \"to the general and fundamental principle of due process\".\n\n76.\n\nIt is not clear from the Award whether this second basis for the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on the illegality of the BPKM revocation order is *obiter (cf.* Award, beginning on para. 199) or not *(cf.* Award, second subpara, of para. 201). The *ad hoc* Committee therefore deems it necessary to examine the claims of Indonesia relating to this issue.\n\n77.\n\nIndonesia alleges (Memorial, p. 76) that \"the general and fundamental principle of due process\" relied upon in the Award (para. 201) has every appearance of being based on equity and not on the law prescribed to be applied by Article 42(1) of the Convention. It is maintained by counsel for Indonesia (Vienna Transcript, pp. 382-4) that Indonesian administrative law does not include any general principles or standards of due process. It may well be that the words \"due process\" do not figure in the Constitution of Indonesia. It is, however, affirmed by counsel for Indonesia that a person who regards himself aggrieved by an act of the Government or administration may seek redress in the civil courts of Indonesia under Article 1365 of the Indonesian Civil Code. Such redress will be granted, it is further affirmed, if the decision of the administrative agency involved, on a case to case basis, is found to be arbitrary or *ultra vires* or not in conformity with the concepts of substantial justice prevailing in the community.\n\n78.\n\nMoreover, according to counsel for Indonesia (Memorial, p. 75) under Indonesian law, and in the light of all the circumstances of the present case, the procedural defects, if any, in the BPKM process which culminated in the order revoking PT Amco's investment licence, were not of such a nature or gravity as to compel an Indonesian court to set aside the BPKM revocation order. The general standards which Indonesian counsel affirms are part of Indonesian administrative law and which an Indonesian court would apply in resolving a challenge to the validity of an act of an administrative agency by a private person aggrieved thereby, involve the purpose and tenor of the relevant statute[s] as well as the concepts of reasonableness, proportionality, lack of arbitrariness and conformity with community notions of substantial justice. It appears to the *ad hoc* Committee that these general standards of Indonesian law are not qualitatively different from, and seem equivalent in a functional sense to, what the Tribunal appears to have had in mind in referring to \"the general and fundamental principle of due process\". It is true that the Tribunal did not seek to define the conditions for the application of this \"general and fundamental principle\". Indonesia, in relying on certain statements contained in the decision of the *Klockner ad hoc* Committee (Memorial, p. 77). claims that this portion of the Award is therefore vitiated by insufficient motivation. Since counsel for Indonesia have conceded that the general principles or standards here involved are applied, in the context of the Indonesian judicial system, on a case-by-case basis (Vienna transcript, p. 382), the Award can scarcely be challenged for having relied on a general principle without discussing specific rules defining the scope of application of such principle.\n\n79.\n\nFor these reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee holds that this portion of the Award is not vitiated by a failure to apply the applicable law amounting to a manifest excess of power on the part of the Tribunal, nor by failure to state reasons.\n\n3. *Consequences of illegalities in the revocation procedure*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nIn this respect Indonesia claims, moreover, (Memorial, p. 74) that the Tribunal manifestly misinterpreted and misapplied Indonesian law in establishing the legal consequences to be drawn from the procedural irregularities ascertained in the revocation proceedings. In this regard, the Tribunal held (Award, para. 201) that those procedural irregularities were sufficient grounds for concluding that the BPKM revocation order was illegal according to Indonesian law, entailing the further consequence of responsibility of Indonesia for damages towards Amco.\n\n81.\n\nThe fundamental character of Indonesian administrative law seems, to the *ad hoc* Committee, to be such that a conclusion on the legality of an act of an Indonesian public authority, and on its implications for responsibility for damages, can be reached only after an overall evaluation of the act including consideration of its substantive bases.\n\n82.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee believes that the Tribunal in its finding (Award, para. 201 *in fine)* concerning the illegality of the order because of procedural defects merely intended to state that the order did not fully comply with Indonesian administrative law. This intent is clearly suggested by the fact that the Tribunal immediately found it \"necessary\" (Award, para. 202 first line) to deal with the substantive reasons of the revocation, for the assessment of the amount of damages, if any, due because of the revocation.\n\n83.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee, therefore, rejects Indonesia\u2019s claim for annulment and holds that the Tribunal, by affirming the illegality of the revocation procedure while, at the same time, conditioning the award of damages upon the existence of substantive reasons for the revocation, did not manifestly exceed its powers in interpreting and applying Indonesian law in this regard.\n\nC. *Claims of Nullity Relating to the Substantive Grounds of the Revocation Order of BPKM*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nIndonesia claims (Memorial, p. 35) that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons in finding the BPKM revocation illegal on substantive grounds as well.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the grounds set out in the BPKM order did not justify the revocation of PT Amco\u2019s investment licence. These grounds were:\n\n(i) that PT Amco had not itself managed the hotel as required in the licence but had assigned the management to other persons during the period from October 15. 1969 to June 1. 1978 without obtaining the required approval of BPKM (Award, paras 207 and 217); and\n\n(ii) that PT Amco had invested in the hotel only US $1,399,000. of which US $1 million was in the form of a loan and US $399,000 in the form of \"own capital (equity)\", while PT was obliged to invest a total of US $4 million, of which US $3 million was to consist of its own capital and US $1 million in loan funds (Award, para. 220).\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee will examine the Tribunal\u2019s rulings on those two grounds *seriatim.*\n\n1. *Assignment of management functions to Aeropacific*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nIn respect of the assignment of management functions by Amco the Tribunal concluded that, \"in principle\", the \"total transfer by the investor of the actual performance of his obligations towards the host State. without the latter\u2019s consent, amounts to a material failure of the investor's obligations, which might justify the revocation of the licence\" (Award, para. 216). The Tribunal also found, however (Award, para. 217). that PT Amco had entered into two \"sub-lease\" agreements by which, with the consent of PT Wisma, the management of the hotel had been transferred (first to Pulitzer-KLM-Garuda and later to PT Aeropacific) for nine years (from 1969 to 1978). To the Tribunal, it was \"hardly credible that the Government was not informed about the two sublease agreements\". The Government, having failed to impose sanctions from 1969 to 1978 and also from 1978 until the dispute broke out in 1980, could not in 1980 base its revocation order on those agreements. In the view of the Tribunal, the failure of PT Amco to carry out personally its obligation of management ceased to be material, and indeed had ceased altogether (PT Amco having resumed the management) at the time of the revocation (Award, paras 218 and 219). The *ad hoc* Committee is aware, just as the Tribunal was aware (Award, paras 214 and 215) that the identity of the foreign investor is not a casual or incidental detail but rather an essential consideration of the host State's approving the investment application. Yet, the *ad hoc* Committee docs not believe that by the above ruling, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the applicable law (e.g. Presidential Decree No. 63/1969, Article 4, Factual Appendix C to the Counter-Memorial before the Tribunal attachment 3; Presidential Decree No. 54/1977, Article 6, *ibid* attachment 1 p. 64). Neither did the Tribunal fail to state sufficiently pertinent reasons for its ruling here.\n\n87.\n\nIndonesia has also maintained (Memorial, p. 77) that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by treating the parties unequally in certain respects. One of these, it is alleged (Legal Opinion by Prof. W. Michael Reisman. p. 56. Att. 2 of Opinions of Legal Experts submitted with the Memorial), relates to the above ruling by which the Tribunal effectively attributed to Indonesia the knowledge of PT Wisma of the two sublease agreements even though the Tribunal had earlier rejected Amco's argument that PTWisma was an *\"alter ego\" of* the Republic of Indonesia and had refused to attribute to the latter the former's take over of the hotel management (Award, paras 161-3). In contrast, the Tribunal refused to hold PT Amco as duly warned because the series of letters on PT Amco's continued failure to register its claimed investment emanated from Bank Indonesia rather than the BPKM directly.\n\n88.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee acknowledges that differing results were reached by the Tribunal in the two above situations. But the *ad hoc* Committee, after according due regard to the fundamental rule of equality of the parties, is unable to conclude that the Tribunal in evaluating the surrounding facts in the two situations clearly exceeded the scope of discretionary authority granted to it by Arbitration Rule 34 and must consequently refuse Indonesia's claim of nullity in this regard.\n\n2. *Shortfall in the investment required from PT Amco*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nIndonesia claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure and failed to state sufficiently pertinent reasons for its findings that: (i) PT Amco had invested US S2,472,490, and that (ii) in the circumstances of this case, the shortfall of 1/6 of the required equity investment was not sufficiently material to justify the revocation by BPKM of PT Amco's licence (Award, paras 240-1).\n\n(a) The calculation of the shortfall\n------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal undertook the task of determining the amount invested by PT Amco in the construction, outfitting and furnishing of the hotel. This task was rendered difficult by the incompleteness of the evidence submitted by Amco as well as that submitted by Indonesia. The Tribunal did not find that PT Amco\u2019s records and accounts were stolen as PT Amco had claimed (Award, para. 104) but the fact remains that PT Amco was expelled from its business premises under circumstances imposing at least the risk of loss of records. Thus, documents which in the ordinary course of business should have been in the possession of PT Amco and presented by it to the Tribunal, were submitted by Indonesia instead. At the same time, however, important documents such as those relating to the registration or the registerability of foreign exchange supposedly infused into the project were not submitted to the Tribunal by PT Amco; a reasonably prudent foreign non-resident investor may be expected in the ordinary course of business to keep copies of such documents outside the host State. The incomplete character of the evidence submitted by Indonesia - e.g.. the lack of copies of complete tax returns and financial statements by PT Wisma (a company wholly owned by Inkopad, itself controlled by the Government) and of investment reports of PT Amco - may also be noted. The relatively low capability of an administrative agency efficiently to store and monitor and enforce the submission of formally required documentation is commonly a reflection of the realities of developing countries, and not an indication of bad faith towards investors, domestic or foreign. It seems to the *ad hoc* Committee that the Tribunal was aware of all these difficulties and took them into account in distributing the burden of proof between the parties (Award, para. 236).\n\n91.\n\nThus, the *ad hoc* Committee does not consider the claim of Indonesia (Reply, p. 31) of unequal treatment of the parties in the allocation of the burden of proof as successfully established and therefore does not regard annulment as justified in this respect. The assertion that the Tribunal systematically favoured PT Amco in the evaluation of the evidence (Memorial, p. 90) is negatived by. among other things, the fact that the Tribunal did exclude significant sums (Award, paras 221-30) which, according to PT Amco. should have been considered as part of its investment and which, if so counted by the Tribunal, would have brought PT Amco's total figure above the critical level of US S3 million of equity capital.\n\n92.\n\nIn this regard, Indonesia argues (Memorial, p. 49-53) that important amounts included in the aggregate sum of US $2,472,490 found by the Tribunal to have been invested by PT Amco should have been excluded from the calculation of such investment, if the Tribunal had indeed applied Indonesian law.\n\n93.\n\nBy the end of the Vienna hearings (Transcript pp. 82. 301 *et seq.,* 330 *et seq.)* it was firmly established, in the view of the *ad hoc* Committee, firstly that according to relevant provisions of Indonesian law, only investments recognized and definitely registered as such by the competent Indonesian authority (Bank Indonesia) are investments within the meaning of the Foreign Investment Law (Law No. 1/1967). Soon after promulgation of the Foreign Investment Law, a Circular or Announcement of the Foreign Exchange Bureau of Bank Indonesia required foreign investors to submit evidence that the required amounts of foreign capital originating from outside Indonesia had in fact been invested in conformity with the provisions of the Foreign Investment Law (Announcement of the blld (Foreign Exchange Bureau. Bank Indonesia] of July 25. 1967. No. 7/Inv./BUD/67 reproduced in Government of the Republic of Indonesia (ed.): *Investment in Indonesia Today* [1968]. p. 60. Attachment 2 of Factual Appendix C to the Counter-Memorial before the Tribunal). The Announcement went on to state that Bank Indonesia \"shall determine by a written statement to the enterprise whether the [imported] goods/foreign exchange will be recognized as invested capital\" (Article III[4] ibid. also: a) \"Directives for Administering and Reporting Capital Entry in the Framework of Foreign Capital Investment. Bank Indonesia, of January 12, 1973\". Att. 6 of Factual Appendix C to the Counter-Memorial before the Tribunal; and b) \"Report on the Administration of Foreign Capital in the Framework of Law No. 1 year 1967\". of July 10, 1975. Circular Letter No. 03/PTpm/VI/ED/1971 from the Capital Investment Technical Committee. Att. 4 of Factual Appendix C to the Counter-Memorial before the Tribunal). This approval and registration requirement is a principal mechanism for implementation of Article 1 of the Foreign Investment Law which limits foreign investment eligible for the incentives provided in that law to direct investment of foreign capital \"made in accordance with or based on the provisions of this law\", dispositive of the amount of approved or qualified foreign investment made by a foreign investor in Indonesia, such as PT Amco *(cf.* Legal Opinion of Prof. Komar, in Opinions of Legal Experts submitted by Indonesia with the Memorial, pp. 11-12. 18-19).\n\n94.\n\nIt was also clearly established at the Vienna hearings that PT Amco failed to obtain definitive registration with Bank Indonesia of all the amounts claimed to have been invested by it in the hotel project. It was noted by counsel for Amco (Vienna Transcript, p. 300) that Amco in the beginning tried to validate the amounts for which it had claimed provisional registration but that Amco soon ceased its efforts in this regard. Amco suggested that Bank Indonesia had been unwilling to register the amounts provisionally claimed by Amco to have been invested. Indonesia's counsel countered (Vienna Transcript, p. 505). however, that Article 1365 of the Indonesian Civil Code provided a remedy against any arbitrary refusal of Bank Indonesia to register investment actually made by Amco in conformity with the requirements of the Foreign Investment Law and that Amco through the years never invoked that remedy but had on the contrary disregarded the series of written reminders from Bank Indonesia or. registration.\n\n95.\n\nThe evidence before the Tribunal showed that as late as 1977, Amco's investment of foreign capital duly and definitely registered with Bank Indonesia in accordance with the Foreign Investment Law, amounted to only US S983,992 (Exh. No. 83 to Indonesia\u2019s Counter-Memorial before the Tribunal). The Tribunal in determining that the investment of Amco had reached the sum of US $2,472,490 clearly failed to apply the relevant provisions of Indonesian law. The *ad hoc* Committee holds that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in this regard and is compelled to annul this finding.\n\n96.\n\nThe failure of the Tribunal to seize the critical importance of PT Amco's duty to register its claimed inward investment of foreign exchange was. in the impression of the *ad hoc* Committee, the result of the basic rule on the matter (cf. *supra* para. 93) having been obscured by the lengthy arguments and counterarguments on accounting principles and problems on. e.g.. deductible taxes, undistributed profits and depreciation. Not that such discussions were redundant; they would have been important, for instance, had the Tribunal reached a different conclusion on the issue of the investment shortfall of Amco and come to confront Amco\u2019s plea of unjust enrichment on the part of Indonesia *(cf.* Award, para. 149). The basic rule that only approved and registered foreign capital inputs are investments within the contemplation of the Foreign Investment Law was in fact presented in the briefs and hearings before the Tribunal (e.g.. Mr Usman. Washington hearing, transcript p. 1231; Indonesia's Counter-Memorial before the Tribunal, p. 53; and Factual Appendix C to the CounterMemorial before the Tribunal, p. 5). The Tribunal became preoccupied, as it were, with finding its way through the complicated procedures conceived by PT Amco for the financing of the construction of the hotel building and the operation and management of the hotel. In doing so. the Tribunal was assisted by two firms of accountants specially retained by the respective parties. The accountants' reports were reviewed by the Tribunal, but it is not clear to what extent either firm sought to apply general accounting principles or the rules administered by the Indonesian foreign investment regulatory agencies.\n\n97.\n\nIt is also necessary to note that the Tribunal in its calculation of the investment of PT Amco adopted the total sum set out in the BPKM revocation order as PT Amco's investment - i.e.. US $1,399,000 which is identical with the entry in PT Amco's unaudited balance sheet of March 30. 1978 of \"shares placed and deposited\" (Amco's Exhibit No. 64 before the Tribunal). The Tribunal apparently, however, overlooked the fact that, according to the BPKM revocation order. \"PT Amco Indonesia has only desposit (sic) its capital as much as US $1,399,000 which consisted of loan for the amount of US $1,000,000 and own capital (equity) for the sum of US $399,000\" (Award, para. 204;). If it be assumed that BPKM\u2019s finding that PT Amco's share capitalization figure of US $1,399,000 had in fact included US $1,000,000 of loan funds, was correct, then the Tribunal had effectively failed to apply Article 2 of the Foreign Investment Law which limits qualified foreign investment to investment of equity capital. The Tribunal, in any case, failed to state reasons for counting the entire US $1,399,000 as equity capital and not merely US $399,000 (assuming the BPKM was correct). If, upon the other hand, it be assumed that the BPKM finding was *not* correct and the entire US $1,399,000 had somehow become \"equity capital\", then the Tribunal had still failed to apply Article 2 of the Foreign Investment Law and to state reasons for including the following item: \"6. Unamortized balance of the US $1,000,000 ABN loan - [US $]451,329\" (Award, para. 238, p. 110) as part of the (equity) capital investment of PT Amco. Neither PT Amco who had originally incurred the US $1,000,000 loan from ABN (Award, para. 62), nor PT Aeropacific who later assumed the obligation of repaying the dollar loan to abn (Award, para. 67), pretended to have obtained authorization from any competent Indonesian public authority to consider such loan funds as equity investment of PT Amco *(cf.* Legal Opinion of Prof. Komar, p. 17 in Opinions of Legal Experts submitted by Indonesia with the Memorial). The *ad hoc* Committee acknowledges that the Tribunal was aware of the rule excluding loan funds from the foreign capital investment contemplated by the Foreign Investment Law (Award, paras 228 and 236. p. 107) and therefore concludes that the Tribunal seems-to have contradicted itself. At least, this impression is not fully disproved by the text of the Award itself (para. 236i. at p. 107).\n\n98.\n\nFor the above reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee feels obliged to consider that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in failing to apply fundamental provisions of Indonesian law and failed to state reasons for its calculation of PT Amco's investment.\n\n(b) The standard of materiality\n-------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nIndonesia challenges the Tribunal's ruling that the shortfall in Amco's investment - determined by the Tribunal to amount to 1/6 of the required level of investment - was not material and did not therefore justify the revocation of PT Amco's investment licence. In the view of Indonesia, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons for this ruling (Memorial, pp. 41-4: 45-8).\n\n100.\n\nIndonesia begins by denying the existence of a materiality rule in Indonesian administrative law while admitting that Indonesian civil or contract law contains such a rule. Indonesia continues by insisting that the Tribunal should have decided the issue of materiality of PT Amco's shortfall by referring to Indonesian administrative law (Memorial, p. 43). PT Amco, on the other hand, affirms that this issue was properly governed by Indonesian civil law (Counter-Memorial, p. 74).\n\n101.\n\nThe Tribunal did not state *expressis verbis* on whether its ruling on the non-materiality of a shortfall of 1/6 of the prescribed minimum amount rested on Indonesian administrative or civil law. The Tribunal characterized the \"application-approval relation\" between PT Amco and Indonesia as \"a *sui generis* relationship comparable to a contract\" (Award, para. 189), a relationship \"not identical to a private law contract\" but nonfulfillment of the duties of which gives rise to consequences \"substantially identical to the parallel rule concerning contracts\" *(ibid).* This characterization apparently enabled the Tribunal to apply the materiality test conceded to form part of Indonesian civil law to the BPKM revocation order, while qualifying such an order as an administrative act (Award, p. 192).\n\n102.\n\nIndonesia resists this conclusion reached by the Tribunal and maintains that the applicable standards are those of Indonesian administrative law (Reply, p. 29). The *ad hoc* Committee is not able to share the view suggested by Indonesia. It appears to the *ad hoc* Committee that the general notion of materiality is not alien to Indonesian administrative law, though that notion may bear different names in different contexts. For instance, Indonesia itself invoked the general notion that a lawful reaction to a wrong must be proportionate to the wrong itself. Thus Indonesia pleaded that BPKM's omitting the three warnings to PT Amco before revocation of the latter's licence was not an error serious enough to render the revocation order automatically illegal (Memorial, p. 74). In the same vein, Indonesia urged that PT Amco's failure to register capital investment allegedly brought in by PT Amco was not merely a failure to comply with a formalistic requirement but a matter of grave national concern to Indonesia (Memorial, pp. 59-60). Since Indonesia may thus be regarded as conceding the relevance of materiality understood as proportionality in its administrative law. whether the Tribunal applied a materiality test under Indonesian administrative or civil law is basically a moot question.\n\n103.\n\nBecause the *ad hoc* Committee has annulled the conclusions of the Tribunal on the calculation *(supra* para. 98) and on the amount of PT Amco's investment *(supra* para. 95), it follows that the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on the non-materiality of the shortfall of PT Amco\u2019s investment must also fall. Since the duly registered investment of PT Amco amounted to only US $983,992, the shortfall was US $2,016,008 or 67.20% of the requisite equity investment. Upon the hypothesis that the statements made in the BPKM revocation order (US $1,000,000 in loan funds, US $399,000 in equity funds) are correct, the shortfall would escalate to US $2,601,000 or 86.10% of the required equity capital. The *ad hoc* Committee concludes that whatever standard of statutory intent, substantial justice, materiality, reasonableness or proportionality, of civil or administrative law, of Indonesian law or international law, to be employed, the revocation order must be regarded as a reasonable and proportional, and hence lawful, response.\n\n104.\n\nWith regard to the reasons given by the Tribunal in holding a shortfall of 1/6 of the required investment not material in the circumstances of this case. Indonesia argues (Memorial, p. 47) that whether PT Amco (had it been given due warning by BPKM) would have been able to prove a higher amount of investment, was entirely a matter for conjecture. It is also contended by Indonesia *(ibid.)* that to suppose that BPKM would have been willing to permit PT Amco to make good any remaining shortfall after the time-limit for making the investment had expired, was just as speculative. While one may share Indonesia's view about the hypothetical or speculative nature of the reasons adduced by the Tribunal, the *ad hoc* Committee thinks it unnecessary to deal with those reasons, having already annulled the conclusions of the Tribunal on the amount and calculation of PT Amco's investment. It perhaps remains only to note that hypothetical reasons are not *per se* insufficient reasons *(Klockner ad hoc* Committee Decision, para. 125) and an arbitral tribunal may. in some situations, well be entitled to take account of loss of opportunites suffered by a party. Finally, Indonesia complains that the Tribunal's statement \"that the hotel was effectively built and is now a part of the travel and touristic facilities of the City of Jakarta\" (Award, para. 242) in effect evidences an excess of power. The statement of the Tribunal is clearly *obiter* and while it would be interesting to examine recourse to equitable considerations as part of the applicable law as distinguished from resort to decision *ex aequo et bono* the *ad hoc* Committee believes there is no need to do so.\n\nVI. CONSEQUENCES OF THE ANNULMENT OF THE PART OF THE AWARD RELATING TO THE ILLEGALITY OF THE REVOCATION ORDER\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. *On the grant of damages for illegal revocation of the licence*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nFor the reasons set out above (paras 95 and 103), the conclusion of the Tribunal (Award para. 241) that BPKM was not justified in revoking Amco's licence on account of the shortfall of the investment, which the Tribunal calculated without regard to the applicable law and held immaterial, has to be annulled.\n\n106.\n\nHowever, if BPKM was not unjustified in revoking the licence or, substantive grounds, then, according to the findings of the Award itself *(supra* para. 74), no compensation was due for the lack of three warning' and for other procedural defects of the revocation order. Therefore, the part of the Award granting PT Amco damages on this account was to be annulled.\n\n2. *On PT Amco's right to manage the hotel*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nAs the withdrawal of the investment licence cannot be considered unjustified, the resulting effect of such withdrawal cannot be considered unjustified either, i.e. PT Amco's inability to exercise its right to manage the Kartika Plaza Hotel as of the day of issuance of the revocation order (July 9, 1980), whatever would have been the outcome of the litigation begun by PT Wisma against PT Amco before the Jakarta Courts.\n\n3. *On the grant of damages resulting from the action by army and police personnel*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe conclusions of the *ad hoc* Committee relating to the revocation order do not affect the Tribunal's finding as to the illegality of the action by army and police personnel. The *ad hoc* Committee, therefore, does not annul this part of the Award, nor the finding that Amco is entitled to damages from Indonesia.\n\n109.\n\nThe damage caused to PT Amco by the action of army and police personnel came to an end on the day of the revocation of PT Amco's licence, i.e. on July 9, 1980. Consequently, the *ad hoc* Committee annuls the grant of damages to PT Amco in paras 280-281 of the Award for the period beyond July 9. 1980.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal calculated the damages due to PT Amco on \"present value\" terms (Award, para. 271) and on the basis of a \"continuous prejudice\" (Award, para. 258). arising from the existence of a single causal link between the several heads of damage. The *ad hoc* Committee not being a Court of Appeal, is not entitled to separate those links to determine the amount of damages due for the action by army and police personnel from April 1 to July 9, 1980. For these reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee has to annul the Tribunal's findings on the amount of damages as a whole.\n\n111.\n\nThis conclusion of the *ad hoc* Committee renders academic Indonesia's claim (Application p. 21) that the Award should be annulled for having manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply Indonesian law, as determined by the decisions of Central Jakarta District Court of January 12, 1982 (Factual Appendix B of December 30, 1982. Att. 23 before the Tribunal) and of the Jakarta Appellate Court of November 28. 1983 (Exh. 257. submitted to the Tribunal) cancelling the contract between PT Wisma and PT Amco.\n\n112.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee notes, however, that the Tribunal held these decisions ill-founded, as they were based on the revocation order, held illegal by the Tribunal (Award, para. 261).\n\n113.\n\nCounsel for Indonesia claims moreover (Vienna transcript, p. 478) that the Tribunal did not apply Indonesian law when it considered these decisions ill-founded in spite of the fact that they adduced other grounds *(cf. infra* para. 121 ss) as \"equivalent causes\" for PT Amco being deprived of its right to manage the hotel (Award, para. 261).\n\n114.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee finds that this claim does not constitute an independent basis for annulment in the view of the *obiter* character of these findings in the Award.\n\n115.\n\nIn view of the fact that the revocation of Amco's licence could not be considered illegal *(cf. supra* para. 105) the *ad hoc* Committee need not evaluate Indonesia's submission (Exh. 1 to Indonesia's Memorial) of the decision of the Indonesian Supreme Court of April 30, 1985, which decision approves the rescission of the management contract exclusively on grounds other than those adduced in the revocation order. The *ad hoc* Committee cannot, in any case, annul the Award on account of an interpretation and application of the governing law offered by a court decision rendered after the date of the Award.\n\n4. *On the denial of Indonesia's counterclaim*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe conclusion of the Tribunal (Award, para. 287) rejecting Indonesia's counterclaim for recovery of tax and import facilities granted to PT Amco has to be annulled. As the *ad hoc* Committee has annulled the findings of the Award that the revocation of the licence was unlawful, the part of the Award dismissing the counterclaim for recovery of the tax and import facilities has to be annulled as well. The Tribunal (Award, para. 287) itself established an inseparable link between its conclusions on the licence revocation and on the counterclaim.\n\n5. *On the annulment of further submissions*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nIn point 4 of the operative part of the Award, the Tribunal rejected all other submissions of the parties. As this rejection was based on the consequences drawn by the Tribunal from its finding that the revocation order was illegal and as the *ad hoc* Committee has annulled this finding, point 4 of the operative part of the Award has likewise to be annulled.\n\nVII. MODALITIES OF THE PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION\n----------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nIndonesia challenges (Memorial, p. 89) the conclusions of the Tribunal on damages to be paid in US dollars outside Indonesia for failure to state reasons and as a manifest excess of powers. The *ad hoc* Committee finds that the Tribunal gave sufficiently pertinent reasons both for payment of damages in US dollars as well as for payment outside Indonesia, having based these conclusions, *inter alia* on its interpretation of the word \"repatriation\" in Article 20 of Indonesia's Foreign Investment Law (Award, para. 280). The Tribunal's amplification concerning international law on this issue appears *obiter* to the *ad hoc* Committee. Moreover, it may be recalled that Indonesia concedes - albeit in the context of the time-bar issue - that the Award's order to pay damages outside Indonesia is a \"logical corollary\" to payment in US dollars *(cf. supra* para. 53).\n\n119.\n\nFor these reasons the *ad hoc* Committee holds that, in this respect, the Tribunal, since it interpreted and applied Indonesian law, did not manifestly exceed its powers.\n\n120.\n\nIndonesia challenges (Memorial, p. 89). for failure to state reasons, the conclusion of the Tribunal (Award, para. 280) that the conversion of any amounts due as damages from rupiahs into US dollars should be made as of the date on which the damage occurred. The *ad hoc* Committee finds that the Tribunal reached that result by referring to several provisions of Law No. 1/1967 (which authorizes \"the investor to repatriate its capital and earnings\"). Moreover, the *ad hoc* Committee recalls the provisions of Article 1365 of the Indonesian Civil Code (cited in Award, para. 247) imposing upon a person causing a loss to another in violation of law a duty to \"replace\" said loss. The reference to international law made by the Tribunal appears *obiter* to the *ad hoc* Committee in this regard.\n\nVII. CONSIDERATION OF \"OTHER GROUNDS\" NOT MENTIONED IN THE REVOCATION ORDER\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal refused to consider some other grounds possibly justifying the revocation of PT Amco's licence which were not mentioned in the internal files prepared by BPKM. The most serious of these grounds related to failure by PT Amco to report to Bank Indonesia concerning the transfers abroad of large amounts of capital, non-submission of reports to BPKM concerning the realization of PT Amco's investment and alleged tax manipulations, in addition to disqualification for tax benefits to which PT Amco would have been entitled only if PT Amco had indeed completed its investment.\n\n122.\n\nIndonesia alleges (Memorial, p. 57 ss) that the Tribunal had treated Indonesia and PT Amco unequally and thus had violated a fundamental rule of procedure when it refused to consider these other grounds. According to Indonesia (Application, p. 18). while PT Amco was allowed to submit its case to the Tribunal *de novo.* i.e. adducing arguments not raised by PT Amco in the Jakarta Courts. Indonesia received unequal treatment as it was restricted to arguing its case before the Tribunal only on the grounds adduced in BPKM's revocation order.\n\n123.\n\nHere, as in other parts of the Award, the *ad hoc* Committee finds no unequal treatment of the parties. The *de novo* argument raised by Indonesia is unconvincing since the dispute in the Jakarta Courts involved PT Wisma and PT Amco. whereas the revocation order as well as the arbitration proceedings before the Tribunal concerned PT Amco and Indonesia.\n\n124.\n\nIn so far as Indonesia alleges these other grounds as hypothetical justification for the lawfulness of BPKM's revocation order, the *ad hoc* Committee believes that the Tribunal gave sufficient reasons for holding these grounds irrelevant for this purpose (Award, para. 204). Moreover, these other grounds do not figure in Indonesia's counterclaim as independent claims in addition to the recovery of tax and import facilities granted to PT Amco. In this respect, too, the *ad hoc* Committee believes that the Tribunal did not violate fundamental rules of procedure in considering these grounds irrelevant. However, the *ad hoc* Committee notes that, since the Tribunal did not find it necessary to rule on the possible additional grounds for the revocation order, there was no substantive decision of the Tribunal on these points.\n\nIX. COSTS\n---------\n\n125.\n\nIn view of the fact that both parties showed equal diligence in helping the *ad hoc* Committee to reach its conclusions, the *ad hoc* Committee finds that each of the parties should contribute in equal parts to the costs of the *ad hoc* Committee and that each party should bear its own costs for legal counsel.\n\nX. AWARD\n--------\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee by unanimous decision annuls the Award as a whole for the reasons and with the qualifications set out above. The annulment does not extend to the Tribunal's finding that the action of army and police personnel on March 31/April 1, 1980 was illegal. The annulment extends, however, to the findings on the duration of such illegality and on the amount of the indemnity due on this account. The bank guarantee issued by Indonesia on July 3, 1985 *(cf. supra* para. 8) will expire in accordance with its terms."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction in Resubmitted Proceeding", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "1988-05-10T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction in Resubmitted Proceeding\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nA. BACKGROUND\n-------------\n\n1.\n\nOn January 15, 1981 Amco Asia Corporation (\"Amco Asia\"), Pan American Development Limited (\"Pan American\") and PT Amco Indonesia (\"P.T. Amco\") filed with the Secretary General of ICSID a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Indonesia. The Tribunal established for purposes of this arbitration gave an Award on Jurisdiction on September 25, 1983. On November 21, 1984 it gave an Award on the Merits.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants had contended that whereas their investment in the building and management of a hotel complex in 1968 had been authorized by the Republic of Indonesia for a period of thirty years, in 1980 the Republic seized the investment in an armed military action and then unjustifiably cancelled the investment licence. Various decisions of the Jakarta courts later rescinded a Lease and Management Agreement relating to the hotel. The Republic of Indonesia contended that any military or police assistance was only directed to supporting the legal right of an Indonesian national to control the hotel and was not a seizure of the hotel by the government; that the cancellation of the investment licence was fully justified; and that the Jakarta courts had acted in a binding and lawful manner in rescinding the Lease and Management Agreement. In its counterclaim Indonesia asserted that, as the cancellation of the investment licence was justified due to violations of Indonesian and applicable international law, P.T. Amco was obliged to return tax and other concessions granted by Indonesia.\n\n3.\n\nA description of the claims, defences and counterclaim are to be found at paragraphs 142-146 of the Award on the Merits. The applicable law, by virtue of Article 42, paragraph 1 of the ICSID Convention was \"Indonesian law, which is the law of the state party to the dispute, and such rules of international law as the Tribunal deems to be applicable, considering the matters and issues in dispute.\" *(Award on the Merits,* para. 148).\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal found in favour of the Claimants, ordering the sum of US$3,200,000 with interest to be paid, outside of Indonesia. The Republic of Indonesia\u2019s counterclaim was rejected. Orders were also made as to fees, expenses, arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses and charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\n5.\n\nThese findings on the merits were naturally made in the form of findings on specific contentions advanced by the parties.\n\n6.\n\nOn March 18, 1985 the Republic of Indonesia filed with the Secretariat of ICSID an application under Article 52 of the Convention, for the annulment of the Award on the Merits made on November 21, 1984. An Ad Hoc Committee was established pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention, under the Chairmanship of Professor Dr. Ignaz Seidl-Hohenveldern. The Ad Hoc Committee ordered, and later confirmed, a stay of enforcement upon the furnishing by Indonesia of an irrevocable and unconditional bank guarantee.\n\n7.\n\nWritten pleadings and oral hearings ensued in 1985 and 1986. On May 16, 1986 the Ad Hoc Committee handed down its Award.\n\n8.\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee described the Award on the Merits of the Tribunal thus:\n\n\"The Tribunal awarded damages to Amco in the amount of US$3,200,000 plus interest on the following grounds:\n\n(a) Indonesia had failed to protect P.T. Amco\u2019s right to manage the Kartika Plaza Hotel under a contract with P.T. Wisma, a private corporation organized under Indonesian law and controlled by INKOPAD, a body connected with the Indonesian Army. P.T. Wisma had resorted to illegal self-help in its dispute with P.T. Amco and had taken over the management of the hotel with the help of Army and Police personnel on March 31\u2014April 1, 1980. Indonesia\u2019s failure to protect P.T. Amco\u2019s rights in this regard was violative of a host State\u2019s duty under international law to protect foreign investors\u2019 rights and interests.\n\n(b) BKPM, Indonesia\u2019s Capital Investment Coordination Board, had on July 9, 1980 revoked P.T. Amco\u2019s licence to do business in Indonesia, without the prior warning required by BKPM Decree 01/1977. The failure of BKPM to give prior warning to P.T. Amco, and the grant of no more than one hour\u2019s hearing to P.T. Amco\u2019s representatives in the revocation proceedings, amounted in the view of the Tribunal to a violation of the fundamental principle of due process.\n\n(c) In its revocation order, BKPM found that\n\n(i) P.T. Aeropacific rather than P.T. Amco had carried out P.T. Amco\u2019s obligation to manage the hotel under the investment licence; and\n\n(ii) P.T. Amco had contributed only US$1,399,000 of foreign capital of which US$1,000,000 was in the form of Ioan and US$399,000 in the form of equity capital, instead of the US$3,000,000 of foreign equity capital plus US$1,000,000 of Ioan capital promised by, and required from, P.T. Amco in its application for the investment licence and in the Lease and Management contract (Award, para. 129).\n\nThe Tribunal held that the above two grounds did not justify BKPM\u2019s revocation of P.T. Amco\u2019s investment licence, considering that:\n\n(i) Indonesia must have known and had tolerated management of the Kartika Plaza Hotel by P.T. Aeropacific, which management had in any case ceased two years before the revocation order;\n\n(ii) P.T. Amco had invested US$2,472,490 in equity capital rather than a total of US$1,399,000, of which US$1,000,000 was in loan funds and US$399,000 in equity funds, as stated by BKPM.\n\n(iii) The shortfall of 1/6 of the required investment was not material under the circumstances of the case.\n\n(d) The Tribunal awarded P.T. Amco damages for the illegal deprivation of its rights to manage the Kartika Plaza Hotel from April 1, 1980 until the stipulated date of expiry of the contract in 1999. The decisions reached by the Indonesian courts before whom P.T. Wisma had on April 24,1980 commenced proceedings against P.T. Amco for rescission of the management contract on grounds of breach thereof by P.T. Amco, which decisions granted P.T. Wi$ma\u2019s demand for rescission, were based on the fact that the management contract had become inoperative by reason of BKPM having revoked P.T. Amco\u2019s license to do business in Indonesia. The Tribunal did not feel bound by the decision of the Indonesian courts and so awarded damages to P.T. Amco. The Tribunal, referring to the right to repatriate capital imported into Indonesia under Indonesia\u2019s Foreign Investment Law, held Amco entitled to receive the damages awarded to it in United States dollars and outside Indonesia.\"\n\n*Decision,* para. 3\n\n9.\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee described the grounds on which Indonesia sought annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s Award on the Merits thus:\n\n\"Indonesia seeks the annulment of the Award for the following reasons:\n\n(a) That the Arbitral Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and failed to state the reasons upon which it based the Award in deciding that claimant\u2019s investment shortfall was not material and did not justify the revocation of P.T. Amco\u2019s license, and that the amount of foreign equity capital invested by claimants was approximately US$2,5 million;\n\n(b) That the Arbitral Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in deciding not to consider the merits of all the grounds justifying the revocation of P.T. Amco\u2019s license;\n\n(c) That the Arbitral Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and failed to state the reasons upon which it based the Award in deciding that Indonesia violated due process in revoking the investment license and therefore must compensate claimants;\n\n(d) That the Arbitral Tribunal failed to state the reasons upon which it based the Award in deciding that Indonesia incurred State responsibility for failure to afford adequate protection to a foreign investor;\n\n(e) That the Arbitral Tribunal failed-to state the reasons upon which it based the Award in deciding that Indonesia shall compensate claimants in US dollars outside Indonesia, converted from rupiahs at the exchange rate prevailing as of April 1, 1980.\"\n\n*Decision,* para. 4.\n\n10.\n\nThe Decision of the Ad Hoc Tribunal of 16 May 1986 was to annul the Award, with certain qualifications. The final paragraph of the Decision states (p. 47):\n\n\"the ad hoc Committee by unanimous decision annuls the Award as a whole for the reasons and with the qualifications set out above. The annulment does not extend to the Tribunal\u2019s findings that the action of the Army and Policy personnel on March 31-April 1, 1980 was illegal. The annulment extends, however, to the findings on the duration of such illegality and on the amount of the indemnity due on this account...\"\n\n11.\n\nAs can be seen, the dispositif refers both to annulment \"as a whole\" and \"with... qualifications.\" To understand the scope of the annulment it is therefore necessary to refer to the \"qualifications set out above\" in the Decision. The substance of the annulment claims are dealt with at pp. 21-46 of the Decision. The following pertinent findings may be noted:\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee rejected Indonesia\u2019s contention that the Tribunal failed to evaluate the acts of the Army and Police personnel concerned under Indonesian law (para. 59).\n\nThe absence of reasons for not requiring Amco to exhaust local remedies was not a ground for annulment (para. 63).\n\nThe finding of the illegality of the acts of Army and Police personnel and persistence of that illegality even after the issuance of an interlocutory decree by the District Court was not to be annulled for manifest excess of power or for failure to state reasons (para. 66 and dispositif).\n\nThe Tribunal had not manifestly exceeded its powers by assuming jurisdiction over the matter of the legality of the acts of the Army and Police personnel (para. 68).\n\nThe portion of the Award by which the Tribunal had refused to regard the letters by the Bank of Indonesia as comparable to a required warning under BKPM Decree 01/1977 was not to be annulled for failure to apply the applicable law (para. 71).\n\nThe taking into consideration by the Tribunal of an administrative regulation issued by BKPM was not a failure to apply the applicable law (para. 72). '\n\nThe holding of the Tribunal that P.T. Amco was denied a fair and adequate hearing during the revocation procedures was not annulled by any failure to apply the applicable law amounting to a manifest excess of power or to state reasons (para. 79).\n\nThe affirmation of the Tribunal of the \"illegality of the revocation procedure while, at the same time, conditioning the award of damages upon the existence of substantive reasons\" for the revocation, was not an excess of powers by the Tribunal in applying and interpreting Indonesian Law (para. 83).\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s rulings on the assignment of management functions to Aeropacific was not to be annulled for excess of powers or failure to state reasons (para. 86).\n\nIndonesia's claim for nullity based on unequal treatment of the parties in certain respects was rejected (paras. 88 and 123).\n\nIndonesia\u2019s claim for nullity based on unequal treatment of the parties in the allocation of burden of proof in the calculation of shortfall was rejected (para. 90).\n\nThe holding of the Tribunal concerning modalities of payment were not to be annulled for failure to interpret and apply Indonesian law (paras. 119 and 120).\n\n12.\n\nAll of these findings are, in the view of the present Tribunal, pertinent to an understanding of the \"qualifications set out above\" referred to in the dispositif of the Decision of the Ad Hoc Tribunal\u2014qualifications to the \"annulment as a whole.\"\n\n13.\n\nThe meaning of \"annulment as a whole\" subject to such qualifications is better understood by reference to the specific annulment findings of the Ad Hoc Tribunal, which are as follows:\n\nThe finding of the Tribunal that Amco had reached the investment sum of US$2,471,490 was a failure to apply the relevant provisions of Indonesian law and to state reasons and was annulled (paras. 95 and 98).\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s ruling on the non-materiality of the shortfall of P.T. Amco\u2019s investment is annulled as a consequence of the annulment of the conclusions of the Tribunal on the calculation and the amount of P.T. Amco\u2019s investment (para. 103).\n\nThe Tribunal's finding that BKPM was not justified in revoking Amco\u2019s licence on account of the shortfall in investment, is annulled as a consequence of the annulments in paras. 95 and 98 (para. 105).\n\nThe granting of compensation by the Tribunal for procedural defects in the revocation order was annulled (para. 106).\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee annulled the grant of damages to P.T. Amco in paras. 280\u2014281 of the Award for the period beyond July 9, 1980 (para. 109).\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s findings on the amount of damages as a whole were annulled (para. 110).\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s rejection of Indonesia\u2019s counterclaim for recovery of tax and import facilities granted to P.T. Amco was annulled (para. 116).\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding that all other submissions of the parties were rejected, is annulled (para. 117).\n\n14.\n\nIn the light of the above determinations of annulment, and the rejection of annulment in the other claims listed above, the present Tribunal issued on 21 December 1987 a Provisional Indication as to what had been annulled and what remained as *res judicata.* It provisionally indicated that the Award on the Merits of 21 November 1984 was annulled in respect of the following matters:\n\n1. the amount actually invested by P.T. Amco\n\n2. the calculation of any shortfall in respect of the required equity investment\n\n3. the materiality of any such shortfall to the revocation by BKPM of PT Amco\u2019s licence\n\n4. The finding that the withdrawal of the licence by BKPM was unlawful for substantive reasons; and legal consequences thereof\n\n5. the award of damages generally, i.e. in respect of acts of the army and police as well as claimed illegalities in respect of the licence revocation.\n\n15.\n\nIn its Provisional Indication of 21 December 1987 the present Tribunal stated that the following findings of the Tribunal in its Award on the Merits of 21 November 1984 remained *res judicata* for purposes of the present proceedings:\n\n1. the illegality of acts of the army and police\n\n2. exhaustion of municipal remedies in respect thereof\n\n3. whether such acts of the army and police constitute a tort\n\n4. unlawfulness of the revocation of the licence in respect of the procedures followed\n\n5. the inadequacy of the hearing given to P.T. Amco\n\n6. the inability of the ICSID Tribunal to set aside the revocation orders.\n\nTHE JURISDICTION OF THE PRESENT TRIBUNAL: THE IDENTIFICATION OF RES JUDICATA\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nBoth parties agreed with the Provisional Indication of what had been annulled. However, there was not total agreement on the question of *res judicata.* On January 13, 1988 Amco submitted written observations and exhibits on the *res judicata* effect of the Award on the Merits of 21 November 1984 in view of the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee on 16 May 1986. On January 14, 1988 Indonesia submitted its written observations and exhibits on these matters. Indonesia\u2019s submissions included a legal Opinion rendered by Professor W.M. Reisman.\n\n17.\n\nOn January 30 and February 1 1988 there were held hearings in London on jurisdiction, including on questions of *res judicata.*\n\n18.\n\nThe written observations of the parties and their oral argument address what we may term the principle and theory of *res judicata,* and the application of such principle and theory to specific questions arising out of the Award on Merits and the Decision on Annulment.\n\n19.\n\nThe present Tribunal also believes it helpful to deal with the general approach to *res judicata* before its application to specific issues arising in this case.\n\nB. THE GENERAL APPROACH TO RES JUDICATA\n---------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nAmco has generally taken the view that only those portions of the Award that were specifically annulled by the Tribunal are annulled; all other findings remain *res judicata* for purposes of the proceedings before the present Tribunal. Occasionally, as we shall indicate below, Amco have appeared to advance specific arguments of application that are not always fully consistent with this general position taken.\n\n21.\n\nThere is no quarrel between the parties with Professor Reisman\u2019s view that when an Ad Hoc Committee issues a qualified nullification of an award rendered by an ICSID Tribunal, a subsequent Tribunal, initiated by the claim of one or both of the original parties, must treat the unannulled parts of the award as binding on the parties and *res judicata* and hear relitigation of and decide only those parts which were nullified by the Ad Hoc Committee. (Reisman opinion, p. 5.)\n\n22.\n\nHowever, that apparently elementary proposition is at once rendered problematic, not because of any difficulty in identifying what parts of the *Award* remain unannulled, but because it is contended by Indonesia that parts of the *annulment Decision,* beyond the dispositif as to what is annulled, are binding upon the subsequent Tribunal and constitute *res judicata* along with the unannulled portions of the Award. The principle said to lead to this outcome is what we may term the principle of integrality of the annulment Decision\u2014that is to say, that certain findings of fact and law are necessarily essential to, or necessarily flow from, the annulment Decision; and that as the annulment Decision must be binding on the subsequent Tribunal, so also must be the reasons that led to it and the consequences that follow upon it.\n\n23.\n\nIndonesia, drawing on Professor Reisman\u2019s Opinion, contends that a failure to treat such integral findings as *res judicata* would be a failure to give effect to the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee and an effective nullification of parts of its findings (Reisman Opinion, pp. 5-6).\n\n24.\n\nOf course, this begs certain questions, notably, does giving effect to the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee require endorsing all of the Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s findings? And to what exactly is the subsequent Tribunal bound to give effect? In the view of Indonesia, \"in interpreting the *ad hoc* Decision, the second Tribunal must accept the interpretations of the ICSID Convention and the findings and forms of expression of the Ad Hoc Committee and interpret them in good faith.\" (Ibid., p. 6.)\n\n25.\n\nThe present Tribunal believes that there is here a certain circularity, in that if \"the Decision\" properly understood, are the decisions to annul certain points and not others, little interpretation is called for. If, however, \"the Decision\" means decisions to annul (and not annul) *and the reasoning therefore,* then rather more questions of interpretation will arise. And that depends upon whether it is indeed correct that \"the second Tribunal must accept... the findings and forms of expression of the Ad Hoc Committee.\" (Ibid., p. 6)\n\n26.\n\nThe principle of *res judicata* is a general principle of law: see David, *L\u2019Arbitrage dans le commerce international* (1982) para. 339; Cheng, *General Principles of International Law* (1953) at 336. It is a principle known both to international law and to Indonesian law. It is also generally acknowledged that (unless an instrument shall provide otherwise), nullification may be total or partial (except in the case of corruption of the arbitrator, such corruption tainting the entire award).\n\n27.\n\nSo far as the text of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention is concerned, it is stipulated that, provided the possible grounds are met \"The Committee shall have the authority to annul the award or any part thereof.. The present Tribunal does not find the slight difference of structure of the provision in the Spanish language as compared with the French and English language versions of any significance for present purposes, as there is common cause that unannulled parts of the Award are in principle *res judicata.* The problem rather is whether reasons of the Ad Hoc Committee are to be treated as *res judicata,* even if that has the effect of rendering annulled parts of the Award as effectively closed off from redetermination, notwithstanding that the normal effect of partial annulment is to place the \"parties in the legal position in which they stood before the commencement of the proceedings which gave rise to the award which has been impeached.. Common Article 4 of the 1930 Committee of Jurists, reporting to the *League Council on the proposed nullification competence of the Permanent Court, Annuaire de l\u2019Institut de Droit International, New York sess., Vol. II, p. 304, Annex 1228,* as cited by Professor Reisman.\n\n28.\n\nAfter a full fifty five pages of careful analysis and scholarly study Professor Reisman reaches the following conclusion:\n\n\"Under the ICSID Convention, an *ad hoc* Committee may annul all or part of an award. If it decides to annul only part of the award, those parts of the award which have not been annulled are *res judicata* as between the parties, in my opinion, these conclusions are mandated by the ordinary meaning, objects, and purposes of the text and the context of ICSID Article 52. They are consistent with the historical development, of which the ICSID experiment is a part, and also compelled by international policy considerations. They are consistent with more general practice. The alternative interpretation would lead to an absurdity. An interpretation which refused to give effect to the particular nullification competence of an *ad hoc* Committee would render those words in the Convention meaningless by making decisions of partial nullification, which the *ad hoc* Committee has been mandated to undertake, of no legal effect.\" (p. 56).\n\n29.\n\nThe present Tribunal agrees.\n\n30.\n\nThe problem is still to determine whether the *reasons of the nullifying body* are also *res judicata* for a subsequent Tribunal. The *Orinoco Steamship Company Case,* Hague Court Reports (1916) 226; 5 *AJIL* (1911) 20 does not address that particular question. The passage quoted by Professor Reisman at p. 60 of his Opinion (\"The general principle, announced in numerous cases is that a right, question, or fact *distinctly put in issue and distinctly determined* by a court of competent jurisdiction as a ground of recovery, cannot be disputed\") does not dispose of this question. It tells us what matters in the original Award on the merits are *res judicata* as between the parties.\n\n31.\n\nIn so far as the principle is sought to be applied to the effect of the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee upon the position of the parties before the present Tribunal, the question remains as to exactly what it is that has been \"distinctly put in issue and distinctly determined.\" The answer to that is clearly not the same, for the Ad Hoc Committee was not an appeal court, rehearing the case on its merits. Rather, what was put in issue, and determined, was whether, in reference to specified matters, the first Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state the reasons on which the Award was based,1 or seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s determination on each of these matters that was put in issue is binding.\n\nArticle 52(1)(b), 52(1)(d) and 52(1)(c). It has not been suggested that other grounds in Article 52\u2014that the Tribunal was not properly constituted or that there was corruption\u2014fall for consideration\n\n32.\n\nIt is by no means clear that the basic trend in international law is to accept reasoning, preliminary or incidental determinations as part of what constitutes *res judicata.* The finding of the *Pious Fund* Case Hague Court Reports (1916) 1, cannot be read in that way, for the Tribunal said only that \"all the parts of the judgment enlighten and mutually supplement each other and... all serve to render precise the meaning and the bearing of the dispositif (decisory part of the judgment) and to determine the points upon which there is *res judicata..* Had the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee as to what was and was not annulled (and as to what thus was and was not *judicata in the Award)* been unclear, all the points in the Decision would undoubtedly have to be relied on to interpret and clarify the dispositif. But the Decision is clear.\n\n33.\n\nIt is in the same sense that Judge Anzilotti\u2019s celebrated dictum in the *Chorzow**Factory Case* PCIJ, Series A, No. 13, p. 27 is to be understood, when he says \"it is certain that it is almost always necessary to refer to the statement of reasons to understand clearly the operative part and above all to understand the *causa petendi.\"* But he affirms at both the beginning and end of the dictum that it is the operative part of a judgment which contains the Court\u2019s binding decisions.\n\n34.\n\nWe note too the view of de Visscher, *Aspects r\u00e9cents de droit proc\u00e9dural,* 1966 at p. 179 that \"L\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ne s\u2019attache qu\u2019au dispositif de la sentence \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion des motifs.\" Professor de Visscher, while acknowledging the difficulty sometimes in distinguishing reasoning from dispositif, finds the *Chorzow Factory* Case to be authority for his opinion. See also Abi-Saab, *Les exceptions pr\u00e9liminaires dans la proc\u00e9dure de la Cour internationale,* 1967, p. 247, who believes the distinction between reasons and dispositif to be well founded in both French law and the practice of the International Court, *res judicata* applying to the latter.\n\n35.\n\nThis approach is shared by Spencer, Bowes and Turner, *Res Judicata,* 2nd ed., at para. 63, who say that when a matter is set aside by an appeal tribunal for want of jurisdiction (rather than because of a reversal on the merits), there is a decision of nullity, but not a decision \"in the sense of deciding the question of right, title, or liability in the dispute... which question is henceforth in the same position as if it had never been heard or determined at all.\"\n\n36.\n\nInterestingly, Millar, \"The Premises of the Judgment as *Res Judicata* in Continental and Anglo-American Law,\" 39 *Michigan Law Review* (1940) p. 1 at pp. 8-9 says that:\n\n\"... it is true everywhere that the rule of *res judicata* applies to the conclusion, but as regards the effect upon the premises wide differences exist between the Anglo-American law and the continental.\"\n\n37.\n\nHis survey of practice suggests that *res judicata* does not extend in the continental systems to any part of the premises. See further, Lauterpacht, *Private Law Sources,* 1927, pp. 245-247, Cheng, *General Principles of International Law,* 1953, Chapter 17, \"Res Judicata,\" pp. 350-356.\n\n38.\n\nSo far as international law practice is concerned, authors have not been able to show a clear trend towards the acceptance of reasons as *res judicata.* Thus Simpson and Fox, *International Arbitration* (1959) 259 say:\n\n\"Occasionally states have agreed to submit the question whether an arbitral award was void to a second ad hoc tribunal. In such a case, the second tribunal sits as a court of cassation rather than of appeal. *It may only uphold or quash the award, in whole or in part; it cannot substitute findings of its own.\"* (Italics added)\n\n39.\n\nThis appears from the *Orinoco Case* itself. Arbitrator Scott there states clearly that:\n\n\"[whereas] the appreciation of the facts of the case and the interpretation of the documents were within the competence of the Umpire and as his decisions, when based on such interpretation, are not subject to revision by this Tribunal, whose duty it is not to say if the case had been well or ill judged, but whether the award must be annulled.\"\n\n5 *AJIL* (1911) at 231.\n\n(In fact, the Tribunal in the *Orinoco Case* had been given express powers by the parties to substitute its own findings, and went on to do so).\n\n40.\n\nThe matter is perhaps not finally determined as a general principle of law. In any event, this Tribunal believes that at the end of the day its view on this difficult question must rest on an appreciation of its special position within the framework of ICSID.\n\n41.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention envisages the possibility of annulment, as does Article 52(6) (Professor Reisman usefully addresses in his Opinion the likely reasons and lack of significance of the absence of any reference to partial annulment in these clauses, in contrast to Article 53(3)). The Convention history clearly shows that it was decided not to allow an appeals procedure, but rather to introduce the possibility of total or partial nullity.\n\n42.\n\nCommenting on a preliminary draft of what is now Article 52(1) (see *ICSID, History of the Convention Vol. I Analysis of Documents,* p. 230), the representative of Honduras urged inclusion of \"violation or unwarranted interpretation of principles of substantive law\" as an additional ground for annulment. The Chairman responded that if the draft were to \"expand to cover serious errors in the application of substantive law, it would be tantamount to providing for an appeal, a step which thus far had not been contemplated.\" *(ICSID, History of the Convention Vol. 11 Pt. I Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation,* p. 340). No addition was made.\n\n43.\n\nThe authority given to the Ad Hoc Committee is clearly that of nullity and not of substantive revision.\n\n44.\n\nIf the present Tribunal were bound by \"integral reasoning\" of the Ad Hoc Committee, then the present Tribunal would have bestowed upon the Ad Hoc Committee the role of an appeal court. The underlying reasoning of an Ad Hoc Committee could be so extensive that the tasks of a subsequent Tribunal could be rendered mechanical, and not consistent with its authority\u2014as indicated in Article 52(6), which speaks of \"the dispute\" being submitted to a new Tribunal.\n\n45.\n\nThis will be the approach of the present Tribunal in deciding particular claims concerning *res judicata.* It is emphasised that, far from reviewing or failing to apply the Decision of the Ad Hoc Tribunal, it is an approach that is fully consonant with the formulation that the Ad Hoc Tribunal has itself chosen in indicating what is and is not nullified, and thus what is and is not *res judicata.*\n\n46.\n\nThis Tribunal fully accepts each and every determination by the Ad Hoc Committee that a finding of the first Tribunal is or is not nullified. All of these matters are *res judicata,* and this Tribunal thereby gives full effect to the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee.\n\nC. RES JUDICATA: APPLICATION TO SPECIFIC CLAIMS OF THE PARTIES\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn application of their respective approaches to *res judicata* the parties have made various specific claims as to what may and may not be relitigated before the present Tribunal.\n\n*I. Matters Sought by a Party to be Annulled by the Ad Hoc Committee, but Expressly not Annulled, or Expressly Confirmed, are Res Judicata*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThis principle is agreed by the parties and by the present Tribunal. The examples offered by Indonesia *(Observations on the Jurisdiction of the New Tribunal,* p. 33, para. 2) are also the subject of agreement: (i) the responsibility of Indonesia to compensate P.T. Amco for damages for the events of March 31-April 1, 1980; (ii) the first Tribunal\u2019s finding that the procedure of the licence revocation was unlawful; and (iii) three of the modalities of payment (currency, date of conversion, place of payment).\n\n49.\n\nThese examples should therefore be added to the list provisionally indicated by the present Tribunal on 21 December 1987 (see above, para. 14).\n\n50.\n\nWithin this category Amco has listed certain findings additional to those provisionally indicated by the Tribunal on December 1987. *The first of these* was \"The finding that the Indonesian court decisions neither interrupted nor cut off claimants\u2019 right to damages arising out of either the wrongful actions of the Army and Police or the revocation of claimants\u2019 investment license.\" *(Observations on Res Judicata,* January 13, 1988, p. 2(1)).\n\n51.\n\nBefore the Ad Hoc Committee Indonesia had contended that the Tribunal did not apply Indonesian law and gave no reasons for its finding that there existed an uninterrupted causal link between the illegality of the acts of Army and Police personnel and the revocation of the licence by BKPM. The Award on the Merits (para. 258) had found that \"such causal link continued, in any event, up until July 9, 1980, the day on which the Chairman of BKPM issued the Decision of Revocation of the license, and possibly for the supplementary period of time which the effective implementation of the same would have lasted, had not the previous dispossession already produced the effects which would have been those of the revocation.\"\n\n52.\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee found that the above conclusion of the Tribunal could not be annulled for manifest excess of power or for failure to state reasons. *(Decision,* para. 66).\n\n53.\n\nThe present Tribunal cannot accept Indonesia\u2019s view (Observations on Jurisdiction of the New Tribunal, p. 35, para. 5(ii)) that the issue of the intervening effect of the Indonesian court judgments can be relitigated. Lack of intervening effect of the interlocutory decree as upheld by the Supreme Court judgment of August 4, 1980 cannot be relitigated and is *res judicata.*\n\n54.\n\nHowever, the present Tribunal believes that it may be helpful to indicate to the parties at this juncture that it finds it has jurisdiction to deal with any intervening effect of the Supreme Court decision rendered on April 30,1985, such matter being admissible as a new fact available only after the Award was rendered.\n\n55.\n\nAlso *res judicata* is the finding of the first Tribunal that the illegality (and any attendant right to claim in respect thereof) continued uninterrupted at least until July 9th. As to any continued illegality beyond July 9th, the first Tribunal alluded to this possibility, but avoided pronouncing on it. This remains open for consideration by the present Tribunal.\n\n56.\n\nAmco has advanced a *second* contention that the finding that the Aeropacific sublease was not a valid substantive reason for revocation of the investment licence is *res judicata* (Observations on *Res Judicata,* January 13, 1988, p. 2).\n\n57.\n\nThe present Tribunal finds this to be correct. The first Tribunal found, for reasons advanced at paras. 206-219 of its Award, that the assigning of the sublease was not a sufficient ground for revocation. The Ad Hoc Committee held in clear terms that in making the above ruling the Tribunal had not failed to apply the applicable law or to state sufficiently pertinent reasons *(Decision,* para. 86).\n\n58.\n\nAmco has further contended, *thirdly* (Ibid., p. 2) that \"the finding that both sides share equally the burden of proof on how much claimants invested\" is *res judicata,* this finding having been raised before the Ad Hoc Committee, which refused to treat it as a ground of annulment. Paragraphs 90-91 of the Decision are cited by Amco in support of this contention.\n\n59.\n\nThe present Tribunal is unable to accept this view. In fact, when carefully examined, neither the first Tribunal nor the Ad Hoc Committee made the determination that \"both sides share equally the burden of proof\u2019 on how much the claimants invested. The finding of the first Tribunal was a rejection of a strict allocation of burden of proof. (See *Award,* page 108). For its part, the Ad Hoc Tribunal rejected the Indonesian claim for nullity on grounds of unequal treatment in the question of burden of proof *(Decision,* paras. 90-91). The present Tribunal finds for these reasons that there is no *res judicata* as to an equal sharing of burden of proof, and does not find it necessary to determine whether, if such a prior finding had existed, it would constitute *res judicata,* given its procedural character.\n\n60.\n\nAmco\u2019s *fourth* claim *(Observations,* p. 2) is that the finding that the principle of materiality exists in Indonesian law is *res judicata.* The present Tribunal finds that the Ad Hoc Committee accurately recites the arguments as they arose before the first Tribunal on the existence and relevance of materiality. The Ad Hoc Committee concluded that Indonesia had acknowledged the existence of materiality in Indonesian civil or contract law and \"may thus be regarded as conceding the relevance of materiality understood as proportionality in its administrative law\" *(Decision,* para. 102). In the view of the present Tribunal no issue of *res judicata* here arises, there being no determination of the legal position by the first Tribunal, and no legal finding challenged before the Ad Hoc Committee and confirmed by it.\n\n61.\n\nAmco\u2019s *fifth* claim of *res judicata (Observations on Res Judicata,* p. 2) is the finding that \"grounds not mentioned in BKPM\u2019s revocation decree cannot be used after the fact to justify the revocation.\" Indonesia, by contrast, contends that three of the substantive grounds for licence revocation, including the claim of tax fraud, have never been decided upon by the Tribunal and can therefore be relitigated *(Observations on the Jurisdiction of the New Tribunal,* p. 35).\n\n62.\n\n*The present Tribunal makes the following preliminary point:* On Indonesia\u2019s very broad approach as to what constitutes *res judicata,* it would seem that the *res judicata* effect of the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee is not only the annulment of the finding of the Tribunal that the revocation order was invalid; but also opinion offered by the Ad Hoc Committee that the revocation order was valid. If indeed the validity of the revocation Order is *res judicata,* it is hard to see how substantive grounds for the licence revocation fall to be relitigated.\n\n63.\n\nHowever, from the different starting point of the present Tribunal on *res judicata,* explained above, paras. 20-42, the issue is a real one that requires further examination.\n\n64.\n\nThis first Tribunal found it unnecessary to consider certain grounds suggested by Indonesia for revocation of the licence, not being grounds relied on in the legal act which pronounced the revocation: \"It is not for the Tribunal to build hypotheses, nor to try to guess thoughts which the authority of the revocation did not express.\" *(Award,* para. 205). The pronouncements of the Ad Hoc Tribunal clearly showed that it thought no case for annulment was made. In para. 124 of the Decision (incorrectly numbered para. 122) the Ad Hoc Committee says that the Tribunal \"gave sufficient reasons for holding these grounds irrelevant\" and goes on to say that \"the Tribunal did not find it necessary to rule on the possible additional grounds.\"\n\n65.\n\nA finding by a Tribunal that, in the circumstances before it and in the context of its own reasoning, it is unnecessary to rule on certain matters, is not *res judicata* for another Tribunal whose circumstances or reasoning may or may not be similar. Further, a decision that it is unnecessary to rule on a matter is not a finding that certain matters \"cannot be used after the fact to justify the revocation\"\u2014it is a discretion as to its preferred methods of reasoning exercised by the initial Tribunal. The present Tribunal finds that no *res judicata* exists in respect of this matter for present purposes. The absence of *res judicata* extends to all the grounds mentioned in para. 121 of the Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s Decision. Tax matters may therefore fall for consideration in the context of grounds for licence revocation\u2014a matter quite distinct from the separate issue (on which see below, paras. 115\u201427) of whether a new claim for tax fraud can be brought in the present proceedings.\n\n66.\n\nAmco\u2019s *sixth* and *seventh* contentions are (Observations on Res Judicata p. 2) that \"the finding that damages are to be paid in U.S. dollars outside Indonesia is *res judicata\";* and that \"the finding that the applicable date for converting to U.S. dollars any damage expressed in rupians is the date that the damage occurred.\"\n\n67.\n\nBoth of these findings were challenged by Indonesia as providing grounds for annulment. These challenges were considered and rejected by the Ad Hoc Committee (Decision, paras. 118-120). These findings clearly have the character of *res judicata* for purposes of these proceedings. (And see further paras. 83-84 below.)\n\n68.\n\nThese *sixth* and *seventh* contentions should therefore be added to the list provisionally indicated by the present Tribunal on 21 December 1987.\n\n*II. Matters Adverse to Either Party on the Merits, which have not been put before the Ad Hoc Committee for Annulment*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nAmco, in its *Observations on Res Judicata, 13 January 1988, at p. 5, Fifth Category of Findings,* includes in this category the following:2 (i) the finding that the treatment accorded Claimants by the Indonesian Courts did not constitute a denial of justice; (ii) the finding that BKPM, not just Parliament, had authority to revoke investment licences; (iii) the finding that Claimants were obligated to invest $3 million of foreign capital; (iv) the finding that loans should be excluded when calculating the amount of investment; (v) the finding that the foreign capital which claimants caused KLM and Mr. Pulitzer to invest in the hotel was not to be included in the investment calculation; (vi) the finding that P.T. Wisma was not acting as the *alter ego of* the Indonesian military in connection with the takeover of the hotel.\n\nNumbering added by the Tribunal for convenience of reference.\n\n70.\n\nAmco\u2019s contention is that none of these findings was essential to the Award and Claimants should therefore not be precluded from relitigating them.\n\n71.\n\nIndonesia identifies in this category (i) the decision that the Indonesian courts [have not]3 committed a denial of justice; and (ii) two of the modalities of payment with respect to any damages suffered by Amco group, the rate of interest (six per cent *per annum)* and the date it begins to run 0anuary 15, 1981).\n\nIndonesia confirmed to the Tribunal on March 11, 1988 that a typographical error in its claim should be amended to read as here shown\n\n72.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s contention is that these matters cannot be relitigated.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal is unable to accept Amco\u2019s contention. Matters decided by the first Tribunal but never put forward for annulment are binding on the parties and can not be relitigated. This is not because, as Indonesia suggests *(Observations,* January 14, 1988, p. 33) such matters are implicitly confirmed by the Ad Hoc Committee and are therefore binding, but simply because, never having been before the Ad Hoc Committee, they remain binding as *res judicata* of the first Tribunal. However, it follows from the present Tribunal\u2019s general approach to *res judicata* that, while unchallenged findings of the first Tribunal will constitute *res judicata,* not every incidental statement or procedural ruling made by the first Tribunal is to be treated as a \"finding\" to which this principle applies.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal now applies the principle above to the items listed by Amco and Indonesia.\n\n75.\n\nAs to item (i) listed by Amco, (the finding that the treatment accorded Claimants by the Indonesian courts did not constitute a denial of justice), the present Tribunal finds that this is *res judicata* as this issue was addressed and determined in the Award *(Award,* paras. 150 and 262) and was not annulled by the Ad Hoc Committee.\n\n76.\n\nAs to item (ii) listed by Amco (the finding that BKPM, not just Parliament, had authority to revoke investment licences), this was addressed and determined in the Award. The first Tribunal did not accept Indonesia\u2019s arguments that only Parliament had the power to cancellation *(Award,* para. 212 at p. 94).\n\n77.\n\nAs to item (iii) listed by Amco (the finding that claimants were obligated to invest S3 million of foreign capital, rather than a lesser amount up to $3 million) this was addressed and determined in the Award *(Award,* paras. 29 and 330).\n\n78.\n\nAs to item (iv) listed by Amco (the finding that loans should be excluded when calculating the amount of investment), this was addressed and determined in the Award *(Award,* para. 228).\n\n79.\n\nAs to item (v) listed by Amco (the finding that the foreign capital which Claimants caused KLM and Mr. Pulitzer to invest was not to be included in the investment calculation), this was addressed and determined in the Award *(Award,* para. 27).\n\n80.\n\nAs to item (vi) listed by Amco (the finding that P.T. Wisma was not acting as the *alter ego* of the Indonesian military in connection with the take over of the hotel) this was addressed and determined in the Award *(Award,* paras. 161\u201463).\n\n81.\n\nAll of these issues were definitely determined by the Tribunal and none of them was annulled by the Ad Hoc Committee. They are therefore *res judicata.*\n\n82.\n\nAs to item (i) listed by Indonesia (the decision that the Indonesian courts have not committed a denial of justice), the present Tribunal\u2019s views are given in para. 75 above.\n\n83.\n\nAs to item (ii) listed by Indonesia (that two of the modalities of payment (rate of interest and date from which it runs) are *res judicata,* the arguments of the parties may be summarised as follows. Indonesia contends that it had before the Ad Hoc Committee sought annulment by reference to findings in three different aspects of the modalities of payment\u2014US dollars as the currency of payment; the situs of payment to be outside of Indonesia; and the date of conversion of the payment currency. The Ad Hoc Committee rejected Indonesia\u2019s contentions, leaving the findings of the first Tribunal as *res judicata.* Two further aspects of the modalities of payment (rate of interest, date from which it runs) were never challenged, and thus likewise remain *res judicata.* Amco by contrast contended (see *Observations on Res Judicata, January* 13, 1988, p. 2) that, notwithstanding the fact that no challenge to the findings of the first Tribunal on interest rate and date were made before the Ad Hoc Committee, these matters are to be regarded as integral to the calculation of compensation; as the compensation amount had been set aside, these two items (not specifically affirmed as *res judicata* by the Ad Hoc Committee) can be relitigated.\n\n84.\n\nThe present Tribunal finds that the rate of interest and the date from which it runs no more or less integral to the calculation of compensation than the other modalities of payment. An unchallenged finding of an initial Tribunal remains *res judicata,* and it can readily be seen that it cannot be necessary for such a finding to be brought before an annulment committee (in the hope that an undesired challenge will be rejected) for it to be affirmed as *res judicata.*\n\n*III. Matters Expressly Annulled Can Therefore Be Relitigated*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe present Tribunal obviously affirms that matters expressly annulled may be relitigated, and agrees that two items identified by Indonesia\u2014(i) the restitution of the tax and import concessions granted to P.T. Amco and (ii) the quantum of damages (if any) owed to P.T. Amco for the period April 1 to July 9, 1980 (Observations on the Jurisdiction of the New Tribunal, January 14, 1988, p. 35) fall within this category. The present Tribunal observes, however, that this list is by no means exhaustive.\n\n*IV. Matters that Were Expressly Annulled but which Are Said To Be Res Judicata because of the Integrality of the Committee's Reasons*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nIn its Observations on the Jurisdiction of the New Tribunal of January 14, 1988, Indonesia acknowledges that certain findings have been annulled. However, adhering to its arguments that not only the Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s decision to annul certain portions of the Award is *res judicata,* but also matters that are \"integral to\" such findings, Indonesia lists six further items as *res judicata.* Amco, by contrast, contends that each of these matters can be relitigated, having been annulled by the Ad Hoc Committee. It is convenient to provide in full Indonesia's listing of items said to be *res judicata* under this head:\n\n(i) the Amco group did not satisfy their investment obligation and therefore the licence revocation was substantively justified and lawful;\n\n(ii) the calculation of the Amco group\u2019s actual investment;\n\n(iii) the materiality of the investment shortfall;\n\n(iv) the procedure relating to the licence revocation cannot *per se* support an award of damages;\n\n(v) damages due for wrongful acts of the army and police terminate on July 9, 1980;\n\n(vi) P.T. Amco\u2019s right to manage the hotel ended on July 9, 1980.\n\n87.\n\nAs indicated above, the present Tribunal is unable to accept the very broad view of *res judicata,* whereby matters said to be \"integral\" to nullity decisions of the Ad Hoc Committee are said to be binding, even if the conclusion to which they lead is the striking down of a prior finding by the Tribunal and a rehearing upon such prior findings.\n\n88.\n\nTurning to heading (i) above, the present Tribunal notes that this is an example of the Ad Hoc Committee treating the annulment ground under Article 52(1)(b)\u2014\"that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers\"\u2014as having been evidenced by a perceived failure to apply the applicable law, by virtue of its having been applied in a manner that reaches a conclusion believed untenable by the Ad Hoc Committee. The present Tribunal is clearly bound by the particular decision of the Ad Hoc Committee that the determination of the sum invested by the first Tribunal is nullified. It is clear from paragraph 98 of the Decision that the Ad Hoc Tribunal relied on at least two grounds for its conclusion. Further, if one turns to the Dispositif at p. 47 of the Decision and acknowledges general annulment subject to identifiable qualifications, this heading does not qualify as an identifiable qualification. Furthermore, neither an understanding of the distinction this Tribunal has already made (para. 40 above) between appeal from the merits and nullification under Article 52(1)(b), nor an understanding of the reasons given by the Ad Hoc Tribunal require the statements that Amco did not satisfy its investment obligation, and that the licence revocation was substantively justified, to be treated as *res judicata* rather than reopened for argument.\n\n89.\n\nThe same considerations apply to headings (ii) and (iii).\n\n90.\n\nAs for heading (iv), if the Ad Hoc Committee had stated not only that the award of damages was to be nullified, but also that Indonesian law properly understood did permit damages for procedural defects, the present Tribunal would have been bound (on its views of the scope of *res judicata* and on the critical distinction between appeal and nullification functions) to have reached the same conclusions as in i\u2014iii above.\n\n91.\n\nHowever, the situation is still less clear, in that the first Tribunal does not seem ever to have found in terms that procedural defects alone justify damages, nor has the Ad Hoc Committee clearly pronounced on this precise issue. At paragraphs 201\u2014202 of the Award the Tribunal explains its reasons for finding that the procedures did not afford due process of law to the claimants. At paragraph 74 of the Decision the Ad Hoc Tribunal notes that the Tribunal found it had to accept the BKPM revocation order as a definitive act, and it could do not more than \"award compensation to P.T. Amco for damages, if any, sustained by it from the definitive revocation order. The amount of such compensation was of course dependent on whether or not the revocation was justified on substantive grounds.\" It is not clear to this Tribunal why the Ad Hoc Committee in para. 10 refers to para. 74 to support the statement \"according to the findings of the Award itself, no compensation was due for the lack of three warnings and for other procedural defects of the revocation rider\" if BKPM was in fact justified in revoking the licence on substantive grounds.\n\n92.\n\nFor all of these reasons, item (iv) falls for reconsideration. In seeing whether damages are due, and if so in respect of what period, the present Tribunal is not precluded from itself examining whether there should be under Indonesian law an element reflecting damages for procedural violations.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to heading (v), namely that claim that damages due for wrongful acts of the army and police terminate on July 9, 1980. This matter has already been addressed above (at para. 51). It has been explained that there is a *res judicata* as to the unlawful acts of the police and army up to July 9, 1980, and compensation due for that period. (See para. 109 of the Decision). The finding that the period of violation (by virtue of the acts of police and army) continued beyond July 9 is nullified and therefore has to be determined afresh by this Tribunal.\n\n94.\n\nThe claim under (v), as formulated by Indonesia, would effectively require the present Tribunal to accept two tiers of reasoning to arrive at a finding of *res judicata.* The Ad Hoc Committee did not simply state that the Tribunal had acted in excess of powers or had failed to state reasons as to the substantive correctness of the licence revocation (which would clearly have required the substantive correctness of the licence revocation to be decided *de novo* by the present Tribunal). Instead, it offered the view that the substantive revocation was wrong; and proceeded from there to state that this entailed consequences turning on the date of July 9th. The present Tribunal does not accept that these two findings by the Ad Hoc Tribunal, obiter to the nullity function, constitute *res judicata.*\n\n95.\n\nAs for (vi), namely that P.T. Amco\u2019s right to manage the hotel ended on July 9, 1980, it is correct that in paragraph 107 of its Decision the Ad Hoc Committee states:\n\n\"As the withdrawal of the investment licence cannot be considered unjustified, the resulting effect of such withdrawal cannot be considered unjustified either, i.e., P.T. Amco\u2019s inability to exercise its right to manage the Kartike Plaza Hotel as of the day of issuance of the revocation order (July 9, 1980), whatever would have been the outcome of the litigation by P.T. Wisma against P.T. Amco before the Jakarta courts.\"\n\n96.\n\nHowever, for all the reasons elaborated above the present Tribunal finds that it has for itself to decide whether P.T. Amco had any right to manage beyond July 9, 1980, whether on grounds addressed by the first Tribunal or Ad Hoc Committee, or otherwise.\n\n97.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that all these items, viz. (i)\u2014(vi). are stated to be matters that cannot be relitigated because of the integrality of the Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s reasons. *(Observations on Jurisdiction of New Tribunal,* p. 34.) In fact, items (i)-(iv) in a sense relate to the Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s reasoning in reaching its nullity decisions, while (v) and (vi) are really stated consequences upon the nullity decisions (and indeed are dealt with under that description at p. 41 of the Decision). The present Tribunal notes that the consequence of annulment is stated in Article 52(6) to be submission of the dispute a new Tribunal, for its own consideration, should a party so request.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal here refers also to Indonesia\u2019s contention at p. 34 of its *Observations on the Jurisdiction of the New Tribunal.* Indonesia there contends that no unjust enrichment claim may be advanced by Amco because this would create \"a seemingly new argument to evade the legal force of *res judicata.\"* But unjust enrichment was never the subject matter of a finding by the first Tribunal, as although the issue had been advanced before that body, it reached its pertinent findings on other grounds. Even if the present Tribunal had found that the statement of the Ad Hoc Committee on the lawfulness of the licence revocation was *res judicata,* the claim of unjust enrichment could still be advanced in the present proceedings.\n\nD. JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE\n--------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nIn its Observations of January 14, 1988 on the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, the Republic of Indonesia objected to the jurisdiction *ratione personae* of Amco Asia. This objection was stated to be based on new facts that did not become known to Indonesia until after the date of the Award, namely, that Amco Asia, a company registered in Delaware was dissolved under the laws of Delaware on December 27, 1984, approximately one month after the rendering of the Award. A different company, bearing the name Amco Asia Corporation, was then incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware. It was said by Indonesia in its Observations of January 14, 1988 that this new company was created \"for the sole purpose of creating the semblance of its status on a claimant.\"\n\n100.\n\nHowever, at the oral hearings held in London on January 30th and February 1, 1988, Amco told the Tribunal that it was not suggested that Amco Asia Corporation was a claimant in the present arbitration. Rather, the situation was that Amco Asia continued in existence under the laws of the state of Delaware for purposes of this arbitration.\n\n101.\n\nHaving heard oral argument on this point, the Tribunal then invited the parties to make further brief written submissions on this issue. This Amco and Indonesia did, on February 22nd and 23rd, 1988 respectively.\n\n102.\n\nIt was agreed by both parties that the law which governs the dissolution of Amco Asia was the law of the state of Delaware. However, Indonesia drew a distinction between the dissolution of Amco Asia and the legal effect of such dissolution on the holder of rights and duties under an agreement to arbitrate. Indonesia contended that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provided the guide to the appropriate applicable law; and that Indonesian law only was to be applied. Indonesia stated that \"under Indonesian law, once a limited liability corporation is dissolved, it ceases to exist for any purpose\": *Supplementary Submissions on Jurisdiction,* February 23, 1988.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal does not believe that the distinction put forward by Indonesia leads to the conclusion that Indonesian law should apply. Nor does the Tribunal find it necessary to pronounce upon the respective place of Indonesian law and international law in Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n104.\n\nIndonesia stated in its *Supplementary Submissions on Jurisdiction* of February 23, 1988, at p. 17: \"Generally speaking, the question of whether a corporation has been terminated or suspended is determined by the local law of the state of incorporation... The analysis would not be different under Indonesian law.\" In the view of the Tribunal, the same rule applies to the question of whether that corporation is still an existing legal entity for a particular purpose. The rule as it applies to the effect of dissolution should not be different from the rule applied, in international contracts, to the effect of creation of such a corporation. When a company enters into an agreement with a foreign legal person, the legal status and capacity of that company is determined by the law of the state of incorporation. Similarly, one should apply the law of the state of incorporation to determine whether such a company, though dissolved, is still an existing legal entity for any specified legal purpose.\n\n105.\n\nThe dissolution of Amco Asia was governed by the law of the state of Delaware. Under Delaware law Amco Asia remains a juridical entity for purposes of any action, suit or proceeding begun by or against it prior to or within three years of dissolution or until such action, suit or proceeding is completed and any judgment, order or decree therein is executed: Section 278, Delaware General Corporation Law.\n\n106.\n\nDelaware law (as would be the case in most leading jurisdictions) regards arbitration as \"proceedings\": Section 122(2) Delaware Corporation Law.\n\n107.\n\nIt is also the case that Amco Asia is not prohibited by the law governing its dissolution from remaining in existence for purposes of this arbitration because of any failure to meet prescribed time limits. Section 278 of the Delaware General Corporation Law allows the continuation in existence of a dissolved corporation in respect of a proceeding begun by or against it \"either prior to or within three years after the date of its expiration or dissolution.\" The Tribunal finds correct the contention of Amco in its supplemental observations of February 22, 1988 that whether this arbitration is deemed to have been commenced on January 15, 1981 with the filing of the claimant\u2019s request for arbitration, or on May 12, 1987, with the filing of the claimant\u2019s request for resubmission, such arbitration would have been within the time limits presented by Delaware law.\n\n108.\n\nThus, the acknowledgement that Delaware law governs the dissolution of Amco Asia results only in the *status quo ante,* namely that Amco Asia continues in existence for purposes of the present arbitration. There is thus no \"consequence of dissolution,\" different from the *status quo ante,* to which Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention could be said to apply.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that it continues to have jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the dissolved Amco Asia.\n\nE. NEW CLAIMS/COUNTERCLAIMS\n---------------------------\n\n110.\n\nOn June 12, 1987 the Republic of Indonesia filed its Request for Resubmission. Amco had already filed its Request for Resubmission on May 12, 1987. In paragraph 4 of its Request Indonesia explained that by this separate Request it was resubmitting certain aspects of the investment dispute, rather than those submitted by Amco for decision by the new Tribunal. These were often aspects \"which it had asserted in the previous arbitration.\" Indonesia\u2019s claims were summarized on pp. 13-15 of its Request, item C of which, headed \"Tax Fraud,\" indicated that \"Indonesia further claims to recover corporate taxes that P.T. Amco has not paid to the Indonesian Government since 1973. Indonesia will submit further evidence in this arbitration providing a systematic course of tax evasion by P.T. Amco over many years.\" In a footnote Indonesia refers to \"the restitution of tax and other concessions and... tax fraud.\"\n\n111.\n\nIn its communication to the parties of 21 December 1987, the Tribunal invited observations on the following matter: \"May the parties bring before the present tribunal new claims and counterclaims arising out of this dispute or are they limited to the claims and counterclaims as formulated before the arbitral tribunal which gave its Award in December 1984.\" The observations of Amco on this matter were received on 20th January 1988 and of Indonesia on 21st January 1988. Amco contended that compensation for tax fraud was a new claim, or counterclaim, not made in the dispute submitted to the first Tribunal and that it should not be considered by the present Tribunal. Indonesia contended that the alleged tax fraud was raised in the first arbitration but was not decided. There being no decision on this point the Ad Hoc Committee found that there was nothing relevant for annulment *(Decision,* para. 124). (Indonesia had submitted the first Tribunal\u2019s decision not to consider the tax fraud as a ground for annulment.)\n\n112.\n\nIndonesia further contended that, even had the tax fraud claim not previously been raised, it could still be introduced as a new claim, or counterclaim, before the present Tribunal. This was subject to the qualification that a new claim not be *res judicata* as an underlying predicate of a finding of the Ad Hoc Committee, nor time-barred, and that it be otherwise within the present Tribunal\u2019s competence *ratione materiae.* According to Indonesia, the tax fraud claim met these qualifications and could therefore be introduced.\n\n113.\n\nAt the London hearings held on January 30th and February 1, 1988 the parties further addressed the Tribunal on this issue. At that time, Amco not only reasserted that the tax fraud had not been dealt with, save in rebuttal, before the first Tribunal, but also that it could not be introduced now as it was beyond the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the new Tribunal. At the conclusion of the hearings the parties were invited to provide brief supplementary submissions to assist the Tribunal in ascertaining whether indeed the matter of tax fraud had been before the first Tribunal, and on its competence *ratione materiae* to this matter. Memoranda were received from Amco on February 22, 1988 and from Indonesia on February 23, 1988.\n\n114.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal the issue falls to be decided in relation to three questions. *First,* is the claim of tax fraud a new claim or an old claim, in the sense that it had or had not been advanced before the first Tribunal? *Second,* if it is a new claim, are new claims in principle admissible before a new Tribunal established by request of the parties subsequent to annulment or partial annulment of the Award of the first Tribunal? And *third,* if the answer to the second question is in the affirmative, is this particular claim within the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal *ratione materiae?* It may be that a negative conclusion on either the second or third questions would make it unnecessary for the remaining questions to be solved by the Tribunal. However, the Tribunal believes that these matters raise issues of importance not only for the parties but also for the ICSID system generally, and has therefore resolved to address each of these questions in turn.\n\n*1. 'Tax Fraud\u2019 as an existing or new claim*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the written observations on the scope of claims and counterclaims of Indonesia of January 21 1988, and of Amco of January 20, 1988, the exhibits referred to therein, the relevant portions of the oral hearings in London at the end of January 1988, and the two further written submissions and exhibits submitted by Amco and Indonesia on February 22nd and 23rd 1988 respectively.\n\n116.\n\nWe find the evidence clear that the matter was referred to during the hearings on the merits before the first Tribunal, and that argument was addressed in some detail. It is equally clear, however, that the issue of tax fraud was advanced by Indonesia as one of the arguments justifying the licence revocation. It was raised as a defence in the course of argument, and not as a counterclaim.\n\n117.\n\nInsofar as that is the case, the question of whether the allegation relating to tax fraud was quantified, and whether, given the status of the evidence available to Indonesia at that time, it was possible to quantify in a more definitive manner, is academic.\n\n118.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this context the relevance of Rule 40 of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration proceedings. This provides:\n\n(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counterclaim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counterclaim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage of the proceeding.\n\n119.\n\nIt would seem that Indonesia, having sufficient information to advance argument on tax fraud at the Copenhagen hearings, was in a position to have sought to make a request at that time under Rule 40(2), although the actual formulation and quantification could, with the permission of the Tribunal, have been deferred. No such request to advance an additional claim was made.\n\n120.\n\nThe fact that argument was exchanged on the question of tax fraud, in the context of justifying the revocation of the license and in support of an \"unclean hands\" argument, does not mean that tax fraud was a claim in existence before the first Tribunal. For that to have been so, it would have been necessary for it to have been advanced as a counterclaim or as an additional claim under Rule 40.\n\n121.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to proceed to examine whether tax fraud may now be introduced as a new claim in the present proceedings.\n\n*2. Amco\u2019s contention that Tax Fraud is outside the Jurisdiction of the present Tribunal Ratione Materiae*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nIt is contended by Amco that the tax fraud claim would be precluded from being advanced *de novo* before the present Tribunal because it is not \"a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention. Given the finding of the Tribunal that the tax fraud issue was not a claim as such before the previous Tribunal, Amco is not estopped from raising this argument for the first time now. Amco contends, in its Supplemental Observations of February 22, 1988 that, even if subject matter jurisdiction under Article 25(1) is literally construed, and even if disputes relating to taxes are not *per se* excluded, \"it does not follow that every tax dispute with an investor is a dispute arising *directly* out of an investment.\" Amco argues that this particular tax dispute is related only in the most indirect way to the investment.\n\n123.\n\nIndonesia, by contrast, in its Supplemental Observations of February 23, 1988, points to the central place in its investment programme of tax concessions and advances arguments to show that ICSID jurisdiction covers tax matters, and that it must be permitted to a host state, as much as to an investor, to advance tax claims under the ICSID by them.\n\n124.\n\nIn fact, both parties agree, as does the Tribunal, that tax claims *may* be within ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and that claims in relation thereto would be available to both parties to an investment dispute.\n\n125.\n\nThe issue is therefore whether this particular claim falls within Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. In answering this question the Tribunal believes that it is correct to distinguish between rights and obligations that are applicable to legal or natural persons who are within the reach of a host State\u2019s jurisdiction, as a matter of general law; and rights and obligations that are applicable to an investor as a consequence of an investment agreement entered into with that host state. Legal disputes relating to the latter will fall under Article 25(1) of the Convention. Legal disputes concerning the former in principle fall to be decided by the appropriate procedures in the relevant jurisdiction unless the general law generates an investment dispute under the Convention.\n\n126.\n\nThe obligation not to engage in tax fraud is clearly a general obligation of law in Indonesia. It was not specially contracted for in the investment agreement and does not arise directly out of the investment.\n\n127.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal finds the claim of tax fraud beyond its competence *ratione materiae.*\n\n*3. May claims not presented to an ICSID Tribunal be advanced before a new Tribunal constituted under Article 52(6) of the Convention?*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nIn its communication of 21 December 1987 the Tribunal invited submissions from the parties on whether parties may bring before the present Tribunal claims and counterclaims other than those presented to the initial Tribunal.\n\n129.\n\nIn its Observations of 20 January 1988 Amco contended that Article 52(6) of the Convention provides that if an award is annulled \"the dispute shall, at the request of either party, be submitted to a new Tribunal...,\" and that different claims and counterclaims would \"constitute a different dispute.\" Indonesia, in its Observations of January 21 1988, emphasized a relationship between Article 52(6) and Article 25(1) of the Convention, and contended that what was required was to ensure that the jurisdiction of the new Tribunal did not go beyond what was permitted under Article 25(1). An ICSID dispute was \"the entire complex of issues between the patties relating to an investment. Accordingly, the ICSID Convention allows for the assertion of additional claims or counterclaims if they arise directly out of the subject matter of the dispute. Reference was made to Article 46 of the Convention, to Arbitration Rule 40, Note B(a), and to the ICSID Convention, Vol. II, Pt. 2, Documents Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention, p. 270. An Opinion was also entered by Dr. Aron Broches elaborating these arguments. While agreeing that the new Tribunal must check that any new claims arise directly out of the dispute, are within the scope of the consent of the parties, and are not *res judicata* (Rule 55(3)), Dr. Broches stated that otherwise parties are free to present new claims or counterclaims. Dr. Broches opined that \"there is no justification for arbitrarily reading into the Convention a restriction on a party\u2019s right to present claims or counterclaims other than the dispositive one of Arbitration Rule 55(3).\" In this context he referred to Article 46 of the Convention on the presentation of additional claims.\n\n130.\n\nArticle 46 provides:\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"\n\n131.\n\nBut Article 46 is to be read together with Rule 40, which provides specific procedures and time limits for the intervention of ancillary or additional claims, which, as noted above, have not been pursued here. It is also clear that Article 46 and Rule 40 are directed essentially to the question of additional claims presented before an ongoing single Tribunal hearing an arbitration and does not in terms address the issue of new claims and counterclaims as it may arise in relation to a new Tribunal under Article 52(6).\n\n132.\n\nNor is the matter resolved by reference to Article 25, for while indeed the jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to *\"any* legal dispute arising out of an investment\" Article 52(6) (which presupposes that Artide 25 jurisdiction already exists) states that if an award is annulled *\"the* dispute\" shall be submitted to a new Tribunal.\n\n133.\n\nArticle 52 is not a provision for starting a totally new arbitration, restricted only by the requirements of Article 25. Rather, it is a procedure for resubmission of an existing dispute in respect of which Article 25 jurisdiction exists.\n\n134.\n\nIn the present proceedings the Tribunal is meeting to reconsider an original award annulled only in part. The wording of Rule 55(3), which covers this situation, signifies that this is not a totally new proceeding constrained only by Article 25 (and by consideration of *res judicata).* It is a reconsideration of *the* dispute. Note B to Rule 55 speaks of the procedure for resubmission as being \"roughly analogous to that for an original request,\" and continues \"It is... especially important to... state in detail what aspects of the *former* dispute (the one to which the annulled award related) are to be considered by the new Tribunal.\" (Italics added.)\n\n135.\n\n\"A dispute\" in arbitration is to be understood not merely as subject matter within the scope of jurisdiction that is contested, nor even arguments that have been advanced in oral hearings and responded to. Argument is directed to supporting a dispute: it does not define the dispute. A dispute is defined by claims formally asserted and responded to in claim and defence, or in counterclaim and reply to counterclaim\u2014in other words, the causes of action.\n\n136.\n\n\"The\" dispute or \"the former\" dispute is necessarily the dispute as formulated in the pleadings before the first Tribunal whose Award (save insofar as it is res judicata) is now being reconsidered. The principle of finality to litigation also leads to the same view.\n\nFor all these reasons the Tribunal finds that the tax fraud issue is beyond its jurisdiction in the present proceedings.\n\nF. INDONESIA AS A NEW CLAIMANT/DEFENDANT\n----------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nThe Secretary General of ICSID has registered, on May 21 1987 and June 24 1987, two requests from Amco and Indonesia respectively, for the resubmission of the dispute under Article 52(6) of the Convention.\n\n138.\n\nIn its Resubmission Request and in its Submissions of January 14 1988 on the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, Indonesia has described itself as a Claimant, specifying in the latter document certain causes of action. Brief oral argument was also submitted by the parties at the hearing in London on January 30-February 1, 1988 on whether Indonesia has the status of a claimant, as well as a defendant, in these resubmitted proceedings.\n\n139.\n\nAs these proceedings are a resubmission of what is not *res judicata* in the dispute brought before the first Tribunal, the starting point is that the parties in this resubmission are in the same position as they were before the first Tribunal. The reconsideration by this Tribunal is not a totally new proceeding unrelated to the first proceeding.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered Indonesia\u2019s contention that not all of the arguments it wishes to advance could be placed before us, save by virtue of it being a claimant. The ability to advance new claims turns on the considerations we have identified above, (paras. l01 ff) and not on ones\u2019s status as claimant or defendant. And there is a great flexibility to introduce new or to expand existing argument, without any charge in designation as claimant or defendant.\n\n141.\n\nThe very fact the Secretary General has registered two requests for resubmission means that Indonesia is entitled to identify, as it sees fit, all the aspects of the existing dispute that are to be reconsidered.\n\n142.\n\nIndonesia is not disadvantaged by being in the position of defendant and the Tribunal rules that the pleadings on the merits should proceed on the basis adopted heretofore, so far as the respective positions of the parties are concerned."}, {"Title": "Award in Resubmitted Proceeding", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "1990-05-31T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award in Resubmitted Proceeding\n-------------------------------\n\n**I. BACKGROUND**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn January 15, 1981, Amco Asia Corporation (\u00abAmco Asia\"), Pan American Development Limited (\"Pan American\") and P.T. Amco Indonesia (\"PT Amco\") filed with the Secretary General of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Indonesia. When referred to collectively, the claimant companies will hereafter be designated as \"Amco\". The Tribunal established for purposes of that arbitration (\"the First Tribunal\") rendered an Award on Jurisdiction on September 25, 1983 (23 ILM (1984) 351). On November 20, 1984 it gave an Award on the Merits (1 Int.Arb.Rep. (1986) 601, \"the First Award\").\n\n2.\n\nThe First Award may be referred to for the full facts of the case. For convenience of reference, the following salient facts are here summarized:\n\nAn enterprise known as P.T. Bluntas was established in 1964 by the Bank of Indonesia and an Indonesian private investor to develop an apartment/hotel complex on a specified site in Jakarta. The structural framework of the basement and the first two floors was erected but construction stopped in 1965 due to lack of funds. In 1967, at the order of the new Indonesian government, all the shares in P.T. Bluntas were sold to a cooperative established under Indonesian law for the welfare of Indonesian army personnel, known as Inkopad. Inkopad caused the name of PT Bluntas to be changed to PT Wisma \"Kartika\" (hereafter referred to as \"PT Wisma\").\n\n3.\n\nOn 22 April 1968 a Lease and Management Agreement was entered into by Amco Asia, a company incorporated in Delaware, U.S.A., and PT Wisma, under which Amco Asia was to complete, at its own cost, the original construction (referred to in the Agreement as \"the Anne\"x) and another six storey building. The Agreement provided that Amco Asia would invest \"up to the sum of US$4,000,000\" overall, with \"up to the sum of US$3,000,000\" being used for the six storey building. PT Wisma was to grant Amco Asia a nineteen year lease for both structures. Any disagreements would be settled by negotiation, failing which there would be arbitration. The key terms of the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement are summarised in paragraph 11 of the First Award. The full text is to be found in the written pleadings submitted for this arbitration. (Exhibits to the Counter-Memorial,1 Volume 1, Tab.1.) An addendum to the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement was signed on May 18, 1968 by PT Amco and PT Wisma, specifying how the profits were to be shared. The enterprise was known as the Hotel Kartika Plaza project. (Ibid, Tab.2).\n\nHereafter referred to as \"Indonesia Exh.\".\n\n4.\n\nOn May 6, 1968 Amco Asia submitted to the Government of Indonesia an application (Previously Filed Claimants' Documents Cited in Amco's Memorial, Vol.I, Tab.5; Indonesia Exh., Vol.I, Tab.4) to establish PT Amco under the aegis of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law (Previously Filed Claimants\u2019 Documents, Vol.I, Tab.l). The application underwent various amendments (Indonesia Exh., Vol.I, Tab.5). The authorised share capital of PT Amco was to be $3,000,000, divided into 30,000 shares with a nominal value of $100 per share, all of which \"represented foreign capital\". In the amended application it was proposed that there be an exemption from corporate taxes for three years; and for dividend tax for three years. PT Amco was to be exempt from import duties with respect to capital goods, including spares and parts, if PT Amco used \"its own foreign exchange or supplemental foreign exchange in the limits set in the Government regulations in force\". (Indonesia Exh., Volume I, Tabs. 4 and 5). The application also included an arbitration clause which referred any dispute between PT Amco and the Government of Indonesia to ICSID. On July 29, 1968, Amco Asia was granted permission by the Minister of Public Works to establish PT Amco within the framework of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law and in accordance with the amended application.\n\n5.\n\nAs described in the Award of the First Tribunal, (paras.37-39), PT Amco's Articles of Incorporation set a final date for capitalisation. The Articles of Incorporation were set out in a Notarial Document No. 106 dated September 27, 1968, upon request of the Minister of Justice amended by Notarial Document No.49 dated December 13, 1968. At the time of the incorporation, 20 per cent of the authorised capital was declared issued with 10 per cent having been paid up, half of which was issued to and paid for by Amco Asia and the other half issued to and paid for by a non-resident Dutch business man, Mr. T.K. Tan (First Award, para,37). In the Notarial Document No.49 a new provision was added to the Articles of Incorporation, viz. that \"the entire unissued portion of shares must be issued within a period of 10 years beginning today, unless this time should be extended by those responsible, or if required at the request of the Board of Directors\". No evidence of any decision to extend the time period of 10 years was put before the First Tribunal (First Award, para.39). Under the Articles of Incorporation, the issue of the US$3m. shares should have taken place before the end of 1978.\n\n6.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation of PT Amco were then prepared and presented to the Ministry of Justice for approval. To meet the position of the Ministry, various notarial documents were executed to effect changes to the Articles of Incorporation (First Award, paras.33-40). On January 25, 1969 the Minister of Justice approved the Articles of Incorporation, which were then registered with the Central Jakarta District Court on January 29, 1969. On April 4, 1969, the Articles of Association were published in Supplement No.27 to the State Gazette of Indonesia No.41 of 1969 (Ibid,, para.40).\n\n7.\n\nOn January 24, 1969 FT Wisma agreed to extend the term of the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement to thirty years.2 On August 22 1969 FT Amco entered into a Sub-Lease Agreement whereby certain other persons and airlines would manage and operate the Kartika Plaza hotel, and would guarantee credit facilities to PT Amco to enable it to complete the construction of the hotel. On October 13 1970 a second sub-lease was entered between PT Amco and the Aeropacific Hotel Association (\"Aeropacific\"), a partnership consisting of the same sub-lessees as in the sub-lease of August 22, 1969 (Ibid., Tab.42). Aeropacific was to complete construction of the hotel and also assumed responsibility for a loan of US$1,000,000 from Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. (\"ABN\") that PT Amco had undertaken to obtain under the first sub-lease agreement. PT Wisma and Amco Asia agreed in writing to respect the terms of this second sub-lease, which was to supersede the first. The second sub-lease continued in operation until June 1, 1978. Relations between PT Amco and Aeropacific gave rise to problems and led to arbitration and then to resolution by agreement on March 29, 1980. (First Award, para.77).\n\nThe lease was originally granted for 19 years. In the letter of January 24, 1969 (Previously Filed Claimants' Documents, Vol.I, Tab.4; Indonesia Exh., Vol.I, Tab.3) it gets extended to 30 years, which is said to be 10, years more than that originally granted. See also the reference in para.52 of the First Tribunal's Award to 20 years. In any event, the subsequent 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement (Indonesia Exh. Vol.II, Tab.47) was to terminate September 30, 1999.\n\n8.\n\nIn 1971 PT Amco sought recognition from the Ministry of Public Works of Pan American Development Limited (\"Pan American\"), a Hong Kong company, as a capital investor in the Hotel Kartika Plaza project, stating that Amco Asia had in fact entered into the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement with PT Wisma as agent and nominee for and on behalf of Pan American, The Ministry of Public Works in turn notified the Foreign Investment Board that permission was required to transfer a portion of Amco Asia's shares to Pan American. This transfer was approved on May 1, 1972. (Ibid., paras.41-45).\n\n9.\n\nFaced with legal skirmishing between PT Amco and Aeropacific during the first few months of 1978, Inkopad undertook the management of the hotel, from June, 1978. However, after a few months, in light of its difficulties in administering the property without the assistance of a professional manager and following representations by Amco, Inkopad authorised PT Wisma to enter with PT Amco into a \"Profit-Sharing Agreement for the Management of the Kartika Plaza Land and Building with all its contents\" (Ibid., paras.77-78). That Agreement was signed on October 6, 1978 and PT Amco resumed management of the hotel. On July 4, 1979, with the Agreement of PT Wisma, PT Amco entered into a Licence Agreement and an International Management Agreement with Ramada Inns Inc. and Ramada International Inc., respectively. From November 1979 to March 31, 1980 PT Wisma and PT Amco were in disagreement on a number of matters (listed at paragraph 87 of the First Award). Particularly important was the disagreement concerning the amounts which the respective parties thought were due from PT Amco to PT Wisma under the Profit Sharing Agreement of 1978. PT Amco stated that it was not in a position to finalise all figures but denied that US$54,609 was still due to PT Wisma (Ibid., para.88). PT Wisma indicated that if it was not paid by specified dates (first set at March 15, and then at March 30, 1980),3 then the management of the Kartika Plaza building would be conducted by PT Wisma as the owner (Ibid, para.89).\n\nThe First Award speaks of March 15, 1978. which is surely a misprint.\n\n10.\n\nA small advance was made by PT Amco but it did not pay the full US$54,609 claimed. In the last few days of March various meetings were held by senior executives of PT Wisma at which plans were made for the taking of sole control of the Kartika Plaza property (Ibid., paras.90-92). On March 31, 1980 PT Wisma notified all Managers and Department Heads that henceforth the responsibility for the management of the Kartika Plaza and Hotel was to lie with a Management Council established by PT Wisma (Ibid., para.93). After reviewing the conflicting evidence about the presence of military personnel at the hotel during March 31st and April 1st and thereafter (ibid,, paras.97-109), the First Tribunal declared that it was \"satisfied that on or about the critical period there was a taking of the claimants' rights to the control and management of the land and all the Kartika Plaza building\" (Ibid ., para.155). Further, the First Tribunal was \"satisfied that a number of army and police personnel were present at the hotel premises on the 1st April, 1980 and by their very presence assisted in the successful seizure from PT Amco of the exercise of its lease and management rights\" (Ibid ., para.155).\n\n11.\n\nAfter intervention by the army and police on March 31/April 1 1980, Colonel Soejupto, Chief Executive of PT Wisma, issued a \"Decree or Letter of Decision\" whereby a Management Council, to be chaired by Lt. General R. Soerjo, was given the authority to manage the property, and PT Amco was relieved of its management role. (lbid., para.92). The First Tribunal found that \"[o]n the basis of the proven actions and omissions of the army/police personnel in connection with the takeover the Tribunal cannot but draw the conclusion that an internationally wrongful act was committed and that this act is attributable to the Government of Indonesia which therefore is internationally responsible\", (Ibid., para.172).\n\n12.\n\nAfter PT Wisma took over control and management of the Kartika Plaza on March 31/April 1, 1980, it reported certain information to the Capital Investment Coordinating Board (Bodas Koordinasi Penannanam Modal, hereafter \"BKPM\"). This body is responsible for examining applications by foreign investors, making recommendations to the Indonesian government and supervising the implementation of approved investments. After holding meetings with, and receiving further information from, representatives of PT Wisma, a report made by Mr. Usman of BKPM recommended that PT Amco's Foreign Capital Investment Licence be reviewed. Pursuant to a request by the Chairman of BKPM on May 12, 1980 for guidance, the termination of the licence was approved by the President of Indonesia and on July 9, 1980 BKPM revoked PT Amco's licence. (For details see First Award, paras.110-130).\n\n13.\n\nOn April 24, 1980 PT Wisma filed a suit claiming that PT Amco had failed to perform its investment and reporting obligations required by BKPM and the Bank of Indonesia and asked the Central Jakarta District Court to rescind the 1968 Management and Lease Agreement, as amended, and the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement. On May 28, 1980, two days before PT Amco was notified of the suit, the Court granted ex parte PT Wisma's request for an interlocutory decree giving PT Wisma the right to manage the Kartika Plaza pending the final outcome of the suit. PT Wisma was ordered to make a monthly accounting of its management. On July 8, 1980 the Greater Jakarta Court granted PT Amco\u2019s request to postpone application of the interlocutory decree. On July 28, 1980 PT Wisma appealed this judgment, notifying the Indonesian Supreme Court that BKPM had revoked PT Amco's licence. On August 4, 1980, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Greater Jakarta Court.\n\n14.\n\nThe case now returned to the courts for hearings on the merits. By November 1983 it had reached the Jakarta Appellate Court, which found in favour of PT Wisma. (For details, see First Award, paras.134-141).\n\n15.\n\nIn bringing a case before the First Tribunal, PT Amco claimed that Indonesia had seized its investment in the building and management of the Kartika Plaza complex and then unjustifiably cancelled its investment licence. Indonesia contended that any military or public assistance was only directed to supporting the legal right of PT Wisma to control the hotel and was not a seizure of the hotel by the government. It denied PT Amco's claim that the cancellation of the investment licence was unlawful, both procedurally and substantively, and that the courts had acted in an unlawful manner in rescinding the Lease and Management Agreement. In its counterclaim Indonesia asserted that, as the cancellation of the investment licence was justified, PT Amco was obliged to return tax and other concessions granted by Indonesia. A full description of the claims, defences and counterclaim are to be found at paragraphs 142-146 of the First Award.\n\n16.\n\nThe First Tribunal found in favour of the claimants, ordering the sum of US$3,200,000 with interest to be paid, outside of Indonesia. Indonesia's counterclaim was rejected. Orders were also made as to fees, expenses, arbitrators' fees and expenses and charges for the use of the facilities of ICSID.\n\n17.\n\nOn March 18, 1985 the Republic of Indonesia filed with the Secretariat of ICSID an application under Article 52 of the Convention, for the annulment of the First Award which had been made on November 20, 1984. An Ad Hoc Committee was established pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. The Ad Hoc Committee ordered, and later confirmed, a stay of enforcement upon the furnishing by Indonesia of an irrevocable and unconditional bank guarantee.\n\n18.\n\nWritten pleadings and oral hearings ensued in 1985 and 1986. On May 16, 1986 the Ad Hoc Committee rendered its Decision (1 Int.Arb.Rep. (1986) 649; 25 ILM (1986) 1439). It decided to annul the First Award \"as a whole for the reasons and with the qualifications set out above.\" (Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee, final para.). The annulment did not extend to the First Tribunal's findings that the action of the army and police personnel on March 31/April 1, 1980 was illegal. The annulment did however extend to the findings on the duration of such illegality and on the amount of the indemnity due on this account. (Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee, p.47).\n\n19.\n\nOn May 12, 1987, pursuant to Article 52(6)4 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 55 of the Arbitration Rules, Amco submitted to the Secretary General of ICSID a Request for Resubmission of a Dispute. On June 12, 1987, Indonesia submitted to the Secretary General of ICSID a Request for Resubmission of a Dispute. On October 20, 1987 the present Tribunal (\"the Tribunal\") was constituted. On December 21, 1987 the Tribunal issued a Provisional Indication as to what determinations of the First Tribunal had been annulled by virtue of the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee and what remained as res judicata. On January 13, 1988 Amco submitted written observations and exhibits on the res judicata effect of the First Award in view of the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee on May 16, 1986. On January 14, 1988 Indonesia submitted its written observations, exhibits and an expert Legal Opinion on these matters. Various other jurisdictional matters were contested. On January 30 and February 1, 1988 oral hearings were held in London on jurisdiction, including on questions of res judicata.\n\nIn fact, Amco referred to Article 53 of the Convention.\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal considered the representations of the parties in deciding on the scope and effect of the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee to annul the First Award, with certain qualifications. On May 10, 1988, the Tribunal gave its Decision on Jurisdiction (3 ICSID Review - Foreign Investment Law Journal 166 (1988); 27 ILM (1988) 1281).\n\n21.\n\nThe parties filed the following briefs on the merits, along with extensive legal and factual exhibits:5\n\nClaimants' Memorial, July 11, 1988.  \nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, September 12, 1988.  \nClaimants' Reply, October 17, 1988.  \nRespondent's Rejoinder, November 14, 1988.\n\nA variety of correspondence on different issues has occurred between the parties and the Tribunal; and action (including certain interlocutory decisions) has been taken upon this correspondence as necessary.\n\nSeveral of the factual exhibits had not been produced before the First Tribunal.\n\n22.\n\nHearings on the merits were held in Washington, D.C. from September 18 to 29, 1989. The following witnesses testified:\n\nMs. S. Pellaupessy Mr. W.S. Djohari  \nDr. A. Noer  \nMr. N. Hanafi  \nMr. E. Abdurrachman  \nMr. D. Mathias Professor D. Dapice\n\ncalled by Indonesia.\n\nMr. J. Fox\n\ncalled by Amco.\n\nDuring these hearings oral argument was presented for the Claimants by\n\nMr. William Rand  \nMr. Robert Hornick  \nMr. Paul Friedland.\n\nOral argument was presented for the Respondents by Ms. Carolyn Lamm\n\nMr. Charles Brower  \nProfessor Sudargo Gautama  \nMr. Aldo Badini.\n\nII. THE CLAIMS, DEFENCES AND COUNTERCLAIM\n-----------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nIn its Request for Resubmission Amco advanced five essential claims: namely, that by reason of wrongful acts of the Indonesian army and police, it had suffered damage; that in revoking its licence, BKPM gave Amco no proper warning and denied it a fair hearing, a chance to rebut charges or to make good any deficiencies; that BKPM was not substantively justified in revoking the licence on either of the two grounds given in its revocation order: that the rescission by the Indonesian courts of Amco's Lease and Management Agreement was wrongful because it had no proper jurisdiction of the action and no evidence was presented of breach of contract; and that Indonesia was unjustly enriched as a consequence of these unlawful acts. Damages of \"not less than US$15,000,000\" were claimed.\n\n24.\n\nThe Republic of Indonesia, in its own Request for Resubmission, claimed that as Amco had breached its licence, it must make restitution of tax and other concessions granted only by virtue of the licence. These were itemized as a US$77,955 exemption from capital stamp duties; a Rp. 29,691,965 exemption from company tax in 1972, together with penalties and interest; and a Rp. 424,348,207.08 exemption from customs duties (US$1,022,525.70 at the prevailing exchange rate). Indonesia further claimed tax allegedly evaded by Amco since 1973, estimated to be in excess of US$150,000. In addition, Indonesia claimed that, as a provisional measure pursuant to Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Amco should pay to Indonesia one half of the cost of the annulment proceeding, which amounted to US$103,313.75, with accrued interest until the date of effective payment.\n\n25.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction of May 10, 1988, the Tribunal found that the tax fraud claim was beyond its jurisdiction. The Tribunal further ruled that the pleadings on the merits should proceed with the parties being in the respective positions they were before the First Tribunal. Indonesia's remaining claim in its Request for Resubmission thus became, in the proceedings on the merits, a counterclaim.\n\n26.\n\nIn its Memorial, Amco characterised its first cause of action variously as assistance by Indonesia in \"the unlawful taking of the hotel from Amco on or about April 1, 1980\" (p.21) and as \"an unlawful taking of an interest in a hotel\" (ibid). Indonesia, in its Counter-Memorial, asserted that the only loss from the activities of the army and police was a temporary loss of Amco\u2019s right of control over the hotel; and that that loss ended either on the date of the licence revocation (9 July 1980) or when the army and police left the hotel in October 1980.\n\n27.\n\nAmco did not break down its quantification of loss claimed for the \"taking of the hotel\" or of the \"interest in a hotel\" into periods related to claims against the army and police, BKPM and the courts. It advanced a global claim for this loss. By contrast, Indonesia claimed that the temporary loss of control by Amco caused by the army and police action (the illegality of which was res judicata pursuant to this Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction) had no intrinsic value. In oral argument it was thus said there was either no quantifiable damage or the damage was de minimis.\n\n28.\n\nAmco contended in its Memorial that damages due \"for the taking\" (p.27) were not \"cut off by\" (i.e. did not terminate upon) the licence revocation (the second cause of action), which was procedurally unlawful (which finding this Tribunal had in its Decision on Jurisdiction held to be res judicata). In its Memorial Amco affirmed that violation of due process gave rise of itself to compensation. This was denied by Indonesia, which took the position in its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder that procedural irregularities must be shown to be the cause of any injury before damages are due; and that the damage was caused by PT Amco's own failures, which led to a lawful revocation of the licence by BKPM.\n\n29.\n\nAmco also contended that its entitlement to compensation was not \"cut off by\" the Indonesian Supreme Court decision of April 30, 1985, which affirmed lower court judgments terminating the Lease and Management Agreement. Although it was res judicata that these lower court judgments did not terminate any rights to compensation held by Amco, Indonesia claimed in its Counter-Memorial that the Supreme Court decision, being the final judicial recourse, had this effect.\n\n30.\n\nIn its Memorial Amco's second cause of action concerned the unlawfulness of the licence revocation. Amco contended that compensation was due for the procedural violations by BKPM, regardless of any substantive grounds. Amco further contended that BKPM's substantive decision to revoke the licence was unlawful. Two arguments were advanced in support of this claim. First, there had been two stated grounds of revocation, but one of these had been found by the first Tribunal to be unlawful (a finding that was res judicata). The remaining single ground by itself was not sufficient to sustain the substantive finding. Second, the remaining ground of under-investment and under-registration of foreign equity capital was said to be invalid.\n\n31.\n\nIndonesia rejected each of these arguments and further found that the licence revocation was valid on other grounds also, even if these were not explicitly relied on in the revocation decision.\n\n32.\n\nAmco's third cause of action was that Indonesia would be unjustly enriched if permitted both to retain the benefits of Amco\u2019s investment and the earnings which Amco could have made from its investment. Indonesia, denying that Indonesian law knew the concept of unjust enrichment or that international law regarded it as a distinct rather than merely ancillary right, said that it was not Indonesia but rather PT Wisma that had benefitted from hotel revenues. Any benefit to Indonesia from PT Amco\u2019s investment was too indirect, speculative and unquantifiable.\n\n33.\n\nPT Amco had in its Request for Resubmission quantified globally the damage claimed to be due, setting it at US$15,000,000, plus interest compounded annually at a rate per annum equal to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate plus 1% from April 1, 1980, the date of effective payment. However, in the Memorial the sum claimed was US$10,171,000. The First Tribunal had found interest to be owed at the Indonesian statutory rate of 6% per annum from January 15, 1981 to the date of effective payment. Amco claimed in its Memorial that, although this. finding was res judicata, it was inapplicable in the present arbitration because Indonesian law makes market rate interest applicable to monetary awards for wrongful acts and for unjust enrichment claims. Indonesia contended that the res judicata character of the finding of the first Tribunal did not permit of such arguments.\n\n34.\n\nIndonesia also made a counterclaim in its CounterMemorial for the restitution of all monies which would have been paid by PT Amco, for example as tax and import duties, but for the tax holiday granted by the licence. This was done on the basis that under Indonesian law a failure to comply with foreign investment law resulted in the withdrawal of all the facilities that had been granted from the date of their approval. These sums were quantified at US$1,936,914.92.\n\n35.\n\nFor the determination of these issues the Tribunal has had the benefit of the oral and written submissions of the parties, and the witnesses who testified. The Tribunal has also had access to the transcript of argument and testimony before the First Tribunal.\n\nIII. ISSUES TO BE DETERMINED\n----------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction identified what issues of the First Tribunal are res judicata for purposes of the present Tribunal, and what issues may be reargued. The claims, defences and counterclaims of the parties have been formulated accordingly. The issues have, quite naturally, been approached by the parties in ways that are not identical. In resolving those aspects of the dispute between Amco and Indonesia on which there are no res judicata findings of fact or law, the Tribunal finds that the following issues arise:\n\n- What is the applicable law?\n\n- What was the damage caused to Amco by the unlawful acts of army and police?\n\n- Did Indonesia's responsibility by virtue of the acts of the army and police continue beyond July 9, 1980?\n\n- What is the compensation due for any damage shown to be caused by the acts of the police and army?\n\n- Does the procedurally unfair character of the BKPM decision to revoke Amco's licence (which finding remains res judicata for this arbitration) per se entitle Amco to damages; and if so how are these damages to be assessed?\n\n- Was the BKPM decision unlawful, either by virtue of procedural irregularities, or for substantive reasons?\n\n- If the liability of Indonesia continued beyond the date of revocation by BKPM, was it brought to an end by the judgment of the Supreme Court of Indonesia on April 30, 1985, affirming the findings of the lower courts that the Lease and Management Agreement should be rescinded?\n\n- If BKPM\u2019s decision to revoke Amco's licence is unlawful, what compensation is due?\n\n- What are the relevant principles of any due compensation?\n\n- What are the techniques by which any due compensation is to be calculated?\n\n- If BKPM's revocation of Amco's licence is lawful, is Amco required to repay all tax and other concessions which it received by virtue of the licence?\n\nIV. APPLICABLE LAW\n------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe question of applicable law was not specifically addressed in the written pleadings of the parties. Amco simply noted that \"where... the law of the host state contains no express rule on the point, the Tribunal is authorized under Article 42(1) [of the ICSID Convention] to look to international law\" and cited the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee in the case of Kl\u00f6ckner v. Cameroon (Memorial, p.24; XI Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration, (1986) p.162). Indonesia, in both its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder, advanced legal arguments on each of the issues under first, the heading of Indonesian law and second, the heading of international law. In oral argument, however, Mr. Brower explained that international law was only relevant if there was a lacuna in the law of the host state, or if the law of the host state was incompatible with international law, in which case the latter would prevail. Indonesia provided the Tribunal with many authorities and with travaux pr\u00e9paratoires of the ICSID Convention, said to sustain its view on the applicable law under Article 42(1).\n\n38.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\nThe First Tribunal stated that\n\n\"[t]he parties having not expressed an agreement as to the rules of law according to which the disputes between them should be decided, the Tribunal has to apply Indonesian law, which is the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute, and such rules of international law as the Tribunal deems to be applicable, considering the matters and issues in dispute.\" (First Award, para.148).\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee, in its Annulment Decision, stated that it considered Article 42 \"controlling, in exactly the same way that the Tribunal regarded the same article decisive of the law governing the substantive dispute before it.\" (Decision on Annulment, para. 19). The Ad Hoc Committee then went on to state that Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention \"authorises an ICSID tribunal to apply rules of international law only to fill up lacunae in the applicable domestic law and to ensure precedence to international law norms where the rules of the applicable law are in collision with such norms\" (ibid, para.20). The role of international law is thus \"supplemental and corrective\" under Article 42(1) (ibid, para.22).\n\n39.\n\nAmco submitted no contrary arguments or authorities on the question of applicable law, and there was no contested issue between the parties on this matter.\n\n40.\n\nThis Tribunal notes that Article 42(1) refers to the application of host-state law and international law. If there are no relevant host-state laws on a particular matter, a search much be made for the relevant international laws. And, where there are applicable host-state laws, they must be checked against international laws, which will prevail in case of conflict. Thus international law is fully applicable and to classify its role as \"only\" \"supplemental and corrective\" seems a distinction without a difference. In any event, the Tribunal believes that its task is to test every claim of law in this case first against Indonesian law, and then against international law.\n\nV. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FINDING OF THE FIRST TRIBUNAL THAT THE CONDUCT OF THE ARMY AND POLICE CONSTITUTED AN UNLAWFUL ACT FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA IS INTERNATIONALLY RESPONSIBLE.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn the First Award, certain findings were made relating to the role of the army and police. The First Tribunal found that the events of April 1, 1980 onwards deprived Amco of the right to operate the hotel. Referring also to the revocation of the licence, the First Tribunal described \"the prejudice suffered\" as consisting of \"the loss of incorporeal, patrimonial and potentially profitable rights\" (First Award, para.253). Having then established a causal link between the \"prejudice suffered\" by loss of the right to operate the hotel, and the illegal acts of the army and police (para.257), the First Tribunal then proceeded to determine damages. It did not make a distinction between damages related to prejudice caused by the acts of the army and police, and prejudice caused by the licence revocation.\n\n42.\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee, while nullifying the conclusions of the First Tribunal on the calculation and the amount of the investment made by Amco, and on the non-materiality of the shortfall, upheld the findings of illegality of the acts of the army and police (Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee, para.60). Further, in a section entitled \"On the grant of damages resulting from the action by Army and Police personnel\", the Ad Hoc Committee reiterated that it did not annul \"this part of the Award, nor the finding that Amco is entitled to damages from Indonesia\". (Ibid,., para.108.)\n\n43.\n\nAfter the Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee, and the requests by the parties for the resubmission of the dispute, the present Tribunal noted that there was agreement between the parties that \"the responsibility of Indonesia to compensate PT Amco for damages for the events of March 31-April l, 1980\" was res judicata (Decision on Jurisdiction, paras.48-49). It further held that it was also res judicata that compensation would be due for the unlawful acts of the army and police up to July 9, 1980 (para.93). The finding that violation by virtue of the acts of the police and army continued beyond July 9th was however nullified and thus fell to be considered afresh by the present Tribunal.\n\n44.\n\nIn its Counter Memorial in the present proceedings, Indonesia claimed that\n\n\"PT Amco's loss as a consequence of the activities of the Army and Police was at most the loss of its non-exclusive right to manage... Its value, if any, was de minimis.\" (Counter Memorial, pp. 109-110).\n\n45.\n\nIn its Reply Amco contested that this ignored the finding of the First Tribunal that:\n\n\"[w]hile it is right to say that the claimants' deprivation of the rights they had acquired did not result from this de facto dispossession, the fact of the matter is that the actual prejudice they suffered, consisting in the deprivation of the profit they were entitled to expect by exercising said rights, commenced on April 1, 1980, and that at this date, the cause of the prejudice was the dispossession: in other words, during this very first stage, there was effectively a causal link between the dispossession and the prejudice.\" (First Award, para.257, cited at p.5 Reply).\n\nAmco thus took the view that it was not open to Indonesia, given the findings of this Tribunal on res judicata, to contest that harm had occurred consisting of the deprivation of the profits to which they were entitled; only the amount and its calculation could be contested before this Tribunal.\n\n46.\n\nAs indicated above (paras.42-43), it is res judicata that the army and police acted unlawfully in respect of the events of March 31-April 1 1980; that PT Amco suffered prejudice thereby; and that it is the responsibility of Indonesia to compensate for such prejudice. However, the precise nature of the prejudice suffered during this period and its quantification remain issues properly open before this Tribunal.\n\n47.\n\nThe title to the hotel building and land was held by PT Wisma and the support of the army and police in the actions of March 31-April 30 thus did not expropriate the hotel as such. The rights held by PT Amco in relation to the hotel were rights of management and control on the one hand, and of participation in the profits on the other. Indonesia contended that rights of management and control have no inherent value, but are rights ancillary to the entitlement to a share of the profit. Indonesia claimed that unless it could be shown that the loss of rights of management and control caused a diminution of profits by comparison to what would have been achieved if Amco had retained management, loss of management rights of itself occasioned no harm to Amco and thus gave rise to no compensation.\n\n48.\n\nIndonesia in oral argument elaborated its position that while the action of the army and the police was relevant to the loss of management and control, it did not mean that Amco could not continue to receive the share of profits to which it was entitled under its 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement with PT Wisma. Amco contended that paragraph 257 of the First Award (see above, para.45) made it res judicata that the dispossession effected by the army and police did indeed prevent the receipt by Amco of its share of the profits.\n\n49.\n\nThe wording of paragraph 257 is not entirely easy. It is not certain whether, in its reference to \"deprivation of the profit they were entitled to expect\", the First Tribunal was referring to a de facto inability to receive, from April to July 1980, its share of the profits under the 1978 Agreement; or whether it was rather saying that the legal right to secure profits from the Hotel Kartika venture was ultimately lost by the revocation decree of July 9th, the path to which began with the dispossession of March 31-April 1. It is not sufficiently clear to the present Tribunal which meaning was intended by the First Tribunal; and neither the Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s Decision at paragraph 109 nor the present Tribunal's Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 93, makes a finding on this particular aspect.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that paragraph 257 is not to be understood as entailing a res judicata in the sense contended for by Amco (para.42, infra). The Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee was to annul with qualifications, one such being the illegality of the acts of the army and police. But paragraph 257 goes beyond mere affirmation of such illegality and is therefore not to be treated as res judicata. Accordingly, the Tribunal therefore finds that, while it is res judicata that the army and police acted unlawfully up to July 9, 1980, and that some compensation is due therefor, it is necessary to identify exactly what rights were lost; and in respect of any so lost, the damage caused.\n\n51.\n\nIn a situation where management is not being paid a fee under a management service contract, its remuneration lies in the commercial importance that management will have on profitability. The evidence before the Tribunal indicates that the 1980 results were significantly above those for 1979. This was true of the first quarter of 1980 (under the PT Amco management) as much as for the rest of the year. It also may have been the case that 1979 had been an unusually poor year for hotels in Jakarta. On the other hand, the Tribunal has no way of knowing what the profit levels would have been during 1980 under Amco management.\n\n52.\n\nWhatever the level of profitability, Amco take the view that as of April 1, 1980, de facto they were unable to secure their entitlement to their share of profits; and read paragraph 257 of the First Award as affirming this. Put differently, Amco contends that the loss of their rights under the Profit-Sharing contract of 1978 occurred on April 1, 1980. In Amco's view April l marked the date of taking their profit-sharing rights and was thus the date at which those rights were to be valued for compensation purposes.\n\n53.\n\nIndonesia insists that, notwithstanding unlawful action by the military and police, there was no taking of PT Amco's profit share rights on April 1, for two reasons. First, the events of March 31-April 1 dispossessed PT Amco of its right to manage, but did not at all touch upon its a right to a share of profits under the Profit-Sharing Agreement. Second, any difficulty PT Amco might have experienced in securing these profits was a matter between PT Wisma and PT Amco. Even if PT Wisma had refused to allow PT Amco its share of the profits, such act should not be attributed to the Government of Indonesia, PT Wisma being a legally distinct body.\n\n54.\n\nOn this last point the Tribunal notes that PT Amco's current management rights were held under the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement with PT Wisma and notice of their termination was issued by PT Wisma, and not the Government of Indonesia. Nonetheless, the First Tribunal found Indonesia responsible for acts which led to the dispossession of PT Amco from its rights. By the same token, if PT Amco's entitlement to participation in the profits was taken from it at the same moment, it cannot be precluded that in principle Indonesia could be held responsible.\n\n55.\n\nHowever, it still remains to be determined whether PT Amco did at that juncture lose, de facto or otherwise, its right to a share of the profits.\n\n56.\n\nThere has been no evidence before the Tribunal to indicate that PT Amco made a demand for its share of the profits during the period April-July 1980. However, the Tribunal was informed by Indonesia (and it was not contested by Amco) that settling of the profit share would normally have occurred only on an annual basis. (See Previously Filed Documents, Vol.I, Tab.41.) It is the case that the Central Jakarta District Court, when ruling on May 28, 1980 on PT Wisma's claim for an interlocutory decree entitling it to manage the Hotel Kartika pending further legal proceedings, ordered that PT Wisma render a monthly account and justification of the management. (Indonesia Factual Appendix B, Tab.2). This order, while a normal protection in an interlocutory order where the final issues remain to be determined, necessarily envisaged the possibility that the Profit Sharing Agreement was still operational at that point.\n\n57.\n\nThe present controversy as to whether the events of April 1, 1980 impinged upon PT Amco\u2019s entitlement to participation in the profits occurred against a background described in the First Award as \"a kind of Cold War\" (para. 104). Each side had taken certain actions and issued certain orders to try to secure its position. PT Amco kept its offices in the building until October 1980 (for details of these various actions and events, see First Award, paras.102-109). It was suggested to the Tribunal that meetings were in fact continuing throughout this period between PT Amco and PT Wisma, though there is no evidence that anything was discussed at such meetings save PT Wisma's demands for the full implementation of the transfer of management.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that although PT Amco was prevented from exercising its right to management and control due to the events of March 31-April 1 1980, it has not been shown that at this time it also lost its entitlement to its share of profits.\n\n59.\n\nManagement rights are generally considered in the hotel industry to be a valuable and sought-after commodity. No quantification for this loss per, se has been offered by PT Amco. Two issues have arisen, however, in relation to loss of management rights. First, the Tribunal must consider whether the taking of PT Amco\u2019s management rights caused a level of profits to be reached under PT Wisma that was less than it would otherwise have been. It was suggested by Indonesia in oral argument that the profit levels secured under PT Wisma management were in fact higher than those secured in the period under PT Amco management. Be that as it may, it cannot be shown what PT Amco might have achieved, had it continued to manage, compared with the profit levels that were actually achieved under FT Amco's management. This comparison is necessarily hypothetical. No figures were directed by PT Amco to the Tribunal on this point, nor was any specific portion of the US$15,000,000 claimed said to be attributable to this element of loss.\n\n60.\n\nAmco further claimed that the undoubted loss of its rights of management and control also entailed loss of access to the daily cash flow of the hotel. This loss too was not quantified by Amco, but the access to the cash flow was said to be commercially valuable in the property investment business. For its part, Indonesia noted that nothing in the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.4) gave any specific contract right to PT Amco for access to the cash flow. Indonesia further contended that, whereas Amco might have lost control over the daily cash flow, such right was in any event fiduciary in nature, with Amco being accountable for any surplus over hotel needs, and any interest thereon. This surplus and interest would be part of the profits to be shared under the 1978 Agreement, being part of the Net Income referred to in paragraph 3 thereof.\n\n61.\n\nIt is res judicata that access to the cash flow was lost to Amco by virtue of the actions of the army and police (First Award, para.257, first sentence). The First Tribunal did not, however, attempt to address the character of this loss. Even though Amco's entitlement to the cash flow appears to have been as a matter of practice, rather than as any express contract right, such access would be a normal incidence of management. No evidence was put before this Tribunal as to practice between the parties in relation to the exercise of this access to the cash flow. Amco's access to the cash flow appears, however, to have been accepted by both parties. The Tribunal believes that control of the daily cash flow was fiduciary in nature. Amco's entitlement was to make disbursements from the cash flow for the necessary expenditures of the hotel. Insofar as any balance was interest bearing, that interest was for the benefit of both parties. No damages can therefore be awarded for the loss of access to the cash flow.\n\n62.\n\nNone of the above is to be taken as condoning by the Tribunal of military intervention as a method unilaterally to resolve disputes concerning foreign investment. If it was desired to remove Amco from management, appropriate Indonesian legal procedures existed to examine this possibility. It is not sufficient to have had recourse to these procedures for related, but different, legal purposes after the physical loss of management control by reason of the army and police action. The Tribunal's task, however, has been to identify the precise prejudice caused by these undoubtedly unlawful acts.\n\n63.\n\nWhile its analysis does not lead to the award of damages for the aspects of military intervention thus far examined, a further matter remains. The loss of the right to manage entailed a general disturbance caused to Amco. Some details of this disturbance are recalled at paras.101-108 of the First Award; and this consequence of the de facto loss of the right to manage on April 1 was also referred to in oral argument. The Tribunal finds that such harm was caused as a result of the illegal police and army intervention, and continued at least until Amco's licence was revoked on July 9, 1990. A sum of damages will be awarded.\n\nVI. THE BKPM REVOCATION OF PT AMCO'S LICENCE\n--------------------------------------------\n\n(a) The so-called \"single limb\" argument\n----------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nAmco claimed that the revocation was not substantively justified because one of the grounds on which it was said to be based has been held invalid by the First Tribunal. It argued that a decision unable to rely on that struck-down ground was necessarily invalid.\n\n65.\n\nThe BKPM revocation decision (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.63) contains several recitals of fact, and two clauses that may properly be said to be recitals of law which state reasons for the decision to revoke. One such reason was the clause rehearsing Amco's failure to invest the required sum of foreign capital. The other was\n\n\"2. that based on the Sub Lease Agreement dated October 15 1969 jo [sic] October 13, 1970, P.T. Amco Indonesia (Lessor) delivered the management of Hotel Kartika Plaza to P.T. Aeropacific Hotel Corp. (Lessee), therefore it is not P.T. Amco Indonesia which fulfilled the obligations as stipulated in the said Lease and Management contract...\"\n\nThe First Tribunal held (First Award, paras.206-219) that the assigning of the sublease was not a sufficient ground for revocation; and the present Tribunal has determined that finding to be res judicata (Decision on Jurisdiction, para.57).\n\n66.\n\nAmco contends that as these are not stated to be grounds in the alternative, the striking down of the validity of the one (the assignment of the sublease) leaves the other (insufficiency of investment) as inadequate to sustain, alone, the decision to revoke.\n\n67.\n\nThe matter is one of construction. The parties cited no authorities, whether of Indonesian or international law, to support their positions. Although the revocation decision does not, it is true, say that the two grounds are grounds in the alternative, it is equally true that it does not state that they are cumulative. Looked at as a whole, there is nothing in the wording or structure of the decision that leads one to suppose that the one ground is dependent on the other or insufficient without the other. More particularly, there is nothing in the wording or structure of the revocation decision that would entitle this Tribunal to conclude that BKPM would have been unable to revoke by reference to insufficiency of investment without also relying on the assignment of the lease.\n\n68.\n\nThis finding of construction is sustained by an examination of the relevant Indonesian legislation. Law No.1 of 1967 (Factual Appendix A to CounterMemorial, Tab.l) contains provisions on foreign capital investment that stand separately from other matters. The situation is not changed by the Announcement of the Foreign Exchange Bureau (BLLD) on July 25, 1967, elucidating Law No.1 of 1967 (Ibid., Tab.2). Paragraph 1 of this Announcement emphasises that in foreign capital investment the investor bears the risk. Decree No.63/1969 \"Regulations and Procedures for Exercising Control over Capital Investments\" (Ibid., Tab.3) simply provides for withdrawal of the licence \"if the capital investment plan is not implemented in accordance with the approval that has been granted\" ; there is no suggestion that an alleged insufficiency of investment would be an insufficient ground to cause such sanction, if it was not also coupled with, e.g., a failure by the investor to bear all the risk.\n\n69.\n\nWhether looked at from the perspective of the specific BKPM revocation order, or the underlying applicable Indonesian legislation, the BKPM decision could in principle be valid notwithstanding the striking down of the validity of the \"second limb\" of the decision.\n\nb) Procedural Irregularities and the BKPM Decision\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAmco's second cause of action lay in its claim that its licence had been wrongfully revoked, entitling it to full compensation therefor. There were many interrelated threads to this cause of action. The starting point was the finding of the first Tribunal that, as a matter of Indonesian law and of international law, the procedures leading to the deprivation of PT Amco's licence had violated due process. (First Award, paras.198, 201, 203.) The first Tribunal\u2019s finding that the procedure of the licence revocation was unlawful is res judicata. (Decision on Jurisdiction, para.48). This starting point was necessarily common to both parties. However, they made different arguments and drew different conclusions. Amco contended that the due process violation of itself entitled it to compensation and that this would be so even if -which PT Amco denied - the revocation decision of BKPM were substantively valid. Amco had contended in its first cause of action that damages lay for the army and police intervention on March 31-April 1, and that these damages should reflect a taking of the right to management and control, access to cash flow and PT Amco's inability to secure participation in the profits. Amco contended that the procedurally unlawful revocation of the licence was not only incapable of operating to \"cut off\" such damages running from April 1st, but was itself a further ground for the award of damages.\n\n71.\n\nIndonesia claimed that procedural violations did not per se give rise to damages, unless it could be shown that it was the very lack of due process that led to an unlawful substantive decision. Further, rather as Indonesia had contended that the events of March 31-April 1, while illegal, had caused no significant damage, so it was contended that the unlawful BKPM procedures occasioned no damage -partly because the revocation would in any event have occurred for proper substantive reasons, and partly because PT Amco was in fact afforded later opportunities to have the initial revocation decision revised.\n\n72.\n\nThis last argument comes close, as Amco pointed out, to a reopening of res judicata findings of procedural illegality. However, the Tribunal was prepared to countenance Indonesia's argument that there was new evidence which could be properly put before the Tribunal which, while it could not overturn a res judicata finding of procedural illegality, could still go to showing lack of damage arising therefrom. It was on that basis that the Tribunal was reminded that the Revocation Order itself (Indonesia Exh, Vol.II, Tab.63) contained the possibility of rectification in the face of error; and it was suggested that evidence showed that PT Amco sought to have the Revocation Order reviewed (ibid,. Vol.II, Tab.65 and Vol.VII, Tab.124). The Tribunal\u2019s attention was also drawn to certain documentation which was not before the first Tribunal, including representations made by Washington lawyers acting on behalf of Amco Asia to the Indonesian Embassy in Washington (Ibid., Vol.VII, Tab.112); representations made by Indonesian lawyers to the Chairman of BKPM (Ibid., Vol.VII, Tab.113); and to PT Wisma (ibid, Vol.VII, Tab. 124). It was put to the Tribunal that it was the inability of PT Amco to satisfy the licence criteria, rather than an inability to have BKPM reconsider matters, that caused any harm suffered by PT Amco.\n\n73.\n\nAmco contended that damages due as a result of the unlawful acts of the army and police of March 31/April 1, could not be \"cut off\" by a BKPM decision that was procedurally unlawful. Further, the fact that the BKPM decision was procedurally unlawful, itself gave rise to damages. As has been indicated, this Tribunal finds that the events of March 31-April 1, while unlawful, occasioned damages only in respect of disturbance to PT Amco. The significance of the question of whether a procedurally unlawful revocation of the licence by BKPM could operate to \"cut off\" the flow of damages thus in large part falls away. The other facet of the second Amco cause of action - namely, whether the violations of due process in the revocation of the licence per se entitle Amco to recover damages -remains for consideration. Amco contended that even were BKPM's decision substantively valid, damages would be due for the procedural violations.\n\n74.\n\nHowever, this last question, on which the Tribunal heard much interesting argument on Indonesian and on international law from both parties, is of practical importance only (given that Amco has offered no separate quantification for such head of damage) if BKPM\u2019s revocation is found to be substantively lawful. That issue will therefore be addressed next.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that the relevant issue is not whether (as Amco contends) procedural irregularities generate compensation, even if the substantive decision might be lawful; nor whether (as Indonesia contends) compensation is only due for procedural violations if these are themselves the cause of an unlawful substantive decision. Rather, the issue that must be determined is whether there exists a generally tainted background that necessarily renders a decision unlawful, even if substantive grounds may exist for such a decision. This background includes, but is not limited to, the question of procedural irregularities.\n\n76.\n\nIn early 1980 there existed serious disagreements between PT Amco and PT Wisma on a variety of matters, including the sums due to each party under the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement. By late March Colonel Soetjipto, the Chief Executive Officer of PT Wisma, Major Malonda, the Security Coordinator of the hotel, General Soerjo, a Director of PT Wisma, and others, were preparing for the takeover of control on March 31. (See First Award, para.91). The letter by which PT Wisma informed PT Amco that it was taking back control of the Wisma Kartika property dated March 31, 1980 (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.55), was in fact signed by General Soerjo on March 28, 1980 (First Award, para.91). On March 31-April 1 1980 the army and police intervened and PT Amco, in spite of attempts to resecure its position (ibid, paras.98-108), effectively lost control of the management of Hotel Kartika. Some members of the armed forces remained in the hotel until October 1980 (Ibid, para.109). The intervention of the army and police and their presence are elements that cannot be ignored in the ensuing events.\n\n77.\n\nOn April 12 1980, General Soerjo, a director of PT Wisma and now Chairman of the PT Wisma-appointed Management Council of the Kartika Hotel, accompanied by Mr. Zoelkarnain Ali, a former employee of PT Amco who was now employed by PT Wisma, visited the offices of BKPM. The PT Wisma representatives alleged certain irregularities with Amco's investment in Indonesia (First Award, para.112). A second meeting was held later that day between PT Wisma (represented on this occasion by Mr. Zoelkarnain Ali and Mr. Azwar Karim) and Mr. Ridho Harun and Mr. Usman Mahmud for BKPM (Ibid, para.113). The meeting was followed by a letter of April 14, 1980, from PT Wisma to BKPM (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.57). Apparently there had been an earlier letter of April 11, but this was not placed before the First Tribunal (First Award, para.114) or before this Tribunal. The allegations ' in the April 14 letter were summarised by the First Tribunal thus (ibid, para.117):-\n\n\"... (a) PT Amco had failed to meet its investment obligations under the Investment Licence and the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement; (b) the accounting treatment in PT Amco's financial statements of the US$1,000,000 1969 ABN Loan was misleading insofar as it purported to represent 'fresh capital abroad' ; (c) payments for imported goods came from Indonesian operations and not from overseas funds; (d) significant sums were transferred abroad and 'never reported and without the knowledge' of Bank Indonesia, BKPM and PT Wisma; (e) PT Amco was 'unwilling to submit to PT Wisma its periodical reports concerning the proceeds of lease of rooms and shops' ; (f) goods imported by PT Amco from Hong Kong were inflated; (g) PT Amco in 1973 participated in a fictitious loan from Pan American, and treated same in PT Amco's books in such a way as 'to deceive the Government'; (h) certain payments by PT Amco to Yee On Hong, a Hong Kong company, were really payments of debts due by Pan American to Yee On Hong, and other allegations of a similar nature \u2014\"\n\n78.\n\nPT Wisma identified PT Amco's investment obligation by reference to the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement. That Agreement required \"up to\" $US4m to be invested, with US$3m as equity and US$lm in loans. PT Wisma's letter of April 14, 1980 states the obligation as $4m, omitting \"up to\". In any event, the correct sum to be invested by PT Amco is to be found in the official Investment Application and approval (infra, paras.4). The capital of PT Amco, as there set out, was to be US$3m, all of which \"represents foreign capital and was to be deposited stage by stage and may take the form of cash, capital goods or both.\" At the conclusion of the PT Wisma letter of April 14, 1980, there is a passing reference to capital investment relating to \"the capital structure which they had agreed with PT Wisma Kartika or what have been stated in PT Amco Indonesia's application to the Government\" (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.57, XII(1)). But no mention is made, here or elsewhere in the letter, of the different sum of US $3m set out in the Investment Application.\n\n79.\n\nA one hour meeting took place on April 13 1980 between representatives of BKPM and of PT Amco. (First Award, para.116; Washington Hearings, p.1230, December 22, 1983).\n\n80.\n\nThree days after the allegations were presented by PT Wisma to BKPM for the first time, and one day after receiving the detailed allegations in the April 14, 1980 letter and enclosures6 from PT Wisma, Mr. Usman of BKPM prepared a Summary for Mr. Ridho Harun on the matter (First Award, paras. 118 and 123; Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.58). The summary was sent to the Chairman of BKPM on April 26,1980 (ibid, Vol.II, Tab.59).\n\nThe totality of which have not been produced before this Tribunal.\n\n81.\n\nThere are many disturbing aspects about the preparation of this summary, all of which have been pointed out by the First Tribunal and not alleviated by any evidence that was put to this Tribunal. It is the PT Wisma position on the Lease and Management Contract and the Profit-Sharing Agreement that is taken as the starting point. The First Tribunal put it thus (First Award, paras.120-121):-\n\n\"120. Mr Usman then stated the \u2019problem' as he saw it: 'The management of Hotel Kartika Plaza Building was taken over by PT Wisma Kartika because PT AMCO INDONESIA did not meet the provisions in the Lease and Management Contract of the year 1968, and the Agreement of 1979 (sic) (although by this, Mr Usman was obviously referring to the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement), and also violations of Public Law'. Which 'Public Laws' were violated, Mr Usman at this point, did not say. He then went on to give a clarification of what took place in regard to the AMCO group's investment in Indonesia, basing himself entirely on 'the meeting with representatives of P.T. Wisma Kartika on the 12th day of April, 1980 at the office of BKPM' at which 'the occurrence of the above problem was explained... '. In his Summary Mr Usman did not say whether he spoke with/or visited Bank of Indonesia and/or the Indonesian tax authorities. His assessment of the facts, according to his report, was based solely on the April 12th, 1980 'meetings\u2019 with PT Wisma representatives. Furthermore, nothing was said about PT AMCO'S side of the story or about his meeting with the PT AMCO' representatives on April 13, 1980.\n\n\"121. Mr Usman concluded: 'Based on the above facts it can be concluded that PT AMCO INDONESIA has committed violations towards the administrative provisions of the capital investment (law) in the form of: 1 - did not fulfil the invest (ment) as had been agreed upon by the Government; 2\u00b0 - it has acknowledged a loan as equity; 3o - it did not send report(s) to Bank Indonesia concerning the transfer(s) abroad; 4o - within 5 years, it did not forward report(s) to BKPM on the realization of (its) capital investment; 5\u00b0 - it did not report on the execution of the Sub-Lease Agreement by PT AMCO INDONESIA to BKPM, and (in) this case it also means that PT AMCO INDONESIA did not manage the project by itself. Besides that, PT AMCO INDONESIA has also committed violations which have criminal characteristics in the form of: 1\u2019- committing tax manipulation in the sense it did not pay tax as it should as had been assessed; 2o - giving as guarantee the assets owned by the Hotel, for obtaining (a) loan, without the approval of the owner (PT Wisma Kartika).\"\n\n82.\n\nMr. Usman's Summary did not refer to the amount or schedule of payment with regard to the foreign capital obligations of Amco Asia (First Award, para.118). Rather than correctly summarising the amount that Amco Asia was required to invest, Mr. Usman, like PT Wisma, referred to the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement and repeated the (incorrect) sums specified in the letter of April 14, 1980 (Ibid. para.119; Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.57). Further, Mr. Usman, in reporting on PT Wisma's allegations, not only reached his conclusions at great speed but failed to visit the Bank of Indonesia for talks and thorough examination of relevant files (First Award, para.115; not refuted in evidence before this Tribunal). And although Mr. Usman testified to the First Tribunal that he visited the tax office (Ibid., para.115), no evidence placed before this Tribunal indicates that any meeting was held with customs officials regarding charges relevant to their responsibilities.\n\n83.\n\nThe manner in which Mr Usman prepared his Summary must be described as rushed, over-reliant on PT Wisma's characterisations, factually careless, and insufficiently based on detailed and independent verification with the authorities concerned. This is so whether or not any of the charges were in fact sustainable.\n\n84.\n\nThese shortcomings were not rectified by BKPM's handling of Mr Usman's Summary. Mr. Ridho, for whom Mr Usman prepared his summary, repeated Mr. Usman's statements in the brief memorandum that he sent to the Deputy Chairman of BKPM on May 10, 1980. He added, however, additional information on the US$lm. amount which BKPM regarded as a loan. (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.60). On May 12, 1980 the Chairman of BKPM wrote to the President of the Republic of Indonesia, requesting guidance as to whether approval would be given to a decision to terminate the licence. The First Tribunal has noted that this communication repeats inaccurate references to the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement, omits mention of Amco's investment obligations according to its investment licence, reiterates the findings of violations without any detailed evidence being presented, rather repeating \"allegations [that] were a combination of those contained in the Usman and Ridho Reports\" (First Award, para.126; and see Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.61).\n\n85.\n\nThe President of the Republic approved the revocation of PT Amco's investment licence on May 30, 1980. (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.63, para.6). A further meeting took place between BKPM and PT Amco on June 16, 1980 and correspondence ensued (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tabs.62 and 65). Representations were also made on July 3, 1980 by Washington lawyers to the Indonesian Embassy in Washington (Indonesia Exh., Vol.VII, Tab.112). On July 8, 1980, the Greater Jakarta Court granted PT Amco's application for the postponement of the implementation of the interlocutory decree ordered by the Central Jakarta District Court on May 28, 1980. On July 9, 1980 BKPM issued Decision No. 07/VII/PMA/1980 revoking the said licence (ibid, Tab.63). This Decision referred to failures of PT Amco under both the 1968 Lease and Management Contract and the Investment Licence, though BKPM had no authority to revoke by reason of alleged shortcomings under a private contract. The Revocation Decision also refers to the Lease and Management Contract and the Investment Licence in terms which suggest that the investment sums in each were identical. The reference to the Lease and Management Contract was not only inapposite, but incorrect. The Decision stated that PT Amco was required \"according to the Lease and Management Contract and its Foreign Capital Application\" to invest $4m, $3m as its own equity.\n\n86.\n\nMr. Usman's Summary states that \"based on the letter from Bank Indonesia dated 1st of October 1971, permanent registration of the entry of new capital was only amounted to $US983,992.65\". It was explained to the Tribunal (Counter-Memorial, p.76) that in April 1980 BKPM received PT Amco's balance sheet as of December 31, 1978, which had not previously been available; and that BKPM was now in a position to calculate that PT Amco had invested even less in equity capital, namely, $399,000.\n\n87.\n\nIndonesia contended in its Counter-Memorial, and during oral argument, that \"Under Indonesian law, the calculation of a foreign investment must be made by reference to Bank Indonesia regulations regarding registration, and the kinds of evidence the Bank requires\" and that if a foreign investor were to challenge the registration in an Indonesian Court, \"[t]he registration of capital by Bank Indonesia, therefore, is dispositive, absent a showing that the Bank did not respect its own regulations.\" (CounterMemorial, pp.70-71; supported by Opinion of Dr. Komar Kantaatmadja (\"the Komar Opinion\"), Legal App. Vol.I, Tab.B, pp.64-65. This was challenged in the Opinion of Mrs Winita Kusnander, (\"the Kusnander Opinion\"), New Legal Exhibits to Claimants' Reply, Tab.140, pp.19-21.)\n\n88.\n\nThe Tribunal is at this juncture not addressing the substantive correctness or otherwise of BKPM's decision, but rather the background to its decision and the climate in which it was made. In that context, the Tribunal observes that it is well established that registration of investment and its recognition as foreign capital is a matter for Bank Indonesia. Prior to 1971, this task was given to the Foreign Exchange Bureau (BLLD) (Fact. App. A to the Counter-Memorial, Tab.2) and then to the Bank of Indonesia for purposes of the administration of foreign capital in the framework of Law No.1 of 1967 (ibid, Tab.4). The Bank of Indonesia issued detailed directives for administering and reporting foreign capital investment (ibid, Tab.7). It also issued interpretative provisions on the implementation of foreign capital investment within the framework of the Law of 1967 (ibid, Tab.9). It is clear, especially from this last, that companies operating under the Law of 1967 are required to notify the Bank of Indonesia about the capital they have invested. The Bank grants temporary registration based on the quarterly report from the company concerned, and permanent registration after examination:\n\n\"The said examination among others is concerning the proper prices of goods/services, either in regard to payment of share capital or as implementation of foreign loan in the framework of fulfilling the intended investment concerned, and to conform with the Financial Statement and Summary on Foreign Capital examined/verified by registered a Accountant Office (sic).\n\n\"This registration is performed with the obligation to submit the financial report with the realisation of the capital investment within the framework of PMA [Foreign Capital Investment] to Bank Indonesia...\" (ibid,. Tab.9, para.2B).\n\n89.\n\nThis central role of Bank Indonesia, clearly envisaged in the relevant decrees and instruments, was confirmed in oral evidence. Ms. S. Pellaupessy of Bank Indonesia told the Tribunal that it was for the Bank of Indonesia to see that a licence obligation is met, and that it was a duty against the background of the terms of the licence. An account had to be opened with Bank Indonesia, precisely so that the Bank could monitor compliance. Dr. Noer of BKPM affirmed that, where compliance with the licence was under scrutiny, there would be reliance on the Bank of Indonesia. He further confirmed that in the only other case where a licence had been revoked for a failure to make the specified investment of foreign capital (Indonesia Exh., Vol.VI, Tab.99, No.10), the figures produced by Bank Indonesia were relied upon. Mrs. Kusnander suggests in her Opinion that in the legal proceedings the Court was prepared to rely on BKPM\u2019s figures rather than the Bank of Indonesia\u2019s. In the interlocutory judgment (Previously Filed Claimants' Documents, Volume I, Tab.22) no reference was made to the BKPM figure. In the judgment of the Jakarta Court (ibid, Tab.27), referred to by Mrs. Kusnander, the issue before the Court was, however, whether PT Amco had defaulted on its contract with PT Wisma, and not whether PT Amco had made the necessary foreign capital investments. PT Wisma thus claimed that PT Amco was obligated to pay \"capital amounting to US$4,000,000\" and had only \"paid-in an amount of US$1,399,000\". The Court agreed, rejecting PT Amco's figures. However, as the case was not concerned with foreign capital investment, the Court was never put in the position of having to choose between the Bank's figure of US$983,992.65 and BKPM's figure of US$399,000.\n\n90.\n\nIt is clear to the Tribunal, in any event, that the disparity between the Bank's figures and those of BKPM was due to the fact that the former represented capital of foreign origin; while the latter represented equity capital shown in the 1978 audited accounts (received by BKPM in 1980), less US$1m which BKPM regarded as a loan improperly disguised as equity. While BKPM was surely entitled to make use of audited figures, these figures could not of themselves reveal what was capital of foreign origin. It would have been expected that the figures be passed to Bank Indonesia whose central role in the verification of foreign capital is clear. BKPM could perhaps have taken the view that the evidence in the 1978 accounts of shortfall of equity investment was so clear that there was no need to refer to the Bank for guidance as to the foreign capital element. But the fact remains that BKPM relied on 1978 figures, rather than ask the Bank for any further information it might have in 1980.\n\nc) The Information Known to BKPM at the Time of its Decision\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nIn its written complaint of April 14, 1980 to BKPM, PT Wisma made various allegations about matters other than PT Amco's stated failure to meet its investment obligations. These included allegations of failure to make investment reports; of misleading accounting treatment of the US$1,000,000 1965 ABN loan; unreported transfer of sums abroad; inflation of prices indicated for goods imported by PT Amco from Hong Kong; and participation by PT Amco in 1973 in a fictitious loan from' Pan American, which was then misleadingly presented in PT Amco\u2019s books. (See below, para.111).\n\n92.\n\nThese matters were repeated, in the form of findings adverse to PT Amco, by Mr Usman in the report that he prepared for BKPM. (See above, para.81); and were repeated in further memoranda of BKPM, including the request to the President of the Republic for approval of a decision to terminate the investment licence. (See above, para.84). The violations of legal obligation said to entitle revocation (other than shortfall of investment) are elaborated in the Counter-Memorial, pp.87-92. Indonesia contended before the Tribunal that even if there had not been sufficient grounds for revocation by virtue of the investment shortfall, these other grounds would have entitled BKPM to terminate the licence.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal heard testimony from Mr. N. Hanafi that the tax authorities became aware that the loan from Pan American was fictitious only when they discovered that there was, despite PT Amco\u2019s previous denials, a set of audited accounts for 1973. Mr. Hanafi told the Tribunal that neither he nor any other responsible officer of BKPM saw the 1973 audited accounts \"before it became a case\". He also informed the Tribunal that he did not know of any required second 'deficiency letter' being sent for 1973, or for any year, and that he did not check the records of payments kept in the collection section.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the evidence placed before it at oral hearings in Washington (which appeared to have been processed after 1980) tended to indicate that sums in tax were still due for the period 1974 to 1977. This fact was characterised by Mr. Usman, and by the BKPM letter to the President, as \"tax manipulation\" (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.58, para.5; and ibid, Tab.60), notwithstanding that no case for recovery of tax under Indonesian law had been brought against PT Amco by the date of the revocation of the licence.\n\n95.\n\nSo far as the allegations concerning inflating of import prices were concerned, the Tribunal heard from Mr. E. Abdurrachman about documents entitled \"Acknowledgement of Clearance for Use\", which, when presented by the importer or his agent, and finally signed by the Chief of the Customs Section at the port, becomes authority for the release of the goods (\"PPUD\"). Mr. Abdurrachman informed the Tribunal that he had been unable to find PT Amco\u2019s documents, to review them, among the general filing held at the port of entry.\n\n96.\n\nNeither tax manipulation nor import irregularities were in the event relied on when BKPM drew up its formal revocation decision. (Ibid, Tab.63)\n\n97.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal cannot but note that in a letter of September 22, 1980, BKPM wrote to the Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, to inform him about events concerning PT Amco and PT Wisma, and told him \"the take over of the management of Hotel Kartika Plaza by PT Wisma Kartika was performed without the involvement or assistance of the Indonesian Army\". (Indonesia Exh., Vol.VII, Tab.120, at para.9).\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the whole approach to the issue of revocation of the licence was tainted by bad faith, reflected in events and procedures.\n\n99.\n\nAt this juncture the Tribunal wishes to observe that while it has for the First Tribunal been relatively straightforward to perceive Indonesia as the wrongdoer, and Amco as the aggrieved party, to the present Tribunal matters in 1990 are less black and white. That Indonesia acted unlawfully through the police and army action is undeniable. But the evidence also reflects discreditably on Amco. Amco submitted apparently false statements concerning the availability of audited accounts for certain years. Accounts submitted to the tax authorities contained deductions for interest on a loan never entered into.\n\n100.\n\nAmco's obligation to invest foreign capital was established by the Minister of Public Works' final approval of Amco's investment application given on July 29, 1969 (Indonesia Exh. 8, Vol., Tab.8). In the approval the Minister gave \"permission to Amco Asia Corp, to establish P.T. Amco Indonesia in Jakarta, in accordance with its letter of request to the Foreign Capital Investment Technical Team\". The letter of request referred to in the Minister's decision is Amco Asia's application of May 6, 1968 to establish PT Amco Indonesia (Amco Exh., Previously Filed Claimants Documents, Vol.I, Tab.5 and Indonesia Exh., Vol.I, Tab.4) as amended by Amco Asia's letter of May 13, 1969 to the Foreign Capital Investment Technical Team (Ibid., Tab.5).\n\n101.\n\nIn the application Amco Asia undertook to invest its own assets in PT Amco Indonesia so that PT Amco Indonesia's share capital would amount to US$3m, divided into 30,000 shares with a nominal value of US$100 per share. All of the company equity was to be foreign equity. The application also provided that capital would be deposited in stages and could be in the form of cash, capital goods, or both. The application indicated that a deposit schedule and deposit form was attached. These documents have not been produced by the parties.\n\n102.\n\nThe investment application shows that the equity investment was not to be made at one time, but could be made over a period of time. Due to lack of evidence, it is not possible firmly to establish within what time period the equity investment was to be made. Indonesia's position has not been consistent in the matter (Indonesia's CounterMemorial, at footnote 253 states \"It continues to be Indonesia's position that the investment had to be satisfied at the latest by 1972 to coincide with the scheduled completion of the hotel\". But footnote 295 says that it is res judicata that the Amco Group had ten years until the end of 1978 to complete their investment. And Mr. Noer of BKPM told the Tribunal that it was still open to Amco to meet any shortfall even up to June 1980).\n\n103.\n\nPT Wisma's letter of April 14, 1980 to BKPM (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.57) contains a reference to the now missing document schedule annexed to Amco's investment application. According to PT Wisma the deposit schedule states that the entire capital shall be remitted to Indonesia at the latest within four years. PT Wisma does not state from what time the period starts to run. The time period stipulated in the Lease and Management Agreement of 1968 was approximately five years from the authorities' approval of Amco's investment application.\n\n104.\n\nThe construction of the hotel was completed in late 1971/early 1972 (First Award, para.74).\n\n105.\n\nDuring the period from 1968 to 1971 Amco applied to Bank Indonesia for the registration of a total of US$2,156,559.13 in foreign investment. As of October 1, 1971 Bank Indonesia had permanently registered only an amount of US$983,992.65. Bank Indonesia's refusal to make permanent registration was in part due to lack of sufficient documentation for the actual value of imported goods. Amco's request in 1971 for registration of certain assets as reinvested profits was denied by Bank Indonesia because the amounts did not constitute reinvested profits under the Foreign Investment Law. In a letter dated November 23, 1972 Bank Indonesia requested Amco to report on the realisation of the capital investment (Indonesia Exh., Vol.I, Tab.29). It would seem that Amco did not reply to this letter from Bank Indonesia and apparently Bank Indonesia let nearly three years pass without taking any action. With reference to the November 23, 1972 letter, Bank Indonesia requested in a letter of October 29, 1975 that Amco submit the reports as soon as possible. A copy of the letter was sent to BKPM (Indonesia Exh., Ibid.,Tab.30).\n\n106.\n\nOn January 10, 1976, BKPM wrote to Amco requesting it to submit various reports to Bank Indonesia and to file an investment report with BKPM (Indonesia Exh. Ibid., Tab.31). In a letter dated August 10, 1977 Bank Indonesia requested PT Amco to forward financial statements verified by a certified public accountant to enable Bank Indonesia to consider permanent registration of the foreign investment. Additional requests from Bank Indonesia to PT Amco for documents were made on February 27, 1978 (Indonesia Exh., ibid., Tab.35), May 31, 1978 (Ibid., Tab. 36) and September 3, 1979 (Ibid., Tab.37).\n\n107.\n\nBank Indonesia's request to PT Amco to forward its audited financial statements was apparently never met by the company. (The Tribunal notes that PT Amco claims that certain of its documents had been seized during the army and police action (First Award, para.104). In a statement dated December 5, 1979, signed by Mr. E.M. Tomodok, Vice-Chairman of PT Amco, PT Amco represented that its financial reports for the years 1974 until 1977 had never been audited (Indonesia Exh., Vol.I, Tab.39). This statement by Amco appears to be false. Before this Tribunal the Republic of Indonesia produced 1977 audited accounts for PT Amco. The 1977 audited accounts had been sent on March 27, 1978 by the public accountants firm of Machjud Modofore to the Board of Directors of Amco (Indonesia Exh., Vol.III, Tab.125).\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal has no evidence that certified accounts of PT Amco for the 1974 financial year and subsequent years were given by PT Amco either to Bank Indonesia or to BKPM.\n\n109.\n\nOn January 1, 1973 Pan American and PT Amco Indonesia executed a document purporting to be a loan from Pan American to PT Amco Indonesia in the amount of Rp. 360m. The interest on the loan to be paid by PT Amco to Pan American was 8.8 per cent per year (Indonesia Exh., Vol.III, Tab.80).\n\n110.\n\nPT Amco's unaudited accounts for 1973 (Indonesia Exh., Vol.III, Tab.75) used for its tax assessment, contain an expense item named \"service rate etc.\" amounting to Rp. 32,4000,000.00, a sum close to 8.8 per cent of the purported loan from Pan American to Amco. The unaudited 1973 accounts also contain an amount of Rp. 362,194,889.00 named long range debt. The 1973 audited accounts do not contain similar amounts (Indonesia Exh., Vol.Ill, Tab.77). The 1973 audited accounts were apparently not submitted to the tax authorities.\n\n111.\n\nOn September 20, 1989 in the afternoon session Mr. Nono Hanafi being questioned by Mr. Badini testified that he had learned from the transcripts from the hearings of the First Tribunal that Mr. Tan had \"denied\" the existence of said loan. Mr. Rand intervened to state that \"we are quite willing to stipulate that such loan was never made\".\n\n112.\n\nWhile PT Amco's behaviour contained discreditable features, that fact could not justify BKPM's approach to the question of revocation.\n\nd) The Application of the Law to These Findings\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal must now consider the legal consequences of its findings. To do this it is necessary to turn first to Indonesian law, and then to international law.\n\n114.\n\nThe Indonesian law adduced by Amco was in support of the proposition that \"Under Indonesian Law, a procedurally unlawful administrative act is void\". (Memorial, p.28). It was also claimed that \"Under Indonesian law, due process violations are compensable per se\" (Reply, p.14). The position was claimed to be the same under international law. Both these related claims were advanced in oral argument. Indonesia argued that under both Indonesian and international law, an unlawful procedure \"cannot alone support an award of compensation in this case. This is because of the inseparability of the procedural aspects and the substantive basis for the revocation.\" (CounterMemorial, p.123). The issue of \"compensability per se\" was treated interchangeably with the question of validity of procedurally unlawful acts (see, e.g., Counter-Memorial, p.124). In Indonesia's view, a procedurally unlawful act would be valid, and would give rise to no compensation, unless the \"procedural defect is integrally related with the substantive right such that compliance with the procedure is a necessary condition to the exercise of the substantive right\". (Komar First Opinion, Legal App. to Counter-Memorial, Tab.B, p.52).\n\n115.\n\nDr. Komar, in his First Legal Opinion, opined that BKPM's right to revoke, being based on presidential decree, existed independently of required procedural formalities. He further contended that the revocation was caused by PT Amco's repeated failure to fulfil its obligations, and was not a necessary consequence of the procedural defects. Dr. Komar also wrote that under Indonesian law the validity of an administrative act is tested by reference to \"substantial justice\" (Ibid, p.42). In both the written pleadings and oral argument, Indonesia introduced evidence directed to show that, while it was res judicata that Amco had not been afforded due process, it had not, in the overall picture, been denied \"substantial justice\".\n\n116.\n\nMrs. Kusnander offered a Legal Opinion which rejected as incorrect Dr. Komar's analysis of Indonesian law (Claimant's New Legal Documents, Tab.140). A second Opinion was provided by Dr. Komar (Legal App. to the Counter-Memorial, Vol.VIII, Tab.RRR). These Opinions provide helpful analyses of Indonesian law generally, going beyond the immediate point in issue, and have been carefully studied by the Tribunal, along with the cases and authorities to which it has been referred, and on which it was addressed by counsel for both sides in oral argument.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that most of the Indonesian cases cited by Amco are irrelevant as to its claim (that procedurally unlawful administrative acts are void, and give rise to compensation) ; and to the issue that the Tribunal believes must here be determined (whether a generally tainted background necessarily renders a decision unlawful, even if substantive grounds may exist for such a decision). Thus the case of Yayasan Tjie On Jie Jan (64/Perd. 1971/PT/-Mdn., of 1973, New Legal Exhibits to Claimants' Memorial, Tab.103), concerned wrongful procedure in the sense of absence of jurisdiction, which want of jurisdiction necessarily led to a revocation of the decision and to compensation. Although there is some reference at the outset to it having been proved that \"the form of cancellation is illegal because it did not follow legal procedure\", nothing in the facts shows this as constituting a separate head. Rather, it was because of the absence of jurisdiction that the form of cancellation was illegal-. The case of Soekartin v. Indonesia. (No.772/1970-G. herregistrasei No.530/1961-G of 1972, (Ibid., Tab.107), concerns unlawful arrest, detention and the sale of property, with the appropriate legal consequences being drawn. It is neither authority for the claim as formulated by Amco nor of assistance in resolving the issue as formulated by the Tribunal. In the case of John Kong Sene v. Head of Kabupaten et al. (ibid, Tab.108), the administrative acts of the defendants were declared void as they were taken under the wrong section of the relevant Decree. The case provides no guidance on the legal effects of lack of due process, still less on the legal consequences of a generally tainted environment in which the administrative decision operates. And the extract with which the Tribunal was provided from R.M. Suryodinigrat, S.H., Perikatan-Perikatan Bersumber Undang-Undang (1980) (ibid, Tab.118) is unilluminating.\n\n118.\n\nOne case was more relevant. In P.T. Savoy Homan Hotel. (No.353/1979/C/Bdg. of 1980, Ibid, Tab.116) there was both a decision taken by an improperly constituted Committee and an omission to make the necessary request of the Government (and thus a failure of jurisdiction) and also a failure of due process due to the absence of the plaintiff. All grounds are equally relied on in annulling the decision and ordering restitution. To the extent that one could speculate that the same decision would have been reached even if the Committee had been properly constituted, and a request to the Government had been made, so long as the plaintiff was not present at the proceedings, this case may show that a failure of due process may lead to annulment. But this is necessarily hypothetical.\n\n119.\n\nThe attention of the Tribunal was also drawn to the treatise by Prajudi Armosudirajo, Hukum Administrasi Negara (Ibid, Tab.117). The author states that a civil judge can declare an administrative directive wrongful not only if it was taken arbitrarily, or without following the law, or without authority, but if it was taken \"by misusing authority\". The author cites no specific authority for this view, though reference is made to Article 1365 of the Civil Code (which is in much more general terms).7 The author addresses only what may be done by a civil judge and does not state that the act is automatically void.\n\nFor text, see para.170 infra.\n\n120.\n\nTwo other cases were drawn to the attention of the Tribunal in the Opinion on Indonesian law prepared by Dr. Komar: the Josopandojo Case. Decision of the Supreme Court, March 3, 1971; and the Eddy Hans Case. Decision of the Supreme Court, November 11, 1976; (Legal Appendices to the Counter-Memorial, Vol.I, Tab.3, pp.43-45). Mrs. Kusnander offered her observations to the Tribunal on these cases. (New Legal Exhibits to Claimants Reply, Tab.140). Dr. Komar provided a second opinion (Legal Appendices to the Counter-Memorial, Vol.VIII, Tab.RRR). It is clear that, on the one hand, in the Josopandojo case it was found that no tort had been committed; while on the other hand the test for ascertaining a tort by a public authority is by reference to \"the Laws and Regulations\" and also, as a separate head \"kepatutan dalam masvarakat\". (Text and translation provided to the Tribunal, p.10). This phrase was interpreted by Dr. Komar as 'reasonableness (or 'propriety') in society' and by Mrs. Kusnander as 'standards of fairness within society'. In the view of the Tribunal nothing turns on this different terminology. The Eddy Hans Case does not carry matters forward, as the claim that a decision was taken on the basis of a \"one sided report\" of a public authority, made \"without hearing, summoning and investigating\" (text and translation provided to the Tribunal, p.2) was rejected by the Supreme Court, apparently simply on the grounds that the High Court was competent to affirm the District Court\u2019s decision if it thought it correct. It would seem that the Supreme Court did not regard itself as competent to review the argument of \"onesidedness\" (Ibid, p.8).\n\n121.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Indonesian law does not clearly stipulate whether a procedurally unlawful act per se generates compensation; or whether a decision tainted by bad faith is necessarily unlawful. There is, however, some slight authority for the view that these last two questions might be answered in the affirmative under Indonesian law. (See paras.118 and 119 above).\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the international law authorities relied on by the parties. The writings of Dr. F.A. Mann, Professor D. O'Connell, Professor A. Freeman and Professor Borchard, while always profitable to read, are not in the view of the Tribunal directed to the issues in this case. Dr. Mann (\"The Consequences of an International Wrong in International Law\", 48 BYIL (1976-7), New Legal Exhibit to Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Tab. 109)\u201a is writing generally on the consequences of illegality, but not on the specific question of whether a procedurally unlawful act, or a tainted background to a decision, necessarily generates damages and/or invalidates the substantive decision. The cases analysed by Dr. Mann, at the pages cited in Amco's Memorial, p.30, are clearly relevant to the question of the consequences of substantive illegality in international law. (New Legal Exhibits to Claimants' Memorial, Tab.109). The extracts from Professor O'Connell (International Law. Vol.II, at Ibid., Tab.110) are likewise inapposite. Professor Freeman, (The International Responsibility of States for Denial of Justice. 1970, at Ibid,. Tab.111) refers in the passages cited by Amco, Memorial, p.43, to the Martini Case and states that an arbitral tribunal may annul certain obligations imposed on a foreigner by a local decision which violates international law; or more usually monetary reparation will be awarded. This does not address the problem before this Tribunal. Nor does his analysis of the Fabiani Case, in which the procedural delays led to tangible financial losses. The case shows only that if the unjust procedure is the cause of the loss, damages will follow; but it does not address the converse, namely, whether damages are available for unjust procedure that is not shown to be the cause of loss. The extracts from Borchard, (The Diplomatic Protection of Citizens Abroad. 1915, at Ibid., Tab.114) are cited in the Memorial, pp.53-4, 130, for the proposition that acts in violation of international law will not be given effect. Professor Borchard, clearly writing of French administrative law, merely says that to have an illegal administrative act annulled, it is necessary to have recourse to the courts.\n\n123.\n\nThe Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens (Ibid., Tab.121) - of doubtful weight as persuasive authority of international law - contains in Article 30 wording which is clearly too broad to be a correct statement of international legal principle. And the Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, s.712 and Comments, (ibid, Tab.122), is equally undirected to the issue before the Tribunal.\n\n124.\n\nSome of the case law put before the Tribunal equally lacks focus on the issues in these proceedings. Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Farr. (383 Fed.Rep. 2d Series, Ibid., Tab.113) turns on the application of the Hickenlooper Amendment8 and is thus doubtful authority for the proposition that \"acts in violation of international law will not be given effect\" (Memorial, p.30), even were that a correct formulation of the issue before the Tribunal. The case of McCurdy v. The United Mexican States. US-Mexico Claims Commission, 1929 (Legal App. to the Counter-Memorial, Vol.IV, Tab.JJ) indicates only that some irregularities in proceedings will not necessarily constitute a denial of justice.\n\ni.e. an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1965.\n\n125.\n\nIndonesia, in its written and oral pleadings, and Professor D.W. Bowett QC, who prepared a legal opinion (Legal App. to the Counter-Memorial, Vol.VIII, Tab.TTT), relied on certain cases of the European Court on Human Rights to contend that procedural violations do not generate damages where there remains the possibility that the substantive decision might be the same. In the Sramek Case. 1984, (Ibid., Tab.UUU) an application was brought against Austria for violation of Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which requires that in the determination of one\u2019s civil rights and obligations or of a criminal charge, \"everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law\". It was found that in the circumstances of the case, there was a violation of Article 6(1) (the tribunal having included a person \"in a subordinate position, in terms of his duties and the organisation of his service, vis-avis one of the parties\": Judgment, para.42). The Court refused, however, the claim of the applicant for pecuniary loss.\n\n126.\n\nIt is true that the European Court said that \"the evidence in the file does not warrant the conclusion that had it been differently composed [the tribunal] would have arrived at a decision in Mrs. Sramek's favour\". It is against that background that Indonesia argues that no compensation was paid for a procedural violation, where there existed the possibility that the same outcome might have occurred even had there been no procedural violation.\n\n127.\n\nThe present Tribunal makes the following observations. First, cases under the European Convention on Human Rights deal with compensation not as a matter of general international law, but by reference to the specific treaty requirements of Article 50 of the Convention, which requires \"just satisfaction\" to be given by the Court if the local law allows of only partial reparation. Mrs. Sramek's claim before the Austrian courts had been not for compensation for the procedural wrong (which in any event was a substantive wrong under the terms of the European Convention, i.e. procedural guarantees of fair trial are a substantive treaty right) but rather for consequential pecuniary loss. This she had failed to prove - and the European Court, not being an Austrian Court of Appeal, could not override the Austrian Court and award compensation on this basis. The Tribunal therefore finds that the Sramek Case does not support Indonesia's claim.\n\n128.\n\nThe same underlying considerations apply to other European Convention cases cited by Professor Bowett in his Opinion (Legal App. to the Counter-Memorial, Vol.VII, Tab.TTT). The Golder Case. ECHR, Ser.A. 1975, is an indication that not every violation (procedural or substantive) entitles an award of \"just satisfaction\" under Article 50. But that does not bear upon the present problem. Equally, all that one may reasonably deduce from the European Court of Justice (EEC) case of Bayerische HNL Vermehrunqsbetriebe GmbH and Co., 1978 E.Ct. Justice 1209, is that not all losses sustained in the face of government economic policy entail compensation. That is a far cry from the present issue. And as Professor Bowett himself notes, in the other European Convention of Human Rights case which he cites, Engel. ECHR Ser.A 1977, no claim was made for compensation for material damage. There is a discrete jurisprudence relating to Article 50 of the European Convention that has no applicability to the issue in this case.\n\n129.\n\nThe de Sabla Case. US-Panama General Claims Arbitration 1934 (New Legal Exhibits to Claimants' Memorial, Tab.120), relied on by Amco, concerned grants by Panama to third parties over de Sabla's land. The Commission found that inadequate possibility was given to de Sabla for opposition to such grants. Damages were assessed, but these cannot be said to represent compensation for procedural violations, which the Commission found to have occurred without bad faith or discrimination. Rather, damages were based on the fact that the procedures resulted in the loss of property. This would thus seem to be another case where procedure and substance are inextricably intertwined.\n\n130.\n\nThree further cases cited by Amco remain for consideration. The first of these is the Idler Case U.S. v. Venezuela, 1898 (New Legal Exhibits to Claimants' Memorial, Tab.112). Idler was a United States citizen, who contracted with agents acting for Venezuela, for the provision of military equipment. Certain invoices for very large sums remained substantially unpaid. After the Union of Venezuela and New Grenada in 1819-1821, arguments occurred as to whether it was the new Republic of Colombia that was liable for the debt, or the \"Department of Venezuela\". Without here entering into the very complicated history of Idler's attempts to recover the sums owed, we note that judgment was eventually entered for Idler, but the Treasury refused to pay, contesting the jurisdiction of the court concerned. This question, too, was decided by the Venezuela Supreme Court in favour of Idler. Still unable to secure payment. Idler returned to the United States where he sought diplomatic support for his claim. In 1836 the Venezuelan Government applied to the Supreme Court for an order to annul the judgment. This followed two years\u2019 of written submissions by the Government to the Supreme Court, of which Idler was never notified. Idler was instructed by the Court to appear before it, but learned of this only twelve days before the commencement of proceedings, when it was impossible to get to Venezuela in time. The Supreme Court found it had no jurisdiction to annul the earlier judgments in favour of Idler, and that the action should have been brought in front of the same judge who had given the original judgment. The matter then reverted to the Superior Court of Caracas, which did set aside the judgment in favour of Idler, and indeed condemned him to pay \"judicial ta\"x and a portion of the costs. This was in turn affirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\n131.\n\nIn the international arbitral proceedings brought by the United States against Venezuela, the arbitral commission stated that one of the key questions was whether the general effect of the proceedings of 1836-1839 constituted a denial of justice. Idler received no notification of the proceedings in the lower court, but rather, a notification to appear in the Supreme Court in a suit instituted there; and the Commission took the view that, as it was the lower court that alone had jurisdiction, to summon him before one tribunal, when the business affecting his interests was to be done in another, was misleading. Further, the Commission stated that, even if no notification had been required, a notification of the sort given would be misleading. \"... [W]e are inclined to think the act, from the standpoint of justice, would vitiate the whole proceedings\". (Tab.112 at internal page 3515). The Commission, emphasising that a foreign citizen before the courts of a sovereign was entitled only to \"ordinary justice\", found that Idler did not get it and that therefore the proceedings against him were \"a nullity\" (ibid, 3517). The Commission did not consider whether, on substantive grounds, the decisions annulling the earlier judgments might not have been correct. Rather, it found that the denial of justice rendered them a nullity.\n\n132.\n\nThe second remaining case relied on by Amco was the Chattin Case. 1927 (Legal Exhibits to Claimants' Memorial, Tab.119; Legal App. to the Counter-Memorial, Tab.KK). This arbitration between the United States and Mexico also concerned irregularities in judicial proceedings in criminal proceedings. Acts of the judiciary, in the view of presiding Commissioner Van Vollenhoven, alone could constitute a denial of justice, executive and legislative wrongs always being subject to judicial redress. Such judicial acts would only amount to a denial of justice if they constituted \"an outrage, bad faith, wilful neglect of duty, or insufficiency of action apparent to any unbiased man\" (Legal Exh. to Claimant's Memorial, Tab.119, Internal p.287). Commissioner Van Vollenhoven found, on the facts of the case, that \"the whole of the proceedings discloses a most astonishing lack of seriousness on the part of the Court\" (ibid, p.292) and that the proceedings were unjust. It matters not that in his powerful dissent Commissioner MacGregor found that local law had not been violated, and doubted too, on his analysis of the facts, that international law had been violated, for in the present case the finding of the First Tribunal that there had been procedural unlawfulness stands as res judicata.\n\n133.\n\nIt is relevant, too, that the Commission makes no supposition about the guilt or otherwise of Chattin - indeed, it was not prepared to make a finding of illegality of his arrest. Against the background of a denial of justice, damages were nonetheless awarded.\n\n134.\n\nFinally, in the Walter Fletcher Smith Case. 1929 (Previously Filed Claimants' Documents, Vol.II, Tab.0), an expropriation of a US citizen's property was found to be neither consistent with the constitutional requirements of Cuba nor with international law. Whereas the property could lawfully have been nationalised for a public purpose, it was found that the purpose was \"amusement and private profit\". The emphasis was not so much on the requirement of public international law that a taking of property be for \"public utility\" purposes, as on the good faith aspect:\n\n\"From a careful examination of the testimony and of the records, the Arbitrator is impressed that the attempted expropriation of the claimant's property was not in compliance with the constitution, nor with the laws of the Republic; that the expropriation proceedings were not, in good faith, for the purpose of public utility. They do not present the features of an orderly attempt by officers of the law to carry out a formal order of condemnation. The destruction of the claimant's property was wanton, riotous, oppressive. It was effected by about one hundred and fifty men whose action appears to have been of a most violent character. There is some evidence that, before the expropriation proceedings, certain persons, being unable to purchase the property from the claimant, threatened to destroy it...\" (ibid, Internal P.387).\n\n135.\n\nThe arbitration concluded that the property should be restored to the claimant. \"No reflection is to be made upon the character of the courts of Cuba... Under all the circumstances of the case it seems clear that the action of those tribunals should not be held to render valid the proceedings of attempted expropriation.\" (Ibid, p.387). An award of damages was made \"if the land is not to be restored\" (ibid).\n\n136.\n\nOne can see from these international cases that the question in international law is not whether procedural irregularities generate damages per se. Rather, the international law test is whether there has been a denial of justice. They show equally that not every procedural irregularity constitutes a denial of justice. To this effect, see also Opinion of Professor Bowett (Legal App. to the Counter-Memorial, Vol.VIII, Tab.TTT, at p.10). At the same time, as Commissioner Nielson reminded in the McCurdy Case (op.cit., supra. para.124, at Internal page 150) even if no single act constitutes a denial of justice, such denial of justice can result from \"a combination of improper acts\". In the recent case of Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (USA v. Italy), ICJ Reports, 1989, the International Court of Justice drew a distinction between unlawfulness in municipal law and arbitrariness under international law. The distinction it drew is, in the view of the Tribunal, equally germane to the distinction between procedural unlawfulness and a denial of justice. The Court stated that arbitrariness \"is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law\" (Ibid., para.128). The test, said the Court, was \"a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety\" (Ibid).\n\n137.\n\nIt thus is necessary to decide whether the procedural irregularities and other background factors in this case amounted to a denial of justice, that would taint the decision of BKPM, regardless of whether BKPM might have had substantive grounds for its action against Amco. The first question is whether it is correct, as Commissioner Van Vollenhoven contended in the Chattin Case, that acts of the judiciary alone can constitute a denial of justice. Most arbitral awards do not make this distinction in the context of denial of justice. While all those cases cited above happened to concern, at some phase, judicial decisions, the Tribunal sees no provision of international law that makes impossible a denial of justice by an administrative body. BKPM was an administrative, rather than a strictly judicial, body. It has not been argued to us by Indonesia that the acts of BKPM, taken in context, could not themselves constitute a wrong in international law, if unlawful, but that only a failure of the courts to rectify them could constitute such a wrong. And if one applies the test in the ELSI Case (\"a wilful disregard of due process of law\"); or in the Idler Case (the need for \"ordinary justice\"); or in the Chattin Case (\"bad faith, wilful neglect of duty, or insufficiency of action apparent to any unbiased man\") it can be seen that the BKPM handling of PT Wisma's complaint, which led in turn to the approval of the President of the Republic to the proposal for revocation, constituted a denial of justice.\n\n138.\n\nThere are thus indications, both as a matter of Indonesian and international law, that the circumstances surrounding BKPM's decision tainted the proceedings irrevocably.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that, although certain substantive grounds might have existed for the revocation of the licence, the circumstances surrounding BKPM's decision make it unlawful.\n\n140.\n\nThat being so, the Tribunal could at this point conclude its findings on liability. However, other claims have been advanced by the parties, and being mindful of the requirements of Article 48(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes, the Tribunal now deals with these.\n\n(e) Amco's request for an adverse inference\n-------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nIn a letter of July 25, 1989, Amco made a submission \"that an adverse inference should be drawn against Indonesia\" with respect to certain PT Amco documents seized during the army and police intervention of April 1, 1980, some of which, it was alleged, were never returned. This was advanced as a submission relating to PT Amco's difficulties in proving compliance with its investment obligation. The Tribunal, not having to address the issue of whether Amco fulfilled its investment obligation, need not decide whether certain such documents could have helped Amco or not in establishing its case in that regard.\n\n(f) The Lawfulness of BKPM's Decision by Reference to Grounds Other than Shortfall of Equity Investment\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nIndonesia argued that, even if the BKPM revocation were unlawful by reference to the ground of shortfall of equity investment and failure to import the required amount of foreign equity capital, it would still be lawful by reference to other grounds: failure to make investment reports to Bank Indonesia and BKPM; failure to report capital transfers to Bank Indonesia; and tax fraud (Counter-Memorial, pp.88-92; Reply, pp.16-17). Indonesia claimed that Indonesian law required the licence revocation to be considered in the light of the totality of the circumstances existing at the time, including the entire administrative record before BKPM (CounterMemorial, p.87). Amco replied that the revocation could be justified, if at all, only on the substantive grounds stated in the revocation decision. It denied that the Indonesian law requirement that an administrative act be evaluated in the light of the totality of circumstances meant that grounds not cited in a revocation decision may be used to determine whether such decree is substantively justifiable (Reply, p.25). Oral argument was addressed to the Tribunal on this point, together with evidence showing the various grounds on which BKPM was entitled to revoke investment licences, and actual past practice in this regard.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal, in dealing with this question, does not have to make findings of law because of its determination that BKPM\u2019s substantive decision was irrevocably tainted by bad faith. This necessarily means that, even were a decision on grounds other than those stated in the Decree in principle sustainable, they could no more be lawful than the decision made on grounds of shortfall of investment, because of the general background that pervaded the decision-making.\n\nVII. FURTHER CLAIMS AND ARGUMENTS\n---------------------------------\n\n(a) Estoppel\n------------\n\n144.\n\nTwo arguments of estoppel have arisen. Indonesia has claimed that Amco should be estopped from arguing before this Tribunal that they directly invested any amount higher than the sum they represented in the Jakarta court proceedings in 1986 that they had directly invested (Counter-Memorial, p.78). Amco contended that Indonesia never during the period 1968 to 1980 notified Amco that it was in danger of losing its licence due to underinvestment or non-registration of foreign equity capital, and that it should be estopped from relying on these matters as grounds for revocation (Memorial, pp.52-55).\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal doubts that the international law principle of estoppel would, on a proper understanding of the facts and examination of the evidence, be applicable in either of these cases. In any event, because the level of Amco's investment is not determinative of the issues as the Tribunal has formulated them in dealing with this question, it makes no formal findings of law on either of these claims.\n\n(b) Legal Effect of the Indonesian Supreme Court\u2019 Decision of April 30. 1985 on Amco's Entitlement to Damages\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nIndonesia claimed that the Supreme Court decision of April 30, 1985 cut off, as of January 12, 1982, Amco's right to compensation. The First Tribunal found that the lower court decisions did not operate to cut off any entitlement to damage (First Award, paras.259-263). This finding is res judicata. (Decision on Jurisdiction, para.53). However, this Tribunal has determined that as the Supreme Court decision occurred after the First Award, the question of whether it operated to terminate any entitlement to damages could not be res judicata (Ibid., para.54.)\n\n147.\n\nIndonesia contended that the Supreme Court decision declared that the earlier judgment of January 12, 1983 was enforceable; that that entailed rescission of the managerial contract (rather than affirmation of BKPM's decision to revoke the licence agreement) ; and that therefore, as of that earlier date of January 12, 1982, Amco no longer had a contractual right to a share of profits (Counter-Memorial, pp.154-5).\n\n148.\n\nAmco argued that the Supreme Court decision was merely an affirmation of the prior decisions of the District and Appellate Courts; and as these had been found by the First Tribunal not to terminate any damages to which Amco was entitled, so a decision merely affirming them could equally not have that effect. Amco, unlike Indonesia, took the view that the lower courts had based their judgments essentially on the licence revocation. As the First Tribunal had given this as a reason for its ruling on the effect of these judgments, and as the Supreme Court judgment merely affirmed them, it too could not cut off the entitlement to compensation (Memorial, p.32). Amco and Indonesia elaborated their contentions in oral argument.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the arguments and studied the texts of each of the Indonesian court decisions. The starting point of its analysis is the finding of the First Tribunal on the lower court judgments that\n\n\"It is also right that the decision of the Jakarta courts to rescind was based on several grounds... However, among these grounds, the revocation of the licence was obviously fundamental and self-sufficient, as is shown by the very wording of the District Court Decision in this respect...\" (First Award, para.260) \"\n\n150.\n\nIndonesia states that the Ad Hoc Committee correctly found that the Supreme Court, when it came to deal with the matter \"approve[d] the rescission of the management contract exclusively on grounds other than those adduced in the [licence] revocation order\". (See Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee, para.115 ; and Counter-Memorial, p.155).\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that views on the basis of the Supreme Court decision go beyond the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Ad Hoc Committee and are necessarily obiter; and cannot determine the matter for this Tribunal, which must decide the issue itself.\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Supreme Court carefully laid out all the findings of the two lower courts and the arguments that had been advanced by the parties. The findings of the lower courts included (but were not restricted to) the failure to invest US$3m. And the stated ratio decidendi of the Supreme Court (Indonesia, Factual Appendix B, Tab.28) was simply that the lower courts' decisions were not contrary to law. It might be said that they thus were basing themselves on grounds other than licence revocation - but in the Tribunal ' s view the Supreme Court was affirming the grounds on which the lower courts based themselves. And central among these was the revocation of the licence. The Supreme Court did not find (because it was not asked to) that the revocation was invalid, but that PT Wisma still succeeded in having the management contract rescinded; nor did it find that the revocation was relevant, but that PT Wisma succeeded on other grounds. It essentially affirmed the earlier decisions, as they stood.\n\n153.\n\nThe Supreme Court judgment is thus not to be regarded as novus actus interveniens ; and therefore does not operate to terminate the damages due to Amco.\n\n(c) Unjust Enrichment\n---------------------\n\n154.\n\nAmco advanced as its third cause of action the claim that Indonesia would be unjustly enriched if permitted to retain both the benefits of Amco's investment and the earnings which Amco could have obtained from such investment. Amco contended that the concept of unjust enrichment was recognised in the law of Indonesia and also in international law (Memorial, pp.58-62).\n\n155.\n\nIndonesia denied the applicability of the concept to the facts of the case as any beneficiary would have been PT Wisma. Indonesia further offered a legal opinion of Professor S. Gautama (Indonesia, Legal App. Vol.II, Tab.P) that there was no recognised right of unjust enrichment in Indonesian law. It was further argued, by reference to diverse authorities, that the concept of unjust enrichment was not a sufficiently specific principle of international law to sustain a claim by Amco (see Counter-Memorial, pp.180-183); and, by reference to a legal opinion of Professor C. Schreuer, that no international law tribunal had ever allowed a claim of unjust enrichment where the applicant was in breach of its obligations under the contract in issue (Indonesia, Legal App. Vol.VIII, Tab.XXX). For its part, Amco contended that international authority acknowledged the principle of unjust enrichment even if the investor's loss did not arise out of an internationally unlawful act (Reply, pp.28-30).\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the beneficiary of any unjust enrichment (whether or not caused by illegal acts and whether or not Amco was itself in default) would have been PT Wisma and not Indonesia. It was PT Wisma that secured the benefit of the termination of PT Amco's entitlement to the share of the profits, once the Hotel had been built and was operational. Any advantage to the Indonesian government was too indeterminate to be identified as an unjust enrichment to the State without pronouncing upon whether the factual circumstances for the application of the concept existed, the existence of the concept in Indonesian law or its scope in international law. The Tribunal finds that on this ground Amco's third cause of action fails.\n\nVIII. COUNTERCLAIM\n------------------\n\n157.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, p.177, Indonesia claimed as follows:\n\n\"Under Indonesian law the failure of a foreign investor to fulfil its obligations under a license and to comply with the foreign investment law will result not only in the revocation of the license, but also in the 'withdrawal of all facilities that have been granted commencing from the date on which approval was granted'. Indonesian law thus provides for the restitution of all monies which would have been paid by the foreign investor, e.g. as taxes and import duties, but for the tax holiday granted by the license.\"\n\n158.\n\nAt the oral hearings the Tribunal was shown all the Indonesian law said to support this claim.\n\n159.\n\nDecree 63/1969 (Indonesia, Fact. App. A., Tab.3) provides in Article 4 that\n\n\"If the capital investment plan is not implemented in accordance with the approval that has been granted, this may result in the withdrawal of the business license that has been issued and/or the withdrawal of all facilities that have been granted commencing from the date on which approval was granted, unless it can be proven that the default occurred for reason beyond the control of the applicant.\"\n\n160.\n\nIn his Legal Opinion (Indonesia, Legal App. Vol.I, Tab.B) Dr. Komar also makes reference to decree 54/1977. Article 6 of this provides:\n\n\"In case the execution of the investment of capital is not in accordance with the agreement and stipulations determined by the Government and/or the capital investor does not fulfil his obligations to submit reports on the execution of the capital investment as stipulated in Article 4, sanction shall be applied to the capital investor in accordance with the laws and regulations in force, including the revocation of his permit to establish a business enterprise and/or the facilities/relief of fiscal duties already granted.\"\n\n161.\n\nIt is thus clear that a lawful revocation by BKPM could have included a decision to end the facilities and relief granted and to require the return of moneys represented by them. The revocation by BKPM (Indonesia Exh. Vol.II, Tab.63, at p.5) did include such provisions; but the Tribunal has already held it not to be a lawful revocation. It is also clear that BKPM could, even without terminating the licence, have decided that PT Amco was in violation of its obligations, that facilities would be withdrawn, and that moneys representing them were to be returned. But no such decision, separate from the revocation decisions, was ever made.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that, as Indonesia has not. succeeded in its primary claims, it fails in its counterclaim.\n\nIX. DAMAGES\n-----------\n\n163.\n\nThe issue of damages has to be addressed in relation to two different periods: (1) the period between April 1st (the army and police intervention) and July 9, 1980 (the BKPM decision) ; (2) the period subsequent to July 9, 1980.\n\n(1) The Period between April 1 and July 9. 1980\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nIt is res iudicata that there is an obligation to compensate for any damage caused by unlawful intervention of the army and police (Decision on Jurisdiction, para.48).\n\n165.\n\nThe present Tribunal has concluded that the events of April 1 1980 did not cause PT Amco loss of right to a share of the profits under the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement (which could at that moment still be legally claimed from PT Wisma). The Tribunal further held that access to the Hotel cash flow was fiduciary in nature and, whatever the practice may have been between the parties before April 1, 1980, PT Amco was accountable to PT Wisma for the use of those funds. Financial loss due to diminution of the profit level there might otherwise have been, under PT Amco's own management, is unproven. No other financial loss due to loss of management has been evidenced before the Tribunal.\n\n166.\n\nThe illegal army and police intervention of April 1, 1980 undoubtedly caused disturbance and burdens for Amco. The Tribunal's best assessment of the loss entailed by such disturbance and burdens over this period is US$10,000. This is awarded with interest at 6% from the date of this Award to the date of effective payment.\n\n(2) The Period Subsequent to July 9, 1980\n-----------------------------------------\n\n(a) Mitigation\n--------------\n\n167.\n\nBKPM's decision of July 9, 1980 caused PT Amco to lose its licence to engage in business ventures in Indonesia. It did not in terms cause PT Amco to lose all its rights under the Profit-Sharing Agreement of October 6, 1978 or the earlier Lease and Management Contract of April 22, 1968. It was contended by Indonesia before the Tribunal that PT Amco could still have sold its interests in these contracts to a third party and should indeed have done so, to mitigate any loss sustained by BKPM's decision to terminate its licence. It was said that both Indonesian and international law pointed to such a duty to mitigate damages. (Indonesia Counter-Memorial, pp.102, 106 and Komar Opinion, Indonesia Legal App., Vol.I, Tab.B, p.68). Amco did not contest that Indonesian law and international law both acknowledge the principle of mitigation, but claimed that there was no realistic prospect of it being able to mitigate its loss.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the 1968 Lease and Management Contract provided in clause 9(4) that \"the shares shall only be possessed by the LOCAL PARTNER and the OVERSEAS PARTNER and shall not be transferred to a third (3rd) party under whatever name or reason\". The Company envisaged under the 1968 contract was never established as the parties decided to proceed on the basis of a simple joint venture. The Tribunal notes that when PT Amco entered into a subcontract on August 22, 1969, and a sublease with Aeropacific Hotel Association on October 13, 1970, the concurrence of PT Wisma was formally provided. This indicates that transfer of PT Amco's rights could only take place with the consent of PT Wisma. Nothing in the 1978 ProfitSharing Agreement changed the situation. Further, even had PT Amco been entitled to assign its interests the events that had occurred since the beginning of April 1980 would have made it virtually impossible to find interested purchasers. The Tribunal finds that there was no failure on PT Amco's part to mitigate damages.\n\n169.\n\nThat being so, the Tribunal will now proceed to assess the loss suffered by PT Amco as a result of the revocation of the licence by BKPM,\n\n(b) Principles of Compensation\n------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nTo seek the relevant principles of compensation the Tribunal has examined both Indonesian law and international law. Amco claimed that Indonesian law requires \"compensation for proximately caused and foreseeable injury, including lost earnings, arising from a tortious act\". (Memorial, p.23). Indonesia emphasised that damages would not be awarded for uncertain or speculative loss. (Counter-Memorial, p.102). These arguments were expanded and elaborated in Amco's Reply, p.5 and Indonesia\u2019s Rejoinder, p.36; and in oral argument. The Tribunal has carefully considered the relevant provisions of the Indonesian Civil Code, especially Articles 1246 and 1365, as well as the treatises and cases cited by the parties, and the analyses thereon provided in the legal opinions of Dr. Komar and Mrs. Kusnander. Article 1365 of the Indonesian Civil Code provides: \"Persons responsible for any act in violation of the law which results in a loss to another person are obliged to replace such loss\" (Previously Filed Claimants' Documents, Vol.II, Tab.R). Article 1246 of the Indonesian Civil Code further provides: \"Cost, losses and interest which a claimant may claim shall consist of, in general, losses already suffered and profit which he would otherwise enjoy, subject to the exceptions and qualifications set forth below.\" (ibid,) None of the exceptions and qualifications are applicable in this case.\n\n171.\n\nThe following principles are to be found in the Indonesian law: damage and loss caused by illegal acts shall be compensated by the wrongdoer. Injury must have been caused by the wrongful act and have been foreseeable. Loss must be proved and there shall be no compensation for losses that are speculative. Lost profits (including forfeited earnings) are compensable to the extent they are not speculative: Said Wachdin v. Perseroan Terbatan N.V. Aniem. cited in the Opinion of Dr. Komar (Indonesia, Legal App.B, at p.7O); and Article 1246 of the Indonesian Civil Code.\n\n172.\n\nSo far as international law is concerned, it is clear that damages are due for harm caused by wrongful acts. The Tribunal has characterised the BKPM revocation as a denial of justice. As with Indonesian law, the loss must be attributable to the wrongful act and foreseeable. And non-speculative loss may be recovered,\n\n173.\n\nIndonesia contended that the damage to Amco was caused neither by the army and police action, nor by BKPM's procedural irregularities, nor by its revocation of the licence, but rather by Amco's own wrongful actions which entitled BKPM to terminate the licence. Indonesia further claimed that, if damages were due, they could only be in respect of profit levels that were foreseeable. Indonesia also contended that PT Amco should not recover any lost profits beyond the date of this Award, The Tribunal addresses each of the arguments in turn.\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the general background to the BKPM decision constituted a denial of justice, and led to a decision which was indeed the cause of harm to Amco. To argue, as did Indonesia, that although there had been procedural irregularities, a \"fair BKPM\" would still have revoked the licence, because of Amco's own shortcomings, is to misaddress causality. The Tribunal cannot pronounce upon what a \"fair BKPM\" would have done. This is both speculative, and not the issue before it. Rather, it is required to characterise the acts that BKPM did engage in and to see if those acts, if unlawful, caused damage to Amco. It is not required to see if, had it acted fairly, harm might then have rather been attributed to Amco's own fault.\n\n175.\n\nAs to foreseeability, it appeared to be Indonesia's contention that, if compensation was due at all, only those foregone profits that could be foreseen in 1980 were compensable. But foreseeability goes to causation and damages, and normally not to the quantum of profit. That the revocation of the licence would cause Amco to be unable to secure its share of the profits under the Profit-Sharing Agreement was undoubtedly foreseeable. The principle of foreseeability does not require that the party causing the loss is at that moment of time able to foresee the precise quantum of the loss actually sustained.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns from causation and foreseeability to the issue of whether compensation allows recovery of future profits. There is one school of thought in contemporary international law that suggests that future profits (lucrum cessans) is not available in the case of a lawful taking, where only damage actually sustained (damnum emergens) is recoverable: see Amoco International Finance Corp, v. Islamic Republic of Iran, (US-Iran Tribunal Reports 247, Indonesia, Legal App. Vol.VII, Tab.FFF); and Liamco v. Libyan Arab Republic, (62 ILR 140, Indonesia Legal App., Vol.V, Tab.RR); per Judge Ameli in INA Corp, v. Islamic Republic of Iran. (8 Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports at 411, Indonesia Legal App., Vol.V, Tab.00). Another school holds that lucrum cessans is available for lawful as well as unlawful takings. For cases awarding an element for future lost profits although the taking was lawful, see American International Group Inc. v. Iran. (4 Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports 96, Indonesia, Legal App. Vol.VI, Tab.DDD) ; and Kuwait v. Aminoil. (ILM (1982) 977, Indonesia, Legal App. Vol.V, Tab.SS). See also Judge Brower in Sedco Inc, v, NIOC. (10 Iran-US Claims Tribunal at 197, Ibid., Vol.V, Tab.QQ). For useful commentary on this issue, see Gray, Judicial Remedies in International Law (1987), esp. Ch.5, (Ibid., Vol.V, Tab.TT).\n\n177.\n\nBut neither Indonesia (which proclaimed the BKPM action lawful) nor Amco contested that profits could in principle be recovered. The dispute was rather as to what profits could be reasonably certain, and what speculative. In any event, the Tribunal has found the BKPM action unlawful.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, where there has been an unlawful taking of contract rights, lost profits are in principle recoverable. No position is here taken, or need to taken, on the situation in a lawful taking. As it was put in the Shufeldt Claim (USA v. Guatemala) \"The damnum emergens is always recoverable, but the lucrum cessans must be the direct fruit of the contract and not too remote or speculative.\" (Indonesia Legal App., Vol.VI, Tab.W at p.1069). It is equally clear from the May Case (Guatemala v. USA), (ibid,. Tab.WW, at p.72) that recovery was to be allowed for profits that would have been over the remaining period of the contract. The arbitrator stated that he could not lay down the law on damages more clearly than it had been put by Guatemala: \"that whoever concludes a contract is bound not only to fulfil it but also to recoup or compensate (the other party) for damages and prejudice which result directly or indirectly from the non-fulfilment or infringement by default or fraud of the party concerned and that such compensation includes both damage suffered and profits lost: damnum emergens et lucrum cessans.\" (ibid,. p.73). The Tribunal concludes that BKPM's action was a denial of justice which effectively deprived Amco of its contract rights, and that non-speculative profits under that contract are recoverable.\n\n179.\n\nIndonesia advanced the claim (Counter-Memorial, p.156) that PT Amco \"should not recover expected lost profits beyond the date of judgment\". Cited in support of this was a dictum in the Chorzow Factory Case that the compensation due was the loss from the time of dispossession \"to the date of the present judgment\" (Amco, New Legal Exhibits, Tab.105; Indonesia, Legal App., Vol.I, Tab.AA; PCIJ (1928) Series A, No.17). This dictum is taken quite out of context, as the Permanent Court was considering restitution for an unlawful taking under an international treaty, and, on the particular facts, simply did not address the question of the future profit-generating capacity of the factory (still less of a property right that was only that of a stream of future profits) under general international law.\n\n180.\n\nNor is the reference in Indonesia's Counter-Memorial, p.157, footnote 425 to para.205 of Amoco International Finance v. Islamic Republic of Iran. op.cit., supra. at all convincing. The Chamber of the US-Iran Tribunal in that case was examining the Chorzow Factory Case (which we have already distinguished), and in terms with which this Tribunal would not necessarily agree.\n\n181.\n\nIndonesia further argues that this claim is supported by reference to the relief of the investor from risk \"once the investment arrangement is terminated\" (Counter-Memorial, p.158). The Tribunal's view on how risk is to be dealt with are offered below, paras.255 and 279-282. It is not a determinative factor in an argument as to whether ' lucrum cessans as well as damnum emergens is available.\n\n182.\n\nIt was urged on the Tribunal by Indonesia that, even allowing for non-speculative profits, the methods of valuation must reflect the value of the contract rights as they were perceived in 1980. Thus according to Indonesia, the valuation techniques should include no event or factor that was unknown or unascertainable in 1980.\n\n183.\n\nHowever, neither the concept of foreseeability (which has been discussed above) nor that of nonspeculation necessarily lead to this conclusion. The Tribunal believes that the key lies in focusing on the objectives of compensation where there has been an unlawful interference with contract rights. In Sapphire International Petroleum v. NIOC (35 ILR 136), a case of an unlawful taking, the arbitrator said:\n\n\"According to the generally held view the object is to place the party to whom they are awarded in the same pecuniary position they would have been in if the contract had been performed in the manner provided for by the parties at the time of its conclusion.\"\n\n184.\n\nThe Permanent Court of Justice in the Chorzow Factory Case held that, in an unlawful nationalisation, there must be restitution to establish the situation that would otherwise have existed, or, \"if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which restitution in kind would bear\" (PCIJ Series A, No.17, at 47). Commenting on this principle as it applies today, Judge Holtzmann wrote: \"While the TOPCO Award [17 ILM (1978) 3] directs restitutio in integrum, it emphasises, as did the Chorzow Factory Case, that awards of damages are intended to place the claimant in the same position as would restitutio in integrum \": Separate Opinion, INA Coro, v. Islamic Republic of Iran. 8 Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports 373 at 395.\n\n185.\n\nThis principle is well supported. Thus in the same case Judge Lagergren wrote: \"[I]t is well settled that the measure of compensation ought to be such as to approximate as closely as possible in monetary terms to the principle of restitutio in integrum... \" (INA Corp. Case, op-cit. supra, p.385). And Judge Ameli of Iran, in the same case, said; \"Where the conduct of a party is held to be unlawful, in terms of its contractual obligations, then the concept of restitutio in integrum may perhaps properly be invoked.\" (Ibid, p.4ll).\n\n186.\n\nIf the purpose of compensation is to put Amco in the position it would have been in had it received the benefits of the Profit-Sharing Agreement, then there is no reason of logic that requires that to be done by reference only to data that would have been known to a prudent businessman in 1980. It may, on one view, be the case that in a lawful taking, Amco would have been entitled to the fair market value of the contract at the moment of dispossession. In making such a valuation, a Tribunal in 1990 would necessarily exclude factors subsequent to 1980. But if Amco is to be placed as if the contract had remained in effect, then subsequent known factors bearing on that performance are to be reflected in the valuation technique. (cf. AmericanInternational Group Inc, v. Iran, op.cit., supra: but this was a lawful taking.) Foreseeability not only bears on causation rather than on quantum, but it would anyway be an inappropriate test for damages that approximate to restitutio in integrum. The only subsequent known factors relevant to value which are not to be relied on are those attributable to the illegality itself.\n\n187.\n\nWhile subsequent known events of a general nature, unrelated to the Kartika Plaza problems, may appropriately be an element in the valuation process, the effects of the taking itself must be excluded. It is well established in international law that the value of property or contract rights must not be affected by the unlawful act that removed those rights. (For recent affirmation, see Starrett Housing Corporation v. Iran. (4 Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports, Vol.3, 176 at 202; Indonesia, Legal App. VIII, Tab.ZZ).\n\n(c) The Method of Valuation\n---------------------------\n\n188.\n\nIt is the Tribunal's intention that its decisions on the method of valuation, and its reasons therefore, should be fully transparent.\n\n189.\n\nIndonesia has argued that, if damages were to be awarded to PT Amco, they should be established as \"the 'book value' of PT Amco's investment or, at most, the value of PT Amco's contract rights less any diminution in their value due to PT Amco's failure to sell promptly to a willing buyer in order to minimise its losses.\" (Indonesia CounterMemorial, p.138).\n\n190.\n\nThe question of Amco's alleged duty to mitigate its losses has been dealt with above. The appropriateness of the net book value method remains for consideration.\n\n191.\n\nNet book value has been described as \"assets minus liability without consequential damages\". (American International Group Inc, v. Iran. 4 Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports, 96 at 104). It can immediately be seen that it is a method unsuited to placing a party in the position of his contract having been performed.\n\n192.\n\nIndonesia argues that PT Amco should be entitled at most to only part of the Hotel ' s entire net book value of $585,000, and, in any event, to no more than PT Amco's total investment in the project determined by Bank Indonesia to be $933,992.65 (Indonesia Counter-Memorial, p.139).\n\n193.\n\nWhile it is true that the value of the assets has been used as the measure of damages in a number of international claims, it is by no means the prevailing method of valuation of damages (see \"L'\u00e9valuation des dommages dans les arbitrages transnationau\"x, Ignaz Seidl-Hohenveldern, Annuaire fran\u00e7ais de droit international. XXXIII - 1987\u201a pp.7-31). Net book value was rejected, inter alia, in the American International Group Case, (op.cit. supra ; Kuwait v. Aminoil, (op.cit., supra ; and in Liamco v. Libyan Arab Republic, (op.cit., supra, para.176). In fact, the book value basis of valuation seems to have been only used where compensation for prospective earnings was excluded for some reason (Indonesia Counter-Memorial, pp.139140), either \"in the absence of other evidence\" (Claim of Horst. Award of July 24, 1968, U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, No Cu-1418, p.3, Indonesia, Legal App. Vol.V, Tab.LL), or because a claim for prospective profits was \"not compensable under the Act\" (Claims of Aris Gloves Inc., Award of Jan.31, 1962, U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission No. CZ-3O35, p.240, ibid,. Tab.MM), or because the claimant himself had requested as damages the reimbursement of his invested capital (INA Corp, v. Islamic Republic of Iran (op.cit., supra), or the liquidation value of its equity interest (Sedco Inc, v. National Iranian Oil Co., 10 Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports 180, op.cit., supra). or again because the claimant's property had never become a \"going concern\" before the claim for damages arose (Phelps Dodge v. Islamic Republic of Iran. 10 Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports 121, Indonesia Legal App., Vol.V, Tab.PP).\n\n194.\n\nNone of the above arguments would appear to apply in the present case. Indonesian law specifically recognises the possibility of a claim for lost profits (Article 1246 of the Indonesian Civil Code, cited above, para.170) which envisages recovery for \"profit which he would otherwise enjoy\" if it is non-speculative and direct. See also Said Wachdin Case, op-cit., supra. para.\n\n195.\n\nFinally, the particular nature of PT Amco's rights does not make the book value method of valuation an appropriate technique. PT Amco was not the owner of the Hotel Kartika Plaza. In exchange for its investment in the Hotel, PT Amco obtained long-term contractual rights which consisted of the Lease and Management Contract of 1968 with PT Wisma with its various amendments, and the Profit-Sharing Agreement of 1978. These were not the type of assets to which the book value concept would be applicable.\n\n196.\n\nTaking all the above factors into consideration, the Tribunal will adopt the following methods for valuation of the stream of profits. The assessment will be divided into two periods, from July 9, 1980 until the end of 1989; and from 1990 until 1999. For both of the periods there are some matters of law and some of judgment that the Tribunal must address. But as to valuation techniques, for 198 01989 the Tribunal will not use the perspective of what the reasonable businessman in 1980 could foresee, because for this period it can use known data for relevant factors, including the year-byyear inflation rate, as provided to the Tribunal by the World Bank, from Laporangan Minggu, Bank Indonesia, as well as actual exchange and taxation rates. For 1980-1989 the Tribunal will increase the value of the base year by the yearly inflation rate (infra. paras.201-203), in order to maintain the real value of that base year over the period. Interest on the annual sums due will serve to bring them to present day values. However, from January 1, 1990 (1989 being the last full year for which known factors are available) and forwards, the Tribunal finds the DCF method appropriate to establish the net present value of PT Amco's rights for the remaining period of the lease, by capitalising earnings and expenditures which would otherwise have been spread over the future years of the life of the 1978 Profit Sharing Agreement. In applying these two techniques to each of these periods, the Tribunal is mindful that PT Amco\u2019s rights were 65% of the stream of profits until September 30, 1984? and 50% thereafter until September 30, 1999.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered whether the applicable law permits the use of these methods of valuation. As to DCF, it is neither prescribed nor prohibited (nor would one expect it to be) in the Indonesian Civil Code. The DCF method has been used in appropriate international awards: e.g. Starrett Housing Corporation v. Iran (op.cit., supra) and Phillips Petroleum Company Iran v. Iran. 21 Iran-US Claims Tribunal Reports 79. As to the first method to be applied to the period July 9, 1980 until December 31, 1989, it is one that is logically indicated by the finding that the purpose of compensation is to put Amco in the position of having received the benefits of the contract during this period. The Tribunal finds it a method that is entirely consistent with Indonesian law and international law.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal notes also that both parties in the present case have acknowledged the appropriateness of the DCF method for the entire valuation, even though there have been contested views as to the application of the component elements, and even though Indonesia has constantly emphasised that the method should not be used in such a way as to allow the inclusion of speculative profit. The several reports by accounting experts introduced by each party before the First Tribunal, as well as before the present Tribunal, all used the discounted cash flow method of valuation. See for Amco: the Arthur Young and Company report of 1982 (Previously Filed Claimants' Documents, Vol.I, Tab.28); the Pannell Kerr Foster reports of 1983 (ibid, Vol.II, Tab.137), and of 1988 (New Factual Exh., Tab.156). See for Indonesia: the Horwath and Horwath (UK) Ltd. reports of 1984 (Previously Filed Respondent's Exh., Tab.240); of September 10, 1988 (Indonesia Exh., Vol.V, Tab.90); and of November 11, 1988 (ibid,. Vol.VI, Tab.103).\n\n199.\n\nWhile adopting this technique in respect of the period after December 31, 1989, the Tribunal calls attention to the fact that it is not a mechanistic device. The method itself relies on the application of assumptions which are necessarily judgmental. The DCF method is at once a flexible tool, that allows for an application of factors and elements judged as relevant. At the same time, it allows for the application of these judgmental elements to be articulated.\n\n200.\n\nThis being said, the Tribunal has to examine the assumptions upon which the future income of the Hotel could be forecast, that Hotel being the only source of income of PT Amco. On that subject, PT Amco and Indonesia presented divergent views on several issues; these will be addressed seriatim, in relation to the two valuation periods.\n\n(d) Assumptions relating to Valuation of Hotel Profits: 1980-1989\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) The base period\n-------------------\n\n201.\n\nThe Pannell Kerr Foster report of 1983 (op.cit., supra), upon which PT Amco relies, was based on a market research on the hotel industry in Jakarta, including the Kartika Plaza Hotel, for years 19781983. It also assumed that a loan of US$3 million, which had been undertaken by PT Amco under the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement would be made and used for renovations and that the investment would upgrade the Hotel to a four-star status.\n\n202.\n\nThe Horwath and Horwath reports (op.cit., supra) were based on the average monthly net profit of the Hotel for the fifteen month period beginning January 1, 1979 and ending March 31, 1980.\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that the base period adopted by Horwath and Horwath is the sounder, reflecting the period when Amco actually was managing the Hotel. This base period will be used to arrive at an annualised figure which will constitute the base year. The base period suggested by Pannell Kerr Foster would include elements that would be too speculative and would rely substantially on PT Wisma's management period, brought about by the unlawful acts of the army and police.\n\n(ii) The office and store rental income\n---------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nIn their pleadings before the first Tribunal, Amco and Indonesia both used the base year office and store rental derived from the 1982 Arthur Young Report and which was set at Rp. 149 million (o p\u201a\u00e7it., supra).\n\n205.\n\nBefore this Tribunal, Amco argued that, based on newly available audited statements of PT Wisma, that figure was too low by at least 50 per cent. Upward adjustments were requested on the basis that (a) 1981 should be used as a base year instead of the 15 month 1979-1980 period; (b) a portion of the store rental income was included on PT Wisma's books rather than the Hotel's books; (c) actual rental performance after 1980 would justify an increase in Horwath and Horwath's projections; and (d) Horwath and Horwath had double counted the expenses which Arthur Young charged against gross revenue by including them in the expense portion of the 15-month accounts used to determine base-year Hotel profits.\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept the arguments raised under points (a), (b) and (c) above as they are predicated on events occurring under PT Wisma management. PT Wisma management was the consequence of the intervention of the army and police on April 1, 1980 and of the BKPM decision of July 9, 1980. Financial results obtained by this management are not to be relied on in seeking to identify what would have happened had PT Amco\u2019s contract rights remained intact. The same base period should be used as for hotel profits. As for (d), doublecounting, no evidence has been adduced before the Tribunal demonstrating that store expenses had been included in the management accounts as part of the expenses of the Hotel operation. The Tribunal finds it too speculative to assume such a possibility.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore accepts the Arthur Young estimate of Rp. 149 million (at 1980 values) for office and store store rental income as a reasonable base figure.\n\n(iii) The level and the depreciation rate of the replacement reserve\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nIn their reports prepared for the first Tribunal, Pannell Kerr Foster used a 2% while Horwath and Horwath used a 4% replacement reserve of gross revenue from Hotel and office rental, to cover the replacement cost of unserviceable furniture, fixtures and equipment. In both cases, the reserve was expensed in the year it was taken.\n\n209.\n\nIn their 1988 reports and in their testimony before this Tribunal, Horwath and Horwath argued that a 5% charge should be retained as the replacement reserve and that it should be capitalised and depreciated over five years. It was argued, inter alia, that the actual expenditure between 1981 and 1987 was considerably higher than the amount produced by a 4% reserve. For their part, Pannell Kerr Foster argued in their 1988 report that the replacement reserve should be depreciated over a seven year period and should be based on 4% of hotel and commercial revenues.\n\n210.\n\nExcluding those subsequent events directly related to the unlawful act, the Tribunal finds it inappropriate to rely on the level of expenditure incurred by PT Wisma between 1981 and 1987 to establish the replacement reserve rate. Taking into account the various reports produced by the parties and the evidence adduced, the Tribunal finds a four per cent (4%) rate to be adequate in the circumstances.\n\n211.\n\nAs to the depreciation period, the Tribunal believes that, taking account of the type of assets (equipment, furniture, etc) that the reserve was intended to cover, a five year depreciation period is appropriate. It was also argued by Amco that the reserve should be decreased during the last few years of the Profit-Sharing Agreement, since PT Amco would not have allocated the same sum as a replacement reserve when the expiry of the Agreement was in sight. The Tribunal does not share that view. Being responsible for the management of the hotel, PT Amco was expected to keep it in good running condition for the whole of the ProfitSharing Agreement, and this was expected in the Ramada Licence Agreement (Previously Filed Claimants' Documents, Vol.I, Tab.16). The Tribunal concludes that the same rate of replacement reserve should be maintained until the end of the Agreement. Finally, Amco argued that depreciation should not be extended over the term of the Agreement, on the principle that depreciation belonged to PT Amco. As will be seen below, the Tribunal does not believe that, under the Profit-Sharing Agreement, PT Amco could appropriate depreciation to itself, but rather that it should be deducted from hotel profits before distribution in the appropriate shares between PT Amco and PT Wisma. In these circumstances, there appears no valid reason to decrease replacement in the last few years of the Agreement. The Tribunal has also concluded that the maintenance reserve should be calculated on the combined gross revenue of hotel and office rental. The base year figures for office rental did not appear to have included a deduction for such figures.\n\n(iv) Entitlement to depreciation\n--------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nStrong disagreement was expressed by the parties as to the way depreciation should be treated.\n\n213.\n\nPT Amco argued, first, that it was entitled to the depreciation of the capital assets of the Hotel (Reply, pp.43-45) and, second, that PT Aeropacific's asset contributions to the Hotel should be included in the Hotel depreciation from the effective date of the transfer of rights between PT Aeropacific and PT Amco in 1980.\n\n214.\n\nAs to Indonesia, it argued that, under the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement, PT Amco was not entitled to depreciation (see especially Counter-Memorial, p.171, fn.46l and Rejoinder, pp.66-9). While Horwath and Horwath had in its 1984 Report added depreciation to PT Amco's income anticipated under its contract, it changed its interpretation of the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement in its 1988 reports and concluded that PT Amco was only entitled to a share of the net profit after tax of the Hotel. Depreciation was deducted, as normally done, in arriving at the net profit. (See Indonesia, Exh., Vol.V, Tab.90, p.4; Amco, New Factual Exh., Tab.156, pp.37-8).\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal heard evidence that, between 1968 and 1978, the practice followed between the parties was for PT Amco to keep the depreciation. In the Tribunal's opinion clause 5(a) of the Lease and Management Contract, when read together with clause 5(b), leaves it unclear that PT Amco was entitled to do this.\n\n216.\n\nHowever, it is to the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement that the Tribunal must refer, that Agreement changing and adding to the 1968 Lease and Management Contract and declaring null and void all previous provisions \"contrary and/or not in accordance with THIS AGREEMENT\" (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.47, clause 2B(1) and clause 3.3). The 1978 Agreement stipulates that one of its purposes is \"the best possible implementation of the elements\" of the 1968 Contract (ibid,. clause 2(a)). The Tribunal is of the view that the 1978 Agreement created a new regime between PT Wisma and PT Amco. Clause 2(b)(1) states specifically that \"the Lease and Management Contract shall be replaced and understood as the PROFIT-SHARING AGREEMENT FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE KARTIKA PLAZA LAND AND BUILDING...)\". PT Amco assumed the management responsibility for the whole complex and a profit-sharing scheme was established whereby between October 1, 1978 and September 30, 1984, PT Amco would receive 65% of the net income of the venture and 50% thereafter until September 30, 1999.\n\n217.\n\nIn clause 2(3)(b) it is provided:\n\nWhat is meant and intended by Net income is: \"Income which is received by the SECOND PARTY [PT AMCO) from all parties and rent or service for the use of Kartika Plaza land and buildings with its contents\"\n\nless (minus)\n\n\"all sorts of expenditures or costs which are needed for the Hotel Kartika's promotion, sales and after-sale routine maintenance (operating expenses and instandhouding) for the Kartika Plaza land and building, including corporate tax and insurance, IREDA (Regional Rehabilitation Contribution), and other state/regional contributions...\"\n\n218.\n\nWhile a detailed list of items to be deducted from gross income is enumerated, depreciation is not specifically mentioned. It might perhaps be thought that the reference to expenditures and costs needed for routine maintenance (including \"instanthouding\" - \"preservation\") is a reference to depreciation. However, deduction for routine maintenance does not cover depreciation of the hotel itself. The 1978 Agreement contains no provision for any payment of depreciation to PT Amco.\n\n219.\n\nThere is no evidence that, subsequent to 1978, PT Wisma accepted PT Amco's previous practice of keeping the depreciation. PT Amco's 1978 and 1979 financial reports were contested by PT Wisma, both before and after the events of April 1, 1980.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that a reading of the terms of the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement and reference to the customary accounting definition of net income (i.e. income subsequent to deduction of depreciation) leads to the view that hotel depreciation was to be deducted from gross income before arriving at the net income to be shared between the parties. PT Amco was thus not entitled to retain depreciation before proceeding to any distribution of the profits.\n\n221.\n\nA further depreciation issue arose in relation to the treatment of the depreciation for the Rp. 421,451,054 (US$1,015,000) net book value of additional fixed assets in the Hotel carried on the books of Aeropacific and transferred to Amco under the Amco/Aeropacific Settlement Agreement of March 29, 1980 (Previously Filed Claimants' Documents, Tab.18). Amco argued that Horwath and Horwath were wrong in their 1984 report not to include any depreciation for those assets and that it should be entitled to the whole of that depreciation (Memorial, p.80; and Reply, p.49). Indonesia contested this, emphasising that Aeropacific held no title to the capital assets of the Kartika Plaza Hotel (Counter-Memorial, p.140; and Rejoinder, p.69). In its November 1988 Report, Horwath and Horwath agreed to include an element for that depreciation in the profit and loss account of the Hotel but, in accordance with Indonesia\u2019s view of the matter, allocated it to PT Wisma as Hotel owner, and not to PT Amco. This reduced Amco's projected net income.\n\n222.\n\nSome Rp. 421,451,054 (US$1,015,000) was on the books of Aeropacific for the construction it had done, and was then assigned to PT Amco under the PT Amco/Aeropacific Settlement Agreement (op.cit., supra). This situation was not changed, in the Tribunal's view, by the formal provision in Clause 9(1)(4) of the Sub-Lease of October 13, 1970 (approved by PT Wisma) that all alterations or improvements passed forthwith to PT Amco (Indonesia Exh., Vol.II, Tab.42). The reality remained that Aeropacific acted for PT Amco and the assets transferred back to PT Amco under the 1980 Settlement Agreement should be included in the hotel assets subject to depreciation. In the light of the Tribunal's findings (above, para.220) on depreciation, such depreciation should be deducted before arriving at net income for the purpose of the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement.\n\n(v) Entitlement to cash flow\n----------------------------\n\n223.\n\nAmco argued (Reply, p.43) that it was entitled to the Hotel cash flow, less PT Wisma's profit share. The arguments advanced by each of the parties on this issue essentially mirrored the arguments deployed on entitlement to depreciation.\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with Amco's claim under this head. As indicated above, para.61, PT Amco as manager had access to the Hotel cash flow and could decide on its use for hotel purposes. But this access was of a fiduciary nature. PT Amco did not have proprietary rights over the cash flow.\n\n(vi) The impact of the Ramada Contracts\n---------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nOn July 4, 1979, PT Amco entered into two contracts: a Licence Agreement with Ramada Inns Inc. (op.cit.,supra) and a Management Agreement with Ramada International Inc. (Previously Filed Claimants' Documents, Vol.I, Tab.17). Under those agreements, Ramada licensed the use of its name by the Hotel, agreed to link it to Ramada's international booking system and to provide it with top quality managers. These agreements were approved in writing by PT Wisma (Ibid,. Tabs. 16 and 17). The Ramada fees were paid by PT Amco and an experienced Ramada Manager, Mr. A.S. Shussel, was appointed by Ramada at the end of 1979. He had been in charge for a little over three (3) months when the army and the police actions occurred on April 1, 1980.\n\n226.\n\nIn their 1984 report, Horwath and Horwath included some Rp. 178 million of expenses attributable to PT Amco's affiliation with Ramada, but did not include any incremental profit that could be reasonably expected to result from such affiliation. Amco has contended before this Tribunal that such profit element should be included in compensation due to it.\n\n227.\n\nAmco has contended (Memorial, p.89) that It would have been reasonable to assume that the Ramada management combined with the Ramada name and sophisticated booking system would have added at least 25 per cent to gross revenues, and that at least fifty per cent of this increase would have represented profit, from which Ramada's fees would be deducted. This factor was claimed by Amco to represent an upward adjustment of US$301,000,000 to the present value of Amco's share of the profits.\n\n228.\n\nClearly Amco entered into the Ramada agreements in the belief that they would secure significant benefits. At the same time, the Ramada Licence Agreement was subject to stringent covenants and conditions. The agreements were to run for ten years with two additional five year options. PT Amco covenanted:\n\n\"To maintain a high moral and ethical standard and atmosphere at LICENSEE'S Hotel; to comply with all local, state and federal laws, ordinances, rules and regulations... ; to maintain its premises and accommodations in a clean, attractive, safe and orderly manner, and to provide efficient, courteous and high quality service to the public, and to furnish hotel accommodations, services and conveniences of the same high quality and distinguishing characteristics as provided at Ramada Inns in and around the United States and elsewhere so that the Hotel operated by the LICENSEE hereunder shall help to create and maintain goodwill among the public for the system as a whole.\"\n\n229.\n\nPT Amco's ability to benefit from the Ramada connection thus depended upon its own ability to comply with the Covenants. Further, the fees to be paid under the Licence Agreement and the Management Agreement were substantial. These fees were unrelated to the ascertainability of benefits deriving from Ramada.\n\n230.\n\nUnder the Licence Agreement a royalty fee in the amount of 3 per cent of gross room sales was to be paid. In addition Amco was to pay a sum equal to US$0.17 per currently available and sellable room per night or 1.2 per cent of gross room sales, whichever was greater, or such additional sum or sums as would from time to time be required by Ramada Inns upon recommendation of Ramada Inns Association. Under the Management Agreement Amco was to pay a management fee of 25 per cent of gross operating profit defined as the amount remaining after deducting all \"expenses of operation\" from all \"gross revenues\". Gross revenues consisted of revenues or income or sale of any kind. Operating expenses did not include payments (whether principal or interest) relating to financing of capital improvements or incumbering the hotel, depreciation, insurance premiums, etc.\n\n231.\n\nDuring the oral hearings evidence was given as to the way the Ramada contracts were working in the early phase of their life.\n\n232.\n\nTaking all of these factors into account, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that any projections as to whether these contracts would have been beneficial cannot meet the test of being nonspeculative. The elements of uncertainty are simply too great. The Ramada factor should be treated as a neutral element. The Tribunal therefore adopts the alternative approach adopted by Horwath and Horwath in its 1988 reports, which excluded the Ramada fees from the results for the period to March 31, 1980 but which also excluded any future enhancement of earnings resulting from the Ramada contracts (op.,ci t., supr a, pp.21, 22, 26).\n\n(vii) The hotel market, in Jakarta 1980-1983\n--------------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nApplying the principle that it is appropriate to give effect to known factors unrelated to the licence revocation or unlawful takeover of the hotel, the Tribunal has considered the evidence as to the state of the hotel market. This evidence has only been provided for the period 1980-1983. The issue was addressed by the parties in their briefs, see Amco Memorial, p.68; Indonesia CounterMemorial, pp.162-166; Amco Reply, p.65; and Indonesia Rejoinder, pp.54-57.\n\n234.\n\nPannell Kerr Foster made extensive market research for the period 1978-1983 (Previously Filed Claimants\u2019 Documents, Vol.II, Tab.137). Section III contains information on the historical growth in supply.\n\n235.\n\nJones Lang Wootton prepared a report dated February 28, 1984 (Indonesia Exh. Vol.IV, Tab.81). The report contains information on available hotel rooms and planned investments in the hotel industry in Jakarta..\n\n236.\n\nHaving examined the argument and evidence presented, including the fragmentary data on historical growth and the projections of the experts, the Tribunal has concluded that the state of the hotel market does not fall into the category of facts of sufficient certainty to have had an impact on profit levels to be compensated. No element for this is thus reflected in the calculations.\n\n(viii) The treatment of corporate taxes\n---------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nIn their September 1988 report, Horwath and Horwath contended that, under the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement, Amco\u2019s profit share should be calculated after, rather than before, income taxes (op.cit., supra. p.4). This point of view was different from the one adopted by the same experts in their 1984 report.\n\n238.\n\nPannell Kerr Foster, in their October 1988 report, stated that this was a matter of legal interpretation, not of accounting, and that Horwath and Horwath's first interpretation was the right one.\n\n239.\n\nWhile the financial impact of one option versus the other does not appear to be major, the issue generated considerable argument between Amco and Indonesia at the Washington hearings, PT Amco contending that the only taxes which were deductible were the property and business taxes relative to the Hotel and Indonesia contending that all taxes, including corporate taxes, should be deducted. Much of the debate had to do with the translation to be given to the words pajak perusahaan in clause 3(b) of the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement. At the request of the Tribunal, additional written information was provided by the parties, after the Washington hearings, concerning the proper translation of those terms.\n\n240.\n\nThe Hotel Kartika Plaza was at no time incorporated as an entity separate from PT Amco and PT Wisma. It would have been normal business practice for the parties to pay separately the corporate tax after the distribution of hotel profits rather than having such a charge deducted from hotel profits before distribution. This procedure would have been all the more logical given that clause 3(b) of the 1978 Agreement provides for the deduction of \"all kinds of expenditures or costs required for promotion, sales and after sales service or routine (operation and maintenance costs) of Hotel Kartika Plaza for the land and buildings of Kartika Plaza (...)\" (Previously Filed Claimants\u2019 Documents, Vol.I, Tab.15, para.2(b), 3(b)). In common accounting procedure corporate taxes would not be interpreted as being included in the above-mentioned types of deductible expenses.\n\n241.\n\nAmco referred to the Corporate Tax Act of 1925 where the words \"pajak pierseroan\" are used to describe the corporate tax. It also refers to the Indonesian-English Dictionary by Echols and Shadily which defines \"perusahaan\" as \"business, enterprise, undertaking, concern\".\n\n242.\n\nIn practice, the word \"perusahaan\" seems to be given a rather broad meaning which could include a business as a corporate as well as a physical entity. Thus, PT Amco's investment application of May 6, 1968 (Previously Filed Claimants' Documents, Vol.I, Tab.5) refers to PT Amco as a \"perusahaan\" in Articles 1 and 9. In addition, the translation of the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement produced by Amco uses the expression \"company ta\"x for the words \"pajak perusahaan\". The words following those quoted above in para.2(b) 3(b) of the Agreement read: \"(...) including insurance and company ta\"x (\"assuransi dan pajak perusahaan\" in the Indonesian text).\n\n243.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, the words \"pajak perusahaan\" could be translated by \"company (or corporate) ta\"x. The practice followed by PT Amco and PT Wisma should help determine whether, in this instance, the parties meant corporate tax to be deducted before profit distribution under the 1978 Agreement.\n\n244.\n\nEvidence produced before the Tribunal indicates that this was the interpretation adopted by PT Amco in its relationship with PT Wisma. In a letter of March 19, 1980, addressed by Mr. E.M. Tomodok, ViceChairman of PT Amco, to Mr. H. Soltpipto, principal director of PT Wisma (Indonesia Exh., Vol.I, Tab. 53, p.3), it is stated:\n\n\"Because in the 'Profit-Sharing Agreement' dated 6 October 1978, company taxes and also 'investment expenses' are deducted from the calculation for distribution of net income, we hereby would also like your assessment concerning these costs.\n\nCompany taxes are estimated at Rp. 20,000,000 and investment costs are Rp. 54, 878, 741.00\".\n\n245.\n\nThe Rp. 20,000,000 amount appears consistent with the amount that would have to be paid by the Hotel on the basis of the corporate tax rates in effect at the time.\n\n246.\n\nOn the basis of all the above, the Tribunal concludes that Amco\u2019s share of profits should be calculated after, rather than before, corporate income taxes.\n\n(ix) Tax rates to be applied\n----------------------------\n\n247.\n\nIn its September 1988 report, Horwath and Horwath stated that the 1984 rather than the 1980 tax rates should be applied to post-1983 earnings (op.cit., supra, p.7). In its report of February 28, 1984, Horwath and Horwath had applied uniformly the 1980 rates. Before this Tribunal, Indonesia argued that the 1984 tax rates should apply to post-1983 earnings and stated that the use of the 1984 tax rates probably lead to a lower tax burden than the 1980 rate because of a new configuration of tax rates and the elimination of a 20% dividend tax.\n\n248.\n\nFor its part, PT Amco argued that, while the impact of the 1984 tax rates would not have been necessarily negative, it was preferable to abide by what was reasonably foreseeable in 1980 and that, if one were to accept the 1984 rates, one should include a provision for the periodic indexation of tax rates over the whole period covered by the Award.\n\n249.\n\nThe changes in taxation rates are known facts which would have been relevant to Amco had its contract remained in effect. Further, these changes in rates were unconnected with events surrounding the Kartika Plaza controversy. The 1980 taxation rates remained unchanged until 1984 and will therefore be applied for the period 1980-1983. A new taxation rate, which is still in existence, was established in 1984, and will be applied for the period 1984-1989. Applying known facts to put Amco in the position it would have been in had its contract been implemented, equally makes an element for indexation inappropriate.\n\n(x) The exchange rate\n---------------------\n\n250.\n\nIn order to \"minimise current value changes\", and since hotel rates are quoted in US dollars, Pannell Kerr Foster in its 1983 report estimated all figures in US dollars, after having converted the base period into such dollars at the 1980 exchange rate (op.cit., supra. section 1, p.ll).\n\n251.\n\nBy contrast, Horwath and Horwath converted PT Amco's profit in a given year between 1981 and 1988 at the then applicable exchange rate and then discounted such dollar amount to present value. For years after 1988, the 1988 exchange rate (Rp. 1663.1 per dollar) was used (Indonesia Exh., Vol.V, Tab.90, p.6).\n\n252.\n\nAlthough no definitive evidence to that effect was introduced before the Tribunal, it would appear that most of the Hotel income was earned in rupiahs. However, the currency in which the income was earned does not bear on whether the estimated Hotel profits between 1980 and 1999 should be converted on the basis of the current exchange rates of the year the income is earned or on the basis of the 1980 exchange rate.\n\n253.\n\nThe objective is to put Amco in the position it would have been in had its contract been performed. Profits would have been converted year by year, and the differences in exchange rates year by year were known facts unrelated to the unlawful acts that prevented the contract being performed. It follows that the rupiah earnings should be converted each year at the appropriate exchange rate:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Rp |\n| 1980  1981  1982  1983  1984  1985  1986  1987  1988  1989 | 629.99  631.76  661.42  909.26  1,025.94  1,110.58  1,282.56  1,643.85  1,685.70  1,770.06 |\n\n(Source : IMF International Financial Statistics, Vol.XL (1987) and Vol.XLIII (1990)).\n\n(xi) The inflation rate\n-----------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe actual year by year average inflation rate between 1980 and 1990 will be applied to the hotel and office store rental profits. The figures to be applied, as provided to the Tribunal by the World Bank from Laporangan Minggu Bank Indonesia, are:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Rp |\n| 19809  1981  1982  1983  1984  1985  1986  1987  1988  1989 | 15.9  12.2  9.5  11.8  10.5  4.7  5.8  9.3  8.0  6.3 |\n\nThe average figure for 1980 is based on only ten months of data for 1979, the series beginning only in March 1979. The figure for 1989 is the provisional figure available at the date of the Award.\n\n(xii) Risk factor\n-----------------\n\n255.\n\nAs the valuation method employed for 1980-89 does not entail putting oneself in the position of a reasonable businessman in 1980, and thus including an element for unknown risks that might occur, no such factor is reflected in the figures for this first period.\n\n(xiii) Discount rate\n--------------------\n\n256.\n\nBecause of the valuation method to be applied to the period 1980-1989, the use of a discount rate does not arise.\n\n(xiv) Interest rate\n-------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the distinction advanced by Amco in its Memorial (see para. 31 above) that the Indonesian statutory rate of 6% per annum was inapplicable to monetary awards for wrongful acts to be untenable. It is res judicata that interest will be due at 6% per annum on the profits due year by year to Amco, until the time of payment. The First Tribunal, however, decided that interest was due at 6% per annum from January 15, 1981 (the date upon which ICSID proceedings commenced). There has been no finding by this Tribunal as to whether the date from which interest runs is res iudicata. nor has the matter been raised by the parties. Although the amount of damages upon which the interest accrues has been annulled, the view of the Tribunal is that the date from which the 6% (itself unannulled) runs is not annulled. In view of the valuation method used for the period 1980-1989, interest would in principle have run from January 1, 1981. However, due to this res ~iudicata. it will be treated as running from January 15, 1981.\n\n258.\n\nThe Award of the First Tribunal does not specifically state if the interest was to be simple or compound, but the absence of any directive that it be compounded on a yearly basis leads to the view that simple interest was awarded. The Tribunal has noted that in Amco's Memorial, p.192, they claim simple interest (while arguing for the Singapore rate). This Tribunal awards 6% simple interest per annum.\n\n(e) Assumptions relating to Valuation of Hotel Profits: 1990-1999\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe damages due up to 1990 are US$1,679,890.00. Interest up to May 31, 1990, the date of the Award, makes the damages due $USl,711,830.00. The Tribunal has now to consider the evaluation of damages over the remaining years of the lease. The discounted cash flow (DCF) method will be applied for the reasons given in paras.197-198 above.\n\n(i) The base period\n-------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe base period for calculations for 1990-1999 will be 1989, as it is the last year for which there are available figures that correspond in real terms to the 1980 profits.\n\n(ii) The office and store rental income\n---------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal will rely on the 1989 figures, which best reflect the value in real terms of the base period relevant to 1990-1999.\n\n(iii) The level and the depreciation rate of the replacement reserve\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nIssues relating to depreciation will be treated for this period identically to their treatment for the period 1980-89.\n\n(iv) Entitlement to depreciation\n--------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nThis will be treated as for the period 1980-89\n\n(v) Entitlement to cash flow\n----------------------------\n\n264.\n\nThis will be treated as for the period 1980-1989.\n\n(vi) The impact of the Ramada contracts\n---------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThis will be treated as for the period 1980-1989.\n\n(vii) The hotel market in Jakarta\n---------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nAs no evidence that is reasonably certain has been put to the Tribunal in relation to the period 19901999, no assumptions relating to this factor will be made.\n\n(viii) The treatment of corporate taxes\n---------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nThis will be treated as for the period 1980-1989.\n\n(ix) Tax rates\n--------------\n\n268.\n\nThe 1984 tax rate, which is currently effective, will be applied, as it appears to the Tribunal to be the best non-speculative rate available.\n\n(x) Exchange rate\n-----------------\n\n269.\n\nRupiah earnings will be converted at the 1989 exchange rate of 1,770.06 Rp., as it appears to the Tribunal to be the best non-speculative rate available.\n\n(xi) (xii) (xiii) Discount rate (including inflation rate and risk factor)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe issue of the discount rate to be used in order to arrive at net present value led to growingly divergent views between Amco and Indonesia as well as their experts.\n\n271.\n\nBefore the First Tribunal, they all agreed to use a discount rate of 15%, being 3% above the estimated annual inflation factor of 12%.\n\n272.\n\nIn their September 10, 1988 Report, Horwath and Horwath used two discount rates: the 15% rate which they had used in their 1984 report, or alternatively a 17% rate \"to reflect inherent business risk\". Then, on the basis of a report prepared by Professor David O.Dapice and dated November 14, 1988 (Indonesia Exh., Vol.VI, Tab.105), Horwath and Horwath submitted a new report dated November 11, 1988, recalculating the previously submitted models on the basis of a 30% discount rate for an income stream generated in rupiahs and repatriated annually into dollars and a 34% discount rate for a rupiah income stream discounted to 1980 and converted into dollars at the 1980 exchange rate (Indonesia Exh., Vol.VI, Tab.103, pp.16-17).\n\n273.\n\nAmco also argued that a discount rate lower than 15% should apply if a below-market statutory interest rate of 6% were applicable for measuring the value of the loss of money.\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Amco's argument that a relationship should be established between the Indonesian statutory interest rate and the appropriate discount rate that should apply to any income stream. The purpose of the discount rate is to establish the value of future income in present terms. A limited number of factors are taken into account to arrive at an appropriate discount rate, but the statutory rate of interest is not one of them.\n\n275.\n\nAs to the discount rates of 30% and 34% proposed by Indonesia, they arose from Professor Dapice's report of November 4, 1988. A central argument was that real rates of return of 20% were obtained from the Government of Indonesia during the eighties for the development of long-term projects; taking inflation into account, nominal rates were about 30%. Union Oil's development of a geothermal field in Indonesia was relied upon by Professor Dapice as a case in point.\n\n276.\n\nProfessor Dapice's analysis appears essentially valid in principle but largely irrelevant to the present situation.\n\n(1) While reference to large long-term investments such as the Union Oil project are interesting, it is pertinent to note that no evidence was produced of the kinds of rate of return expected in the service industry, and the hotel industry in particular, in the early eighties, still less the nineties.\n\n(2) If one were to accept Professor Dapice's figures, one would have to expect a similar analysis by the investor as to his expected rate of return in the future. One would therefore have to apply a similar rate of escalation for the Hotel's profits after 1980, assuming a rational investment decision. Instead, both Pannell Kerr Foster (for the period post-1983) and Horwath and Horwath (for the period post-1980) used a 12% escalation factor which corresponded to the average inflation rate between 1980 and 1983 and constituted their estimated annual rate up to 1999.\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted that in their report of November 1988, Horwath and Horwath refrain from any endorsement of Professor Dapice's conclusion. They merely state: \"We understand that Indonesia has been advised by economist Professor David Dapice of the appropriate discount rates to be applied (...). (...) We have used the discount rates provided by Professor Dapice and applied these to all the models (...)\" (Indonesia Exh. 103, pp.127).\n\n278.\n\nHowarth and Howarth and Pannell Kerr Foster used a 12% inflation figure representing the average inflation rates for the years 1980-1983. The Tribunal has noted that a significant decline in the rate of inflation has occurred in Indonesia in the decade 1980-90. It appears reasonable in the circumstances to use the average rate of inflation of the last five years (1985-1989) as a projection for the remaining period. The average rate of inflation of 1985-1989 is 6.82 per cent.\n\n279.\n\nAs to the risk factor, the Tribunal has noted with interest the analysis of Howarth and Howarth in their 1984 report, where they state:\n\n\"The estimated net cash flow of the Hotel (...) has been discounted to arrive at an estimated value at April 1980 at the rate of 15 per cent, being 3 per cent above the estimated annual inflation factor.\n\nWe have applied this relatively low margin over the assumed rate of inflation because the earnings have been based on known, historic results. If the earnings had been based on future projections of the Hotel's possible performance (taking into account the benefits of revised facilities, as in the case of the PKF report) we would have adopted a considerably higher margin over the rate of inflation in order to reflect the risks and uncertainties attached to such a projection.\" (Previously Filed Resp. Exh., Tab.240, para.3.1(g)).\n\n280.\n\nThe level of the risk factor at which the Tribunal arrives is heavily influenced by the fact that the level of assumed profit has been kept steady in real terms. The particular level of the risk factor is a matter of judgment. Pannell Kerr Foster set it at 3% (Previously Filed Claimants Documents, Vol.II, Tab.137: and New Fact. Exh., Tab.156) and Horwath and Horwath in 1984 set it originally at 3% (Previously Filed Resp. Exh. Tab.240, para.3(1)(g)) and in September 1988 at 5% (Indonesia Exh. Vol.V, Tab.90, p.6).\n\n281.\n\nAfter studying all the factors involved and in particular the fact that the projected hotel earnings have been based on known historic results, the trend in the US dollar and rupiah exchange rate, and given that Amco will receive in 1990 compensation paid in United States dollars, the Tribunal is of the view that a 4% risk factor should be adopted.\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that a discount factor of 10.82% (4% risk factor plus 6.82% average inflation rate for 1985-1989) should be used to arrive at the 1980 net present value of the Hotel earnings for the period 1990-1999.\n\n(f) Final Calculation of Damages\n--------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe figures reached on the basis of these principles have not been revised to reflect matters alluded to in paras.99-112 above. The Tribunal believes it is not for it to reflect those matters in the valuation, which should be objectively arrived at; but notes again that appropriate procedures existed in Indonesian law for the authorities to have addressed these matters, once the dispute between PT Wisma and PT Amco had focussed attention on them.\n\n284.\n\nThe final calculation of damages in the amount of US$2,696,330.00 with interest up to May 31, 1990 is shown below, at pp.169-170. The Tribunal has, in making the final calculation of damages, relied on the following (the reasoning for each of which has been elaborated above):\n\n1. Base period\n\n15 month period ending March 31, 1980. The hotel profit for the period was Rp. 181.2 million (Previously Filed Respondent's Exhibits Cited in Claimants' Memorial, Tab.240, para.3.1.a.; and Indonesia Exh., Vol.IV, Tab.82). The Ramada fee of Rp. 17.8 million, having been treated in the 197980 management accounts as an expense, is added back to the figures representing the 15 month base period. Thus the annualised base year results (12/15) are Rp. 159.2 million.\n\n2. Office and store rental profits\n\nRp. 149.17 million.\n\n3. Beginning and termination date\n\nFrom July 9, 1980 to September 30, 1999.\n\n4. Escalation rate\n\nYearly average inflation rate for the period July 9, 1980 to December 31, 1989. Average of the last five years (1985-1989) for the period January 1, 1990 to September 30, 1999, being 6.82%.\n\n5. Discount rate\n\nProjected inflation rate (average of 1985-1989: 6.82%), plus 4%, for the period of January 1, 1990 to September 30, 1999. The net present value is arrived at by discounting back to the date of the Award (May 31, 1990).\n\n6. Exchange rate\n\nAmco\u2019s profits to be converted into US dollars at the prevailing yearly rates for the period July 9, 1980 to December 31, 1989; and at the 1989 rate for the period January 1, 1990 to September 30, 1999.\n\n7. Depreciation\n\nHotel profit is net profit after depreciation, including Aeropacific depreciation. Depreciation is on a straight-line method, over a useful life of 20 years, with no salvage value.\n\n8. Replacement reserve and depreciation\n\n4% capitalised and depreciated over 5 years.\n\n9. Entitlement to cash flow\n\nNil.\n\n10. Corporate taxes\n\nAmco's share of profits to be calculated after deduction of corporate income taxes.\n\n11. Taxation rate\n\nActual annual prevailing tax rates, for the period 1980-1983. Rates established in 1984 and still in existence on the date of the Award, for the period 1984 to December 31, 1989. The current rate for 1989 for the period January 1, 1990 to September 30, 1999.\n\n12. Share of profits to Amco\n\nAccording to Profit-Sharing Agreement.\n\nJuly 9, 1980 to September 30, 1984: 65%\n\nOctober 1, 1984 to September 30, 1999: 50%\n\n13. Interest rate\n\nNon-compounded 6%, running from January 15, 1981.\n\n**Damages for the period July 9, 1980 to December 31, 1989**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year | 4% Replacement | (\\*) Hotel Profit | (\\*) Office/ Store Rental Profit | Depreciation of 4% Replacement | Depreciation | Aeropaciflc Depreciation | Profit Before Tax | Total Tax | Profit After Tax | AMCO Profit Share | U.S. dollar Conversion ($000) | Cumulative Total | Non- compounded 6% Interest | Total |\n| 1980  1981  1982  1983  1984  1985  1986  1987  1988  1989 | 26.78  62.32  68.24  76.29  84.30  88.26  93.38  102.06  110.23  117.17 | 88.97  207.02  226.69  253.44  280.05  293.21  310.22  339.07  366.20  389.27 | 71.93  167.37  183.27  204.89  226.41  237.05  250.80  274. 12  296.05  314.70 | 5.36  17.82  31.47  46.73  63.59  75.88  82.09  88.86  95.65  102.22 | 16.03  33.24  33.24  33.24  33.24  33.24  33.24  33.24  33.24  33.24 | 28.83  59.79  59.79  59.79  59.79  59.79  59.79  59.79  59.79  59.79 | 110.68  263.54  285.46  318.57  349.84  361.35  385.90  431.30  473.57  508.72 | 23.20  69.06  75.64  85.57  116.44  120.47  129.06  144.96  159.75  172.05 | 87.48  194.48  209.82  233.00  233.40  240.88  256.84  286.34  313.82  336.67 | 56.86  126.41  136.38  151.45  142.89  120.44  128.42  143.17  156.91  168.34 | 90.69  200.09  206.19  166.56  139.28  108.45  100.13  87.09  93.08  95.10 | 90.69  290.78  496.97  663.53  802.81  911.26  1,011.39  1,098.48  1,191.56  1,286.66 | -  5.22  17.45  29.82  39.81  48.17  54.68  60.68  65.91  71.49 | 90.69  205.31  223.64  196.38  179.09  156.62  154.81  147.77  158.99  166.59 |\n|  | 829,03 | 2,754.14 | 2,226.59 | 609.67 | 315.19 | 566.94 | 3,488.93 | 1,096.20 | 2,392.73 | 1,331.27 | 1,286.66 |  | 393.23(\\*\\*) | 1,679.89 |\n\n(\\*) Inflation adjusted\n\n(\\*\\*) To May 31,1990, the date of the Award, the amount of interest is $425.17 for a final total of $1,711.83.\n\n**Damages for the period January 1, 1990 to September 30, 1999**\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year | 4% Replacement | (\\*) Hotel Profit | (\\*) Office/ Store Rental Profit | Depreciation of 4% Replacement | Depreciation | Aeropacific Depreciation | Profit Before Tax | Total Tax | Profit After Tax | AMCO Profit Share | (\\*\\*) (U.S. $000) Present Value of Profits |\n| 1990  1991  1992  1993  1994  1995  1996  1997  1998  1999 | 125.16  133.70  142.81  152.56  162.96  174.07  185.94  198.63  212.17  169.98 | 415.81  444.17  474,46  506.82  541.39  578.31  617.75  659.88  704.89  564.72 | 336.16  359.09  383.58  409.74  437.68  467.53  499.42  533.48  569.86  456.54 | 109.60  117.66  125.81  134.28  143.44  153.22  163.67  174.83  186.75  188.16 | 33.24  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - | 59.79  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - | 549.34  685.60  732.23  782.28  835.63  892.62  953.50  1,018.53  1,088.00  833.10 | 186.27  233.96  250.28  267.80  286.47  306.42  327.72  350.49  374.80  285.59 | 363.07  451.64  481.95  514.48  549.16  586.20  625.78  668.04  713.20  547.51 | 181.54  225.82  240,97  257.24  274.58  293.10  312.89  334.02  356.60  273.75 | 102.56  115.12  110.85  106.78  102.85  99.07  95.43  91.93  88.56  61.35 |\n|  | 1,657.98 | 5,508.20 | 4,453.08 | 1,497.42 | 33.24 | 59.79 | 8,370.83 | 2,869.80 | 5,501.03 | 2,750.51 | 974.50 |\n\n(\\*) Inflation adjusted\n\n(\\*\\*) Present value to May 31,1990\n\nX. COSTS\n--------\n\n285.\n\nArticle 61 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes requires that the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, as well as fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and charges for the Centre, shall be paid.\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that Amco and Indonesia shall each bear the costs they have incurred in the preparation and presentation of their cases; and that the arbitrators ' fees and expenses and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be shared equally.\n\n287.\n\nAn issue has arisen which requires the Tribunal to decide if an adjustment should be made to this finding. On May 31, 1989 Amco wrote to the Tribunal, making certain allegations and attaching certain affidavit evidence. Amco claimed that certain of its documents had been taken by PT Wisma and not returned to it; Indonesia was responsible for this; and that Indonesia's counsel had had access to these documents. Amco asked that \"the Tribunal enter a preliminary award compensating Amco for the avoidable costs incurred over the years litigating a case while wrongfully deprived of its own files\". The sum sought was \"not less than $500,000\". Amco later (letter of July 25) appeared to think a preliminary hearing no longer necessary. On August 8, 1989 the Tribunal issued an Interlocutory Decision stating that it made no order for a separate preliminary hearing.\n\n288.\n\nAmco's request for \"compensation... for the avoidable costs\" was not made as a substantive claim in the Memorials, but rather as a separate request by letter in the period before the oral hearings. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it therefore falls to be considered as an element in that part of its Award which deals with costs.\n\n289.\n\nThe matter of allegedly stolen documents (going beyond the aspect of \"avoidable costs\" in relation thereto) was mentioned in the written pleadings, and in oral argument, and was dealt with in detail in the correspondence sent by the parties to the Tribunal (letters of Amco of May 31, June 16, July 25 and August 2; letters of Indonesia of June 15, July 14 and July 28).\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that the evidence shows that certain Amco documents were taken by PT Wisma; and that not all of these were returned or otherwise made available to Amco. The Tribunal further believes that this was done in consequence of the army and police intervention, and that it cannot be said that any such acts were those of PT Wisma alone, for which Indonesia bears no legal responsibility. However, the evidence (both in the correspondence and in the oral hearings) leaves the dimensions of this problem very unclear. For the most part, the Tribunal is not in a position to know what documents, unlawfully taken, were or were not returned. Moreover, as most of Amco\u2019s documents relevant to this case would have been expected to exist outside of Indonesia, it is also unclear what additional costs Amco had incurred in the preparation of this case.\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore makes no adjustment in this regard to its determination at para.286 above regarding costs.\n\nXI. SET-OFF OF ANNULMENT COSTS\n------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nAs applicant in the annulment proceedings, Indonesia was required under ICSID Financial Regulation 14(3)(e) to make advance deposits to cover all costs. In paragraph 125 of its Decision of May 16, 1986, the Ad Hoc Committee held that Amco should pay Indonesia one half of the cost of the annulment proceedings. The portion of the costs attributed to Amco remained unpaid at the outset of these proceedings.\n\n293.\n\nThe Republic of Indonesia on October 22, 1987 requested that the present Tribunal determine that advance payments for these proceedings should be apportioned in their entirety to Amco until the outstanding award, and interest claimed to be due on it had been met there form. Certain written communications from the parties ensued.\n\n294.\n\nThe parties agreed to a proposal by the President of the present Tribunal of December 1, 1987 that advance costs for a period of six months should be made on an equal basis, to allow the work of the Tribunal to commence.\n\n295.\n\nOn February 1, 1988 the Tribunal heard oral submissions of the parties on this matter. On February 8, 1988 the Tribunal issued a reasoned Ruling rejecting Indonesia's application for the allocation of advance costs solely to Amco. Paragraph 15 of that Ruling stated:\n\n\"The Tribunal, without taking any present position itself, notes for the record that Amco, in its communication of January 20, 1988, \"concede[s] that, as a matter of fairness, the present Tribunal should be permitted to set off against any award that it makes in [Amco's] favour any costs then owing by [Amco] to Indonesia relating to the annulment Decision.\"\n\nBasing itself on this concession, the Tribunal now decides that the sum of US$128,363.80 which includes interest of 6% from May 16, 1986, will be set off against the sum of US$2,696,330.00 it has awarded to Amco as damages.\n\nFor the above stated reasons;\n\nTHE TRIBUNAL DECIDES AS FOLLOWS:\n\n(1) the Republic of Indonesia shall pay to Amco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development Limited and P.T. Amco Indonesia, jointly (\"The Claimants\"), the sum of two million five hundred and sixty-seven thousand and nine hundred and sixty-six US dollars and twenty cents (US$2,567,966.20) with interest on this amount at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum from the date of the Award until the date of effective payment. The above sum includes a set off of one hundred and twenty-eight thousand and three hundred and sixty-three US dollars and eighty cents (US$128,363.80) for the amount including interest owed by the Claimants for their share of the costs of the Annulment Proceedings referred to in paragraph 295.\n\n(2) The amounts due from the Republic of Indonesia shall be paid to the Claimants outside of Indonesia.\n\n(3) The Republic of Indonesia's counterclaims are rejected.\n\n(4) Each party shall bear the fees and expenses it incurred for the preparation and presentation of its case.\n\n(5) Each party shall bear one half of the arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses and of the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.\n\nDone in Copenhagen, and dated this thirty-first day of May 1990"}, {"Title": "Decision on Supplemental Decisions and Rectification", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "1990-10-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Supplemental Decisions and Rectification\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n[1].\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the Request for Supplemental Decisions and Rectifications submitted by Amco on 6 August 1990: and the Memorandum submitted by Indonesia on 14 August 1990.\n\n[2].\n\nAmco's Request was based on Article 49 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 49 of the Arbitration Rules. It called for decisions on specified questions which the Tribunal was said to have omitted to decide. It also asked for the rectification of matters identified as clerical, arithmetical or similar errors.\n\n[3].\n\nAmco claimed that the Tribunal omitted to decide certain questions relating to the following: (1) Rate of Exchange. (2) 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement. (3) Aeropacific Depreciation. (4) Net Cash Flow, (5) 1980 Inflation Rate, (6) 1990-99 Discount Rate. (7) Ramada. Amco also requested that clerical, arithmetical or similar errors be rectified in respect of the first six matters above-listed.\n\n[4].\n\nThe Tribunal decides as follows, in relation to each of the matters:\n\n(1) *Rate of Exchange*\n----------------------\n\n[5].\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal had affirmed that the applicable date for converting to US Dollars any damage expresses in rupiahs is the date that the damage occurred. The Tribunal has made clear in its Award that what was lost was a share in a stream of profit. The damage was necessarily year by year damage. At paragraphs 250-253 of its Aware of 5 June 1990, the Tribunal explained the basis of the year by year exchange rate to be applied in converting rupiahs to US dollars for purposes calculating damages.\n\n[6].\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s decision was fully compatible with the *res judicata* refer.. to by Amco. There has thus been no decision that the Tribunal has omitted to take; nor any clerical, arithmetical or similar error that must be rectified\n\n(2) *1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement*\n-----------------------------------\n\n[7].\n\nThe Tribunal has made it clear in its Decision on Jurisdiction (paras 13 and 14) that the *ad hoc* Committee had annulled the First Tribunal\u2019s findings on the amount of damages. Matters going to the amount of damages, including interpretation of relevant agreement between the parties, were thus for reargument before this Tribunal. Amco and Indonesia availed themselves of this opportunity, both in relation to the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement and otherwise. There is thus no question under this head that the Tribunal omitted to decide; nor any clerical, arithmetical or similar that must be rectified.\n\n(3) *Aeropacific Depreciation*\n------------------------------\n\n[8].\n\nAt paragraph 221 of the Award, the Tribunal stated that the net book value of assets transferred to Amco under the Amco/Aeropacific Settlement Agreement of March 29, 1980(0. Exh. 18) was Rp. 421,451,054. This was the amount that appeared in the 1978 audited financial statements of Aeropacific (Cl. Exh. 61. schedule II. p. 23, vol. II. Previously Filed Cl. Docs) and at pp. 70 and 80 of Amco\u2019s Memorial.\n\n[9].\n\nThe Table A2 of the Memorial uses the higher figure of Rp. 642,705,992. Mr Mathias, testifying for Indonesia on 22 September 1989. explained that the upward adjustment would have been made by Pannell. Kerr. Forster to take into account market inflation and the depreciation of the rupiah against the dollar between 1978 and 1980. The Tribunal, finding this unusual accounting, as Mr Mathias himself indicated, has preferred to rely on the figure at pp. 70 and 80 of Amco\u2019s Memorial.\n\n[10].\n\nHowever, in column 7 of the table appearing at p. 170 of the Award, depreciation figures were used which were based on a larger net book value of Rp. 625,730,000 (value of the assets as of 9 July 1980 rather than as of 1 April 1980).\n\n[11].\n\nThere has been no decision that the Tribunal has omitted to take; however, a clerical, arithmetical or similar error has been committed that must be rectified.\n\n[12].\n\nColumn 7 of the tables appearing at pages 170 and 171 must accordingly be changed on the basis of the depreciation of Aeropacific assets totalling of Rp. 421,451,054.\n\n[13].\n\nThis results in a number of changes in the following columns in those tables. Therefore, new pages 170 and 171 are attached making the appropriate consequential changes.\n\n[14].\n\nThe first decision under the Award (pp. 176-7) is amended accordingly to read:\n\n(1) The Republic of Indonesia shall pay to Amco Asia Corporation. Pan American Development Limited and P.T. Amco Indonesia, jointly (\"the Claimants\"), the sum of two million six hundred and seventy-seven thousand and one hundred and twenty six US dollars and twenty cents (US S2,677,126.20) with the interest on this amount at the rate of six per cent (6 %) per annum from the date of the Award until the date of effective payment. The above sum includes a set off of one hundred and twenty-eight thousand and three hundred and sixty-three US dollars and eighty cents (US $128,363.80) for the amount including interest owed by the Claimants for their share of the costs of the Annulment Proceedings referred to in paragraph 295.\n\n(4) *Net Cash Flow*\n-------------------\n\n[15].\n\nIn its Award the Tribunal rejected Amco\u2019s claim \"that it was entitled to the Hotel cash flow, less PT Wisma\u2019s profit share\" (paras 223-4). The parties\u2019 entitlement was to their agreed share of the profits and not to the cash flow. That is reflected in the Tribunal\u2019s findings and in the accompanying figures. There has thus been no decision that the Tribunal has omitted to take; nor any clerical, arithmetical or similar error that must be rectified.\n\n(5) *1980 Inflation Rate*\n-------------------------\n\n[16].\n\nIn its Award the Tribunal has clearly stated why it has applied the actual year by year average inflation rate between 1980 and 1990. In identifying the actual figure, the Tribunal has applied the best neutral data available rather than either of two contending figures of the parties.\n\n[17].\n\nThere is no decision that the Tribunal has omitted to take; nor any clerical, mathematical or similar error that must be rectified.\n\n(6) *1990-99 Discount Rate*\n---------------------------\n\n[18].\n\nThe discount rate technique adopted by the Tribunal necessarily entailed the decision that a rupiah inflation rate was to be used in discounting future dollars to present values. There is no decision that the Tribunal has omitted to take: nor any clerical mathematical or similar error that must be rectified.\n\n(7) *Ramada*\n------------\n\n[19].\n\nAs has already been stated, the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction. held that matters going to the amount of damages were open to reargument Both Amco and Indonesia availed themselves of this opportunity, in respect of the matters relating to Ramada and otherwise.\n\n[20].\n\nThere is thus no decision under this heading that the Tribunal omitted to take."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Applications for Annulment of the 1990 Award and the 1990 Supplemental Award", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "1992-12-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Applications for Annulment of the 1990 Award and the 1990 Supplemental Award\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**PART ONE - PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS AND ISSUES BEFORE THE AD HOC COMMITTEE**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n---------------\n\n1.01.\n\nThe issues before the current Ad Hoc Committee relate to two Applications for Annulment of the AWARD of June 5, 1990, filed by the Parties to the present proceedings and an Application for Annulment of the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD of October 17,1990, filed by the Respondent, the Republic of INDONESIA (\"INDONESIA\").\n\nA. THE APPLICATION BY INDONESIA FOR ANNULMENT OF THE AWARD OF JUNE 5, 1990\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.02.\n\nOn October 3, 1990, within 120 days after the date of the AWARD of June 5, 1990, (\"SECOND AWARD\"), INDONESIA filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"), an Application for Annulment of the above-mentioned AWARD pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID CONVENTION (the \"CONVENTION\") and Rule 50 of the ICSID ARBITRATION RULES (\"ARBITRATION RULES\").\n\n1.03.\n\nThe grounds for INDONESIA\u2019S request for Annulment are those specified in Article 52 (1) of the CONVENTION, namely,\n\n(1) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its power (Sub-paragraph (b));\n\n(2) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Sub-paragraph (d)); and\n\n(3) that the AWARD has failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Subparagraph (e)).\n\n(See Application of the Republic of Indonesia for Annulment of the AWARD dated June 5, 1990, filed on October 3, 1990, page 1)\n\n1.04.\n\nIn particular and on either one or the combination of any two or all three of the grounds mentioned above, INDONESIA\u2019S Application seeks annulment of three findings by the Tribunal in the SECOND AWARD, namely,\n\n(1) The finding that INDONESIA was liable under the new theory of a regulatory denial of justice based on a \"generally tainted background\" surrounding the revocation of AMCO\u2019S license;\n\n(2) The finding that the substantive validity of the revocation need not be decided in order to determine AMCO\u2019S entitlement to damages; and\n\n(3) The findings that AMCO was entitled to an award of damages of its full contractual expectation based on a denial of justice.\n\n(Ibid., IV, pages 27-38)\n\n1.05.\n\nINDONESIA also submitted as additional grounds for annulment under Article 52 (1) (b) and (e) of the CONVENTION that \"the Second Tribunal failed to state reasons and refused to consider under Indonesian Law : Indonesia\u2019s tax fraud counterclaim; Indonesia\u2019s tax concessions counterclaim; and Indonesia\u2019s customs concessions counterclaim\".\n\n(Ibid., IV, page 39)\n\n1.06.\n\nAs such, INDONESIA\u2019S Application for annulment seeks total nullification of the SECOND AWARD in respect of the three findings listed in paragraph 1.04 above.\n\n(Ibid., VII Conclusion, page 41)\n\nB. THE APPLICATION BY AMCO FOR ANNULMENT IN PART OF THE AWARD OF JUNE 5, 1990\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.07.\n\nOn October 3, 1990, the very same day on which INDONESIA\u2019S Application for Annulment was filed, AMCO ASIA CORPORATION (\"AMCO ASIA\"), a company incorporated in Delaware, U.S.A., PAN AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT LIMITED (\"PAN AMERICAN\") a Hong Kong company and P.T. AMCO INDONESIA (\"P.T. AMCO\"), a company established under the aegis of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law of Indonesia, (collectively \"AMCO\") as claimants in the present dispute, also filed with the Secretary-General of ICSID an Application to annul the part of the SECOND AWARD relating to damages, including the ruling on relitigation of the quantification of damages, and \"to reinstate the amount of damages granted in the earlier award of the Goldman Tribunal dated November 19, 1984 (\"the FIRST AWARD\")\".\n\n(See AMCO\u2019S APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT IN PART, October 3, 1990, pages 1-7)\n\n1.08.\n\nAMCO\u2019S Application for Annulment in Part of the SECOND AWARD was based on Article 52 (1) (b) of the CONVENTION on the ground that the Tribunal (i.e., the SECOND TRIBUNAL or, as sometimes used by the PARTIES, the HIGGINS TRIBUNAL) manifestly exceeded its power by relitigating the nature of the prejudice suffered by AMCO and the quantification of damages due AMCO for INDONESIA\u2019S wrongful actions. In particular, AMCO stated\n\n(1) that the SECOND TRIBUNAL manifestly exceeded its power when it\n\n(a) relitigated the issue of what prejudice AMCO suffered from the wrongful army and police actions on March 31/April 1, 1980, and\n\n(b) determined, contrary to the FIRST TRIBUNAL, that the only prejudice which AMCO suffered was a \"general disturbance\", not loss of future income; and\n\n(2) that the SECOND TRIBUNAL manifestly exceeded its power when it relitigated the issue of the aggregate amount of damages due AMCO for the illegal army and police actions on April 1, 1980 and the illegal revocation of AMCO\u2019S investment authorization on July 9, 1980.\n\n(Ibid., I and II, pages 8-17)\n\n1.09.\n\nAMCO submitted in its Application for Annulment in Part that \"the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S quantification of damages was res judicata \", that \"the Higgins Tribunal\u2019s different quantification of damages was ultra petita \": and therefore, that \"the amount of damages awarded by the Higgins Tribunal should be annulled and the amount awarded by the Goldman Tribunal should be restored\".\n\n(Ibid., page 17)\n\nC. THE APPLICATION BY INDONESIA FOR ANNULMENT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD OF OCTOBER 17, 1990\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.10.\n\nOn February 14, 1991, within 120 days after the date on which the Supplemental Decisions and Rectification (\"SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD\") was rendered, i.e., certified and dispatched by the Secretary-General, on October 17, 1990, INDONESIA filed with the ICSID Secretariat its Application for Annulment of the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD of October 17, 1990 by the SECOND TRIBUNAL.\n\n(See Application of the Republic of Indonesia for Annulment of the Supplemental Award rendered on October 17, 1990, February 14, 1991, pages 1-13)\n\n1.11.\n\nThe grounds for annulment of the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD of October 17, 1990 were specified by INDONESIA in terms of Article 52 (1) of the CONVENTION as follows :\n\n(1) \"The Second Tribunal manifestly exceeded its power\" (Sub-paragraph (b));\n\n(2) \"The Second Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure\" (Sub-paragraph (d)); and\n\n(3) \"The Supplemental Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based\" (Sub-paragraph (e)).\n\n(Ibid., IV, pages 16-19)\n\n1.12.\n\nIn particular, INDONESIA supported its grounds for annulment as follows :\n\n(1) by reconsidering and changing its decision on an issue where it neither omitted to decide nor corrected a clerical error, the Tribunal acted beyond the scope of its power under Article 49 (2) of the CONVENTION, thereby manifestly exceeded its power;\n\n(2) by twice seriously departing from a fundamental rule of procedure :\n\n(a) first, by failing to give notice to INDONESIA; and\n\n(b) second, by failing to provide INDONESIA with the opportunity to be heard on the merits of the substance of AMCO\u2019S Rule 49 request, thereby denying equality of the Parties; and thereby seriously departing from a fundamental rule of procedure; and\n\n(3) by failing to demonstrate the inadvertent quality of the error in the decision it sought to rectify, and by rationalizing the superiority of its new position over its old one, based on questionable accounting practice, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD was based.\n\n(Ibid., III and IV, pages 14-19)\n\n1.13.\n\nINDONESIA further requested that its Application for Annulment of the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD, \"be consolidated with and considered by the same Ad Hoc Committee simultaneously with its 3 October 1990 Application for Annulment of the SECOND AWARD\",\n\n(Ibid., VI. Conclusion, pages 19-20)\n\nD. CONCURRENCE OF APPLICATIONS FOR ANNULMENT OF THE AWARD AND SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD OF THE SAME TRIBUNAL\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Finality of ICSID Awards\n----------------------------\n\n1.14.\n\nIt is important to note at this juncture that within the ICSID system of Arbitration there is no appeal or any other remedy against an award except those provided for in the CONVENTION. An ICSID award is thus final and binding on the parties. The only post-award procedures provided for in the CONVENTION are confined to the remedies available under Articles 49 to 52 of the CONVENTION and can only be exercised within the framework of the CONVENTION and in accordance with its provisions, namely, addition to and correction of the award (Article 49), interpretation (Article 50), revision (Article 51) and annulment (Article 52). The award is therefore final in the sense that it is not subject to judicial review in national jurisdictions nor to any review on the merits within the autonomous ICSID system. It is not final in the sense that it is open to being supplemented or rectified, interpreted or annulled. It is to this last remedy that both Parties, INDONESIA as well as AMCO, are having recourse in the present annulment proceedings.\n\n(b) Nature of annulment proceedings and of the remedy sought by the Parties\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.15.\n\nAn annulment proceeding in the ICSID system of Arbitration is in effect a proceeding instituted against the arbitral Award. It is based exclusively on one or more of the five grounds enumerated ex pressis verbis in Article 52 (1) of the CONVENTION which serves to delimit the scope of the authority vested in the Arbitral Tribunal. In this sense, an application for annulment by one Party is directed against the AWARD and indirectly the Tribunal and not necessarily against the other Party. Thus, it is conceivable, as it occurs occasionally, that the award rendered by an Arbitral Tribunal may be subject to attack through the annulment process initiated by both Parties to the original proceeding. Thus, in the present annulment proceedings, both INDONESIA and AMCO appeared before the Ad Hoc Committee as complainants against the decisions and findings of the AWARD, including the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD, rendered by the SECOND TRIBUNAL.\n\n1.16.\n\nTrue it is that in the present annulment proceedings, both INDONESIA and AMCO expressed their disagreement with the SECOND AWARD. The grounds for their respective applications for annulment may be broadly similar in several areas, if not indeed identical in any respect, but the scope of their request for annulment may vary in diametrically opposite direction. Thus, INDONESIA is seeking total annulment of the SECOND AWARD subject to minor exceptions (see infra, Paragraph 4.02 IL), while AMCO is merely requesting its partial annulment and there was a distinct possibility at an earlier stage of the proceedings that, had the Respondent decided to withdraw its Applications for Annulment, the Claimants would have been prepared likewise to withdraw their request for partial annulment. The fact that both Parties request the total or partial annulment of an ICSID AWARD does not necessarily imply that the AWARD is to be annulled to the extent requested by both Parties. Although the Parties could effectively agree to submit their dispute to an ICSID Arbitration and conversely also to withdraw the dispute thus submitted from pending proceedings, their agreement on the extent to which an otherwise valid ICSID AWARD is to be annulled will not automatically entail the effect of nullification of the AWARD even to the limited extent mutually desired by the Parties.\n\n1.17.\n\nThe remedy of annulment requested by either or by both Parties under Article 52 of the CONVENTION is essentially limited by the grounds expressly enumerated in paragraph 1, on which an application for annulment may be made. This limitation is further confirmed by Article 53 (1) by the exclusion of review of the merits of the Awards, Annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision. An Ad Hoc Committee may not in fact review or reverse an ICSID award on the merits under the guise of annulment under Article 52. The fact that annulment is in this sense a limited and extraordinary remedy does not require an Ad Hoc Committee to construe the terms of Article 52 (1), i.e., the grounds for annulment, either liberally because it is the only remedy obtainable against an unjust Award or restrictively to ensure finality and unassailability of an ICSID Award. In the view of the Committee, Article 52 (1) should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose : this precludes its application to the review of an Award on the merits and in a converse case excludes an unwarranted refusal to give full effect to it within the limited but significant area for which it was intended,\n\n1.18.\n\nThe Committee notes that consistently with the foregoing an Ad Hoc Committee is required to give full effect to the wording of Article 52 (1) which defines and delimits the grounds for annulment. Thus, Article 52 (1) (b) does not authorize a sanction against every excess of power by a Tribunal but provides that the excess of power be manifest which essentially limits the freedom of appreciation of Ad Hoc Committees as to whether the Tribunal has exceeded its power. Under sub-paragraph (d), not every departure from a rule of procedure will suffice to warrant annulment; the departure has to be serious and the rule of procedure fundamental to justify nullification by an Ad Hoc Committee. Again, Article 52 (1) (e) requires that the Tribunal gives reasons on which its decision is based. It does not require that the reasons be adequate or sufficient, while inconsistent reasons or frivolous reasons would be tantamount to absence of reasons. To permit freedom of appreciation by an Ad Hoc Committee of the quality of the reasons given by the Tribunal is to confer on Ad Hoc Committees considerably wider power than otherwise intended by the CONVENTION, including appellate jurisdiction and the power of review, explicitly excluded by the wording of Article 53 (1). It is incumbent upon Ad Hoc Committees to resist the temptation to rectify incorrect decisions or to annul unjust awards.\n\n(c) Request for Total and Partial Annulment of the Award before the Ad Hoc Committees\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.19.\n\nArticle 52 (3) of the CONVENTION authorizes an Ad Hoc Committee \"to annul the award or any part thereof on any of the grounds set forth in paragraph (1)\". Subject to further consideration of the issues relating to res judicata, the Committee is empowered to annul the SECOND AWARD or any part thereof in its examination of INDONESIA\u2019S Application for Annulment of the AWARD as a whole. As for AMCO\u2019S Application for Annulment in Part, the COMMITTEE notes that the Ad Hoc Committee may annul the Award only pursuant to AMCO\u2019S request and within the scope of that request, unless by necessary implication annulment of the part requested clearly entails nullification of other portions of the AWARD.\n\n1.20.\n\nThe authority provided by Article 52 (3) to enable an Ad Hoc Committee to annul the Award or any part thereof, does not imply its automatic exercise whenever and wherever one of the Parties has established one of the grounds for annulment. An Ad Hoc Committee retains a measure of discretion in its ruling on applications for annulment. This is clearly implied in the CONVENTION through the use of terms, such as \"manifest\", \"serious\" and \"fundamental\". This discretion is not unlimited and should not be exercised to the point of defeating the object and purpose of the remedy of annulment. The Ad Hoc Committee may refuse to exercise its authority to annul an Award if and when annulment is clearly not needed to remedy procedural injustice and annulment would unwarrantably erode the binding force and finality of ICSID Awards.\n\n1.21.\n\nSuch consideration, however, should not be understood as subjecting annulment proceedings to constraints caused by the need to protect the ICSID system. An argument has recently been advanced to the effect that the possibility of a series of annulments of ICSID Awards followed by resubmission of the disputes resulting in Awards open to yet further annulment proceedings might impair the effectiveness and serviceability of ICSID as an international institution for settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States. The Committee has been constantly reminded of the dangerous possibility of a prolonged series of unending proceedings. This argument falsely assumes, however, that annulments are necessarily the result of overly strict standards applied by Ad Hoc Committees. It overlooks the possibility that the frequencies of such annulments may reflect neglect by Parties, counsel and arbitrators alike of the requirement flowing from the specificity of ICSID arbitration as defined by the CONVENTION and the ARBITRATION RULES. A purely statistical approach appears unwarranted as an evaluation of ICSID\u2019s effectiveness and serviceability.\n\nII. BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT PROCEEDINGS\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA. REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION\n--------------------------\n\n2.01.\n\nOn 15 January 1981, AMCO ASIA CORPORATION (\"AMCO ASIA\"), PAN AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT LIMITED (\"PAN AMERICAN\") and P.T. AMCO INDONESIA (\"P.T. AMCO\") collectively AMCO, the Claimants, filed with the Secretary-General of ICSID a REQUEST for ARBITRATION against the Republic of INDONESIA (\"INDONESIA\"), the Respondent. The REQUEST was submitted pursuant to Article 36 of the CONVENTION and was registered by the Secretary-General on the same date.\n\nB. THE PARTIES TO THE DISPUTE\n-----------------------------\n\n2.02.\n\nThe PARTIES to the Dispute, as listed in the Title of the ICSID Arbitration Case, include :\n\na. On the CLAIMANTS Side\n\n(1) AMCO ASIA or Amco Asia Corporation, a company incorporated in Delaware, U.S.A., the initial foreign investor in this case;\n\n(2) PAN AMERICAN or Pan American Development Ltd., a Hong Kong company, a subsequently disclosed principal on whose behalf AMCO ASIA initiated negotiations and concluded a Lease and Management Agreement regarding a joint-venture, the Hotel Kartika Plaza Project, in 1968 with P.T. WISMA KARTIKA (\"P.T. WISMA\"), the lessor, owner of the land and premises, an enterprise whose shares were acquired by INKOPAD, a cooperative set up under Indonesian law for the welfare of Indonesian Army personnel. P.T. WISMA was the successor to P.T. BLUNTAS, an enterprise created in 1964 by the Bank of Indonesia and an Indonesian private investor to develop an apartment/hotel complex on a specified site in Jakarta, now known as HOTEL KARTIKA PLAZA COMPLEX.\n\n(3) P.T. AMCO or P.T. AMCO Indonesia, a company established by AMCO ASIA with the permission granted by the Minister of Public Works on July 29, 1968, within the framework of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. P.T. AMCO was set up in accordance with the amended application submitted by AMCO ASIA, which included an arbitration clause submitting any dispute between P.T. AMCO and the Government of Indonesia to ICSID Arbitration. The Articles of Association of P.T. AMCO were approved by the Minister of Justice on January 25, 1969, and registered with the Central Jakarta District Court on January 29, 1969, and published in Supplement No. 27 to the State Gazette of Indonesia No. 41 of 1969.\n\n(See the FIRST AWARD, para 40)\n\nb. On the RESPONDENT Side\n\nTHE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA to which alleged actions and omissions have been attributed which engaged its responsibility. The actors or agencies whose acts have been imputed to the Indonesian Government include THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT COORDINATING BOARD or \"BODAN KOORDINASI PENANNANAM MODAL\" (BKPM) whose decision to revoke P.T. AMCO\u2019S license to operate as an authorized investor was alleged to have been reached in contravention of certain procedural requirements.\n\nC. EVENTS LEADING TO THE DISPUTE\n--------------------------------\n\n2.03.\n\nIn the current annulment proceedings, it is not necessary for the COMMITTEE to recount in detail all the facts relating to the merits of the dispute. The AWARD on the merits rendered by the FIRST TRIBUNAL on November 20, 1984 (the \"FIRST AWARD\") (1 International Arbitration Report (1986), 601) may be referred to for a fuller account of the facts of the case, of which a summarized version is contained in the AWARD on the merits rendered by the SECOND TRIBUNAL on June 5, 1990 (the \"SECOND AWARD\"), against which Applications for Annulment have been filed by the PARTIES to the dispute. Suffice it therefore to list some of the major events leading to the dispute.\n\na. The Lease and Management Agreements and the Profit-Sharing Agreement\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.04.\n\nOn April 22, 1968, a Lease and Management Agreement was concluded between AMCO ASIA and P.T. WISMA, successor to P.T. BLUNTAS, whereby AMCO ASIA was to invest up to the sum of US$ 4,000,000.00 overall to complete the original construction of a Hotel/Apartment left incomplete with up to US$ 3,000,000.00 being used for an additional six-storey building. This Lease and Management Agreement was to last 19 years for both structures. The profit-sharing formula and procedures were contained in an agreed addendum signed on May 18, 1968.\n\n2.05.\n\nOn May 6, 1968, AMCO ASIA submitted to the Government of Indonesia an application to establish P.T. AMCO under the aegis of the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. The application underwent various amendments. In the amended application, it was proposed that there be an exemption from corporate taxes and dividend taxes for three years. P.T. AMCO was to be exempt from import duties with respect to capital goods, including spares and parts,if P.T. AMCO used \"its own foreign exchange or supplemental foreign exchange in the limits set in the Government regulations in force\". The application also included an arbitration clause which referred any dispute between P.T. AMCO and the Government of Indonesia to ICSID. On July 29, 1968, AMCO ASIA was granted permission by the Minister of Public Works to establish P.T. AMCO within the framework of the 1967 investment legislation. This permission or license in effect authorized P.T. AMCO to operate as investor under the new investment law with the benefit of tax concessions and exemption from certain import duties (FIRST AWARD, Paragraphs 21-32).\n\n2.06.\n\nOn January 24, 1969, P.T. WISMA extended the terms of the Lease and Management Agreement to 30 years. On August 22, 1969, P.T. AMCO concluded a Sub-Lease Agreement letting other persons and airlines manage and operate HOTEL KARTIKA PLAZA in exchange for credit facilities to enable P.T. AMCO to complete the construction of the Hotel. On October 13, 1970, a second Sub-Lease Agreement was concluded between P.T. AMCO and Aeropacific Hotel Association (\"AEROPACIFIC\"), a partnership consisting of the same sublessees as those of August 22, 1969. P.T. WISMA and AMCO ASIA agreed in writing to respect the terms of the Sub-Lease Agreements assigning the responsibilities to AEROPACIFIC to secure a loan from Algemeine Bank Nederland N.V. (\"ABN\") of US$ 1,000,000.00 to complete construction of the hotel. The second Sub-Lease continued until June 1978 when relations between P.T. AMCO and AEROPACIFIC deteriorated, ending in arbitration and resolution by agreement of March 29, 1980. (FIRST AWARD, para 77).\n\n2.07.\n\nIn 1971, P.T. AMCO disclosed the fact that it had entered into the 1968 Lease and Management Agreement with P.T. WISMA as agent and nominee for and on behalf of PAN AMERICAN. Transfer of a portion of AMCO ASIA\u2019S shares in P.T. AMCO to PAN AMERICAN was approved on May 1, 1972. (Ibid., paras 41-45).\n\n2.08.\n\nAfter the legal disagreement between P.T. AMCO and AEROPACIFIC during the few months of 1978, INKOPAD undertook the management of the Hotel from June 1978, and on October 8, 1978, authorized P.T. WISMA to negotiate and conclude with P.T. AMCO a \"Profit-Sharing Agreement for the Management of KARTIKA PLAZA Land and Building with all its contents\". (Ibid., paras 77-78). P.T. AMCO resumed management of the Hotel after signing the Agreement.\n\n2.09.\n\nOn July 4, 1979, P.T. AMCO concluded with RAMADA INNS INC. and RAMADA INTERNATIONAL INC. respectively a License Agreement and an International Management Agreement. From November 1979 to March 31, 1980, P.T. WISMA and P.T. AMCO were in disagreement on several matters, particularly concerning the amounts due from P.T. AMCO to P.T. WISMA under the Profit-Sharing Management Agreement of 1978. Failing to agree on the figures due, P.T. WISMA gave two successive notices, on March 15 and March 30, 1980, after which the management of the KARTIKA PLAZA building was to be conducted by P.T. WISMA as the owner. On March 31, 1980, P.T. WISMA notified all Managers and Department Heads that henceforth the management of the Hotel was to be assumed by a Management Council established by P.T. WISMA.\n\nb. The Events of March 31/April 1, 1980 and Following\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n2.10.\n\nThe Claimants alleged that, on March 31/April 1, 1980, the Indonesian Government \"wrongfully seized\" control and management of the Hotel from P.T. AMCO in what was described by AMCO as \"an armed, military action\" (Request for Arbitration by AMCO, page 12, Paragraph 30 and Statement of Fact and Law, page 7, Paragraph 11).\n\n2.11.\n\nThe Respondent, INDONESIA, contended that any military or public assistance was only directed to supporting the legal right of P.T. Wisma to control the hotel and was not a seizure of the hotel by the Government (SECOND AWARD, Paragraph 15).\n\n2.12.\n\nThe General Manager of the Hotel testified that a number of Indonesian Armed Forces personnel (\"up to perhaps two dozens\") including army and police personnel, were found present in or about the building, located in various positions including the lobby, corridors and guarding certain stairways and offices (FIRST AWARD, Paragraphs 99100). The FIRST TRIBUNAL noted that \"some members of the Armed Forces remained in the Hotel until October, 1980, at which time they were no longer required and they returned to their respective units\". (Ibid., Paragraph 109).\n\nc. The Revocation of the Investment License\n-------------------------------------------\n\n2.13.\n\nAs noted by the SECOND TRIBUNAL (SECOND AWARD, Paragraph 12) after the events of March 31/April 1, 1980, P.T. WISMA took over control and management of the KARTIKA PLAZA and reported certain information to BKPM, a Government agency responsible for examining applications by foreign investors, making recommendations to the Government and supervising the implementation of approved investments. After holding meetings with, and receiving further information from, representatives of P.T. WISMA, Mr. USMAN of BKPM recommended in his report that P.T. AMCO\u2019S license be reviewed. On May 12, 1980, the Chairman of BKPM requested termination of the license. This request was approved by the President of Indonesia, and on July 9, 1980, BKPM revoked P.T. AMCO\u2019S license.\n\n2.14.\n\nThe Claimants have alleged that the Respondent, having seized AMCO\u2019S investment, unjustifiably cancelled its investment license. INDONESIA has denied AMCO\u2019S claim that the cancellation of the investment license was unlawful. In a Counter-Claim, INDONESIA has asserted that as the cancellation of the investment license was justified, P.T. AMCO was obliged to pay all monies that should have been paid as taxes and import duties (FIRST AWARD, Paragraph 283).\n\nD. EARLIER PROCEEDINGS\n----------------------\n\n(1) THE AWARD OF THE FIRST TRIBUNAL\n-----------------------------------\n\n2.15.\n\nThe FIRST TRIBUNAL, after reviewing the conflicting evidence regarding the presence of military personnel at the Hotel during March 31 and April 1, 1980 and thereafter, declared that it was satisfied that \"There was a taking of the claimants\u2019 rights to the control and management of the land and all the KARTIKA PLAZA building\" and that \"a number of army and police personnel were present... and by their very presence assisted with the successful seizure from P.T. AMCO of the exercise of its lease and management rights (FIRST AWARD, Paragraph 155). The First Tribunal found on the basis of the proven actions and omissions of the army/police personnel that the acts of P.T. WISMA constituted illegal self-help and the assistance to these acts given to P.T. WISMA and the lack of protection afforded to P.T. AMCO, a foreign investor in Indonesia, by the Army/Police was an \"international wrong attributable to the Republic\" (FIRST AWARD, Paragraph 178).\n\n2.16.\n\nBefore the FIRST TRIBUNAL, P.T. AMCO also claimed that INDONESIA had seized its investment in the building and management of the KARTIKA PLAZA Complex and then cancelled its investment license. In its counterclaim, INDONESIA asserted that, as the cancellation of the investment license was justified, being lawful both procedurally and substantively, P.T. AMCO was obliged to return tax concessions and other privileges granted by INDONESIA (FIRST AWARD, Paragraphs 142-146). In its AWARD dated November 20, 1984, the FIRST TRIBUNAL rejected INDONESIA\u2019S counterclaim and found for the claimants, ordering the Respondent to pay the sum of US$ 3,200,000.00 with interest to be paid outside INDONESIA.\n\n(2) THE DECISION OF THE FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\n----------------------------------------------\n\n2.17.\n\nOn March 18, 1985, within 120 days after the date of the FIRST AWARD was rendered, INDONESIA filed an application in writing to the Secretary-General of ICSID requesting annulment of the AWARD of November 20, 1984 under Article 52 of the CONVENTION. An Ad Hoc Committee (THE FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE) was set up pursuant to Article 52 (3) of the CONVENTION. The FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE ordered and subsequently confirmed a stay of enforcement of the FIRST AWARD upon INDONESIA\u2019S furnishing of an irrevocable and unconditional bank guarantee issued on July 3, 1985.\n\n2.18.\n\nOn May 16, 1986, following a series of exchanges of written pleadings and oral hearings in 1985 and 1986, the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE, presided by Ignaz Seidl-Hohenveldern, decided to annul the FIRST AWARD \"as a whole for the reasons and with the qualifications set out above\". (1 International Arbitration Report (1986) 649); 25 International Legal Materials (1986) 1439, final para). The annulment did not extend to the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S findings on the illegality of the action of the army and police personnel on March 31/April 1, 1980. It extended to the findings on the duration of such illegality and on the amount of indemnity due on that account (Decision of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE, p. 47), thereby demarcating the issues which were unannulled by the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE, and thus constituted \" res judicata \" for the dispute as between the PARTIES. The bank guarantee furnished by INDONESIA expired in accordance with its terms.\n\n2.19.\n\nWith the question of \"illegality\" of the action by the army and police personnel of Indonesia on March 31/April 1, 1980 left unannulled, the finding of the FIRST TRIBUNAL that AMCO is entitled to damages from INDONESIA is \" res judicata \". However, the damage caused to P.T. AMCO by the actions of the army and police personnel came to an end on the day of the revocation of P.T. AMCO\u2019S license, on July 9, 1980. Consequently, the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE annulled the award of damages to P.T. AMCO in paras 280-281 of the FIRST AWARD for the period before July 9, 1980 (Decision of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE, paras 108-110). The First Ad Hoc Committee, not being an appellate tribunal, had no authority to determine the amount of damages due for the action by the army and police personnel for March 31/April 1, 1980, roughly a hundred days between the so-called \"take-over\" and \"license cancellation\". As a result, the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S findings on the amount of damages were annulled as a whole.\n\n(3) RESUBMSSION OF THE DISPUTE FOLLOWED BY THE AWARD AND SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD OF THE SECOND TRIBUNAL\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Request for Resubmission of the Dispute\n-------------------------------------------\n\n2.20.\n\nOn May 12, 1987, AMCO submitted to the Secretary-General of ICSID a Request for Resubmission of the Dispute pursuant to Article 52 (6) of the CONVENTION and Rule 55 of the ARBITRATION RULES. INDONESIA likewise on June 12, 1987 submitted a Request for Resubmission of the Dispute. A Second Tribunal was constituted on October 20, 1987. On December 21, 1987, the SECOND TRIBUNAL issued a Provisional Indication as to what determinations of the FIRST TRIBUNAL had been annulled by the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE on May 16, 1986, and what unannulled portions of the FIRST AWARD remained res judicata. Various other jurisdictional matters were contested by the PARTIES, and following oral hearings in London on January 30 and February 1, 1988, the SECOND TRIBUNAL gave its Decision on Jurisdiction including questions of res judicata on May 10, 1988. (3 ICSID Review 166 (1988); 27 ILM (1988) 1281).\n\n(b) The SECOND AWARD\n--------------------\n\n2.21.\n\nFollowing the filing by the PARTIES of Memorial, Counter-Memorial, Reply and Rejoinder on the merits of the case and a variety of correspondence on different issues between the Parties and the Tribunal, hearings on the merits were held in Washington, D.C., on September 18 to 29, 1989, and an award was rendered by the SECOND TRIBUNAL, on May 31, 1990. This award which is the SECOND AWARD in this case was received and dispatched by ICSID to the PARTIES on June 5, 1990. It is this AWARD of June 5, 1990 against which INDONESIA and AMCO, each in turn and on separate grounds, have respectively requested total and partial annulment, the requests now pending before the current AD HOC COMMITTEE.\n\n2.22.\n\nIn its conclusion following Paragraph 295 of the SECOND AWARD, the SECOND TRIBUNAL decided as follows :\n\n\"(1) The Republic of Indonesia shall pay to Amco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development Limited and P.T. Amco Indonesia, jointly (\"The Claimants\"), the sum of two million five hundred and sixty-seven thousand and nine hundred and sixty-six U.S. dollars and twenty cents (US$ 2,567,966.20) with interest on this amount at the rate of six percent (6 %) per annum from the date of the Award until the date of effective payment. The above sum includes a set off of one hundred and twenty-eight thousand and three hundred and sixty-three U.S. dollars and eighty cents (US$ 128,363.80) for the amount including interest owed by the Claimants for their share of the costs of the Annulment Proceedings referred to in paragraph 295.\n\n\"(2) The amounts due from the Republic of Indonesia shall be paid to the Claimants outside of Indonesia.\n\n\"(3) The Republic of Indonesia\u2019s counterclaims are rejected...\"\n\n(c) The SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD\n--------------------------\n\n2.23.\n\nOn July 20, 1990, AMCO submitted a Request, registered by ICSID on August 6, 1990, for Supplemental Decisions and Rectification of the SECOND AWARD of June 5, 1990, pursuant to Article 49 of the CONVENTION and Rule 49 of the ARBITRATION RULES. AMCO claimed that the SECOND TRIBUNAL omitted to decide certain questions relating to seven matters, viz : (1) Rate of Exchange; (2) 1978 ProfitSharing Agreement; (3) Aeropacific Depreciation; (4) Net Cash Flow; (5) 1980 Inflation Rate; (6) 1990-99 Discount Rate; and (7) Ramada. AMCO further requested rectifications of clerical, arithmetical or similar errors in respect of all but the last of the above-mentioned matters.\n\n2.24.\n\nHaving considered AMCO\u2019S Request of July 20, 1990, for Supplemental Decisions and Rectification of the SECOND AWARD and a Letter concerning Jurisdiction submit ted by INDONESIA on August 14, 1990, urging the SECOND TRIBUNAL to \"decide its jurisdiction as a preliminary matter\", and without an opportunity being given to INDONESIA to address the substance of AMCO\u2019S arguments, the SECOND TRIBUNAL decided on all the seven matters submitted by AMCO in its Request of July 20, 1990, denying the existence of any omission on the part of the SECOND TRIBUNAL on all but one of the seven items raised in AMCO\u2019S July 20 Request, namely, item (3) Aeropacific De preciation, in regard to which the SECOND TRIBUNAL found a clerical, arithmetical or similar error to have been committed and proceeded to rectify it. The SECOND TRIBUNAL amended its previous Award of June 5, 1990 by new pages 170 and 171 of the SECOND AWARD incorporating consequential changes, increasing the amount of payment it ordered INDONESIA to make to AMCO from US$ 2,567,966.20 to US$ 2,677,126.20, an increase of US$ 109,160.00 (U.S. dollars one hundred nine thousand one hundred and sixty) with interest of six percent per annum, thereby amending the sum specified in operative sub-paragraph (1) of the final paragraph of its Award of June 5, 1990.\n\nIII. PROCEDURAL DEVELOPMENTS\n----------------------------\n\nA. CONSTITUTION OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE\n---------------------------------------\n\n3.01.\n\nOn January 30, 1990, the Secretary-General of ICSID notified INDONESIA and AMCO as Applicants in the present Annulment Proceedings for the Annulment of the Award of June 5, 1990, of the appointments by the Chairman of the Administrative Council and of the acceptance by the appointees constituting the new AD HOC COMMITTEE to consider the applications for annulment and partial annulment of the Award of June 5, 1990, as well as INDONESIA\u2019S application for annulment of the Supplemental Decisions and Rectification of October 17, 1990. The COMMITTEE thus constituted, consists of the following members :-\n\n(1) Professor Arghyrios A. FATOUROS of Greece;\n\n(2) Professor Dietrich SCHINDLER of Switzerland; and\n\n(3) Professor Sompong SUCHARITKUL of Thailand.\n\nB. INITIAL PROCEDURAL DECISION\n------------------------------\n\n3.02.\n\nOn February 6, 1991, the COMMITTEE conferred by telephone and elected Professor Sompong SUCHARITKUL as President of the COMMITTEE; Ms. Margrete L. STEVENS, representing the Centre serving as Secretary of the Committee. (Item (i) of the INITIAL PROCEDURAL DECISION).\n\n3.03.\n\nNoting that in its Application for Annulment of the Award, dated October 3, 1990, INDONESIA had requested a stay of enforcement of the Award pending the COMMITTEE\u2019s decision on its Application for Annulment, the COMMITTEE determined on the same day, February 6, 1991, that pursuant to Article 52 (5) of the CONVENTION, enforcement of the Award is accordingly stayed provisionally until the COMMUTEE rules on INDONESIA\u2019S request for stay of enforcement of the Award. (Item (ii) of the INITIAL PROCEDURAL DECISION).\n\n3.04.\n\nThe COMMITTEE adopted Procedural Order No. 1 (item (iii) of the INITIAL PROCEDURAL DECISION), announcing the dates and venue for Preliminary Procedural Consultation to be convened with the PARTIES at ICSID Headquarters in Washington, D.C., U.S.A., on March 1 and 2, 1991, preceded by the COMMITTEE\u2019S internal meeting on February 28, 1991. The First Session of the COMMITTEE Meeting with the PARTIES was to provide the COMMITTEE with an opportunity to review matters of procedure as well as administrative and financial matters, and in particular, as a matter of priority, to consider the request by INDONESIA for a stay of enforcement of the Award of June 5, 1990, pending the COMMITTEE\u2019S decision on the PARTIES\u2019 Applications for Annulment. At the President\u2019s request, the PARTIES were invited to submit their views on the procedural matters referred to in Rule 20 of the ARBITRATION RULES by February 15, 1991, and AMCO to submit observations (if any) on INDONESIA\u2019S request for stay of enforcement.\n\nC. PRELIMINARY PROCEDURAL CONSULTATION\n--------------------------------------\n\n(1) The Minutes of the First Session of the COMMITTEE\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n3.05.\n\nThe COMMITTEE held its First Session in Washington, D.C. on February 28, 1991. Pursuant to Rule 20 of the ARBITRATION RULES, the COMMITTEE met with the PARTIES for the first time for Preliminary Procedural Consultation on March 1 and 2, 1991. Each member of the COMMITTEE had signed the declaration in accordance with Rule 52 (2) in the form prescribed by Rule 6 (2) of the ARBITRATION RULES, and the PARTIES declared that they were satisfied that the COMMUTEE had been properly constituted, confirming that they had no objection in this regard. Having ascertained the views and submissions of the PARTIES, the COMMITTEE adopted Procedural Order No, 2. fixing the number and sequence of the written pleadings and the time limits for the presentation of the Memorials by the PARTIES by May 17, 1991; CounterMemorials by June 17, 1991; Replies (if any) by July 1, 1991; and Rejoinders (if any) by July 15, 1991. Other procedural and administrative matters were also reviewed and decisions taken thereon were recorded in the Minutes of the First Session of the COMMITEE.\n\n3.06.\n\nAt the request of INDONESIA, the President of the COMMITTEE decided by virtue of Rule 25 (2) of the ARBITRATION RULES to extend the time limits for the submission of Memorials to June 4, 1991; Counter-Memorials by July 5, 1991; Replies to July 19, 1991 (if any); and Rejoinders by August 2, 1991 (if any). (Procedural Order No. 3. San Francisco, May 14, 1991). Following INDONESIA\u2019S request for extension for the submission of its Reply, the President of the COMMITTEE by virtue of ARBITRATION RULE 25 (2) decided to extend the time limits for the submission of the remaining written pleadings by the PARTIES to July 29, 1991 for Replies (if any), and August 15, 1991 for Rejoinders (if any). (Procedural, Order No. 4, Hong Kong, July 19, 1991).\n\n(2) Interim Order No, I : REQUEST FOR A STAY OF ENFORCEMENT\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.07.\n\nAt this First Session of the COMMITTEE on March 1 and 2, 1991, each PARTY expanded its views on INDONESIA\u2019S request for a stay of enforcement of the AWARD of June 5, 1990. INDONESIA requested that the extension of the stay be without provision of security, while AMCO stated that the stay should be terminated and, if so required, INDONESIA should provide a bank guarantee. On this particular request of INDONESIA for stay of enforcement, the COMMITTEE decided on March 2, 1991, to continue stay of enforcement of the AWARD (Including the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD) on condition that \"an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee from a reputable European bank on terms and provisions approved by the President of the COMMITTEE be furnished by INDONESIA by June 17, 1991.\" (Interim Order No, I. Washington, D.C., March 2, 1991, attached as ANNEX I to the Decision of the COMMITTEE). Thus, stay of enforcement was continued upon INDONESIA\u2019S furnishing of the bank guarantee on terms and provisions approved by the President of the COMMITTEE on June 14, 1991.\n\n(3) Ruling on, Allocation of Advance payments\n---------------------------------------------\n\n3.08.\n\nOne of the preliminary matters which required prior considerations by the COMMITTEE was the question of Allocation of Advance Payments. The first Ad Hoc Committee in this case (para 125 of the Decision of May 16, 1986) ordered AMCO to pay one half of the costs of the first Ad Hoc Committee. Since INDONESIA advanced payment for these costs, the First Ad Hoc Committee ordered AMCO to pay INDONESIA the sum of US$ 103,313.75. In the Award of June 5, 1990, the SECOND TRIBUNAL set off the sum in question against the damages awarded to AMCO. Both PARTIES have since October 3, 1990 requested annulment of the Award and the provisional stay of enforcement was continued in effect by virtue of the COMMITTEE\u2019S Interim Order No. I of March 2, 1991. Having considered the requests of the PARTIES in regard to issues relating to allocation of advance payments, and, following in this respect the reasoning of the SECOND TRIBUNAL (as contained in Its ruling of February 8, 1988, para 13), the COMMITTEE was unable to accede to INDONESIA\u2019S request that advance payments for the present proceedings under ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations be apportioned in their entirety to AMCO until the outstanding award of US$ 103,313.75 and interest claimed to be due on it has been met. The COMMITTEE noted that both PARTIES conceded that the amount of approximately US$ 40,000.00 remaining from the proceedings before the SECOND TRIBUNAL was to be used as advance payment of the proceedings before the SECOND TRIBUNAL was to be used as advance payment of the costs of the current proceeding, and ruled that since both PARTIES had applied for annulment, \"an equal apportionment is appropriate\" under either the pre-1984 Administrative and Financial Regulation 13 (3) (d) or as superseded by Administrative and Financial Regulation 14 (3) (e). (Ruling of the COMMUTEE on Allocation of Advance Payments. Washington, D.C., March 2, 1991).\n\nD. SUBMISSION OF WRITTEN PLEADINGS BY THE PARTIES\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n3.09.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Orders No. 2, 3 and 4, the PARTIES filed the following written pleadings within the authorized time limits :\n\n(1) In respect of INDONESIA\u2019S Applications for the Annulment of the SECOND AWARD and the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD\n\n(a) By INDONESIA\n\n(i) MEMORIAL (with Appendices) In support of INDONESIA\u2019S Applications for Annulment : June 4, 1991\n\n(ii) REPLY (with Appendices) : July 19, 1991\n\n(b) By AMCO\n\n(i) COUNTER-MEMORIAL In opposition to INDONESIA\u2019S Applications for Annulment : July 5, 1991\n\n(2) In respect of AMCO\u2019S Application for Partial Annulment of the SECOND AWARD\n\n(a) by AMCO\n\n(i) AMCO\u2019S Application of October 3, 1991 to be treated as AMCO\u2019S MEMORIAL\n\n(b) by INDONESIA\n\n(i) COUNTER-MEMORIAL (with Appendices) in opposition to AMCO\u2019S Application for Partial Annulment : July 5, 1991\n\n3.10.\n\nSince AMCO did not submit its REPLY to INDONESIA\u2019S COUNTER-MEMORIAL in respect of AMCO\u2019S Application for Partial Annulment of the SECOND AWARD, there was no REJOINDER from either PARTY. AMCO also refrained from filing a REJOINDER in response to INDONESIA\u2019S REPLY of July 19, 1991, in support of INDONESIA\u2019S Applications for the Annulment of the SECOND AWARD and the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD.\n\nE. ORAL HEARINGS ON THE APPLICATIONS FOR ANNULMENT DECEMBER 9-12, 1991\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.11.\n\nThe PARTIES appeared before the COMMITTEE to present their oral arguments in support of their respective Application for Annulment and in opposition to the other PARTY\u2019S Request for Annulment. The oral hearings took place at the Headquarters of ICSID in Washington, D.C., on December 9, 10 and 11, 1991. Members of the COMMITTEE were present. PARTIES were fully represented by Counsel of their choice, the Secretary of the COMMITTEE attending the session on behalf of the Centre. The names of Representatives of the PARTIES are listed in the inner cover page of this Decision.\n\n3.12.\n\nPrior to the oral hearings, a series of correspondence had been exchanged by the PARTIES expressing and supporting their views as to the order and sequence of oral arguments to be submitted by each of the PARTIES. Both the morning session and the afternoon session of December 9, 1991, were devoted to oral presentations by Counsel for INDONESIA on INDONESIA\u2019S Application for Annulment. Ms. Lamm addressed issues relating to res judicata and Mr. Brower spoke on issues concerning liability and damages as well as on INDONESIA\u2019S Request for Annulment of the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD. Mr. Brower\u2019s presentation was concluded during the first part of the morning session on December 10, 1991.\n\n3.13.\n\nMr. Rand, Counsel for AMCO, summarized the background and general context of the case in his opening statement following the conclusion of Mr. Brower\u2019s remarks. Mr. Friedland responded on behalf of AMCO to INDONESIA\u2019S Application for Annulment of the SECOND AWARD and completed his presentation during the afternoon session, followed by Mr. Rand who responded to INDONESIA\u2019S Application for Annulment of the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD. Then Mr. Hornick addressed the issues relating to AMCO\u2019S Application for partial Annulment of the SECOND AWARD.\n\n3.14.\n\nUpon completion of AMCO\u2019S presentation, Ms. Lamm responded to AMCO\u2019 Application for Partial Annulment, and completed her response during the morning session of December 11, 1991. Thereupon, Mr. Brower replied to Mr. Rand\u2019s opening statement relating to INDONESIA\u2019S request for Annulment. Ms. Lamm and Mr. Brower then took turns to reply to AMCO\u2019S response in support of INDONESIA\u2019S Application for Annulment. During the afternoon session, Mr. Hornick offered additional remarks by way of rejoinder to INDONESIA\u2019S request for Annulment and answered INDONESIA\u2019S response to AMCO\u2019S request for Partial Annulment to which Ms. Lamm answered in a rejoinder.\n\n3.15.\n\nUpon completion of presentations by Counsel for both PARTIES, the COMMITTEE sought further clarification from Counsel of AMCO on a certain aspect of AMCO\u2019S submissions. The President invited the PARTIES to make their final observations. Seeing that there were no further questions or comments, the COMMITTEE requested the PARTIES to forward to the COMMITTEE final written submissions by December 12, 1991. This both PARTIES did within the specified date.\n\nF. MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE\n----------------------------\n\n3.16.\n\nAfter adjourning the oral hearings on December 11, 1991, the COMMITTEE met in the morning of December 12, 1991, to deliberate on the case and to plan future sessions of the COMMITTEE with the view to resolving the questions and issues involved and subsequent finalization of the COMMITTEE\u2019S decision. The COMMITTEE met to deliberate on the case for two days, March 26-27, 1992 at the Headquarters of the World Bank in Paris. The COMMITTEE planned to meet as soon as the draft Decision was prepared.\n\n3.17.\n\nThe COMMITTEE met for the last time on November 13-16, 1992, in San Francisco, U.S.A., to prepare the text of the Decision. The COMMITTEE decided on November 16, 1992 to declare the proceeding closed.\n\n**PART TWO - SUBMISSIONS AND CONTENTIONS BY THE PARTIES**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nI. FINAL WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS BY THE PARTIES\n-------------------------------------------\n\n4.01.\n\nWithout tracing each and every step of the series of arguments, contentions and submissions by the Parties, it is useful at this juncture to set out in extenso the final written submissions which the Parties forwarded to the COMMUTEE by December 12, 1991, in response to the COMMITTEE\u2019S request at the close of the oral hearings in Washington, D.C., on December 11, 1991.\n\n(See paragraph 3.15 above)\n\nA. INDONESIA\u2019S SUBMISSIONS\n--------------------------\n\n4.02.\n\n\"I. On the merits of partially annulling the Second Award as requested by the Respondent, to adjudge and declare:\n\n1. That the SECOND TRIBUNAL manifestly exceeded its powers (res judicata : Article 42 (1) (failure to apply Indonesian law and acting ex aequo et bono), that it seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure (audiatur), and that it failed to state the reasons upon which it based the award in finding that Indonesia committed a denial of justice under a new international law theory of an administrative denial of justice based on a so-called generally tainted background.\n\n2. That the SECOND TRIBUNAL manifestly exceeded its powers (res judicata : Article 42 (1) (failure to apply Indonesian law and acting ex aeq uo et bono), that it seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure (audiatur) and that it failed to state the reasons upon which it based the award in finding that the substantive bases for the license revocation need not be adjudicated as a precondition for any aspect of the award, including but not limited to liability, compensation, causation, and proportionality.\n\n3. That the SECOND TRIBUNAL manifestly exceeded its powers (res judicata : Article 42 (1) (failure to apply Indonesian law principles of compensation and acting ex aequo et bono, that it seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure (audiatur), and that it failed to state the reasons regarding causation and proportionality, as well as the other reasons upon which it necessarily must have based the award in finding that Amco was entitled to expropriation-level damages equal to its full contractual expectancy.\n\n4. That the SECOND TRIBUNAL manifestly exceeded its powers (res judicata. Article 42 (1) (failure to apply Indonesian law and acting ex aequo et bono), failed to state the reasons upon which the award is based in finding that Indonesia\u2019s tax concessions counterclaim failed because the Revocation Decree was unlawful.\n\n5. That the SECOND TRIBUNAL manifestly exceeded its powers (rectification of an award not involving a clerical, arithmetical or similar error; and issuance of a decision without satisfying the prerequisite procedures mandated by Article 49 (2) and Rule 49 (4), and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure (audiatur) in finding that there was an \"inadvertent\" error in the Supplemental Award that required rectification by the Supplemental Award\u2019s grant of additional damages to Amco, and that the Supplemental Award failed to state the reasons regarding inadvertency upon which the Supplemental Award necessarily must have been based.\n\nTherefore, paragraphs 12, 40, 75-92, 112-13, 118-140, 142-143, 151-153, 161-162, 174-200 and paragraphs 1 and of the dispositif of the SECOND AWARD, and section 3 of the Supplemental Award must be annulled.\n\nII. On the merits of partially annulling of SECOND AWARD as requested by claimants, to adjudge and declare that the SECOND TRIBUNAL did not manifestly exceed its powers with respect to the nature of the prejudice due to the acts of Indonesia\u2019s army and police and the calculation of the Hotel\u2019s anticipated profit stream.\n\nTherefore, paragraphs 41-63, 164-66, 201-95 of the SECOND AWARD dated June 5, 1990 should not be annulled.\n\nIII. On both Applications, to adjudge and declare pursuant to Article 52 (4) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 13 (3) (d), that claimants shall pay all costs of the annulment proceeding associated with Indonesia\u2019s and Amco\u2019s respective requests for annulment, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee, the charges for use of the facilities of the Centre, and all expenses incurred by Indonesia in connection with this proceeding.\"\n\nB. AMCO\u2019S REQUEST FOR RELIEF\n----------------------------\n\n4.03.\n\n\"1. Indonesia\u2019s Application for Annulment should be denied in its entirety.\n\n2. Amco\u2019s Application for Partial Annulment should be granted, with the consequence that the Higgins Tribunal\u2019s quantification of damages be replaced by the Goldman Tribunal\u2019s quantification of damages in the amount of US$ 3,-200,000 plus interest at 6 % per annum from January 15, 1981, to the date of effective payment outside Indonesia.\n\n3. Amco should be awarded its costs and counsel fees of this proceeding, in such amounts as notified to the Centre by Amco.\"\n\nII. SUBMISSIONS AND CONTENTIONS BY INDONESIA\n--------------------------------------------\n\nA. IN REGARD TO INDONESIA\u2019S REQUEST FOR ANNULMENT OF THE AWARD OF JUNE 5, 1990\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.01.\n\nAs already noted, the Respondent has invoked three of the grounds for annulment listed in Article 52 (1) of the CONVENTION, namely, those under sub-paragraphs (1) (b), (1) (d) and (1) (e) (see supra, Paragraph 1.03). All three of them have been invoked with respect to the principal findings of the SECOND AWARD (see supra, Paragraph 1.04). The grounds under Article 52 (1) (b) and (e) have also been invoked with respect to the rejection of INDONESIA\u2019S Counter-Claims (see supra, Paragraph 1.05).\n\n5.02.\n\nINDONESIA is therefore requesting the annulment of the SECOND AWARD as a whole. In its further submissions, the Respondent has noted a number of exceptions it requested (see its final submissions, quoted supra, Paragraph 4.02).\n\n5.03.\n\nIn setting out the Respondent\u2019s argumentation in this section, the sequence of points used in the Respondent\u2019s Memorial of June 4, 1991 will in the main be followed. The sequence in the initial Application and in the final summary of submissions (supra, Paragraph 4.01) differs in some respects without affecting the substance of the argument.\n\n5.04.\n\nIn this Part, all arguments and materials offered in the Respondent\u2019s written and oral submissions will be restated for review without necessarily tracing each and every argument and submission in the precise order in which they were presented. It follows from the structure of this decision that the points detailed in this section represent the Respondent\u2019s views, as understood by the AD HOC COMMITTEE, and as such it will not be necessary to repeat at every juncture that this is the Respondent\u2019s argument or point of view and not that of the COMMITTEE nor that of AMCO, the claimants, for that matter. AMCO\u2019S contentions and responses will be examined in Section III of this Part.\n\n5.05.\n\nThe first submission of the Respondent is complex and multifacetted. INDONESIA submitted that the SECOND TRIBUNAL has manifestly exceeded its powers in that it has disregarded in several respects the principle of finality, i.e., the res judicata character of portions of the FIRST AWARD, after its partial annulment by the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE. The successive submissions of the Respondent in this respect are :\n\n(a) That it was res judicata that, for liability to arise, both the procedural and substantive grounds for the revocation of AMCO\u2019S license had to be taken into consideration;\n\n(b) That even if the substantive grounds could be left out of consideration, the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019s holding concerning the presence of procedural defects was res judicata and therefore the SECOND TRIBUNAL was not free to redecide the factual findings or the liability framework for procedural irregularities;\n\n(c) That even if damages could be awarded solely on the basis of procedural defects, the SECOND TRIBUNAL was bound to consider the substantive grounds for the revocation before any final decision.\n\n5.06.\n\nAn important underlying argument concerns the res judicata character of the effects of an Ad Hoc Committee\u2019s decision in the framework of the ICSID system. It is common ground that a second Tribunal in an ICSID arbitration is bound by the Committee\u2019s decision annulling an award, or as in the present case, parts of an award. This means : (a) that the parts of the award that are annulled are to be redecided; the Tribunal cannot treat them as already decided; and (b) that the parts that are not annulled remain in effect; they cannot be redecided and are to be treated as res judicata within the ICSID system. The Respondent argues that the \"reasons\" for the entire decision and for each partial decision of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE are necessarily covered by the res judicata effect, since the specific provisions of the dispositif do not make sense without the reasoning that supports them.\n\n5.07.\n\nIn applying this reasoning to the case at hand, the Respondent focusses on the issue of the revocation of AMCO\u2019S investment license. The FIRST TRIBUNAL had held that this revocation was unlawful both on procedural and on substantive grounds. The FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE then found that the revocation was not justified on substantive grounds. Although it accepted and allowed to stand as res judicata the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019s findings as to the presence of procedural defects, it stated that they did not provide an independent ground for awarding damages. The total effect of the FIRST COMMITTEE\u2019S decision was then to leave for redecision to the SECOND TRIBUNAL two specific and rather narrow issues, that of determining the damages due to AMCO for the loss of management rights during the occupation of the hotel (April - July 1980) and that of deciding on INDONESIA\u2019S Counter-Claim.\n\n5.08.\n\nBy virtue of the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S treatment of the relationship between procedural and substantive grounds as well as the explicit statement to that effect by the FIRST AD HOC COMMUTEE, it was res judicata that both procedural and substantive grounds had to be considered before there could be a finding of liability with respect to the revocation, even if such a finding were to be based on procedural defects alone,\n\n5.09.\n\nMoreover, even if a decision on liability could be rendered without considering the substantive grounds for revocation, the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S findings on the procedural issues was res judicata and it covered both factual elements and possible liability. It was for this reason that the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE had specifically annulled the grant of compensation for procedural defects by the FIRST TRIBUNAL (Paragraph 106 of FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S Decision). The SECOND TRIBUNAL was then not free to separate these res judicata findings from their established liability framework and base on them a new doctrine concerning liability for procedural defects only. In so doing, in fact, the SECOND TRIBUNAL had restated the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S factual findings, thereby replacing them with its own new ones.\n\n5.10.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL has further violated the principle of finality (res judicata) by applying international law and disregarding Indonesian administrative law, when the latter had been held by the FIRST TRIBUNAL to be the applicable law to the proceedings, in accordance with Article 42 of the CONVENTION.\n\n5.11.\n\nSecondly, the SECOND TRIBUNAL had also manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply and give full effect to Article 42 of the CONVENTION relating to the applicable law. This has occurred :\n\n(a) When the Tribunal disregarded Indonesian administrative law and, invoking the concept of denial of justice, applied its own appreciation of international law instead;\n\n(b) When it purported to apply international law but, through the misuse of existing principles as to denial of justice, decided in fact the case on an ex aequo et bono basis;\n\n(c) When in computing damages it misapplied both Indonesian and international law.\n\n5.12.\n\nConsistent interpretation of Article 42 of the CONVENTION, by Arbitration Tribunals, Ad Hoc Committees and scholars, has made clear that, in the framework of ICSID, absent an agreement by the parties to different effect, the law of the State party to the dispute is the applicable law. Rules of international law are to be applied only where there is a lacuna in the applicable (national) law or when the applicable law violates minimum international standards. In this case, no argument that there is a lacuna in Indonesian law or that Indonesian law violates international standards has been made. Yet, the SECOND TRIBUNAL has held that \"international law is fully applicable\" and has stressed moreover that it makes no sense to speak of a \"supplemental or corrective\" role for international law.\n\n5.13.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL appears to have considered that a lacuna exists in Indonesian law, subject to a vague finding about the existence of \"slight authority\". It reached this conclusion by searching for a specific remedy that would be applicable to a situation such as the one in the case at hand, instead of relying on the entire existing legal framework of Indonesian administrative law and reaching itself the decision an Indonesian court would have reached on that basis.\n\n5.14.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL proceeded on the basis that it had to test each claim of law against first Indonesian law and then international law. This approach disregards the essentially secondary role attributed to international law in the framework of the CONVENTION.\n\n5.15.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL\u2019s holding as to liability based on procedural defects alone was in violation of Indonesian administrative law, according to which a finding of substantive failings is indispensable for determining the issue of liability.\n\n5.16.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL further disregarded Article 42 of the CONVENTION in that in purporting to apply international law it misused the concept of a denial of justice. It did so in several respects. First, denial of justice may occur only where a State fails to provide to an alien the means of redress to which he is entitled. Absent a showing of exhaustion of local remedies, there can be no finding of a denial of justice. Secondly, denial of justice may arise only where acts of judicial organs are involved and not with respect to administrative acts issued by executive agencies. In the third place, liability based on a denial of justice may be found to exist only where the conduct at issue is truly outrageous, something which is not the case here.\n\n5.17.\n\nIn view of the above, the purported application of the denial of justice doctrine by the SECOND TRIBUNAL failed to apply any established legal principle to the facts of the case and amounted in essence to an ex aequo et bono decision. Not only was the tribunal not empowered to decide the case on that basis, but its decision did not conform to established equitable standards, in particular because it ignored AMCO\u2019S own misconduct toward Indonesian authorities and law.\n\n5.18.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL further failed to apply the applicable law with respect to its method for assessment of damages. First, it disregarded the requirements of both Indonesian and international law with respect to the need for establishing a definite chain of causation between the acts involved and the loss to be compensated, since it has not been proved that the procedural failings on the part of BKPM were the cause of AMCO\u2019S loss. Secondly, it disregarded the principle of proportionality which Indonesian law requires to be applied in such circumstances.\n\n5.19.\n\nThirdly, the SECOND AWARD failed to state the reasons for its findings and decisions :\n\n(a) It failed to state reasons with respect to its finding of an administrative denial of justice as the basis of an award of damages for procedural defects only;\n\n(b) It failed to state reasons for its rejection of the need for a consideration of the substantive grounds for the revocation of AMCO\u2019S license.\n\n(c) It failed to state reasons upon which the AWARD was based in finding that INDONESIA\u2019S tax concession Counter-Claim failed because the revocation decree was unlawful.\n\n5.20.\n\nIn rejecting the formulation of the liability issue, which both PARTIES have proposed, in terms of liability vel non for procedural defects alone, the SECOND TRIBUNAL presented its own approach without offering any explanation as to the reasons why it was more appropriate or better than the other one.\n\n5.21.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL further failed to state reasons when it purported to examine and apply a number of references to authority and cases, both in Indonesian and in international law, which were not apposite in view of what the Tribunal wanted them to show. Such use of inapposite authority constitutes in fact a failure to state reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s decisions.\n\n5.22.\n\nFinally, the SECOND AWARD departs from a fundamental rule of procedure in that it was prepared in violation of the audiatur rule in several respects :\n\n(a) When the SECOND TRIBUNAL had recourse to a new framework of liability without notice to the parties, thereby depriving them of the right to be heard on issues which eventually determined the outcome;\n\n(b) When it refused to consider new evidence, while making new inferences from the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S factual findings.\n\n5.23.\n\nIt is to be observed that INDONESIA\u2019 submissions and contentions in this Section of Part Two are contested by AMCO in Section III of the same Part, while AMCO\u2019S submissions and contentions in Section III are noted in this Section as categorically rejected by INDONESIA.\n\n(See paragraph 4.02 II above)\n\nB. IN REGARD TO INDONESIA\u2019S REQUEST FOR ANNULMENT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD OF OCTOBER 17, 1990\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.24.\n\nIn its Application of February 14, 1991, INDONESIA requested annulment of the SECOND TRIBUNAL\u2019s SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD of October 17, 1990, with respect to the value to be assigned to AMCO\u2019S Aeropacific assets.\n\n5.25.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL, on AMCO\u2019S request, and based on Article 49(2) of the CONVENTION, found that a \"clerical, arithmetical or similar error\" had occurred in the AWARD since two diverging figures were given therein for the Aeropacific assets transferred to AMCO under the AMCO-Aeropacific Settlement Agreement of March 29, 1980. Paragraphs 221 and 222 of the AWARD state that the book value of the assets amount to Rp. 421,451,054.- while, on the other hand, the calculation of the damages made in the AWARD was based on a larger net book value of Rp. 625,730,000.-, indicated in the tables annexed to Paragraph 284 on pages 170-171, column 7 of the AWARD. (As to this figure, see Paragraph 9.03 below). The TRIBUNAL, in its SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD, states that it had decided to rely on the lower figure indicated in Paragraph 222. It therefore rectified the figures indicated in Paragraph 284 of the AWARD. As a consequence of this rectification, the sum of the damages to be paid to AMCO by INDONESIA increased from US$ 2,567,966.20 to US$ 2,677,126.20.\n\n5.26.\n\nINDONESIA requests annulment of this finding on three grounds. The first ground is \"manifest excess of powers\". INDONESIA contends that the TRIBUNAL, in adopting the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD, did in fact reconsider an issue already decided instead of rectifying a clerical or similar error. It bases its argument on the fact that the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD says : \"The Tribunal... has preferred\" the lower figure. INDONESIA relates the expression \"has preferred\" to the rectification procedure, not to the time the TRIBUNAL rendered the AWARD, and therefore believes that the TRIBUNAL changed its mind in the rectification phase and altered its decision.\n\n(INDONESIA\u2019s Application for Annulment of the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD, February 14, 1991, pages 12, 14 and 16).\n\n5.27.\n\nThe second ground for annulment, advanced by INDONESIA is \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\". INDONESIA contends that the TRIBUNAL deliberated without giving notice to INDONESIA, that it had failed to fix a time limit for receiving the observations of INDONESIA, as required by Arbitration Rule 49 (3), and had violated the principle that the PARTIES be treated equally.\n\n(Ibid., pages 15 and 17)\n\n5.28.\n\nThird, INDONESIA contends that the TRIBUNAL failed to state reasons in not demonstrating the inadvertent quality of the error, by presenting illusory reasons and in not stating reasons for rejecting INDONESIA\u2019S position with respect to the jurisdictional objections it had raised in its letter to the TRIBUNAL concerning jurisdiction.\n\n(Ibid., pages 15, 18-19)\n\n5.29.\n\nIt is to be noted that to INDONESIA\u2019S submissions and contentions in this connection, AMCO responded in Section V of AMCO\u2019S Counter Memorial, pages 76-79, that the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD of October 17, 1990 properly corrected an inadvertent error in the AWARD.\n\nIII. SUBMISSIONS AND CONTENTIONS BY AMCO\n----------------------------------------\n\nA. IN REGARD TO AMCO\u2019S REQUEST FOR ANNULMENT IN PART OF THE AWARD OF JUNE 5, 1990\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.01.\n\nAMCO contends that the SECOND TRIBUNAL manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52 (1) (b) of the CONVENTION) by relitigating two issues which had not been annulled by the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE and were therefore res judicata. These issues are\n\n(1) Redetermination of the Nature of the Prejudice Suffered by AMCO from the Army and Police Actions of March 31/April 1, 1980; and\n\n(2) Redetermination of the Aggregate Amount of Damages Due AMCO for the Army and Police Actions of March 31/April 1, 1980, and the Revocation of AMCO\u2019S Investment License on July 9, 1980.\n\n6.02.\n\nThe first issue concerns the prejudice AMCO suffered from the army and police actions on March 31/April 1, 1980. AMCO points to the fact that the FIRST TRIBUNAL made an explicit finding on the nature of the prejudice in ruling that such actions deprived AMCO of its right to operate the Hotel Kartika Plaza and, from April 1, 1980, caused AMCO to lose future income it was entitled to expect from the exercise of such rights. AMCO argues that INDONESIA had not sought to annul this finding and that the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE did not annul it. Accordingly, the finding of the FIRST TRIBUNAL was, in AMCO\u2019S opinion, res judicata.\n\n6.03.\n\nIn contradiction to this, AMCO maintains, the SECOND TRIBUNAL relitigated the matter. It ruled that \"the precise nature of the prejudice suffered\" remained \"properly open before this tribunal\". Contrary to the FIRST AWARD, the SECOND TRIBUNAL determined that AMCO had not suffered any loss of future income from the army and police actions, but only \"a general disturbance\" for which it awarded AMCO a compensation of US$ 10,000.00. According to AMCO, it is res judicata that the army and police actions deprived AMCO of future income from April 1, 1980, and the SECOND TRIBUNAL was bound to award AMCO the value of its lost income from April 1, 1980. The only issue which the TRIBUNAL had the power to decide, in AMCO\u2019S view, was whether in respect of this internationally wrongful act AMCO was entitled to all future income from the entire remaining lease period after April 1, 1980, or as INDONESIA contended, only for some lesser period commencing on April 1, 1980, and ending on the date of the license revocation or the date in October 1980, when the armed forces personnel withdrew from the hotel.\n\n(AMCO' Application for Annulment in Part, October 3, 1990, pages 8-10)\n\n6.04.\n\nThe second issue relates to the quantification of the damages both for the army and police actions of March 31/April 1, 1980, and for the revocation of the investment license on July 9, 1980. The FIRST TRIBUNAL awarded AMCO damages of US$ 3,200,000.00 for both wrongs. It considered it unnecessary to determine what portion of AMCO\u2019S lost future income was attributable to the army and police actions and what portion to the revocation of the investment license, because the effects of the two causes \"acted successively in an uninterrupted period of time\".\n\n(FIRST AWARD, Paragraph 258)\n\n6.05.\n\nAMCO maintains that INDONESIA had not sought to annul the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S quantification of AMCO\u2019S loss. It states that INDONESIA had not sought to annul in particular either the discounted cash flow method of valuation adopted by the FIRST TRIBUNAL, or the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S interpretation of the profit-sharing formula between AMCO and P.T, WISMA, or any of the component findings on the calculation itself, including the estimated base year income, the inflation, discount and tax rates to be used, and the additional value which RAMADA would be expected to add. Furthermore, AMCO contends that the FIRST COMMITTEE did not annul any aspect of the damages quantification. In AMCO\u2019S view, the SECOND TRIBUNAL therefore acted in manifest excess of its powers when it relitigated the quantification of AMCO\u2019S loss, including all the items mentioned above and the exchange rate for the conversion of rupiahs to U.S. dollars. AMCO further asserts that after the SECOND TRIBUNAL reestablished INDONESIA\u2019S liability for the revocation of AMCO\u2019S investment license, the SECOND TRIBUNAL would have been bound to award AMCO the full sum of US$ 3,200,000.00 as fixed by the FIRST TRIBUNAL, such quantification being res judicata.\n\n6.06.\n\nINDONESIA, on the other hand, contends that, in the proceedings before the SECOND TRIBUNAL, AMCO had consistently interpreted the quantification of damages as having been annulled by the FIRST COMMITTEE and therefore as being open to new determination. INDONESIA therefore asserts that AMCO is estopped from arguing that the quantification is res judicata.\n\n(INDONESIA\u2019S Counter-Memorial, July 5, 1991, pages 33-39)\n\nB. IN REGARD TO INDONESIA\u2019S REQUEST FOR ANNULMENT OF THE AWARD OF JUNE 5, 1990\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.07.\n\nIn AMCO\u2019S COUNTER-MEMORIAL of July 5, 1991 in opposition to INDONESIA\u2019S Annulment Application, AMCO rejected INDONESIA\u2019S Request for Annulment on each and every ground and in its entirety. This position was reaffirmed in the final written submission by AMCO dated December 12, 1991, cited in Paragraph 4.03 above.\n\n6.08.\n\nIn particular, AMCO maintains that\n\n(1) The SECOND TRIBUNAL did not violate any principle of finality by awarding damages due to the unlawful license revocation;\n\n(2) The SECOND TRIBUNAL did not manifestly exceed its power in applying Indonesian and international law;\n\n(3) The SECOND TRIBUNAL did not fail to state reasons for its AWARD; and\n\n(4) The SECOND TRIBUNAL did not violate any Rule of Procedure, fundamental or otherwise, by holding that BKPM\u2019s violations constitute an administrative denial of justice.\n\n6.09.\n\nThese contentions were reiterated in the oral hearings by AMCO as indeed in a more categorical manner in the final written submissions of December 12, 1991.\n\nC. IN REGARD TO INDONESIA\u2019S REQUEST FOR ANNULMENT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD OF OCTOBER 17, 1990\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.10.\n\nAMCO opposed INDONESIA\u2019S request for annulment of the Supplemental Award of October 17, 1991 in its Counter-Memorial of July 5, 1991, pages 76-78, on the ground that the SECOND TRIBUNAL\u2019S Rectification Decision properly corrected an inadvertent error in the SECOND AWARD.\n\n6.11.\n\nAMCO\u2019S contention in this connection was included in a more sweeping rejection of INDONESIA\u2019S Request for Annulment in its entirety in Paragraph 1 of its final written submissions of December 12, 1991.\n\n**PART THREE - CONSIDERATIONS, FINDINGS AND POSITIONS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.01.\n\nHaving set out in outline the series of successive Submissions and Contentions by the PARTIES, the COMMITTEE will now proceed to examine them in some detail and wherever appropriate to state its views thereon including the findings and positions adopted by the COMMITTEE on each of the issues requiring its consideration and decision. In so doing, the COMMITTEE finds it convenient to treat each Application for Annulment in the order in which the requests for annulment were presented and contested by the PARTIES. Where required by economy, however, and to avoid undue repetitions and overlaps, the COMMITTEE will discuss together several of the points contained in the submissions.\n\nI. THE APPLICATION BY INDONESIA FOR ANNULMENT OF THE AWARD OF JUNE 5, 1990\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. RES JUDICATA IN RESPECT OF PROCEDURAL IRREGULARITIES\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.02.\n\nA central argument on the part of the Respondent is that the SECOND TRIBUNAL manifestly exceeded its powers because it disregarded the res judicata character of the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S findings with respect to the issue of liability for procedural irregularities in the revocation of the investment license.\n\n7.03.\n\nAs already noted (supra, Paragraph 5.05 et seq.), the Respondent\u2019s argumentation is multifacetted and is formulated in terms of a series of alternative arguments. According to it, in the first place, it is res judicata that for liability to arise both procedural and substantive defects must be found to exist. Secondly, the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S findings as to the presence of procedural defects was res judicata and covered both the factual findings and the lack of liability in the absence of substantive defects. Thirdly, it was res judicata that relevant issues had to be decided on the basis of Indonesian law.\n\n7.04.\n\nThis issue is in several respects fundamental to the matters before the COMMITTEE and deserves fuller exploration. The cumulative effects of the three decisions involved, namely, the FIRST AWARD, the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S DECISION and the SECOND AWARD, are interrelated in a highly complex manner. Moreover, it is not unfair to state that the three decisions are not of utmost clarity nor are they unequivocal with respect to this specific point.\n\n7.05.\n\nWhen approaching the issue of the lawfulness of the license revocation, the FIRST TRIBUNAL considered the question of the legal character of the administrative act involved (the investment approval or license) and of the consequent relationship between the PARTIES and concluded Paragraph 191 of the FIRST AWARD :\n\n\"To characterize the combination of the application and the approval, not as a contract properly speaking, identical to a private law contract, but as a bilateral relationship creating obligations for both parties, does not prevent the Claimants from claiming compensation for the damages, if any, they suffered as a consequence of the withdrawal of the approval, provided of course, that the same is not substantially justified... Respondent has put forward the reasons which, in its view, justified the license revocation in this case, and implicitly, but clearly, accepted.... that lacking such reasons, the applications\u2019s approval could not have been withdrawn.\" (emphasis added).\n\n7.06.\n\nThe FIRST TRIBUNAL then considered the facts concerning the procedure leading to the license revocation. It found several defects, and was thus led to the conclusion that \"said \u2019procedure\u2019 did not grant to the Claimants due process of law\" (Paragraph 201). It then went on to state (same paragraph) :\n\n\"Accordingly, this procedure was contrary, not only to the Indonesian regulations.., but to the general and fundamental principle of due process as well. This finding by itself allows the Tribunal to conclude that the revocation of the approval of the investment application was unlawfully and therefore,wrongfully decided whatever the reasons on which it was based and,even if, as a matter of substance, said reasons could have justified it. \" (emphasis added).\n\nIn the paragraph immediately following, the TRIBUNAL stated (Paragraph 202) :\n\n\"However, the Tribunal believes it is necessary to examine and evaluate these reasons, and it will do so hereunder. \"\n\nAfter a brief excursus on two subsidiary points, it repeated its earlier conclusion (Paragraph 203) :\n\n\"It thus remains that the revocation was unlawful in respect of the procedure that resulted in it.\"\n\n7.07.\n\nAfter a lengthy study of the substantive reasons for the revocation the FIRST TRIBUNAL found that they did not justify the revocation of the license and concluded (Paragraph 242):\n\n\"In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this conclusion could be based merely on the substantial examination of the two reasons, on which the revocation Decision relies. However, the Tribunal wishes to recall that independently from this examination and its conclusions, the mere lack of due process would have been an insuperable obstacle to the lawfulness of the revocation : the fact of the matter is that the revocation of the license was unlawful in this respect, and unjustified as regards the reasons on which it is based.\" (emphasis added).\n\n7.08.\n\nWhile not strictly speaking self-contradictory, the three successive conclusions just summarized and quoted do not seem to point precisely in the same direction. This has caused problems in the subsequent decisions. The very first quotation (Paragraph 191 of the FIRST AWARD; Paragraph 7.07 above) seems to suggest that justification on substantive grounds is a necessary precondition for liability. The second set of quotations (Paragraphs 201-203 of the FIRST AWARD; Paragraph 7.07 above) opens on a seemingly clear statement of procedural unlawfulness (Paragraph 201 of the FIRST AWARD). Yet, the AWARD deliberately leaves open the exact relationship between lack of due process and lack of substantive justification. The TRIBUNAL moves from the one to the other with minimal words of transition (\" However.... it is necessary...\"; \"the Tribunal will now examine...\"), avoiding any clear indication as to the exact legal reason why it proceeds to examine the substantive ground for the revocation, and thereby leaving open the question whether procedural defects are sufficient to permit the award of damages or a finding of substantive defects must also be present. The third quotation, however (Paragraph 242 of the FIRST AWARD; Paragraph 7.07 above), expressly states that lack of due process would be sufficient to make the revocation \"unlawful\". By thus providing a clear answer in favor of the first alternative, it suggests that the impression left by the first quotation is not accurate.\n\n7.09.\n\nA careful reading in context suggests that there is in fact no contradiction between the first and the third quotation. The affirmation in Paragraph 191 that, for damages to be due, the revocation should be justified in substance (cf. also to similar effect Paragraphs 194 and 213 of the FIRST AWARD) in no way negates the independent importance of procedural considerations. The issue the Tribunal is addressing is whether there can be damages for the revocation of an administrative act with quasi-contractual overtones (i.e., the investment approval or license). It answers this question in the affirmative, adding the obvious (but not unnecessary) caution that damages are not due where the revocation of the act in question is justified. There is no indication that by omitting to refer to procedural defects it means to limit its answer only to cases where substantive justification is lacking. It merely does not address at that point that question, to which in fact it turns immediately afterwards. Whatever inference one might have drawn, when reading Paragraph 191, from its silence on the importance of procedural defects, is shown to be unwarranted by the explicit language in Paragraph 242.\n\n7.10.\n\nThe problems that confronted the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE on this issue stem from its conclusion that the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S findings as to the lack of substantive reasons constituted a manifest excess of powers and had to be annulled while the findings as to the presence of procedural irregularities were substantially correct and were therefore to be left standing unannulled. The FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE started by pointing out that the FIRST TRIBUNAL \"felt that it lacked the power to suspend or cancel the effects of the... revocation order\" (Paragraph 74 of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S Decision) and therefore \"could only award compensation to P.T. AMCO for damages, if any, sustained by it from the definite revocation order. The amount of such compensation was of course dependent on whether or not the revocation was justified on substantive grounds\". (Ibid., emphasis added)\n\n7.11.\n\nThe FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE then addressed directly the issue here considered. It noted (Paragraph 80 of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S Decision) that :\n\n\"... the Tribunal held (FIRST AWARD, Paragraph 201) that these procedural irregularities were sufficient grounds for concluding that the BKPM revocation order was illegal according to Indonesian law, entailing the further consequence of responsibility of Indonesia for damages towards Amco.\"\n\nThe FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE disagreed with this holding. It stated (Paragraph 81 of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S Decision) :\n\n\"The fundamental character of Indonesian Administrative law seems, to the ad hoc Committee, to be such that a conclusion on the legality of an act of an Indonesian public authority, and on its implications for responsibility for damages, can be reached only after an overall evaluation of the act, including consideration of its substantive bases.\"\n\n7.12.\n\nAt this point, the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE could have annulled the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S holding, possibly on the ground that its misunderstanding of Indonesian law amounted to an excess of powers. It took, however, a different route, perhaps because it did not consider such action appropriate in an annulment (as distinguished from a review) proceeding since the incorrect application of law is not a manifest excess of powers (unless it amounts to effective disregard of the applicable law). Possibly, it was not itself fully satisfied as to the legal basis for its position (as might be inferred from the rather weak and vague language it used : \"the fundamental character of Indonesian administrative law seems... to be such... that...\"). It chose to adopt a construction of the FIRST AWARD more consistent with its own view on the matter. It thus stated (Paragraph 82 of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S Decision) :\n\n\"The ad hoc Committee believes that the Tribunal in its finding (FIRST AWARD, Paragraph 201 in fine) concerning the illegality of the order because of procedural defects merely intended to state that the order did not fully comply with Indonesian administrative law. This intent is clearly suggested by the fact that the Tribunal immediately found it \"necessary\" (FIRST AWARD, Paragraph 202, first line) to deal with the substantive reasons of the revocation, for the assessment of the amount of damages, if any, due to Claimants because of the revocation.\" (emphasis added)\n\n7.13.\n\nOn that basis, the FIRST. AD HOC COMMITTEE rejected the request for annulment, holding (Paragraph 83 of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S Decision) that :\n\n\"... the Tribunal, by affirming the illegality of the revocation procedure while, at the same time, conditioning the award of damages upon the existence of substantive reasons for the revocation, did not manifestly exceed its.powers in interpreting and applying Indonesian law in this regard.\"\n\nThus, in these last two quotations, the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE made it clear that the only reason it did not annul the finding of the FIRST TRIBUNAL was that it chose to offer an interpretation of the FIRST AWARD that made such annulment unnecessary. It is apparent, however, from the discussion of the FIRST AWARD already offered here that this interpretation of its findings on the issue at hand was not the only possible one.\n\n7.14.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL confronted this issue in its Decision on Jurisdiction on the basis of the distinction it applied between the actual decisions of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE as to annulment of specific findings of the FIRST AWARD and the reasoning \"integral to\" such decisions. The SECOND TRIBUNAL decided to treat as res judicata only the former and to consider as open for redetermination the issues covered by the latter. As a consequence, it held that \"the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S finding that the procedure of the license revocation was unlawful\" was res judicata (Paragraph 48, at (ii)). When, at a later point, it addressed directly the issue whether \"procedural defects alone justify damages\", it found \"that the First Tribunal does not seem ever to have found in terms that procedural defects alone justify damages nor has the Ad Hoc Committee clearly pronounced on this precise issue (Paragraphs 90-92). Accordingly, this item was held to be open for reconsideration by the SECOND TRIBUNAL.\n\n7.15.\n\nOn the basis of the analysis offered above (Paragraphs 7.05-7.13), the SECOND TRIBUNAL\u2019S interpretation of the two earlier decisions is by no means unreasonable, whether or not one agrees with the final conclusion. The central issue is not whether the pertinent unannulled findings of the FIRST TRIBUNAL are res judicata for the proceedings before the SECOND TRIBUNAL. It is apparent that they are and nobody disputes it. The issue in controversy is whether the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S interpretation of these findings, as set out above (Paragraphs 7.10-7.14), is binding on the SECOND TRIBUNAL as res judicata. It should be kept in mind, however, that an Ad Hoc Committee has the power to annul an Award but may not revise or amend it. To recognize binding effect to an interpretation of part of an Award by a Committee, even an interpretation on the basis of which the Committee decided not to annul that part, would be the equivalent of granting the Committee the power to amend, i.e., to establish authoritatively one of several possible constructions as the only valid one. The CONVENTION provides in Article 50 a separate procedure for the authoritative interpretation of Awards. The function of annulment proceedings is separate and different.\n\n7.16.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL has not accepted the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S interpretation of the points in the FIRST AWARD at issue here. It has proceeded to construe the AWARD on its own on these points and has reached conclusions which differ from those of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE. These conclusions, however, as the analysis offered above (Paragraphs 7.05-7.13) suggests, cannot be considered manifestly erroneous, nor are they precluded by any res judicata effect flowing from the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S grounds for not annulling the pertinent portions of the FIRST AWARD.\n\n7.17.\n\nTo sum up the conclusions from the preceding paragraphs (7.05-7.16), the SECOND TRIBUNAL has not disregarded any res judicata holdings nor has it manifestly exceeded its powers in its interpretation of the language and the effects of the FIRST AWARD and the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S Decision with respect to the issue of liability for procedural defects in the revocation of AMCO\u2019S investment license. The consequences flowing from its approach, namely, the broadening of the issues to be redecided beyond two narrow questions (supra, Paragraph 5.07) were not inappropriate, nor did they involve a disregard for the principle of finality.\n\nB. APPLICATION OF INDONESIAN AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n7.18.\n\nThe Respondent argues further that the SECOND TRIBUNAL has failed to apply the applicable law, namely, Indonesian law. That law was applicable both because the finding to that effect in the FIRST AWARD was not annulled and was therefore res judicata and because Article 42 of the CONVENTION so requires, independently of any res judicata effect. Evidently, this is one and the same issue, comprising several discrete sets of submissions by the Respondent. First, the TRIBUNAL has failed sufficiently to consider and apply Indonesian law both with respect to the issue of liability for procedural defects alone and in the manner in which it assessed the compensation to be paid. Secondly, the TRIBUNAL failed to apply Indonesian law, because it purported to apply international law.\n\n7.19.\n\nThe question of applicable law is of considerable importance in ICSID arbitrations. It is well established, by the legislative history of the CONVENTION, by the case-law of ICSID Tribunals and Ad Hoc Committees and by doctrinal commentary, that the requirement of application of the national law of the State party to the dispute in Article 42 (1) of the CONVENTION is a central element of the structure of the ICSID system. It follows that non-application of such law may constitute manifest excess of powers which entails annulment. At the same time, the incorrect application of national law, its \"misapplication\" or incorrect interpretation does not normally provide a proper ground for annulment. An Ad Hoe Committee is empowered to annul Awards only on the basis of the grounds listed in the CONVENTION. These grounds do not include the review of Awards, with respect to the correctness or validity of their interpretation or application of legal rules and principles. It is of course theoretically possible for an Ad Hoc Committee to infer from the treatment of national law in an Award the Tribunal\u2019s intention not to apply national law. More realistically, an Ad Hoc Committee may find that the misapplication, etc. of national law is of such a nature or degree as to constitute objectively (regardless of the Tribunal\u2019s actual or presumed intentions) its effective nonapplication.\n\n7.20.\n\nIn the instant case, the SECOND TRIBUNAL did in quire at some length into the pertinent authorities on Indonesian law that the PARTIES had brought to its attention (Paragraphs 114-121 of the SECOND AWARD). After minute consideration of their relevance to the specific points at issue, it ended by essentially dismissing most of them as not being quite in point, although still finding \"some slight authority\" which pointed in the same direction as the decision it eventually reached. Its conclusion is worth quoting in full (Paragraph 121 of the SECOND AWARD) :\n\n\"The Tribunal concludes that Indonesian law does not clearly stipulate whether a procedurally unlawful act per se generates compensation; or whether a decision tainted by bad faith is necessarily unlawful. There is, however, some slight authority for the view that these last two questions might be answered in the affirmative under Indonesian law,\"\n\n7.21.\n\nThe COMMITTEE finds no manifest disregard of Indonesian law by the SECOND TRIBUNAL as to the issue of liability for procedural irregularities alone. The SECOND TRIBUNAL examined the cases and authorities submitted to it, stated in its AWARD its views on them and reached the conclusion which it also presented in the AWARD. It is not necessary (indeed it is not appropriate) for the COMMITTEE to reach its own definite conclusions as to the substance of Indonesian administrative law on the matter, nor does the COMMITTEE have to express its agreement or disagreement with the conclusions reached by the Tribunal. It is enough for the COMMITTEE to find, as it does, first, that the treatment of the issue and the conclusions reached by the SECOND TRIBUNAL are not so clearly in disregard of Indonesian law as to suggest that the Tribunal has failed to apply that law, thereby manifestly exceeding its powers, and secondly that the Tribunal has given reasons for reaching the conclusions it reached.\n\n7.22.\n\nThe above findings are sufficient to cover separate submissions by the Respondent to the effect that the SECOND TRIBUNAL has manifestly exceeded its powers when deciding that the substantive validity of the revocation need not be decided before awarding damages to AMCO and when rejecting the Respondent\u2019s counter-claims as well as in so deciding the Tribunal has failed to state reasons and has departed from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n7.23.\n\nWhile the SECOND TRI3UNAL has seriously considered and sought to apply Indonesian law, it has also applied international law and has indeed based its final decision on the presence of an internationally unlawful act. The Respondent submits that, in so doing, it has applied international law instead of Indonesian law, thus disregarding the provisions of Article 42 (1) of the CONVENTION.\n\n7.24.\n\nThe relevant language of that provision prescribes that, in the absence of express agreement between the parties, \"the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute... and such rules of international law as may be applicable\" will be applied. There has been considerable literature and case-law concerning the interpretation and application of this provision. The legislative history of the CONVENTION suggests that the Article was deliberately formulated in a manner which, while clearly providing for application of national law, left open the identity of the international law rules to be applied and the exact circumstances under which they may be applicable. Arbitral Tribunals, Ad Hoc Committees and learned writers have rephrased in various manners the provision of Article 42 (1); despite differences in the specific formulation, outcomes appear fairly comparable.\n\n7.25.\n\nWhen dealing with this question, the SECOND TRIBUNAL (Paragraphs 37-40 of the SECOND AWARD) reviewed the pertinent submissions of the PARTIES as well as the positions of the FIRST TRIBUNAL and the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE, noting that the latter had qualified the role of international law as \"supplemental and corrective\" (Paragraph 22 of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE decision). The SECOND TRIBUNAL disagreed and stated (Paragraph 40) :\n\n\"If there are no relevant host-state laws on a particular matter, a search must be made for the relevant international laws. And, where there are applicable host-state laws, they must be checked against international laws, which will prevail in case of conflict. Thus international law is fully applicable and to classify its role as \"only\" \"supplemental and corrective\" seems a distinction without a difference. In any event, the Tribunal believes that its task is to test every claim of law in this case first against Indonesian law, and then against international law.\"\n\n7.26.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL may have overstated the extent to which international law is generally applicable in the framework of an ICSID arbitration. It does make a difference, not only in abstracto but also in view of a number of possible specific situations, if international law is applied to supplement host-state law or only in case of conflict with that law. To state moreover that international law is \"fully applicable\" may amount to reading out of Article 42 (1) the carefully drafted and very definite reference to the application of host-state law. Still, the matter has to be considered in the specific context of each particular case and problem. In the instant case, one must take into account several specific points. To begin with, the extent to which the application of national law by the Tribunal left many questions unanswered is directly relevant; besides, it is not true that in all cases the absence of a specific rule or remedy in a legal system necessarily implies that a rule in the opposite direction obtains. It should be kept in mind, furthermore, that the TRIBUNAL did find \"some slight authority\" in Indonesian law in the direction in which it eventually was to decide the case. Finally, it is also relevant that the TRIBUNAL did not find any international law cases \"on all fours\" with the problems it was facing. The COMMITTEE thus concludes that, in seeking a solution to the issues before it within the frameworks of both Indonesian and international law, the actual treatment of the matter by the SECOND TRIBUNAL was well within the provisions of Article 42 (1). The COMMITTEE finds therefore that the TRIBUNAL did not manifestly exceed its powers in applying international as well as Indonesian law to the issues.\n\n7.27.\n\nThe Respondent has argued further that the SECOND TRIBUNAL failed to apply the applicable law, both Indonesian and international, in assessing the damages to be awarded. It did so, according to the Respondent, by disregarding the requirements of causation and proportionality that are in fact found in both bodies of law. The COMMITTEE finds that there is no such failure for the following reasons.\n\n7.28.\n\nThe possible misapplication or incorrect application in the concrete instance of a legal rule or principle must be distinguished from the non-application of a body of law. The Respondent has criticized at length the manner in which the SECOND TRIBUNAL has approached the issue of causality and has insisted that an Indonesian court would in all likelihood have reached different results. Yet, the AD HOC COMMITTEE does not have to agree with or to approve the manner in which the TRIBUNAL has applied the law. It only has to inquire into the extent to which it has in fact applied legal principles (and not decided the issue ex aequo et bono, something which would constitute manifest excess of powers) as well as into the identity of the law the TRIBUNAL has applied. Errors in law or misunderstandings of its import do not fall under the heading of nonapplication of applicable law, subject to the caveats already mentioned (supra, Paragraph 7.19).\n\n7.29.\n\nIt is not necessary for present purposes to decide whether application of the principle of proportionality is strictly appropriate in this case, in the context of an award based solely on a lack of due process. Proportional allocation of loss according to the relative fault of the parties implies comparability between the types of fault involved. Denial of due process, however, has no equivalent on the other side of the equation. Still, the fundamental point made in the preceding paragraph is also applicable in this case. It is the application or non-application of the appropriate body of law that is pertinent for the purposes of an annulment decision, not the correct or incorrect manner in which the law may have been applied.\n\nC. DENIAL OF JUSTICE, TAINTED BACKGROUND AND BAD FAITH\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.30.\n\nWhile the SECOND TRIBUNAL considered at some length the issue whether procedural defects alone justify the award of damages, an issue central to AMCO\u2019S claim as submitted to the TRIBUNAL, and found indeed that \"there was some slight authority\" to that effect in Indonesian law, it made clear that this is not the ground on which it was deciding the case before it. As the Tribunal repeatedly stated, the issue it decided was whether the disregard of due process in revoking AMCO\u2019S license was of such a character as to render the revocation unlawful, such unlawfulness being a ground on which the award of damages may be based. The Respondent has attacked this reformulation of the issue on several grounds. Before considering these complaints, it is useful briefly to summarize the SECOND TRIBUNAL\u2019S reasoning in this respect.\n\n7.31.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL formulated the legal point at issue in a number of ways. At an early stage (Paragraph 75 of the SECOND AWARD), it stated its disagreement with the manner in which the PARTIES had presented the issues and pointed out that :\n\n\"the issue that must be determined is whether there exists a generally tainted background that necessarily renders a decision unlawful, even if substantive grounds may exist for such a decision. This background includes, but is not limited to, the question of procedural irregularities.\"\n\n7.32.\n\nThe TRIBUNAL then proceeded to review the facts concerning the origins of the revocation decision and related actions by Indonesian authorities (Paragraphs 76-97 of the SECOND AWARD). While treating the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S finding of lack of due process as res judicata, the SECOND TRIBUNAL attributed particular importance to each of the procedural irregularities involved. It formulated its conclusion (Paragraph 98) in the terms used earlier (Paragraph 75, quoted above), adding \"bad faith\" as the specific quality that has \"tainted\" the decision\u2019s background :\n\n\"The Tribunal finds that the whole approach to the issue of revocation of the license was tainted by bad faith, reflected in events and procedures.\"\n\n7.33.\n\nThe TRIBUNAL sought to determine the legal consequences of a \"tainted background\", first in its findings on Indonesian administrative law (already quoted above, Paragraph 7.18) and then in its consideration of international law authorities (Paragraphs 124-129 of the SECOND AWARD). Most of the international law cases considered are in fact dismissed as not apposite, in view of their lack of relevance to the possibility of \"a tainted background\" and of \"bad faith\". In concluding the analysis of the three cases it found most pertinent (Paragraphs 130-136 of the SECOND AWARD), the Tribunal introduced for the first time in the AWARD the notion of a denial of justice, stating (Paragraph 136) :\n\n\"the question in international law is not whether procedural irregularities generate damages per se. Rather, the international law test is whether there has been a denial of justice. [The cases] show equally that not every procedural irregularity constitutes a denial of justice.\"\n\n7.34.\n\nIn the next paragraph, the SECOND TRIBUNAL reformulated the issue it was seeking to decide in the following terms (Paragraph 137 of the SECOND AWARD) :\n\n\"whether the procedural irregularities and other background factors in this case amounted to a denial of justice, that would taint the decision of BKPM, regardless of whether BKPM might have had substantive grounds for its action against AMCO.\"\n\n7.35.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL next addressed the question whether a denial of justice may occur because of acts of an administrative body rather then a judicial one. It answered in the affirmative, although in not very strong terms (Paragraph 137 of the SECOND AWARD) :\n\n\"... the Tribunal sees no provision of international law that makes impossible a denial of justice by an administrative body. BKPM was an administrative, rather than a strictly judicial, body. It has not been argued to us by Indonesia that the acts of BKPM, taken in context, could not themselves constitute a wrong in international law, if unlawful...\"\n\n7.36.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL then reviewed further the several tests it had found in the cases discussed and concluded (Paragraph 137 of the SECOND AWARD) that, whatever test one might apply,\n\n\"... it can be seen that the BKPM handling of PT Wisma\u2019s complaint... constituted a denial of justice.\"\n\nIt next proceeded to restate its conclusions of law, using the notion of \"taint\" that it had employed earlier (Paragraph 138) :\n\n\"There are thus indications, both as a matter of Indonesian and international law, that the circumstances surrounding BKPM\u2019s decision tainted it irrevocably. \"\n\nAnd then stated its final finding (Paragraph 139), again using terms it had used earlier in the AWARD :\n\n\"The Tribunal therefore finds that, although certain substantive grounds might have existed for the revocation of the license, the circumstances surrounding BKPM\u2019s decision make it unlawful.\"\n\n7.37.\n\nThe Respondent focusses its attack primarily on the use by the Tribunal of the notion of denial of justice, while also contesting the other two key terms, \"tainted background\" and \"bad faith\". By reformulating and eventually deciding the issue in such terms, INDONESIA argued, the SECOND TRIBUNAL has manifestly exceeded its powers in several respects : First, it has infringed on the res judicata character of the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019s findings as to procedural defects, since denial of justice is a legal notion different from that of procedural defects. Secondly, the SECOND TRIBUNAL has invented the notion of an \"administrative\" denial of justice, which does not exist in international law. And finally, by using notions such as \"taint\" which are not established in either Indonesian or international law, it has in reality decided the case not on legal grounds but ex aequo et bono.\n\n7.38.\n\nAs the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE in this case has pointed out, in dealing with an award, a Committee must \"examine closely both what the Tribunal said it was doing and what it was in fact doing, in resolving particular questions\". (Paragraph 24 of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE decision). It is thus necessary to start by examining more closely the manner in which the AWARD deals with the role of the procedural defects in the investment license revocation and the meaning and function in the AWARD of the three key terms repeatedly mentioned, namely \"tainted background\" (and \"taint\"), \"bad faith\" and \"denial of justice\". On the basis of this discussion, it will be possible to deal with other aspects of the Respondent\u2019s submissions.\n\n7.39.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL states more than once that the issue is not the mere presence of procedural irregularities (cf. the quotations in Paragraphs 7.23, 7.24 and 7.25 above). What is important, according to the TRIBUNAL, is the specific character of the irregularities, their quality and kind. It is for this reason that the TRIBUNAL reviews once again the concrete instances of irregularities, already established by the factual findings of the FIRST TRIBUNAL and treated in toto as res judicata. From this review, the TRIBUNAL concludes that the procedural defects in question are of such a character that they may form the basis of an award of damages. In seeking to express the particular quality of the defects in procedure, the TRIBUNAL invokes the terms and notions mentioned in the preceding paragraph.\n\n7.40.\n\nThe graphic expression \"taint\" or \"tainted background\" is not, as far as the COMMITTEE can recall, a term of art in international law (or for that matter in domestic legal systems). In the AWARD under consideration, it is used to refer to the treatment of AMCO by the Indonesian authorities, as manifested by the totality of their actions, described in both the FIRST and SECOND AWARDS : support of P.T. Wisma, inaction with respect to the takeover of the hotel by police and army forces, haste and lack of serious consideration in the procedure of the revocation of AMCO\u2019S investment license. It is the specific, globally negative character of that attitude (also qualified as \"bad faith\", see the next Paragraph) that provides the \"taint\" to the \"background\", that is to say to the entire complex of Indonesian government actions toward AMCO. The notion is thus used to express the TRIBUNAL\u2019S negative conclusions as to the quality of the procedural defects in the license revocation process.\n\n7.41.\n\nThe term \"bad faith\", \"reflected in events and procedures\", cannot be seen as a particularly good choice of a word for referring to the quality of the actions by Indonesian authorities. The term is commonly used to refer to the absence of good faith. Such considerations do not arise here, however, since the existence of good faith cannot preclude wrongfulness or entail any exonerating effect upon an otherwise internationally wrongful act, especially one that arises out of the lack of proper procedural treatment. Nor does bad faith, in the normal sense of the term, make unlawful otherwise proper procedures. What the TRIBUNAL obviously means here, in a legal conclusion, is that procedures were deliberately defective, that the revocation procedure was distorted by an effort to utilize it toward a predetermined end. A term like \"abuse of process\" may be seen as equivalent in effect and perhaps more appropriate. In view, however, of the limited use of the term as well as of its context, it is hard to see in this anything beyond an inappropriate choice of word.\n\n7.42.\n\nThe term \"denial of justice\" appears at first blush as more central to the TRIBUNAL\u2019S reasoning than the other two terms examined. Its use and application by the SECOND TRIBUNAL, however, are not devoid of problems. Some of these problems may be attributed to imperfections in the drafting of the SECOND AWARD, which result in a less than fully consistent use of terms and a somewhat unclear structuring of the argument. Most of the problems, however, are inherent in the notion in question rather than the result of its use by the TRIBUNAL. Denial of justice is, of course, an old and venerable international law term, at one time very much in use by international lawyers. But it is a term with multiple meanings and usages, with no settled content, despite the efforts and suggestions of judges and scholars. It is noteworthy that the term is nowadays much less frequently used in diplomatic correspondence, injudicial decisions and arbitral awards as well as in doctrinal writings than it was a few decades ago.\n\n7.43.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL has not explained the exact sense in which it is using this term. As the excerpts quoted above (e.g., Paragraphs 7.31, 7.32 and 7.34) make clear, it uses \"denial of justice\" sometimes as a synonym for, and sometimes as an element of, the notion of a \"tainted background\". It is sometimes a conclusion and at other times one of the reasons for the conclusion. The term serves to provide the additional characterization needed to establish the unlawfulness of the procedural irregularities in the license revocation. This use is not inconsistent with the manner in which the term is commonly used in international law, although it is not the only possible one.\n\n7.44.\n\nAmong the several senses in which the term \"denial of justice\" is used in international law literature and case-law, several discrete meanings may be distinguished, three of which seem particularly relevant to present concerns. (See, e.g., the long list of uses of the term in O.J. Lissitzyn, \"The Meaning of the Term Denial of Justice in International Law\", 30 American Journal of International Law 632 (1936) and the shorter list in G.G. Fitzmaurice, \"The Meaning of the Term \"Denial of Justice\", British Yearbook of International Law 93 (1932)). According to a first meaning, a denial of justice occurs when an alien is not granted appropriate access to judicial organs or remedies; it follows that at the root of a denial of justice in this sense there is in all cases an act (or omission) of the judiciary. According to a second meaning, closely related to the first, a denial of justice may occur because of acts by any government organ, not only judicial ones. A third sense, finally, fuses the term essentially as a synonym for an internationally wrongful (or unlawful) act. (See in this sense C.C. Hyde, 2, International Law, rev. ed. 1945, page 909.)\n\n7.45.\n\nIn the instant case, it is not immediately apparent in which of these senses the SECOND TRIBUNAL is using the term. Its discussion of the possibility of an \"administrative\" denial of justice (Paragraph 137 of the SECOND AWARD, supra Paragraph 7.33) would seem to suggest that the term is used in the second sense. Closer study of the AWARD, however, suggests that it is rather in the third, and most general sense that the TRIBUNAL is using the term most of the time (even if with some inconsistencies).\n\n7.46.\n\nIt is important to note that the Tribunal refrains from using the notion of denial of justice at the start of its inquiry, when it first formulates its central question, as well as at the very end, when it offers its final conclusion. At the start, it states : \"The issue... is whether there exists a generally tainted background that necessarily renders a decision unlawful, even if substantive grounds may exist\" (Paragraph 75 of the SECOND AWARD). Some sixty paragraphs later, it concludes, \"although certain substantive grounds might have existed..., the circumstances surrounding BKPM\u2019s decision make it unlawful\" (Paragraph 139).\n\n7.47.\n\nIt appears therefore that the central notion in the SECOND AWARD, the one that is indispensable for its reasoning, is the more general notion of unlawfulness and not the notion of a denial of justice, in any particular sense. The TRIBUNAL seeks to determine whether the governmental acts involved constitute internationally unlawful acts. Lack of due process, a tainted background, or even bad faith (in the sense the term is employed in the AWARD, see supra Paragraph 7.41) are elements which directly or indirectly render an act unlawful. Denial of justice, as well, appears to be a shorthand way to refer to those characteristics of an act which render it unlawful \u2014 in this instance, the deliberate use of procedures to bring about a predetermined outcome, regardless of the possible existence of substantive grounds for the outcome. It is true that, as has been pointed out in the literature, this is not a very useful way of employing the term denial of justice; it is, however, a fairly common and established way.\n\n7.48.\n\nIt follows from this understanding of the reasoning of the SECOND AWARD that the use of the notion of denial of justice by the TRIBUNAL does not constitute a manifest excess of powers. From beginning to end, the SECOND TRIBUNAL was trying to determine whether an internationally unlawful act had occurred. In the process, it used the notion of denial of justice, as a synonym for, or an element leading to, the object of its efforts. The latter remained fixed and clear : the lawfulness vel non of the Indonesian Government\u2019s actions, more specifically the procedural treatment of AMCO with respect to the revocation of its investment license. Defining the object of its quest in terms of wrongfulness or unlawfulness is an appropriate way of proceeding for the Tribunal in deciding the dispute between the PARTIES. The COMMITTEE finds moreover that this object is strictly legal in character and in no way constitutes a departure from the Tribunal\u2019s normal legal task and an endeavor to decide the case ex aequo et bono.\n\n7.49.\n\nIn dealing with the findings of the FIRST TRIBUNAL concerning the procedural defects of the license revocation process, the SECOND TRIBUNAL has not infringed upon the principle of finality. While treating the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S finding of lack of due process as res judicata, it has attributed particular importance to each and all of the procedural irregularities in the revocation process. The Respondent complains that this \"reworking\" of the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S findings amounts to a redetermination of the issues, especially in view of the new notions introduced by the SECOND TRIBUNAL, such as \"tainted background\", \"denial of justice\", etc. A close study of the FIRST and SECOND AWARDS, however, indicates that, beyond a marked difference in style and terminology, there are few, if any, significant differences in the findings that they utilize and to which they give effect (apart, of course, from the examination of the substantive grounds for the revocation, found only in the FIRST AWARD). It has to be stressed that the fundamental finding of lack of \"due process\" is found expressis verbis in the FIRST AWARD. The SECOND TRIBUNAL\u2019S reference to a denial of justice may indeed be seen as but a reformulation of that finding. Furthermore, the view that liability can be based on this finding alone is also found, albeit not unambiguously, in the FIRST AWARD, or at the very least (in view of the diverse interpretations possible) is not rejected by it.\n\n7.50.\n\nFinally, in view of the reasoning in the preceding paragraphs, the use in the SECOND AWARD of the notion of a denial of justice by the Tribunal does not, in the COMMITTEE\u2019S view, constitute a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, since reference to \u00b1is notion did not involve invocation of a new cause of action but mere reiteration of the charge of unlawfulness. Moreover, the term itself had been used during the proceedings before the SECOND TRIBUNAL although it did not seem to have attracted much attention or debate (AMCO Counter-Memorial to Indonesia\u2019s Annulment Application, July 5, 1991, pp. 63-65).\n\nD. ADMISSION OF NEW EVIDENCE AND ITS TREATMENT\n----------------------------------------------\n\n7.51.\n\nGiven the peculiar posture in which the dispute had reached the SECOND TRIBUNAL, after the partial annulment of the FIRST AWARD, the Tribunal had to move carefully between elements of the dispute before it which had been decided by the FIRST TRIBUNAL and were not annulled, and therefore left standing as res judicata, and elements which were open for redetermination by the SECOND TRIBUNAL. The Tribunal determined in its Decision on Jurisdiction (Paragraph 7.14 above) that, while the FIRST AWARD\u2019S determination that procedural irregularities had marked the revocation of AMCO\u2019S investment license as res judicata, the award of damages and the consequent calculation of their amount were open for redetermination. The admission of new evidence with respect to an issue which was res judicata (namely, the presence and extent of lack of due process) would have been inappropriate, since the SECOND TRIBUNAL would be exceeding its powers if it were to redecide that issue. On the other hand, since the SECOND TRIBUNAL had to decide the issue of damages, it could and did accept new evidence with respect to that issue.\n\n7.52.\n\nThe actual import of the new evidence submitted by the Respondent is another question altogether, since one might easily perceive much of the new evidence as merely showing that AMCO had been diligent in seeking to reverse the revocation decision. The receipt by Indonesian authorities of letters protesting the revocation can hardly be considered as evidence that remedies were available or were provided, although meetings with Indonesian officials and other Indonesian Government responses to AMCO\u2019S complaints, however eventually frustrating to the latter, may be seen as being in the nature of remedial steps. Their actual import, however, in tempering the procedural defects that had been found to exist was for the SECOND TRIBUNAL to determine. Once again, it must be noted that the quality or correctness of the judgement of the Tribunal in dealing with this or other questions is not at issue in an annulment proceeding. The issue here is whether the SECOND TRIBUNAL seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in the manner in which it dealt with the new evidence submitted by the Respondent. And the COMMITTEE finds that it did not so depart.\n\nE. AMCO\u2019S DISCREDITABLE ACTS\n----------------------------\n\n7.53.\n\nThe Respondent has further submitted that the SECOND TRIBUNAL has seriously departed from the fundamental rule of procedure that the Parties be treated equally in that it treated the evidence in an \"unbalanced\" manner, disregarding or attributing little importance to AMCO\u2019S failures and discreditable acts while emphasizing Indonesia\u2019s failure to follow procedures. The SECOND TRIBUNAL, however, devotes a fairly lengthy section of its AWARD (Paragraphs 99-112) to detailing AMCO\u2019S \"discreditable acts\" in its dealing with the Government of Indonesia. It takes pains, in fact, to distinguish in this respect its own position from that of the FIRST TRIBUNAL, pointing out that \"matters... are less black and white\" for it than for the FIRST TRIBUNAL and noting that \"the evidence also reflects discreditably on Amco\" (Paragraph 99 of the SECOND AWARD). In its conclusion (Paragraph 112), it accepts \"that PT Amco\u2019s behaviour contained discreditable features\" and goes on to assert that \"that fact could not justify BKPM\u2019s approach to the question of revocation\" (emphasis added). It cannot be said therefore that the SECOND TRIBUNAL has not considered AMCO\u2019S conduct in this respect. The term it has chosen to use in its conclusion, moreover, is significant : AMCO\u2019S conduct does not \"justify\" BKPM\u2019s \"approach\", that is to say, the lack of due process in the revocation of the license. One might or might not read into that term an acknowledgement that AMCO\u2019S conduct may have been a factor in BKPM\u2019s decision. The point is, however, that to the extent that AMCO\u2019S conduct may be relevant, it pertains to the substantive grounds for revocation of the license, not to the procedure, with which the SECOND TRIBUNAL was dealing in its AWARD. The SECOND TRIBUNAL thus concluded that AMCO\u2019S failings, however discreditable, do not \"justify\" the Indonesian Government\u2019s departure from basic procedural norms. That judgement of the Tribunal, while laconically, even lapidarily formulated, is well within the ambit of its powers, nor can it be said that, read in context, it requires the formulation of additional reasons in support or explanation.\n\nF. FAILURE TO STATE REASONS\n---------------------------\n\n7.54.\n\nThe Respondent finally submits that the SECOND TRIBUNAL has failed to state reasons for its decision in a number of instances, where the reasons it has provided are not, according to the Respondent, clear or complete enough (see Supra, Paragraphs 5,195.21).\n\n7.55.\n\nOne significant point argued by the PARTIES and contested in the oral hearings of December 9-11, 1991 relates to the interpretation of Article 52 (1) (e) of the CONVENTION: specifically whether there is an additional requirement that the reasons stated be also \"sufficiently pertinent\". The standards of international arbitral propriety lead the COMMITTEE to adhere in this particular connection, to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969. The wording of Sub-paragraph (1) (e) of Article 52 does not permit an interpretation beyond the \"ordinary meaning\" of the term used in the context and in the light of the object and purpose of the CONVENTION. The COMMITTEE can find no justification for adding a further requirement that the reasons stated be \"sufficiently pertinent\". To add such a phrase would be to amend the clear and unambiguous text of Article 52 (1) (e). The COMMITTEE has neither authority nor inclination to introduce any amendment to or modification of the provisions of the CONVENTION. Furthermore, the COMMITTEE must resist the temptation of arrogating to itself the power to review or to correct the decision of the SECOND TRIBUNAL. To require the sufficiency of pertinent reasons as distinguished from their mere existence, is to provide an Ad Hoc Committee with an unwarranted opportunity to act as a Court of Appeal. This the COMMITTEE will not do.\n\n7.56.\n\nThe COMMITTEE observes, however, that not every gap or ambiguity in a judgement constitutes a failure to state reasons. As was noted in the Introduction to this Decision (Paragraph 1.18 above), the ground for annulment in Article 52 (1) (e) of the CONVENTION is applicable where no reasons at all are given or where the reasons given are inconsistent or so weak as to be frivolous. While the SECOND TRIBUNAL is sometimes laconic in its reasons or not totally clear in its reasoning, this does not constitute failure to state reasons and the COMMITTEE is not disposed to find otherwise.\n\n7.57.\n\nStatements have to be read in context. The \"reasons\" for a position or a statement may be found in the developments that follow. Thus, the SECOND TRIBUNAL\u2019S restatement of the central issue (Paragraph 75 of the SECOND AWARD) is explained by the elaborate developments that follow, including, for example, its analysis of the case-law in the light of the reformulation (Paragraphs 122-135 of the SECOND AWARD). It is not necessary, moreover, for a Tribunal to explain each and every statement and conclusion it has reached, e.g., in determining the import of case-law (Paragraphs 122-136 of the SECOND AWARD), or to spell out in mechanistic detail the manner in which a causal connection it finds to exist operates in abstracto in view of hypothetical possibilities (Paragraph 174 of the SECOND AWARD). Once again, possible misapplication of legal rules does not constitute a ground for annulment, especially in terms of a failure to state reasons.\n\n7.58.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to the Respondent\u2019s submission that the SECOND TRIBUNAL failed to state reasons for its rejection of INDONESIA\u2019S tax concessions counter-claims. This has not been a central issue in the SECOND AWARD, nor indeed in the Parties\u2019 submissions to the COMMITTEE. In fact, the SECOND AWARD dealt repeatedly and in some detail with the facts and the law concerning actions by AMCO on which the counter-claims were based. It concluded however that, while some of them might have formed the basis for lawful revocation of AMCO\u2019S investment license and for the Government claims arising out of such revocation, they could not by themselves form the basis for annulment when the revocation itself was found to be lawful. The argument is cogent and reasons are in no way absent.\n\nII. THE APPLICATION BY AMCO FOR ANNULMENT IN PART OF THE AWARD OF JUNE 5, 1990\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. REDETERMINATION OF THE NATURE OF THE PREJUDICE SUFFERED BY AMCO AS THE RESULT OF THE ARMY AND POLICE ACTIONS ON MARCH 31/APRIL 1, 1980\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.01.\n\nIn AMCO\u2019S contention, the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S finding that the army and police actions on March 31/April 1, 1980, deprived AMCO of future income from April 1, 1980, is res judicata (Paragraph 6.01 above). The SECOND TRIBUNAL, however, decided that the only prejudice AMCO has suffered was a general disturbance.\n\n8.02.\n\nIn order to appreciate the res judicata character of the issue in question, it is necessary to take into consideration the relevant statements of the three successive ICSID bodies which have been called upon to consider this case, namely, the FIRST TRIBUNAL, the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE and the SECOND TRIBUNAL.\n\n8.03.\n\nThe FIRST TRIBUNAL made the following statement on the nature of the prejudice suffered by AMCO from the army and police actions :\n\n\"257. The dispossession as such did not have any legal effect : it merely created a de facto situation, which was the actual deprivation of P.T. AMCO of the management and operation of the hotel, and of the daily cash flow the company received by exercising its rights.\n\nAccordingly, while it is right to say that the Claimants\u2019 deprivation of the right they had acquired did not result from this de facto dispossession, the fact of the matter is that the actual prejudice they suffered, consisting in the deprivation of the profit they were entitled to expect by exercising said rights, commenced on April 1, 1980, and that at this date, the cause of the prejudice was the dispossession : in other words, during this very first stage, there was effectively a causal link between the dispossession and the prejudice.\"\n\n(FIRST AWARD, Paragraph 257)\n\n8.04.\n\nThe FIRST TRIBUNAL awarded AMCO damages of US$ 3,200,000.00 for both the prejudices resulting from the army and police actions and for the revocation of the investment license, assuming that there existed a single causal link between these two events.\n\n8.05.\n\nThe FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE found that, while the army and police actions were illegal and entailed Indonesia\u2019s responsibility, the revocation of the investment license was a lawful response of Indonesia to certain failures of AMCO. Not being entitled to determine what portion of the indemnity fixed by the FIRST TRIBUNAL was attributable to the prejudice caused by the army and police actions, the Committee annulled the \"Tribunal\u2019s findings on the amount of damages as a whole\" (Decision of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE, Paragraph 110). In the dispositif of its decision, the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE stated that it\n\n\"annuls the Award as a whole for the reasons and with the qualifications set out above.\"\n\nIt added :\n\n\"The annulment does not extend to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the action of Army and Police personnel on March 31/April 1, 1980, was illegal. The annulment extends, however, to the findings on the duration of such illegality and on the amount of the indemnity due on this account.\"\n\n8.06.\n\nThe SECOND TRIBUNAL understood this Annulment as embracing both the determination of the nature of the prejudice suffered by AMCO from the army and police actions and the quantification thereof (SECOND AWARD, paragraph 46). In redetermining these issues, it found that the army and police actions prevented AMCO from exercising its right to management and control of the hotel and from access to its cash flow but did not deprive it of the right to its share of the profit under the 1978 Profit-Sharing Agreement (Paragraph 165). It further found that AMCO\u2019S access to the cash flow of the hotel was fiduciary in nature and its loss could not therefore cause AMCO any prejudice (Paragraphs 61, 165). It awarded AMCO a compensation of US$ 10,000.00 for general disturbance only. As to the question of the res judicata character of the determination of the nature of the prejudice, the SECOND TRIBUNAL stated that the wording of Paragraph 257 of the FIRST AWARD (quoted above) concerning the deprivation of future income by the army and police actions was not entirely clear. In its opinion, Paragraph 257 of the FIRST AWARD either refers to a \" de facto inability to receive, from April to July 1980, its share of the profits under the 1978 Agreement\" or is supposed to say \"that the legal right to secure profits from the Hotel Kartika venture was ultimately lost by the revocation decree of July 9, the path to which began with the dispossession of March 31 - April 1\" (Paragraph 49). The decisive element for the SECOND TRIBUNAL in its finding on the res judicata issue seems to have been the fact that the Ad Hoc Committee had annulled the FIRST AWARD \"as a whole\" and excluded from the annulment only \"the finding that the action of the Army and Police personnel... was illegal\" but not the further questions dealt with in Paragraph 257 of the FIRST AWARD (Paragraph 50 of the SECOND AWARD).\n\n8.07.\n\nArbitration Rule 55 (3) states : \"If the original award had only been annulled in part, the new Tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled\". If a new Tribunal reconsiders an issue not annulled, it exceeds its powers. In the present case the FIRST COMMITTEE had not taken any explicit decision on the controversial issue of the nature of the prejudice caused by the army and police actions. The SECOND TRIBUNAL therefore had to interpret the Committee\u2019s decision with regard to this issue. Its interpretation could be considered as a manifest excess of powers only if it were manifestly outside any bona fide interpretation of the FIRST COMMITTEE\u2019S decision and therefore obviously untenable.\n\n8.08.\n\nAn Ad Hoc Committee in an annulment proceeding is not entitled to decide which one of several possible interpretations of an annulment decision, among which the Tribunal could choose, was preferable. It has simply to ascertain whether the Tribunal whose award is challenged acted in manifest breach of its competence. The International Court of Justice, in its Judgement of November 12, 1991, concerning the Arbitral Award of July 31, 1989, between Guinea-Bissau and Senegal, stated to similar effect :\n\n\"The Court does not have to enquire whether or not the Arbitration Agreement could, with regard to the Tribunal\u2019s competence, be interpreted in a number of ways, and if so to consider which would have been preferable. By proceeding in that way the Court would be treating the request as an appeal and not as a recours en nullit\u00e9. The Court could not act in that way in the present case. It has simply to ascertain whether by rendering the disputed Award the Tribunal acted in manifest breach of the competence conferred on it by the Arbitration Agreement, either by deciding in excess of, or by failing to exercise, its jurisdiction.\"\n\n(ICJ Reports 1991, page 69, Paragraph 47)\n\n8.09.\n\nIf one follows the statements of the three ICSID bodies reproduced above, no manifest excess of powers attributable to the SECOND TRIBUNAL can be established. The FIRST COMMITTEE annulled the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S \"findings on the amount of damages as a whole\" (Paragraph 110 of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S Decision) and annulled the Award \"as a whole... with the qualifications set out above\". It stated that the annulment did not extend to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the actions of army and police personnel was illegal, but extended to the findings on the duration of such illegality and the amount of the indemnity due on this account. No mention was made in this context of the nature of the prejudice suffered by AMCO from the army and police actions and of AMCO\u2019S deprivation of future profits. The FIRST COMMITTEE\u2019S decision annulling \"the amount of the indemnity as a whole\" could therefore, without any manifest excess of powers, be interpreted as including the nature and assessment of damages for the prejudice.\n\n8.10.\n\nThe COMMITTEE concludes accordingly that the SECOND TRIBUNAL did not manifestly exceed its powers by reascertaining the nature of the prejudice caused AMCO by army and police personnel for the purpose of quantification of compensation for the loss suffered.\n\nB. REDETERMINATION OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES DUE AMCO FOR THE ARMY AND POLICE ACTIONS ON MARCH 31/APRIL 1, 1980, AND THE REVOCATION OF AMCO\u2019S INVESTMENT LICENSE ON JULY 9, 1980\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.11.\n\nAMCO advances several arguments for its contention that the SECOND TRIBUNAL exceeded its powers in redetermining the aggregate amount of damages due AMCO.\n\n8.12.\n\nFirst, AMCO alleges that the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE had not annulled any aspect of the damages quantification (Paragraphs 6.04-6.05 above). This argument coincides with the argument put forward under Section A. above where the Committee found that the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE\u2019S decision annulling the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S \"findings on the amount of damages as a whole\" could without any manifest excess of powers be understood as including the calculation or quantification of the damages.\n\n8.13.\n\nAccording to a second argument put forward by AMCO, INDONESIA had not sought the annulment of the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S quantification of the amount of damages to be paid to AMCO. This argument proves to be irrelevant since INDONESIA had requested the annulment of the findings on its liability and thereby implicitly also sought the annulment of the damages to be paid to AMCO. Moreover, the argument cannot be heard since the FIRST COMMITTEE\u2019S decision, which annulled the damages as a whole, is not reviewable.\n\n8.14.\n\nThird, AMCO argues that the SECOND TRIBUNAL reestablished the liability of INDONESIA on essentially the same grounds as the FIRST TRIBUNAL had done, so that the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S quantification should also be reestablished. Although the SECOND TRIBUNAL would have been free to reintroduce the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S quantification of damages, it was not bound to do so since the quantification had been annulled as a whole.\n\n8.15.\n\nA further point needs attention, the only one of the points advanced by AMCO not yet covered by the preceding considerations. AMCO contends that the date for the conversion of rupiahs to dollars, as fixed by the FIRST TRIBUNAL, was res judicata. The date was April 1, 1980. The FIRST TRIBUNAL had fixed this date, considering that, according to international law, the relevant date is the date the damages occurred (FIRST AWARD, Paragraph 280). The FIRST COMMITTEE decided that it was res judicata that \"the applicable date for converting to U.S. dollars any damages expressed in rupiahs is \"the date the damage occurred\" (Decision of the FIRST AD HOC COMMITTEE, Paragraph 120). The SECOND TRIBUNAL confirmed this in its Decision on Jurisdiction (Paragraphs 66-67). In its main Award, the SECOND TRIBUNAL used another method for the valuation of the Hotel profits than that adopted by the FIRST TRIBUNAL. By this method, the Tribunal converted AMCO\u2019S profits to U.S. dollars at the prevailing yearly rates for the period July 9, 1980 to December 31, 1989, and at the 1989 rate for the period January 1, 1990 to September 1999 (SECOND AWARD, Paragraph 284.4, also Paragraphs 252-253).\n\n8.16.\n\nThe rule that damages are to be paid at the exchange rate of the date the damage occurred, is intended to prevent devaluation of the amount of compensation which is calculated in the currency of the State where the damages occurred but is payable in a foreign currency, owing to the fact that the first currency depreciates at a higher rate than does the currency in which the indemnity is to be paid. The rule in question is not intended to imply, however, that the indemnity for lost income of future years is to be paid at a higher exchange rate than the rate of the year in which the income is earned. The SECOND TRIBUNAL stated that the objective is \"to put AMCO in the position it would have been in had its contract been performed\" (SECOND AWARD, Paragraph 253). In its SUPPLEMENTAL DECISION of October 17, 1990, Paragraphs 1 and 2, the SECOND TRIBUNAL affirmed its reasoning in the following way :\n\n\"In its Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal had affirmed that the applicable date for converting to U.S. dollars any damage expressed in rupiahs is the date that the damage occurred. The Tribunal has made it clear in its Award that what was lost was a share in a stream of profit. The damage was necessarily year by year damage. At paragraphs 252-253 of its Award of June 5, 1990, the Tribunal explained the basis of the year by year exchange rate to be applied in converting rupiahs to U.S. dollars for purposes of calculating damages.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s decision was fully compatible with the res judicata referred to by AMCO.\"\n\nA calculation which corresponds to this reasoning does not violate the aforementioned rule which is considered to be res judicata. Such is the finding of the COMMITTEE.\n\n8.17.\n\nA final point is to be examined : INDONESIA contends that AMCO, in the proceedings before the SECOND TRIBUNAL, had consistently interpreted the calculation of damages as having been annulled by the FIRST COMMITTEE. In INDONESIA\u2019S view, AMCO is therefore estopped from asserting the contrary. INDONESIA asserts, inter alia, that in its resubmission of the dispute to the SECOND TRIBUNAL AMCO claimed a sum of US$ 15,000,000.00 as compensation for the acts of the army and police and expressly affirmed that \"the annulment did extend to the amount of compensation due\" (INDONESIA\u2019S Counter-Memorial, July 5, 1991, pages 33-39). INDONESIA refers to Arbitration Rule 41 stating that \"Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible\". Rule 41 fixes as the time limit the date of the filing of the Counter-Memorial. In the present case, INDONESIA alleges, this would have been September 12, 1988, i.e. the time limit set for the Counter-Memorial before the SECOND TRIBUNAL (Ibid., page 36).\n\n8.18.\n\nThe question raised by INDONESIA can be left open. As the COMMITTEE has come to the conclusion that the SECOND TRIBUNAL could without any manifest excess of powers consider the calculation of the indemnity for the army and police actions as having been annulled by the FIRST COMMITTEE there is no need to determine whether or not AMCO is estopped from contending that the FIRST TRIBUNAL\u2019S calculation was res judicata. There is accordingly no basis for AMCO\u2019S request for annulment in this particular respect.\n\nIII. THE APPLICATION BY INDONESIA FOR ANNULMENT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD OF OCTOBER 17, 1990\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS\n----------------------------\n\n9.01.\n\nINDONESIA contends that the SECOND TRIBUNAL, in adopting its SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD, did not simply rectify a clerical, arithmetical or similar error, as required by Article 49 (2) of the CONVENTION, but reconsidered the valuation to be given to the Aeropacific assets in violation of Article 52 (1) (b) of the CONVENTION (manifest excess of powers).\n\n9.02.\n\nAn ICSID award is binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to any other remedy except those provided for in the CONVENTION (Article 53 (1) of the CONVENTION). One of these exceptions is the rectification of \"any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award\" (Article 49 (2)). Such an error can consist in inadvertent mistakes in spelling, in dates, in miscalculations, etc. (INDONESIA\u2019S Application for Annulment of the Supplemental Award' February 14, 1991, page 13).\n\n9.03.\n\nThe SECOND AWARD contains two diverging figures for the book value of the Aeropacific assets. Paragraphs 221 and 222 mention the figure of Rp. 421,451,054, while the table annexed to Paragraph 284 on pages 170 and 171 of the AWARD leads to a sum of Rp. 625,730,000. (The correct figure, however, resulting from the addition of Rp. 566,940,000 and 59,790,000, as indicated on pages 170 and 171, column 7, of the SECOND AWARD, is Rp. 626,730,000. This possible mistake has no further consequence since the Tribunal decided to rely on the lower of the two valuations.) It is obvious that the Tribunal did not notice the divergence between the two figures used for the same assets. Otherwise it would have corrected the mistake. The divergence was clearly inadvertent. INDONESIA does not claim the contrary. It alleges that the Tribunal made an ex post facto reasoning and changed its original decision. INDONESIA bases its allegation on the expression \"The Tribunal... has preferred\", used in the Supplemental Award on page 3. It suggests that this expression refers to the rectification phase, not to the time when the Tribunal adopted its Award. It is difficult to follow this reasoning. The Tribunal\u2019s expression may not have been fortunate, but it evidently refers to the time when the Tribunal rendered its Award. There are no indications whatsoever, which would allow the conclusion that the Tribunal had changed its mind and departed from its earlier decision. On the contrary, the two paragraphs of the AWARD which are devoted to the Aeropacific assets (Paragraphs 221 and 222) mention the lower of the two sums, i.e., the sum fixed in the Supplemental Award. These two paragraphs were the result of the Tribunal\u2019s deliberations whereas the tables reproduced on pages 170-171, showing the higher figures, were established by accounting experts. The Tribunal seems to have overlooked that the tables were no longer correct after it had decided to rely on the lower figures. Although the Tribunal\u2019s inadvertence had considerable consequences for the PARTIES, this does not affect its character as an error in the sense of Article 49 (2).\n\n9.04.\n\nIt follows that INDONESIA\u2019S claim that the SECOND TRIBUNAL manifestly exceeded its powers must be dismissed.\n\nB. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.05.\n\nArticle 49 (2) of the CONVENTION provides that the Tribunal may, upon request of a party and \"after notice to the other party\", rectify any clerical or similar error. Arbitration Rule 49 (4) specifies : \"The Tribunal shall fix a time limit for the parties to file their observations on the request and shall determine the procedure for its consideration\". (This is Rule 49 (3) in the Revised Arbitration Rules applicable to proceedings after September 26, 1984). The SECOND TRIBUNAL, after having received AMCO\u2019S request of July 20, 1990, for supplemental decisions, did not fix a time limit for INDONESIA\u2019s submission of its observations on the request. Nevertheless, INDONESIA received a copy of AMCO\u2019S request from the Secretary-General of ICSID in accordance with Arbitration Rule 49 (3) (or Revised Rule 49 (2)). On August 14, 1990, INDONESIA addressed a letter to the Tribunal\u2019s President, Professor Rosalyn Higgins, urging the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction over the issues raised in AMCO\u2019S request. The letter stated that if the Tribunal should determine that further proceedings are appropriate, INDONESIA expressly reserves \"the right to make submissions on the substance of AMCO\u2019S July 20 Request before the Tribunal considers it on those grounds\" (page 12 of the letter).\n\n9.06.\n\nThe Tribunal did not fix a time limit, nor did it give reasons in the Supplemental Award for not doing so. Neither did it take note of INDONESIA\u2019S reservation to make further submissions. It only acknowledges that it \"considered... the Memorandum submitted by Indonesia on August 14, 1990\", but in its AWARD it never refers to INDONESIA\u2019S arguments. Thus, the Tribunal clearly departed from Arbitration Rule 49 (4).\n\n9.07.\n\nAccording to Article 52 (1) (d) of the CONVENTION, an Ad Hoc Committee has the authority to annul an award or any part of it if the departure from the rule of procedure is serious and if the rule is fundamental.\n\n9.08.\n\nThe mandatory rule in question, Rule 49 (4), requiring a time limit to be fixed for the Parties to file their observations must be considered as fundamental. If a Tribunal takes a decision on the request of a Party without giving the other Party an opportunity to express itself on that request, it does not treat the Parties equally. In MINE v. Guinea (ICSID CASE ARB/84/4), the Ad Hoc Committee considered the comparable provision of Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration as a clear example of a fundamental rule. This rule states : \"The parties shall be treated equally and each party shall be given full opportunity of presenting his case\" (Decision of December 14, 1989, 5 Foreign Investment Law Journal, 1990, Paragraph 5.06, page 104). An argument could be made that in the case of rectification of an apparent clerical, arithmetical or similar error, there is hardly any need to fix a time limit for the Parties to file their observations. However, Rule 49 (4) expressly requires that the Tribunal fix a time limit in such cases. This rule of procedure does not lose its fundamental character by the fact that the decision to be taken might seem apparent.\n\n9.09.\n\nAs to the question whether the departure from a rule is serious, the Ad Hoc Committee in MINE v. Guinea stated that the departure \"must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide\" (Ibid., page 104, Paragraph 5.05).\n\n9.10.\n\nIn the present ease, the serious nature of the departure can be affirmed on both counts. The Tribunal simply disregarded Arbitration Rule 49 (4). It did not even take note of its existence. Nor did it make any observation on INDONESIA\u2019S reservation presented in the letter of August 14, 1990. No doubt, INDONESIA had received AMCO\u2019S request and had taken the opportunity to address preliminary observations to the Tribunal contesting jurisdiction, but it was entitled to expect that a time limit would be fixed and an opportunity provided for INDONESIA to present its substantive defense, at any rate, when the Tribunal had not simply refused to exercise jurisdiction. The Tribunal summarily dismissed twelve of the thirteen grounds advanced by AMCO for supplementation and rectification except for one. It is in respect of this one that INDONESIA was therefore deprived of the benefit of the protection the rule is intended to provide. The fact that the decision to be taken seemed apparent cannot be considered as a justification for dispensation with a mandatory rule of procedure designed to guarantee equality of opportunity for the Parties to have their views heard on the issues to be addressed and decided by the Tribunal, nor is the matter merely de minimis. The COMMITTEE therefore concludes that the Tribunal, by omitting to fix a time limit to enable INDONESIA to file its observations on AMCO\u2019S request, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. On this ground, the SUPPLEMENTAL AWARD of October 17, 1990, cannot be left unannulled.\n\nC. FAILURE TO STATE REASONS\n---------------------------\n\n9.11.\n\nINDONESIA contends that the SECOND TRIBUNAL failed to state the reasons upon which \"its reconsideration of the asset valuation\" was based (INDONESIA\u2019S Application for Annulment of the Supplemental Award, February 14, 1991, pages 18-19) As previously stated, the SECOND TRIBUNAL did not exceed its power to rectify a clerical error. Its duty to state reasons (Article 48 (3) of the CONVENTION) was therefore confined to making plausible the assertion that the error was inadvertent and that the rectified figures corresponded to the decision it had taken when it adopted the Award.\n\n9.12.\n\nAs was stated in this connection, the SECOND TRIBUNAL in both instances gave sufficiently relevant indications of its reasons. No violation of the duty to state reasons can therefore be found.\n\n9.13.\n\nINDONESIA further contends that the Tribunal \"failed to state reasons for rejecting Indonesia\u2019s position with respect to the threshold jurisdictional objections raised in its Letter concerning Jurisdiction\" (Ibid., page 19). As the COMMITTEE has found it possible to annul the Supplemental Award because the SECOND TRIBUNAL had not given INDONESIA an opportunity to file its observations in compliance with Rule 49 (4) of the Arbitration Rules, the additional contention that the Tribunal had not stated reasons for not considering INDONESIA\u2019S objections is devoid of any object.\n\nIV. COSTS\n---------\n\n10.01.\n\nHaving regard to the fact that both PARTIES have submitted Applications for Annulment, and that they have maintained, throughout the entire proceedings, an equally high degree of self-restraint, patience and due diligence in cooperation with the COMMITTEE, thereby enabling the COMMITTEE to reach its conclusions without undue delay, the COMMITTEE finds that each of the PARTIES, AMCO as well as INDONESIA, should contribute in equal parts to the costs of the COMMITTEE and that each PARTY should bear its own costs for legal counsel.\n\n**PART FOUR - CONCLUSION**\n--------------------------\n\nDECISION OF THE COMMITTEE\n-------------------------\n\n[11].\n\nFor these reasons,\n\n**THE COMMITEE,**\n\nNoting that the stay of enforcement of the AWARD ordered by the COMMITTEE\u2019S Interim Order No, I terminates automatically as of the date of this Decision pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54 (3),\n\n**UNANIMOUSLY**\n\nA.\n\n(1) Rejects in its entirety INDONESIA\u2019S Application for Annulment of the AWARD of June 5, 1990;\n\n(2) Rejects in its entirety AMCO\u2019S Application for Annulment in Part of the AWARD of June 5, 1990; and\n\n(3) Finds consequently that the AWARD of June 5, 1990 is valid and binding for INDONESIA and AMCO, which have the obligation to apply it;\n\nB.
