(the \"**Claimant**\" or \"**ELA**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota and existing under the laws of the State of Florida, United States of America (\"**United States**\" or \"**U.S.**\"), with its registered address at 148 South Arabella Way, St. John, Florida 32259. The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Professor Barry Appleton of Appleton & Associates International Lawyers LP, 121 Richmond St. W, Suite 602, Toronto, Ontario M5H 2K1, Canada, and Mr. Edward Mullins of Reed Smith LLP, 200 S Biscayne Blvd., Suite 2600, Miami, Florida 33131, United States, and previously also by Ms. Nabeela Latif of Appleton & Associates International Lawyers LP and Ms. Cristina C\u00e1rdenas of Reed Smith LLP.\n\n2.\n\nThe respondent in this arbitration is the Republic of Estonia, a sovereign State (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Estonia**\" and, together with the Claimant, the \"**Parties**\"). The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by Ms. Kairit Kirsipuu, and previously by Ms. Elin Uusv\u00e4li, Mr. Marko Aavik and Mr. Viljar Peep, of the Ministry of Justice of Estonia, Suur-Ameerika 1, 10122 Tallinn, Estonia, and the following counsel: Mr. Toomas Vaher, Mr. Anton Sigal, Ms. Maria Teder, and Ms. Mailis Meier (until 1 November 2021) of Ellex Raidla Advokaadib\u00fcroo O\u00dc, Kaarli pst 1 / Roosikrantsi 2, EE-10119 Tallinn, Estonia.\n\n**B. Overview of the Dispute**\n------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe dispute arises out of the Claimant's alleged investments in a seaport in Tallinn, Estonia, known as the **Seaplane Harbor**, or *Lennusadam*, which the Claimant claims to have operated through its \u2014partly indirect\u2014subsidiaries, AS BPV (\"**BPV**\"), AS Verest (\"**Verest**\"), O\u00dc Agrin Partion (\"**Agrin**\"), and AS ELA Tolli (\"**ELA Tolli**\").1\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 16.\n\n4.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent improperly interfered with the Claimant's operation of its investments from 1999 through a combination of administrative and criminal actions, and use of discriminatory measures and physical force, in breach of the fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") standard, the most-favored-nation (\"**MFN**\") treatment standard, as well as the national treatment (\"**NT**\") standard under the Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Estonia Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, dated 19 April 1994, which entered into force on 16 February 1997 (the \"**Treaty**\" or \"**US-Estonia BIT**\").2 The Claimant further argues that the Respondent expropriated its alleged investments through the acts of the Estonian judiciary without paying compensation in breach of the Treaty.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 4-10.\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant's claims in their entirety.3 According to the Respondent, the Claimant's claims fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction and are inadmissible because: (i) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* under Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty because the true identity of the Claimant is unclear,4 and the only link between the Claimant and the alleged investments is Mr. Rotko, an Estonian national;5 (ii) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because the Claimant failed to prove ownership or control of investments in Estonia within the meaning of the Treaty,6 and the alleged investments were obtained illegally and in bad faith;7 (iii) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the Claimant's claims because they pertain to measures taken by the Respondent before the entry into force of the Treaty on 16 February 1997;8 (iv) the claims are time-barred under the principles of acquiescence and extinctive prescription;9 and (v) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant's claim for moral damages.10 In any event, the Respondent denies that it breached any obligation under the Treaty.11\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 53.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 33-36; 426-444; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 3-21, 287-302.\n\n7 Statement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 31-37; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 37; 466-476; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 24 (where, unlike in the Statement of Defense and the Counter-Memorial, the Respondent treats the alleged illegality of the investment and bad faith as issues of admissibility and not of jurisdiction), 328-330\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 40.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 36; 452-465; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 309-327.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 18; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 35, Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 303-308.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 44.\n\n**II.

The Tribunal invited the Parties to formally confirm their availability for the new proposed hearing dates.\n\n109.\n\nOn 15 October 2021, the Respondent (i) confirmed its availability for the new hearing dates and (ii) requested leave to submit its brief observations on the Claimant's 1 October 2021 Submission for 15 days as of the Tribunal's decision on its request on the ground that the Claimant's Submission contained new allegations and evidence.\n\n110.\n\nAlso on 15 October 2021, the Claimant confirmed its availability for the new hearing dates. However, noting that its quantum expert would not be available to testify on his expert report after 25 January 2022 for a three-week period, the Claimant requested that the quantum experts be examined on 25 January 2022. As to the Respondent's request for leave, the Claimant rejected the Respondent's claim that its 1 October 2021 Submission contained new allegations and, therefore, did not consider a further submission by the Respondent was warranted. Notwithstanding, should the Tribunal decide to grant the Respondent a further submission, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal strictly limit the Respondent's submission to addressing two new exhibits and, in turn, grant the Claimant the opportunity to file a sur-reply.\n\n111.\n\nOn 19 October 2021, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would take place from 24 to 28 January 2022, with 29 January 2022 held in reserve, and that quantum experts would be examined after the Parties' opening statements on 25 January 2022, as requested by the Claimant.\n\n112.\n\nIn the same letter, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to submit, by 3 November 2021, brief observations on the Claimant's 1 October 2021 Submission, which was to be strictly responsive to the new allegations and arguments made therein.

In its Submission, the Respondent took issue with the Claimant's observations in the 1 October 2021 Submission, noting that most of them were responsive to the Counter-Memorial, not the Rejoinder, and as a result should be disregarded by the Tribunal.\n\n114.\n\nAlso on the same date, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of the change in its counsel team due to Ms. Mailis Meier-Lutterodt's departure from Ellex Raidla.\n\n115.\n\nOn 1 December 2021, the Claimant submitted its response to the Respondent's 3 November 2021 Submission (the \"**1 December 2021 Submission**\"), along with exhibits C-599 to C-603.\n\n116.\n\nBy e-mail dated 23 December 2021, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that, in light of the Respondent's explanations provided in its 1 December 2021 Submission regarding its failure to provide Mr. Molina the share certificates of Corona Resources, it no longer saw any need to cross-examine Mr. Molina in the hearing and thus would release Mr. Molina as a witness.\n\n117.\n\nOn 10 January 2022, having regard to the Parties' correspondence of 11 August 2021 and the Claimant's correspondence of 15 October 2021 and 23 December 2021, the Tribunal circulated an indicative hearing schedule and invited the Parties' comments.\n\n118.\n\nOn 14 January 2022, the Parties respectively submitted their comments on the indicative hearing schedule.\n\n119.\n\nOn 19 January 2022, the Claimant requested to introduce into the record a document regarding the Claimant's revised calculation of the \"Beta factors\" as exhibit C-604.\n\n120.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimant's request of 19 January 2022 and issued a revised schedule for the hearing.\n\n121.\n\nOn 20 January 2022, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's request of 19 January 2022 to introduce a new document into the record.\n\n122.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that, based on exhibit C-604, it would be prepared to submit a revised Beta calculation, to be identified as exhibit C-605. The Claimant enclosed the document in its e-mail correspondence the next day.\n\n123.\n\nOn 22 January 2022, the Tribunal rejected the Claimant's requests to admit exhibits C-604 and C-605 to the record, determining that the current circumstances did not warrant an exception to consider new evidence in accordance with section 6.4 of Procedural Order No. 1.

Concerning the format of submissions, the Parties agreed that \"*any fees and expenditures related to pre-arbitral costs, ancillary court proceedings, and any contingency/success fee arrangements with counsel and/or third-party funders, if applicable, will be filed separately under this heading*,\" subject to the proviso that \"*the Respondent does not accept that* [such] *costs* [could] *be claimed in these proceedings*\". The Parties agreed to file supporting invoices for costs over a threshold of USD 8,000. The Parties proposed deadlines of 30 April 2024 for the first round of costs submissions and 14 May 2024 for responsive rounds.\n\n136.\n\nIn its e-mail of 17 April 2024, the Respondent conveyed the Parties' request that the Tribunal decide on matters not agreed, namely (i) the page limit for the detailed argumentation on costs, (ii) information regarding fees paid versus fees accrued, and (iii) the currency for legal costs. The Respondent's request was for a page limit of two pages; for costs submissions to set out the amount of legal fees paid versus the legal fees that are deemed to have accrued but or not yet paid; and for legal costs to be claimed in the currency in which they were incurred. The Claimant's request was for no page limit or requirement to differentiate between fees paid and fees accrued, and for all amounts to be expressed in US dollars.

The Tribunal further proposed to remain constituted following the issuance of the award to decide any disagreement between the Parties in relation to the designation of any information contained in the award as confidential or protected information and redactions to be made to the award prior to its publication on the PCA's website. Finally, the Tribunal proposed to apply the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration as guidance when considering matters regarding the designation of confidential or protected information.\n\n141.\n\nBy e-mail of 7 February 2025, the Claimant, *inter alia,* consented to \"the Tribunal applying the operative redaction categories in Article 7(2) of the [UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-State Arbitration] as guiding foundational principles, supplemented by additional factors necessary to protect [Personal Privacy Information].\" Accordingly, it requested that the Tribunal \"consider redactions of [Personal Privacy Information] alongside the criteria in Article 7(2) to safeguard the panoply of legitimate privacy and confidentiality interests.\"\n\n142.\n\nBy e-mail of 10 February 2025, the Respondent confirmed its agreement to the Claimant's proposal outlined in the paragraph 141 above.\n\n**III.

While the formal address of the Seaplane Harbor land plot was K\u00fcti 17, the Respondent states that K\u00fcti 17a was also used to designate a part of the land plot, though no such address existed legally. *See* Counter-Memorial, fn. 8.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 377-378. *See* Heritage Conservation Act, 9 March 1994 (**RLA-082**); Area map of cultural monuments Nos. 3115 and 2628 and their buffer zones, 20 February 2020 (**R-107**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 378. *See* UNESCO Cultural Heritage List Documentation for file No. 822 \u2013 Historical Center of Tallinn, 25 February 2020 (**R-108**).\n\n*See, e.g.*, Heritage Conservation Act, 9 March 1994 (**RLA-082**); Government of Estonia, Regulation No. 278, \"Establishing the border and the buffer zone border for the Old Town of Tallinn\", RT I 1999, 72, 692, 28 September 1999 (**RLA-083**); Government of Estonia, Regulation No. 155, \"Statute of the Heritage Conservation Area of the Old Town of Tallinn, RT I 2003, 44, 303, 20 May 2003 (**RLA-084**); R.

It was taken over by the Red Army of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (the \"**Soviet Union**\" or the \"**USSR**\") on 21-22 June 1940.35 After the occupation of Estonia by the German military between 1941 and 1944, which also made use of the Seaplane Harbor, the Soviet armed forces re-established their control over Estonia in the fall of 1944 and regained possession of the Seaplane Harbor.36\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 17; Statement of Defense, \u00b6 4.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 59; 'Timeline of the Seaplane Harbor/Seaplane Hangar' in *Tallinn's Seaplane Hangar: From Plane Shed to Museum*, 2015, p. 30 (**C-011**); Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 7.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 59; 'Timeline of the Seaplane Harbor/Seaplane Hangar' in *Tallinn's Seaplane Hangar: From Plane Shed to Museum*, 2015, pp. 30-31 (**C-011**).\n\n155.\n\nThe below map shows the Seaplane Harbor area in 1946 separated into five distinct areas.37 While the entire area was seized by the Soviet military, the areas relevant to this arbitration are areas [1], which houses the lumber facilities, and [3], where the Seaplane Hangar and the berths in dispute are located.38 Areas [3] and [4] were designated as Military Camp No. 22 by the Soviet military.39\n\nMap of the Noblessner Shipyard and the Seaplane Harbor area in 1946 (**R-019**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 67-75.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 76.\n\n156.\n\nThe following map provides a simplified layout of the disputed area (areas colored only in green and blue) at the time of the Claimant's alleged investment:40\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 5, Figure 1.

Legal Instruments Adopted in the Transition Period**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The March 1990 Resolution and Prior Developments**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s, several movements on the \"new national awakening\" of Estonia emerged, where, by 1988, there was constant public discussion and protests in regard to ending the Soviet occupation and restoring Estonia's independence.53 The demands for independence led to the decision of the Supreme Council of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (the \"**Supreme Council of the ESSR**\" or the \"**Supreme Council**\") on 12 November 1989 to rule that the vote to join the USSR in July 1940 after Estonia's full military occupation had been illegal.54 In February 1990, the Congress of Estonia\u2014an \"unofficial parliament\"\u2014was elected by more than 500.000 citizens of the pre-WW II Republic of Estonia and their descendants.55 On 11 March 1990, the Congress of Estonia declared that \"[o]n 17 June 1940, the USSR started the aggression against the Republic of Estonia\", which is \"a country occupied and annexed by the USSR until today\".56\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 237-238; David J.

The elections were open to all residents of the ESSR, including the Russian-speaking population that had arrived after 1940.57 On 29 March 1990, the Supreme Council adopted a resolution in which it declared the restoration of the Republic of Estonia pursuant to the principle of *restitutio ad integrum*, meaning that Estonia had been under Soviet occupation since 1940 but never ceased to be a *de jure* independent State (the \"**March 1990 Resolution**\").58 Furthermore, the March 1990 Resolution \"recognize[d] the illegitimacy of the state power of the USSR in Estonia from the date of its establishment\" and \"proclaime[d] a transitional period\".59\n\nDavid J.

To suspend temporarily, until the adoption of Estonian legislative acts regulating the privatization of the property, all transactions with the statutory fund property of state-owned enterprises and other organisations, which cause a change in the ownership of such property, except in the cases provided in section 3.2. of this resolution and also the transfer of property from state farms to collective farms following the established procedure.61\n\nResolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia regarding the Initial Measures for Organising the Privatization Process, 17 July 1990 (**CLA-195**).\n\nResolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia regarding the Initial Measures for Organising the Privatization Process, 17 July 1990 (**CLA-195**).\n\n166.\n\nOn 19 December 1990, the resolution on the Restoration of Continuity of Right of Ownership (the \"**19 December 1990 Resolution**\") was adopted by the Supreme Council based on, *inter alia*, the March 1990 Resolution. The 19 December 1990 Resolution, *inter alia*, set out that the Government of the Estonian Republic shall prepare a list of previous owners and their successors whose property was nationalized by the Soviet Union since 1940 so that the property could be returned, or compensation be paid, in conformity with the Estonian legal order.62\n\n19 December 1990 Resolution (**CLA-196**).\n\n167.\n\nOn 20 August 1991, the Supreme Council of Estonia affirmed (and officially declared) Estonia's full independence from the USSR based on the continuity of the 1918 Republic as a subject of international law.63\n\nDavid J.

To stop transactions made by USSR Defense Ministry without agreement from ER State Government with buildings, structures and other property assets located on ER territory until the corresponding decision is made by ER Supreme Council.\n\n2. [To] [e]stablish that all transactions made before enactment of the current Ruling by USSR Defense Ministry or by its dependent legal entities with landholdings, buildings and other property assets located on ER territory have to be registered with the correspondent county or city administration within one month from enactment of the current Ruling.68\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 191; Regulation No. 244 (**CLA-197**).\n\nRegulation No. 244 (**CLA-197**).\n\n**3. The 23 January 1992 Resolution**\n-------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nOn 23 January 1992, the Supreme Council passed a resolution by which buildings, structures, and other assets possessed by the former USSR armed forces were declared the property of Estonia (the \"**23 January 1992 Resolution**\" or \"**1992 Supreme Council Resolution**\") and any transactions with these assets were prohibited69:\n\n1. To declare buildings, structures, military weapons, military hardware, supplies and other assets possessed by former USSR military forces units located on ER territory to become the property of the Estonian Republic.\n\n2. The ER State Government has to determine composition of the assets possessed by former USSR military forces units located on ER territory and has to solve administrative and technical problems of taking over assets by collaborating with appropriate agencies of the legal successor of USSR, also has to arrange the administration, usage and control over these assets.\n\n3. Prohibit all transactions with land, buildings, structures, military weapons, military hardware, supplies and other assets located on ER territory and belonging to the former USSR military units without permission from the ER State Government.70\n\n*See*, e.g., Reply, \u00b6 1244.\n\n23 January 1992 Resolution (**C-197**).\n\n**4. The 24 July 1992 Regulation**\n----------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nA resolution of 24 July 1992 required that past real estate transactions with the Soviet armed forces must be \"re-registered\" with the Ministry of Defense of Estonia and forbid any further transactions with such assets acquired from the Soviet armed forces (\"**Regulation No. 215**\" or \"**24 July 1992 Regulation**\"):\n\n1. Transactions concluded between former units of USSR armed forces and any enterprise, establishment, organization or private person regarding the land, buildings and structures on the territory of the Republic of Estonia that are in accordance with the law, must be re-registered in the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Estonia by August 15, 1992. The Ministry of Defense has to take into account the standpoint of the government committee formed for the supervision of the legality of these transactions when re-registering the transactions.\n\n2. To forbid any further transactions of the enterprises, establishments, organizations and private people of the Republic of Estonia with the land, buildings and structures on the Republic of Estonia acquired from the units of the former USSR armed forces.71\n\n24 July 1992 Regulation (**C-198**).\n\n172.\n\nWith respect to the phrase \"that are in accordance with the law\" expressed in section 1 of 24 July 1992 Regulation,72 the Claimant submits that it applies to transactions that were submitted for re-registration and were found to be legal and concluded in good faith by the government committee referenced in the same section.73 The Claimant takes the view that Resolution No. 215 only established an obligation for re-registration in the Ministry of Defense and did not extend an existing registration deadline.74\n\n*See* Tribunal Questions, Question 10.\n\nClaimant's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6\u00b6 136-138, 141.\n\nClaimant's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6 142.\n\n173.\n\nFor the Respondent, the particular meaning of the phrase is not known as it has not been disclosed in the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*.75 But it notes that Regulation No. 244 had already imposed the duty to register previously concluded transactions and to request permission from the Government Office for any future transactions. According to Regulation No. 244, upon failure to comply with these duties, those transactions which had not been registered or which had taken place without permission from the relevant administration might be deemed not to be in accordance with the law.76\n\nRespondent's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6 30.\n\nRespondent's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6 34.\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the focus of section 1 of Resolution No. 215 is on the second paragraph, which \"refers to the fact that the legality of any transaction was to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Ministry of Defense.\"77 The Respondent asserts that all transactions concluded with the Soviet military, including those made in good faith, were subject to the re- registration requirement, which could then be validated by the Ministry of Defense upon a case-by-case review.78\n\nRespondent's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n\nRespondent's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\n175.\n\nAfter restoring its independence, Estonia also amended or annulled certain parts of the Civil Code of the ESSR.79 The provisions of the Civil Code regarding the validity of transactions were never retroactively annulled by Estonia, but were left in force by Estonia until 1 September 1994 when the all-new General Part of the Civil Code Act entered into force.80\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 198.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 198; Overview of the Annulments of the Civil Code (**RLA-050**).\n\n**D. The Alleged Chain of Title of the Buildings in the Seaplane Harbor**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the transfer of title to the buildings in the Seaplane Harbor after the Soviet occupation and before the Claimant allegedly acquired rights thereto.\n\n177.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Soviet military sold the buildings and structures at the Seaplane Harbor to private entities before the Soviet occupation ended in Estonia, as the Seaplane Harbor was no longer viewed to be a vital asset.81 The Respondent disagrees, arguing that the Claimant's alleged predecessors never acquired any rights to the assets they were using.82 Instead, the Respondent contends that the assets at issue were officially transferred by the Soviet military to Estonia, rejecting the claim that the titles were passed down to the private entities.83\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 64.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 92.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 14.\n\n**1. The Claimant's Position: Transactions from the Soviet Military to Private Entities**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Sale Transactions to B&E**\n-------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nOn 29 December 1989, the construction committee of the ESSR adopted Decree No. 477 to establish the small state enterprise SEK, whose founding members were: (i) Military Factory No. 84; (ii) another small state enterprise called Sevek; (iii) a company called Elektron; and (iv) the Construction Directorate of the Soviet Baltic Fleet (\"**BFC**\").84 Decree No. 477 established SEK as a separate legal entity with its own balance sheet, recorded its address at K\u00fcti 17, Tallinn, and assigned Mr. Vladimir Truhan as the director.85\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 67; ESSR Construction Committee, Decree No. 477 of the Soviet Civil Construction Authority on Establishing SEK, 29 December 1989 (**R-032** (English translation) / **C-018** (original language)).\n\nESSR Construction Committee, Decree No. 477 of the Soviet Civil Construction Authority on Establishing SEK, 29 December 1989, \u00a7 1 (**R-032** (English translation) / **C-018** (original language)). *See also* Articles of Association of SEK, 29 December 1989, \u00a7\u00a7 1.4, 1.5.2 (**R-033**).\n\n179.\n\nWhile SEK was directed to carry out a number of economic activities related to timber production, it was to \"prioritis[e] the fulfilment of public procurements for [Military Factory No. 84] under its operative management\".86 The assets and funds of SEK were to be composed by the contributions of the founders, whereas the resources for SEK's activities were to be provided by Military Factory No. 84 with the volumes mandated by the state procurement plan.87\n\nArticles of Association of SEK, 29 December 1989, \u00a7\u00a7 1.7.1, 3.1 (**R-033**).\n\nArticles of Association of SEK, 29 December 1989, \u00a7\u00a7 2.1, 4.1 (**R-033**).\n\n180.\n\nOn 22 May 1990, Military Factory No. 84 and BFC entered into an agreement with O\u00dc B&E (\"**B&E**\"), a joint enterprise between a German company called Bauman Import-Eksport and Elektron, to sell all of SEK's assets at the Seaplane Harbor for RUB 7.3 million (\"**Contract No. 16**\").88\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 68; Claimant's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6 88; Contract No. 16 (**C-023** / **R-036**). The appendix, which lists the transferred assets, has not been submitted by the Claimant.\n\n181.\n\nOn 5 June 1990, the parties to Contract No. 16 signed a protocol of transfer and acceptance, which included a list of 30 buildings and inventory at the lumber works site sold to B&E.89 According to the Claimant, these transfers were recognized by the Tallinn Circuit Court in 2002.90\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 108;

and (ii) B&E to assume all the rights and obligations of SEK and become the \"legal successor of SEK.\"91 On the same day, Mr. Truhan issued another Directive No. 17/90 in which he ordered to take 22 buildings and structures \"to the balance sheet of small enterprise SEK\" and transfer these buildings to B&E in accordance with the co-founders' \"approval\" (or \"consent\").92\n\nSEK Directive No. 17/90 (**C-019**).\n\nWhile the Claimant translated the word to \"pursuant to the approval,\" the Respondent's translation provides a different wording, \"based on the consent.\" *Compare* SEK Directive No. 17/90 (**C-024**) *with* Respondent's Translation of Claimant's Exhibit C-024 (**R-035**).\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Soviet military relinquished its interest in the buildings at the Seaplane Harbor, in part, when Military Factory No. 84 agreed to transfer the assets to B&E under Contract No. 16.93 The transfer of assets, the Claimant continues, was finalized on 1 November 1990 when SEK Directive No. 17/90 was issued.94 According to the Claimant, SEK's board approved the sale, and B&E's subsequent ownership of SEK's Port facilities was registered in the Tallinn Registry of Buildings.95\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 68, 253, *referring to* Contract No. 16 (**C-023 / R-036**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 68, *referring to* SEK Directive No. 17/90 (**C-019**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 253-254, *referring to* Tallinn Building Registry Certificate No. 8395 issued to B&E, 27 October 1995 (**C-033**).\n\n184.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, B&E owned and operated the assets until it sold them to Agrin on 26 September 1997.96\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 72; Contract of Purchase and Sales and Pledge Contract between Agrin and B&E, 26 September 1997 (**C-020**).\n\n185.\n\nTo the contrary, the Respondent posits that Contract No. 16 \"cannot exist in the same physical universe [with SEK Directive No. 17/90]\" because they support two \"mutually exclusive [\u2026] theories\" concerning the purported transfer of assets to B&E, as shown below: (i) B&E obtained title from SEK pursuant to SEK Directive No. 17/90 after SEK took over all assets of Military Factory No. 84, or (ii) from Military Factory No. 84 and BFC *via* Contract No. 16:97\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98, 110. *See* Counter-Memorial, Figure 9. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 107:17-24.\n\n186.\n\nAddressing the first theory involving the alleged transfer from SEK, the Respondent contends that no document exists to indicate that SEK ever obtained title to any property on the lumber works site or replaced Military Factory No. 84 to be able to transfer them to others.98 In this respect, the Respondent points out that a resolution of the Housing Commission for Tallinn dated 19 June 1990 shows Military Factory No. 84's ownership of the buildings at K\u00fcti 17 as of that date.99\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 101-102;

(ii) the document only vaguely makes reference to \"consent\" by the co-founders of SEK and of B&E, without providing any details;100 (iii) it purports to transfer the Seaplane Hangar and Berth Nos. 38 and 38A, which were never owned by Military Factory No. 84; and (iv) the remaining listed assets are inconsistent with other contemporaneous documents covering the area, which list 30 different buildings, rather than 22.101\n\nWhile the Claimant translated the word to \"pursuant to the approval,\" the Respondent's translation provides a different wording, \"based on the consent.\" *Compare* SEK Directive No. 17/90 (**C-024**) *with* Respondent's Translation of Claimant's Exhibit C-024 (**R-035**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 103, *referring to* Respondent's Translation of Claimant's Exhibit C-024 (**R-035**);

(ii) the assets that were purportedly transferred to B&E were limited to lumber work buildings, excluding the Seaplane Hangar and the berths; and (iii) some of the assets listed in the 5 June 1990 protocol in fact no longer existed at the time of the purported transfer.102 As such, \"[i]f the buildings on the lumber working site were already sold to B&E on 22 May 1990, they could not have been transferred to SEK on 1 November 1990, and, on the same day, again to B&E.\"103 Such inconsistency, in the Respondent's view, \"further undermines the already non-existent credibility of the Directive.\"104\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 107-109, *referring to* Contract No. 16 (**C-023 / R-036**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 110.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 105.\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondent notes that, in any event, there is another version of Contract No. 16 with key differences, such as naming Military Factory No. 84 as the only seller and containing a different map and a different list of assets in the appendix, which includes the Seaplane Hangar and berths Nos. 38 and 38A.105 This second version of Contract No. 16, according to the Respondent, was submitted by B&E in the Estonian court proceedings, \"apparently forgetting that it had previously submitted a different version (the one that the Claimant now relies on) to the Building Register.\"106 In fact, B&E, the Respondent continues, admitted during the Estonian proceedings that \"it [had] not acquired assets on the basis of [Contract No. 16]\" and that Contract No. 16 was indeed a forgery.107 The Respondent adds that the bank account listed in the first version of Contract No. 16 also points to forgery as it was not opened until 26 June 1990, a month after the alleged date of the contract.108\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 113, *referring to* Second version of Contract No. 16 (**R-038**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 113.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 116-117, *citing* March 2006 Appeal Judgment (**C-081**). *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 97:2-9.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 114, *referring to* Contract No. 16 (**C-023 / R-036**);

The Respondent's Position: Transfer of Assets by the USSR to Estonia**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the sales transactions between the Soviet Military and private parties alleged by the Claimant ever took place. It posits that Contract No. 16 and SEK Directive No. 17/90, both adduced by the Claimant in support of its claims, cannot coexist.134 It also disputes the two mutually exclusive theories arising from either Contract No. 16 or SEK Directive No. 17/90 being the means through which title was passed on to B&E. First, it argues that SEK Directive No. 17/90 could not transfer title to B&E because SEK's ownership of the assets was not substantiated, because it could not order a transfer from an unnamed company to its own balance sheet, and because the information contained therein is inconsistent with the assets of Military Factory 84.135 Secondly, it argues that there are inconsistencies surrounding Contract No. 16, including the second version of the same contract which was filed by the Claimant in the domestic proceedings, which point to its forgery.136 The Respondent finally contends that all documents concerning B&E's transactions were forged.137\n\n*See* \u00b6 185 above.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 186-187 above.

It argues that many documents on which the Claimant rests its allegations are missing or never existed, while others exist in multiple versions which are inconsistent and contradictory. The involvement of the same people throughout the transactions chain, especially of Mr. Sukortsev, commander of military unit 1176 and later Verest's majority shareholder, would suggest a profit motive behind the attempted sale of public property. According to the Respondent, these elements together point again to forgery.138 The Respondent finally notes that, in any case, the alleged transactions would have been \"illegal and impossible in the Soviet legal system.\"139\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 118-132, 205-206; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 72-76.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 76.\n\n205.\n\nTherefore, according to the Respondent, the title of the disputed buildings never passed to the Claimant's alleged predecessors.140 Rather, the Soviet military handed over the real estate to Estonia.141 On 26 July 1994, a treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonian territory and on the conditions of their temporary stay in Estonia was signed between Estonia and Russia.142 With respect to the various assets located on the Seaplane Harbor, the handover of berths Nos. 36, 36A and 37 were completed by 29 July 1994, whereas the handover of Military Camp No. 22, which included the Seaplane Hangar, was completed by 30 July 1994.143 The Russian troops completed its withdrawal from Estonia on 31 August 1994.144\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 92-94.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 133-139.\n\nExtract of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, 25 Years since the Withdrawal of Russian Troops from Estonia, 31 August 2019 (**R-054**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 134-135, *referring to* Handover Protocol of Military Camp 22, 15/20 February 1994 (**R-055**); Handover Protocol of berths Nos. 36, 36A, 37, 15 March 1994 (**R-028**). *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 115:6-12.\n\nExtract of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, 25 Years since the Withdrawal of Russian Troops from Estonia, 31 August 2019 (**R-054**).

Mayorov, on behalf of BFC, sent a letter to the Estonian Ministry of Defense, offering to hand over Military Camp No. 158, *i.e.*, the lumber works site.145 The undated handover protocol concerning Military Camp No. 158 attached to the letter was signed by the representatives from Estonia's Ministry of Defense and by the chief of 328 military station and the members of the commission from the Russian side.146 However, on 19 January 1995, Mr. Mayorov sent another letter to the Estonian Ministry of Defense, requesting to consider the letter of 19 September 1994 void because it \"contain[ed] a mistake due to a fault by its author.\"147 In the letter, Mr. Mayorov clarified that (i) BFC did not own Military Camp No. 158 and (ii) the lumber working section of Military Factory No. 84, which was located at the same address, had been sold to B&E pursuant to Contract No. 16.148\n\nBFC Letter regarding Handover Protocols Handing Over Military Camp No. 158, 19 September 1994 (**R-057**).

Lease Agreements with Verest and Agrin**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nThe Claimant states that in 1996, after being informed that the owners of the Lennusadam Port were looking to sell the port, Mr. Rotko was introduced to Mr. Dimitri Sukortsev, the owner of Verest, and Mr. Enn Laansoo, the owner of Agrin, respectively, by Mr. Aleksandr Mele\u0161ko, a port dispatcher at the Old City Harbor (Vanasadam Port).153 Given that BPV was using other ports in Estonia for its trading activities, Mr. Rotko considered that acquiring its own port would allow BPV, and correspondingly ELA, \"to expand and vertically integrate [their] commercial operations with guaranteed port facility access.\"154\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 81-82; Second Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21-22 (**CWS-2**).\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6 18 (**CWS-2**). *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 81; Second Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20 (**CWS-2**).\n\n210.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, BPV\u2014 after conducting due diligence\u2014entered into separate lease agreements with Verest and Agrin on 1 October 1997 to lease the buildings at the Seaplane Harbor owned by the two companies.155 The lease with Verest covered the use of berths Nos. 38, 38A and the Seaplane Hangar, all of which were located in K\u00fcti 17, Tallinn.156 The lease with Agrin included the following buildings at the Seaplane Harbor on the K\u00fcti 17a premises: gate building, administrative building, machine building, carpentry factory, dryer, sorting factory, sawmill unit, residue warehouse, firewood warehouse, heating fuel warehouse, carpentry factory, fire alarm station, boiler plant, car garage, assembly factory, produce warehouse, and shelter (warehouse).157\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84; Second Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25 (**CWS-2**); Lease Agreement between BPV and Verest, 1 October 1997 (**C-046**); Lease Agreement between BPV and Agrin, 1 October 1997 (**C-047**).\n\nLease Agreement between BPV and Verest, 1 October 1997, \u00a7 1.1 (**C-046**).\n\nLease Agreement between BPV and Agrin, 1 October 1997, \u00a7 1.1 (**C-047**).\n\n211.\n\nThe remaining terms of both lease agreements were identical. They stipulated *inter alia* that (i) BPV was \"the owner of the buildings\"; (ii) BPV would pay EEK 60,000 per year; (iii) BPV would \"invest into the buildings and land for the processing of wood and development of the port up to [USD] 5,000,000 until 1 January 2001\"; and (iv) the leases would continue for 20 years, expiring on 1 October 2017.158 In addition, both lease agreements provided BPV \"a grace period for the payment of rent until 1 January 2001,\" so long as it made the requisite USD 5 million investment to the covered buildings and structures.159\n\nLease Agreement between BPV and Verest, 1 October 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 1.3, 3.1, 7.1, 8.1 (**C-046**); Lease Agreement between BPV and Agrin, 1 October 1997, \u00a7\u00a7 1.3, 3.1, 7.1, 8.1 (**C-047**).\n\nLease Agreement between BPV and Verest, 1 October 1997, \u00a7 7.2 (**C-046**); Lease Agreement between BPV and Agrin, 1 October 1997, \u00a7 7.2 (**C-047**).\n\n212.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the authenticity of the lease agreements, stating that they did not surface until 2005 and were obviously backdated.160 According to the Respondent, there is no evidence on file but for Mr. Rotko's witness testimony that the Claimant became active at the Seaplane Harbor before 1999.161\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 140-147.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 10.\n\n213.\n\nOn 14 November 1997, six weeks after BPV had allegedly concluded the lease agreements with Verest and Agrin, Estonia brought a lawsuit in Tallinn City Court, claiming that it was the rightful owner of the buildings and structures at K\u00fcti 17 and 17a.162 In the lawsuit, Estonia sought not only a declaration that it was the rightful owner of the buildings located on K\u00fcti 17 and 17a, but also an injunction barring their transfer and encumbrance.163\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6 26 (**CWS-2**); August 2000 Judgment, Statement of Claim, 14 November 1997 (**C-050**). *See* below paragraph 284.\n\nAugust 2000 Judgment, Statement of Claim, 14 November 1997, p. 6 (**C-050**).\n\n214.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, this lawsuit was the first time that Mr. Rotko or any other officers of ELA and BPV knew that the ownership of the Seaplane Harbor might be in dispute.164 However, the Claimant considered that it \"had no reason to believe that those leases were affected in any way by Estonia's ownership claim,\" given that BPV had signed the leases over a month before the claim had been brought.165\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 105; Second Rotko Statement, \u00b6 26 (**CWS-2**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 109.\n\n215.\n\nThe Claimant states that, in accordance with the contractual obligations under the lease agreements, ELA made a total investment of approximately USD 9.1 million, spending USD 7 million in Port improvements and another USD 2.19 million in the lumber facilities.166\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 110; Deloitte Valuation Report, 29 August 2019, pp. 55-56 (**CER-5**).\n\n**2. BPV's Acquisition of Verest and Agrin**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nThe Claimant states that when it first took possession of the Port, it observed that the Lennusadam Port required \"significant harbor dredging and capital improvements throughout the facilities\" in order to reach the Port's optimal efficiency and use.167 Therefore, before making the necessary expenditures to refurbish the Port, Mr. Rotko \"wanted to determine if [he] could obtain ownership of the Port from Verest and Agrin\" since he was aware of the risk that Verest might lose its possession of the Port due to its financial instability.168\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 27-31 (**CWS-2**).\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32 (**CWS-2**).\n\n217.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, after consulting with Estonian lawyers about the pending lawsuit against Verest and Agrin brought by the Estonian Government, Mr. Rotko and other corporate officers concluded that the lawsuit \"was nothing more than a nuisance complaint\" lacking merit.169 They also relied on a letter written by the Minister of Economy, Mr. Jaak Leimann, the day before the lawsuit was filed, confirming that the process by which the USSR created SEK in 1989 was legitimate and that SEK could be reorganized and liquidated by its board of directors without approval by the Ministry.170\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6 33 (**CWS-2**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 113, *referring to* Letter from Jaak Leimann, Minister of Economy, to Tiina Mitt, Armit Law Office, 13 November 1997 (**C-202**).\n\n218.\n\nConsequently, on 23 September 1999, BPV purchased Verest by paying EEK 10,000 (approximately USD 667) for all of Verest's shares and agreeing to assume EEK 526,000 (approximately USD 35,063) in debts that Verest had incurred.171\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 114; Share Purchase Agreement between BPV and Verest, 23 September 1999, Articles 2.1, 5.2 (**C-055**).\n\n219.\n\nIn respect of Agrin, Mr. Rotko personally acquired the company through Ella Kaubanduse on 8 December 1999, so that Agrin would become an affiliate of Verest and together they would become part of the ELA Corporate Group.172 For the acquisition of Agrin's shares, Ella Kaubanduse paid EEK 180,000.173\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34 (**CWS-2**).\n\nShare Sale Contract between BPV and Alcedo for the sale of Agrin, 8 December 1999 (**C-057**).\n\n**3. Joint Venture Agreement**\n------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, on 21 October 1999, Verest, BPV and Agrin entered into an agreement to jointly manage, use, and modernize the Port's buildings located on K\u00fcti 17 and 17a \"with the goals to build a wood processing complex and a modern port\" (the \"**JVA**\").174 The Respondent submits that the JVA was very likely backdated. This is because the JVA states in its preamble that Agrin was represented by Mr. Jevgeni Skljarov, a member of its management board.

to* Letter from the Minister of Transport and Communications to BPV, 19 November 2002 (**C-465**).\n\n255.\n\nOn 16 October 2001, the Ministry of Transport rejected BPV's request, stating that it did \"not comply with [\u2026] the Port Act because the coordination of the city council of the local government249 is missing.\"\n\nLetter from the Minister of Transport and Communications to BPV, 16 October 2001 (**C-461**).\n\n256.\n\nOn 17 December 2001, the Claimant requested the Tallinn Sustainable Development and Planning Office (\"**Tallinn's Planning Office**\") to assign the borders of the Port basin.250\n\nLetter from Tallinn's Planning Office to BPV, 10 January 2002 (**C-462**).\n\n257.\n\nOn 10 January 2002, the Tallinn's Planning Office, informed BPV that pursuant to the Port Act its request could not be granted without a border proposal from the Minister of Transport.251\n\nLetter from Tallinn's Planning Office to BPV, 10 January 2002 (**C-462**).\n\n258.\n\nOn 9 May 2002, the Ministry of Transport advised BPV that\u2014according to a proper construction of the Port Act and the former practice of the Tallinn City Council\u2014port basin borders are assigned by the Estonian government in accordance with the Minister of Transport's proposal, but only after \"municipal council coordination\".252\n\nLetter from the Minister of Transport and Communications to BPV, 9 May 2002 (**C-463**).\n\n259.\n\nThereafter, BPV submitted to the Tallinn City Council an application to coordinate the Port basin borders, which the Council did in the form of a draft legislation.253 However, the Tallinn City Government decided not to discuss such draft because, according to the Port Act, private parties do not have the right to apply for an assignment of port basis borders, which is a public law task.254\n\nLetter from the Tallinn City Office to BPV, 11 October 2002 (**C-464**).\n\nLetter from the Tallinn City Office to BPV, 11 October 2002 (**C-464**).\n\n260.\n\nOn 4 November 2002, the Ministry of Transport reiterated that it could not propose the Port basin borders without having beforehand a municipal council coordination.255 The Ministry further reiterated that this was in line with the Port Act and previous practice of the Tallinn City Council.256\n\nLetter from the Minister of Transport and Communications to BPV, 19 November 2002 (**C-465**).\n\nLetter from the Minister of Transport and Communications to BPV, 19 November 2002 (**C-465**).\n\n261.\n\nOn 23 December 2003, BPV requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (\"**Ministry

Communications re Port Basin Border Coordination, 23 December 2002 (**C-426**).\n\n262.\n\nOn 28 January 2003, the Ministry of Economic Affairs rejected BPV's request on the basis that \"BPV [was] not the possessor of the port, therefore [it did] not have the authority to apply for Seaplane Harbor port basin.\"258 In this respect, the Ministry noted that to its knowledge \"the possessor of berths on Seaplane Harbor 'L' shaped pier and the 28-hectare property located on port territory is the state, and the possessor is Ministry of the Environment.\"259\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications to BPV, 28 January 2003 (**C-466**).\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications to BPV, 28 January 2003 (**C-466**).\n\n263.\n\nOn 24 March 2004, Verest requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to coordinate port basin border points for the Port.260 Verest asserted that BPV was the possessor of the Port pursuant to section 33(1) of the Law of Property Act.261\n\nLetter from Verest to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, 24 March 2004 (**C-467**).\n\nLetter from Verest to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, 24 March 2004 (**C-467**).\n\n264.\n\nAfter Verest asked on two additional occasions for a response to its communication of 24 March 2004,262 the Ministry of Economic Affairs advised that it had sent an inquiry to the Ministry of Justice on the subject matter of that letter.263\n\nEmail from Verest to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, 26 April 2004 (**C-473**); Letter from Verest to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, 7 May 2004 (**C-475**).\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications to Verest, 10 May 2004 (**C-405**).\n\n265.\n\nOn 15 July 2004, the Ministry of Economic Affairs informed BPV that until the conclusion of the ownership dispute before the Estonian courts regarding the ownership of the buildings and structures at the Port it was not able to assign the Port basin borders.264\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications to BPV, 15 July 2004 (**C-477**).\n\n266.\n\nAside from BPV's application for the assignment of the basin borders at the Port, Mr. Rotko explains that BPV could not obtain a new Port Passport as it was not able to provide the geographic boundary information from Riigi Kinnisvara (\"**Riigi**\"), which was one of the applicable requirements.265 The Claimant asserts that although BPV requested Riigi to provide its coordinating information from 2003 to 2005, the latter company did not provide any response.266\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 72-73 (**CWS-2**).\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 72-73

to the Tallinn Customs Inspectorate and the Seaplane Harbor Customs Control Zone an application to obtain authorization to operate the Port as a customs control zone.267\n\nBPV Application for the Customs Control Zone Coordination, 4 April 2001 (**C-265**); BPV Application for the Customs Control Zone of Seaplane Harbor, 27 April 2001 (**C-266**).\n\n268.\n\nOn 25 July 2001, a Tallinn customs inspector confirmed that the Port was \"in compliance with custom's requirements for Customs control zone opening.\"268\n\nLegal Instrument No. 31 re. Eliminating Shortcomings, 25 July 2001 (**C-267**).\n\n269.\n\nOn 13 June 2002, in response to a communication submitted by BPV, the Ministry of Finance stated that it was outside of its competence to grant an authorization to open a customs control zone.269 Such authority, the Ministry of Finance noted, was held by the respective Customs Board.270 In addition, the Ministry of Finance noted that the complications with the customs control zone at the Port were \"due to ownership issue of port waters.\"271 The Ministry added that, in its view, this issue should not prevent BPV from obtaining a customs control zone permit and that the Customs Board should consider \"issuing a temporary permit during which the ownership issue could be resolved.\"272\n\nLetter from Ministry of Finance to BPV, 13 June 2002 (**C-268**).\n\nLetter from Ministry of Finance to BPV, 13 June 2002 (**C-268**).\n\nLetter from Ministry of Finance to BPV, 13 June 2002 (**C-268**).\n\nLetter from Ministry of Finance to BPV, 13 June 2002 (**C-268**).\n\n270.\n\nOn 12 August 2002, the Estonian Customs Board informed BPV and Verest that \"[a]s the Seaplane Harbor territory is currently in state's ownership it [was] necessary to receive the approval from the representative of the state \u2013 Ministry of Justice in order to designate customs control zone.\"273\n\nLetter from Estonian Customs Board to Verest and BPV, 12 August 2002 (**C-269**).\n\n271.\n\nFollowing two communications submitted by BPV to the Ministry of Justice, on 14 August 2002 and 14 January 2004, the latter refused to coordinate a temporary customs control zone.274 The Ministry asserted that there was an ongoing civil procedure in which Estonia was claiming the ownership of the buildings at the Port and that to the best of its knowledge \"there is unlawful use of state property at the Seaplane Harbor.\"275\n\nLetter from Ministry of Justice to BPV, 23 September 2002 (**C-270**); Letter from the Ministry of Justice to BPV, 21 January 2004 (**C-271**).\n\nLetter from Ministry of Justice to BPV, 23 September 2002 (**C-270**); Letter from the Ministry of Justice to BPV, 21 January 2004 (**C-271**).\n\n272.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the loss of a customs zone resulted in operational losses of revenue for ELA Tolli, Verest, Agrin, and BPV.276 To mitigate the revenue impact, ELA sold its equipment and ELA Tolli turned to alternative income sources, such as managing crane rentals at the Port.277\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 821-822; Claimant's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6 40.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 826, 835.\n\n**H.

This subsection does not apply to money or bearer securities or to a thing acquired by public auction.\"\n\n**b) Civil Proceedings concerning the Ownership of Buildings and Structures at the Port**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. 1997-2000 Proceedings before the Tallinn City Court*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nOn 14 November 1997, Estonia filed a lawsuit against Verest and B&E in the Tallinn City Court, seeking the recognition of its alleged ownership rights over the buildings and structures at the Port287 and an order to recover such properties from the alleged unlawful possession by the defendants.288 Agrin was included amongst the defendants on 3 December 1997.289\n\nIn particular, in the address K\u00fcti 17 and 17A, Tallinn City, Estonia. *See* August 2000 Judgment, Statement of Claim, 14 November 1997, p. 1 (**C-050**).\n\nAugust 2000 Judgment (**C-068**), Statement of Claim, 14 November 1997 (**C-050**).\n\nAugust 2000 Judgment, p. 3 (**C-068**).\n\n285.\n\nOn the same date, the Tallinn City Court granted the Respondent's interim request to enjoin Verest and Agrin from transferring or otherwise encumbering the buildings and properties at the Port.290 On 21 July 2000, the Tallinn City Court granted a further interim request by the Respondent to prohibit any change in the composition of the buildings or structures and the construction of any new buildings or structures.291\n\nAugust 2000 Judgment, Decision, 3 December 1997 (**C-051**).\n\nLetter from Bailiff A. Pink to B&E, Verest and Agrin, 1 April 2004 (**C-121**).\n\n286.\n\nBy judgment of 25 August 2000, the Tallinn City Court upheld Estonia's claims against Verest, B&E and Agrin (the \"**August 2000 Judgment**\").292 The City Court found that land registry files confirmed that up to July 1940 the buildings and structures at the Port were owned by Estonia.293 The City Court considered that although in July 1940, the disputed properties were taken by force into the use of the USSR Army Forces, Estonia did not transfer the ownership of such assets.294 The City Court observed that notwithstanding that a number of new buildings had been erected after 1940, there were no records proving that the said buildings had been registered as property of the USSR.295 Further, the City Court held that a number of legal acts adopted by Estonia, including the 1992 Supreme Council Resolution, confirmed that it continued owning the buildings and structures at issue throughout the occupation period.296 The City Court noted that its decision was consistent with Article 55 of the 1907 Hague Regulations (the \"**Hague Regulations**\"), which provides that \"the occupying state cannot acquire the property of the occupied country.\"297\n\nAugust 2000 Judgment, p. 3 (**C-068**).\n\nAugust 2000 Judgment, pp. 4-5 (**C-068**).\n\nAugust 2000 Judgment, p. 5 (**C-068**).\n\nAugust 2000 Judgment, p. 5 (**C-068**).\n\nAugust 2000 Judgment, pp. 5-6 (**C-068**).\n\nAugust 2000 Judgment, p. 7 (**C-068**).\n\n*ii. Disciplinary Proceedings against Judge J\u00fcri Mesipuu*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nOn 21 November 2000, the Ministry of Justice initiated disciplinary proceedings before the Disciplinary Committee of the Estonian Supreme Court (the \"**Disciplinary Committee**\") against Judge J\u00fcri Mesipuu, the judge of the Tallinn City Court that rendered the August 2000 Judgment.298 The Ministry of Justice alleged that there had been an undue delay in the resolution of the referred local proceedings, including by failing to rule on the following day of the receipt of Estonia's motion for additional interim measures as prescribed in Estonia's Code of Civil Procedure.299\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, p. 1 (**C-122**).\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001 (**C-122**).\n\n288.\n\nBy decision of 1 February 2001, the Disciplinary Committee decided to terminate the proceedings initiated by the Ministry of Justice against Judge J\u00fcri Mesipuu.300 The Disciplinary Committee determined that the conduct of Judge Mesipuu did not constitute a disciplinary offense.301 It considered *inter alia* that \"there [was] a basis to say that the length of the proceeding was not caused by the wrongful activities of the judge but rather the activities of the parties.\"302 In addition, the Disciplinary Committee stated that the Ministry of Justice had \"derailed from the principles of objectivity and equality of the parties,\" it noted in this respect that:\n\nThe disciplinary matter ha[d] been started in a civil case in which the Ministry of Justice is a party to and by the time the disciplinary proceeding was started, a court decision in that matter had not entered into force. This situation reasonably g[a]ve a basis to think that the Ministry of Justice ha[d] tried to influence the judge with non-procedural instruments; the applying of which is made possible by the Status of the Judges Act, however, the other party of the proceeding [did] not have these possibilities.303\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, p. 4 (**C-122**).\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, p. 3 (**C-122**).\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, p. 4 (**C-122**).\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, p. 4 (**C-122**).\n\n*iii. 2000-2002 Appeal Proceedings before the Tallinn Circuit Court*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nOn 13 September 2000, Verest, Agrin, and B&E appealed the August 2000 Judgment. By judgment of 2 May 2002, the Tallinn Circuit Court (\"**May 2002 Appeal Judgment**\") annulled the August 2000 Judgment on the basis of certain procedural law violations and referred the matter back to the Tallinn City Court for a new hearing.304\n\nMay 2002 Appeal Judgment, pp. 8-9 (**C-191**).\n\n*iv. Statements by Government Officials Concerning the Proceedings against Verest, Agrin, and B&E*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nOn 26 April 2001, the Office of the President of Estonia issued an official written statement containing certain remarks regarding a visit he conducted on 5 June 2000 to the Port as well as with respect to the proceedings against Verest, Agrin, and B&E.305 The referred statement provided that:\n\n1. With the wish to establish a unified vision about the architectural development of Tallinn, the president of the Republic of Estonia visited on 5.June of the previous year with the employees of the planning office, the mayor and the county governor the coastal area of Tallinn, in order to examine the opening of the capital city to the sea. The seaplane hangar on K\u00fcti Street was visited, where building activities not coordinated with the city government took place.\n\n2. The President informed the ministers of defense, environment and auditor general about the illegal building activity on the structures belonging to the State. The President requested the illegal activity to be stopped and asked for an evaluation for what has happened.\n\n3. The Minister of the Environment Heiki Kranich stated in his 21 July 2000 response to the President, that the inspectors of the Environmental Inspectorate checked the Seaplane Harbor and found violations of the law and presented the materials to the administrative court of Tallinn for the determination of an administrative punishment.\n\n4. The Auditor General stated in its 08. August 2000 reply to the President that material and moral damages have incurred to the State because of what has happened in the Seaplane Harbor because it has shown a long-term incapability to ensure legal order. Because of the court action, it is not possible for the state to perform actual control and no legal means to ensure the preservation of the assets.\n\n5. On 25. August 2000 Tallinn City Court decided that the area of the Seaplane Harbor belongs to the state. The further proceedings regarding this area are continuing. The administrator of the assets is the Ministry of Justice.\n\n6. In yesterday's meeting with the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister assured as an explanation to the information request of the President regarding the statements in the Daily Newspaper, that the areas of the Seaplane Harbor will stay in the ownership of the state and they are not municipalized.\n\n7. The President assured once again today, that all legal questions are in the jurisdiction of the courts of Estonia, except the right and obligation of the Republic of Estonia to perform sovereign power in the Republic of Estonia. This beach with the seaplane harbor belonged to the Ministry of Defense of Estonia before the occupation and was taken forcefully for the use of the USSR Army on 22 and 23. June 1940. No new legal ties have arisen from this violence. The President awaits the performing of sovereign and executive power from the Government of RoE in this matter.\n\n8. To assure the above, the President sent letters to the Auditor General and the Minister of Justice today.306\n\nOffice of the President of Estonia, Official Notices, 26 April 2001 (**C-073**).\n\nOffice of the President of Estonia, Official Notices, 26 April 2001 (**C-073**).\n\n291.\n\nOn 5 April 2004, the Minister of Justice provided comments regarding the proceedings against Verest, Agrin and B&E in a televised interview.307 Among other matters, the Minister of Justice stated that the judge of the Tallinn City Court who was responsible for the procedural errors that led to the first judgment being quashed by the Circuit Court would be \"held responsible.\"308\n\nTranscript of Justice Minister Vaher on Actuaalne Kaamera TV Program, 5 April 2004 (**C-209**).\n\nTranscript of Justice Minister Vaher on Actuaalne Kaamera TV Program, 5 April 2004 (**C-209**).\n\n*v. 2005 Tallinn City Court Proceedings*\n----------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nOn 14 March 2005, BPV and ELA Tolli were included as defendants in the proceedings.309\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment , p. 17 (**C-078**).\n\n293.\n\nBy judgment of 4 July 2005, the Tallinn City Court (\"**July 2005 Judgment**\") (i) recognized the right of ownership of Estonia to the land of the Port and the buildings therein; (ii) determined that Agrin, Verest, B&E, and ELA Tolli were unlawfully holding the possession of the mentioned land plot and buildings, and in the case of non-voluntary transfer ordered to evict the co-possessors from the buildings (enumerated on pages 1-2 of that judgment); and (iii) determined that BPV was \"a possessor in good faith and there [was] no basis to reclaim the assets from it.\"310\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, pp. 1-2, 28 (**C-078**).\n\n294.\n\nFirst, the Tallinn City Court held that it was undisputed that Estonia held the ownership of the land.311 Relying on judgment No. III-4/A-10/94 of Estonia's Supreme Court of 21 December 1994 (\"**December 1994 Supreme Court Judgment**\"), the Tallinn City Court further found that Estonia owned the buildings and structures at the Port.312 Regarding international law, the City Court noted that the Supreme Court found in its December 1994 judgment that\u2014pursuant to Article 55 of the Hague Regulations\u2014Estonia continued to be the owner of the \"real estate\" in its territory during the occupation by the USSR.313 Thus, the City Court held that although the USSR Armed Forces were in possession of the Port during the occupation, they did not have the right to dispose of it.314 As for Estonian law, the Court referred to the following instruments:\n\n(a) The 1992 Supreme Council Resolution, by which \"the buildings and other structures in the administration of the former USSR armed forces structural units were proclaimed to be the ownership of the Republic of Estonia and all transactions with these assets were forbidden without the permission of the government; the army assets are the state assets;\"315\n\n(b) The 17 July 1990 Resolution of Estonia's Supreme Council, according to which all transactions involving State assets, including those that were in the administration of the USSR armed forces, were suspended until legislation regulating the privatization of ownership was adopted;316\n\n(c) Regulation No. 244, dated 27 November 1991, which \"suspended the transactions by the USSR Ministry of Defense with buildings, structures and other real estate on the territory of Estonia without the permission of the Republic of Estonia and required that the transactions done before the adoption of this regulation had to be registered in a month in local country and city governments;\"317\n\n(d) Regulation No. 215, dated 24 July 1992, according to which \"all the transactions previously concluded with the structural units of the USSR armed forces that complied with the legislation of Republic of Estonia had to be re-registered in the Ministry of Defense by 15 August 1992;\"318 and\n\n(e) Judgment of Estonia's Supreme Court of 1998, that determined that the transactions that were not registered pursuant to regulation No. 215 were invalid because their compliance with the legislation of the Republic of Estonia has not been checked.319\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 24 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, pp. 23-24 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 23 (**C-078**). The Supreme Court had clarified in its decision of 21 December 1994 that the \"real estate\" possessed and used by the Soviet military encompassed \"land, buildings and structures\" (December 1994 Supreme Court Judgment, p. 3 (**CLA-191**)).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, pp. 23-24 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 23 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 24 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 24 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 24 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 24 (**C-078**).\n\n295.\n\nSecondly, the City Court held that the transactions by which the USSR Armed Forces transferred the property of the buildings and structures at the Port and all the subsequent transactions disposing of the same assets were void and invalid.320 The Court considered that the respective \"acquirer[s] knew and should have known, that these assets were assets that had been in the administration of the USSR army and that the Republic of Estonia had confirmed that it is in the ownership of the Republic of Estonia and that all transactions were suspended with these assets.\"321 The Court added that, in any event, the acquisition through good faith is impossible under Estonian law if the assets were taken from the owner against its will, as set out under section 156(1) of the Civil Code and section 95(3) of the Law of Property Act. Given that the buildings and structures at the port were brought to the use of the Soviet military through the annexation of Estonia and its incorporation into the Soviet Union, Estonia lost possession of the relevant assets against its will, which is why private parties could not acquire the relevant assets even if they were good faith.322 The Court concluded that Verest, Agrin, and B&E did not acquire their alleged rights over the buildings and structures at the Port, and thus, their possession over such assets lacked of legal basis.323\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 25-26, \u00b6 4 (regarding Verest) and \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11 (regarding B&E) (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 25 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 27, para. 15 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 27 (**C-078**).\n\n296.\n\nThird, in respect of the claims against BPV the City Court found that:\n\n[T]he bad faith of [BPV] was not persuasively proved. The assets in the use of this respondent cannot be viewed in the light of the 24. July 1992 regulation no.215 because according to its knowledge the assets belonging to legal persons governed by private law were given to its use. It is not reasonable to presume that in the years 1997 and 1999 when 7 years had already passed from the restoration of the Republic of Estonia, the lessee would have had to research the history of the assets that were the object of the contract [\u2026] The plaintiff did not present other basis for voidance or bad faith. Therefore, [BPV] is a possessor in good faith and there is no basis to reclaim the assets from it and therefore, the claim against [BPV] has to be left unsatisfied.324\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 28 (**C-078**).\n\n*vi. 2005 Appeal Proceedings*\n-----------------------------\n\n297.\n\nOn 22 July 2005, BPV appealed the July 2005 Judgment to the Tallinn Circuit Court.325 Verest, Agrin and ELA Tolli also filed a separate appeal to that decision on 25 July 2005.326 Estonia also appealed the July 2005 Judgment in respect of the finding concerning BPV.327\n\nPetition for Appeal of BPV, 22 July 2005 (**C-021**).\n\nPetition for Appeal of Agrin, Verest and ELA Tolli, 25 July 2005 (**C-043**).\n\nMarch 2006 Appeal Judgment, p. 27 (**C-081**).\n\n298.\n\nBy judgment of 1 March 2006, the Tallinn Circuit Court (\"**March 2006 Appeal Judgment**\") (i) annulled the portion of the July 2005 Judgment which concerned the dismissal of Estonia's claim with respect to BPV; (ii) recognized Estonia's ownership rights over all of the buildings and structures at the Port; (iii) determined that BPV was unlawfully possessing such assets; and (iv) upheld the rest of the July 2005 Judgment.328\n\nMarch 2006 Appeal Judgment (**C-081**).\n\n299.\n\nIn respect of BPV's rights under the Lease Agreements, the Tallinn Circuit Court concluded that such agreements did not provide a sufficient legal basis for BPV to retain the possession of any buildings or structures at the Port.329 In reaching this conclusion, the Circuit Court considered that it was irrelevant whether BPV was a possessor in good faith or not.330 Specifically, the Circuit Court held that:\n\nEven a valid agreement under the law of obligation[s], signed with some other person who is not related to the plaintiff as the owner of the property, would alone not be enough to retain the possession because it entails no obligations to the plaintiff. According to the judgment of the City Court, AS BPV as the defendant retains the possession of the above stated construction works without any legal grounds whatsoever. Pursuant to section 34 of the Law of Property Act, possession is lawful if it is based on legal grounds. Possession is not just a fact, but instead is a certain legally regulated relation of the person to the property, a legal relation. On the other hand, possession cannot be considered a right because it is not a property right or a right under the law of obligations or a burdening of the property; also, it cannot be entered into the Land Registry. The owner has the right of claim against anyone possessing the owner's property without legal grounds. The opinion of the plaintiff that possession in good faith or in bad faith can have any meaning only in issues related to recovery of the possession to the owner \u2013 for example, whether and in what scope the owner could have any damage compensation or other compensation claims against the possessor in addition to the recovery of the possession or whether the unlawful possessor could have any damage compensation or other compensation claims against the co-defendants who signed contracts with the possessor without legal grounds, is justified.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nOn the basis of the above stated circumstances, the action of the Republic of Estonia shall be satisfied also against AS BPV as a defendant and the construction works at the addresses of K\u00fcti 17 and 17A shall be recovered from the possession by AS BPV.\n\nAs the action against AS BPV shall be satisfied due to the justifications stated above and there is no requirement whatsoever to identify whether AS BPV is a possessor in good faith or not, the statements in clauses 2.2, 2.4 of the plaintiff's appeal are also of no importance and the Circuit Court shall not assess these statements.331\n\nMarch 2006 Appeal Judgment, p. 39 (**C-081**).\n\nMarch 2006 Appeal Judgment, p. 39 (**C-081**).\n\nMarch 2006 Appeal Judgment, p. 39 (**C-081**).\n\n300.\n\nWith respect to the remaining aspects of the July 2005 Judgment, the Circuit Court considered that it \"fully agree[d] with the justifications stated in the challenged judgment and thus [did] not consider it necessary to repeat these justifications.\"332 In its view, the City Court \"correctly applied the provisions of the substantial law and ha[d] justifiably satisfied the action of the Republic of Estonia.\"333\n\nMarch 2006 Appeal Judgment, p. 41 (**C-081**).\n\nMarch 2006 Appeal Judgment, p. 41 (**C-081**).\n\n*vii. Cassation Appeal*\n-----------------------\n\n301.\n\nOn 27 March 2006, BPV filed a cassation appeal in respect of the March 2006 Appeal Judgment before the Supreme Court of Estonia.334 Agrin, Verest and Ela Tolli also filed a separate cassation appeal on 30 March 2006.335\n\nSupreme Court of Estonia, *Estonia v.

Verest and others*, Case No. 3-7-1-2-229, 7 June 2006 (**C-082**).\n\n302.\n\nBy judgment of 7 June 2006, the Supreme Court decided not to hear the appeal to the March 2006 Judgment.336\n\nSupreme Court of Estonia, *Estonia v. Verest and others*, Case No. 3-7-1-2-229, 7 June 2006 (**C-082**). The Supreme Court of Estonia has discretion to decide whether to hear a cassation appeal.

Enforcement*\n-------------------\n\n303.\n\nOn 19 June 2006, Bailiff Arvi Pink notified BPV, Agrin and Verest that enforcement proceedings of the March 2006 Appeal Judgment had been commenced and requested them to inform him about the voluntary compliance with the enforcement of such decision.337 The Bailiff further noted that in the absence of voluntary compliance, eviction would take place on 1 August 2006.338\n\nBPV Immovable Property Eviction Execution, 19 June 2006 (**C-129**); Agrin Immovable Property Eviction Execution, 19 June 2006 (**C-130**); Verest Immovable Property Eviction Execution, 19 June 2006 (**C-131**).\n\nBPV Immovable Property Eviction Execution, 19 June 2006 (**C-129**); Agrin Immovable Property Eviction Execution, 19 June 2006 (**C-130**); Verest Immovable Property Eviction Execution, 19 June 2006 (**C-131**).\n\n304.\n\nOn 1 August 2006, Estonia enforced the eviction order pursuant to the March 2006 Appeal Judgment and took possession of the buildings and structures at the Port.339\n\nHarju County Court, *Estonia v.

November 1997 \u2013 01. August 2006 without a legal basis.\"345 On that basis, the Court concluded that Verest, Agrin, BPV, and ELA Tolli had to compensate Estonia for the advantages of use despite the using or non-using of the Port in the amount of EEK 107,420,000 (USD 9,250,000).346\n\nHarju County Court, *Estonia v.

Criminal Proceedings**\n---------------------------\n\n308.\n\nOn 22 September 2006, the Northern District Prosecutor's Office of Estonia commenced criminal proceedings alleging, *inter alia*, the removal and destruction on 1 August 2006 of certain State property and structures located at the Port. Mr. Aleksander Rotko and Ms. Olga Kotova, a board member of the Claimant and then the wife of Mr. Rotko, were identified as suspects in the mentioned criminal investigation.347 After leaving Estonia in 2006, Mr. Rotko returned to the United States,348 and Ms. Kotova spent some time in Russia with relatives (before she lived in Canada for four years and moved to the United States in 2011).349\n\nLetter from Prosecutor Andrei Voronin, \"Request to extend the term for holding in custody\" re Olga Kotova, 18 November 2016, p. 2 (**C-004**).\n\nFirst Rotko Statement, \u00b6 6.\n\nWitness Statement of Ms. Olga Kotova dated 29 August 2019, \u00b6 39 (**CWS-3**).\n\n309.\n\nOn 25 August 2007, the Harju County Court in Estonia ordered that the suspects Mr. Rotko and Ms. Kotova be taken into custody as a preventive measure.350 On 29 August 2007, European arrest warrants were issued with regard to both suspects.351\n\nExpert Evidence of Paul Keres, 9 December 2019, Exhibit 1, Harju County Court Ruling, 25 August 2007, pp. 16-25 (**C-280**).\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 65; Second Rotko Statement, \u00b6 96 (**CWS-2**); Letter from Prosecutor Andrei Voronin, \"Request to extend the term for holding in custody\" re: Olga Kotova, 18 November 2016, p. 1 (**C-004**).\n\n310.\n\nIn early 2013, Estonia filed a request to the competent U.S. judicial authority for the extradition of Mr. Rotko to Estonia,352 based on the Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and Estonia.353\n\n*See* Expert Evidence of Paul Keres, 9 December 2019, Exhibit 4, Request for Extradition of Aleksandr Rotko from the Northern District Prosecutor's Office, 30 January 2013, pp. 62-72 (**C-280**); Respondent's Response to the Claimant's Request for Interim Relief, \u00b6 7; Request for Extradition of a Citizen of the Republic of Estonia Aleksandr Rotko, 13 March 2013 (**C-290**).\n\nExtradition Treaty between the United States of America and Estonia, signed on 8 February 2006 (**RLA-040**).\n\n311.\n\nOn 8 August 2016, Ms. Kotova was detained in Finland on the basis of the above-mentioned European arrest warrant and on 23 September 2016, she was extradited to Estonia.354 On 8 December 2016, the Prosecutor's Office of Estonia issued an order on termination of criminal proceedings against Ms. Kotova.

If some of these arguments are not addressed below, this shall not be taken as an indication that the Tribunal has not considered them relevant. Rather, such arguments were unable to influence the decision of the Tribunal on the Parties' requests or individual issues based on the Tribunal's reasoning.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY**\n-------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal can address the merits of this dispute only if and to the extent that it has jurisdiction and the Claimant's claims are admissible.\n\n328.\n\nThe basis of the Tribunal's jurisdiction is Article VI of the Treaty, which reads in material parts as follows.\n\n1. For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to:\n\n(a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company;\n\n(b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or\n\n(c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n...\n\n(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); [\u2026]\n\n4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3 [\u2026].375\n\nTreaty, Article VI (**RLA-001**).\n\n329.\n\nThe Claimant has initiated these arbitration proceedings by submitting a Notice of Arbitration pursuant to the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, as provided for in Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty, and in compliance with the six-month waiting period set out in this provision. Respondent has consented to the submission of any investment dispute to arbitration, according to Article VI(4) of the Treaty. Therefore, the scope of the Respondent's consent\u2014and consequently of the Tribunal's jurisdiction\u2014hinges on whether and to what extent this dispute constitutes an investment dispute within the meaning of Article VI(1) of the Treaty. Given that the two categories of investment disputes listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this provision are irrelevant here, the Tribunal must determine whether and to what extent this dispute is brought by \"a national or company\" of the U.S. \"arising out of or relating to [\u2026] an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment\", as set out in Article VI(1)(c).\n\n330.\n\nThe term \"investment\" is key in this regard. It is defined in Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty, which provides that:\n\nInvestment means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:\n\n(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\n(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;\n\n(iv) intellectual property which includes, *inter alia*, rights relating to:\n\nliterary and artistic work, including sound recordings, inventions in all fields of human endeavor, industrial designs, semiconductor mask works, trade secrets, know-how, and confidential business information, and trademarks, service marks, and trade names; and\n\n(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law.376\n\nTreaty, Article I(1)(a) (**RLA-001**).\n\n331.\n\nThe term \"company\" is defined in Article I(1)(b) of the Treaty as any kind of corporation, company, association, partnership, or other organization, legally constituted under applicable laws and regulations of a Party whether or not organized for pecuniary gain, or privately or governmentally owned or controlled.377\n\nTreaty, Article I(1)(b) (**RLA-001**).\n\n332.\n\nWith these observations in mind, the Tribunal now turns to the Respondent's objections regarding jurisdiction and inadmissibility, namely that:\n\n(a) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* because the true identity of the Claimant is unclear,378 and the only link between the Claimant and the alleged investment is Mr. Rotko, an Estonian national;379\n\n(b) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because the Claimant failed to prove ownership or control of investments in Estonia within the meaning of the US-Estonia BIT,380 and the alleged investments were obtained illegally and in bad faith;381\n\n(c) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the Claimant's claims because they pertain to measures taken by the Respondent before the entry into force of the US-Estonia BIT on 16 February 1997;382\n\n(d) the claims are time-barred under the principles of acquiescence and extinctive prescription;383 and\n\n(e) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant's claim for moral damages.384\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 33-36, 426-444; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 3-21, 287-302.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 31-37; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 37; 466-476; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 24 (where, unlike in the Statement of Defense and the Counter-Memorial, the Respondent treats the alleged illegality of the investment and bad faith as issues of admissibility and not of jurisdiction), 328-330.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 40.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 452-465; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 309-327.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 18; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 35; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 303-308.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal will address each of these points in turn.\n\n**A. The Tribunal's Jurisdiction Ratione Personae**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nIn its Statement of Defense, the Respondent argued that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* for two reasons. First, according to the Respondent, the true identity of the Claimant is unclear because publicly available data suggest that there are two entities named ELA USA: one incorporated in Florida in 2013, the other registered in Minnesota in 1993.385 Secondly, according to the Respondent, the Claimant does not qualify as an investor within the meaning of the Treaty because it failed to establish that the Claimant\u2014and not Mr. Rotko\u2014owned or controlled an investment in Estonia.386\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt as to the identity of the Claimant in this case. In his second witness statement, submitted with the Claimant's Memorial, Mr. Rotko stated that he set up ELA, the Claimant, in Minnesota in 1993. When Mr. Rotko moved to Florida in 2013, he domesticated the company there, where it continues to operate. Documentary evidence confirms Mr. Rotko's testimony. The Claimant submitted a certificate of incorporation issued by the State of Minnesota in 1993,387 a certificate of domestication in Florida signed in 2013,388 and an excerpt from the webpage of the Florida Department of State dated 19 December 2020 confirming the active status of ELA.389\n\nELA USA Certificate of Incorporation and Articles of Incorporation, 6 April 1993 (**C-044**); Florida corporation domestication \u2013 ELA USA \u2013 2013, 6 November 2013 (**C-210**); State of Florida Corporations website \u2013 confirmation of status of ELA U.S.A. Inc, 19 December 2020 (**C-553**).\n\nELA USA Certificate of Incorporation and Articles of Incorporation, 6 April 1993 (**C-044**).\n\nFlorida corporation domestication \u2013 ELA USA \u2013 2013, 6 November 2013 (**C-210**).\n\n336.\n\nFollowing the submission of the Claimant's Memorial, the Respondent neither explicitly upheld nor withdrew its objections against the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae*. But it did not repeat its doubts regarding the identity of the Claimant. In light of the evidence filed by the Claimant after the Respondent's Statement of Defense, the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over the Claimant, a U.S. company within the meaning of Article I(1)(b) and Article VI(1) of the Treaty. The question of whether ELA owned or controlled an investment is an issue of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, to which the Tribunal turns next.\n\n**B. The Tribunal's Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n337.\n\nRegarding its jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, the Tribunal will first address the Respondent's jurisdictional objection that the Claimant never held a relevant investment in Estonia. If the Tribunal finds that the Claimant held one or more such investments, it must in a second step address the Respondent's allegation that they were made illegally and in bad faith.\n\n**1. Whether the Claimant Owned or Controlled an Investment**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe Tribunal has jurisdiction only if and to the extent that this is a dispute arising from or relating to an alleged breach of a right conferred or created by the Treaty with respect to an investment, as set out in paragraphs 329 and 330 above. According to Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty, protected investments by the Claimant can be \"every kind of investment[s] in the territory of [Estonia] owned or controlled directly or indirectly\" by the Claimant, such as \"tangible and intangible property\", \"shares of stock or other interests in a company\", or \"a right conferred by law or contract\".\n\n339.\n\nThe Claimant characterizes several assets, rights, and interests it allegedly owned or controlled in Estonia as investments protected by the Treaty, namely the shares in four Estonian entities (BPV, Verest, Agrin, and ELA Tolli); the Seaplane Harbor (or at least certain buildings and structures located at the Seaplane Harbor); the lease agreements BPV concluded with Verest and Agrin and the rights arising from the lease; the joint venture agreement, and loans. The Respondent disputes that the Claimant owned or controlled any of these assets, which the Tribunal will address in turn.\n\n**a) Shares in BPV, Verest, ELA Tolli, and Agrin**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant has failed to substantiate that it owned or controlled BPV, Verest, ELA Tolli, and Agrin at the time of the alleged breaches, *i.e.*, between 1999 and 2006, and more specifically on 7 June 2006 when the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal from the Circuit Court's decision of 1 March 2006 according to which Estonia was the rightful owner of the building at the Port.390\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 433-434. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 429-432.\n\n341.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, the Respondent argued that the sole shareholder of BPV, Verest, and ELA Tolli at the time of the alleged breaches of the Treaty was Corona Resources, and that there was no evidence that the Claimant ever owned or controlled Corona Resources.391 Regarding Mr. Rotko's witness testimony submitted with the Reply that Corona Resources was always wholly owned and controlled by the Claimant, the Respondent states that the Claimant's evidence is insufficient under Panamanian law to establish ownership in a Panamanian company.392 According to Mr. Molina, the Respondent's expert witness, the Claimant would have had to provide original share certificates or a share registry issued by the corporation to establish ownership.393\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 433-438.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 292, *referring to* Expert Witness Statement of Mr. Raul Molina (\"**Molina Report**\"), 8 July 2021 (**RER-4**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 292, *referring to* Molina Report (**RER-4**).\n\n342.\n\nThe Respondent points out that, in any event, the discussion regarding the Claimant's ownership of Corona Resources has become redundant because the Respondent has learned, when preparing its Rejoinder, that Corona Resources never existed.394 The Respondent submits that, as confirmed by its expert witness, Mr. Raul Eduardo Molina, and conceded by the Claimant, no company by the name of Corona Resources exists or has existed in Panama.395 According to the Respondent, the Claimant \"knew or must have known all along that Corona Resources does not exist\" as it merely relied on Mr. Rotko's words as the sole source of evidence.396 Similarly, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to provide any documentary evidence in support of its \"proclamations of innocence and ignorance with respect to the use of the non-existent Corona Resources.\"397\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 287-290.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 289-290, *referring to* Molina Report, \u00b6 13 (**RER-4**). *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 130:8-11.\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 30. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 132:6-10.\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33.\n\n343.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, in the absence of Corona Resources, the Claimant has failed to show that it had any equity interest in any of its purported subsidiaries and Agrin during the alleged breaches because:398\n\n(a) There is no record showing from whom Corona Resources acquired shares in BPV and to whom these shares should revert absent such acquisitions.399 While the Claimant alleges that it wholly owned and controlled BPV from 1995, it is also unclear when and from whom the Claimant acquired BPV shares.400 As for the Share Purchase Agreement dated 20 November 2000, which purportedly evidences ELA's sale of BPV shares to Corona Resources,401 the Respondent maintains its objections to the admissibility of the document, which was \"filed long after the relevant issue arose and after all imaginable cut-off dates have come and gone in this arbitration.\"402 Further, the Respondent challenges the authenticity of the document, contending that it is not consistent with the testimony of Mr. Rotko and the contemporaneous documentary record.403 Consequently, it considers that the Claimant has not submitted any credible evidence with respect to the transaction in which Corona Resources acquired shares in BPV;404\n\n(b) Given that Verest was owned by BPV from 23 September 1999 until it was purportedly transferred to Corona Resources in 2004, Verest was therefore only ever owned either by BPV (whose connection to the Claimant is not proven, as set out in subparagraph (a)) or by non-existent Corona Resources;405 and\n\n(c) As ELA Tolli was established by Mr. Toomas Rinne on 1 December 2000 before it was sold to Corona Resources, ELA Tolli would continue to be owned by Mr. Rinne, who is unrelated to these proceedings.406\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 40. The Respondent submits that even Mr. Keres admitted that the evidence he relied on does not show who the last owner was for any of the Estonian companies prior to Corona Resources. In any event, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal has no basis to entertain the Claimant's alternative theory on its ownership of the alleged investment in the absence of Corona Resources. *See* 3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 35; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 156:20-23.\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 36. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 130:21-22.\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 36. The Respondent notes that, only seven weeks before the hearing, the Claimant produced documents to evidence that STC International agreed to transfer all of its shares in BPV (*i.e.*, 51% of total BPV shares) to the Claimant and that the Claimant became the owner of 91% of BPV shares by 1997. The Respondent considers these documents belated and inadmissible, given that they were filed without leave from the Tribunal. In any event, the Respondent argues that these documents do not lead to who was the owner of BPV immediately before Corona Resources. *See* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 131:14 \u2013 132:19, *referring to* Agreement between STC and ELA USA, 1 March 1996 (**C-599**); BPV Corporate Minutes, 25 June 1997 (**C-600**). *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 135:5-13.\n\nClaimant's Answers to the Tribunal's Questions, Agreement of Purchase and Sale of Shares of BPV from ELA USA to Corona Resources, 20 November 2000 (**C-612**).\n\n21 April 2022 Submission, p. 1.\n\n21 April 2022 Submission, pp. 1-3, *referring to* Hearing Transcript, Day 2, pp. 20:6-22, 22:2 \u2013 23:9; Commercial Register extract of BPV (**R-012**). *See also* Annex 2 to the 21 April 2022 Submission.\n\n21 April 2022 Submission, p. 3.\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 37.\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 39.\n\n344.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimant's lack of equity interest in Agrin at the relevant time is fatal to the majority of its claim. According to the Respondent, while BPV became the owner of Agrin after its purchase on 8 December 1999, it then sold its stake to Ella Kaubanduse, another Estonian company belonging to Mr. Rotko, on 22 March 2001.407 Ella Kaubanduse, the Respondent continues, remained the sole shareholder of Agrin until Agrin was deleted from the Commercial Register on 31 July 2013.408 As Ella Kaubanduse was wholly owned by Mr. Rotko at the time of the alleged breaches, the Respondent argues that no corporate linkage exists between Agrin and the Claimant, other than the fact that they were both owned by Mr. Rotko, who is neither a claimant in this arbitration nor a \"national of the other Party.\"409\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 26; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 442, *referring to* Sale Contract between BPV and Alcedo for the sale of Agrin, 8 December 1999 (**C-057**); Share purchase agreement between BPV and Ella Kaubanduse for the sale of Agrin, 22 March 2001 (**R-150**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 442, *referring to* Commercial Register extract of Agrin, 7 December 2018 (**R-015**).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 27; *referring to* Treaty, Article I(1)(a) (**RLA-001**); Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 443-444.\n\n*ii. The Claimant's Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n345.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the Respondent's jurisdictional objection with respect to the Claimant's standing should be dismissed because BPV, Verest, ELA Tolli, and Agrin were directly or indirectly owned and controlled by ELA, a U.S. company.410 While the Claimant concedes that the ownership structure of the Claimant's investments underwent some modifications between 1997 and 2007, the transfer of ownership, according to the Claimant, does not affect the Claimant's standing to bring its claim in this arbitration.411\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 886, 919-920.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 892, 931.\n\n346.\n\nIn respect of BPV, the Claimant asserted until the submission of the Respondent's Rejoinder that BPV was initially owned and controlled by ELA before ELA's subsidiary, Corona Resources, acquired all of its shares.412 The Claimant explained that Corona Resources was owned and controlled by ELA, acting as its bare trustee without any active business operations, employees, or offices.413 Therefore, according to the Claimant, when Corona Resources acquired BPV from ELA, there was \"no change to any operations\" as ELA \"always controlled and owned\" Corona Resources.414\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 893(1)-(2).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 893(2), 923, *referring to* Second Rotko Statement, \u00b6 39 (**CWS-2**); Third Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 24 (**CWS-4**). *See* Letter from Corona Resources, 2 September 1999 (**C-556**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 893(2), 924.\n\n347.\n\nIn the same vein, the Claimant asserted that it controlled and indirectly owned Verest after BPV purchased the entire shares of the company on 23 September 1999.415 The Claimant further notes that ELA owned and controlled ELA Tolli through Corona Resources from its creation in 2000 until its seizure by Estonia in 2007.416 On this basis, the Claimant emphasizes that it \"always\" owned and controlled BPV, Verest, and ELA Tolli from 1999 until 2007, *i.e.*, when the Respondent seized BPV, Verest, ELA Tolli, and Agrin.417\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 924, 931; Third Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 24 (**CWS-4**). *See* Share Purchase Agreement between BPV and Verest, 23 September 1999 (**C-055**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 897(6), 897(c). *See* Shareholder list as of 07.06.2006 of ELA Tolli (**R-149**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 888-890, 897.\n\n348.\n\nThe Claimant now concedes that Corona Resources never existed and, consequently, did not have the legal capacity to enter into transactions with ELA.418 But according to the Claimant, Corona Resources' invalidity has no impact on the Claimant's claim in this arbitration.419 This is because, relying on Mr. Keres' analysis, the Claimant contends that the share transactions concluded by Corona Resources with respect to BPV, Verest, and Ella Tolli are void *ab initio* under Article 26(1) of the Estonian General Part of the Civil Code Act.420 Accordingly, the Claimant posits that, as a matter of Estonian law, the transactions entered with Corona Resources by ELA and BPV would be void *ex tunc* without having to go to a court for determination.421 As such, the corporate structure of ELA would revert to its \"original form\" in 1999, *i.e.*, before the transactions with Corona Resources took place, where ELA was the corporate parent wholly owning BPV, which, in turn, owned Verest and ELA Tolli.422\n\n1 December 2021 Submission, \u00b6 18; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 57:2-7. The Claimant explains that Mr. Rotko had always relied upon local Panamanian lawyers for the registration and annual maintenance of Corona Resources and, therefore, was not aware that Corona Resources may not have been a valid company under the laws of Panama until this arbitration was commenced. Therefore, the Claimant submits that ELA and Mr. Rotko are \"victims of fraud, rather than the perpetrators\" as they reasonably relied on the authenticity and completeness of the documents provided by the Panamanian lawyers. *See* 1 October 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 53-55, 58-62; 1 December 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 18. *See also* Fifth Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, 11-12 (**CWS-6**).\n\n1 December 2021 Submission, \u00b6 38.\n\n1 October 2021 Submission, \u00b6 71, *referring to* Fourth Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66 (**CER-8**); Claimant's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6\u00b6 66-67, *referring to* Hearing Transcript, Day 4, 75:1-9.\n\n1 October 2021, Submission, \u00b6 71; Fourth Keres Report, \u00b6 66 (**CER-8**).

The Tribunal's Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nBefore turning to the individual Estonian entities that Claimant alleges to have held, a few general remarks on Corona Resources seem helpful.\n\n353.\n\nThere was much discussion about Corona Resources in the Parties' written submissions since the Respondent had pointed out in its Statement of Defense that, according to the commercial register, Corona Resources\u2014and not the Claimant\u2014owned BPV, Verest, and ELA Tolli.431 In the view of the Tribunal, large parts of this discussion have become irrelevant for the following reasons.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 26.\n\n354.\n\nAfter attempting to gather information on Corona Resources in Panama, Respondent submitted in its Rejoinder that Corona Resources has never existed. Having subsequently investigated the matter itself, the Claimant concluded that it and Mr. Rotko had become victims of fraud by a Panamanian lawyer, who was paid by the Claimant but apparently did not take the necessary steps for the incorporation of Corona Resources.432 At the latest since the oral hearing, the Parties agree that Corona Resources was never a valid company.433 The Parties also agree that, as a matter of Estonian law, all transactions with Corona Resources are considered to be void *ab initio*, and all shares transferred to Corona Resources revert to their original owners.434 The Parties disagree, however, on who these original owners were. With these observations in mind, the Tribunal will now address, one by one, the Estonian entities in which the Claimant asserts to have held direct or indirect shareholdings.\n\nClaimant's 1 October 2022 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 46; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 130:6\u201312; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 156:25\u2013157:1; Claimant's PHB, \u00b6 67.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 130:18\u201321; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 157:2-3.\n\n*(I.) BPV*\n----------\n\n355.\n\nTo determine whether the Claimant held an investment protected by the Treaty in the form of shares in BPV, the Tribunal will address the relevant, partly contested, transactions in chronological order. According to BPV's founding agreement, the Claimant held a 40% stake in BPV when it was established in 1993.435 Mr. Rotko states in his second witness statement that, beyond its original 40% shareholding, the Claimant solely owned and controlled BPV since 1995.436 A settlement agreement dated 1 March 1996 submitted by the Claimant several weeks before the oral hearing contradicts this statement. In that agreement, STC International, who originally held a 51% stake in BPV, promised to transfer all its shares in BPV to the Claimant.437 If the Claimant had already solely owned BPV in 1995, it would have been nonsensical to commit STC International to transfer all its shares in BPV to the Claimant in 1996.\n\nBPV Foundation Agreement, 22 December 1993 (**C-076**).\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6 14 (**CWS-2**).\n\nAgreement between STC and ELA USA, 1 March 1996, section 5 (**C-599**).\n\n356.\n\nThe documentary evidence indicates, however, that STC International's shares in BPV were transferred to the Claimant at some point. According to the minutes of a BPV shareholder meeting held on 25 June 1997, the Claimant directly owned 91% of the shares in BPV on that date.438 This figure corresponds to the Claimant's original 40% stake plus STC International's original 51% stake. As regards the remaining 9% of the shares in BPV, the Claimant submitted an agreement dated 20 October 1999, which states that the Claimant acquired those shares from Ella Kaubanduse.439 Further documentary evidence seems to confirm that the Claimant owned 100% of the shares in BPV, at least during parts of the relevant period. A share purchase agreement dated 20 November 2000 states that ELA transfers \"100% of the share capital\" in BPV to Corona Resources.440 In line with this purported share transfer, two subsequent documents list Corona Resources as BPV's sole shareholder, namely minutes regarding a shareholder decision dated 9 March 2001 and the Commercial Register extract of BPV.441 The Commercial Register records Corona Resources as the only shareholder of BPV for the period from 1 January 2000 until BPV's deletion on 1 July 2011 (and notes that the register provides information only on shareholders who hold more than 10% of the votes).\n\nBPV Corporate Minutes, 25 June 1997 (**C-600**); BPV Foundation Agreement, 22 December 1993 (**C-076**).\n\nAgreement between Ella Kaubanduse and ELA USA, 20 October 1999 (**C-601**).\n\nAgreement of Purchase and Sale of Shares of BPV from ELA USA to Corona Resources, 20 November 2000, section 1.2. (**C-612**).\n\nMinutes of the Decision of Sole Shareholder of BPV, 9 March 2001 (**R-146**); Commercial Register extract of BPV, 7 December 2018 (**R-012**).\n\n357.\n\nIn summary and considering that all transactions with Corona Resources are to be considered void, the documentary record suggests that the Claimant owned 40% of the shares in BPV from its establishment in 1993, increased the shareholding to 91% by 25 June 1997, acquired the remaining shares through an agreement dated 20 October 1999, and remained BPV's sole shareholder until that company's dissolution in 2011.\n\n358.\n\nBut the Tribunal needs to address two other issues raised by the Respondent before it can conclude that the Claimant owned an investment within the meaning of the Treaty in the form of shares in BPV. First*,* Respondent alleges that it is unclear who owned BPV immediately before the purported transfer of all shares to Corona Resources, and that it is therefore uncertain to which entity those shares revert because of the non-existence of Corona Resources. In this regard, the Claimant has submitted, after the oral hearing and upon request by the Tribunal, the document through which Corona Resources purportedly acquired the shares in BPV from the Claimant, namely the agreement dated 20 November 2000 (C-612), referred to in paragraph 356 above. Even if the Tribunal were to disregard C-612, it could not find any indication on file regarding a transfer of the shares in BPV to any company other than the Claimant (apart from the failed transfer to Corona Resources). In short, the proposition that the non-existence of Corona Resources renders an entity other than the Claimant the owner of the shares in BPV is speculative and contradicted by C-612.\n\n359.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent states that the Tribunal must ignore certain documents regarding the Claimant's shareholding in BPV because they were filed too late, constitute forgeries, or both.442\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 132:2-4; 3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 36; 21 April 2022 Submission, p. 3.\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal would have expected several documents in this arbitration to be filed earlier. This is true, for example, for C-599, C-600, and C-601 (referred to in paragraphs 355-356 above), which Mr. Rotko found in November 2021 when he \"investigated a set of twenty-year-old documents held in a storage locker\".443 C-612, the agreement through which Corona Resources sought to acquire the shares in BPV from the Claimant, was filed only upon request by the Tribunal, and, according to the Claimant, after a \"hard review\" by Mr. Rotko, who located the document in November 2021, which \"had been misfiled in 2006 with his personal immigration records\".444 But given that the Respondent has had the opportunity to comment on the relevant documents, and that they help in determining what entities held the shares in BPV over time, the Tribunal would find it inappropriate to ignore these documents. On 18 May 2022, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to admit C-612 into the record. The Tribunal will not treat the other documents regarding BPV\u2014filed in late 2021, that is, prior to the oral hearing and the submission of C-612\u2014differently.\n\n1 December 2021 Submission, \u00b6 26.\n\n6 May 2022 Submission, \u00b6 3.\n\n361.\n\nHaving decided that it will not ignore any documents submitted by the Parties because they could or should have been filed earlier, the Tribunal must now address the Respondent's allegations of forgery. In particular, the Respondent disputes the authenticity of Corona Resources' bearer share certificate of 1 May 1996 (C-589), the agreement through which Corona Resources sought to acquire the shares in BPV from the Claimant dated 20 November 2000 (C-612), and the minutes regarding the shareholder's decision to increase BPV's share capital dated 9 March 2001 (R-146).445 In the Respondent's view, the non-existence of Corona Resources \"inevitably renders its share certificate [\u2026] a forgery.446 The Tribunal considers it unnecessary to take a view on whether or not this statement is correct. The share certificate dated 1 May 1996 says nothing more than that the unnamed bearer of the document owns 100% of the shares in Corona Resources. The document is irrelevant regarding the question what entity owns the shares in BPV.\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 36; 21 April 2022 Submission, p. 3.\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\n362.\n\nNor does the shareholder structure of BPV hinge on the authenticity of C-612. It is common ground between the Parties that this agreement has no legal effect because Corona Resources never existed, and the Respondent alleges forgery as an additional reason for this lack of legal effect. As set out in paragraph 358 above, C-612 supports the proposition that in light of the non-existence of Corona Resources, the shares revert back to the Claimant and not to some other, unspecified entity, a theoretical possibility identified by the Respondent. Regarding the documents related to BPV, the Respondent raises its most specific allegations of forgery with respect to C-612. And while the Claimant's case does not depend on C-612 being part of the record, its case would certainly be undermined if the Tribunal were convinced that this document, which contains Mr. Rotko's signature, constitutes a forgery prepared at some point between 1 December 2021 and 25 March 2022, as suggested by the Respondent.447 But based on the preponderance of evidence\u2014and under any higher standard of proof that may be applicable regarding accusations of forgery\u2014the Tribunal is not convinced that C-612 is an inauthentic document, for the following reasons.\n\n*See* 21 April 2022 Submission, p. 3: \"The Claimant then filed additional documents on 1 December 2021 [\u2026] Had a similar agreement existed between ELA USA Inc as the seller and Corona Resources S.A. as the buyer, the Claimant would no doubt have submitted it.\"\n\n363.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that the date provided on C-612\u2014that is, 20 November 2000\u2014is inconsistent with Mr. Rotko's testimony, which reads as follows.\n\nQ. Do you have the agreement by which Corona Resources purchased the shares in BPV?\n\nA. I do not remember. I think we submitted that agreement. It was on the Business Register -- yes, it is there on the Estonian Business Register, so you can take it from there. All the documents are there, they are all filed in the Business Register. I do remember that.\n\nQ. Is it not true, Mr Rotko, that in your second witness statement you said that you were not aware that the Estonian Business Register even existed before this arbitration started?\n\nA. It's not that I was not aware; I didn't use the Business Register. It was all done by my assistant; I did not do that. I do understand it exists now and that something can be taken from there.\n\nQ. Was it you who signed the agreement for the sale of shares in BPV to Corona?\n\nA. I do not remember. I need to look [at] it in the documents.\n\nQ. Do you remember when that could have happened?\n\nA. As far as I can recall, that was in 2001. If my memory serves, around March 2001, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nQ. How come you remember it so precisely?\n\nA. You know, my memory is a strange phenomenon right now: all of a sudden I can remember something or forget something, and it's out of my control. You know, it's like a flashback. I see a document and I remember: yes, that's it, this is pretty serious. So if I remember something, I do remember it; if not, I ask to look in the documents.\n\n7 Q. So you had a flashback right now concerning the signing of the agreement in March 2001?\n\nA. Yes, I remembered it.\n\nQ. Okay.448\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, pp. 23:2-24:10.\n\n364.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Mr. Rotko's recollection of the date of the purported transaction between the Claimant and Corona Resources as well as other facts regarding the agreement between the Claimant and Corona Resources was at best vague. This was the Tribunal's impression at the oral hearing, and it is confirmed by the verbatim transcript reproduced above. Mr. Rotko could not even remember whether it was him who signed the agreement or someone else (\"I do not remember. I need to look [at] it in the documents\").449 Nor did Mr. Rotko make a definitive statement regarding the precise date on which the agreement was allegedly concluded (\"As far as I can recall, that was in 2001. If my memory serves, around March 2001, if I'm not mistaken\").450 In addition, Mr. Rotko stated that the agreement is part of the Estonian Business Register (\"yes, it is there on the Estonian Business Register, so you can take it from there. All the documents are there, they are all filed in the Business Register. I do remember that\").451 But it seems undisputed between the Parties that the Estonian Business Register does not contain copies of documents, as confirmed by the Claimant after the hearing.452 In sum, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the inconsistencies between Mr. Rotko's recollections and the date provided on C-612 justify the conclusion that the document is forged.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 23:19-20; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 23:22-23.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 23:22-23. In the Tribunal's view, Mr. Rotko's recollection did not become more precise when asked by Respondent's counsel whether he \"had a flashback right now concerning the signing of the agreement in March 2001\" (Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 24:7-8). Mr. Rotko replied to this question \"Yes, I remembered it\". The past tense suggests that Mr. Rotko referred to his earlier statement and did not intend to add precision to his previous testimony.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 23:4-8.\n\n6 May 2022 Submission, \u00b6 9.\n\n365.\n\nNor is the Tribunal convinced by the other points Respondent raises in support of the alleged inauthenticity of C-612. The Respondent notes that C-612 was signed on behalf of Corona Resources by Mr. Frank Tuuksam, who according to a newspaper article was involved in \"a high-tech scheme to steal millions\" in the 1990s, and not by Mr. Rotko, allegedly the sole representative of Corona Resources.453 The Tribunal accepts the Claimant's explanation that Mr. Tuuksam was provided with a temporary power of attorney for that transaction only.454 This seems plausible, given that Mr. Rotko signed the agreement on behalf of the Claimant and could hardly sign on behalf of both entities. The Tribunal also wishes to note that contacts or dealings with individuals suspected of or convicted for criminal behavior do not mean that Claimant or Mr. Rotko engaged in criminal activities. This is true with respect to both Mr. Tuuksam and Mr. Arrocha Graell, the lawyer hired by the Claimant for the registration of Corona Resources.\n\n21 April 2022 Submission, pp. 2-3.\n\n6 May 2022 Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\n366.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the date of the purported share transfer from the Claimant to Corona Resources provided in C-612 (that is, 20 November 2000) is inconsistent with the Estonian Commercial Register, which states that Corona Resources was BPV's shareholder from 1 January 2000. But the Commercial Register itself contains a caveat that it provides data on shareholders for information purposes only.455 Furthermore, the Register does not provide a comprehensive history of a company's shareholder structure. For example, the Commercial Register identifies 10 February 1998 as the date of the first entry regarding BPV but mentions no other shareholder than Corona Resources, who became a shareholder\u2014according to the same excerpt\u2014only on 1 January 2000.456\n\nCommercial Register extract of AS BPV (**R-012**), p. 2.\n\nCommercial Register extract of AS BPV (**R-012**), pp. 1-2.\n\n367.\n\nAnother point raised by the Respondent regarding the alleged inauthenticity of C-612 is that this document provides a different street address of the Claimant in Minneapolis (405 Second Avenue) than other documents (8800 Highway), namely the Claimant's certificate of incorporation (C-44) and a BPV shareholder list (C-601, p. 2).457 This difference does, in the Tribunal's view, not support the proposition that C-612 was forged. Other documents on file contain the same address of the Claimant in Minneapolis (405 Second Avenue) as C-612, for example BPV's foundation agreement dated 22 December 1993, and payment orders from the Claimant dated 23 September 1999 and 7 June 2000, all submitted with the Claimant's Memorial on 30 August 2019.458 The explanation for the different addresses seems to be that the 8800 Highway address is not only the address of the registered office of the Claimant provided in its articles of incorporation but also that of the Claimant's incorporator, Mr. Mark Garbuz.459 While the use of the two Minneapolis addresses might not have been fully consistent during the period from 1993 to 2000, this is, in the Tribunal's view, no reason to assume that C-612 is a forgery.\n\n21 April 2022 Submission, p. 3.\n\nBPV Foundation Agreement, 22 December 1993 (**C-076**); Payment order from ELA USA, to Viktor Kaasik (**C-238**); Payment order from ELA USA, to Primultini (**C-235**).\n\nELA USA Certificate of Incorporation and Articles of Incorporation, 6 April 1993, sections II and IV (**C-044**).\n\n368.\n\nNor is the Tribunal persuaded by the Respondent's argument that the lack of a bank or wire transfer from Corona Resources to the Claimant as payment for the shares in BPV speak for the inauthenticity of C-612. The Tribunal has no doubt that, in 2000, Claimant and Corona Resources were fully owned and controlled by Mr. Rotko, even if Corona Resources later turned out to be an invalid company. Hence, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant's explanation that payment for the shares in BPV occurred through internal bookkeeping transactions.460\n\n*See* 6 May 2022 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.\n\n369.\n\nThe Respondent mentions in passing that another document is a forgery: R-146, the 9 March 2001 minutes of Corona Resources (represented by its sole shareholder, Mr. Rotko) to increase the share capital of BPV. No argument is provided as to why that document would be a forgery other than that all documents related to Corona Resources must be a forgery.461 The Tribunal is not convinced by this proposition, as set out in the paragraphs above regarding C-612.\n\n3 November 2022 Submission, \u00b6 36.\n\n370.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that Claimant owned an investment within the meaning of Article I(1)(a)(iii) of the Treaty in the form of the shares in BPV, as specified in paragraph 357 above, which means that Claimant had held a 40% stake in BPV since 1993 that was increased to 91% by 25 June 1997 and to 100% through an agreement dated 20 October 1999. The Claimant remained BPV's sole shareholder until the company's dissolution in 2011.\n\n*(II.) Verest*\n--------------\n\n371.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant's (indirect) ownership of the shares in Verest on grounds that were already addressed in the previous subsection, namely the alleged lack of connection between the Claimant and BPV and the non-existence of Corona Resources.462 Based on the findings above, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant indirectly owned all shares in Verest through BPV from 23 September 1999 to 13 September 2010, for the following reasons.\n\n*See*, e.g. 3 November 2022 Submission, \u00b6 37.\n\n372.\n\nIt seems undisputed that BPV acquired 100% of the shares in Verest from two individuals on 23 September 1999.463 At that point, Claimant held a 91% stake in BPV, and it acquired the remaining 9% stake through an agreement dated 20 October 1999.464 In 2004, BPV sought to transfer its shares in Verest to Corona Resources, but the Parties agree that all transactions involving Corona Resources are void. This means that BPV remained Verest's sole shareholder until Verest's dissolution on 13 September 2010. The documentary record confirms this account. The commercial register excerpt of Verest states that Corona Resources acquired all shares in Verest from BPV on 18 June 2004 and held them until 13 September 2010.465\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 37 and 3 November 2022 Submission, \u00b6 37, *both referring to* Share Purchase Agreement between BPV and Verest, 23 September 1999 (**C-055**).\n\n*See* \u00b6 357 above.\n\nCommercial Register extract of Verest, 7 December 2018 (**R-013**).\n\n373.\n\nThe Claimant's indirect ownership of 100% of the shares in Verest (through BPV) from 23 September 1999 to 13 September 2010 constitutes an investment within the meaning of Article I(1)(a)(iii) of the Treaty.\n\n*(III.) Agrin*\n--------------\n\n374.\n\nBased on the findings above, the Claimant's indirect shareholding in Agrin as well as its duration are straightforward. BPV acquired all shares in Agrin on 8 December 1999 and resold them to Ella Kaubanduse on 22 March 2001.466 Since the Claimant fully owned BPV on 8 December 1999, but never owned Ella Kaubanduse, the Claimant (indirectly) held 100% of the shares in Agrin from 8 December 1999 to 22 March 2001. The Claimant held no shares in Agrin beyond 22 March 2001.\n\nShare Sale Contract between BPV and Alcedo for the sale of Agrin, 8 December 1999 (**C-057**); Share purchase agreement between BPV and Ella Kaubanduse for the sale of Agrin, 22 March 2001 (**R-150**).\n\n*(IV.) ELA Tolli*\n-----------------\n\n375.\n\nThe Parties offer two conflicting theories on who owned ELA Tolli given that Corona Resources was non-existent. The Claimant states that, on 1 June 2002, BPV purported to transfer its interest in ELA Tolli to Corona Resources, and because this transaction was invalid, the Claimant continued to own all shares in ELA Tolli through BPV.467 According to the Respondent, ELA Tolli never had a different owner other than its founder Mr. Toomas Rinne, who sought to sell ELA Tolli to Corona Resources on 14 November 2000.468\n\n1 October 2021 Submission, \u00b6 70; 1 December 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 665; 3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 39.\n\n376.\n\nThe Claimant cites Exhibit R-012 in support of its proposition that full ownership of ELA Tolli returns to BPV.469 But R-012 is the commercial register extract of BPV. ELA Tolli is not even mentioned in this extract. The commercial register extract of ELA Tolli (**R-014**), however, mentions in the section entitled \"shareholders\" only Corona Resources.470 The only other (legal or natural) person listed in the extract as ever having held shares in ELA Tolli is Toomas Rinne. The relevant section states that Mr. Rinne was the \"founder of the company\" and specifies that he held the same number of shares that was later supposedly transferred to Corona Resources.471 Therefore, the information provided in the commercial register extracts on file supports the Respondent's account.\n\n1 October 2021 Submission, \u00b6 70; 1 December 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\nCommercial Register extract of ELA Tolli, 7 December 2018, p. 2 (**R-014**).\n\nCommercial Register extract of ELA Tolli, 7 December 2018, p. 3 (**R-014**).\n\n377.\n\nThe Fourth Expert Report of Mr. Keres contains verbatim the same sentence on the alleged transfer of ownership in ELA Tolli from BPV to Corona Resources as the Claimant's 1 October 2022 submission, including the (inexplicable) reference to R-012.472 During cross-examination, Mr. Keres confirmed that this sentence constitutes merely a factual assumption based on which he rendered his legal opinion. Hence, Mr. Keres' expert report does not support the proposition that BPV (or the Claimant) ever owned shares in ELA Tolli.\n\nFourth Expert Legal Opinion of Paul Keres dated 30 September 2021, \u00b6 63 (**CER-8**).\n\n378.\n\nMr. Rotko briefly stated in his second witness statement that \"in 2000, the Corporate Group was expanded for the last time when we established another company, ELA Tolli (\"Tolli\"), as a subsidiary of ELA.\"473 But BPV is not mentioned in this context. Nor does Mr. Rotko offer any detail or explanation regarding the alleged parent-subsidiary relationship between the Claimant and ELA Tolli. Ms. Kotova was more specific. She testified that ELA Tolli was controlled by the Claimant because ELA Tolli was a \"subsidiary\" of Corona Resources, which was in turn \"simply a holding company, which at all times was controlled by ELA\".474 This statement was made prior to the discovery that Corona Resources was not an existing company, but it seems to imply that Corona Resources was indispensable for the parent-subsidiary relationship between the Claimant and ELA Tolli, given that no mention is made of any shareholding in ELA Tolli by BPV.\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6 35 (**CWS-2**).\n\nWitness Statement of Ms. Olga Kotova dated 29 August 2019, \u00b6 10 (**CWS-3**).\n\n379.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that neither the Claimant nor any of its witnesses commented on Mr. Rinne's role as founder and former shareholder of ELA Tolli (as per the commercial register), discussed by the Respondent in the Counter-Memorial and the 3 November 2021 Submission.\n\n380.\n\nHence, the Tribunal holds that the Claimant did not establish that it has ever held shares in ELA Tolli, either directly or indirectly. It seems that ELA Tolli never had an owner other than Toomas Rinne.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n381.\n\nConsidering the above, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant owned shares qualifying as investments within the meaning of Article I(1)(a)(iii) of the Treaty in BPV (from 1993 until 2011), Verest (from 1999 until 2011), and Agrin (from 1999 until 2001), as specified in paragraphs 357, 373, and 374 above. Regarding the extent of the Claimant's potential investments beyond the ownership of said shares, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize two points.\n\n382.\n\nFirst, it is evident from the wording of Article 1(a) of the Treaty that an investment does not need to be owned *and* controlled by the Claimant to be protected by the Treaty. Rather, the two elements are disjunctive, that is, ownership *or* control are sufficient. But this does extend the scope of protection regarding the relevant share here. This is because there are no indications on file that the Claimant controlled BPV, Verest, or Agrin outside the periods in which the Claimant directly or indirectly owned the relevant shares in these companies, or that the Claimant ever controlled ELA Tolli. All entities, including the Claimant, may have belonged to the same corporate group controlled by the same individual, Mr. Rotko. But Mr. Rotko was not a U.S. national when the alleged breaches of the Treaty occurred, nor when the arbitration was commenced in 2018. To the extent that Mr. Rotko owned or controlled Estonian entities directly, or through non-US members of the corporate group, those Estonian entities and the shares therein do not constitute protected investments under the Treaty.\n\n383.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant's share ownership outlined above satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the Claimant must have owned or controlled an investment within the meaning of the Treaty. But the Tribunal considers it appropriate to analyze what rights and interests invoked by the Claimant in addition to those shares constitute relevant investments. The issues that the Tribunal must address in this context partly overlap with the merits, but the Tribunal considers it unhelpful to wait for the analysis of those issues until a later point in this award. In other circumstances, there may be good reasons to not determine the exact extent of a claimant's investment(s) at the jurisdictional stage, or to apply only a *prima facie* test to certain issues. This can be the case in bifurcated proceedings in which a tribunal deciding on its jurisdiction may not have been fully briefed on issues relevant to both jurisdiction and the merits. No such considerations apply in the present case in which the taking of evidence regarding jurisdiction and the merits has been completed and the Parties have fully argued their respective cases at the Oral Hearing and in their written submissions. Here, determining what rights and interests invoked by the Claimant qualify as investments under the Treaty facilitates and streamlines the Tribunal's analysis. To provide one example, the Respondent argues (rightly, as will be seen below) that only investments made in compliance with the domestic law of the host State and in good faith are protected by the Treaty. This point can be adequately addressed only if it is clear what rights and interests invoked by the Claimant constitute investments within the meaning of the Treaty.\n\n384.\n\nWith these observations in mind, that Tribunal will now address the other proprietary and contractual rights for which the Claimant seeks protection, starting with the alleged ownership of buildings and structures.\n\n**b) Ownership of the Seaplane Harbor**\n---------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimant states that it (indirectly, through its subsidiaries) owned the \"buildings and structures at the Port\",475 and that the \"uncompensated taking of the Lennusadam Port and Portlands in 2006\" entails the Respondent's liability under the Treaty.476 According to the Respondent, the Claimant's subsidiaries never acquired title to the buildings and the structures at the port.477\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 73-74; Reply, \u00b6 793.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 890-891.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 64-144.\n\n*i. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, none of the transactions relied upon by the Claimant validly transferred title and ownership rights to the Claimant because (i) the USSR never obtained title to any of Estonia's assets during the Soviet occupation; (ii) any transaction of Estonia's immovable property by the Soviet military to third parties were illegal under international law; (iii) such illegal transactions were consequently void under Estonian law; (iv) any subsequent transactions by non-owners of the property did not create ownership rights under Estonian law.\n\n387.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that the USSR did not obtain title to any of Estonia's assets, including the property at the Seaplane Harbor, as a result of occupation because the USSR was \"merely an administrator, not the sovereign, of the occupied land.\"478 Due to the unlawful nature of the Soviet occupation achieved by way of the use of force, the Respondent posits that the USSR could not have enjoyed the rights for certain assets as an occupier under the Hague Regulations.479\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 152. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 151-153, *referring to* Eyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation* (2nd ed., OUP, 2004), p. 6 (**RLA-042**); U.S. Department of the Army Field Manual 27-10, *The Law of Land Warfare* (1956), \u00b6 358 (**CLA-158**); *Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970)*, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J.

(ii) all military assets were considered State property, which could not be alienated; and (iii) any transfer of the military assets required express approval from the Ministry of Defense of the USSR, which the Soviet military lacked in concluding the transactions at issue.497 The Respondent further argues that even if the transactions had not contravened Soviet law, \"it was impossible to assume at the time that it was safe and legitimate to buy real estate from the Soviet military\" since by March 1990, it was clear that the occupation regime was about to end.498\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 140-144, 242;

In any event, the Respondent takes the view that the registrations could not have occurred, given that the contracts were most likely forged at a much later date to create a legal basis for the Claimant's presence during the Estonian court proceedings. *See* Statement of Defense, \u00b6 37; Second Keres Report, \u00b6 46 (**CER-2**); Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 196.\n\n398.\n\nAddressing the Claimant's assertion that the 23 January 1992 Resolution was retroactively applied, the Respondent states that neither the Estonian courts nor the Respondent in this arbitration relied on the said Resolution to decide or reason that the transactions concluded by B&E and GT were illegal under Estonia's domestic law.505 Rather, the relevant transactions were illegal on the basis of international law and remained illegal because they were not submitted for re-registration.506 Furthermore, the Respondent states that the Tallinn City Court, in its July 2005 Judgment, mentioned the January 1992 Resolution not in its analysis of the legality of the relevant transactions but as part of the general historical background set out earlier in the judgment.507 The Respondent adds that the ESSR resolutions of 17 July 1990 and 19 December 1990, which suspended transactions with State property and declared the disposals of property by the Soviet military unlawful, were adopted before GT and Nautex concluded their sales transactions (on 17 August 1991).508 As such, the Respondent is of the view that the transactions between GT and Nautex would not have been possible already in light of the two resolutions.509\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 217, *referring to* July 2005 Judgment, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 10 (**C-078**); Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 98-100, *referring to* May 2002 Appeal Judgment (**C-191**); Tallinn City Court, Case No. 2/23-7262/02, Judgment, 4 July 2005 (**C-078**); March 2006 Appeal Judgment, pp. 38-42 (**C-081**). *See also* 3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 100-101.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 99(ii).

The Claimant's Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n403.\n\nEmphasizing that this arbitration is governed by international law, the Claimant rejects the claim that the validity of its transactions involving the property rights of the Seaplane Harbor taken by third parties in good faith during and after occupation should be determined by Estonian domestic law, especially in the context of a long-term occupation.521 Therefore, the Claimant argues that (i) the sale of the military property at the Seaplane Harbor during the occupation period were permitted under the Hague Regulations;522 and (ii) in any event, international law necessitates that transactions taken by the Claimant in good faith must be given legal effect post-occupation, even if the transactions were deemed illegal under the law of occupation.523\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 1028-1029.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 297-298.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 304; Reply, \u00b6 30.\n\n404.\n\nThe Claimant raises doubts regarding the applicability of the Hague Regulations because, in its view, the issue of whether Estonia was under military occupation is a \"contentious\" one.524 To the extent that the ESSR had its own government and foreign policy, \"the provisioning of the allied Soviet military personnel in Estonia would not constitute an occupation.\"525 The Claimant asserts that if there was a military occupation in Estonia, the military installation at the Seaplane Harbor was transferred to the Soviet armed forces in 1940 by the Transfer Instruments and that the Soviet armed forces held an interest in the Seaplane Harbor before selling it to private companies.526 The Claimant further advances that the end of the occupation would have occurred in 1995, one year after the date when the Soviet military withdrew its forces from the territory on 1 June 1994, pursuant to Article 6(3) of the Fourth Geneva Convention.527 The Claimant argues that the Soviet military was entitled to use, deplete, or dispose of the Seaplane Harbor and its facilities during the occupation pursuant to the Hague Regulations.528\n\nReply, \u00b6 1030. The Claimant notes that the issue of whether the law of occupation applies to Estonia is contentious since, to the extent that the ESSR was a State, the provisioning of the allied Soviet military personnel in the State of ESSR would not constitute an occupation. With respect to transitional property questions, the Claimant relies on Professor Crawford's reference to the UK High Court decision in *Jaakson and Roos* that \"in 1940 Estonia was annexed by the USSR [\u2026] and Estonia had become part of the USSR de facto\" and that \"the Republic of Estonia as constituted prior to June 1940, has ceased de facto to have any existence.\" The Claimant states that the Hague Regulations are, in any event, part of the domestic law of Estonia because they are customary international law. *See* Memorial, \u00b6 278; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1030-1036, *referring to* James Crawford, Creation of States in International Law (OUP, 2015), pp. 393-394, 689-690 (**CLA-162**); *Re an Application by Ernst Jaakson & Aarand Roos*, 85 ILR 53 (English High Court, 1990), pp. 54, 57 (**CLA-307**). *See also* Second Keres Report, \u00b6 37 (**CER-2**); Kristen E.

The Tribunal's Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that land, buildings, or structures owned by the Claimant's subsidiaries would constitute investments within the meaning of Article I(1)(a)(i) of the Treaty, that is \"property\" indirectly \"owned\" by the Claimant. The Parties rely on several legal regimes regarding the transfer and ownership of property\u2014namely international law, Soviet law, and Estonian law. According to the Claimant, issues of ownership in this arbitration are governed by international law, and not domestic law.558 The Respondent states that the initial transactions between the Soviet military and private parties were illegal under international law,559 and that the subsequent transfers of ownership to the Claimant's subsidiaries were invalid under Estonian law.560 Against this background, the Tribunal considers it necessary to first comment on the law that is applicable regarding issues of property and ownership in this arbitration.\n\nReply, \u00b6 26.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 145.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 197-199.\n\n*(I.) The Applicable Law*\n-------------------------\n\n415.\n\nThe Treaty lists \"tangible and intangible property\" within the non-exhaustive enumeration of assets in Article I(1)(a) that may qualify as protected \"investment in the territory\" of the host State but it does not define the term \"property\". It is to state the obvious that the Treaty must be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose, as set out and reflected in Article 31 VCLT.\n\n416.\n\nThe Treaty does not contain a general provision regarding the applicable law, nor does it specify what rules govern the issue of whether a foreign investor owns \"property\". In other contexts, however, the Treaty provides guidance on the applicable law. Disputes between the State parties concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaty can be referred \"to an arbitral tribunal for binding decision in accordance with the applicable *rules of international law*\".561 The investor-State dispute resolution clause in Article VI lacks a similar clarification. The reason might be that disputes relating to an alleged breach of the Treaty constitute only one of the three categories of disputes listed in that provision.562 Disputes arising from investment agreements (mentioned under Article VI(1)(a)), for example, are typically governed by domestic law, often by that of the host State\u2014and not by international law.\n\nTreaty, Article VII(1) (**RLA-001**).\n\nTreaty, Article VI(1) (**RLA-001**).\n\n417.\n\nArticle I of the Treaty specifies the law which governs certain issues, but those issues do not include the acquisition and ownership of property. A \"national\" of a party to the Treaty, for example, is a \"natural person who is a national of a Party under *its applicable law*\".563 The absence of a corresponding clarification regarding the ownership of property does, in the view of the Tribunal, not necessarily mean that domestic law is irrelevant in this context. The Annex to the Treaty appears to confirm this point. In sections 1 and 2 of the Annex, the United States reserves its right to make exceptions to national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment regarding, *inter alia*, the \"ownership of real property\". In section 3 of the Annex, Estonia reserves its right to make exceptions to national treatment regarding the \"initial acquisition from the Republic of Estonia and its municipalities of state and municipal property in the course of denationalization and privatization.\" It seems difficult to determine what constitutes (state and municipal) property and the acquisition of that property without considering the host State's domestic law, especially in the context of section 3 of the Annex.\n\nTreaty, Article I(1)(c) (**RLA-001**).\n\n418.\n\nExisting arbitral jurisprudence seems split on what law governs issues of property and its ownership in investment disputes. In *Emmis v. Hungary*, the tribunal held that issues regarding the existence of rights possibly protected by a treaty must be determined by reference to the domestic law under which those rights had arisen. It expressed this principle as follows:\n\nIn order to determine whether an investor/claimant holds property or assets capable of constituting an investment it is necessary in the first place to refer to host State law. Public international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain protections to property rights created according to municipal law.564\n\n*Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Award, 16 April 2014, \u00b6 162 (**RLA-059**).\n\n419.\n\nIn a similar vein, in the *Total v. Argentina* case, the tribunal found that the \"precise content and extent\" of the investor's economic rights must be determined under the host State's legal system.565 Legal scholarship seems to point in the same direction. Professor Schreuer, for example, concluded from his analysis of the relevant jurisprudence that \"[s]ome questions with a bearing on jurisdiction, such as [\u2026] the existence of property rights, are governed by domestic law\".566\n\n*Total S.A. v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Liability, 27 December 2010, \u00b6 39.\n\nChristoph Schreuer, *Jurisdiction and Applicable Law in Investment Treaty Arbitration*, Vol. 1:1, McGill Journal of Dispute Resolution (2014), p. 24 (**RLA-054**).\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that determining whether an investor owns property by way of the host State's law may\u2014at least in theory\u2014lead to different scopes of protection under the same treaty, depending on the State in which the investment is made. Based on this consideration, the tribunal in *Saipem v. Bangladesh* dismissed the view that Bangladeshi law is relevant in determining the meaning of the term \"any kind of property\".567 Professor Schreuer was one of the arbitrators in *Saipem*, but he did not address this part of the tribunal's decision in his scholarly contribution referred to in the previous paragraph, which seems to support the applicability of domestic law.\n\n*Saipem S.p.A. v. The People's Republic of Bangladesh*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/7, Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 March 2007, \u00b6 124 (**CLA-215**).\n\n421.\n\nThe relationship between domestic law and international law in deciding on a tribunal's jurisdiction is, as illustrated above, intricate, and no consistent jurisprudence has developed so far. In the present case, the transitional period that the Parties agree Estonia underwent in the 1990s adds a layer of complexity. The rules that may be applicable either stem from this transitional period or are part of the body of international law applicable to such periods. The Tribunal will start its analysis with the relevant rules of international law. Those rules shed light on the role of domestic law in the present case, as will be seen below.\n\n*(II.) International Law*\n-------------------------\n\n422.\n\nThe Claimant bases its proposition that its subsidiaries had become the owners of the relevant assets by operation of international law on three\u2014arguably alternative but overlapping\u2014grounds, namely that: (i) the USSR had acquired ownership of the Seaplane Harbor in 1940 through the so-called Transfer Instruments; (ii) the sales by the Soviet military to private parties were valid under the international law of occupation; and (iii) the Claimant's subsidiaries acquired the assets because of the *ex factis* rule. The Tribunal will address each of these grounds in turn.\n\n*(A.) Change in Ownership in 1940?*\n-----------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant argues that the Seaplane Harbor was transferred to the military of the USSR through the \"Transfer Instruments\" in 1940, and that \"international law suggests\" that the Soviet Union had become the owner of the port.568 The Claimant does not define the term \"Transfer Instruments\", but the Claimant's expert, Mr. Keres, uses this term as a collective reference to three documents signed between 20 June and 18 July 1940.569 Mr. Keres notes that all of these documents cite as the legal basis for the transactions an Estonian law enacted in 1939, namely the Act of Compulsory Encumbrances for the Needs of State Defense (\"**Compulsory Encumbrances Act**\").570 But this law does not, in the view of Mr. Keres, constitute the proper legal basis for the transactions, given that under that law Estonia and not the USSR would have been the \"beneficiary\".571 According to Mr. Keres, the Transfer Instruments were based on the Mutual Assistance Treaty concluded between Estonia and the USSR on 28 September 1939 (\"**1939 Estonia-USSR Treaty**\" or \"**1939 Treaty**\").572 Mr. Keres adds that in the absence of relevant Estonian law, it is international law that governs any potential transfer of ownership based on that treaty.573\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 187, 275.\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 24 (**CER-2**), *referring to* Instrument of Transfer dated 22 June 1940 (**C-192**); Instrument of Transfer dated 18 July 1940 (**C-193**); Inventory/Assessment List dated 8 July 1940 (**C-194**).\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 24 (**CER-2**).\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 30 (**CER-2**).\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 31 (**CER-2**).\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 32 (**CER-2**).\n\n424.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the 1939 Treaty provided that the relations and mutual obligations of Estonia and the USSR continue to be based on the Peace Treaty of 2 February 1920 and the Treaty of Non-Aggression and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes of 4 May 1932.574 Furthermore, Mr. Keres rightly points out that the 1939 Treaty set out a legal framework for the establishment of Soviet military bases in Estonia.575 But nothing in the treaty\u2014comprising only six articles, accompanied by a five-point confidential protocol\u2014suggests that the Soviet Union would become the owner of any land and buildings constituting or forming part of these bases. To the contrary, Article 3 of the 1939 Treaty grants the USSR merely the right \"to lease\" the relevant bases.576 In line with this provision, Article 5 of the 1939 Treaty confirms that areas allotted for the bases shall remain \"territory of the Republic of Estonia\". Therefore, the 1939 Estonia-USSR Treaty does not support the proposition that the USSR became the owner of the Seaplane Harbor in 1940.\n\n1939 Estonia-USSR Treaty, Preamble, \u00b6 3 (**C-196**).\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 31 (**CER-2**).\n\n1939 Estonia-USSR Treaty, Article 3 (**C-196**).\n\n425.\n\nNor does the text of the Transfer Instruments suggest that the USSR acquired ownership of the Seaplane Harbor in 1940. The documents specify that the \"[b]uildings and land plots [were] taken compulsorily for use\".577 The term \"for use\" indicates that no transfer of ownership was intended. The reference to the Compulsory Encumbrances Act in the Transfer Instruments confirms this point. Encumbrances are rights in connection with certain assets (typically lands or buildings) that survive the transfer of ownership in, or possession of, the relevant asset. But an encumbrance does not turn its holder into the owner of the underlying asset.\n\nInstrument of Transfer dated 22 June 1940, p. 1, table heading (**C-192**); Instrument of Transfer dated 18 July 1940, p. 1, table heading (**C-193**).\n\n426.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant did not revert to the Transfer Instruments following the submission of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial. Furthermore, the Respondent's expert, Mr. Keres, stated with respect to the relevant land at the Hearing that:\n\nI have never made an assertion, and I wouldn't make an assertion, that the land under the buildings ever belonged to anyone other than the Estonian State.578\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 95: 7-10.\n\n427.\n\nConsidering the above, the Tribunal finds that the documents on file suggest that Estonia was the owner of the Seaplane Harbor in 1940 and did not lose ownership through the Transfer Instruments.\n\n*(B.) The Law of Occupation*\n----------------------------\n\n428.\n\nAt the beginning of its analysis of the law of occupation, the Tribunal wishes to clarify two points. First, there is no universal consensus within the international community on whether Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union in the 20th century. The Respondent says it was occupied. The Claimant's view has developed during the proceedings. It first argued that the Soviet military obtained the Seaplane Harbor in 1940 when it occupied Estonia, and that the occupant was entitled to sell the relevant assets to private parties under the Hague Regulations.579 In its Reply, the Claimant raises doubts whether Estonia was occupied and whether the Hague Regulations are applicable.\n\nThe issue of whether occupation law even applies to the situation in Estonia is contentious. While many commentators consider Estonia to have been under military occupation, this is not a clear issue. The ESSR had its own government and foreign policy. To the extent that the ESSR was a State, then the provisioning of allied Soviet military personnel in Estonia would not constitute an occupation.580\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 271-301.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1030.\n\n429.\n\nBut the Claimant does not go further and endorse the proposition that Estonia was not occupied by the Soviet Union. Rather, the Claimant states that Estonia had to respect property rights acquired by private parties such as its subsidiaries because of the *ex factis* rule.581 The Tribunal will address this rule below. In addition, the Tribunal notes that the alternatives to the view that Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union seem to be that either Estonia remained an independent State or that it joined the Soviet Union voluntarily. In those scenarios, it would seem logical that the relevant transactions are governed by Estonian law or Soviet law. These legal regimes are also part of the Tribunal's analysis. As will be seen below, the result of this analysis does not require a finding by the Tribunal on whether\u2014as a matter of international law\u2014Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union.\n\nReply, \u00b6 30.\n\n430.\n\nSecondly, the provisions of the Hague Regulations relied on by the Parties\u2014Article 53 and Article 55\u2014are primary norms of international law under the law of State responsibility. Hence, they constitute international obligations that, if breached, entail the international responsibility of the State to whom the action or omission is attributable under international law. The content of the international responsibility of that State is set out in secondary norms of international law.582 But the legal consequences of an internationally wrongful act of a potential occupant\u2014here, of the Soviet Union\u2014are not relevant in the present case. Rather, the Tribunal must determine the consequences of the reversal of measures adopted by the occupant through the organs of the formerly occupied State. More specifically, the issue is whether the Claimant's subsidiaries became the owners of the Seaplane Harbor, although the Estonian courts declared the relevant transactions void.\n\nSee, e.g., James Crawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries*, (CUP, 2002), pp. 14-16 (**CLA-137**), which is a paperback version, with an introduction by James Crawford, on the International Law Commission Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"**ILC Articles**\") with commentaries, Vol. II, Part Two, 2001 **(CLA-126**).\n\n431.\n\nIdentifying the norms that govern such measures of the returning government is more complex than determining the norms that determine the lawfulness of the measures of the occupant.583 Professor Eyal Benvenisti refers to the latter set of rules as primary norms and to the former as secondary norms of the law of occupation.584 While the use of the term primary norms is consistent with the meaning of that term under the law of State responsibility, the Tribunal considers the term secondary norms misleading here. This is because Professor Benvenisti uses it differently from its established meaning in the law of State responsibility, where secondary norms govern the legal consequences for the State that breached the relevant primary norm. But under the terminology suggested by Professor Benvenisti, secondary norms apply to measures of the returning organs of the formerly occupied State that contradict the measures of the occupant. While the Tribunal will therefore not adopt his terminology, it considers the methodology used by Professor Benvenisti very helpful, and it will form part of the Tribunal's analysis that follows now.\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 337 (**CLA-282**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 330, 337, 342-343 (**CLA-282**).\n\n*(1.) The Relevant Rules and Principles*\n----------------------------------------\n\n432.\n\nTwo different periods of State practice and judicial decisions are relevant in determining and understanding the rules and principles of the law of occupation regarding the reversal of the occupant's measures. As explained by Professor Benvenisti, in the period until 1945, there was no generally recognized duty of returning governments to respect lawful occupation measures.585 Returning governments tended to validate transactions made during the occupation. However, they did so not because of a sense of legal obligation, but for policy reasons, such as ensuring market stability\u2014and without regard for the lawfulness of the occupation measure.586 In general, private actors in occupied territories had to expect that returning governments and their courts might not respect lawful occupation measures and that they might uphold unlawful acts.587\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 330 (**CLA-282**). The legal framework in this regard was, in Benvenisti's view, based on Article 43 of the Hague Regulations and relevant domestic laws. Hague Regulations, Article 43 (**CLA-062**) reads as follows: \"The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.\"\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 332-333 (**CLA-282**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 333 (**CLA-282**).\n\n433.\n\nIn the period after 1945, two new developments set in, each of them with different effects. First, the question of whether an occupation measure complied with international law became more important for legislation and regulatory actions by States. This is reflected in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 (\"**Fourth Geneva Convention**\" or \"**GC IV**\").588 Its Article 146 obliges States parties to enact legislation that penalizes \"grave breaches\" of the convention and \"to take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts\" that violate the convention but do not constitute grave breaches. Secondly, both international human rights law and domestic constitutional law increased the protection of individuals, including regarding their reliance in good faith on measures of the occupant that may have been in breach of the law of occupation.589 Given that the alleged sales by the Soviet military to private parties occurred in the early 1990s (or in 1989, as partly stated by the Claimant), it is the law that developed after World War II that is relevant here.\n\n*See* Eyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 333-334 (**CLA-282**), but who cites Article 147 GC IV (and not Article 146 GV IV) that defines \"grave breaches\".\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 333-334 (**CLA-282**).\n\n434.\n\nFrom his analysis of pertinent State practice and judicial decisions, Benvenisti deduces several factors that matter and must be balanced when determining the lawfulness of a measure of the returning government that conflicts with an act of the occupant. First, the graver the harm to the interests protected by the relevant primary norm, the more likely it is that reversing the measure is lawful, especially if that measure constituted a *jus cogens* violation.590 Secondly, the good faith of an individual who benefited from the consequences of a breach of a primary norm is a necessary condition for upholding a claim of that individual.591 Thirdly, the weight to be accorded to the legitimate expectations of individuals who\u2014in good faith\u2014have relied on occupation measures increases over time, especially if the reversing measures occur generations later.592 Fourthly, the \"forward-looking wish\" of the returning government to provide for a \"smooth and effective\" transition after the occupation matters in the balancing process.593 Finally, the relevant States must be accorded a wide margin of appreciation concerning the consequences of an occupation and, therefore, in balancing conflicting claims.594\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 342-343 (**CLA-282**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 343 (**CLA-282**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 344-345 (**CLA-282**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 345-346 (**CLA-282**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 346-347 (**CLA-282**).\n\n435.\n\nRegarding the *first* factor, the gravity of the breach, the Tribunal notes that the M\u00e4lksoo Report states that Estonia was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union following an act of aggression in 1940.595 Moreover, according to the M\u00e4lksoo Report, acts of aggression were outlawed not only in 1945 with Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, but\u2014to the extent relevant here\u2014by the 1930s, because of the Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928, the Litvinov Protocol of 1929, and the (regional) Convention for the Definition of Aggression of 1933.596 The Tribunal considers acts of aggression to constitute violations of *jus cogens*. But for the present case, the Tribunal needs to decide neither whether the Soviet Union's acts in 1940 constituted an aggression, nor whether that potential aggression violated a *jus cogens* norm, which might involve issues of inter-temporal law. Nor is it relevant for the Tribunal's decision whether an aggressor enjoys the same rights under the law of occupation as an occupant \"unguilty\" of an act of aggression for the following reason.\n\nM\u00e4lksoo Report, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 18, 26 (**RER-3**).\n\nM\u00e4lksoo Report, \u00b6 19 (**RER-3**).\n\n436.\n\nBy reference to Benvenisti, the M\u00e4lksoo Report states that the law of occupation did not create any rights for the Soviet Union under that law because the occupation was a result of an aggression and thus illegal.597 The relevant passage of Benvenisti's work, however, does not sustain the proposition that the Claimant's subsidiaries could by definition not acquire title in the relevant assets if the Soviet Union was an illegal occupant. For Benvenisti writes that the returning government is in principle entitled to reverse attempts by an illegal occupant to alienate territory, but only subject to individual rights acquired in good faith.598 In this regard, Benvenisti explicitly refers to the chapter that contains the principles set out in para. 434 above. This means that if the potential acquisition of property by individuals in good faith is involved, the reversal of an illegal occupant's measures is lawful under the requirements addressed here. Therefore, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to decide whether the Soviet Union committed acts of aggression in 1940 and whether it illegally occupied Estonia.\n\n*See* M\u00e4lksoo Report, \u00b6 21 (**RER-3**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 154-155 (**CLA-282**).\n\n437.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal wishes to clarify that deciding the present case does not require a finding whether *jus cogens* norms were violated. *Jus cogens* norms are, for example, those on the prohibition of aggression, slavery, torture, and genocide. The deprivation of public or private property does not fall under this category, as rightly noted by the Claimant.599 The Tribunal will address the issue of whether the alleged sales by the Soviet military to private parties were compatible with the Hague Regulations (under the assumption that Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union) below. At this point of the analysis, it suffices to note that the gravity of such a potential breach of a primary norm of the law of occupation by the Soviet Union does not speak decisively for or against the lawfulness of Estonia's measures.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1119.\n\n438.\n\nThe reversal of a measure that is incompatible with the law of occupation may be unlawful itself if it violates the good faith expectations of the inhabitants of the occupied territory. For, as Benvenisti writes, persons who reside in an occupied territory are entitled to rely in their transactions on the legal system in force in that territory.600 The rationale underlying this principle is that those persons have no choice but to live and work within the domestic legal system that governs everyday matters and commerce. This means that transactions that ought to be upheld regardless of the occupier's compliance with the law of occupation must have been valid under the prevailing local law.601 Here, this local law can only be Soviet law or Estonian law. Both legal regimes will be addressed by the Tribunal as part of its analysis.\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 344 (**CLA-282**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 344 (**CLA-282**).\n\n439.\n\nIndividual rights acquired in good faith carry especially much weight in the balancing process if a long period of time has passed between the relevant acts of the occupant and the measures of the returning government that seek to reverse those acts or their consequences. In Benvenisti's view, this is certainly the case if the reversing measures occur \"generations later\" than the relevant acts of the occupant.602 In this context, Benvenisti refers to case law by the ECtHR in which succeeding generations were affected after \"several decades\".603\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 345 (**CLA-282**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 345 (**CLA-282**).\n\n440.\n\nIn the present case, the Parties agree that the occupation ended in 1994, and that Estonia initiated litigation to reclaim the Seaplane Harbor in 1997 based on legislation enacted from 1990 onwards604. The entities that became the Claimant's subsidiaries in 1999 acquired the relevant assets in 1997 and 1992,605 after the alleged sales by the Soviet military to other private parties in 1990 and 1991.606\n\nResolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia regarding the Initial Measures for Organising the Privatization Process, 17 July 1990 (**CLA-195**).\n\nContract of Purchase and Sales and Pledge Contract between Agrin and B&E, 26 September 1997 (**C-020**); Sale Agreement between Nautex and Verest, Protocols of Transfer, 7 May 1992 (**R-052**).\n\nContract No. 16 (**C-023 / R-036**); Resolution by the Deputy to the Commander of the Soviet Naval Forces for Construction, Engineering Support and Housing, 29 July 1991 (**R-042**); Resolution of Military Unit 13016, 29 July 1991 (**R-043**).\n\n441.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal is not convinced that the time factor would add much, if any, weight to possible good faith expectations, which are necessary to consider Estonia's reversal of occupation measures unlawful and will be addressed in the domestic law section below.\n\n442.\n\nBenvenisti states that an additional factor that plays a role in the balancing process is the returning government's \"forward looking wish to ensure a smooth and effective post-conflict transitional process.\"607 This seems to be a consideration that speaks, at first sight, in favor of the lawfulness of Estonia's measures, given that Estonia had stated throughout the early 1990s that it became illegally occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and wished to reinstate the status quo ante. But the scenarios mentioned by Benvenisti are very different, namely the possible return of refugees to the places they inhabited prior to the occupation. In this regard, Benvenisti considers policies that seek to prevent inter-ethnic violence by requiring returning refugees to live in different parts of the country prior to their expulsion not per se unlawful.608\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 345-346 (**CLA-282**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 346 (**CLA-282**).\n\n443.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that under the circumstances of the present case, Estonia's interest in a smooth transition does not add much to the margin of appreciation that it enjoys anyway, as set out next.\n\n444.\n\nThe final factor to be considered is the wide margin of appreciation that international law accords to States when it comes to the regulation of their post-occupation phase. This margin of appreciation applies to bilateral or multilateral instruments (in the form of peace agreements) and to domestic legislative or regulatory acts of the formerly occupied State.609 Regarding the domestic level, Benvenisti notes that the ECtHR granted Germany a wide margin of appreciation in overhauling the economic system in the new federal states as part of the unification process.610\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 346-347 (**CLA-282**).\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 347 (**CLA-282**).\n\n445.\n\nThe way in which Estonia exercised its margin of appreciation in the 1990s will be examined below in the context of the Estonian legal framework during the transition phase. But before turning to domestic law, the Tribunal will analyze the relevant primary norms of the law of occupation and set out the role of the *ex factis* rule for the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n*(2.) The Primary Norms*\n------------------------\n\n446.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Tribunal assumes in its analysis of the law of occupation that Estonia was indeed occupied by the Soviet Union, as argued by the Claimant in its Memorial but doubted \u2014though not explicitly disputed\u2014in its Reply, and as argued by the Respondent throughout. The alleged sales by the Soviet military to private parties occurred roughly 50 years after the entering into force of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. The Tribunal must therefore analyze whether the Fourth Geneva Convention or the older Hague Regulations apply to those sales. According to the *lex posterior* principle, it would seem logical that the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention on private and public property govern the relevant issues here.\n\n447.\n\nIn this regard, Article 53 GC IV prohibits the destruction of private or public property by the occupying power, but it does not mention any other acts with respect to that property. The scope of Article 147 GC IV is broader. It lists the \"extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly\" as \"grave breaches\" of the convention. But given that Article 53 GC IV merely prohibits the destruction of property, it might be argued that all appropriations of property that fall short of constituting a grave breach of the convention be lawful. But this is not the status of the modern law of occupation, and it was not argued by any of the Parties. Rather, the prohibitions under Articles 53 and 55 of the Hague Regulations continue to apply, and Articles 53 and 147 GC IV must be read in conjunction with those provisions,611 to which the Tribunal turns now.\n\nAnic\u00e9e Van Engeland, 'Protection of Public Property', in Andrew Clapham, Paola Gaeta, and Marco Sass\u00f2li (eds), *The 1949 Geneva Conventions: A commentary*, (OUP, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 2, 43 (**CLA-151**); Geneva Convention IV, Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, 12 August 1949 (ICRC Commentary ed. 1958), Introduction, p. 9 (**CLA-286**).\n\n448.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Soviet military was entitled to sell the buildings and the structures at the Seaplane Harbor to private parties under Article 53 of the Hague Regulations. This provision reads as follows.\n\nAny army of occupation can only take possession of cash, funds, and realizable securities which are strictly the property of the State, depots of arms, means of transport, stores and supplies, and generally, all movable property belonging to the State which may be used for military operations.\n\nAll appliances, whether on land, at sea, or in the air, adapted for the transmission of news, or for the transport of persons or things, exclusive of cases governed by naval law, depots of arms, and, generally, all kinds of ammunition of war, may be seized, even if they belong to private individuals, but must be restored and compensation fixed when peace is made.612\n\nHague Regulations, Article 53 (emphasis added) (**CLA-062**).\n\n449.\n\nMr. Keres opines that at the time of the alleged transfer, buildings constituted \"movables\" under Estonian law, and it was therefore possible that the buildings and the land on which they stood belonged to different owners. More specifically, Mr. Keres states:\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 13 (1) of Law of Property Act Implementation Act (the (\"LPAIA\"), until the entry of land in the land register, a construction erected on a legal basis, including an unfinished construction, was not an essential part of the land and was deemed a movable unless otherwise provided by law. Under \u00a7 13 (3) LPAIA, an owner of a construction had the right to become the owner of the land under that construction as per the procedure set out in the Land Reform Act.613\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 41 (**CER-2**) *referring* to LPAIA (**CLA-189**).\n\n450.\n\nAs a movable \"means of transport\" within the meaning of Article 53 of the Hague Regulations, the Soviet military could, according to the Claimant, use, deplete, and dispose of the buildings and structures at the Seaplane Harbor facilities during the occupation.614\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 284, 296-297.\n\n451.\n\nThe Claimant does not seem to doubt that Article 53 of the Hague Regulations applies only to movable property and Article 55 to immovables.615 As Yoram Dinstein notes, the extent to which the occupant may use public property hinges precisely on the distinction between movables and immovables, and the subsequent application of either Article 53 or 55.616 The Tribunal doubts that the treatment of buildings as movable property under Estonian law for a few years in the 1990s should inform the construction of the Hague Regulations, a multilateral treaty from 1907.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 284-286.\n\nYoram Dinstein, *The International Law of Belligerent Occupation*, (CUP, 2009), p. 213, \u00b6 502 (**RLA-047**).\n\n452.\n\nRather, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Article 53 of the Hague Regulations is not applicable here because the buildings and structures at the Seaplane Harbor constitute immovable property. The latter is governed by Article 55, and the Tribunal has no doubt that the relevant assets at the Seaplane Harbor fall under that provision. The *UK Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict* lists the following assets under the heading \"military lands and buildings\": \"supply depots, arsenals, dockyards, and barracks, as well as airfields, ports, railways, canals, bridges, piers, and their associated installations.\"617 Similarly, Dinstein lists \"airfields, naval dockyards, military barracks\"618 as examples of immovable property subject to Article 55. By contrast, movables under Article 53 are exemplified by means of transport such as \"ships in port\"619 and as \"bicycles, cars and railroad rolling stock to ships and aircraft [and] even ambulances.\"620 The Tribunal has therefore no doubt that the buildings and structures at the Seaplane Harbor, as well as the Seaplane Harbor itself, constitute immovable property under the Hague Regulations.\n\nUK Ministry of Defense, *The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict*, (OUP, 2004), p. 303, \u00b6 11.85 (**CLA-153**) (emphasis added).\n\nYoram Dinstein, *The International Law of Belligerent Occupation*, (CUP, 2009), p. 213, \u00b6 503 (**RLA-047**) (emphasis added).\n\nUK Ministry of Defense, *The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict*, (OUP, 2004), p. 301, \u00b6 11.81.1 (**CLA-153**).\n\nYoram Dinstein, *The International Law of Belligerent Occupation*, (CUP, 2009), pp. 218-219, \u00b6 515 (**RLA-047**) (emphasis added).\n\n453.\n\nFurthermore, even if the Tribunal were to consider the relevant assets to constitute movable property, this would not automatically mean that the Soviet military could validly transfer ownership of those assets to private parties. The scope of Article 53 of the Hague Regulations and the powers of the occupant under this provision are subject to scholarly debate. Some argue that the occupant may only use movable property for military purposes, while others contend that the occupant may also sell it to sustain the occupation and take care of the local population.621 But no one seems to argue that Article 53 of the Hague Regulations grants the occupant an unfettered right to sell property belonging to the occupied state for whatever purpose it deems fit. The Tribunal finds it reasonable to require that acts covered by Article 53 must be taken for military purposes, to cover the costs of the occupation, or for the well-being of the local population.622 The Tribunal is not persuaded that the transactions at issue here served one of those purposes. Finally, the Tribunal notes that the wording of both paragraphs of Article 53 seems to indicate that this provision does not entitle the occupant to transfer title in assets belonging to the occupied State to others.623 Under Article 53(1), the occupant can \"take possession\" of certain assets, but this does not make it the owner of those assets. And Article 53(2) provides that the assets \"must be restored and compensation fixed when peace is made.\"624\n\nAnic\u00e9e Van Engeland, 'Protection of Public Property', in Andrew Clapham, Paola Gaeta, and Marco Sass\u00f2li (eds), *The 1949 Geneva Conventions: A commentary*, (OUP, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 33-34 (**CLA-151**); Dieter Fleck (ed), *The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law*, (OUP, 2013), p. 292, \u00b6 557 (**RLA-048**); Yoram Dinstein, *The International Law of Belligerent Occupation*, (CUP, 2009), p. 219, \u00b6 517 (**RLA-047**); UK Ministry of Defense, *The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict*, (OUP, 2004), pp. 301, 304, \u00b6\u00b6 11.81, 11.88 (**CLA-153**).\n\n*See* Antonio Cassese, 'Powers and Duties of an Occupant in Relation to Land and Natural Resources', in Antonio Cassese, Paola Gaeta, and Salvatore Zappal\u00e0 (eds), *The Human Dimension of International Law: Selected Papers of Antonio Cassese*, (OUP, 2008), p. 422 (**CLA-155**), who applies these requirements to the following acts of the occupant: \"requisitioning private property\", \"seizing public movables\", and \"using state-owned immovables\" (id.) (emphasis added).\n\n*See also* Anic\u00e9e Van Engeland, 'Protection of Public Property', in Andrew Clapham, Paola Gaeta, and Marco Sass\u00f2li (eds), *The 1949 Geneva Conventions: A commentary*, (OUP, 2018), \u00b6\u00b6 33-34 (**CLA-151**); UK Ministry of Defense, *The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict*, (OUP, 2004), p. 301, \u00b6 11.81 (**CLA-153**)\n\n*See also* Eyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 87-88 (**CLA-282**).\n\n454.\n\nAfter having found that Article 53 of the Hague Regulations did not provide the Soviet military with the right to transfer title in the buildings and structures at the Seaplane Harbor to private parties, the Tribunal will now turn to Article 55 of the Hague Regulations, which states that:\n\nThe occupying State shall be regarded only as administrator and usufructuary of public buildings, real estate, forests, and agricultural estates belonging to the hostile State, and situated in the occupied country. It must safeguard the capital of these properties, and administer them in accordance with the rules of usufruct.\n\n455.\n\nThe Claimant posits that in the context of prolonged occupation, Article 55 of the Hague Regulations does not constrain the authority of the occupant in using public property for the purpose of satisfying the needs of the people under occupation.625 This statement seems broadly correct, but it needs to be put into context. Occupants are not only entitled but obliged to administer the occupied territory. In exercising their rights and duties under international law, occupants can also regulate and interfere with economic activities in the occupied territory. Regarding the use of state-owned immovables (governed by Article 55 of the Hague Regulations), the Tribunal considers the relevant principles to be aptly summarized by Antonio Cassese,626 relied on by the Claimant as well. Cassese states that the occupant may use public immovable property only for the following three purposes: (i) to meet its own military or security needs; (ii) to cover the costs involved in the occupation; and (iii) to protect the interests and well-being of the population living on the occupied territory. These are \"very strict limitations\" on the power of the occupant, in the view of Cassese, but they are borne out by State practice. Cassese clarifies that using state-owned immovables for any other purposes is strictly forbidden, for example, if the occupant acts for the benefit of its own population or its national economy.627\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 289-293, 295, 298-301, *referring to* Eyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation* (OUP, 2015), pp. 81-82 (**CLA-204**); Opinion of Advocate General in Western Sahara Case C-266/16, \u00b6 268 (**CLA-147**); Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1055-1057. *See also* Kristen E.

Rather, it seems that those sales occurred for the personal gain of individual officers, as will be outlined below in the domestic law section. But in the end, the purpose of the sales by the Soviet military does not play a decisive role in the Tribunal's analysis. This is because even if the actions had occurred for a legitimate purpose, the occupant could sell only the fruits of the immovable property, and not appropriate or sell the immovable property itself. This understanding of Article 55 of the Hague Regulations seems to be widely accepted in legal scholarship.628 Moreover, in the view of the Tribunal, it is the only construction of this provision that is compatible with its wording, according to which the occupant acts \"only as administrator and usufructuary\".\n\nEyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 88(**CLA-282**); M\u00e4lksoo Report, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36 (**RER-3**); Dieter Fleck (ed), *The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law*, (OUP, 2013), pp. 292-293, \u00b6 558 (**RLA-048**); Yoram Dinstein, *The International Law of Belligerent Occupation*, (CUP, 2009), pp. 213-215, \u00b6\u00b6 504-507 (**RLA-047**); Anic\u00e9e Van Engeland, 'Protection of Public Property', in Andrew Clapham, Paola Gaeta, and Marco Sass\u00f2li (eds), *The 1949 Geneva Conventions: A commentary*, (OUP, 2018), \u00b6 19 (**CLA-151**).\n\n457.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that the sale of the buildings and structures at the Seaplane Harbor by the Soviet military to private parties was not in line with the law of occupation.\n\n458.\n\nThis alone, however, says little about the validity of those sales, or about the rights that the Claimant's subsidiaries may have acquired because of subsequent transactions. As set out above, the primary norms of the law of occupation do not address these issues. Rather, the Tribunal must establish whether the relevant rights were acquired in good faith, that is, in accordance with the local law applicable at the time. If this is the case, then the good faith of the Claimant's subsidiaries speaks against the lawfulness of Estonia's (judicial) acts that reversed the effects of the underlying transactions. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that even if the Soviet military had had the right to sell the relevant assets under the law of occupation, this would not mean that the reversal of the effects of those sales was automatically unlawful. But if there had been no breach of a primary norm, any good faith reliance on the local law would\u2014in the Tribunal's view\u2014be hard, if not impossible, to be outweighed in the balancing process.\n\n459.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis of the relevant local law will be redundant, however, if the Claimant's understanding of the *ex factis* rule is correct, to which the Tribunal turns now.\n\n*(C.) The* Ex Factis *Rule*\n---------------------------\n\n460.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, its subsidiaries became\u2014or are to be treated as\u2014the owners of the Seaplane Harbor because of the *ex factis* rule, irrespective of whether the relevant sales complied with the law of occupation or domestic law.629 Regarding the content of this rule, the source most frequently referred to by the Claimant is a monograph of Lauri Malksoo,630 the Respondent's expert (whom the Claimant chose not to cross-examine at the hearing). In particular, the Claimant relies on parts of a passage in which M\u00e4lksoo argues that, while the annexation in 1940 and the imposition of the Soviet economic system on Estonia violated international law, the same is not true for all acts taken under this system. The part quoted by the Claimant reads as follows.\n\nFor instance, by imposing the Soviet economic system on the Baltic States, the USSR clearly violated the 1907 Hague rules of occupation. However, it is reasonable to argue that the principle [of] *ex factis ius oritur* compels acceptance of certain aspects of the foreign-imposed Soviet economic system in the decades following the illegal annexation as facts of life. The whole Soviet occupation period cannot be regarded as a legal *nullum*. Thus, the foreign-imposed Soviet economic system in the whole Eastern Europe became a fact of life which was ultimately borne by the local population and as such was accepted by the international community. Since it was no longer legally questioned, neither internationally nor domestically, it would be artificial to maintain that this system continued to violate the 1907 Hague Regulations.631\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; 1123; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 45:23 \u2013 p. 48:12, Day 5, p. 57:5-8; Claimant's Answers to Tribunal Question, \u00b6 74.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 87-88, 1066, 1074, 1081; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 45:16 \u2013 p. 46:8, Day 5, p. 57:9-14.\n\nLauri M\u00e4lksoo, *Soviet Annexation and State Continuity: International Legal Status, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940-1991 and after 1991, Investigating the Conflict Between Normativity and Force in International Law*, (Tartu University Press, 2003), (**CLA-291**), p. 194; *cited* by the Claimant in Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1081 and 1110.\n\n461.\n\nM\u00e4lksoo thus warns against considering the acts resulting from the Soviet economic systems to be unlawful only because its introduction in Estonia violated the law of occupation. But M\u00e4lksoo does not argue that the law of occupation became irrelevant for acts on Estonian territory that occurred after the establishment of the Soviet system. Nor does he posit that all transactions made under the economic regime in place at the time were valid as a matter of international law regardless of their compliance with the relevant domestic rules.\n\n462.\n\nNothing different follows from the concept of the \"*normative Kraft des Faktischen*.\" This term was coined by Georg Jellinek, and as the Claimant rightly stresses, M\u00e4lksoo repeatedly refers to it in the context of the *ex factis* rule. M\u00e4lksoo uses it regarding the issue whether Estonia continued to exist as a State between 1940 and the 1990s or whether its statehood had ended following the events\u2014or, in M\u00e4lksoo's words, the Soviet aggression\u2014of 1940. Some authors point out that the Soviet annexation, spanning half a century, lasted twice as long as Estonia's independence until 1940. Given that Estonia could not exercise any powers of a State (*Staatsgewalt*) during that time, those authors consider the continued existence of Estonia from 1940 until its independence an unsustainable fiction.632 M\u00e4lksoo rejects this view, stating that:\n\nThat the international legal system may appear to be uncapable of answering violations of one of its most fundamental norms\u2014the prohibition of aggression\u2014should be a bigger problem for lawyers who worry about the relevance of the rule of law in international relations, than the fear that international law would become 'irrealistic' when supporting legal fictions when fundamental legal norms have been violated. In any case, the so-called normative Kraft des Faktischen cannot have a legal significance (Kraft) of its own.633\n\nLauri M\u00e4lksoo, *Soviet Annexation and State Continuity: International Legal Status, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940-1991 and after 1991, Investigating the Conflict Between Normativity and Force in International Law*, (Tartu University Press, 2003), (**CLA-291**), pp. 74-75 (fn. 113), p. 111 (\"Georg Dahm argued that protests and formal non-recognition cannot prevent prescription from taking place; rather the source of the prescription is the normative Kraft des Faktischen itself.\")\n\nLauri M\u00e4lksoo, *Soviet Annexation and State Continuity: International Legal Status, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940-1991 and after 1991, Investigating the Conflict Between Normativity and Force in International Law*, (Tartu University Press, 2003), (**CLA-291**), pp. 201-202.\n\n463.\n\nM\u00e4lksoo concludes his monograph with the observations that\u2014based on the principle of *ex injuria jus non oritur*\u2014the international community has come to accept that illegally annexed States do not become extinct as subjects of international law. But complete adherence to this principle would have required the total restoration of all legal relations, rights, and duties of Estonia from the pre-annexation phase.634 That this proved impossible is, according to M\u00e4lksoo, evidence of the *ex factis* principle, which in his view does not undermine the proposition that the Baltic States continued to exist throughout their occupation.635 But nothing in M\u00e4lksoo's monograph suggests that transactions must be upheld regardless of their compliance with the local law that was in place at the time the transactions occurred because of the *ex factis* principle.\n\nLauri M\u00e4lksoo, *Soviet Annexation and State Continuity: International Legal Status, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940-1991 and after 1991, Investigating the Conflict Between Normativity and Force in International Law*, (Tartu University Press, 2003), (**CLA-291**), p. 324.\n\nLauri M\u00e4lksoo, *Soviet Annexation and State Continuity: International Legal Status, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940-1991 and after 1991, Investigating the Conflict Between Normativity and Force in International Law*, (Tartu University Press, 2003), (**CLA-291**), pp. 326-327.\n\n464.\n\nAnother author on which the Claimant relies in the context of its arguments regarding the *ex factis* rule and legal certainty is Benvenisti. In this regard, the Claimant refers to the passages of Benvenisti outlined above, namely that good faith reliance of individuals on local law may require that acts taken in breach of the law of occupation remain valid.636 The Tribunal agrees with this proposition. It is the basis of its analysis here. Particularly clear for present purposes is the following statement of Benvenisti, quoted by the Claimant:\n\n[I]n principle it is suggested that individuals who reside in an occupied territory are entitled to rely in their private transactions on the legal system actually in force in the country (a system which they themselves were not responsible for creating), and develop expectations based on the regular norms that system has produced.637\n\n*See, e.g.* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1070, 1073, 1099, *referring* to Eyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), pp. 343-346 (**CLA-282**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1114; 1099; Eyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 344 (**CLA- 282**).\n\n465.\n\nThe cases, instruments, and other authorities cited by the Claimant either confirm that acquirers must have relied in good faith on the local law in place at the time to consider the restitution of property to original owners unlawful, or they say nothing that warrants a different conclusion. The Claimant quotes, for example, from a passage by Benvenisti in which the latter addresses the German unification. The unification treaty recognized the right of restoration of property expropriated by the authorities of the German Democratic Republic (\"**GDR**\") after 1949. But there were exceptions to this rule. A third person who had acquired the relevant property would be allowed to keep it unless the acquisition did not comply with the law or regulatory practice of the GDR, and the acquirer knew or should have known this.638\n\n*See, e.g.* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1070, 1073, 1099, *referring* to Eyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 344 (**CLA-282**).\n\n466.\n\nCases referred to by the Claimant in which the relevant measures complied with local law include *In re P. (Komotini Case)*, where a Greek Court upheld a will administered in accordance with the legal system imposed by the Bulgarian occupant.639 Another example in this regard is the case *Hungarian Soviet Government (Confiscation of Property)*, decided by the Austrian Supreme Court in the early 1920s. The court upheld the sale of a bank confiscated by the government of the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic of 1919 to a Viennese merchant because the sale occurred in compliance with the decrees of that government.640\n\n*In re P. (Komotini Case)*, 15 ILR 566, \u00b6\u00b6 566 \u2013 567 (**CLA-303**), *quoted* in Reply, \u00b6 1087.\n\nHungarian Soviet Government (Confiscation of Property) Case, 1 ILR 56 (Austria, Supreme Court of Civil Matters, 1922), \u00b6\u00b6 56 -7 (**CLA-300**), *referred to* in the Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1089 \u2013 1090.\n\n467.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (\"**ICJ**\") Advisory Opinion in *Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970)*, supports the findings set out above as well. As stated in Security Council Resolution 276, the continued application and enforcement of South African law in Namibia violated international law. But this did not mean, in the words of the ICJ, that \"acts, such as, for instance, the registration of births, deaths and marriages, the effects of which can be ignored only to the detriment of the inhabitants of the Territory\" were invalid.641 In his separate opinion, Judge Hardy Dillard further elaborated on these words, emphasizing that \"[a]s Lauterpacht has indicated the maxim *ex injuria jus non oritur* is not so severe as to deny that any source of right whatever can accrue to third persons acting in good faith.\"642\n\nICJ Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971, \"Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South-West Africa) Notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970)\", \u00b6 125 (**CLA-160**); *quoted* in Reply, \u00b6 1121.\n\nSeparate Opinion of Judge Hardy Dillard, ICJ Advisory Opinion on Namibia ICJ, GL No 53, [1971], p. 167 (**CLA-161**).\n\n468.\n\nIn its *Opinion on the Law on Occupied Territories of Georgia*, the Venice Commission stressed both the freedom of States to not recognize the acts of foreign powers in their legal order, but also the need to protect individuals who acquired property based on those acts. Regarding the first point, the Commission stated that \"each State is free to recognize or not to recognize acts of state issued by other States or by de facto authorities [\u2026]. On the basis of international customary law there is no obligation to recognize such acts.\"643 With a view to the second point, the protection of individuals, the Commission added that \"this freedom ends where basic human rights would be violated\".644 In this regard, the commission clarified that \"[i]f a person acquired a property on the basis of an act [\u2026] at a time when the law permitted such an acquisition, the annulment of the acquisition act after a long period of time and without any compensation may represent a violation of the right to peaceful enjoyment of one's possession\".645\n\nVenice Commission, Opinion No. 516/2009 (March 17, 2009), CDL-AD(2009)015, \u00b6 43 (**CLA-166**).\n\nVenice Commission, Opinion No. 516/2009 (March 17, 2009), CDL-AD(2009)015, \u00b6 43 (**CLA-166**).\n\nVenice Commission, Opinion No. 516/2009 (March 17, 2009), CDL-AD(2009)015, \u00b6 24 (**CLA-166**).\n\n469.\n\nIn sum, the authorities cited by the Claimant regarding the *de factis* rule support the finding of the Tribunal that the Claimant's subsidiaries may have acquired ownership in the relevant assets only if they relied in good faith on the validity of those transactions under the applicable local law. The Tribunal turns to this question now.\n\n*(III.) Domestic Law*\n---------------------\n\n470.\n\nIf the Soviet Union occupied Estonia until the early 1990s, the Tribunal should\u2014under the methodology set out above\u2014consider whether the relevant transactions were valid under the applicable domestic law, usually referred to as local law in the law of occupation.646 In this subsection, the Tribunal will use the more generic term domestic law because Soviet law and Estonian law are relevant not only if the law of occupation applies but also under two alternative views. The first of these views considers the law of occupation to apply only if the period of foreign control is rather short, unlike in Estonia, where that period exceeded 50 years.647 The second view posits that Estonia seceded from the Soviet Union in the early 1990s after it had joined the Soviet Union (voluntarily) in 1940.648 It seems obvious to the Tribunal that under those alternative views, the only legal regimes that could possibly govern the transactions at issue here are Soviet law and Estonian law.\n\n*See, e.g. supra* \u00b6 438. The use of the term local law as opposed to domestic law in the context of the law of occupation is related to the rights and obligations of the occupant. Occupants are obliged to ensure public order and safety, which is, for example, recognized in Article 43 of the Hague Regulations. This provision reads as follows: \"The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country\". Occupants are entitled to enact rules in fulfillment of this obligation. They may also impose rules or entirely new legal system for other reasons, whether lawful or not. The term local law stresses that any rules enacted by the occupant are not necessarily identical to the domestic law in place at the occupying State or to the domestic law that applied in the occupied territory prior to the occupation.\n\n*See, e.g*., the reference provided in Lauri M\u00e4lksoo, *Soviet Annexation and State Continuity: International Legal Status, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940-1991 and after 1991, Investigating the Conflict Between Normativity and Force in International Law*, (Tartu University Press, 2003), (**CLA-291**), pp. 74-75 (fn. 113).\n\nSee *supra* \u00b6 429.\n\n*(A.) Soviet Law*\n-----------------\n\n471.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the sales of the Soviet military to private parties were unlawful under the law of occupation, which is why their compliance with Soviet law does not matter.649 As set out above, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the sales by the Soviet military were void and without legal effects only because the Soviet Union may have breached the Hague Regulations. In addition, the Respondent posits that those sales were, in any event, illegal under Soviet law.650\n\nThe Claimant states that Soviet law is irrelevant because, under the law of occupation, Estonia must accept the sales by the Soviet military as a historical fact.651 The Tribunal has dealt with this argument above. In the present case, the law of occupation mandates the Tribunal's consideration of the local law in place when the transactions occurred, and the *de factis* rule provides nothing different.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 140.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 93; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 141-144.\n\nReply, \u00b6 23.\n\n472.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it possible that Soviet law is part of the relevant analysis. For as will be outlined in this subsection, all sales by the Soviet military relied on by the Claimant occurred before 6 September 1991, the day until which\u2014 according to the Petrachkov Report, to which the Claimant did not respond\u2014the constitution of the Soviet Union (\"**USSR Constitution\"**) applied in Estonia.652 Also, on 6 September 1991, the State Council of the Soviet Union recognized the independence of Estonia, shortly after the Supreme Council of Estonia had announced Estonia's full independence from the USSR on 20 August 1991.653\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 23 (**RER-2**).\n\n*Supra* \u00b6 167; Petrachkov Report, \u00b6 23 (**RER-2**).\n\n473.\n\nThe Hangar and the berths at the Seaplane Harbor were allegedly transferred from the Soviet military to GT, a private company before 20 August 1991. Because documents underlying or related to the alleged sales are partly contradictory and others are missing, the Respondent alleges that several documents on file are forged.654 The Tribunal will return to this point later if necessary. For its analysis here, it suffices to note that on 31 July 1991, two protocols of transfer regarding the Hangar and the relevant berths were signed between military unit 10717 and 1176 UNR.655 While the Respondent states that both entities were military units, the Petrachkov Report confirms this with respect to Military unit 10717, but clarifies that UNR 1176 was a state organization subordinated to the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union.656 On 17 August 1991, 1176 UNR allegedly sold the Hangar and the berths to GT, which transferred those assets on the same day to Nautex, another private company (which in turn, on 7 May 1992, sold them to Verest, acquired by the Claimant's subsidiary BPV in 1999).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 118-132.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 121.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 121; Petrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 159-160, 168 (**RER-2**).\n\n474.\n\nThe lumber works at the Seaplane Harbor were, according to the Claimant, transferred by the Soviet military to a private party, B&E, even earlier than the Hangar and the berths. Many facts regarding the alleged transfer of the lumber works from the Soviet military to the B&E are contested. But if such a transaction occurred, then this happened on 22 May 1990 and/or 1 November 1990.657\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant stated that through Contract No. 16, Military Factory No. 84, one of the joint owners of SEK, agreed to sell all of SEK's port assets to B&E on 22 May 1990. This transfer was \"finalized\", according to the Claimant, through a so-called \"directive\" of SEK dated 1 November 1990 (Claimant's PHB, \u00b6 88). In this directive, the director of SEK \"order[ed]\", firstly, to \"take\" the woodworking buildings and other buildings and structures listed in the directive \"to the balance sheet of small enterprise SEK\", and secondly, to \"transfer\" them to the \"balance sheet\" of B&E (SEK Directive No. 17/90 (**C-024**); Respondent's Translation of Claimant's Exhibit C-024 (**R-035**). On 26 September 1997, B&E allegedly transferred the lumber works to Agrin, which was owned by the Claimant's subsidiary BPV from 8 December 1999 until 22 March 2001.\n\n475.\n\nThis means that the (alleged) sales by the Soviet military to private parties occurred not only while the USSR Constitution still applied in Estonia but also after March 1990. In that month, the Congress of Estonia declared that the Republic of Estonia must be restored based on the principle of State continuity and the Supreme Council of the ESSR proclaimed the \"transitional period.\"658 Hence, in the period in which the relevant sales occurred, the USSR Constitution was still in force in Estonia (according to Soviet law), and Estonia established a transitional legal regime. This may raise certain questions as to the relationship between Soviet law and Estonian law. The Tribunal will revert to this relationship after its analysis of the two legal regimes if they lead to diverging results regarding the questions at issue here.\n\nM\u00e4lksoo Report, \u00b6 41, Annex 4 (**RER-3**); Resolution of the Supreme Council of the ESSR on the National Status of Estonia, 29 March 1990 (**RLA-049**); Lauri M\u00e4lksoo, *Illegal Annexation and State Continuity: The Case of the Incorporation of the Baltic States by the USSR* (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2003), p. 48 (**CLA-291**).\n\n476.\n\nThe sale of the Hangar and the berths on 17 August 1991 from UNR 1176 to the private entity GT was, according to the Petrachkov Report, void under Soviet law.659 The Claimant considers this finding irrelevant without disputing or confirming it. While possibly not strictly necessary under these circumstances, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to analyze whether, in its view, the relevant conclusions of the Petrachkov Report are correct. In this regard, the Tribunal has difficulties in imagining that individual Soviet military units or their commanders could sell at will military equipment, entire military bases, or parts of the real estate thereon to private parties. Having carefully reviewed the Petrachkov Report as well as the legislation and regulations referred to therein, the Tribunal is convinced that this is the proper result under Soviet law.\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 168 (**RER-2**).\n\n477.\n\nUnder Article 74 of the USSR Constitution, the law of the Soviet Union had priority over the law of its individual republics. It clarified that:\n\n[T]he laws of the USSR have equal legal force in the territories of all Union republics. If the law of a Union republic contradicts the law of the USSR, the law of the USSR is to be applied.660\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 36 (**RER-2**) *referring to* Constitution (the fundamental law) of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 7 October 1977 (as amended on 14 March 1990), Article 74 (**SP-12**).\n\n478.\n\nPrivate property did not exist under the USSR Constitution, nor under the Fundamentals of the Civil Legislation of the USSR and Soviet republics (\"**USSR Fundamentals of Civil Legislation**\") which remained in force until 31 December 1991.661 There was individual ownership, but that included only a limited list of relatively insignificant (household) objects that were not allowed to be used for entrepreneurial activity.662 In addition to individual ownership, there was only socialist and collective ownership.663 The latter was partly considered a category of socialist ownership and partly a separate third form of ownership.664 Here, the distinction does not matter. The most important category of socialist ownership was state ownership, and the others included cooperative ownership as well as ownership of labor union organizations and other social organizations.665\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 12(G), 22-58, especially \u00b6\u00b6 49-50 (**RER-2**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49 (**RER-2**) Fundamentals of civil legislation of the USSR and Soviet republics, 8 December 1961 (in force until 31 December 1991), Article 25 (**SP-2**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 123(B) (**RER-2**).\n\nSee Petrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 123(B) (**RER-2**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 58, 123(B) (**RER-2**).\n\n479.\n\nState ownership and the assets that fell under it were described in Article 21 of the USSR Fundamentals of Civil Legislation as follows.\n\n[S]tate ownership is the collective heritage of the Soviet people and the key form of socialist ownership.\n\nThe state is the sole owner of all state property.\n\nLand, its subsoil, waters and woods stay in the exclusive ownership of the state and could be transferred only for use purposes.

Article 13 of the USSR Constitution reads as follows:\n\n[S]tate ownership includes the all-Union ownership, the ownership of Union republics, the ownership of autonomy republics, the ownership of autonomy regions, the ownership of autonomy districts, territories, regions and other geographical administrative divisions.671\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 50-58 (**RER-2**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61 (**RER-2**) *referring to* Constitution (the fundamental law) of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 7 October 1977 (as amended on 14 March 1990), Article 13 (**SP-12**).\n\n482.\n\nAlong the same lines, Article 19(1) of the USSR Ownership Law provided that:\n\n[S]tate ownership comprises all-Union ownership, the ownership of Soviet republics, autonomous republics, regions, districts territorial and administrative division (community ownership). Disposal and operation of the state property are performed by the relevant Councils of People's Deputies and state bodies authorized by them on behalf of the nation (population of the territorial and administrative division).672\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 72 (**RER-2**) *referring to* Law No. 1305-1 \"On ownership in the USSR\", 6 March 1990 (as amended on 24 December 1990), Article 19(1) (**SP-4**).\n\n483.\n\nAssets of the Soviet military were in \"all-Union ownership\". This is reflected in Article 21 of the USSR Ownership Law, which stated (*inter alia*) that:\n\n[T]he following property is in the all-Union ownership: property of state governmental and administrative bodies of the USSR, [\u2026] property of the Soviet Armed Forces, the border, inner and railway forces, defense facilities, the USSR budget funds, State Bank of the USSR and other banks of the USSR and the property of all-Union reserve, insurance and other funds.673\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 76 (**RER-2**) *referring to* Law No. 1305-1 \"On ownership in the USSR\", 6 March 1990 (as amended on 24 December 1990), Article 21 (**SP-4**).\n\n484.\n\nAccording to the Petrachkov Report, the USSR Ownership Law therefore confirms the proposition set out above in paragraph 480 that land and capital assets in \"all-Union ownership,\" such as property of the Soviet military, must remain state-owned.674 For the property of the Soviet military, the Petrachkov Report considers this proposition especially compelling, given the paramount role of the military in the Soviet Union, reflected for example in Article 31 of the USSR Constitution:\n\n[T]he defense of the socialist Motherland is the key function of the state and is a national matter for the entire Soviet people.675\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 100-101 (**RER-2**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 95 (**RER-2**) *referring to* Constitution (the fundamental law) of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, 7 October 1977 (as amended on 14 March 1990), Article 31 (**SP-12**).\n\n485.\n\nThe USSR Ministry of Defense was charged with operating the property of the Soviet military (and any possible transfers of that property to other state entities). As provided by a regulation dated 14 November 1991, the Ministry of Defense continued to perform this function during the transitional period of the USSR, which was dissolved in December 1991.676 Inventory regulations issued by the Minister of Defense confirmed in their first paragraph that land used by the USSR military, barracks, and all fighting and other equipment of the armed forces was state-owned.677\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 102 (**RER-2**) *referring to* Resolution of the State Council of the USSR No. GS-13, 14 November 1991 (**SP-26**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 103-104 (**RER-2**).\n\n486.\n\nIn sum, the Petrachkov Report opines that land and capital assets of the Soviet military, such as buildings, could not be sold to anybody outside the Soviet government and administration as those assets were in \"exclusive state (all-Union) ownership.\"678\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 100, 105(A) (**RER-2**).\n\n487.\n\nIn addition, the Petrachkov Report also sets out under what conditions state property\u2014which includes other assets than land and capital assets in exclusive all-Union ownership\u2014could be transferred, and to what entities. Such transfers were strictly limited by the provisions of the Resolution of the USSR Council of Ministers No. 940 \"On the procedure for the transfer of state enterprises, associations, organizations, institutions, buildings and structures\" of 16 October 1979, as amended on 5 October 1989 (\"**Resolution 940**\").679\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 101 (**RER-2**).\n\n488.\n\nResolution 940 basically provided for two forms of transfers. The first form was transfers on gratuitous grounds that had no impact on the state ownership of the relevant assets because both transferor and transferee were ministries, government departments, state enterprises, or other state entities.680 This form of transfer was, according to the Petrachkov Report, called \"from balance to balance transfer.\"681 The second form included transfers against compensation of buildings and structures by state entities to cooperative and other social organizations that required the approval of the relevant ministry.682\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118 (**RER-2**) *referring to* Resolution of the USSR Council of Ministers No. 940 \"On the procedure for the transfer of state enterprises, associations, organizations, institutions, buildings and structures\", 16 October 1979 (as amended on 5 October 1989), Articles 3, 5 (**SP-10**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 118 (**RER-2**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 119-120 (**RER-2**); Resolution of the USSR Council of Ministers No. 940 \"On the procedure for the transfer of state enterprises, associations, organizations, institutions, buildings and structures\", 16 October 1979 (as amended on 5 October 1989), Articles 7, 8 (**SP-10**).\n\n489.\n\nAccording to Article 14 of the USSR Fundamentals of Civil Legislation, transactions that did not comply with the law were void.683 This included the transfer of assets that were in exclusive state ownership to other than state entities and the lack of mandatory approvals.684\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 133 (**RER-2**) *referring to* Fundamentals of civil legislation of the USSR and Soviet republics, 8 December 1961 (in force until 31 December 1991), Article 14 (**SP-2**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 102 (**RER-2**).\n\n490.\n\nAgainst the legislative and regulatory background set out in paragraphs 477-489 above, the Tribunal shares the conclusion of the Petrachkov Report that the transfer of the buildings and structures from the Soviet military to GT on 17 August 1991 was void under Soviet law. For these assets were in exclusive state\u2014more precisely, \"all-Union\"\u2014ownership and could be transferred only to entities subordinated to the USSR Ministry of Defense, but not to other entities, and surely not to private parties.685 The Petrachkov Report includes several other reasons why GT could not acquire those assets.686 In this regard, the Tribunal wishes to mention only that neither the transaction between Military unit 10717 and 1176 UNR nor the transaction between 1176 UNR and GT seems to have been approved by the USSR Ministry of Defense.687\n\n*See* Petrachkov Report, \u00b6 168 (A)-(B) (**RER-2**).\n\n*See* Petrachkov Report, \u00b6 168 (C)-(E) (**RER-2**).\n\n*See* Petrachkov Report, \u00b6 168 (C) (**RER-2**).\n\n491.\n\nAs regards the transaction in 1990 through which B&E allegedly acquired the buildings and structures that were supposed to serve the lumber operations of the Claimant, the Petrachkov Report includes even more reasons why this transaction was invalid.688 As in the context of GT, the transaction was void because the military assets could not be sold to B&E as a private, non-State entity.689 The only additional ground that the Tribunal wishes to mention here is again the lack of any approval by the USSR Ministry of Defense.690\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6 156 (A)-(G) (**RER-2**).\n\n*See* Petrachkov Report, \u00b6 156 (A) (**RER-2**).\n\n*See* Petrachkov Report, \u00b6 156 (E)-(G) (**RER-2**).\n\n492.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that the possible involvement of SEK in the transfer of the property to B&E is no ground for considering this transaction valid. The Respondent has pointed to inconsistencies in the documentary record regarding the alleged transfer of the relevant assets to B&E in its written submissions. At the Hearing, the Respondent reiterated that the Claimant has never clarified whether B&E acquired the relevant assets from SEK or whether it relies on Contract No. 16 dated 22 May 1990, to which SEK was not a party.691 The Claimant then specified that through Contract No. 16, the parties agreed to sell SEK's port assets to B&E. The transfer was \"finalized\", according to the Claimant, through a so-called \"directive\" of SEK dated 1 November 1990.692 In this directive, the director of SEK \"order[ed]\", firstly, to \"take\" the woodworking buildings and other buildings and structures listed in the directive \"to the balance sheet of small enterprise SEK\", and secondly, to \"transfer\" them to the \"balance sheet\" of B&E.693 The Petrachkov Report explains that an internal act like a directive of SEK cannot have any effects on the relevant assets.694 This sounds plausible but is not decisive for the Tribunal's finding. Rather, the two reasons for the invalidity of the transfer of assets belonging to the Soviet military to B&E set out above \u2014that is, the inalienability of land and capital assets in all-Union ownership and the lack of approval by the Ministry of Defense\u2014remain applicable.695 The Petrachkov Report also sets out that a \"small enterprise\" had autonomy regarding its proceeds and profits. But this does not mean that it was the owner of any assets on its balance sheet.696\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, pp. 107:17-24.\n\nClaimant's PHB, \u00b6 88 *referring to* SEK Directive No. 17/90 (**C-019**).\n\nSEK Directive No. 17/90 (**C-024**); Respondent's Translation of Claimant's Exhibit C-024 (**R-035**). Initially, the Claimant seems to have argued that (the majority of) the relevant assets were transferred to SEK pursuant to Decree No. 477 on 29 December 1989 (Memorial, \u00b6 253, *referring to* Decree 477 establishing SE SEK, 29 December 1989 (**C-018**). But this decree merely established SEK. It does not mention any assets, let alone the transfer of such assets.\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 174-175, 179(E) (**RER-2**).\n\n*See* Petrachkov Report, \u00b6 179(A) & (C) (**RER-2**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 169-172, 179(B)-(D) (**RER-2**).\n\n493.\n\nHaving found\u2014in accordance with the Petrachkov Report\u2014that the relevant transactions were invalid under Soviet law, the Tribunal will now turn to Estonian law.\n\n*(B.) Estonian Law*\n-------------------\n\n494.\n\nAs set out above, the Estonian courts have decided that the transactions by which the Soviet military allegedly transferred the relevant assets at the Seaplane Harbor to private parties were void and that the Claimant's subsidiaries never became the owners of those assets.697 This requires the Tribunal to determine whether and to what extent it may revisit issues under Estonian law on which Estonian courts have already decided. The Tribunal will address this issue first, before it outlines and\u2014within the appropriate bounds\u2014assesses the reasoning of the Estonian courts.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 284-302 above.\n\n*(1.) Level of Scrutiny*\n------------------------\n\n495.\n\nAddressing ownership issues under Estonian law raises the question of how an international tribunal should determine the content of a host State's law. The tribunal in *Emmis v. Hungary* faced a similar task, which it described as follows:\n\nWhere the Tribunal is presented with a question of municipal law essential to the issues raised by the Parties for its decision, the Tribunal, whilst retaining its independent powers of assessment and decision, must seek to determine the content of the applicable law in accordance with evidence presented to it as to the content of the law and the manner in which the law would be understood and applied by the municipal courts.698\n\n*Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2, Award, 16 April 2014, \u00b6 175 (**RLA-059**).\n\n496.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the principle articulated in *Emmis* that the content of a host State's law must be determined based on how the relevant domestic courts would understand and apply that law. The present case is special insofar as the Estonian courts have ruled on the very issue of whether the Claimant's subsidiaries had acquired title to the buildings and structures at the Lennusadam Port. As set out above, they have answered this question in the negative.699 As a tribunal constituted under international law that is supposed to be independent of the Parties, the Tribunal does not consider itself to be bound by these decisions. The States parties to an investment treaty can of course agree that an international tribunal must follow the findings of the domestic courts of the State whose conduct is alleged to be wrongful. But absent such a provision, it seems unlikely that States parties intended an international tribunal to be bound by the decisions of the domestic courts of the respondent State. This is because arbitration clauses are typically included in a treaty if the States parties want disputes to be decided by a neutral third-party adjudicator unrelated to one of the disputing parties.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 284-302 above.\n\n497.\n\nWhile the Tribunal, therefore, cannot simply adopt the decisions of the Estonian courts without making its own assessment, it is also convinced that it would be wrong to second guess and possibly overrule the Estonian courts as if the Tribunal were a court of appeal. In principle, domestic judges are better suited to interpret and apply their domestic law than international tribunals. Hence, the Tribunal has no doubt that Estonia and the U.S. intended a tribunal constituted under the Treaty to grant some deference to the decisions of their domestic courts. The scope of this deference is not necessarily uniform in all contexts. The tribunal in *Azinian v. Mexico*, for example, found that decisions of domestic courts violate the FET standard if they constitute a \"clear and malicious misapplication of the law.\"700 It is debatable whether the same or a similar standard is appropriate here, where the Tribunal must determine an issue regarding its jurisdiction based on domestic law. But defining the precise degree of deference owed to the Estonian courts regarding the Tribunal's jurisdiction is dispensable if the Tribunal does not consider that Estonian law was applied wrongly. The Tribunal will revert to this point later.\n\n*Azinian, Davitian, & Baca v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999, \u00b6 103 (**CLA-087** and **RLA-122**).\n\n*(2.) The Reasoning of the Estonian courts*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n498.\n\nThe Estonian court's decision that neither Agrin nor Verest had become the owners of the buildings and structures at the Port became final in 2006, when the Supreme Court decided not to hear the appeal against the March 2006 Appeal Judgment of the Tallinn Circuit Court. The latter judgment fully endorsed the Tallinn City Court's reasoning regarding ownership, which it did not consider necessary to repeat or amend.701 The Circuit Court disagreed with the city Court's interpretation of statutory provisions on possession, but this issue is relevant regarding the validity of the lease agreements and title-bearing possession and will be analyzed by the Tribunal later.\n\nMarch 2006 Appeal Judgment, p. 38 (**C-081**).\n\n499.\n\nThe City Court clarified that none of the parties disputed that the piece of land on which the buildings and structures were located belonged to the Republic of Estonia, which, according to the court, is confirmed by documentary evidence from the years 1924 to 1941.702 Regarding the ownership of the buildings and structures, the City Court first outlined\u2014by reference to a decision of a Supreme Court decision of 1994, on which more later\u2014the political and legal developments from 1918 until the mid-1990s as. The court stated that after its creation in 1918, the Republic of Estonia was occupied in 1940 and unlawfully integrated into the Soviet Union, which, as the occupant, never owned the real estate in the occupied territory. In the words of the court:\n\nThe Republic of Estonia has been created based on the national right of self-determination of the people of Estonia and proclaimed on 24 February 1918; the Republic of Estonia was occupied and annexed by the USSR in 1940 with the help of its armed forces based on the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement and was incorporated unlawfully to the USSR.; it was illegal according to international law and in contradiction with the interests and goals of the state and the people of Estonia stated in the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia; arising from the superiority of international law the states are obliged to follow the provisions of international law including the provisions of international customary law; Article 55 of the IV Hague Convention states that the occupying country cannot acquire the real estate of the occupied country; it has to maintain the value of the immovable property and can only be the possessor or ususfructur[\u2026]703\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 23, \u00b6 1 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 23, \u00b6 2 (**C-078**).\n\n500.\n\nThe City Court also summarized the Estonian legislative and regulatory steps in the process of regaining full independence, and it stressed that the form and content of the relevant acts were influenced by the political realities (which included the presence of the Soviet military until 1994). In this regard, the court stated inter alia that:\n\n[T]he restoration of the state of Estonia was a process and the scope, legal content and form of the political and legal decisions that were the basis of it has depended on the current opportunities of the forces restoring the state; on 30 March 1990 the ESSR Supreme Court [sic!] as the representative of the people at the time showed the will to restore the independence of the Republic of Estonia and proclaimed the USSR state power in Estonia illegal from the moments of its enacting and proclaimed the restoration of the Republic of Estonia; the 16 May 1990 decision of the Supreme Council stated that the legal system to be created is based on the will of the people of Estonia and the generally acknowledged principles of international law; the 17 July 1990 decision of the Supreme Council suspended the change of the form of ownership of the assets in the ownership of the state [\u2026]704\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 23, \u00b6 2 (**C-078**). While the translation provided by the Claimant erroneously refers to the \"ESSR Supreme Court\" in the passage quoted above, it is undisputed that it was the Supreme Council who issued the March 1990 Resolution (*see also* paragraph 164 above).\n\n501.\n\nAs regards the specific transactions at issue, the City Court found that the transfers of the relevant assets to B&E (the alleged predecessor in title to Agrin) and GT (the alleged predecessor in title to Nautex and then Verest) were in breach of the 17 July 1990 Resolution.705 This resolution suspended all transactions involving State assets until legislation regulating the privatization of ownership was adopted. The alleged transfer of the Hangar and the berths from the USSR Armed Forces to GT took place more than a year after that, namely on 17 August 1991. The alleged transfer of the lumber works to B&E could, according to the City Court, not have taken place before 11 September 1990, the date when SEK was registered.706 The court also noted that it does not matter which (if any) of the two versions of Contract No. 16 dated 22 May 1990 presented to it was the authentic version. This is because SEK\u2014the entity whose assets were supposed to be transferred to B&E under Contract No. 16\u2014took the buildings and structures to its balance sheet only on 1 November 1990. This means that on 22 May 1990, they could not have constituted assets of SEK.707\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, pp. 25-26, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, pp. 25-26, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11 (**C-078**).\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, pp. 25-26, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11 (**C-078**).\n\n502.\n\nIn light of the above, the City Court concluded that GT and B&E did not become owners of the relevant assets because the transactions were in breach of the 17 July 1990 Resolution and thus void according to section 51(1) of the Civil Code.708 The City Court also mentioned and relied on other resolutions and legal instruments in its analysis. To avoid unnecessary repetitions, the Tribunal will address them in the next subsection.\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, pp. 25-26, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11 (**C-078**).\n\n503.\n\nRegarding the alleged successors in title to GT and B&E, including Verest and Agrin, the Tallinn City Court held that none of the subsequent transactions effected a change in ownership by operation of good-faith provisions under Estonian law. This is because the relevant entities knew or should have known that the assets belonged to Estonia. The City Court added that good-faith acquisition is, in any event, impossible under Estonian law if the owner lost the property against their will, which was the case here because of the illegal Soviet annexation.709 Additional details of the reasoning of the Estonian courts will be addressed in the context of the Tribunal's assessment, which follows now.\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 27, \u00b6 15.\n\n*(3.) The Tribunal's Assessment*\n--------------------------------\n\n504.\n\nIn principle, the decision of the Tallinn City Court involves two different legal regimes, namely international law and Estonian law. Both Parties are of the view that by virtue of the Estonian Constitution, rules and principles of the law of occupation that constitute customary international law are part of Estonian law, including the Hague Regulations.710 Furthermore, neither the Parties nor the Keres Reports take issue with the fact that the Estonian courts applied international law. But the Claimant argues that the Estonian courts reached the wrong result when applying international law because they misinterpreted Article 55 of the Hague Regulations and failed to address Article 53 of the Hague Regulations altogether. More specifically, the Claimant argues that buildings were treated as movables under Estonian law at the time when the Soviet military transferred the assets to private parties in 1990 and 1991. Hence, the Estonian courts should have relied on Article 53 of the Hague Regulations and considered the sales by the Soviet military valid. All subsequent sales from one private party to the other were, according to the Claimant, valid as well, regardless of their compliance with Estonian law since those were governed by the *ex factis* rule.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 278; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 184.\n\n505.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, it is not universally accepted that Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union for more than 50 years in the last century following acts or threats of aggression in 1940. Especially Soviet scholars used to argue that Estonia joined the Soviet Union voluntarily, and this also seems to be the position of the Russian Federation today. Others consider that the law of occupation initially applied in 1940 and for some time thereafter, but doubt that it continued to remain applicable for several decades until the 1990s. The Tribunal stated above that it does not need to determine those issues for the purposes of its decision. For, if the law of occupation is not applicable in the present dispute, it can only be Soviet law, Estonian law, or both that govern the relevant transactions.\n\n506.\n\nThe Estonian courts applied the Hague Regulations as part of Estonian law. The view that Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union is shared by significant parts of the international community and is arguably the predominant opinion in legal scholarship.711 Some authors doubt that the law of occupation can be applicable over several decades, but this is not the prevailing opinion in legal scholarship. Hence, by applying the Hague Regulations as part of Estonian law, the Estonian courts were certainly within the bounds of deference owed by the Tribunal to the courts of the States parties as regards compliance with their own legal system. Nor did the Estonian courts exceed any limits of this deference when they held that the law of occupation did not authorize the Soviet military to sell occupied real estate to private parties. In fact, this is probably the better view, as set out by the Tribunal in its analysis above.\n\nLauri M\u00e4lksoo, *Illegal Annexation and State Continuity: The Case of the Incorporation of the Baltic States by the USSR* (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2003), p. 203 (**CLA-291**); Eyal Benvenisti, *The International Law of Occupation*, (OUP, 2012), p. 151 (**CLA-282**).\n\n507.\n\nFor its position that the Tallinn City Court misapplied Estonian laws and regulations, the Claimant relies on the expert testimony of Mr. Keres. The Second Keres Report assumes that the Soviet Union had become the owner of the Lennusadam Port as a matter of international law. At the Oral Hearing, Mr. Keres confirmed that he did not provide expert testimony on whether and how the Soviet military became the owner of the Lennusadam Port under international law.\n\nHowever, what was the basis under which the Soviet military acquired the property and became the owner of the property, I submit that's where my capabilities as an expert end and yours begin, because I believe that to be a matter of international law rather than Estonian domestic law.712\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 125:16-21.\n\n508.\n\nBased on the assumption that the Soviet military was the owner of the Lennusadam Port, the Second Keres Report analyzes whether any of the Estonian laws and regulations invalided the transactions between the Soviet military and the private parties. It answers this question in the negative.\n\nIf the determination in respect of ownership of the Lennusadam Port is that it did transfer to the ownership of the USSR, then the question that logically follows is whether any of the various laws and regulations adopted by the newly independent Republic of Estonia would be applicable to either expropriate the Lennusadam Port or to invalidate any prior transactions.\n\nAfter careful review of the applicable laws and regulations, I am of the opinion that this is not the case here.713\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 46-47 (**CER-2**).\n\n509.\n\nThe Fourth Keres Report replies to the Respondent's proposition that there was no need to invalidate the transactions by the Soviet military regarding the Lennusadam Port under Estonian law because they were already invalid under international law. In this regard, the Fourth Keres Report considers the parliamentary debate that led to the 23 January 1992 Resolution to be important. That debate and the resulting text of the resolution indicate, according to Mr. Keres, that the Estonian legislator never considered all sales of real estate by the Soviet military to private parties invalid and only sought to forbid them in the future.714 From this, Mr. Keres concludes that the City Court applied the 23 January 1992 retroactively when finding that the relevant transactions by the Soviet military with GT and B&E were invalid, given that they occurred before 1992.\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 57-70 (**CER-8**).\n\n510.\n\nAs outlined in paragraphs 504-506, the Tribunal accepts the findings of the Estonian court that the Soviet military did not become the owner of the Lennusadam Port as a matter of international law. But the Tribunal still needs to assess whether, under the relevant Estonian laws and regulations, the sales by the Soviet military to GT and B&E, as well as the subsequent transactions, can be considered void, as held by the Estonian courts.\n\n511.\n\nIn its reasoning, the City Court relied on a decision of the Supreme Court of Estonia dated 12 December 1994 (\"**1994 Supreme Court Decision**)\".715 The Tribunal considers the decision to be particularly relevant for the present dispute. For, in this decision, Estonia's highest court set out its understanding of the legal instruments of Estonia's transitory regime from 1990 until 1993 that are at issue here as well. This was in 1994, that is, roughly a decade before the Estonian court decisions on the Seaplane Harbor in which the Claimant posits the courts misapplied the law, and several years before the Claimant became active at the port.\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, pp. 23-24, \u00b6 2 (**C-078**).\n\n512.\n\nIn its 1994 decision, the Supreme Court held that Estonia was occupied by, and illegally incorporated into, the Soviet Union with the help of its armed forces in 1940 and that, as the occupant, the Soviet Union could not become the owner of the real estate in Estonia. The relevant reasoning of the Supreme Court and its comments on the individual legal instruments\u2014which are also at issue in the present dispute\u2014are worth quoting at some length:\n\n[1.] [T]he Estonian state has been founded on the basis of the inextinguishable right of the people of Estonia to national self-determination and the Estonian state was proclaimed on 24 February 1918.\n\n[2.] On the basis of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Republic of Estonia was occupied and annexed by the USSR in 1940 with the help of its armed forces and illegally incorporated into the USSR. It was illegal under international law and in conflict with the interests and goals of the people of Estonia set out in the Constitution.\n\n[3.] Based on the supremacy of international law, states are required to follow the rules of international law, including the rules of customary international law. It follows from Article 55 of the IV Hague Convention that the occupying state cannot become the owner of the real estate of the occupied state. It must safeguard the capital of these properties and act merely as their administrator and usufructuary.\n\n[4.] The restoration of Estonia's statehood has been a process whereby the scope, legal substance and form of the underlying political and legal decisions has been based on the opportunities of the restoration forces of the time.\n\n[5.] On 30 March 1990, the Supreme Council of the Estonian SSR as the representation of people at the time expressed its will to restore the independence of the Republic of Estonia and declared the state power of the USSR unlawful in Estonia as from its establishment and declared restoration of the Republic of Estonia (*restitutio ad integrum*). By a decision of 16 May 1990 of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia 'About the Action Programme of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia during the Transition Period until Restoration of the Independence of the Republic of Estonia and the Temporary Order of Government' it was stipulated that the established legal system of the Republic of Estonia is based on the will of the people of Estonia and the generally accepted rules of international law.\n\n[6.] By a decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia of 17 July 1990, changes to the form of ownership of the property belonging to the state were suspended. By a decision of 19 December 1990, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia declared the change of ownership relationships by the USSR forceful and restored the principle of the continuity of ownership. Clause 1 of the decision of the Supreme Council of 29 August 1991 repealed all instruments adopted and passed by the state and governmental bodies of the Republic of Estonia or Estonian SSR after 16 June 1940 by which undertakings, authorities and organisations were transferred under the supervision, administration or management of the state authorities of the USSR. The assets of undertakings, authorities and organisations under the supervision, administration or management of the state authorities of the USSR, which were located in the territory of the Republic of Estonia, were also declared to be the property of the Republic of Estonia. By the decision of the Supreme Council of 23 January 1992 'On declaring the buildings and other assets administered by the armed forces of the former USSR, which are located in the territory of the Republic of Estonia, as the property of the Republic of Estonia,' the buildings and other structures in the possession of the structural units of the armed forces of the former USSR, which were located in the territory of the Republic of Estonia, were declared to be the property of the Republic of Estonia and all transactions with the property without the consent of the government were banned.\n\n[7.] The property of the military is state property. The real estate (i.e. land, buildings and structures) possessed and used by the armed forces of the former USSR was and is the property of the Estonian state. The actual possession, use and disposal of the property became possible gradually as of the making of the decision to restore the Republic of Estonia on 30 March 1990. It follows from international law and the continuity of the Republic of Estonia that the armed forces of the USSR and its structural units were not the legal subject of the transactions made with the land, construction works or objects located in the territory of the Republic of Estonia.\n\n[8.] The submission according to which the real property possessed and used by the armed forces of the USSR did not belong to the Republic of Estonia is erroneous also based on the fact that upon collapse of the USSR a portion of the assets of the former USSR belonged to the Estonian SSR.\n\n[9.] A judicial assessment for the purpose of resolving civil law transactions made with the property of the military has also been given in an order made by the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Estonia on 29 January 1993 and in an order of the Presidium of the Supreme Court on 5 May 1993.\n\n[10.] It follows from the supremacy of the will of the people and the principle of the sovereignty of the state that the authority of the state established on a legal ground has the right to determine the procedure for the possession, use and disposal of the property, which the Riigikogu and the Government of the Republic have done in the present case. The legislature has the inherent right, taking into account the will of the people expressed in the Constitution, keeping in mind the overall interests of the state, and taking into account the actual situation and the principle of legality, to pass retroactively effective legislation that does not fall into the field of criminal law and that amends to annuls prior legislative instruments. However, in the present case there was no need to retroactively annul transactions by an Act and no ground for it, because the respective legal decisions had already been made. The provisions of \u00a7 1 of the Act of 18 May 1993 regarding the annulment of transactions blurred the legislation and are in conflict with the principles of the rule of law, according to which the legislature has the authority to formulate the grounds for the assessment of the validity of transactions, [while] only the judiciary has the authority to declare a transaction void. Therefore, \u00a7 1 of the Act of 18 May 1993 on the annulment of transactions is in conflict with the idea of the Constitution according to which the Republic of Estonia is based on the principles of the rule of law and \u00a7 146 of the Constitution under which only courts can administer justice. The other sections of the Act of 18 May 1993 do not have a separate regulatory meaning.716\n\nDecember 1994 Supreme Court Judgment, pp. 2-3 (paragraph numbers and emphasis added) (**CLA-191**).\n\n513.\n\nAs correctly pointed out by the Claimant, with its decision, the Supreme Court repealed the following provision in the Act of 18 May 1993:\n\nAll transactions made regarding land, buildings and structures that have been or are possessed or used by the structural units of the armed forces of the former USSR, which located or locate in the territory of Estonia, after the 30 of March 1990 without the consent of the Government of the Republic of Estonia are void (including balance sheet transfers).717\n\nAct on the Annulment of Transactions, 18 May 1993 (**C-614**).\n\n514.\n\nBut the Supreme Court considered this provision unconstitutional not because it disagreed with the proposition set out therein, namely that transactions made after 30 March 1990 that sought to transfer land or buildings formerly in possession of the Soviet military were invalid. Rather, the Supreme Court stated that the laws that sustained this proposition had already been enacted prior to the Act of 18 May 1993. Hence, the Supreme Court found that the Act of 18 May 1993 unnecessarily blurred prior legislation.718 It also stated that the legislator might enact laws that stipulate the grounds for the invalidity of transactions, but it is for the judiciary to \"declare a transaction void\", which is why the court considered the Act of 18 May 1993 to violate the rule of law.719\n\n*Supra* \u00b6 512(10).\n\n*Supra* \u00b6 512(10).\n\n515.\n\nFor the present dispute, the salient point of the 1994 Supreme Court Decision is that it clarified the view of Estonia's highest court on the ownership of real estate controlled by the Soviet military during the occupation or parts thereof. The Supreme Court unequivocally stated that that property always was and is the property of the Estonian state, and that the Soviet military was not entitled to enter any sales contracts with others regarding that property.720 The court also stressed that after 30 March 1990, when the restoration of the Republic of Estonia was declared (*restitutio ad integrum*), Estonia could possess and use that property only gradually over time.721 This seems hardly surprising, given that the withdrawal of the Soviet military was a process that was completed only in 1994.\n\n*Supra* \u00b6 512(7).\n\n*Supra* \u00b6 512(7).\n\n516.\n\nIn a decision of 31 January 1995, the Estonian Supreme Court applied the principles just outlined in a case that involved the transfer of buildings and facilities from the Soviet military to a private party via several sales contracts dated 9 October 1991 (\"**1995 Supreme Court Decision**\"). Those sales contracts were considered valid by the Tallinn Circuit Court in a decision dated 19 October 1994, that is, a few weeks before the 1994 Supreme Court Decision. Without guidance from the Supreme Court, the Tallinn Circuit Court reasoned that the 17 July 1990 Resolution did not suspend transactions that involved property of the Soviet military.722 This is also the position of the Claimant and the Keres Reports in the current dispute. But the Supreme Court overruled the Tallinn City Court's decision of 19 October 1994 in its 1995 Decision. It held that the 17 July 1990 Resolution also suspended all transactions with real estate controlled by the Soviet military. The most important part of the 1995 Supreme Court Decision, for the purposes of the present case, reads as follows:\n\nThe decision of 30 March 1990 of the Supreme Council of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic on the national status of Estonia confirmed that the occupation of the Republic of Estonia by the Soviet Union on 17 June 1940 had not interrupted the existence of the Republic of Estonia de jure and the territory of the Republic of Estonia was still occupied to that day. In the same decision, the unlawfulness of the state power of the Soviet Union in Estonia from the moment of its establishment was recognised, and a transitional period for the restoration of the Republic of Estonia was declared. The restoration of the Estonian statehood has been a process in which the wording and form of the underlying legal decisions have depended on the current capabilities of the forces restoring the statehood. This must be taken into account when interpreting the legislation governing the dispute. The Civil Chamber of the Circuit Court has incorrectly interpreted the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia of 17 July 1990 [\u2026] This decision was adopted in the process of the restoration of the Republic of Estonia due to the need to ensure the preservation of state property as state property. Clause 1 of the decision temporarily suspended, pending the adoption of the legislative acts of the Republic of Estonia governing the privatisation of property, all transactions involving the fixed property of state-owned enterprises and other organisations that cause the ownership form of the property to change. Such suspension of transactions meant that the seller, the Baltic Fleet Construction Board, and the buyer, AS Fonon, registered in Estonia, were prohibited from concluding the contract of purchase and sale that changed the ownership form of the property owned by the state. This prohibition also applied to the property managed by the Armed Forces of the former Soviet Union in the territory of Estonia, which constituted state property. Clause 1 of regulation of 7 May 1991 [\u2026] is also based on the aforementioned interpretation of the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia of 17 July 1990, drawing the attention of the heads of state-owned enterprises, institutions and organisations subject to the Soviet Union to the fact that all transactions involving the fixed property of state-owned enterprises that cause the ownership form of the property to change are suspended.\n\nThe fact that the subsequent legal acts referred to in the decision of the Civil Chamber of the Circuit Court (subsection 2 (2) of the decision of 29 August 1991 of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia [\u2026], and clause 5 of the regulation of 12 September 1991 of the Government of the Republic of Estonia \" [\u2026]) dealt with the issues related to the ownership of the property in the possession of or used by the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union or its structural units does not mean that the temporary suspension of transactions indicated in the decision of 17 July 1990 of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia did not prohibit the Baltic Fleet Construction Authority from selling and AS Fonon from purchasing the disputed property on 9 October 1991.723\n\n*See* Supreme Court of Estonia, Case No. III-1/1-6/95, Judgment, 31 January 1995, p. 2 (**RLA-114**).\n\nSupreme Court of Estonia, Case No. III-1/1-6/95, Judgment, 31 January 1995, pp. 3-4 (**RLA-114**).\n\n517.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this reasoning important in assessing whether the courts misapplied Estonian law when deciding that the transactions by B&E and GT with the Soviet military were invalid, and that the subsequent transactions did not lead to a change in ownership of the Seaplane Harbor. With these observations in mind, the Tribunal will now address some of the legal instruments that the Claimant and the Keres Reports opine were misapplied by the Tallinn City Court in its July 2005 Judgment.\n\n518.\n\nAs set out above in paragraphs 501 and 502, the Tallinn City Court considered the transfers of the relevant assets from the Soviet military to B&E and GT invalid because they were not in line with the 17 July 1990 Resolution. That resolution read as follows:\n\n1. To suspend temporarily, until the adoption of Estonian legislative acts regulating the privatization of the property, all transactions with the statutory fund property of state-owned enterprises and other organisations, which cause a change in the ownership of such property, except in the cases provided in section 3.2. of this resolution and also the transfer of property from state farms to collective farms following the established procedure.\n\n2. To acknowledge that based on the protocol decision from May 27th this year the Government of Estonian Republic will develop the privatization concept (the general principles of the privatization process and their execution in specific areas) and will submit it by September 1st this year to the Supreme Council of Estonian Republic for review.\n\n3. To assign the Government of Estonian Republic:\n\n3.1. To compile an overview of the state-owned property at the territory of Estonian Republic and outside of it and the state's obligations regarding the return or compensation of the unlawfully transferred property to its prior owners or their legal successors.\n\n3.2. To prepare by August 10\u1d57\u02b0 the draft of Estonian law regarding the procedure and conditions of privatization of consumer service, trade and catering enterprises with the balance sheet value until 500 000 roubles.\n\n3.3. [\u2026]724\n\nResolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia regarding the Initial Measures for Organising the Privatization Process, 17 July 1990 (**CLA-195**).\n\n519.\n\nThe reasons provided by the Claimant and the Keres Reports for the alleged inapplicability of the 17 July 1990 Resolution to the transfer of the relevant buildings and structures at the Seaplane Harbor to B&E and GT appear to be threefold. First, the Keres Reports state that this resolution was meant to ban only the transfer of assets by Estonian state-owned entities and not by the Soviet military within Estonia.725 The Tribunal notes that the unclear wording of section 1 of the 17 July 1990 Resolution does not exclude the interpretation suggested by the Claimant and the Keres Reports. In section 1, the Supreme Council \"suspend[ed] temporarily, until the adoption of Estonian legislative acts regulating the privatization of the property, all transactions with the statutory fund property of state-owned enterprises and other organisations.\"726\n\n*See, e.g.,* Second Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 80, 84 (**CER-2**); Third Keres Report, \u00b6 78 (**CER-4**).\n\n*See supra,* \u00b6 518.\n\n520.\n\nBut nor does this wording exclude the view adopted by the Tallinn City Court in 2005 and by the Estonian Supreme Court as early as 1995, namely that section 1 includes property of the Soviet military.727 Already in its 1994 Decision, the Supreme Court clarified its understanding of the March 1990 Resolution, the acts subsequently adopted during the transition phase, and the relevant principles of international law. It stated that the Soviet military had never become the owner of real estate it controlled as an occupant until the 1990s following the forced integration of Estonia into the Soviet Union in 1940. Consequently, the March 1990 Resolution declared (i) that the territory of Estonia is \"still occupied\", (ii) the \"restoration of the Republic of Estonia (*restitutio ad integrum*)\", and (iii) that a \"temporary management regime\" will be developed for the \"transitional period\".728 The 17 July 1990 Resolution was one of the first steps of the transitory regime established after the March 1990 Resolution.\n\n*See supra,* \u00b6 516.\n\nResolution of the Supreme Council of the ESSR on the National Status of Estonia, 29 March 1990 (**RLA-049**).\n\n521.\n\nAt that time, the Soviet armed forces were still present in Estonia, and their withdrawal, as well as (property) issues related thereto, were subject to negotiations that would continue for several years. The Supreme Court explained in its 1994 Decision that reestablishing Estonia's statehood and its ownership rights was a process influenced by the circumstances on the ground.729 Against this background, the Tribunal finds it unsurprising that later legislative and regulatory acts were more explicit than the 17 July 1990 Resolution when addressing assets controlled by the Soviet military that Estonia deemed to be its own. But the text of section 1 is vague enough to include those assets. The context of this provision provides additional support for the view of the Estonian courts. For as per its preamble, the 17 July 1990 Resolution sought \"to execute the ownership right of the Estonian Republic.\" Its section 3.1 ordered the government to prepare an overview of all \"state-owned property,\" with a view to its possible return to prior owners expropriated after 1940. There is no reason why real estate controlled by the Soviet military should be excluded from the scope of the 17 July 1990 Resolution or any of its provisions.\n\n*Supra*, \u00b6 512(4).\n\n522.\n\nThe *second* reason why the Keres Reports consider the 17 July 1990 Resolution to be inapplicable is that it governs only the transfer of property through state-owned\u2014and not private\u2014enterprises and organizations.730 The premise of this argument seems to be that with so-called Resolution 477, the \"Lennusadam Port in its entirety was transferred from the military to private companies on 29 December 1989\".731 But Resolution 477 records only the establishment of the small enterprise SEK (by the Baltic Fleet Building Government, Military Factory 84, and two other founding members). It says nothing about the transfer of assets, let alone of those at issue here. Rather, according to SEK's own directive 17/90, the relevant buildings and other structures were taken to its balance sheet only on 1 November 1990 and on that day transferred to B&E.732 This means that prior to 1 November 1990, the relevant assets were under the control of the Soviet military even under the assumption that SEK is a \"private company.\" In any event, the Tribunal finds the categorization of SEK as a \"state small enterprise\" in the Petrachkov Report more persuasive than its characterization as a private company.733 This seems to be more in line with the view undisputed by the Claimant that military bases were state-owned under Soviet law and could not be transferred to private parties.\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6 50 (**CER-8**).\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6 50 (**CER-8**).\n\nSEK Directive No. 17/90 (**C-024**).\n\nPetrachkov Report, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 16 (**RER-2**).\n\n523.\n\nThe *third* argument in the Keres Reports for why the transfer of property to B&E remained unaffected by the 17 July 1990 Resolution is that this resolution is not applicable retroactively.734 But as set out above, the relevant assets were not transferred to B&E until 1 November 1990. In this regard, it seems immaterial whether one of the two incompatible versions of Contract No. 16 dated 22 May 1990 is authentic, or whether\u2014as suggested by the Respondent\u2014both are forged.735 This is because such a contract may have obliged Military Company No. 84 to transfer certain assets to B&E, but this is different from the transfer itself.736 Nor does the Tribunal consider it decisive whether B&E gained control of the relevant assets already on 5 June 1990, as recorded in a document allegedly signed by BFC, Military Company 84, and B&E on that day.737 For, this document is compatible with Resolution 477 of 1 November 1990 only if B&E became the possessor but not the owner of the relevant buildings and structures on 5 June 1990.\n\nThird Keres Report, \u00b6 232 (**CER-4**).\n\n*See* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 116-117.\n\n*See also* Memorial, \u00b6 68, where the Claimant states that \"[i]n May 1990, Military Factor No. 84, one of the joint owners of SEK, agreed to sell all of SEK's Port assets to O\u00dc B&E (\"B&E\") [\u2026] That transfer was finalized on November 1, 1990.\"\n\nThe Respondent seems to consider this document to be forged as well, *see* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 112-117 in the section entitled \"Evidence confirming forgery of all B&E documents\".\n\n524.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal agrees with the Estonian courts' conclusion that the transfer of the relevant assets to B&E was in breach of the 17 July 1990 Resolution. The same applies to the transfers by the Soviet military of the other assets at the Port to GT Project on 17 August 1991, that is, more than a year after the 17 July 1990 Resolution was enacted.\n\n525.\n\nAs set out above, the Keres Reports assume that the Soviet military became the legal owner of the Seaplane Harbor under international law. Based on this assumption, the Keres Reports consider it necessary that one of the legal instruments enacted by Estonia during the transition phase had annulled the sales of the Soviet military to the private parties. Given that the Tribunal neither shares the basic assumption of the Keres Reports nor considers the 17 July 1990 Resolution inapplicable, much of the discussion regarding the transitory regime might be redundant. Still, the Tribunal will analyze whether any of the acts invoked in the Keres Reports justify the conclusion that the Estonian courts erred when they considered the relevant transactions to be invalid.\n\n526.\n\nFrom the legal instruments enacted by Estonia between July 1990 and 1992 introduced in paragraphs 163-175 above, the Keres Reports focuses on three of them to establish that B&E and GT became the lawful owners of the relevant real estate. These acts are the 19 December 1990 Resolution, the 27 November 1991 Regulation, and the 23 January 1992 Resolution,738 which the Tribunal will address in turn.\n\nThe 19 December 1990 Resolution\n\n*See* Fourth Keres Report, \u00b6 50 (**CER-8**).\n\n527.\n\nThe 19 December 1990 Resolution acknowledged that certain acts of the ESSR and the Soviet Union regarding the nationalization and collectivization of property were unlawful. To enable the return of that property to their rightful owners, the resolution requested the government to recommend steps regarding the listing of previous owners and their successors.739 The Keres Reports opine that this resolution applies only to property taken after 23 July 1940. This date is mentioned in section 1, which addresses specified regulatory acts, e.g., the \"Declaration of nationalization of banks and major industries\". But the issue of whether the Soviet military took over the Seaplane Plane Harbor before or after a possible start date regarding the nationalizations covered by this resolution seems irrelevant. This is because the resolution was concerned with preparatory steps regarding the return of state assets to their original owners from whom those assets were taken between 1940 and 1990. It seems nonsensical to ask whether such a resolution applies to real estate that, between 1918 and 1990, had never been in private ownership but always in the possession of state authorities, since 1940 in that of the Soviet military. The declaration of certain acts of nationalization as unlawful in the 19 December 1990 Resolution does not mean that the Soviet military was the rightful owner of real estate not covered by those acts. Rather, the 30 March 1990 Resolution (as interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1994 and 1995) established that the Soviet Union as an illegal occupant had never become the owner of the real estate in Estonia.\n\n27 November 1991 Regulation\n\n19 December 1990 Resolution (**CLA-196**).\n\n528.\n\nThe 27 November 1991 Regulation, in contrast, seems to apply to the alleged transfers of the relevant assets by the Soviet military to B&E and GT. However, the Claimant and the Keres Reports correctly point out that those transfers do not fall under the ban on transactions made by the USSR Defense Ministry stipulated in section 1. The 27 November 1991 Regulation reads in relevant part as follows:\n\nAccording to the Estonian Republic Supreme Council's decision \"About independence of the state of Estonia\" dated 20 Aug 1991 and taking into consideration the need for quick withdrawal of forces of USSR Military from ER territory and in this respect the defense of the ER economic interests, the ER State Government decides:\n\n1. To stop transactions made by USSR Defense Ministry without agreement from ER State Government with buildings, structures and other property assets located on ER territory until the corresponding decision is made by ER Supreme Council.\n\n2. Establish that all transactions made before enactment of the current Ruling by USSR Defense Ministry or by its dependent legal entities with landholdings, buildings and other property assets located on ER territory have to be registered with the correspondent county or city administration within one month from enactment of the current Ruling.\n\nNew transactions can be made only when coordinated with ER State Chancellery.740\n\nRegulation No. 244 (**CLA-197**).\n\n529.\n\nSince the transfers of the buildings and structures at the Seaplane Harbor from the Soviet military to B&E and GT occurred before the 27 November 1991 Regulation was enacted, the stop of transactions set out in section 1 does not apply to those transfers. But they had to be registered according to section 2. Neither of the Parties denies that. The Claimant argues that non-registration entailed no penalties, which seems correct, and unsurprising considering the legal framework put in place since March 1990. As held in the 1994 and 1995 Supreme Court Decisions, Estonia always owned the real estate controlled by the Soviet military, who could not validly sell that real estate to private parties without Estonia's consent. The only way for private parties to ensure they could remain in possession of the real estate purchased from the Soviet military and acquire ownership was to register that property and await the outcome of administrative proceedings. Registration was therefore in the very interest of private parties, and penalization of non-registration unnecessary.\n\n530.\n\nIn this regard, it bears emphasis that the Estonian courts considered the transfer of the relevant buildings and structures to B&E and GT invalid not only because of the 17 July 1990 Resolution. Rather, the Tallinn City Court added that these transactions were, in any case, void because they did not comply with the registration requirements of the 27 November 1991 Regulation and the 24 July 1992 Regulation.741 The Tribunal based this conclusion on section 51(1) and section 62(1) of the Civil Code, which read as follows:\n\nSection 51. Invalidity of a legal act which is not in accordance with the requirements of the law\n\n(1) A legal act which is not in accordance with the requirements of the law is invalid.\n\nSection 62. The time from which a legal act is considered invalid\n\n(1) A legal act which is declared invalid is considered invalid from the time at which it was concluded.\n\n(2) However, if the content of the legal act indicates that it may be terminated only for the future, the effect of the legal act which has been declared invalid terminates for the future.742\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, p. 26, \u00b6 4 (regarding the transfer to GT) and \u00b6 10 (regarding the transfer to B&E) (**C-078**)\n\nCivil Code of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, 12 June 1964, sections 51, 62 (**RLA-051**).\n\n531.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal finds the conclusion that the non-registration of the relevant transactions was in breach of the 27 November 1991 Regulation, and therefore void according to section 51(1) and section 62(1) of the Civil Code, plausible and correct.\n\nThe 23 January 1992 Resolution\n\n532.\n\nOne of the key arguments of the Claimant and the Keres Reports is that the Estonian courts invalidated the sales by the Soviet military to private parties based on an unlawful retroactive application of the 23 January 1992 Resolution, which reads as follows.\n\nConsidering the need for quick withdrawal of USSR Military forces from ER territory and in this respect the defense of the ER economic interests, the ER State Supreme Council decides: 1. To declare buildings, structures, military weapons, military hardware, supplies and other assets possessed by former USSR military forces units located on ER territory to become the property of the Estonian Republic.\n\n2. The ER State Government has to determine composition of the assets possessed by former USSR military forces units located on ER territory and has to solve administrative and technical problems of taking over assets by collaborating with appropriate agencies of the legal successor of USSR, also has to arrange the administration, usage and control over these assets.\n\n3. Prohibit all transactions with land, buildings, structures, military weapons, military hardware, supplies and other assets located on ER territory and belonging to the former USSR military units without permission from the ER State Government.\n\n4. Annul all land allotments made by Estonian Soviet Republic to soviet army, navy and USSR State Safety Committee and void all regional special regimes [\u2026].743\n\nSupreme Council of Estonia, Resolution regarding Declaration of Buildings, Structures, Military Weapons, Military Hardware, Supplies and Other Assets Possessed by Former USSR Military Forces Located on ER Territory to Become the Property of the Estonian Republic, 23 January 1992 (**C-197**).\n\n533.\n\nRead in isolation, the 23 January 1992 Resolution provides support for the Claimant's position. Since section 1 declared certain assets (including buildings) possessed by the former Soviet military to \"become\" the property of the Estonian Republic, it seems arguable that\u2014*e contrario*\u2014 they were not owned by Estonia before 23 January 1992. In a similar vein, it is not unreasonable to argue that if section 2 prohibits transactions regarding those assets without permission of the Estonian government, such transactions must have been valid if made prior to 23 January 1992.\n\n534.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, however, these points do not warrant the conclusion that the Tallinn City Court decided the ownership issues regarding the Seaplane Harbor wrongly. To begin with, the court did not base its decision on the 23 January 1992 Resolution. Rather it referred to this Resolution when setting out the content of the 1994 Supreme Court Decision, jointly with the other legal instruments cited in paragraph 512 above. When applying the law to the facts, the Tallinn City Court considered the relevant transactions void because of two other, independent reasons, namely non-compliance with the 17 July 1990 Resolution and the failure to register the transactions (in breach of the 27 November 1991 Regulation and the 24 July 1992 Regulation). Moreover, it seems understandable that the clarity of the language in Estonian legal acts unfavorable to the occupying forces increased over time. As the Estonian Supreme Court put it in 1994, \"the restoration of Estonia's statehood has been a process whereby the scope, legal substance and form of the underlying political and legal decisions has been based on the opportunities of the restoration forces of the time.\"744\n\n*Supra*, para. 512(4).\n\n535.\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal does not consider it decisive that the drafting history of the 23 January 1992 Resolution may have revealed different views among the delegates to the Estonian Supreme Council regarding the proper formulation of the relevant legal instruments. The Keres Reports rightly point out that the final text of section 3 of the 23 January 1992 Resolution was proposed by the delegate, Mr. Ahti K\u00f5o. The prior draft of that section stated that the Supreme Council decided to:\n\ndeclare any and all transactions made with land, buildings, structures, arms, battle equipment, supplies and other property located in the territory of the Republic of Estonia, which belong to the structural units of the armed forces of the former USSR, and are in conflict with the legislative acts of the Republic of Estonia, invalid.745\n\nTranscript of the session of the Supreme Council, 21 January 1992, p. 17 (**C-199**) (emphasis added).\n\n536.\n\nMr. K\u00f5o's concern regarding that draft provision was mainly as follows:\n\nAs I understand it, the current version declares transactions retroactively invalid as well. I wouldn't argue against the idea but I have a question regarding those that have in good faith and without disregarding the normative instruments currently in force concluded transactions and acquired the real or movable property of the military. Is it correct to extrajudicially declare these transactions invalid?\n\nSecond. If you do consider it correct and should it happen that such a decision that is in conflict with the principles of the rule of law is adopted, how will the issues of the individuals and entities that have acquired property in good faith and in line with the laws in force to date be solved? How will they be compensated for the damage suffered by them by purchasing property and paying for it in cash or in other things of value?746\n\nTranscript of the session of the Supreme Council, 21 January 1992, pp. 4-5 (**C-199**) (emphasis added).\n\n537.\n\nThe Tribunal considers two points of this criticism particularly important. First, Mr. K\u00f5o was concerned that the initial draft would declare transactions \"extrajudicially\" invalid, that is, without involvement of the courts. This was a legitimate concern. In its 1994 Decision set out above, the Estonian Supreme Court found a provision unconstitutional that contained a similar formulation as the initial draft of section 2. In that decision, the Supreme Court reasoned that it was for the legislator to provide grounds for the invalidity of transactions but for the courts to declare those transactions invalid. The change from \"declare\" to \"prohibit\" in section 2 may have avoided a similar problem with respect to the 23 January 1992 Resolution.\n\n538.\n\nThe second point that the Tribunal considers important is that Mr. K\u00f5o sought protection for those \"who have acquired property in good faith and in line with the laws in force to date\".747 This seems to imply that Mr. K\u00f5o did not doubt that non-compliance with the regulatory regime in place prior to the 23 January 1992 Resolution is a ground for the invalidity of earlier transactions.\n\nTranscript of the session of the Supreme Council, 21 January 1992, p. 5 (**C-199**) (emphasis added).\n\n539.\n\nIn response to Mr. K\u00f5o's concerns, Mr. Vare\u2014the state minister who presented the draft\u2014invited Mr. K\u00f5o to suggest a wording that would make it clearer that avenues for the protection of those who bought property from the Soviet military in good faith would remain available. Mr. Vare stated that:\n\nFor those who have acted in good faith, if there is indeed such a need, we should simply introduce a clause. Kindly suggest your wording that would make the provision clearer in the decision. Nevertheless, we should carefully examine all the transactions, including those made in good faith. Otherwise we will not gain control of the scope of the actual transactions. In that regard I do not consider the decision to be in conflict with legal principles. In reality, the sale of the property of the armed forces without the participation of Estonia is considered to conflict with these principles. Thereby the unlawfulness of the matter exists a priori and in that regard we cannot use the excuse of the unawareness of the law or procedure also in the case of these good faith transactions. Those who acted in good faith while being perfectly aware of the situation will need to address the government on the basis of the procedure in force.748\n\nTranscript of the session of the Supreme Council, 21 January 1992, p. 5 (**C-199**) (emphasis added).\n\n540.\n\nThe words with which Mr. K\u00f5o later introduced his draft provision strongly suggest that he agreed that real estate transactions between the Soviet military and private parties that occurred prior to the 23 January 1992 Resolution were not necessarily valid. He stated that:\n\nNow comes the amendment. Instead of concluded transactions we should speak of banning transactions with the property belonging to the armed forces of the former USSR or their structural units. In such a situation it would be logically clear that prior transactions have to be judicially declared invalid, where necessary.749\n\nTranscript of the session of the Supreme Council, 21 January 1992, p. 5 (**C-199**) (emphasis added).\n\n541.\n\nThe 2005 Decisions of the Estonian courts regarding the ownership of the Seaplane Hangar seem in line with this position. After all, the courts held that the relevant transactions made with the Soviet military in 1990 and 1991 were invalid because they were in breach of the 17 July 1990 Resolution and, in addition, the buyers did not comply with the registration requirements. In any event, even a different understanding of the 23 January 1992 Resolution and its drafting history would not mean that the Estonian court misapplied the law. This is because subsequent legislation\u2014here, the 23 January 1992 Resolution\u2014may be relevant in interpreting prior legal instruments at issue, that is, here the 17 July 1990 Resolution and the 27 November 1991 Regulation. But this does not mean that this interpretative means outweighs other considerations, such as the reasons the Tallinn City Court provided for its decision.\n\nThe 24 July 1992 Regulation\n\n542.\n\nAs set out above, one of those reasons was the non-compliance of the buyers with the relevant registration requirements, stipulated not only in the 27 November 1991 Regulation, but also subsequently in the 24 July 1992 Regulation, which read as follows:\n\n1. Transactions concluded between former units of USSR armed forces and any enterprise, establishment, organization or private person regarding the land, buildings and structures on the territory of the Republic of Estonia that are in accordance with the law must be re-registered in the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Estonia by August 15, 1992.\n\nThe Ministry of Defense has to take into account the standpoint of the government committee formed for the supervision of the legality of these transactions when re-registering the transactions.\n\n2. To forbid any further transactions of the enterprises, establishments, organizations and private people of the Republic of Estonia with the land, buildings and structures on the Republic of Estonia acquired from the units of the former USSR armed forces.750\n\n24 July 1992 Regulation (**C-198**).\n\n543.\n\nSection 1 of this Resolution names the Ministry of Defense as the addressee of the re-registrations. Under the prior 27 November 1991 Regulation, the relevant registrations had to be made with the country or city administration within one month from 27 November 1991. It seems possible to understand the requirement to re-register the transaction as an extension of the one-month deadline imposed by the 27 November 1991 Regulation. But given the use of the word \"re-registration\" and the new addressee, it seems more plausible to interpret section 1 not as an additional registration opportunity but as a separate obligation. This seems in line with one of the explanations provided by the Respondent in response to the Tribunal's question regarding the meaning of the term \"in accordance with the law\" in section 1. In this regard, the Respondent suggests that only transactions that had already been registered on the municipal level were \"in accordance with the law\" and subject to the possibility of validation.751 In any event, the precise relationship between the two registration requirements was not decisive for the outcome of the proceedings before the Estonian courts regarding the Seaplane Hangar, for it is common ground between the Parties that the relevant transactions were registered neither on the municipal level nor with the Ministry of Defense.\n\nRespondent's PHB, \u00b6 30.\n\n544.\n\nSection 2 of the 24 July 1992 Regulation \"forbid any transactions\" with the real estate and other assets \"acquired from the units of the former USSR armed forces.\" This wording seems to suggest that section 2 prohibited transactions between public or private parties regarding real estate once acquired from former units of the Soviet military, and not only purchases from such units. But given that the Tallinn City Court did not rely on such a proposition, its merit is irrelevant here.\n\n545.\n\nHaving found that the Estonian courts did not err when they considered the transfers of the buildings and structures at the port to GT and B&E to be invalid, the Tribunal must now assess the Estonian courts' holding that the transaction was invalid *ex tunc*. *Ex tunc* invalidity is the general rule in section 62 of the Civil Code, and *ex nunc* invalidity is the exception:\n\nSection 62. The time from which a legal act is considered invalid\n\n(1) A legal act which is declared invalid is considered invalid from the time at which it was concluded.\n\n(2) However, if the content of the legal act indicates that it may be terminated only for the future, the effect of the legal act which has been declared invalid terminates for the future.\n\n546.\n\nAccording to the plain reading of this provision, it seems correct that the Tallinn City Court relied on section 62(1) of the Civil Code and considered the transactions by the Soviet military invalid752 *ex tunc*.\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, pp. 25-26, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10 (**C-078**).\n\n547.\n\nThe Second Keres Report opines that the 23 January 1992 Resolution \"cannot be interpreted to have an effect of voiding *ab initio* all transactions with the former Soviet armed forces.\"753 The Tribunal is not convinced that this consideration is relevant here. For the City Court did not base the invalidity of the transactions on the 23 January 1992 Resolution but on the 17 July 1990 Resolution and the lack of their registration (as required by the 27 November 1991 Regulation and the 24 July 1992 Regulation). But the Tribunal is not even persuaded that a hypothetical transaction in violation of the 23 January 1992 Resolution that took place in 1993 could be invalidated only with effect from the date on which the relevant judgment was rendered, say in 2005. The drafting history of the 23 January 1992 Resolution does not seem to support such an *ex nunc* invalidity. This is because Mr. K\u00f5o was not concerned with the date from which transactions that were found invalid by the Estonian courts would have to be treated as invalid. Rather, his concern was that the initial draft of the 23 January 1992 Resolution declared past transactions invalid, \"retroactively\" and \"extrajudicially\", without the involvement of the courts.754\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 64 (**CER-2**).\n\nTranscript of the session of the Supreme Council, 21 January 1992, pp. 4-5 (**C-199**) (emphasis added).\n\n548.\n\nNor does the Tribunal find that the 1994 Supreme Court Decision relied on in the Keres Reports speaks for the *ex nunc*\u2014as opposed to *ex tunc*\u2014invalidity of the attempted property transfers from the Soviet military to the GT and B&E.755 In that decision, the Supreme Court repealed a law of 1993. That law declared transactions with the Soviet military invalid that were \u2014in the view of the court\u2014already invalid based on a proper interpretation of the prior acts enacted since March 1990 as part of the transitory regime. But since the 1993 law unnecessarily blurred that prior legislation, and it is for courts and not the legislator to declare transactions invalid, the Supreme Court held that the 1993 law was unconstitutional.756 Nothing in the 1994 Supreme Court Decision suggests that court decisions that find transactions to be invalid should lead only to the *ex nunc* invalidity of such transactions.\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63 (**CER-2**).\n\n*See supra \u00b6\u00b6* 511-515.\n\n549.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal shares the opinion of the Tallinn City Court that the transfers of the relevant assets to B&E and GT were invalid *ex tunc* pursuant to section 62(1) of the Civil Code.\n\n550.\n\nThe last issue to be addressed is whether the Tallinn City Court misapplied the law when it found that Agrin and Verest did not become the owners of the relevant assets through the acquisition of those assets in good faith. As mentioned in paragraph 503 above, the Tallinn City Court held that such good-faith acquisitions by those entities (and prior to Verest, by Nautex) were impossible under Estonian law, for two different stand-alone reasons. First, good faith acquisition from non-owners is impossible if the owner\u2014here, the Republic of Estonia\u2014lost the relevant asset against its will. Second, none of the alleged successors in title to B&E and GT was in good faith.\n\n551.\n\nThe rule underlying the *first* proposition is part of many civil law systems and clearly set out in section 156(1) of the Civil Code and section 95 of the Law of Property Act.757 Given that the March 1990 Resolution stated that the Soviet occupation was illegal, the Estonian court's reasoning that Estonia lost the Seaplane Harbor against its will in 1940 as a matter of Estonian law is plausible. It is also consistent with the transitory regime in its entirety and then with the 1994 Decision of the Estonian Supreme Court, which stated that the Soviet Union had never become the owner of Estonian real estate.758\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 275, 283. The Estonian Code from 1964 remained in force until 1994. The Law of Property Act from 1993 governs the transfer of the relevant assets from B&E that allegedly occurred in 1997.\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 512(3), (7).\n\n552.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis could stop here, but a few remarks are in order regarding the Estonian court's alternative reasoning that none of the relevant entities was in good faith. It bears emphasis that the relevant entities are GT, Nautex, and Verest, as well as B&E and Agrin. Any possible good faith of BPV is irrelevant as regards questions of ownership. BPV acquired Verest and Agrin in 1999. The alleged transfers of the assets to Verest and Agrin took place before that, namely in 1992 and 1997, respectively. Through the acquisition of Verest and Agrin in 1999, BPV could not become the indirect owner of assets that Verest and Agrin had never acquired.\n\n553.\n\nBased on the documentary record and the facts established by the Estonian courts, the Tribunal considers it impossible that any of the relevant entities did not know that the real estate at the Seaplane Harbor was in the possession of the Soviet military. The reoccurrence of individuals in the history of the Seaplane Harbor during the transactional history until 1997, and indeed 1999, is extraordinary. An individual who was apparently involved in some role or other until 1999 is the former army officer Dmitri Sukortsev. On behalf of 1176 UNR, he signed the contract with GT dated 17 August 1991. GT was represented in that transaction by Margo Purru. On the same day, that is, 17 August 1991, GT passed the relevant assets on to Nautex. On 7 May 1992, Nautex\u2014represented by Margo Purro (who had represented GT on 17 August 1991), concluded the sales contract with Verest. The shares in Verest, in turn, were held by Dmitri Sukortsev and Mr. Toom from August 1991 until 23 September 1999.\n\n554.\n\nRegarding B&E, the Claimant argues that this entity remained the owner of the relevant buildings and structures from 1990 until they were sold to Agrin on 26 September 1997. On behalf of Agrin the sales contract was signed by Enn Laansoo, who had been a consultant to the Ministry of Justice in 1996 and apparently suggested that the state sell the entire real estate.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n555.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal shares the opinion of the Estonian courts that none of the Claimant's subsidiaries became the owner of the buildings and structures at the Seaplane Harbor, let alone of the underlying land. As set out above, the Tribunal is also convinced that the sale of the Seaplane Harbor to private entities would have been illegal under Soviet law. If the law of occupation is applicable here, on which the Tribunal takes no final view, then Estonia was acting well within its margin of appreciation when it reversed the alleged sales of the buildings and structures at the Seaplane Harbor through the Soviet military to private parties. This is because those sales were not in line with the applicable local law, a necessary requirement for any finding that, through their reversal, Estonia acted in violation of international law.\n\n**c) The Lease Agreements and Possessory Rights**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. The Respondent's Position*\n------------------------------\n\n556.\n\nIn the absence of a title, the Respondent objects to the Claimant's reliance on its alleged good faith possession of the property to claim Treaty protection because, according to the Respondent, good faith possession is not a recognized property right under Estonian law and thus cannot be protected under the Treaty.759 In this respect, the Respondent stresses that an investment exists only when the investor can demonstrate the existence of an underlying right created according to municipal law.760 Therefore, even if good faith possession could fit under the broad definition of investment in Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty, the Respondent argues that \"it would not be afforded treaty protection if it is simultaneously not protected under Estonian law.\"761\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 244.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 247-251, *referring to EnCana Corporation v.

The Law of Property Act, according to the Respondent, changed the understanding of ownership and, as such, the term \"title-bearing possessor\" was not contained in the Law of Property Act as \"the ambiguous category of non-owners no longer existed.\" *See* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 274. *See also* Priidu P\u00e4rna, Asja\u00f5igusseadus.

According to the Respondent, any attempts by the Claimant and Mr. Keres on the concept of \"title-bearing possession\" in the Claimant's 1 October 2021 Submission should be disregarded because the Respondent had already addressed the issue in its Counter-Memorial. *See* 3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 20.\n\nRespondent's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6 23, *referring to* March 2006 Appeal Judgment (**C-081**). *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 107:19-21.\n\n559.\n\nAs to the Claimant's argument regarding the presumptions set out in the Law of Property Act, \"until proven otherwise,\" the Respondent contends that the burden lies on the person contesting possession to prove that he or she is the lawful possessor.772 In addition, the Respondent maintains that there is no rule under Estonian law nor under international law that obliges the government to ignore convincing *prima facie* evidence of the illegality of possession pending a final court decision.773\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 15, *citing* Law of Property Act, 1 December 1993, sections 34(2), 35(3) (**CLA-188**).\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 17. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 144:3-10.\n\n560.\n\nInstead, the Respondent advances that the \"grammatical, systematic, historical and purposive interpretation\" of the term \"title-bearing possessor\" demonstrates that the term refers to possession with a legal basis that must not only appear valid but be in fact valid.774 In response to Mr. Keres' proposition that no two different terms with the same meaning could have existed contemporaneously under the Commercial Lease Act and the Law of Property Act, the Respondent contends that \"the fact that the language of the Rental Act lagged behind the more recent Law of Property Act means nothing,\" considering the \"comprehensive reform of the entire legal system after five decades of occupation.\"775\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 262-266, 268-272.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 126.\n\n561.\n\nThe Respondent further contests Mr. Keres' reliance on a sole decision of the Circuit decision, which touches upon the disputed issues only passingly and is, in any event, not binding under Estonia's civil law-based system.776 Conversely, the Respondent considers the Chancellor of Justice's conclusion, which equated the term to that of lawful possessor, more convincing as he undertook a thorough examination of the meaning of the term in the legal system as a whole.777\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 262, 267, *referring to* Circuit Court of Tallinn, Case No. 2-99-10, 12 March 2010, Judgment, p. 2 (**CLA-193**); Rejoinder, \u00b6 127.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 275, *referring to* Chancellor of Justice Mr. E.-J.

and (ii) these agreements were first presented to the court only in 2005 in support of the Claimant's claims of lawful possession of the Harbor against Estonia.783\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 280-282, 300, *referring to* Lease Agreement between BPV and Verest, 1 October 1997 (**C-046**);

Mr. Keres further notes that due to the short period of implementation, there are no abundant cases where the court has defined the term \"title-bearing possessor.\"\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 50(d) (**CER-8**). *See also* 1 December 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 66-67, 73.\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6 57 (**CER-8**). *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 51:1-8.\n\n577.\n\nAs such, Mr. Keres considers that the Tallinn Circuit Court's decision to hold the lease agreements under which BPV had acquired possessions of the Seaplane Harbor at K\u00fcti 17 null and void *ab initio* due to a violation of section 5(1) of the Commercial Lease Act on the ground that Verest and Agrin were not owners of the property was \"unreasonably restrictive,\" as both Verest and Agrin acquired possession of the property by *prima facie* legal means and were thus title-bearing possessors within the meaning of section 5(1) of the Commercial Lease Act.822 This title-bearing possessors' right to lease, Mr. Keres adds, was derived from section 7(2) of the Ownership Act, or alternatively, from section 68(1) of the Law of Property Act.823\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 90-95, 104 (**CER-2**), *referring to* March 2006 Appeal Judgment (**C-081**). *See also* Claimant's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6 130.\n\nThird Keres Report, \u00b6 86 (**CER-4**), *referring to* Ownership Act, 1 December 1993, section 7(2) (**RLA-065**); Law of Property Act, 9 June 1993, section 68(1) (**RLA-052**).\n\n578.\n\nFurther, Mr. Keres is of the view that the Estonian courts made a \"serious error\" under the principle of *iura novit curia* by failing to consider title-bearing possession as a basis for ongoing possession, even if those legal arguments or relevant evidence were not brought before the courts by the parties.824 The principle of *iura novit curia*, the Claimant continues, is fundamental to all Estonian proceedings, as set out in section 436(7) of the Estonian Code of Civil Procedure.825\n\n1 October 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21; Fourth Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 40-41 (**CER-8**), *referring to* Letter from the Advisor of Chancellor of Justice to B&E, 23 October 1997 (**C-331**).

Russia*, the Claimant argues that the existence of an investment under the Treaty \"must be interpreted autonomously, *i.e.*, not in accordance with the domestic legal orders of the contracting State parties involved\" but by international law principles, including the European Convention on Human Rights which, by using the term \"possession,\" extends the right to property under Article 1 to a wide variety of property interests, including the use of land and commercial activities attached thereto.826\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 223-228, *citing Renta 4 S.V.A. et al. v.

The Claimant explains that the leases only required a total investment over the term of the lease (USD 5 million in at the Lennusadam Port and another USD 5 million in the Portlands by 1 January 2001), without requiring annual investments to reach the thresholds. *See* Reply, \u00b6 193.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 177, 182, *referring to* Port Plan (**C-142**);

The Tribunal's Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n587.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the Parties' arguments in the context of the lease agreements and the Claimant's alleged possessory rights give rise to three main issues: first, whether Agrin and Verest were so-called title-bearing possessors that could conclude valid lease agreements with BPV; secondly, whether the lease agreements were concluded in 1997, or submitted as backdated and forged documents in the Estonian Court proceedings in 2005; and thirdly whether regardless of the validity and conclusion of the lease agreements in 1997, the Claimant's (indirect) possession of the buildings and structures at the Port would still constitute an investment under the Treaty. The Tribunal will address each of these points in turn.\n\n*(I.) Title-bearing Possession*\n-------------------------------\n\n588.\n\nIf the lease agreements between BPV on the one hand and Agrin and Verest on the other hand were validly concluded, they would arguably constitute (or at least contain) investments under the Treaty. Article I(1)(a)(iii) of the Treaty clarifies that a protected investment can be \"a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment\". The last part of this sentence seems to require a certain link (or association) between the relevant claim and an investment that exists independently of the claim to performance. Given that the Claimant's shares in BPV constitute an investment within the meaning of the Treaty, and that BPV is the lessee under the relevant agreements, the Tribunal is convinced that such a sufficiently close link would exist.\n\n589.\n\nThe decisive issue is whether Agrin and Verest could conclude valid lease agreements regarding the structures and buildings at the Port. The Estonian Courts considered the lease agreements to be invalid because they were in conflict with section 5(1) of the Commercial Lease Act, which reads as follows:\n\n(1) The lessor is the owner or title-compliant possessor of the property to be let. The title-compliant possessor may be the lessor where it is provided for in an Act of the Republic of Estonia, in a contract or in the foundation document of the title-compliant possessor [\u2026]846\n\nThe Rental Act, 1 October 1990, section 5(1) (**CLA-186**).\n\n590.\n\nThe text of this provision makes it clear that the lessor of a property must either be its owner or, according to the translation of the Commercial Lease Act provided by the Claimant, a \"title-compliant possessor\". Instead of \"title-compliant\", the Parties and Mr. Keres use the adjective \"title-bearing\", and the Tribunal adopts this term as well for reasons of consistency. According to the Claimant, the lease agreements concluded by BPV were valid because even if Agrin and Verest were not owners, they were at least title-bearing possessors. In this regard, the Claimant relies on the definition provided by Mr. Keres, who opines that title-bearing possession means \"direct or indirect possession of a thing, which the lessor has acquired by prima facie legal means\".847 The Respondent argues that the term title-bearing possessor is to be equated with the term lawful possessor.\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 104 (**CER-2**).\n\n591.\n\nThe Parties did not submit much jurisprudence or scholarly writings in support of their respective understandings of the term title-bearing possessor. Mr. Keres referred to a decision of the Tallinn Circuit Court of 2010 in support of his view that a possessor qualifies as title-bearing if its possession rests *prima facie* on a legal basis.848 The factual background of that case was as follows. In 1989, the City of Tallinn granted the claimant (O\u00dc Esra Ko, a corporate entity) the right to use what was then a residential building. From 1990 to 1993, the claimant renovated and enlarged the building and turned it into an office building. In 1994, the City of Tallinn issued an administrative decision through which the building was \"returned\" to its original owner, Linda Kruusman (who passed away in 2003 and was the legal predecessor of the defendant, Maire Kruusman). Following this administrative decision, Linda Kruusman leased the building to the claimant through a commercial lease contract concluded in 1995. In 2000, the City of Tallinn annulled its decision of 1994, reasoning that the city\u2014and not Linda Kruusman\u2014was the actual owner of the building (because the building had not been preserved in its original form). In 2007, the Harju County Court confirmed that the City of Tallin is the owner of the building.\n\nCircuit Court of Tallinn, Case No. 2-99-10, 12 March 2010, Judgment (**CLA-193**) (\"**2010 Circuit Court Judgment**\").\n\n592.\n\nThe claimant sued for the repayment of rent paid under the commercial lease contract concluded in 1995, arguing that the contract was void because the lessor, Linda Kruusman, was not the owner of the building. The Tallin Circuit Court dismissed the claim. It held that the contract was valid, given that at the time of its conclusion Linda Kruusman was a \"title-compliant possessor\". While the court did not provide an all-encompassing definition of the term, it emphasized the following points:\n\nSince the legislature has not clarified the contents of the term 'title-compliant possessor,' the Chamber finds that the term must be interpreted in a manner where the property could be let by a direct as well as an indirect possessor. The Chamber finds that at the time of conclusion of the commercial lease contract the defendant was the owner of the property and the indirect possessor of the property and had the right to conclude the commercial lease contract. Possession had been transferred to the defendant on the basis of property delivery report no. 121 made on 1 October 1994 based on order no. 1830-k of the Tallinn City Administration of 24 August 1994. The Chamber finds that the annulment of the administrative decisions after the conclusion of the commercial lease contract and the return of the ownership of the building to the City of Tallinn does not mean that the commercial lease contract concluded by the defendant was void as a result thereof. By the judgment of Harju County Court of 3 April 2007, the ownership of the construction works located at xxx in Tallinn by City of Tallinn was recognized because the administrative decision by which the property was returned had been declared invalid and the court established in its judgment that the defendant had not acquired the property. Nevertheless, the Chamber finds that the defendant was lawfully entitled to let the property owing to the fact that the property was in the defendant's possession. Therefore, the Chamber finds that the commercial lease contract made between the parties on 1 February 1995 was not in conflict with the law or void.849\n\n2010 Circuit Court Judgment, p. 5 (**CLA-193**).\n\n593.\n\nThe Tribunal shares Mr. Keres' view that the judgment supports the proposition that not only direct but also indirect possessors can be title-bearing possessors. Individual sentences of the passage cited above can even be understood to indicate that a title-bearing possessor is anyone who has direct or indirect possession, without the need to fulfill further requirements. But as Mr. Keres rightly noted, this understanding is open to criticism, as possession acquired by theft or fraud would be considered title-bearing.850 More importantly, equating the term \"title-bearing possession\" with \"direct or indirect possession\" would in the view of the Tribunal deprive the term \"title-bearing\" and large parts of section 5(1) of the Commercial Lease Act of any meaning. The provision could then simply read: \"The lessor is the owner or possessor of the property to be let\".\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 101 (**CER-2**); Third Keres Report, \u00b6 \u00b6 83-101 (**CER-4**).\n\n594.\n\nBased on the 2010 Tallinn Circuit Court Judgment, Mr. Keres proposes that, in addition to having direct or indirect possession, a title-bearing possessor must have acquired possession by *prima facie* legal means. In this regard, Mr. Keres distinguishes title-bearing possession from lawful possession, which\u2014according to the Law of Property Act\u2014requires a valid legal basis.851 In the Respondent's view, the two terms are synonymous. Title-bearing possession is, according to the Respondent, a remnant of Soviet law.852 The term lawful possessor, in contrast, became part of Estonian law only with the Law of Property Act of 9 June 1993, and hence after the enactment of the Commercial Lease Act, which remained in force until 1 July 2002.853\n\nSecond Keres Report, \u00b6 102 (**CER-2**); Third Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 83-87 (**CER-4**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 273; Rejoinder, \u00b6 125; Respondent's Answers to Tribunal Question, \u00b6 21. Petrachkov Report, \u00b6 3 (**RER-2**).\n\nThird Keres Report, \u00b6 84 (**CER-4**).\n\n595.\n\nStrong support for the Respondent's position offer, in the view of the Tribunal, the comments made by the Chancellor of Justice before the Parliament on 17 March 1997. The Chancellor of Justice was asked to explain the meaning of the term title-bearing possessor in the Dwelling Act. He stressed that the Commercial Lease Act uses the same term and expressed the view that title-bearing possession means lawful possession. Having put the term title-bearing possessor in historical context, the Chancellor explained that with the definitions of unlawful and lawful possession in section 34 of the Law of Property Act, \"[t]hings have been wrapped up and loose ends tied up\".854 Given that the Chancellor of Justice made those comments more than six months before Estonia initiated proceedings against the Claimant's subsidiaries in an unrelated matter, it seems unlikely that the comments were meant to disadvantage the Claimant or its subsidiaries.\n\nTranscript of the session of Parliament of 17 March 1997, p. 2 (of the English translation) (**RLA-068**).\n\n596.\n\nMr. Keres argues that if title-bearing possession were to mean the same as lawful possession, the Parliament could have changed the wording of the Commercial Lease Act when it enacted the Law of Property Act in 1993.855 In the Tribunal's view, the Parliament's need for clarification of the term \"title-bearing possessor\" in 1997 helps explain why the two terms were not harmonized in 1993. Furthermore, the Tribunal finds it unremarkable that the term \"title-bearing possessor\" remained part of the Commercial Lease Act in the five remaining years of its existence after the Chancellor of Justice's comments in 1997. Undefined terms in statutory texts often remain undefined even after judges, scholars, or others have elucidated their meaning. In addition, considering that the Parties submitted only one judgment and no scholarly article regarding the meaning of the term \"title-bearing possessor\", it seems uncertain whether the Chancellor of Justice's comments were considered as bringing undisputed clarity on this issue.\n\nThird Keres Report, \u00b6 85 (**CER-4**).\n\n597.\n\nAccording to Mr. Keres, the Tallinn Circuit Court shared his opinion in its 2010 Judgment that title-bearing possession means that \"the right to lease must be established in an instrument that appears-to-be valid and legal\".856 The Tribunal is not convinced that the judgment supports the proposition that title-bearing possession exists whenever there is a legal instrument that appears prima facie valid and grants the right to lease. In the 2010 Judgment, it was the City of Tallinn\u2014 that is, the entity that was finally determined to be the *owner* of the relevant building\u2014that issued the administrative act based on which the title-bearing possessor was entitled to lease the building. Requiring that the right to lease must be traced back to an instrument signed or issued by the real owner, as opposed to any third party, also seems to be more in line with the wording of the term \"title-bearing\" (or, in the words of Claimant's translation, \"title-compliant\") possessor. Linda Kruusman was entitled to lease the buildings and structures at the Port through an act of the actual owner, the City of Tallinn. Verest and Agrin, in contrast, derived their alleged rights to lease the buildings and structures at the Port from contracts with B&E and Nautex, respectively, who had never acquired ownership.\n\nThird Keres Report, \u00b6 86 (**CER-4**).\n\n598.\n\nOn balance, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimant's proposition that the lease agreements concluded by BPV with Verest and Agrin were valid because these two entities were title-bearing possessors by virtue of the contracts they had concluded with B&E and Nautex. Rather, the Estonian Court's holding that the lease agreements were invalid because of their incompatibility with section 5(1) of the Commercial Lease Act seems correct.\n\n599.\n\nThe Claimant's argument regarding the principle of *iura novit curia* would be relevant here only if the Tribunal considered Verest and Agrin to have been title-bearing possessors. As set out above, this is not the case. Furthermore, it seems questionable whether the Estonian courts did indeed overlook the concept of title-bearing possession (which not even the Claimant's subsidiaries invoked in the court proceedings). The Tallinn City Court held that the relevant buildings and structures: \"were given to [BPV's] possession by persons who were not the owners and had no other *legal basis* to make transactions with this property. Therefore, the transactions were in contradiction with the Commercial Lease Act in force at the time.\"857 The first sentence seems to mirror the two types of lessors that the Respondent argues are meant in section 5(1) of the Commercial Lease Act, that is, (i) owners and (ii) title-bearing possessors who are nothing else but lawful possessors. Lawful possession is, according to section 34(1) of the Law of Property Act, \"founded on a *legal basis*\", which the Tallinn City Court held was missing as regards Agrin's and Verest's possession of the building and structures at the Port. The fact that the Tallinn City Court did not enter into an in-depth discussion of the meaning of the term title-bearing possessor does not render its conclusions wrong.\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment, \u00b6 18 (**C-078**).\n\n600.\n\nSince the Tribunal finds the proposition that the lease agreements were invalid under Estonian law convincing, it is unnecessary to specify the conditions under which the Tribunal would have felt entitled or obliged to interpret and apply Estonian law differently than the Estonian courts.\n\n*(II.) Other Possessory Rights*\n-------------------------------\n\n601.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Claimant's argument that\u2014even in the absence of title-bearing possession\u2014it held so-called \"possessory rights\" that qualify as investments (within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a)(v) of the Treaty, which provides that the term investment includes \"any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law\"). In this regard, the Claimant relies on Mr. Keres' expert testimony, according to which \"possession is an absolute right\".858 This is because, according to Mr. Keres, even if possession is unlawful, the owner must wait for a court judgment before infringing upon the \"possessor's rights\".859 In support of his proposition, Mr. Keres cites presumptions in the Law of Property Act, according to which possession is lawful and in good faith until the contrary is proved.860 The Tribunal is reluctant to infer from these presumptions that possession constitutes a right under Estonian law (and \"a right conferred by law\" within the meaning of the Treaty). Otherwise, even a stolen asset would constitute an investment within the meaning of the Treaty until a court has determined that the possession is unlawful.\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6 26 (**CER-8**).\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6 26 (**CER-8**).\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6 27 (**CER-8**).\n\n602.\n\nMr. Keres offers no jurisprudence or scholarly writings in support of the proposition that possession is an \"absolute right.\" The Tribunal considers it significant that the Law of Property Act, which contains the presumptions regarding possession quoted by Mr. Keres, explicitly lists the \"rights\" that the act codifies.861 Unlike ownership, servitudes, rights of preemption, and some other rights, possession is not mentioned in this enumeration, as rightly pointed out by the Respondent. The Respondent argues that the possession is not a right but simply a description of a factual relation.862 The Tribunal finds the following characterization of possession by the Tallinn Circuit Court and its distinction from a right to be more accurate:\n\nPursuant to section 34 of the Law of Property Act, possession is lawful if it is based on legal grounds. Possession is not just a fact, but instead is a certain legally regulated relation of the person to the property, a legal relation. On the other hand, possession cannot be considered a right because it is not a property right or a right under the law of obligations or a burdening of the property; also, it cannot be entered into the Land Registry. The owner has the right of claim against anyone possessing the owner's property without legal grounds. The opinion of the plaintiff that possession in good faith or in bad faith can have any meaning only in issues related to recovery of the possession to the owner \u2013 for example, whether and in what scope the owner could have any damage compensation or other compensation claims against the possessor in addition to the recovery of the possession or whether the unlawful possessor could have any damage compensation or other compensation claims against the co-defendants who signed contracts with the possessor without legal grounds, is justified.863\n\n*See supra*, \u00b6\u00b6 278-279.\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 18.\n\nMarch 2006 Appeal Judgment, p. 39 (**C-081**).\n\n603.\n\nThe Tribunal has little to add to this paragraph. It accurately reflects the Tribunal's reading of the relevant statutory texts and is in line with the notions of possession under other civil law systems. Possession is not a right. Nor is good faith possession a right. But whether possession is in good or bad faith is relevant in determining what, if any, monetary claims the owner has against the possessor. Lawful possession means that the owner cannot successfully demand that the possessor return the property during the time in which possession is founded on a valid legal basis, for example, a lease contract. Since the lease agreements were invalid, BPV was not a lawful possessor.\n\n604.\n\nInternational law does not warrant a different assessment. The Claimant argues that the terms of the Treaty must be interpreted autonomously. But given that the Treaty explicitly states that the relevant \"right\" must be conferred by \"law or contract\", the Tribunal finds it inappropriate to detach the meaning of the term \"right\" from the relevant domestic legal system. In any event, the Tribunal is unpersuaded that mere possession is a right under international law. The right to property may (or may not) be a human right. However, this does not mean that unlawful possession by corporate entities is protected under international law.\n\n*(III.) The Authenticity of the Lease Agreements*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n605.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal did not deviate from the Estonian courts' findings that the lease agreements were invalid, and that mere possession is not a right, it is unnecessary to determine whether the lease agreements were, as submitted by the Respondent, backdated.\n\n**d) The JVA**\n--------------\n\n606.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the JVA concluded by Agrin, Verest, and BPV forms an investment under the Treaty.864 Based on the Claimant's submission, the salient feature of the JVA seems to be that it \"allowed BPV to jointly process, manage, use, repair and modernize the Port\".865 The Parties address the JVA foremost with respect to the Claimant's alleged damages. Since the Claimant held the shares in Agrin only until 2001, possible rights of BPV under the JVA might matter, especially when quantifying lost profits from (planned) wood processing activities. For the purposes of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the JVA does not seem to be material. This is because the Tribunal determined above that the Claimant increased its 91% shareholding in BPV to 100% through the SPA dated 20 October 1999. These shares constitute an investment within the meaning of the Treaty. Rights that BPV might hold are therefore protected through the Claimant's shareholding in BPV.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 359. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 484-485.\n\nRespondent's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6 8.\n\n607.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal notes that the JVA mainly contains obligations vis-\u00e0-vis BPV, especially the duty to \"perform and finance all the works\" necessary to \"build a wood processing complex and a modern port.\"866 According to the text of the JVA, the only rights conferred on BPV were the authorization to act as a \"possessor according to the Port Law Article 5\" and \"the right to put up its own buildings.\"867 As determined above, Verest and Agrin were neither owners nor lawful possessors of the buildings and structures at the Port, and the Parties agree that the land did not belong to the Claimant's subsidiaries. Hence, Verest and Agrin could not transfer lawful possession to BPV. Against this background, the Tribunal finds that the JVA is irrelevant for the purposes of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, and it is not necessary to decide whether the JVA was indeed concluded on 21 October 1999 or, as the Respondent argues, backdated.868\n\nJVA, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 (**C-056**).\n\nJVA, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4 (**C-056**).\n\n*See* \u00b6 220 above.\n\n**e) Other Potential Investments**\n----------------------------------\n\n608.\n\nThe Claimant states that it continued to hold \"investments\" in Agrin after BPV had sold its shares in Agrin in 2001. In this regard, the Claimant refers to financing by BPV and \"loans and economic investment in its operations from 2000 to 2006\".869 The Respondent states that it is irrelevant whether BPV held investments in Agrin in the form of loans because the Claimant has not raised any claims based on the loss of such loans.870\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 895, 897.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 440; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 294-300. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 133:11-19.\n\n609.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant made its statements regarding loans (and other \"economic investments\") only in passing and did not substantiate them. Not even the amount of the relevant loans was specified. Therefore, the Tribunal is not convinced that there are any investments within the meaning of the Treaty beyond the Claimant's shares in its subsidiaries that the Tribunal must consider in its subsequent analysis. In any event, the Tribunal does not believe that the existence of such additional investments in the form of loans or other financial contributions in the period from 2000 to 2006 would make a difference regarding the merits of the Claimant's case.\n\n**2. Whether the Claimant's Investments Were Made Illegally and in Bad Faith**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n610.\n\nRegardless of any rights capable of Treaty protection, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's investments were made in violation of domestic laws and regulations and in contravention of court orders.871\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 474.\n\n611.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the requirement that the investments be made and acquired *bona fide* in accordance with the laws of the host State is a general principle of international law accepted by investment tribunals.872\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 32, *referring to Ampal-American Israel Corporation and others v.

Venezuela* found, the Claimant cannot attempt to use the international law principle of estoppel to create property rights that never existed under the applicable municipal law.915 It is the municipal law that has the authority to define the existence and scope of property rights. International law \"only monitors unlawful governmental interference with property rights but cannot create them,916 especially through the concept of estoppel.\"917 For these reasons, the Respondent considers the Claimant's estoppel argument to be \"fundamentally flawed\" and that it should \"be dismissed without substantive inquiry.\"918\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 430-431, *citing Vestey Group Ltd v.

Legal Standard*\n-------------------\n\n633.\n\nThe Parties agree,928 as does the Tribunal, that proof of estoppel requires the following three elements, as proposed by Bowett929 and Kulick,930 that is:\n\na. a clear and unambiguous statement of fact;\n\nb. made voluntarily, unconditionally, and authorized; and\n\nc. relied upon by the other party either to its detriment or to the advantage of the party making the statement.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 462; Rejoinder, \u00b6 433.\n\nD.

It is only in very exceptional circumstances that a holder of a right can nevertheless not raise and enforce the resulting claim.932\n\nD. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, pp. 183-184 (**CLA-024**): \"Representations of a state of fact may be made expressly or impliedly where, upon a reasonable construction of a party's conduct, the conduct presupposes a certain state of fact to exist. Assuming that another party to whom the statement is made acts to its detriment in reliance upon that statement, or from that statement the party making the statement secures some advantage, the principle of good faith requires that the party adhere to its statement whether it be true or not. It is possible to construe the estoppel as resting upon a responsibility incurred by the party making the statement for having created an appearance of fact, or as a necessary assumption of the risk of another party acting upon the statement.\" *See also* Andreas Kulick, *About the Order of Cart and Horse Among Other Things: Estoppel in the Jurisprudence of International Investment Arbitration Tribunals*, EJIL, Vol. 27 No. 1, 2016, p. 109 (**CLA-027**).\n\n*Chevron Corporation (U.S.A.) and Texaco Petroleum Corporation (U.S.A.) v.

The interpretation of the rights and duties of parties of a treaty, however, should lie ultimately with an impartial international tribunal, and it would be wrong to allow the conduct of the parties in interpreting these rights and duties to become a binding interpretation of them.936\n\nJ. Crawford, *Brownlie's Principles of International Law*, (8th ed., 2012), at 422, *cited in* Andreas Kulick, *About the Order of Cart and Horse Among Other Things: Estoppel in the Jurisprudence of International Investment Arbitration Tribunals*, EJIL, Vol. 27 No. 1, 2016, p. 109 (**CLA-027**).\n\nD. W.

In a claim for expropriation contrary to international law, where the property rights concerned are to be determined in accordance with the municipal law of the host State, the international law principle of estoppel cannot be used to create property rights that would not exist under that law. In *Vestey Group Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*,937 the investor argued that in light of the government's prior recognition of its title, Venezuela must be prevented from denying the validity of Vestey's title in the arbitration. The tribunal dismissed that argument:\n\nThe requirements for acquiring property rights over immovable assets situated in Venezuela are governed by specific norms of Venezuelan property law. For a private person to have a claim under international law arising from the deprivation of its property, it must hold that property in accordance with applicable rules of domestic law. The principle of estoppel cannot create otherwise inexistent property rights.938\n\n*Vestey Group Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, \u00b6 257 (**RLA-208**).\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 431, *referring to Vestey Group Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, \u00b6 257 (**RLA-208**).\n\n638.\n\nThe tribunal found that Vestey had acquired the title to the disputed property on other grounds but denied the use of the international law principle of estoppel for the creation of property rights.\n\n*ii. Application to the Facts*\n------------------------------\n\n639.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the Respondent is estopped from objecting to jurisdiction over the expropriation claim on the basis that the Claimant's subsidiaries never acquired title to the buildings and structures at the port. The Claimant specifies this claim as follows:\n\na. \"The impact of estoppel requires Estonia to acknowledge the Claimant's investments and to acknowledge that Estonia expropriated the properties.\"939\n\nb. \"Estonia is estopped from arguing that the Claimant does not have valid title to property. Estonia is also estopped from arguing that it did not expropriate the Claimants' property.\"940\n\nc. \"Estonia is estopped from claiming that the Claimants never had a valid title.\"941\n\nd. \"Estonia is estopped from asserting that the Claimant does not own full property rights.\"942\n\nReply, \u00b6 1468.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1479.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1482.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1484. In other words, according to the Claimant, the assertions which the Tribunal must accept without hearing the Respondent's arguments to the contrary are: that Estonia must \"acknowledge the Claimant's investments\"; that the Claimant has \"valid title to property\"; and that the Claimant owned \"full property rights\".\n\n640.\n\nThe definition of estoppel cited by both Parties requires, first, a representation which, among other qualities, must be one of fact.943 This is recognized as a critical part of the concept of estoppel and a feature that distinguishes it from waiver, recognition, and acquiescence.944 The Tribunal agrees that this distinguishing feature is essential. The representation must be one of fact because the representor is then estopped from contending otherwise, even if the fact may not be true. A representation of law may lead to a similar outcome by way of waiver or admission, but an argument to that effect would fall to be examined on its merits.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 462; Rejoinder, \u00b6 433.\n\nD. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, pp. 188 et seq. (**CLA-024**); Andreas Kulick, *About the Order of Cart and Horse Among Other Things: Estoppel in the Jurisprudence of International Investment Arbitration Tribunals*, EJIL, Vol. 27 No. 1, 2016, pp. 125-127 (**CLA-027**).\n\n641.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the alleged sources of positive reassurance from government officials were opinions on points of law and were unsuitable for an estoppel claim because they do not pertain to facts.945 The Claimant has not shown how the requirement of a representation of fact was met in this case or addressed the Respondent's argument to the contrary.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 442, *referring to* D. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, at pp. 189-190 (**CLA-024**).\n\n642.\n\nThe Claimant pleads that Estonia \"has made many admissions in documents before the local courts in Estonia\";946 \"has recognized the rights and obligations of ELA U.S.A. concerning its investment at the Port and Portlands\";947 and \"has recognized the Claimant as the possessor in multiple instances over a significant period\".948 The Claimant contends that ELA U.S.A. had registered property which had not been challenged prior to the lawsuits;949 that \"Estonia's own officials concluded that ELA USA's local subsidiaries had *bona fide* and legitimate possessory rights\";950 that \"Estonia has recognized the Claimant as the possessor in multiple instances over a significant period.\"951\n\nReply, \u00b6 1476.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1480.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1484.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1481.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1483.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1484.\n\n643.\n\nAs put by the Claimant, the Respondent is estopped from \"arguing\" against the validity of the Claimant's claims. The representations invoked by the Claimant are described as admissions or recognitions. Their subject matter is the contention that the Claimant's claim to title or possession of the Lennusadam Port was valid under Estonian law. This pertains solely to an appreciation of the Parties' respective rights and obligations under Estonian law. The effect to be given to such a \"admission\" or \"recognition\" is for determination under Estonian law. This is a matter for the substantive enquiry into the Claimant's claim to valid title.\n\n644.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, moreover, the Claimant's position amounts to the creation of a proprietary interest, which would bypass the essential exercise of considering the substance of Estonian law on that matter. It is closely comparable to the situation in *Vestey v. Venezuela*952 in that there is no rule of estoppel under Estonian law,953 but the preclusion of the Respondent's objection would amount to a proprietary claim made enforceable against the Respondent by operation of the alleged estoppel.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 431, *referring to Vestey Group Ltd v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016 \u00b6 257 (**RLA-208**).\n\nIn the expert analysis of Mr. Keres, the word \"estoppel\" is mentioned only by analogy, in commenting on the separate issue of legitimate expectations under Estonian law, relation to a rule of good faith which Mr. Keres describes as \"much like estoppel\". *See* Third Keres Report, \u00b6 234 (**CER-4**). The existence of a similar but not identical concept does not suffice: D. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, pp. 189-190 (**CLA-024**).\n\n645.\n\nThe Claimant's argument on this basis is dismissed. The Tribunal notes that conduct or facts that fall short of meeting all of the requirements of an estoppel might still form the basis of a claim in relation to each one of those related concepts, or the formation of legitimate expectations. That question is discussed in the part of this Award addressing fair and equitable treatment.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n646.\n\nIn its Statement of Defense, the Respondent argued that the legal acts that established the Respondent's right of ownership of the Seaplane Harbor were enacted before the Treaty entered into force in 1997, which is why the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the Claimant's claims.954 The Respondent did not repeat this jurisdictional objection in its further submission or at the Hearing, and for good reason, given that all measures that the Claimant argues were in breach of the US-Estonia BIT occurred after the Treaty entered into force in 1997.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n\n**D. Whether the Claimant's Claims are Time-Barred**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n647.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant's claims are inadmissible because the Claimant's claims were filed with an unreasonable delay. The Claimant disagrees, maintaining that there is no applicable time limit to its claims in this dispute and that, in any event, any delay that occurred in bringing its claims was reasonable.\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n648.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's claims are time-barred because they were filed after undue delay.955\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 465.\n\n649.\n\nAs to the permissibility of this objection, the Respondent submits that its time-bar objection pertains to the admissibility of the claim, and therefore Article 21(3) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules did not require the Respondent to raise this objection no later than in its Statement of Defense.956 In the Respondent's view, Article 21(3) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules does not apply because it only concerns pleas relating to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, and not those relating to the admissibility of the claim.957 Moreover, even if the Claimant's undue delay in bringing the claim were a question of jurisdiction, the Respondent contends that its arguments would merely be a further substantiation of the Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction already pleaded in the Statement of Defense.958\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 309.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 309-310.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 310.\n\n650.\n\nTurning to the substance of its time-bar objection, the Respondent submits that both the ICJ and investment tribunals have applied the international principles of acquiescence and extinctive prescription developed under customary international law to determine whether the passage of time renders a claim inadmissible when the relevant treaties are silent on the limitation periods, as is the Treaty in this case.959\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 452-457, 461, *referring to Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v.

The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n660.\n\nPreliminarily, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's time-bar objection is a jurisdictional objection that must be dismissed because the Respondent did not raise it in a timely manner in its Statement of Defense, as required under Article 21(3) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules.981\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 934-936.\n\n661.\n\nTo the extent that the Respondent's time-bar objection is an admissibility objection, which, according to the Claimant, is not subject to the procedure under Article 21(3) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimant likewise contends that the Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proving that the claims are time-barred for the following reasons.982\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 937- 938.\n\n662.\n\nFirst, the Claimant contends that there is no applicable time limitation to its claims under the governing rules in this case, namely the Treaty, the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, international law and any mandatory provisions under Swiss law, the *lex arbitri*. Concerning the Treaty, the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, and Swiss law, the Claimant points out that there exists no express mandatory limitation period for the commencement of claims.983 Relying on *King and Gracie Case* and *Interocean Oil v. Nigeria*, the Claimant maintains that in the absence of an express limitation in the Treaty, which the Claimant argues was a conscious decision of Estonia and the U.S. rather than an omission, there is no legal bar to its claims based on the lapse of time.984\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 949-950.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 944-948, 961, *referring to* 'US v.

Romania* as well as two other cases in which the tribunals determined that no other rules, including the local statute of limitations, applied to the proceedings other than international law.1003\n\nReply, \u00b6 949.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 952-957, *referring to Gavazzi v.

Statutory limitation periods under the law of the host State have on occasion been taken into account by international tribunals in considering periods of delay, including but not limited to limitation periods found in the municipal law applicable to the dispute. In most of the cases invoked by the Parties, tribunals have taken the relevant municipal limitation periods into account, among other factors, without applying them as such.1013 In the single case cited by the Respondent, where a sole arbitrator applied the domestic statute of limitations as such, despite the lack of any limitation provision in the underlying treaty, the Tribunal notes that the relevant claim was based directly on domestic law.1014\n\nReply, \u00b6 967; Rejoinder, \u00b6 317; *Gentini Case*, Italy-Venezuela Claims Commission, RIAA Vol. X, 551, at p. 561 (**RLA-092**); *Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v.

Any applicable time bar is an equitable consideration under international law and relates to the admissibility of the claim rather than the scope of consent to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The rule has been described as one of admissibility, a characterization with which the Tribunal agrees.1029 For these reasons, the Respondent's prescription objection goes to the admissibility of the claim rather than to jurisdiction. The Respondent was therefore not precluded from raising this objection by Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n*Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, pp. 17-18, \u00b6 32 (**RLA-093**).\n\n*i. Period of Delay*\n--------------------\n\n680.\n\nAs to the relevant time period, the Claimant contends that \"aggravating developments\" and ongoing wrongful acts continue to the present day; these circumstances are very different from the *Gentini* case in which the claimant waited with its \"papers ready\" during a three-decade period.1030 The Respondent contends that the new measures taken relate exclusively to the detention of Ms. Kotova and the extradition of Mr. Rotko and are relevant only to the moral damages claim.1031 The Respondent accepts that the moral damages claim would not be time-barred if it is otherwise admissible.1032\n\nReply, \u00b6 991.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 326.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 326.\n\n681.\n\nConcerning the remainder of the Claimant's claims, the Tribunal notes that the criminal proceedings did not preclude or prevent the Claimant from commencing arbitration. The existence of criminal proceedings does bear relevance to the question of whether the delay was reasonable, which is examined below. They have not paused or restarted the period of time that is to be considered as a delay.\n\n682.\n\nAs to that period of time, the domestic litigation concerning the validity of the Claimant's possession became final with the decision of the Supreme Court denying leave to appeal the 2006 Tallinn Judgment, made on 7 June 2006.1033 The Claimant asserted this claim as of 1 August 2017, when it notified the government of Estonia of an investment dispute by letter in connection with the requirement under Article VI(3)(a) that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose.1034 The Tribunal will examine the events and circumstances arising in the interim period.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 197; Supreme Court of Estonia, *Estonia v.

Relevant Events between June 2006 and August 2017*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(I.) Proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights between December 2006 and 26 February/5 March 20081035*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 201, 205, 209. Application for the European Human Rights Court, 4 December 2006, (**C-052**); Letter from Pascale Hecker to European Court of Human Rights regarding application, 30 May 2007, p. 2 (**C-134**).\n\n683.\n\nAfter 7 June 2006, the Claimant made efforts to secure redress from the European Court of Human Rights, which it commenced less than six months after the finality and enforcement of the ownership dispute.\n\n684.\n\nThe human rights complaint was initiated by Verest, Agrin, BPV, and ELA Tolli on 4 December 2006 on the basis of alleged violations of Article 6 (right to a fair trial), Article 14 (prohibition against discrimination), and Article 17 (prohibition against corruption) of the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as Article 1 (right to property) of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.1036 According to the Claimant, this was the only recourse that ELA believed to be available at the time.1037 The European Court of Human Rights declined to hear the case by decision issued on 4 March 2008. It found that the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of were within its competence, did not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols.1038 For this reason, the Court ruled the case inadmissible under Article 28 of the European Human Rights Convention for lack of compliance with the requirements set out in Articles 34 and 35 of the Convention.1039\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 68; Memorial, \u00b6 201; Application for the European Human Rights Court, 4 December 2006, pp. 6-51 (**C-052**).\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 68; Memorial, \u00b6 209; European Court of Human Rights Decision, Application No. 48966/06, 4 March 2008 (**C-212**).\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69; European Court of Human Rights Decision, Application No. 48966/06, 4 March 2008 (**C-212**).\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights Decision, Application No. 48966/06, 4 March 2008 (**C-212**).\n\n685.\n\nThe Claimant was within its rights to seek redress under the European Convention on Human Rights. Even in the absence of financial difficulties, it was reasonable not to commence a BIT claim simultaneously.\n\n*(II.) Financial Difficulties*\n------------------------------\n\n686.\n\nThe Claimant submits that although it has sought to deal with this dispute since 2006, the Respondent's action rendered the Claimant's attempts extremely difficult due to the depletion of corporate financial resources.1040 The Claimant contends that its financial distress was caused by the proceedings to enforce the Supreme Court Judgment and the compensation adjudged to be owed to the Government.\n\nThird Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 438-440 (**CWS-4**).\n\n687.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that following the Supreme Court decision of 7 June 2006, the Claimant and its subsidiaries faced legal actions for enforcement (June-August 2006),1041 damages (December 2006-December 2008),1042 the seizure of assets (January 2007),1043 and insolvency (2008).1044 The record shows, further, that the Claimant's corporate officers were subject to a criminal procedure that commenced on 22 September 2006, in which an extradition request was made in respect of Captain Rotko on 30 January 2013.1045 Mr. Rotko testified that these proceedings, of which he became aware in 2016, cost him all of his savings.1046\n\nEnforcement: Memorial, \u00b6 198, *citing* Agrin Immovable property eviction execution, 19 June 2006, pp. 1-2 (**C-130**); Verest Immovable property eviction execution, 19 June 2006, pp. 1-2 (**C-131**).\n\nDamages: Memorial, \u00b6 202, *citing* Estonia's Statement of Claim against Verest, Agrin, Ela Tolli and BPV, 22 December 2006, pp. 1-13 (**C-135**); Estonia's Petition for Securing the Action, 22 December 2006, pp. 1-5 (**C-136**).\n\nAsset seizure: Memorial, \u00b6 203, *citing* Harju County Court order seizing assets and bank account, 2 January 2007 (**C-205**).\n\nInsolvency: Memorial, \u00b6 212; Reply, \u00b6 1566.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 732, *referring to* Letter from Pascale Hecker to European Court of Human Rights regarding application, 30 May 2007 (**C-134**); Extradition Request, 30 January 2013 (**C-550**).\n\nFourth Rotko Statement, \u00b6 516 (**CWS-5**).\n\n688.\n\nThe Tribunal has no difficulty in concluding that these circumstances caused the Claimant to experience financial difficulties, and is convinced that such difficulties affected the Claimant's ability to act upon its rights.\n\n*(III.) The Claimant's Attempts to Secure Legal Representation and Funding*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n689.\n\nAccording to correspondence provided by the Claimant, in 2007 the Claimant's local counsel in Estonia withdrew its representation.1047 Mr. Rotko contends that he consulted with counsel during the intervening period (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2016)1048 and was unable to secure the necessary legal representation due to lack of funds. Mr. Rotko's queries included seeking representation on a contingency basis, which were also unsuccessful.1049 Mr. Rotko states that this situation changed only in 2016 following the prevalence and development of third-party funding.\n\nMemorial para. 207, *citing* Letter from Pascale Hecker to European Court of Human Rights regarding application, 30 May 2007 (**C-134**).\n\nThird Rotko Statement, \u00b6 447 (**CWS-4**).\n\nThird Rotko Statement, \u00b6 446 (**CWS-4**).\n\n690.\n\nThe Respondent disputes whether those discussions with legal counsel occurred and contends that it would have been easy to prove the fact without breaking legal privilege.1050 The Respondent has not offered evidence to the contrary. Commenting separately on the merits of the Claimant's case, counsel for the Respondent stated: \"I don't have any trouble believing that Mr. Rotko had difficulty finding counsel.\"1051 The Tribunal has no reason to doubt that Mr. Rotko sought legal counsel before obtaining the necessary funding.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 320.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 136:17-18.\n\n691.\n\nConcerning the timing of the Claimant's third-party funding arrangement, Mr. Rotko states: \"it was only in 2016, after the concept of third-party funding was developed and more prevalent in the United States that ELA U.S.A. could bring our case against the Republic of Estonia\".1052 The Respondent contends that \"arbitration financing was available since 2008 at the latest\", which is when the practice of third-party funding of investor-State arbitration commenced.1053\n\nThird Rotko Statement, \u00b6 515 (**CWS-4**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 23.\n\n692.\n\nThird-party funding is a relatively new practice in investor-State arbitration. As of 2019 it remained an industry about which \"little is known\" due to a lack of transparency.1054 Funding of claims is not available as of right. Funders deciding whether to fund an individual case consider factors such as \"the merits of the case; the enforceability of the award against the host-state; its development level, and ability to mount an effective legal team; the potential value of compensation; any adverse costs that may be faced if the claim is unsuccessful; and the expertise of the legal team they will be funding.\"1055 In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that there was no undue delay in Mr. Rotko taking steps to secure third-party funding upon that practice having developed and become more prevalent.\n\nS. Xin Chen, K. Hough, *Researching Third-Party Funding in Investor-State Dispute Settlement*, (GlobaLex, May 2019), p. 5 (**RLA-222**).\n\nS. Xin Chen, K. Hough, *Researching Third-Party Funding in Investor-State Dispute Settlement*, (GlobaLex, May 2019), p. 2 (**RLA-222**).\n\n693.\n\nThe Respondent contends that difficulties in securing funding should not have prevented the Claimant from notifying the Respondent of the existence of a dispute.1056 The Tribunal does not accept this argument. A party intending to commence contentious legal proceedings is entitled and would indeed be well advised to secure adequate legal advice, representation, and resources before engaging in pre-action correspondence.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 23.\n\n*iii. Reasonableness*\n---------------------\n\n694.\n\nAs detailed above, the Claimant was faced with a series of challenging circumstances in the form of legal proceedings, asset seizure, lack of financial resources, and a lack of legal advice and representation. It is logical to suppose that any party facing such actions would need to expend resources to exercise its legal rights therein. The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant's financial difficulties did not result from its own negligence. The Claimant was within its rights to pursue redress from the European Court of Human Rights and to await the outcome of those proceedings before commencing arbitration. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the actions of the Claimant in the relevant period of delay were not unreasonable.\n\n*iv. Prejudice*\n---------------\n\n695.\n\nThe Tribunal must next consider whether prejudice would be occasioned to the Respondent. The Respondent argues that since the deadline for preserving accounting records is 7 years under Estonian law, a claimant must at least bring a claim \"well ahead\" of that time.1057 The Respondent contends that it is prejudiced by the fact that the detailed books and records of the relevant Estonian companies \"have most likely been destroyed\" and that the failure to preserve the necessary evidence for this arbitration is the Claimant's responsibility.1058 The Respondent submits in particular that it has been prejudiced because the signatories of the handover protocol by which the Seaplane Harbor property and buildings were handed over to the Respondent in 1994 have passed away or cannot be identified by the Ministry of Defense or the Estonian War Museum.1059 It states: \"These are just a few examples of how the passage of more than two decades from the events relevant to the claim\" causes it prejudice, but does not detail further examples.1060\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 462.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 463.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 464, *referring to* Handover Protocol of Military Camp 22, 15/20 February 1994 (**R-055**); Therium Litigation Funding website extract, obtained 13 July 2021 (**R-237**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 464.\n\n696.\n\nThe Claimant points to the fact that in the Interim Measures motion before this Tribunal, the Respondent relied upon the availability of civil and criminal court files.1061 According to the Claimant, difficulties in maintaining evidence are not ELA's responsibility.1062\n\nRespondent submission of 12 November 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, *cited in* Reply, \u00b6 1011.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1014.\n\n697.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the record pertaining to the Claimant's dispute is found \"in large part\" in the documents and evidence filed in the civil court proceedings No. 2/23-7262 (2-02-270)1063 and No. 2-06-39447.1064 It is uncontentious in this connection that the civil court files \"must be \u2013 and will be \u2013 preserved indefinitely\".1065 Nor is there a dispute as to the availability of the framework of laws and regulations relevant to the dispute at the material times.\n\nMarch 2006 Appeal Judgment (**C-081**).\n\nEstonia's Statement of Claim against Verest, Agrin, Ela Tolli and BPV, 22 December 2006 (**C-135**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 1011, *citing* Response to Motion for Interim Measures, \u00b6 24-25, fn. 15-16, *citing Marco Gavazzi and Stefano Gavazzi v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/25, Decision on Jurisdiction Admissibility and Liability, 21 April 2015 (**RLA-207**).\n\n698.\n\nIn relation to the series of transactions by which the possession of the Lennusadam Port changed hands, each Party relies primarily on the face of the record. In any event, it is not clear which issues, if any, would turn upon the circumstances in which the handover protocol of 15/22 February 1994 was concluded, such that it would be prejudicial not to hear the evidence of its signatories. The handover protocol of 15/22 February 1994 is mentioned only once more in the written pleadings, in the Respondent's narration of the facts.1066\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 134.\n\n699.\n\nThe Respondent adds that much of the Claimant's evidence is uncorroborated witness testimony, and states that whether prejudice will be caused to it depends on the Tribunal's view on the burden of proof.1067 The burden of proof prescribed by Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules states: \"Each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defense.\" It follows from this rule, from which this Tribunal has not been mandated to deviate, that the Claimant is assigned the burden of proof in proving its claims. The absence of documentary evidence in support of the Claimant's case does not prejudice the Respondent.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 323.\n\n700.\n\nThe Tribunal is not satisfied that the Respondent has been prejudiced by delay in relation to this claim.\n\n701.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's objection based on prescription.\n\n**E. Whether the Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction over Moral Damages**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n702.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over a claim for moral damages for the alleged human rights violations and the resulting distress suffered by the Claimant's corporate officials. The Claimant disagrees, maintaining that its claim for moral damages is connected to the Claimant and its investments.\n\n**1. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n703.\n\nWith reference to *Biloune v. Ghana Investment Centre*, the Respondent contends that a claim alleging a violation of the human rights of an investor, let alone any other individual, cannot proceed under the Treaty as it does not relate to the rights of the investor conferred or created by the Treaty with respect to an investment.1068\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 447, *referring to Biloune v. Ghana Investments Centre*, UNCITRAL (*ad hoc*), Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 27 October 1989, p. 203 (**RLA-091**).\n\n704.\n\nThe Claimant's claim for moral damages in this arbitration, the Respondent continues, involves the personal rights of the Claimant's corporate officials in connection with a criminal case that commenced in September 2006, *i.e.*, after the investment was allegedly expropriated.1069 For the Respondent, such claim for moral damages falls outside the scope of its consent to arbitrate disputes arising from an investment under Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.1070\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 445, 448, 718; Rejoinder, \u00b6 305. *See also* Counter-Memorial, fn. 406.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 445-446, 451; Rejoinder, \u00b6 307.\n\n705.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the alleged human rights violations during the criminal proceedings arise from measures directly against individuals only \"linked to\" the Claimant rather than against the Claimant or the investment itself.1071 Accordingly, in the Respondent's view, the rights of Mr. Rotko and Ms. Kotova are \"personal and distinct\" from those of the Claimant, and the Respondent is, therefore, under no obligation to compensate for the harm suffered by two individuals, neither of whom is a party to this arbitration.1072\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 450. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 141:6-15.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 450; Rejoinder, \u00b6 308.\n\n706.\n\nThe Respondent further underscores that Mr. Rotko's extradition proceedings and Ms. Kotova's detention were \"completely avoidable\" only if they engaged with the pending criminal proceedings, which they were fully aware of in 2007.1073 Rather, they \"chose to ignore it.\"1074\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, pp. 140:20 \u2013 141:5.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 141:5.\n\n**2. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n707.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Claimant asserts that the issue of moral damages is not a question of jurisdiction.1075\n\nReply, \u00b6 908.\n\n708.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal has the authority to consider its claim for moral damages on the grounds that the incorporeal harm alleged is (i) connected to the Claimant or its investments in Estonia and (ii) caused by the Respondent's actions or at its direction and control in order to \"denigrate and harm the reputation of [ELA] and its corporate officials and advisors.\"1076 Specifically, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's expropriation of the investments in breach of the Treaty, the actions taken by Government officials to harm the reputation of ELA Corporate Group and its officers, as well as Estonia's request to extradite Mr. Rotko from the U.S., form a solid basis for the Tribunal to address its moral damages claim, which the Claimant has substantiated with both documentary and medical evidence.1077\n\nReply, \u00b6 909.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 908-914.\n\n709.\n\nIn support of its claim, the Claimant notes that it is not uncommon in investment arbitrations for a claimant to be awarded moral damages on account of physiological suffering and stress suffered by its corporate officials and the loss of reputation caused by the conduct of the respondent State. Therefore, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's contention that any damage suffered by ELA's officers constitutes personal injury and is separate from the damage suffered by ELA.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**a) Legal Standard**\n---------------------\n\n710.\n\nThe Tribunal's jurisdiction to hear any moral damages claim is circumscribed by the terms of the US-Estonia BIT. The scope of Estonia's consent to arbitration under Article VI(4) of the US-Estonia BIT extends only to any \"investment dispute\", such being defined in Article VI(1) as:\n\na dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to:\n\n(a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company;\n\n(b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or\n\n(c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n711.\n\nThe US-Estonia BIT thus does not provide for claims for the violation of human rights as an independent cause of action.\n\n712.\n\nThis important distinction was considered in the *Biloune v. Ghana Investments Centre* case.1078 The investors asserted that compensation for a human rights violation could be required in a commercial arbitration and that their claim should be considered because the tribunal was the only forum in which redress could be sought. The tribunal accepted that a State is required by customary international law to accord foreign nationals within its territory a standard of treatment no less than that prescribed by international law, and that contemporary international law recognized the entitlement of all individuals to fundamental human rights. This did not render the tribunal \"competent to pass upon every type of departure from the minimum standard to which foreign nationals are entitled,\" or \"authorized to deal with allegations of violations of fundamental human rights.\" Acts alleged to violate international human rights could be relevant in considering the investment dispute under arbitration. However, in circumstances where the host State had agreed to arbitrate only disputes \"'in respect of' the foreign investment,\" the tribunal held that \"other matters \u2013 however compelling the claim or wrongful the alleged act\" were outside its jurisdiction.\n\n*Biloune v. Ghana Investments Centre*, UNCITRAL (*ad hoc*), Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 27 October 1989, p. 203 (**RLA-091**).\n\n713.\n\nDamages for breaches of international law have not been confined to material losses. Non-material damage, as summarized in the commentary to Article 36 of the ILC Draft Articles, \"is generally understood to encompass loss of loved ones, pain and suffering as well as the affront to sensibilities associated with an intrusion on the person, home or private life.\"1079\n\nReply \u00b6 1571, *referring to* Int'l Law Commission Draft Articles of State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries, Vol. II, Part Two, 2001, Commentary on Article 36, at \u00b6 16, **(CLA-126**).\n\n714.\n\nClaims for compensation of non-material damage were upheld, for example, in the 1905 *Fabiani* case, in relation to bankruptcy, loss of prestige, pain, and suffering arising from \"repeated denials of justice.\"1080 In the 1923 *Lusitania* case, the position under international law was stated as follows:\n\nThat one injured is, under the rules of international law, entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation, there can be no doubt, and such compensation should be commensurate to the injury. Such damages are very real, and the mere fact that they are difficult to measure or estimate by money standards makes them none the less real and affords no reason why the injured person should not be compensated therefore as compensatory damages, but not as a penalty.1081\n\n*Antoine Fabiani* Case (Venezuela \u2013 Italy Mixed Commission decision 1905), p. 62 (**CLA-353**).\n\n*Lusitania* Cases, 7 R.I.A.A. 32, 40 (1923), p. 40 (**CLA-140)**), p. 40.\n\n715.\n\nIn investor-State claims, tribunals ruling on damages, having found a breach of the investment treaty concerned, have recognized or awarded monetary compensation for \"moral damages\", \"intangible losses\", or \"dommage moral\".1082 In *Desert Line Projects LLC v. Yemen,* while the host State had not questioned the possibility for the Claimant to obtain moral damages in the context of the ICSID procedure, the tribunal stated as follows:\n\nEven if investment treaties primarily aim at protecting property and economic values, they do not exclude, as such, that a party may, in exceptional circumstances, ask for compensation for moral damages. It is generally accepted in most legal systems that moral damages may also be recovered besides pure economic damages. There are indeed no reasons to exclude them.1083\n\n*V\u00edctor Pey Casado v.

Libya and others*, Final Arbitral Award, 22 March 2013, pp. 368-369 (**CLA-142**). In one such case, the tribunal had been empowered to decide *ex aequo et bono* but did not invoke this as an express basis for its reasoning on moral damages: *S.A.R.L. Benvenuti & Bonfant v. People's Republic of Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/77/2, Award, 8 August 1980, \u00b6\u00b6 2.3, 4.44, 4.65, 4.96 (**CLA-354**).\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v.

An exceptionally high threshold of seriousness or gravity must be met before moral damages claims are upheld on their merits. The investor must establish an unbroken chain of causation between the treaty breach and the moral injury.1085 Whether the breach of the rights of a corporate claimant would incur liability for moral harm to individual executives who are not parties to the arbitration would depend on the facts of the case. These questions pertain to the merits of a claim for moral damages and do not further limit the tribunal's jurisdiction beyond a requirement to establish a breach of the treaty.\n\n*Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine (II)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Award, 28 March 2011, \u00b6 157 (**RLA-150**).\n\n**b) Application to the Facts**\n-------------------------------\n\n718.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that by reason of the facts and matters which it claims amount to breaches of the US-Estonia BIT, ELA and its corporate officers suffered reputational harm,1086 and ELA's corporate officers further suffered psychological and emotional harm due to harassment, intimidation, expatriation from Estonia, and concerns for their personal safety.1087\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 575-581.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 591-597.\n\n719.\n\nAs was the case in *Biloune v. Ghana*, this Tribunal has not been given jurisdiction over a claim for moral damages or the violation of human rights norms as an independent cause of action. It has not been empowered to decide any aspect of the case *ex aequo et bono.* There is no prior admission or agreement establishing the Respondent's liability for any of the Claimants' claims.\n\n720.\n\nThe Claimant accepts that it is necessary to demonstrate unlawful actions taken by the State.1088 The Tribunal's jurisdiction to award relief for moral harm depends, more specifically, on whether it finds any \"breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment\". Non-compliance with norms other than the protections conferred by the US-Estonia BIT would not be sufficient.\n\nReply, \u00b6 910.\n\n721.\n\nConsistently with this rule, in the decisions cited by the Claimant in which moral damages were awarded, such damages formed part of the relief for liability that had been admitted1089 or upheld.1090 Likewise, in *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile*, the tribunal upheld claims of denial of justice and breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard before considering appropriate relief for the resulting moral injury.1091 In *Arif v. Moldova* and *Lemire v. Ukraine*, each tribunal had found a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard before it engaged in assessing the substance or gravity of the moral harm caused.1092\n\n*Lusitania* Cases, 7 R.I.A.A. 32, 40 (1923), p. 40 (**CLA-140**).\n\n*Antoine Fabiani* Case (Venezuela \u2013 Italy Mixed Commission decision 1905), 10 R.I.A.A, 83 (**CLA-353**); *S.A.R.L.

The Republic of Yemen*, ICSID No. ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008, (**CLA-029**); *Mohammed Al-Kharafi & Sons v.

Republic of Moldova*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/23, Award, 8 April 2013 (**RLA-193**).\n\n722.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the dictum of the tribunal in *Desert Line* that \"[e]ven if investment treaties primarily aim at protecting property and economic values, they do not exclude, as such, that a party may, in exceptional circumstances, ask for compensation for moral damages.\"1093 This does not alter the rule that the US-Estonia BIT protects exclusively the rights of the investors and only such rights that arise directly out of the investment.\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v. The Republic of Yemen*, ICSID No. ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008, \u00b6 289 (**CLA-029**).\n\n723.\n\nJurisdiction over moral damages would not be excluded because the claimed harm had been suffered by Mr. Rotko and Ms. Kotova, who are individual corporate officers of ELA U.S.A. and are not parties to the arbitration. Such harm was not excluded, for example, in *Desert Line Projects LLC v. Yemen*, where the claimant's executives were not parties to the case but were found to have suffered stress, anxiety, and harm to their physical health arising out of the treaty breach.1094 Non-material loss to a corporate investor or its executives of the type alleged in this case rest within the purview of damages that this Tribunal could award, should the Claimant establish a breach of \"rights of investors\" or \"rights arising directly out of the investment\". The relationship of individual moral injuries to the treaty rights of ELA U.S.A. would form part of the Tribunal's analysis on liability, as would the causal relationship with the alleged treaty breach and the seriousness of the harm.\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v. The Republic of Yemen*, ICSID No. ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008, \u00b6 290 (**CLA-029**).\n\n724.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal considers that it would not be precluded from considering moral harm caused to the Claimant or its corporate officers, such as deprivation of liberty, injury to health, fear for personal safety, the need to change the country of residence, or loss of reputation, in assessing damages for any breach of the US-Estonia BIT. Whether or not any breach of the US-Estonia BIT is established is, however, a question of the merits.\n\n**VI. MERITS**\n--------------\n\n725.\n\nIn its findings on jurisdiction, the Tribunal has held that the Claimant's only investments within the meaning of Article I(1)(a)(iii) of the Treaty were its shares in BPV and, indirectly, in Verest and Agrin. Before turning to the merits, the Tribunal must address the question of whether the Claimant's investments are protected from State measures that are not directed against its shares, but rather against the companies in which it held shares.1095 There is widespread consensus in arbitral jurisprudence that a \"cut-off point\" exists after which an indirect shareholder is too far removed from its investment to claim protection under a treaty.1096 But there is significant uncertainty on where exactly this cut-off point lies. Relevant factors include the number of layers between the investor and the relevant investment, that is, the company directly affected by the State measures, as well as the level of control the investor can exercise over that company.\n\n*See El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Legal Opinion of M. Sornarajah, 5 March 2007, \u00b6 10 (**RLA-055**).\n\n*Noble Energy Inc. and MachalaPower C\u00eda. Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 5 March 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 80-82 (**RLA-012**).\n\n726.\n\nHere, the Claimant was the direct or indirect majority or sole shareholder of BPV (from 1997 until 2011), Verest (from 1999 until 2010), and Agrin (from 1999 to 2001).1097 Furthermore, the Claimant has substantiated how it controlled the economic activities performed by its subsidiaries either directly or through one intermediary, that is, BPV. Against this background, the Tribunal does not consider the connection between the Claimant and its subsidiaries to be too remote for the Treaty to offer protection against measures affecting those subsidiaries.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 370, 373, 374.\n\n727.\n\nWith these observations in mind, the Tribunal now turns to the standards of protection invoked by the Claimant.\n\n**A. Articles II(3) & (7) of the Treaty: Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n728.\n\nArticle II, in paragraphs (3) and (7), of the Treaty provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n3. (a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than required by international law.\n\n(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purpose of dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a Party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n7. Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investment, investment agreements, and investment authorizations.\n\n729.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent violated its obligations under paragraphs (3) and (7) of Article II to accord its investments fair and equitable treatment, including by frustrating the Claimant's legitimate expectations, impairing the Claimant's investments through arbitrary and discriminatory measures, corrupt practices and unlawful interfering in the judicial process, and denying the Claimant an effective means of asserting its claims in relation to its investment. The Respondent denies the Claimant's claims in their entirety.\n\n**1. Art. II(3)(a) \u2013 Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n730.\n\nThe Claimant, alleging a violation of Article II(3)(a), invokes the doctrines of estoppel and legitimate expectations as protections under the FET standard.1098\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 461-473; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1467-1472.\n\n**a) The Content of the FET Standard**\n--------------------------------------\n\n*i. The Claimant's Position*\n----------------------------\n\n731.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty requires the Respondent to accord protected investors FET treatment.1099 This standard, the Claimant asserts, is not equivalent to the one articulated in the *Neer* case.1100 While the Respondent has relied on this authority in its submissions, the Claimant contends that tribunals have rejected the application of the *Neer* standard, considering *inter alia* that there has been an evolution in customary international law since the 1920s, when the award in that case was rendered.1101\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 378-379; Reply, \u00b6 1143.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1138-1142, *referring to Neer v.

The Respondent's Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n734.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's claim under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty should be rejected as: (i) \"the Claimant has not established that it had any legitimate expectations;\" (ii) \"the Respondent afforded the Claimant due process and acted in a reasonable and justified manner;\" and (iii) \"the claims for corruption and unlawful interference are simply not substantiated.\"1110\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 525.\n\n735.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the FET standard provided for in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty is equivalent to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.1111 This is evidenced, the Respondent asserts, by the express reference in Article II(3)(a) to the treatment \"required by international law.\"1112 The Respondent further relies, in this regard, on the explicative letter from the United States' Secretary of State to the President before the ratification of the Treaty and the award in *Genin v. Estonia*.1113\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 526-531; Rejoinder, \u00b6 352.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 526-527; Rejoinder, \u00b6 352.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 528-529*, referring to* Letter of Submittal from Warren Christopher, Department of State, to William J.

Mexico (II)*.1114 That tribunal defined the minimum standard of treatment as treatment that would not be \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, [] discriminatory and expose[] the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involve[] a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.\"1115 Under the mentioned standard, the Respondent contends, a \"simple 'unreasonableness' is not sufficient\" to establish a breach of the FET standard.1116 Rather it is required to prove \"a more pronounced degree of misdoing\" such as \"serious malfeasance, manifestly arbitrary behavior or denial of justice causing apparent harm and damages to the claimant.\"1117 Moreover, the Respondent contends that, to establish a breach of the FET standard, \"there must be a causal link between the action and the damage.\"1118\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 531, *referring to Waste Management, Inc. v.

The Tribunal's Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n738.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges the Parties' submissions on the content of the FET standard. It is nonetheless not persuaded that the outcome of the case hinges on the question of whether the US-Estonia BIT includes an autonomous FET standard or only provides the protection offered by an international minimum standard of treatment.\n\n739.\n\nThe Claimant's submissions in favor of an autonomous treaty standard are supported by an analysis of the terms of the US-Estonia BIT as per Article 31(1) VCLT. The language of Article II(3)(a) points first to an autonomous FET treaty standard, second to full protection and security, and only third to an international treatment standard, serving as the minimum threshold:\n\nInvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than required by international law.1121\n\nBIT, Article II(3)(a).\n\n740.\n\nNonetheless, as put forward by the Respondent, other elements suggest that the international minimum standard applies instead. In particular, the Letter by Warren Christopher, Secretary of State, addressed to the U.S. Senate states that Article II(3) \"sets out a minimum standard of treatment based on customary international law.\"1122 Even though this statement offers support to the Respondent's position, it is doubtful whether this clarification relates to the whole paragraph or simply to the third standard indicated therein. Further, the Tribunal finds that this statement can only bear little weight, as a unilateral statement made after the conclusion of a treaty does not fall into any of the means of interpretation provided by Articles 31 and 32 VCLT.\n\nLetter of Submittal from Warren Christopher, Department of State, 7 September 1994 (**R-157**).\n\n741.\n\nA similar interpretation would also be supported by the precedent of *Genin v. Estonia*\u2014the only case on file involving the US-Estonia BIT\u2014 in which the tribunal found the FET standard \"to require an 'international minimum standard' that is separate from domestic law, but that is, indeed, a *minimum* standard.\"1123 While this test is indeed reminiscent of the *Neer* standard, the tribunal in *Genin v. Estonia* also noted that there is no general consensus on the content of the FET standard.\n\n*Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. The Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award, 25 June 2001, \u00b6 367 (**RLA-126**).\n\n742.\n\nOn balance, the Tribunal is persuaded by neither argument. It finds, instead, that no differentiation is necessary between these two standards. In *Azurix v. Argentina*, the FET provision of the relevant BIT\u2014the United States-Argentina BIT\u2014contained the same formulation as the clause at issue here, namely that:\n\n[i]nvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, -- and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.1124\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, 14 July 2006, \u00b6 324 (**CLA-072**)\n\n743.\n\nThe *Azurix* tribunal found that the reference to a minimum standard under customary international law was merely intended as a floor under which the provision could not be interpreted. Regardless, the tribunal finally stated that:\n\nthe minimum requirement to satisfy this standard has evolved and the Tribunal considers that its content is substantially similar whether the terms are interpreted in their ordinary meaning, as required by the Vienna Convention, or in accordance with customary international law.1125\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, 14 July 2006, \u00b6 361 (**CLA-072**).\n\n744.\n\nLikewise, the tribunal in *Rumeli Telekom AS v. Kazakhstan* reasoned that the distinction between an autonomous FET standard and the international minimum standard of treatment \"is more theoretical than real\"1126 and that, like other several ICSID tribunals, it found no material differences between the two.1127\n\n*Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Award, 2008 WL 4819868, 29 July 2008, \u00b6 611 (**CLA-076**).\n\n*See Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, \u00b6 592 (**CLA-073**); *Saluka, Investments B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Partial Award, 2006 WL 1342817, 17 March 2006, \u00b6 291 (**CLA-069**).\n\n745.\n\nUltimately, the Tribunal is more persuaded by the quoted investment jurisprudence. It agrees that this distinction is more perceived than material, and that it would, in any case, not lead to a different result.\n\n**b) Estoppel**\n---------------\n\n*i. The Claimant's Position*\n----------------------------\n\n746.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, in accordance with the international law principle of estoppel, which \"arises from the principle of good faith, which is protected by Article II of the Treaty and its [FET] obligation,\" the Respondent is estopped from arguing that the Claimant has no valid title to the Seaplane Harbor and that it did not expropriate the Claimant's property.1128\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1468-1469, 1479. *See also* Memorial, \u00b6 431.\n\n747.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, this international law principle, which has been applied by various international tribunals,1129 requires parties to act consistently with their prior actions.1130 In particular, according to the Claimant, estoppel applies when the following conditions are met, namely, if the respective party: (i) made a clear and unambiguous statement of fact; (ii) made the statement voluntarily, unconditionally, and authorized; and (iii) relied in good faith upon the statement either to the detriment of the party so relying on the statement or to the advantage of the party making the statement.1131\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 438-440, *referring to ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

The Respondent's Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n752.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that estoppel does not apply in respect of claims under the FET standard,1144 rather, it is mainly applicable in the relations between States and has been applied by arbitral tribunals only in the context of jurisdictional issues.1145 Further, the Respondent argues, as the tribunal in *Vestey v. Venezuela* found, the Claimant cannot attempt to use the international law principle of estoppel to create property rights that never existed under the applicable municipal law.1146 For these reasons, the Respondent considers the Claimant's estoppel argument to be \"fundamentally flawed\" and that it should \"be dismissed without substantive inquiry.\"1147\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 538.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 538.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 430-431, *citing Vestey Group Ltd v.

Yemen*, ICSID Arb/05/17, \u00b6\u00b6 119-120, 207 (**CLA-029**).\n\n755.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it acted to its detriment by relying on the Respondent's representations.1154 This is because the Respondent in fact made no admissions and representations to the Claimant, and the Claimant has not evidenced any reliance on the Building Register notices, the letter from the advisor of the Chancellor of Justice, or the letter from the official of the State Chancellery to its detriment.1155\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 449.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 450-451.\n\n*iii. The Tribunal's Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n756.\n\nThe doctrines of estoppel and of legitimate expectations are both expressions of the principle of good faith under international law. By precluding one from contradicting itself after its statement or conduct has induced another into detrimental reliance, both doctrines are corollaries to good faith obligations as they prohibit *venire contra factum proprium*.1156\n\nJames Crawford, *Brownlie's Principles of International Law*, (Edition 8th, 2012), p. 234 (**CLA-023**); *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, 2006 WL 247692, UNCITRAL, Separate Opinion of Thomas W\u00e4lde, 1 December 2005, \u00b6 27, fn. 30 (**CLA-094**). *See also* Bin Cheng, *General Principles of Law as applied by International Courts and Tribunals*, (1953), p. 144 (**CLA-020**).\n\n757.\n\nHowever, their applications by international tribunals differ. Estoppel, originally an equitable common law doctrine,1157 has found its application under international law in State-to-State disputes, many of which concern territorial issues. Crawford warned that estoppel must be approached with caution.1158 Similarly, Kulick describes estoppel as it developed and established in the Permanent Court of International Justice and ICJ jurisprudence.1159 By contrast, estoppel is rarely raised under the merits of investment arbitration decisions,1160 and its use is deemed \"inconsistent\"1161 by Kulick. In accordance with this application of estoppel under international law, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent's statement1162 in that estoppel mainly applies to disputes between sovereign States and is not the appropriate legal standard for an alleged FET breach.\n\nEnglish Exchequer Court in *Hurlstone & Norman*, England, Court of Exchequer: Cave v. Mills, February 1862, p. 747 (**CLA-021**): \"[\u2026] a man shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold \u2013 to affirm at one time and deny at another \u2013 making a claim on those whom he has deluded to their disadvantage, and founding that claim on the very matters of the delusion. Such a principle has its basis in common sense and common justice, and whether it is called \"estoppel,\" or by any other name, it is one which Courts of law have in modern times most usefully adopted.\"\n\nJames Crawford, *Brownlie's Principles of International Law*, (Edition 8th, 2012), p. 236 (**CLA-023**): \"Resting on good faith and the principle of consistency in state relations, estoppel may involve holding a government to a declaration which in fact does not correspond to its real intention, if the declaration is unequivocal and the state to which it is made has relied on it to its detriment. Such a principle must be used with caution, more particularly in dealing with territorial issues.\"\n\nAndreas Kulick, *About the Order of Cart and Horse Among Other Things: Estoppel in the Jurisprudence of International Investment Arbitration Tribunals*, EJIL, Vol. 27 No. 1, 2016, pp. 110-112 (**CLA-027**).\n\nAndreas Kulick, *About the Order of Cart and Horse Among Other Things: Estoppel in the Jurisprudence of International Investment Arbitration Tribunals*, EJIL, Vol. 27 No. 1, 2016, p. 113 (**CLA-027**): \"Of all 53 decisions, [\u2026] 12 decisions raised the subject of estoppel at the merits stage.\"\n\nAndreas Kulick, *About the Order of Cart and Horse Among Other Things: Estoppel in the Jurisprudence of International Investment Arbitration Tribunals*, EJIL, Vol. 27 No. 1, 2016, p. 128 (**CLA-027**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 538.\n\n758.\n\nThe Tribunal is also persuaded that the doctrine of legitimate expectations constitutes the proper standard applicable to the Claimant's FET claims under the US-Estonia BIT. Investment tribunals have generally considered that the FET standard enshrines the substantive protection of an investor's legitimate expectations.1163 Further, while the Parties disagree on the applicability of estoppel, it remains undisputed that legitimate expectations are protected by the FET standard.1164\n\nJames Crawford, *Brownlie's Principles of International Law*, (Edition 8th, 2012), pp. 617-618 (**CLA-023**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 386; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 539.\n\n759.\n\nNevertheless, even if estoppel were an applicable standard in this case, its strict test requirements would not be met. As established by ICJ jurisprudence, estoppel requires a strict test, only successful in exceptional circumstances and when all its elements are present.1165 As undisputed between the Parties and agreed by the Tribunal, such test is composed of a clear and unambiguous statement of fact; made voluntarily, unconditionally, and authorized; and relied upon by the other party either to its detriment or to the advantage of the party making the statement.1166\n\nD. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, p. 188 (**CLA-024**); Andreas Kulick, *About the Order of Cart and Horse Among Other Things: Estoppel in the Jurisprudence of International Investment Arbitration Tribunals*, EJIL, Vol. 27 No. 1, 2016, pp. 111-122 (**CLA-027**): \"the Court has confirmed this clear and unequivocal endorsement of the strict view of estoppel as has been done in most of public international law scholarship.\" *See also* p. 125 (**CLA-027**): \"Admittedly, all decisions of investment arbitration tribunals \u2013 and, in fact, all ICJ decisions of the last few decades \u2013 explicitly embracing the strict view have rejected an estoppel claim.\"\n\n*See* V.B.3.c)i.\n\n760.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that the Respondent's statements could not amount to an *unambiguous* statement of fact. As stated by Bowett, such a requirement must be evaluated in light of the statement's context and history:\n\nThis much is apparent from the estoppel cases, that a tribunal will not take a phrase out of its context and upon that isolated phrase create an estoppel: on the contrary, the tribunal will review the whole circumstances and the background of diplomatic negotiation and correspondence even for a period of thirty years prior to the hearing of the case as it did in the Russian Indemnity case.1167\n\nD. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, p. 189 (**CLA-024**) *referring to* Scott, Hague Court Reports, p. 297 at p. 325.\n\n761.\n\nHaving regard not only to the Claimant's allegations regarding estoppel but also to the wider background of the facts of the case and their time span, the Tribunal is convinced that the Respondent did not take a sufficiently unambiguous and clear position at any point in time to meet the high threshold that would be required for estoppel.1168\n\nD. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, p. 189 (**CLA-024**): \"unless and until the meaning of the representation is clear, there is no justification for binding one or other of the parties to that meaning.\"\n\n762.\n\nDespite the failure of any hypothetical estoppel test, the Tribunal recognizes the underlying principle of the estoppel doctrine, namely that *allegans contraria non audiendus est*.1169 Such a principle, that a State cannot blow hot and cold, is once again better expressed in investment arbitration by the legitimate expectations doctrine, to which the Tribunal turns in the next section.\n\nD. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, pp. 195-196 (**CLA-024**).\n\n763.\n\nThose representations for which the Claimant invoked estoppel will therefore not be considered as binding, but rather as evidence under the legitimate expectations test. According to Bowett, if a statement lacks an element of estoppel, it retains nonetheless \"a certain probative value\"1170 and may as such be evaluated by the Tribunal as indicative of the inconsistency of the entity making it:\n\nWhere one or other of the foregoing essentials of a binding estoppel is absent the representation, whether by words or conduct, does not lose all value for, although lacking conclusive effect, it may still be adduced in evidence as an admission to show a lack of consistency or weakness in a party's position.1171\n\nD. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, p. 202 (**CLA-024**).\n\nD. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, p. 195 (**CLA-024**).\n\n764.\n\nFurther, the Claimant itself did not clearly outline which representations it submitted as an element of estoppel and which as giving rise to legitimate expectations. By stating that \"[w]hether it be under the banner of estoppel or legitimate expectations, it is clear under international law that Estonia should not now be able to seize ELA's investment,\"1172 the Claimant implied the equivalency of an analysis of said representations under either doctrine for the purposes of its FET claims. The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the statements adduced by the Claimant do not produce any binding effects on the Respondent but are to be evaluated merely as evidence for its legitimate expectations claims.1173\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 471. *See* Memorial, \u00b6 461 (emphasis added): \"Estonia failed to act in a fair and equitable manner 1. Estonia should be *estopped* from taking ELA's investment after creating a *legitimate expectation* that private parties owned the Port.\" *See also* Reply, \u00b6 1472.\n\nD. W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, British Yearbook Int'l Law 176, Vol. 33, 1957, p. 196 (**CLA-024**): \"the answer lies in ascertaining whether the statement fulfils the essential conditions of an estoppel. If it does not, then, although denied binding effect, it can still be adduced as evidence to weaken the case which the party making the statement or admission now puts forward.\"\n\n**c) Legitimate Expectations**\n------------------------------\n\n*i. The Claimant's Position*\n----------------------------\n\n765.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent frustrated its legitimate expectations that its Estonian subsidiaries had private rights in the Seaplane Harbor buildings, in violation of the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.1174\n\nReply, \u00b6 1233.\n\n766.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the FET standard protects a qualifying investor's legitimate expectations, which \"can arise from a variety of sources\" such as from explicit or implicit assurances by the host State.1175 In particular, the Claimant submits that investors may legitimately expect that a host State would (i) provide an appropriate investment environment;1176 and (ii) act consistently \"without arbitrarily revoking any pre-existing decisions or permits issued by the State that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments.\"1177 The Claimant refers to *TECMED v. Mexico*, *MTD v. Chile*, *Bilcon v. Canada* and *Occidental v. Ecuador* as instances in which arbitral tribunals have concluded that inconsistencies in the treatment of an investment or investors were contrary to the obligation to provide FET treatment.1178 Additionally, the Claimant acknowledges that in order to enjoy the protection of its legitimate expectations, an investor must show that it exercised due diligence and that its legitimate expectations were reasonable in light of the circumstances.1179\n\nReply, \u00b6 1204, *referring to Azurix Corp. v.

The Tribunal's Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n*(I.) Legal Standard*\n---------------------\n\n781.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the legitimate expectations doctrine, as developed in the case law of investment tribunals under the FET standard,1216 can be generally defined as the protection from frustration of an investor's legitimate expectations as arising from a host state's representations.\n\nMichele Potest\u00e0, *Legitimate expectations in investment treaty law: Understanding the roots and the limits of a controversial concept*, 28 ICSID Review (2013), p. 2 (**CLA-254**).\n\n782.\n\nThe Parties, however, present two diverging standards under which state acts or conducts may qualify as representations in this sense. The Claimant's assertion that official government records and, more generally, a state's publicly stated positions constitute such representations1217 is too broad of an interpretation. Likewise, the Respondent's view that any expectations must be based on specific commitments made by competent government officials to induce an investment1218 is far too narrow. The Tribunal is rather convinced that the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes. It suffices to say that while a certain degree of specificity is required to constitute such a representation,1219 any other requirements are left to a second stage of the analysis, to which the Tribunal will revert if necessary.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 263-270; Reply, \u00b6 1216; Reply, \u00b6 1402 *quoting Total S.A. v.

Otherwise, they could not possibly serve as the basis for its expectations.1222\n\n*ECE Projektmanagement v. The Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2010-5, Award, 19 September 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 4.762 (**RLA-132**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 543; Reply, \u00b6 1204.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medio ambientales, TECMED S.A. v.

In the most chaotic moments of the history of a country, \"the presumably greater instability will be indeed part of the business risk\"1227 taken by those seeking a higher return on their investments. As was the case in *Bayindir v. Pakistan*, reasonableness must be evaluated in light of the investor's full awareness of \"a degree of political volatility.\"1228 Similarly, in *Parkerings v. Lithuania*, the tribunal held that:\n\nthe political environment in Lithuania was characteristic of a country in transition from its past being part of the Soviet Union to candidate for the European Union membership. Thus, legislative changes, far from being unpredictable, were in fact to be regarded as likely. As any businessman would, the Claimant was aware of the risk that changes of laws would probably occur after the conclusion of the Agreement. The circumstances surrounding the decision to invest in Lithuania were certainly not an indication of stability of the legal environment. Therefore, in such a situation, no expectation that the laws would remain unchanged was legitimate.1229\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 544 *quoting RLA-128 Invesmart, B.V. v. Czech Republic*, Award, 26 June 2009, \u00b6 250 (**RLA-128**).\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, \u00b6 391 (**CLA-262**).\n\nMichele Potest\u00e0, *Legitimate expectations in investment treaty law: Understanding the roots and the limits of a controversial concept*, 28 ICSID Review (2013), pp. 35-36 (**CLA-254**).\n\nMichele Potest\u00e0, *Legitimate expectations in investment treaty law: Understanding the roots and the limits of a controversial concept*, 28 ICSID Review (2013), p. 37 (**CLA-254**).\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009, \u00b6 195 (**RLA-142**).\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS* v. *Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, \u00b6 335 (**CLA-123**).\n\n786.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal is persuaded that expectations may be reasonable only when they account for the critical situation existing at the place and time of the investment. While a State must act fairly even during transitional periods, it would be unreasonable to expect the same level of stability from a state in transition as from an established economy.\n\n787.\n\nThe requirement of due diligence demands that an investor actively structure its investment \"in order to adapt it to the potential changes of legal environment.\"1230 The tribunal of *Parkerings v. Lithuania* also held that the investor should have sought to protect its investment at the negotiation stage by inserting more stringent provisions in the contract it concluded with the state.1231 Similarly, this Tribunal is persuaded that due diligence must be exercised before and in the making of the investment. Any investor failing to exercise care at that stage could hardly complain that its expectations were disattended.\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS* v. *Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, \u00b6 333 (**CLA-123**).\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS* v. *Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, \u00b6 336 (**CLA-123**).\n\n788.\n\nFrustration constitutes the final element of the legitimate expectations doctrine. As the FET standard requires a balancing exercise between the legitimate interests of investors and those of a State to regulation and policy,1232 its breach must meet a high standard. Frustration is something more than a mere inconsistency or deviation from the law in the conduct of a state. Rather, it occurs \"only when a State's acts or procedural omissions are, on the facts and in the context before the adjudicator, manifestly unfair or unreasonable.\"1233 The Tribunal acknowledges this important distinction and is persuaded that, in its balancing exercise, it must consider the scale of the breach. As stated in *Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic*:\n\nA violation of a BIT does not only occur through blatant and outrageous interference. However, a BIT may also not be invoked each time the law is flawed or not fully and properly implemented by a state. Some attempt to balance the interests of the various constituents within a country, some measure of inefficiency, a degree of trial and error, a modicum of human imperfection must be overstepped before a party may complain of a violation of a BIT. Otherwise, every aspect of any legislation of a host state or its implementation could be brought before an international arbitral tribunal under the guise of a violation of the BIT. This is obviously not what BITs are for.1234\n\nMichele Potest\u00e0, *Legitimate expectations in investment treaty law: Understanding the roots and the limits of a controversial concept*, 28 ICSID Review (2013), pp. 40-41 (**CLA-254**).\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Award, 23 September 2010, \u00b6 9.3.40 (**RLA-192**).\n\n*Eastern Sugar B.V. v Czech Republic*, SCC Case No. 088/2004, Partial Award, 27 March 2007, \u00b6 272 (**CLA-266**).\n\n789.\n\nIt follows then that not every failing, imperfection, inconsistency or inadequacy can amount to frustration.1235 Rather, in line with the purpose of BITs, to breach the FET standard, a state must disattend at a fundamental level the expectations legitimately held by foreign investors.\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f6m\u00fc Kft v Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Award, 23 September 2010, \u00b6 9.3.40 (**RLA-192**). *See also* Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi v.

Application to the Facts*\n--------------------------------\n\n790.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider, having regard to their date, specificity, and content, whether the statements and conducts of the State amount to representations, as alleged by the Claimant. Then, it will examine if any expectations arising therefrom are reasonable and the result of due diligence. Finally, the Tribunal will consider whether any legitimate expectations were frustrated.\n\n791.\n\nGiven the findings as to jurisdiction, the relevant time of the making of Claimant's only investments under the US-Estonia BIT \u2013 the share purchases of Verest and Agrin \u2013 is respectively 23 September and 8 December 1999. Only the acts which were known by the Claimant at those points in time will be considered as the possible bases for its expectations. Nonetheless, the Tribunal's analysis would remain unchanged even if it considered the circumstances present in 1997, as proposed by the Claimant,1236 because the critical elements at the basis of this reasoning would remain the same.\n\nReply, \u00b6 195.\n\n792.\n\nAs to the content of expectations, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's governmental acts generated expectations to property rights, to lawful possession, and to the continuity of the acts and facts of the occupation.1237 However, the Tribunal must disregard those acts which do not pertain to the Claimant's investments as found under the jurisdictional section. Considering then that the lease agreements were invalid, and that mere possession is not a right, the Tribunal will only acknowledge those acts which were at the basis of the Claimant's share purchase of Verest and Agrin.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 264, 304, 443; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1231-1233.\n\n793.\n\nSimilarly, regarding the requirement of specificity, the Tribunal will consider as specific only those acts which point directly to ownership or to another title, and not to mere factual control of a property.\n\n*(A.) The Representations*\n--------------------------\n\n794.\n\nThe Claimant has summarized the critical government acts which are the basis for its expectations in a \"six-pack\"1238 which the Tribunal will address in order: the Port Passport, the Privatization Letter, the Legal Chancellor Letter, the Building Register's acts, the Building Permits, and the Tax Department's acts. Further, in the context of its estoppel claims, the Claimant has also submitted the Customs Authorization and the Planning Office Certificate as grounds for expectations which were allegedly disattended.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 60:6-9: \"These six acts were the basis upon which ELA USA had legitimate expectations about possession. We call them a 'six-pack.'\" *See also* Claimant's Opening Slides, p. 14.\n\n*(1.) The Port Passport*\n------------------------\n\n795.\n\nThe Port Passport is dated 7 October 1993.1239 The Claimant adduces it as one of the bases for its expectations to the ownership of the Port as it \"showed that the Port had been under private ownership since 1991.\"1240 Namely, the Claimant argues that the Port Passport shows that \"the Estonian Maritime Administration registered Verest as the new owner.\"1241\n\nLennusadam Port Passport, 7 October 1993 (**C-201**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 466.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 466(a).\n\n796.\n\nHowever, the letter and the function of the Port Passport indicate otherwise. First, Verest is listed as \"Possessor of the port\", \"Possessor\" of Berths 38A, 38 and 39, as well as \"possessor\", jointly with AS Esman and AS GT-Projekt, of the Open Warehouse and of the Closed Warehouse.1242 Secondly, the Claimant itself describes the Port Passport as \"giv[ing] its holder the right to run the port, direct ships, transmit on certain radio frequencies to maritime shipping,\"1243 without any implications as to its ownership. While at the time it was issued port passports were unregulated, the Estonian Maritime Agency was nonetheless gathering technical information on the ports previously possessed by the Soviet military and issuing \"port certificates\".1244 Years later, in section 11(1) of the Port Act adopted on 22 October 1997, a port passport would similarly be defined as \"a document which proves that a port complies with the norms established by legislation and is open for safe shipping and port operations\"1245 and therefore merely certifies the safety of the facility.\n\nLennusadam Port Passport, 7 October 1993, pp. 1, 5, 6 (**C-201**).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 60, 18-20.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 181 *referring to* Letter of Estonian Maritime Administration to Tallinn Administrative Court, 13 June 2002 (**R-098**).\n\nPort Act, 22 October 1997 (**C-604**).\n\n797.\n\nOn balance, the Tribunal is persuaded that the Port Passport does not constitute a representation because there is no correlation between the right of ownership and the right to run a port as its possessor. No expectations could therefore be formed on the basis of the Port Passport.\n\n*(2.) The Estonian Privatization Agency*\n----------------------------------------\n\n798.\n\nThe Claimant also submits as bases for its expectations the correspondence between the Estonian Privatization Agency and the Tallinn City Government from 1996 concerning the issue of ownership and privatization of the Seaplane Harbor.1246 It also submits the legal instruments issued by the Estonian Privatization Agency to Verest and B&E from 1997 concerning the procedure of land privatization of K\u00fcti 17 and 17a.1247\n\nLetter from Tallinn City Government to Ministry of Defense and to Estonian Privatization Agency, 26 April 1996 (**C-308**); Letter from Estonian Privatization Agency to Tallinn City Government, 27 May 1996 (**C-309**); Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 61-62:24-6.\n\nResolution of the Administrative Board of the Northern District of Tallinn, 1 October 1997 (**C-356**); Tallinn Ownership Reform Office Legal Instrument No. 195, 3 October 1997 (**C-446**); Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 61:15-23.\n\n799.\n\nThe correspondence with the Tallinn City Government, despite taking place certainly before the making of the Claimant's investment, constituted an internal government communication. As argued by the Respondent,1248 those letters could not have been known by the Claimant because they constituted an exchange to which it was not privy. As the Claimant did not make any statements nor presented any evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal must assume that the Claimant did not know of the correspondence before the making of its investment. No expectations could therefore be formed on the basis of the Tallinn City Government's letter.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 199; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 119:1-3: \"the Claimant wasn't privy to the letters that we've just discussed before investing in the harbour\". *See also Invesmart B.V. v. Czech Republic*, Award, 26 June 2009, \u00b6 253 (**CLA-234**).\n\n800.\n\nThe legal instruments issued by the Estonian Privatization Agency constitute respectively a proposal and an order concerning the boundaries and the taxable value of the land subject to the privatization process. It is undisputed between the Parties that the ownership of the buildings above the land was a requirement for its privatization,1249 but the preliminary instruments in question do not point to ownership, as admitted by Mr. Rotko.1250 Further, as rightly argued by the Respondent, the abstract possibility of obtaining privatization could not in itself be ground for expectations. Especially so if less than one month after the instruments were issued, the Tallinn City Court put an end to the privatization process with an interim order.1251 Therefore, the Tribunal must conclude that at the time of the making of the investment in 1999, the Claimant could not possibly rely on an unfinished administrative procedure as a basis for its expectations.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 194; Third Rotko Statement, \u00b6 223 (**CWS-4**).\n\nThird Rotko Statement, \u00b6 252 (**CWS-4**): \"The plot borders for both Kuti 17 and Kuti 17a were approved, with Verest and B&E identified as the possessors.\"\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 195-199.\n\n*(3.) The Legal Chancellor Letter*\n----------------------------------\n\n801.\n\nThe Claimant relies on a letter sent by the Office of the Legal Chancellor to B&E on 23 October 1997 that the Respondent produced during the document production process.1252 The one-paragraph letter reads as follows:\n\nAs assigned by the Chancellor of Justice I hereby clarify in response to questions posed in your letter that the [23 January 1992 Resolution] did not possess retroactive effect. Said resolution cannot be relied on when requesting that transactions performed in 1990 be declared null and void.1253\n\nLetter from the Advisor of Chancellor of Justice to B&E, 23 October 1997 (**C-331**).\n\nLetter from the Advisor of Chancellor of Justice to B&E, 23 October 1997 (**C-331**).\n\n802.\n\nBased on this letter (and the letter of the Privatization Office), the Claimant argues that it had the expectation that Estonia would \"follow the instruments issued by the Office of the Legal Chancellor\" and be \"in lawful possession of the Lennusadam Port\".1254 The letter was sent after the alleged conclusion of the lease agreement but before the purchase of Agrin and Verest through BPV in 1999, which is the relevant point in time for determining the Claimant's expectations.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1223, 1233.\n\n803.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether the Claimant was aware of the letter prior to its production by the Respondent in the document production process. Mr. Rotko testifies in his Third Witness Statement that he saw the letter and that he and his advisors concluded from it that Estonia could not claim ownership of the properties transferred by B&E to Agrin on 26 September 1997.1255 The Respondent does not find this testimony credible and states that there is no evidence to confirm Mr. Rotko's statement that he had even seen the letter.1256\n\nThird Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 217, 221, 222.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 189-190.\n\n804.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider it necessary to decide whether the Claimant has successfully established that Mr. Rotko has seen the letter or not. This is because the letter simply replies to a query presented by B&E on 22 October 1997 on whether the 23 January 1992 Resolution could retroactively apply to transactions concluded before the resolution was enacted. The Office of the Legal Chancellor replied in the negative, with the single paragraph quoted above. It is common ground between the Parties that the 23 January 1992 Resolution does not apply retroactively. Nor did the Estonian courts, in the view of the Tribunal, rely on this resolution in their decisions that Estonia is the owner of the buildings and structure as the Seaplane Harbor. But as correctly pointed out by the Respondent,1257 the letter does not state that transactions could not be invalid for other reasons, nor does it recognize the ownership or lawful possession of B&E. On this basis, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Legal Chancellor letter is not sufficiently specific and therefore does not amount to a representation that could create expectations of ownership or lawful possession by the Claimant.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 189-191.\n\n*(4.) The Building Register*\n----------------------------\n\n805.\n\nThe Building Register notices were issued between 1994 and 2003 under respectively file number 20215 for K\u00fcti 17 and file number 8395 for K\u00fcti 17a.1258\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 466(c); Reply, \u00b6 277; Rejoinder, \u00b6 170; Respondent's Opening Slides, p. 40.\n\n806.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider all in its analysis, with the exception of the notice dated 29 January 2003, as it was issued after the making of the investments.1259 On this point, the Respondent alleges that the notices were not known by the Claimant at the time of the investment, but rather \"discovered retroactively and used by the Claimant to justify the expectations it did not actually hold.\"1260 The Tribunal acknowledges that while there is no record of the Claimant consulting the notices, it may well have done so, as the Building Register was accessible to \"companies, entities, and organizations and even individuals\"1261 and Mr. Rotko declared to have seen it.1262 The Tribunal will therefore assume that the Claimant was aware of the Building Register notices at the relevant time.\n\nBuilding Registry Certificate No. 154 to Agrin, 29 January 2003 (**C-102**).\n\nTranscript, Day 1, pp. 115-116:25-1.\n\nThird Keres Report, \u00b6 162 (**CER-4**) *referring to* Order No. 378-k of the Government of the Republic of Estonia, 20 December 1990 (**RLA-069**).\n\nThird Rotko Statement, \u00b6 223 (**CWS-4**).\n\n807.\n\nAs to the purpose of the Building Register and its notices, the Parties agree, also on the basis of Mr. Keres' opinion, that it was not constitutive of rights.1263 The Tribunal agrees, but is likewise convinced that the Building Register operated as a public source of reliable information during Estonia's transition.1264 Further, even though the Building Register coexisted with the Land Register when the relevant notices were issued, and must have therefore had a different function, the Building Register was according to its establishing Order \"a component of the Republic of Estonia construction information system.\"1265 As such, the Tribunal cannot ignore the Building Register notices as a possible source of expectations and must therefore turn to their content.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 303-304; Rejoinder, \u00b6 177; Third Keres Report, \u00b6 189 (**CER-4**).\n\nThird Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 189-190 (**CER-4**). *See also* Order No. 378-k of the Government of the Republic of Estonia, 20 December 1990, \u00b6 2 (**RLA-069**).\n\nOrder No. 378-k of the Government of the Republic of Estonia, 20 December 1990, \u00b6 4 (**RLA-069**). *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 175.\n\n808.\n\nUnder file number 20215, the Building Register notices indicate Verest as having \"right of ownership\" without any further annotations on 20 April 1994, on 5 September 1995, on 27 October 1995, and on 8 July 1996.1266 Verest was also identified as the owner in the notices dated 21 November 1996, 17 November 1997, and 22 June 1998, but with annotations indicating respectively that \"the buildings [had] been included in the balance sheet of the State Prison Board\"1267 and in the other two that the \"property was used by the armed forces of the former USSR until 17 August 1991.\"1268 Instead, the only notice indicating the ownership of Estonia is dated 21 June 1994 and reads that \"pursuant to the 18 May 1993 act of the Republic of Estonia regarding the assets of the former USSR armed forces, it belongs to the Republic of Estonia\" but is used by Verest.1269\n\nTallinn Building Registry Certificate No. 20215 issued to Verest, 20 April 1994 (**C-028**); Statement No. 20215, 5 September 1995 (**C-319**); Statement No. 20215, 27 October 1995 (**C-320**); Tallinn Building Registry Certificate No. 20215 issued to Verest, 8 July 1996 (**C-030**).\n\nStatement No. 20215, 21 November 1996 (**C-322**).\n\nTallinn Building Registry Certificate No. 20215 issued to Verest, 17 November 1997 (**C-053**);

Tallinn 8395 issued to B&E, 8 December 1995 (**C-034**); Tallinn Building Registry Statement No. 8395, 21 November 1996 (**C-312**); Tallinn Building Registry Statement No. 8395, 9 June 1997 (**C-315**).\n\nTallinn Building Registry Certificate No. 8395 issued to B&E, 21 November 1996 (**C-035**).\n\nTallinn Building Registry Statement No. 8395, 9 June 1997 (**C-314**).\n\nCertificate No. 8395 of Tallinn Building Register issued to O\u00dc B&E, 16 September 1996 (**C-036**).\n\nTallinn Building Registry Statement No. 8395, 27 October 1998 (**C-317**).\n\n810.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that not all notices are consistent. The Respondent is therefore correct in arguing that such inconsistent information should have given rise to rigorous due diligence to ascertain any defects in title,1275 and the Tribunal will revert to this point. Even so, all but one of the notices point to an owner other than the Respondent and all but one refer to the contracts with which the Claimant alleges that K\u00fcti 17 and 17a were transferred to private owners.1276 Further, even though the annotations suggest that the right of ownership could be disputed or uncertain, the owner is indicated as a private entity in 15 out of 16 notices. On balance, the Tribunal is therefore persuaded that the Building Register notices overall constitute representations which point with sufficient specificity to the private ownership of K\u00fcti 17 and 17a. In a second stage of the analysis, the Tribunal will consider whether such representations could give rise to legitimate expectations and whether these were frustrated.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 173.\n\n*See* Sale Agreement between Nautex and Verest, 7 May 1992 (**C-027**); Contract No. 16 (**C-023 / R-036**). *See also* Transcript, Day 1, p. 64, 1-3: \"the buildings of the port and the port lands were registered to private entities, not in the name of the state.\"\n\n*(5.) The Administrative Permits*\n---------------------------------\n\n811.\n\nThe Claimant adduces various administrative permits issued to its subsidiaries between 1999 and 2000 as a basis for its expectations, arguing that they confirm both rightful possession and private ownership.1277\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 64:13-25: \"All of these permits were issued to private entities; they were not issued to the state. The Building Department knows who owns what [\u2026] they are the people who have rightful possession. That's why they have the permits.\" *See also* Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 252-260.\n\n812.\n\nThe Tribunal must first exclude from its analysis the permits which were issued after the making of the investment, as they could not possibly have created any expectations in the Claimant. The Tribunal will therefore disregard the permits issued on 17 December 1999, 28 July 2000, and 25 October 2000.1278 Upon closer inspection, also the permits dated 1st and 24 November 1999 were issued after the making of the investment.1279 These permits allowed dredging work in the Seaplane Harbor's port basin, which was under the possession of Verest, which in turn had already been acquired by BPV on 23 September 1999. The Tribunal must therefore conclude that none of the administrative permits submitted by the Claimant were issued before the making of its investment and that none could constitute a representation capable of creating legitimate expectations.\n\nEstonian Marine Inspectorate Permit No. 25 to BPV, 17 December 1999 (**C-092**); Estonian Marine Inspectorate Permit No. 48 to BPV, 17 December 1999 (**C-093**); National Heritage Board of Tallinn issued Permit No. 85, 28 July 2000 (**C-095**); National Heritage Board Permit No. 130 to Verest, 25 October 2000 (**C-096**).\n\nEstonian Marine Inspectorate Permit No. 41 to BPV, 1 November 1999 (**C-089**); Estonian Marine Inspectorate Permit No. 47 to BPV, 24 November 1999 (**C-091**).\n\n*(6.) The Tax Instruments*\n--------------------------\n\n813.\n\nThe Claimant also adduces the Respondent's acceptance of tax payments as a basis for its expectations and, in particular, it submits several tax notices and instruments concerning the taxable value of the disputed properties.1280 Referring to these exhibits, the Claimant asserts that \"Tallinn issued orders naming the owner and user of the land and describing the plot of land taxed.\"1281\n\nTax and Customs Board notice to Agrin, 19 October 2006 (**C-195**); Tax Notice to Verest for payment of Land Tax, 19 October 2006 (**C-203**); Tallinn Instrument of the Taxable value of a plot of land, Number 70438 issued to B&E, 22 December 1999 (**C-325**); Tallinn Instrument of the taxable value of Kuti 17a issued to Agrin, 23 January 2002 (**C-327**); Tallinn Instrument of the taxable value of Kuti 17 issued to Verest, 18 January 2000 (**C-328**); Tallinn Instrument of the taxable value of Kuti 17a issued to B&E, 18 January 2000 (**C-329**); Tallinn Instrument of the taxable value of Kuti 17 issued to Verest, 22 January 2003 (**C-354**); Tallinn Instrument of the taxable value of Kuti 17 issued to Agrin, 22 January 2003 (**C-355**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 338.\n\n814.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant's statement. It finds, instead, that B&E and Verest are referred to as \"Owner/superficiary/user,\"1282 Verest and Agrin as \"land taxable person,\"1283 or again as merely the addressees of the tax instruments, without any further qualifications.1284 While the Tribunal acknowledges that the Tax Department recognized Verest and Agrin's use of the disputed properties, nothing in the aforementioned exhibits points to ownership with sufficient specificity.\n\nTallinn Instrument of the taxable value of Kuti 17 issued to Verest, 18 January 2000 (**C-328**); Tallinn Instrument of the taxable value of Kuti 17a issued to B&E, 18 January 2000 (**C-329**).\n\nTallinn Instrument of the taxable value of Kuti 17 issued to Verest, 22 January 2003 (**C-354**); Tallinn Instrument of the taxable value of Kuti 17 issued to Agrin, 22 January 2003 (**C-355**).\n\nTax and Customs Board notice to Agrin, 19 October 2006 (**C-195**); Tax Notice to Verest for payment of Land Tax, 19 October 2006 (**C-203**); Tallinn Instrument of the Taxable value of a plot of land, Number 70438 issued to B&E, 22 December 1999 (**C-325**); Tallinn Instrument of the taxable value of Kuti 17a issued to Agrin, 23 January 2002 (**C-327**).\n\n815.\n\nFurther, all submitted tax notices and instruments are dated after the Claimant made its investments on respectively 23 September and 8 December 1999, so they could not have possibly been the basis for its expectations. The Tribunal must therefore disregard them.\n\n*(7.) Customs Authorization*\n----------------------------\n\n816.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Estonian Customs Board's approval of Verest's application to use the Lennusadam Port for the import and export of wood would have implicitly recognized B&E, Agrin, and Verest as owners of the port.1285\n\nReply, \u00b6 1486, *referring to* Verest application for permit of import-export cargo through port Lennusadam, 26 July 1994 (**C-040**).\n\n817.\n\nHowever, the document presented by Claimant only includes the application, and not the actual approval. Even if as alleged by the Claimant, the application was later approved, such a response could not be considered a recognition of ownership, as it merely asked the competent authority to recognize the Seaplane Harbor as \"as a port that carries out hydro-technical works and processes imported-exported goods\",1286 whereas no statement was made as to ownership. The Claimant has therefore failed to demonstrate that the Estonian Customs Board made a representation as to its ownership of the Lennusadam Port.\n\nVerest application for permit of import-export cargo through port Lennusadam, 26 July 1994 (**C-040**).\n\n*(8.) Planning Office Certificate*\n----------------------------------\n\n818.\n\nThe Claimant adduces the Certificate issued by the Tallinn Sustainable Development and Planning Office to Verest in 1997 as \"recognizing its use of the Lennusadam Port.\"1287\n\nReply, \u00b6 1486, *referring to* Tallinn City Planning Office Certificate about the scope of building right and use, 21 August 1997 (**C-041**).\n\n819.\n\nThe Tribunal finds, however, that the Certificate simply provides building restrictions for detail planning proceedings for K\u00fcti 17.1288 Even though its full name reads \"Certificate about scope of building rights and intended purpose\", the document in question does not mention, or for that matter recognize, Verest as owner of the site. Rather, it merely states that a detailed plan needs to be prepared for the lot at K\u00fcti 17.1289\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 342.\n\nTallinn City Planning Office Certificate about the scope of building right and use, 21 August 1997 (**C-041**).\n\n820.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Planning Office Certificate is not sufficiently specific and therefore does not amount to a representation which could possibly create expectations in the Claimant.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n821.\n\nConsidering the above, the only representation made to the Claimant by the Respondent amounts to the Building Register notices, which represented, with sufficient specificity and before the making of the investment, the Claimant as the owner of the disputed property.\n\n*(B.) Legitimacy and Reasonableness*\n------------------------------------\n\n822.\n\nThe tribunals in the cases of *Bayindir v. Pakistan* and *Parkerings v. Lithuania* found that the reasonableness and legitimacy of expectations must be evaluated in light of the historical circumstances at the time and place of investment, and the Tribunal agrees with this proposition. As well put by the Respondent, there was a high degree of instability, especially concerning private and public ownership, in the years preceding the Claimant's investment:\n\nThe process of land reform and privatization in Estonia following the restoration of independence was complex; there was no concept of land ownership in the Soviet Union; the system had to be built from scratch and account for the rights of the state, the newly formed municipal entities, and the pre-occupation owners of land.1290\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 193.\n\n823.\n\nIn this context, the Claimant's reliance on so few and inconsistent representations from the Building Register was unreasonable, especially when so many other representations pointed to the contrary. The overwhelming number of adverse representations would have made most if not all investors wary of the elevated risk of their investments in a country that was emerging from decade-long Soviet occupation and re-establishing land ownership. Instead, the Claimant ignored Estonia's position as to the disputed properties, including clear stances such as *inter alia* the initiation of the court proceedings, the Tallinn Master Plan, the heritage restrictions, and the early attempts to reclaim the Seaplane Harbor as municipal ownership.1291 It was clear long before 1999 that its ownership was disputed and that the Respondent was actively trying to re-establish it.\n\nLetter from Tallinn City Government to Ministry of Defense and to Estonian Privatization Agency, 26 April 1996 (**C-308**); Tallinn City Development Plan 1994-1997, 5 May 1994 (**R-122**); Letter No. 620 from National Heritage Board to State Executive Office and to Verest, 11 July 1996 (**R-112**).\n\n824.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal is not convinced that extensive due diligence that resulted in conclusions later contradicted by the reasonable assessment of the Estonian authorities could have given rise to legitimate expectations by the Claimant. But, in any event, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant did not establish that an appropriate level of due diligence was performed. Apart from the unspecific claim by Mr. Rotko that appropriate due diligence took place, there is little, if any, evidence on file that would corroborate this allegation disputed by the Respondent. The privilege log indicates that two communications with counsel took place before the making of the investment.1292 But the Claimant chose not to disclose the content of these communications, and there is no record of other professional advice. The Claimant may well be within its rights not to disclose the content of the advice it received prior to making its investment because of attorney-client privilege. But this does not relieve the Claimant from its burden of proof. It is undisputed that Mr. Rotko was aware of the court proceedings and that, nonetheless, he proceeded with the purchase of Verest and Agrin in 1999.1293 Proper due diligence would have revealed critical deficiencies or at least uncertainties in the chain of title of K\u00fcti 17 and 17a.\n\nClaimant's Privilege Log, 30 June 2020 (**R-201**).\n\nFirst Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34 (**CWS-1**); Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 199:10-15.\n\n825.\n\nConsidering the above, the Tribunal finds that, in making its investment, the Claimant took on a business risk whose materialization is not protected by the legitimate expectations doctrine.\n\n*(C.) Frustration*\n------------------\n\n826.\n\nBecause of the Tribunal's finding above that the expectations the Claimant alleges to have had were not legitimate, it is unnecessary to analyze whether those expectations were frustrated. But the Tribunal doubts whether the inconsistencies in Estonia's behavior did indeed amount to the frustration of any expectations.\n\n**2. Art. II.(3)(b) \u2013 Impairment by Arbitrary and Discriminatory Practices**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n827.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the Respondent also breached the prohibition of arbitrary and discriminatory measures under Article II(3)(b) of the Treaty.1294\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 474-486.\n\n828.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, many of the Respondent's measures at issue in this arbitration were not based on reason, but on prejudice toward the Claimant because its owner and employees were Russian-speaking and of Russian heritage.1295 The Claimant maintains that as a result of the five-decade-long occupation of Estonia by the USSR, a majority of the Estonian population has \"antagonistic feelings\" towards Russian-speaking Estonians.1296 This is evidenced, the Claimant asserts, by the fact that the media reports that covered events related to the present dispute emphasized that the companies involved were controlled by Russian speakers.1297 The Claimant underlines that following a visit to the Seaplane Harbor, the President of Estonia stated that he \"found a large scaled state theft in the area of the seaplane hangar [\u2026] by self-appointed Russian thieves.\"1298\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 476. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, p. 70:12-16.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 477, *referring to* Ryo Nakai, \"The Influence of Party Competition on Minority Politics: A Comparison of Latvia and Estonia\", Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe, 13(1), 2004, p. 62 (**C-272**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 478-479, *referring to* Rask Started Disciplinary Proceedings Against Judge, Baltic News Service, 20 November 2000 (**C-072**); Laar Confirms that the Conflicting Seaplane Harbor Will Stay in the Ownership of the State\", Baltic News Service, 17 June 2002 (**C-075**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 480 (emphasis original), *referring to* Letter of the President of Estonia, Lennart Meri, to the Minster of Environment, Heiki Kranich, 27 June 2000 (**C-208**). *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 76:15 \u2013 77:10.\n\n829.\n\nAs examples of the arbitrary and discriminatory actions the Respondent took towards the Claimant, the Claimant cites to:\n\n(a) the Respondent's decision to move the icebreaker *Great T\u00f5ll* to the entranceway of the Seaplane Harbor, cutting off large ship traffic and forcing the Claimant's subsidiaries to reduce their activities to small ship repairs.1299 This measure, the Claimant contends, was not based on reason because (i) the Maritime Administration had recognized that the berth was unsafe and prone to accidents;1300 and (ii) at the time, the decision of the Tallinn City Court, finding that Estonia was the rightful owner of the Seaplane Harbor buildings, had been quashed by the Circuit Court, so Estonia had no right \"founded on law\" to place the icebreaker there;1301 and\n\n(b) the Respondent's failure to grant BPV a Port Passport and customs control zone with respect to the Seaplane Harbor. According to the Claimant, Verest held \"an unlimited duration operating customs operation permit\"\u2014a Port Passport, in 1993, which allowed \"Estonian customs operations to take place at the [Seaplane Harbor].\"1302 After BPV acquired Verest and sought to have the customs permits transferred to its name, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent \"made this impossible\" by arbitrarily (i) refusing to recognize the validity of Verest's Port Passport from 1 January 1999 onwards, thereby forcing BPV to apply for a new Port Passport and authorization for a customs control zone;1303 (ii) refusing to coordinate the port basin assignment, which was necessary for BPV to qualify for a Port Passport, on the ground that the ownership of the port territory was disputed;1304 and (iii) refusing to grant BPV a customs control zone.1305 The Claimant alleges that the Respondent arbitrarily and \"falsely relied on the legal fiction that Verest had no lawful possession at the Lennusadam Port\" to reject its applications,1306 while at the same time granting other post assignments and permits to other Estonian ports in similar1307 situations.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 481; Reply, \u00b6 248.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 483, *referring to* Letter from the Claimant to the Ministry of Environment, 5 December 2003 (**C-126**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 482, *referring to* May 2002 Appeal Judgment (**C-191**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 528, 530, 574, 827; Claimant's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6 3*.

The Claimant, relying on Mr. Kere's analysis, argues that the Respondent \"could have approved the port basin since [ELA]'s subsidiaries' possession was presumably lawful, in good faith and legal pursuant to the Law of Property Act. *See* 1 October 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34, *citing* Fourth Keres Report, \u00b6 57 (**CER-8**). Moreover, contrary to what the Respondent alleges, the Claimant contends that there is nothing in the Haltransa decision to support that legality of the port possession was a factor in determining port basin coordinates. *See* Fourth Keres Report, \u00b6 54, *referring to* Tallinn City Council Decision No. 209, 15 June 2006 (**R-235**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 544-565; Claimants' Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6 26. The Claimant submits that BPV was entitled to establish a customs control zone because (i) Verest operated a *de facto* customs zone in light of the Maritime Administration's recognition of Verest's Port Passport; (ii) the JVA gave BPV the possessory rights at the Lennusadam Port, *i.e.*, BPV and Verest had presumptively valid title at the Lennusadam Port under Estonian law; and (iii) only BPV's consent was necessary for a customs zone to be awarded. Therefore, the Claimant argues that BPV, as the presumptive legal owner of the Lennusadam Port, was entitled to apply for and receive authorization to operate a customs zone. *See* Claimant's Answers to Tribunal Questions, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5-8, 31-36, 38-39. *See also* Third Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 360-362 (**CER-4**); Fourth Keres Report, \u00b6 55 (**CER-8**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 600, 610, 1179.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 603-604, 829, 1237.\n\n**b) The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n830.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the prerequisites of a breach of Article II(3)(b) of the Treaty \"are a showing of arbitrary or discriminatory measures which impair in some way the management of the investments and which are attributable to the state.\"1308 The Respondent avers that whilst \"a measure is arbitrary if it is made without reason, in willful disregard of the due process of law,\" a host State acts in a discriminatory manner \"if like situations are not treated similarly without a rational justification.\"1309\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 559.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 560, *referring to Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S.

Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2013-15, Award, 22 November 2018, \u00b6 711 (**RLA-138**).\n\n834.\n\nThirdly, the Respondent asserts that none of the measures the Claimant takes issue with were arbitrary.1313 In particular, the Respondent argues that:\n\n(a) The articles published in the media and the general sentiment of the local population, on which the Claimant relies to support its claim, \"are not conduct attributable to the state\";1314\n\n(b) The icebreaker *Suur T\u00f5ll* was relocated to berth No. 36A for budgetary reasons, specifically so that the State would not have to pay substantial berthing fees at a different location.1315 Moreover, the Respondent emphasizes that since berth No. 36A is owned by Estonia, and there has been no dispute over its title or possession of this berth, the Respondent could make use of it \"for any purpose it saw fit.\"1316 Moreover, the Respondent points out that, as an aerial image of the area clearly demonstrates, the icebreaker was not \"blocking the entrance to the port nor limiting the use of the port in any other unreasonable manner\";1317\n\n(c) Contrary to the Claimant's contention, none of the Claimant's Estonian subsidiaries held \"pre-existing permits that needed to be or could be prolonged, re-issued or transferred.\" Rather, the Claimant's subsidiary, BPV, sought a port passport and the coordination of the port basin for the first time in 2002 and sought customs authorization for the first time in 2001, and these applications were all denied for good reason;1318\n\n(d) Concerning the port passport, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant's application was denied because of its unsuccessful efforts to obtain coordination of the port basin, which was a necessary prerequisite.1319 In any event, the Respondent maintains that \"[t]here is nothing on the record that would suggest that the absence of a port passport either before 1 January 2001 or after that date, prevented the Claimant from operating the port\";1320 and\n\n(e) Concerning the coordination of the port basin, the Respondent's refusal to do so is justified because (i) there was no *prima facie* basis to treat the Claimant temporarily as a lawful possessor of the Seaplane Harbor and waive the requirement for the port possessor to produce proof of ownership or lawful possession \u2013 a requirement that had been uniformly applied to all ports in Estonia;1321 (ii) the Claimant failed to obtain coordination from its neighbors, as affirmed in the Haltransa case;1322 and (iii) the Respondent was under no public law obligation, as the owner of the neighboring mole and berths, to allow the use of the port basin by a third party.1323\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 564-570.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 564.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 567;

Arbitrary Measures*\n-----------------------\n\n*(I.) Legal Standard*\n---------------------\n\n839.\n\nThe Treaty does not define the concept of arbitrariness or what arbitrary measures are, but the Parties substantially agree that a measure is arbitrary when it is not founded on reason.1327\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 494, *referring to Lauder v. Czech Republic*, 2001 WL 347860000, Final Award, 3 September 2001, \u00b6\u00b6 221, 232 (**CLA-085**); Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 560, *referring to Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S.

The Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award, 25 June 2001, \u00b6 371 (**RLA-126**).\n\n840.\n\nConsistently with investment case law, to qualify as arbitrary, a measure must depart from either reason, law or fact, as articulated by the tribunals in *Genin v. Estonia1328* and *Lauder v. Czech Republic*.1329\n\n*Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v.

Czech Republic*, 2001 WL 347860000, Final Award, 3 September 2001, \u00b6 232 (**CLA-085**)\n\n842.\n\nTherefore, to be successful with its claim of arbitrary behavior, an investor would need to prove that the State's challenged actions were based on an improper motivation (such as fear reflecting national preference or hostility towards a group of people) rather than on a reasonable rationale.\n\n*(II.) Application to the Facts*\n--------------------------------\n\n843.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider whether the contested measures were based on an improper motivation, as alleged by the Claimant. Then, it will examine if any reasonable rationale could instead be the ground for the allegedly arbitrary measures.\n\n*(A.) Improper Motivation*\n--------------------------\n\n844.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's measures \"were arbitrary [\u2026] because they were not based on reason, but on prejudice toward ELA because its owner and employees were of Russian heritage and spoke Russian.\"1332 To support its statements, the Claimant adduces as evidence first the Estonian newspapers' emphasis on the Russian identity of the Lennusadam Port's possessors, second a letter by the Estonian President Meri addressing the dispute and again the Russian identity of the Claimant, and third the move of the *Suur T\u00f5ll* to berth 36A in proximity of the Claimant's possessions.1333\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 476.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 477-486.\n\n845.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that the articles and books referenced by the Claimant indicate the existence of an \"anti-Russian\" sentiment in the Estonian people in the aftermath of the Soviet occupation.1334 Nonetheless, they constitute general information that is unrelated to the conduct of the State. Independent reporting sources such as the Baltic News Service and the Journal of Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe can hardly serve to establish a prejudicial attitude of the Respondent towards the Claimant. The Tribunal must therefore disregard them in its analysis.\n\nRask Started Disciplinary Proceedings Against Judge, Baltic News Service, 20 November 2000 (**C-072**); \"Laar Confirms that the Conflicting Seaplane Harbor Will Stay in the Ownership of the State\", Baltic News Service, 17 June 2002 (**C-075**); Ryo Nakai, \"The Influence of Party Competition on Minority Politics: A Comparison of Latvia and Estonia\", Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe, 13(1), 2004, p. 62 (**C-272**).\n\n846.\n\nThe statements made by President Lennart Meri to the Minister of the Environment Heiki Kranich on \"a large scaled state theft in the area of the seaplane hangar [\u2026] by self-appointed Russians thieves\"1335 are instead the expression of a State organ. Even though there is no evidence that the President was involved in the decisions leading to the contested measures, his statements are improper and indicate malicious motives rather than a well-reasoned decision. However, the Tribunal finds that these motives alone could not substantiate a claim of arbitrary behavior. Only together with the absence of a reasonable rationale could they support a finding of arbitrary measures. Also, given the ongoing dispute over the ownership of the harbor, more emotional statements could hardly give rise to a breach of the FET standard if the relevant measures were also supported by reason, law or fact, to which the Tribunal will turn later in its analysis.\n\nLetter of the President of Estonia, Lennart Meri, to the Minster of Environment, Heiki Kranich, 27 June 2000 (**C-208**). *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 1, pp. 76-77:24-14.\n\n847.\n\nThe relocation of the *Suur T\u00f5ll* to berth 36A of the Port on 26 January 20041336 was, according to the Claimant, \"clearly arbitrary and solely intended to harass the ELA Estonian Subsidiaries.\"1337\n\nERR, \"The *Suur T\u00f5ll* Is Transported to the Seaplane Harbor\", 25 January 2004 (**R-161**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 484.\n\n848.\n\nThe Claimant objected to the planned move on 5 December 2003. The Claimant asserts that given that berth 36A was recognized by the Maritime Administration \"as unsafe and prone to accidents [\u2026] placing *Great T\u00f5ll* [was] categorically prohibited before the prior removal of any unsafe conditions.\"1338 The Claimant further noted that \"the falling of the berth because of the pressure from the icebreaker, would violate the rights of the owners of other berths to use, possess and dispose of their berths as it would close the canal of the port and the vessels would not access in or out of the port.\"1339\n\nLetter from the Claimant to the Ministry of Environment, 5 December 2003 (**C-126**).\n\nLetter from the Claimant to the Ministry of Environment, 5 December 2003 (**C-126**).\n\n849.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Icebreaker partially blocked off the entranceway of the Lennusadam Port, cutting off large ship traffic, and that, as a result, afterward BPV could only use the Port for small ship repairs.1340 Eventually, the icebreaker was moved slightly to permit some limited small ship access to the Port.1341\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 165, *citing* Second Rotko Statement, \u00b6 80 (**CWS-2**). *See also* Witness Statement of Ms. Olga Kotova dated 29 August 2019, \u00b6 21 (**CWS-3**): \"Over time, this caused great economic harm to ELA as we could not have any large ships come to the Port.\"\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6 81 (**CWS-2**).\n\n850.\n\nTo support its assertion that the relocation was arbitrary, the Claimant submitted a newspaper article that emphasized the hostile Russian speakers present at the relocation and their complaints in Russian as reminiscing of the Soviet occupation to the other attendees.1342 The Tribunal must disregard it for the same reasons as above, that is, because the Postimees newspaper is not an expression of the State.\n\n\"*Great T\u00f5ll* found a new home base in the hostile Seaplane Harbor\", Postimees, 27 January 2004 (**C-125**): \"'Do not be shy! Nelsja shvartovatsya! (Exit from here! You cannot dock here! - ed.)' The Russian-language order was heard from the radio [\u2026] The people of the sea museum and journalists waiting for the icebreaker felt like the time maschine had been turnt back 10 years and the Russian army had still not left Estonia [sic].\" *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 3, pp. 34-35:16-22.\n\n851.\n\nWhether the relocation was malicious in itself depends on the presence of an improper motivation. On this point, the Respondent denies not only any malicious intent, but also the danger and encumbrance of the *Suur T\u00f5ll* at its new location. Strong support for the Respondent's position is offered, in the view of the Tribunal, by the following aerial photographs showing the location of the icebreaker at berth 36A of the Lennusadam Port.1343\n\nAerial Photo of the Position of the Icebreaker *Suur T\u00f5ll* at the Seaplane Harbor, 3 June 2004 (**R-158**); M.

The Seaplane Harbor from 1990 to 2010\" in *Tallinn's Seaplane Hangar: From Plane Shed to Museum*, 2015, p. 8 (**R-133**).\n\n852.\n\nIf moving the *Suur T\u00f5ll* was indeed an encumbrance and unsafe, this might indicate that there was some improper motivation behind the move. From the evidence presented, the *Suur T\u00f5ll* did not pose an obstacle to the Claimant's port operations, and, as stated by Mr. Rotko, it was even slightly moved to accommodate more ship traffic into the Lennusadam Port. Further, the only evidence presented as to the safety hazard posed by the ship at berth 36A is a letter from BPV to the Ministry of Environment.1344 No neutral source suggests that the new position of the *Suur T\u00f5ll* was dangerous in any way. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant failed to demonstrate that harassment and anti-Russian sentiments were the real basis of the Respondent's actions.\n\nLetter from the Claimant to the Ministry of Environment, 5 December 2003 (**C-126**).\n\n*(B.) Reasonable Rationale*\n---------------------------\n\n853.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider whether a reasonable rationale motivated instead the allegedly arbitrary actions of the Respondent, namely the relocation of the *Suur T\u00f5ll* and the denial of permits related to the port.\n\n*(1.) The Suur T\u00f5ll \"Blockade\"*\n-------------------------------\n\n854.\n\nThe Icebreaker *Suur T\u00f5ll*, built in 1914, is a museum exhibit of the Maritime Museum of Estonia. Prior to January 2004, the *Suur T\u00f5ll* was located in the Admiral Pool at the Port of Tallinn.1345 In October 2003, the Baltic News Service announced that the Estonian government was going to move the *Suur T\u00f5ll* into berth 36A at the Lennusadam Port.1346 It is uncontested that berth 36A is owned by the Respondent and not subject to dispute.1347 As such, it is doubtful whether the Respondent's use of its own property could constitute an arbitrary measure or, for that matter, require a particular reason.\n\nDELFI, \"The *Suur T\u00f5ll* Will Be Moved To a More Favorable Area\", 6 January 2004 (**R-160**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 161-162; \"*Great T\u00f5ll* will permanently leave the Admiral Pool\", Postimees, 28 October 2003 (**C-124**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 5(i); Reply, \u00b6 64.\n\n855.\n\nRegardless, at the time news reports recorded that, after the conclusion of a three-year lease contract in its former city center location, the Maritime Museum needed to place the icebreaker in a new site for budgetary reasons.1348 The Respondent further explained that the previous berthing fees were too costly and that the relocation to the Lennusadam Port \"was in line with the Maritime Museum's plan to move all its ship exhibits in the future to its berths at the Seaplane Harbor.\"1349\n\nDELFI, \"The *Suur T\u00f5ll* Will Be Moved To a More Favorable Area\", 6 January 2004 (**R-160**).\n\nCounter-memorial, \u00b6 567 *referring to* DELFI, \"The *Suur T\u00f5ll* Will Be Moved To a More Favorable Area\", 6 January 2004 (**R-160**); \"*Suur T\u00f5ll* leaves Admiraliteedi Pool permanently\", Postimees, 28 October 2003 (**C-124**).\n\n856.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied with the Respondent's reasons, which are credible and sufficiently substantiated by reports of the time.\n\n*(2.) The Administrative \"Blockade\"*\n------------------------------------\n\n857.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it was treated unfavorably by way of an \"administrative blockade\" in the treatment of its applications for a Port Passport, for coordination of the Port Basin, and for a Customs Zone, which the Claimant ultimately failed to obtain because of the ownership dispute.\n\n858.\n\nWhile the Respondent has pointed to certain shortfalls in the Claimant's compliance with the relevant application processes, the record shows that the Claimant's inability to obtain the necessary port basin approvals, port passport, customs authorization, or building permits was ultimately due to the ownership dispute.\n\n859.\n\nThe approvals of the Government of Estonia were required in two capacities: first, approval of the port basin in the capacity of the owner; and second, approval of the port basin boundary coordinates as the owner of the immediately adjacent port basin on the eastern side. Pursuant to section 4(2) of the 1997 Ports Act, the limits of a seaport basin were to be established by the Government of the Republic on the basis of a proposal by the Minister for Roads and Communications and with the approval of the council (the legislative body) of the relevant local municipality.1350 To obtain the approval of the port basin from the local municipality, the Claimant had to obtain coordination of the boundary of the sea basin by agreement with the possessors of the neighboring areas and hold ownership or lawful possession of the port, or authorization from the lawful possessor.1351\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 383.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 391, 394.\n\n860.\n\nThe basin of the Seaplane Harbor is delimited on the western side by the sea basin of the Noblessner/Peetri Port. The Seaplane Harbor basin is delimited on the eastern side by the L-shaped eastern mole and its berths (K\u00fcti 15A). A chart showing the port basin of the Seaplane Harbor as of 25 February 2020 is shown here:1352\n\nMap of the port basin of the Seaplane Harbor from the Port Registry, accessed on 25 February 2020 (**R-104**).\n\n861.\n\nThe Claimant obtained coordination with AS S Tallinna Meretehas (Noblessner/Peetri Port) with the Noblessner/Peetri side as of 23 August 2002.1353 The owner of K\u00fcti 15A, including the mole and berths, is the State of Estonia. Until 2003, K\u00fcti 15A was administered by the Ministry of the Environment, at which point it was transferred to Riigi Kinnisvara AS (\"**Riigi Kinnisvara**\"), the state-owned real estate company.1354\n\nLetter from BPV to State Real Estate, 30 September 2003 (**C-274**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 390.\n\n862.\n\nFrom June 1999 onwards, the Claimant's subsidiaries sought assistance in the coordination of the port basin. The Ministry of Transport declined to coordinate the port basin on the grounds of the lack of owner's consent, as confirmed by a letter dated 28 January 2003:\n\nthe possessor of berths on Seaplane Harbor \"L\" shaped pier and the 28-hectare property located on port territory is the state, and the possessor is Ministry of the Environment. AS BPV is not the possessor of the port, therefore you do not have the authority to apply for Seaplane Harbor port basin. You would have the authority as the port possessor or as a person/enterprise authorized by the possessor. We return your submitted documents and recommend reaching an agreement with the port possessor. After receiving corresponding documents, we are willing to submit them ourselves to Tallinn City Council coordination for an accelerated processing and thereafter to Government of the Republic approval.1355\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications to BPV, 28 January 2003 (**C-466**).\n\n863.\n\nBPV requested coordination of the port basin boundary coordinates with Riigi Kinnisvara on five occasions between 2003 and 2005 without success.1356 BPV could not complete this process unless and until Riigi supplied coordinating information to the Maritime Administration. In a letter of 15 July 2004,1357 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (the successor to the Ministry for Roads and Communications) informed the Claimant that the State would not coordinate the basin until the ownership dispute over the Seaplane Harbor was resolved.\n\nLetter from BPV to State Real Estate, 30 May 2003 (**C-273**); Letter from BPV to State Real Estate, 30 September 2003 (**C-274**); Letter from BPV to State Real Estate (with attachment), 1 March 2004 (**C-275**); BPV application for coordination of port basin borders, 27 January 2004 (**C-276**); Verest letter to State Real Estate re. Port Basin, 7 January 2005 (**C-277**).\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications to BPV, 15 July 2004 (**C-477**).\n\n864.\n\nThe Respondent admits that it might have been obliged to initiate coordination of the port basin with the Claimant if it was the *prima facie* owner of the port, but this was not the case. The Respondent further argues that there was never any customs-related activity in the port,1358 so there was no permit that should merely be transferred from Verest to BPV.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 403-404.\n\n865.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant's arguments are premised on the conviction that it was the owner or at least rightful possessor of the Lennusadam Port but, as previously established, this was not the case. Given the Tribunal's findings as to the Claimant's lack of ownership, its claims cannot rest on the presumption that it was a *prima facie* owner. Even if the legal situation regarding the ownership of the Port was unclear at the time, it was not irrational for the State to deny permits to entities that it reasonably held to be unlawful possessors of State property.\n\n866.\n\nThe Port Act made port passports mandatory, and the explanatory memorandum explained the prerequisites for their issuance: the applicant must prove ownership or right of use of port land (i.e., a right to possession) to acquire the port passport.1359 The procedure for obtaining a port passport was specified in a governmental decree No. 63 of 17 March 1998 and required a prior inspection by a governmental commission on the application of the port's possessor.1360 The inspection could not be passed unless the port's possessor was able to produce documents proving the allocation of the port territory (land territory and sea basin). For land territory, this meant documents proving either ownership or lawful possession; for the sea basin, which could not be privately owned, this required coordination from the government.1361 The Claimant failed to obtain these prerequisites, as made clear in the correspondence exchanged between 2002 and 2004 in relation to the port basin.\n\nThe Port Act \u00a7 20 Amendment Act, Explanatory Memorandum, 1977 (**C-525**); *cf. also* Third Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 276 et seq. (**CER-4**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 379; Government Regulation on the Approval of the Procedure for Opening the Port to Shipping, 31 December 2004 (**C-536**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 380.\n\n867.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, since Verest held a port passport, it should have been transferred to BPV upon acquiring Verest. When Estonia denied the transfer and stated that BPV would have to apply for a new license due to the change in ownership, BPV was prevented from clearing commercial shipments and operating the customs zone.\n\n868.\n\nFurther, the Parties disagree on the notion of port passports and custom authorizations. According to the Respondent, the Claimant confuses the port passport with the customs authorization.1362 While the Claimant states that \"an unlimited duration operating customs operation permit is 'known as a Port Passport'\",1363 the Respondent asserts that a port passport has nothing to do with customs.1364 In the Tribunal's view, this misunderstanding gives rise to further doubts as to the Claimant's argument on the port passport and its allegedly arbitrary denial.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 397.\n\nReply, \u00b6 528.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 397.\n\n869.\n\nIn any event, the denial of the port passport could arguably only constitute arbitrary behavior if the Claimant was entitled to receive a port passport or to have Verest's port passport transferred to BPV, and if there was no reasonable rationale behind its denial.\n\n870.\n\nIn its submissions, the Claimant relies on the Certificate about the scope of the building right and use issued by the Tallinn City Planning Office1365 to state that the \"Maritime Administration re-registered the Verest port passport,\"1366 but the document mentions neither Verest nor the term \"Port passport\". Only the Port Passport issued to Verest and dated 7 October 19931367 states that it was first registered in 1993 and then re-registered in 1994. Further, the Claimant asserts that the port passport was denied because Verest needed to apply for a new passport due to the change in control of Verest after the acquisition by BPV, but that this explanation finds no basis in law.1368\n\nTallinn City Planning Office Certificate about the scope of building right and use, 21 August 1997 (**C-041**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 529.\n\nLennusadam Port Passport, 7 October 1993 (**C-201**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 534(1).\n\n871.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant failed to substantiate that it was legally entitled to receive or transfer a port passport. There is indeed no provision submitted by the Claimant that would give rise to a legal entitlement to transfer a port passport. Rather, the legal framework on port operations suggests that no such legal entitlement existed. Support for this view is offered by Mr. Keres' statement that \"there was no reason the port passport could not have been transferred as there were no relevant rules in place.\"1369\n\nThird Keres Report, \u00b6 262.\n\n872.\n\nIn 1993, there was no requirement of law to have a port passport.1370 Instead, port operations were regulated by the Merchant Shipping Code,1371 which does not elaborate on the prerequisites of receiving a port passport.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 341.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 180; Third Keres Report, \u00b6 256 (**CER-4**); Merchant Shipping Code, 9 December 1991 (**C-540**).\n\n873.\n\nThe Port Act made port passports mandatory, and its explanatory memorandum set out the prerequisites for their issue: the applicant must prove ownership or right of use of port land (i.e., a right to possession) to acquire the port passport.1372 There is no reason to believe that the Maritime Administration had already assessed Verest's ownership of lawful possession of the port in 1993. Hence, with new legal rules in place, it seems reasonable for the Respondent to demand a new application for a port passport from BPV.\n\nThe Port Act \u00a7 20 Amendment Act, Explanatory Memorandum, 1977 (**C-525**); *cf. also* Third Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 276 et seq. (**CER-4**).\n\n874.\n\nRespondent's denial of transferring the port passport to BPV, or granting BPV a new port passport, was therefore not arbitrary as it was based on a reasonable rationale.\n\n875.\n\nThe approval of the State of Estonia was required in the capacity of the owner of the land. The Ministry of Justice explained that it was not possible to issue consent while the ownership dispute was pending.\n\n876.\n\nContrary to the Claimant's assertion, the fact that Verest applied for a customs permit in 1994 does not prove that it was ever issued.1373 The Respondent submits that Verest never had any kind of customs permit.1374\n\nVerest application for permit of import-export cargo through port Lennusadam, 26 July 1994 (**C-040**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 406.\n\n877.\n\nBeginning in April 2001, BPV made a number of applications and requests for a customs control zone at the Seaplane Harbor.1375 These requests were unsuccessful, *inter alia*, because they did not specify or submit documentation of the water area for the zone and generally due to shortcomings of the port layout, which made it unsuitable for a customs control zone.1376 By letter dated 12 August 2002, the Customs Board stated that BPV needed the approval of the Ministry of Justice, which was the owner, before the Port could be designated a customs control zone.1377\n\nBPV Application for the Customs Control Zone Coordination, 4 April 2001 (**C-265**); BPV Application for the Customs Control Zone of Seaplane Harbor, 27 April 2001 (**C-266**).\n\nEstonian Customs Board letter no. 4.1./1803 to BPV, 29 May 2001 (**C-431**); Legal Instrument No. 20, 21 May 2001 (**C-429**); Estonian Customs Board letter no. 3.1.-20/2031 to BPV, 22 October 2011 (**C-430**).\n\nLetter from Estonian Customs Board to Verest and BPV, 12 August 2002 (**C-269**). The Customs Board noted: \"As the Seaplane Harbor territory is currently in state's ownership, it is necessary to receive the approval from the representative of the state \u2013Ministry of Justice in order to designate customs control zone. The territory in your use and the proposed customs control zone area is on the Ministry of Justice balance.\"\n\n878.\n\nIn 2002,1378 BPV sought to obtain that approval from the Ministry of Justice, which Minister M\u00e4rt Rask refused on 23 September 2002.1379 As the basis for this refusal, Minister Rask stated the \"ongoing court action in regards to K\u00fcti 17 where the Republic of Estonia is claiming the ownership.\"1380\n\nLetter from BPV to Ministry of Justice, 14 August 2002 (**C-407**).\n\nLetter from Ministry of Justice to BPV, 23 September 2002 (**C-270**).\n\nLetter from Ministry of Justice to BPV, 23 September 2002 (**C-270**).\n\n879.\n\nIn 2003, BPV again sought the approval of the Ministry of Justice. On 21 January 2004, the Ministry of Justice, Minister Ken-Marti Vaher, responded to BPV,1381 explaining that it was not possible to issue consent due to the pending ownership dispute. It also explained that regardless of the existence of the customs control zone, it would be impossible to operate the Seaplane Harbor as long as it lacked a port passport. Minister Vaher also noted that the Ministry's approval would not matter, as BPV had not yet obtained a port passport and thus could not use the Port even with customs authorization.1382\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Justice to BPV, 21 January 2004 (**C-271**).\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Justice to BPV, 21 January 2004 (**C-271**).\n\n880.\n\nOverall, the Tribunal is satisfied that the permit was denied on the basis of the reasonable rationale that there was no approval by the owner of the port, namely the State. The contested measure was, therefore, not arbitrary.\n\n881.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the Claimant did not obtain building permits because it did not apply for any. However, the Respondent recognizes that after the court prohibited all construction works at the Seaplane Harbor on 21 July 2000, for the duration of the dispute regarding the ownership of the buildings, such applications would not be successful.1383\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 279.\n\n882.\n\nIn the ownership lawsuit, Estonia petitioned the Tallinn City Court to enjoin all construction works at the Seaplane Harbor. In its order of 21 July 2000, the Tallinn City Court explicitly prohibited further changes to the composition of the buildings and structures on the site or the erection of new buildings and structures.1384 On 21 August 2000, the Tallinn Urban Planning Department ordered the immediate termination of the construction works,1385 but the works continued.1386 On 4 September 2000, the Tallinn City Planning Office issued a further prescription to suspend the unauthorized construction, followed by proceedings for an administrative offence.1387\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 358-359, Letter from Verest to the Ministry of Justice regarding settlement offer, 15 December 1999 (**C-058**); Letter from Ministry of Justice to Verest, 12 January 2000 (**C-059**); Toomas K\u00fcmmel, \"M\u00f5is played the area of the Seaplane Harbor with the help of Lao to the violator of law,\" Eesti P\u00e4evaleht, 25 April 2001 (**C-069**); August 2000 Judgment, Decision, 21 July 2000, \u00b6 419 (**C-064**); August 2000 Judgment (**C-068**). *See* May 2002 Appeal Judgment (**C-191**); July 2005 Judgment (**C-078**); Republic of Estonia's appeal to the Tallinn City Court Judgment of 4 July 2005, 25 July 2005 (**R-102**); March 2006 Appeal Judgment (**C-081**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 422, *referring to* Prescription of Tallinn City Planning Office no. 976, 21 August 2000 (**R-142**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 422, *referring to* Prescription of the Tallinn City Planning Office, 4 September 2000 (**R-143**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 422, *referring to* Administrative offence report no. 980A, 4 September 2000 (**R-144**); Reply, \u00b6 520, *referring to* Report of administrative offense to P.Toom, 3 August 2000 (**C-469**).\n\n883.\n\nUltimately, the Tribunal is satisfied that the contested measures were based on reasonable grounds. While the icebreaker *Suur T\u00f5ll* was moved due to higher berthing fees at the original location, the permits were denied because the Claimant had no ownership or right to possession of the port.\n\n*ii. Discriminatory Measures*\n-----------------------------\n\n*(I.) Legal Standard*\n---------------------\n\n884.\n\nThe Treaty does not define what discriminatory measures are. Case law considers discriminatory \"a differential treatment of people or companies in like circumstances, without a rational justification for that differential treatment.\"1388\n\n*South American Silver Limited v. Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2013-15, Award, 22 November 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 710-711 (**RLA-138**). *See* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 560. *See also CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB701/08, Award, 25 April 2005, \u00b6 289 (**CLA-090**); *Saluka Investments BC (the Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic*, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, \u00b6 309 (**CLA-069**).\n\n885.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal is persuaded that, to be successful with its claim of discriminatory behavior, an investor must prove that other investors in like circumstances were treated differently and that there was no justification for this difference of treatment.\n\n*(II.) Application to the Facts*\n--------------------------------\n\n886.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that it was in \"like circumstances\" with the Noblessner/Peetri, Bekker, Muuga, Miiduranna, Kunda, Loksa, and Paldiski North Ports, on the basis that likeness is to be applied in the case of regulatory measures of general applicability.1389 It also submits that, like the Lennusadam Port, these comparable ports used to be government property and partially even used by the Soviet military.1390 Similarly, they \"were privatized around the same period of time.\"1391\n\nReply, \u00b6 1311.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 515.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 513.\n\n887.\n\nIt is undisputed that the investors to which the Claimant points for comparison, namely, investors in the Noblessner/Peetri, Bekker, Miiduranna, Muuga, Loksa, Kunda, and Paldiski North Ports, were able to conduct operations with the necessary permits. The Respondent asserts that those other ports were not in \"like circumstances\" because not one of them was subject to a legal dispute over possession. In respect of each of the allegedly \"like\" circumstances, the Respondent has provided evidence of the circumstances in which the relevant interests were transferred to private ownership.\n\n888.\n\nThe Government of Estonia effected the transfer to private ownership of the Miiduranna Port1392 and the Kunda Port in 1991.1393 The Government of Estonia, via the Estonian Privatization Agency, effected the transfers to private ownership of the Peetri/Noblessner Port in 1995,1394 and the Bekkeri Port1395 and Loksa Port1396 in 1994. The transfer to private ownership of the Paldiski North Port was first effected by the City of Paldiski.1397 The Muuga Port is not in private ownership.

The Respondent has drawn attention to the fact that it did assert its ownership rights against O\u00dc B&E in the same 1997 lawsuit.1400\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6 49.\n\n891.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the fact that the other Estonian Ports were subject to the same general regulatory scheme is a sufficient factor to establish that they were in \"like\" circumstances.1401 The Claimant argues that the relevance of the ownership dispute is inappropriately specific, as it amounts to a requirement of identical situations.1402\n\nSee *Bilcon, Clayton et al v. Canada*, PCA Case No. 2009-04, Jurisdiction and Merits Award, 17 March 2005, \u00b6 693 (**CLA-082**); *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v.

As a matter of logic, a treatment of permits that were \"not conditioned\" on \"conclusive determination\" of title could only be established in situations where there was some uncertainty as to title that went unresolved. The Claimant does not assert that there was any other Estonian port that had been transferred to private ownership by an entity that could not validly do so, as had the Soviet military purported to do in the case of the Seaplane Harbor, or that there was any other reason to doubt the validity of the title of the other port operators.1403\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1365-1367.\n\n893.\n\nThere is no precedent of a port basin having been approved for a port with a disputed ownership status. On the contrary, the Respondent has presented an instance where a company requesting the coordination of port basin borders was unsuccessful because it lacked the necessary authorizations from its neighbors.1404 The Tallinn City Council did not approve AS Haltransa's request for coordination of the port basin borders at Haltransa port because it lacked coordination from the neighboring Paljassaare harbor. The Respondent has also cited the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of AS Maseka, in respect of a port in P\u00e4rnu City, which confirms that the courts at the time treated the ownership or lawful possession of the port territory as a necessary condition for the approval of a port basin.1405\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 395. Response To Claimant's 1 October 2021 Submission**,** 3 November 2021, \u00b6 19, *citing* (**RLA-229**). Tallinn City Council Decision No. 209, 15 June 2006 (**R-235**). The circumstances of the Haltransa case are explained in the Tallinn Circuit Court judgment of 16 July 2007, case no. 3-06-95 (**RLA-229**).\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Estonia, case 3-3-1-72-05, 12 January 2006 (**RLA-201**).\n\n894.\n\nThe Claimant argues that since the question of ownership is the subject of the Parties' dispute, this difference is \"self-judging\". The Claimant alleges that the Respondent cannot treat it disparately, \"creating disparate circumstances\" and then rely on such disparate circumstances to justify the original disparate treatment.1406 The Respondent contends that its decision to contest the lawfulness of the possession of the Claimant's subsidiaries and reclaim the possession was not arbitrary nor discriminatory but based on a valid assessment of the factual situation.1407\n\nReply, \u00b6 1287.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 475 (**RLA-201**).\n\n895.\n\nThe decision to contest the lawfulness of the possession of the Lennusadam Port was taken on the basis of the circumstances in which, according to the Claimant, title had been passed from State to private ownership prior to the Claimant's involvement. Those factual circumstances pre-dated the Claimant's involvement and the Respondent's decision to claim possession of the Lennusadam Port. The decision to initiate litigation did not create the facts on which it was based. Those facts were unique to the Seaplane Harbor. Not one of the other port investors derives its possession and use from transactions with the Soviet army during the occupation. The Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent created disparate circumstances by treating the Claimant disparately.\n\n896.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimant submits that the litigation was a discriminatory measure in itself, as \"[n]one of the other private Port owners had litigation brought against them, none of the other private Port owners were denied a port passport, and none of the other Port owners had their investments taken from them.\"1408\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 367.\n\n897.\n\nOn this point, the Tribunal is persuaded that to establish \"like circumstances\", the Claimant would have to demonstrate that there was another port whose ownership was equally contested as the Lennusadam's. The ownership dispute is indeed a differentiating factor between the disputed port and the others brought as a comparison by the Claimant. The denial of the port passport and the alleged \"taking\" of the investment were also based on the ownership dispute.\n\n898.\n\nThe Claimant therefore failed to demonstrate that the other investors, who were allegedly treated better, were in like circumstances, as they did not derive their possession and use of the port from transactions with the Soviet army during the occupation. The perceived differential treatment was instead grounded on the different circumstances surrounding ownership.\n\n*iii. Impairment of the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of the investment*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n899.\n\nAs to impairment, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent's statement that an arbitrary or discriminatory measure must have an impact on the investment in order to constitute a violation of the Treaty.1409\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 560.\n\n900.\n\nThe Claimant has brought limited evidence to support the claims that its investments were impaired. While the Claimant states that \"ELA U.S.A. lost a great deal of business because customers realized that this delay in getting the customs issue resolved could be indefinite,\"1410 there seems to be little, if any, evidence in this regard. The Claimant's impairment argument that its subsidiaries should have received a license under Estonian law is still premised on the fact that they were the owners or lawful possessors of the Port, which they were not.1411 It also remains unsubstantiated what kind of ship traffic could be impaired by the *Suur T\u00f5ll* when positioned at berth 36A.\n\nReply, \u00b6 541.\n\nReply, \u00b6 565.\n\n901.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, finds that the Claimant failed to prove that its investments suffered impairment. In any case, also based on its previous findings, no arbitrary or discriminatory measures were taken against the Claimant in the first place. The Tribunal finds that no violation of Article II(3)(b) has occurred.\n\n**3. Art.

The Tribunal's Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n*(I.) Legal Standard*\n---------------------\n\n917.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that solicitation for corrupt payment attributable to a State is a violation of the FET standard.1453 The two forms of corruption that are potentially relevant here are bribery and extortion. When a public official solicits payment in return for \"better than fair\" treatment, then this usually constitutes bribery. Extortion includes situations in which a public official solicits payment under threat of withholding a service or benefit otherwise required by law.1454\n\n*See, e.g.*, *EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, \u00b6 221 (**RLA-133**).\n\nA Llamzon, *Corruption in International Investment Arbitration,* (Oxford University Press, 2014), \u00b6\u00b6 2.05. 2.08 (**CLA-157**).\n\n918.\n\nAs the party alleging acts of corruption in violation of the FET standard, the Claimant bears the burden of proof that these acts have occurred. There is no universally accepted formulation regarding the standard of proof that a foreign investor must meet to successfully raise a treaty claim based on corruption. The Tribunal notes that in civil law cases domestic courts typically decide factual issues on the balance of probabilities. Since acts of corruption are *de facto* of a criminal law nature and entail, if attributable, the international responsibility of the State party, the Tribunal considers a higher standard of proof appropriate. The arbitral jurisprudence submitted by the Parties supports this view. In *Bayindir. v. Pakistan*, for example, the tribunal assessed whether the evidence submitted in support of the allegation of corruption is sufficient to exclude any reasonable doubt.1455 Domestic courts typically apply this standard as the relevant threshold to convict individuals for felonies or other criminal offenses. It seems doubtful whether such a strict standard is appropriate here. The Tribunal decides an investment dispute under a treaty and does not exercise criminal jurisdiction. In addition, the relevant acts occurred around 20 years ago. It seems unlikely that a finding by the Tribunal that Estonia violated the FET standard would trigger criminal proceedings against former state officials.\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 141-142, *referring to Corfu Channel Case (UK v. Albania),* Merits, Judgment of 9 April 1949, ICJ Reports 1949, p. 4 (**RLA-142**).\n\n919.\n\nConsidering the above, the Tribunal is of the view that the appropriate standard of proof lies somewhere on the continuum between the balance of probabilities as a lenient standard and the exclusion of reasonable doubts as a very strict standard. Furthermore, the Tribunal agrees with the statement of the tribunal in *EDF v Romania* that the \"seriousness of the accusation of corruption\" matters.1456 In the view of the Tribunal, this requires a bespoke standard of proof based on the circumstances of the relevant case, including the nature of the allegations. The graver the accusations the more convincing the evidence must be for an international tribunal to find that a State incurs international responsibility for an alleged act of corruption.\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, \u00b6 221 (**RLA-133**).\n\n920.\n\nHere, the Claimant raises allegations against \"most senior Estonian officials\" and describes their acts as \"as outrageous [\u2026] reprehensible and unconscionable [\u2026] and shameful.\"1457 Assuming that the acts have indeed occurred, the Tribunal agrees with this characterization. Against this background, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to require that the evidence submitted in support of those accusations be \"clear and convincing\", a standard applied in *EDF v. Romania* as well.1458\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1270, 1679.\n\n*EDF (Services) Limited v. Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, \u00b6 221 (**RLA-133**).\n\n*(II.) Application of the Law to the Facts*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n921.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that no corrupt payments were made. The Claimant alleges, however, that Estonian officials attempted at three occasions to solicit corrupt payments. The Tribunal will now analyze whether there is clear and convincing evidence that one or more of these three attempts have indeed occurred.\n\n*(A.) The First Attempt*\n------------------------\n\n922.\n\nThe first attempt was allegedly a request for US$ 300,000 in exchange for ownership of the Port, made by Mr. Raivo Laus\u2014acting in collusion with Minister Rask\u2014at a meeting with Mr. Rotko on 11 March 2000. Mr. Rotko's account of the incident is as follows.\n\nI met with Mr. Laus in his car at a Shell petrol station across from my house on the morning of Saturday, March 11, 2000. It was very unusual to meet someone for a meeting in a car. I thought that the car radio was bugged and mentioned this suspicion to Mr. Laus. He laughed and turned off the radio.\n\nI was scared during this meeting. Mr. Laus said that ownership of the port could be transferred to an ELA subsidiary via a bankruptcy proceeding if ELA temporarily gave control of Verest, Agrin, and BPV to Mr. Laus and paid US$ 300,000 to Minister Rask. On Monday, March 13, 2000, a document was faxed to BPV from the Tallinn Ownership Reform Department. The document would have transferred the representation of our investments before the local courts from my current legal team to Mr. Laus. I refused to sign the document or accept his proposal.1459\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45 (**CWS-2**).\n\n923.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Mr. Rotko's account is corroborated by the timing of the Claimant's attempts to settle the lawsuit, and the chronology of events outlined in paragraph 905 above. The Tribunal has examined closely the documentary evidence in that regard and its findings are as follows.\n\n924.\n\nIf the alleged conversation between Mr. Laus and Mr. Rotko on 11 March 2000 took place, and Mr. Laus acted on behalf of Mr. Rask in his function as minister, then the Claimant's FET claim based on corruption would in the Tribunal's view be successful. The Tribunal will analyze first whether there is clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Laus acted on behalf of Mr. Rask.\n\n925.\n\nWhile the Claimant describes Mr. Laus as \"a lawyer who claimed to act for Minister Rask\"1460 and as \"Minister Rask's lawyer and advisor,\"1461 the Respondent denies that Mr. Laus ever worked for the government.1462 Mr. Rotko was unable to recall when he met Mr. Laus for the first time and how they were introduced.1463 There are three factual exhibits on file that mention the name of Mr. Laus. The Tribunal will address these documents in their chronological order.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 123.\n\nReply, \u00b6 853.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 585.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, pp. 25:15 \u2013 29:12.\n\n926.\n\nFirst, Mr. Laus's business card was apparently affixed to a letter dated 6 January 2000 from Verest and Agrin to Ehitusekspert (\"the **6 January 2000 Letter**\"), a company that provided an expert report regarding the assets at the Port dated 24 January 2000 (\"**the Ehitusekspert Report**\").1464 The Ehitusekspert Report was submitted in the Estonian court proceedings. The 6 January 2000 Letter was attached as an exhibit to that report and Mr. Laus's business card was apparently affixed to the letter before it was photocopied.1465 If anything, then this document seems to indicate that Mr. Laus has acted on behalf of Verest and Agrin in 2000, but it certainly does not offer support for the allegation that Mr. Laus was instructed by Minister Rusk.\n\nEhitusekspert Evaluation Report, 24 January 2000, p. 71 in the original Estonian version (**C-016**).\n\nEhitusekspert Evaluation Report, 24 January 2000, p. 71 in the original Estonian version (**C-016**).\n\n927.\n\nThe second document that mentions Mr. Laus' name is a Unibank comfort letter dated 9 February 2000 (\"**Unibank Letter**\"). This letter consists of a two-page fax addressed by Mr. Jens Kragh of Unibank to Mr. Rotko. Its first page reads as:\n\nDear Alexandr\n\nInteresting to hear about the privatization plans.\n\nPlease find enclosed our proposal of a bank reference on your company [..].1466\n\nUnibank Comfort Letter to Raivo Laus, 9 February 2000, p. 1 (**C-301**).\n\n928.\n\nThe second page of the Unibank Letter consists of the \"bank reference\" mentioned by Mr. Kragh. It is addressed to Mr. Laus and signed by Mr. Kragh and Mr. Hansen of Unibank. Its first sentence states that \"[a]t the request of ELA U.S.A Inc. we hereby provide you with a reference on the said company\".1467 Further, the letter states: \"ELA U.S.A. Inc. has been a customer of Unibank for approximately four years. Unibank A/S mainly provides deposit services for the company. There has been a substantial turnover on the account (approx. USD 5 million during the second half of 1999) and our experience has been satisfactory.\"1468 There is nothing in the letter that would support the proposition that Mr. Laus sought to solicit corrupt payments from the Claimant. Nor does the letter provide evidence in support of a connection between Mr. Laus and Mr. Rask.\n\nUnibank Comfort Letter to Raivo Laus, 9 February 2000, p. 2 (**C-301**).\n\nUnibank Comfort Letter to Raivo Laus, 9 February 2000, p. 2 (**C-301**).\n\n929.\n\nThe third document containing Mr. Laus's name is an unsigned power of attorney dated 13 March 2000 regarding a possible instruction of Mr. Laus by Verest, B&E, and Agrin.1469 The Respondent raises doubts concerning the authenticity and relevance of this document.1470 According to the Claimant, the power of attorney was drafted by Mr. Raivo Laus and sent to the Claimant. However, the document bears BPV's logo and its contact information in the footer, a discrepancy that Mr. Rotko was unable to explain.1471 The top line of the fax is cut off.1472 The power of attorney is only valid for two months. It does not mention the bankruptcy proceedings. It is not clear what connection the Tallinn Ownership Reform Department has to the case; Mr. Rotko testified that: \"We only used documents issued by the Municipal Reform 20 Department, as far as I can recall, in the lawsuit proceedings. And that's the extent of the relationship.\"1473 The Tribunal does not find this document to support the Claimant's allegations, neither as to an attempt to solicit payment, nor regarding Ms. Laus' alleged connection with Mr. Rask.\n\nVerest, Agrin, B&E authorization to lawyer Raivo Laus, 13 March 2000 (**C-062**); Hearing Transcript, Day 5, pp. 131:17 \u2013 132:10.\n\nVerest, Agrin, B&E authorization to lawyer Raivo Laus, 13 March 2000 (**C-062**); Hearing Transcript, Day 5, pp.131:17 \u2013 132:10.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 32:11-15.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 30:2-3 (question not answered).\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 31:2-21.\n\n930.\n\nAccording to Mr. Rotko, Mr. Laus told him that he was acting on behalf of Mr. Rask. Whether or not Mr. Laus made this statement is not decisive for the findings of the Tribunal. This is because the mere allegation by an attorney in a conversation with a potential client that he cooperates with a government official is no clear evidence that establishes the existence of such cooperation.\n\n931.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to the other documents relied on by the Claimant regarding the first attempt, none of which mention Mr. Laus.\n\n932.\n\nIn a letter of 15 December 1999 to the Ministry of Justice, Verest made a proposal to pay the sum of EEK 360,966, being the value of the contested property, in consideration of discontinuation of the court action.1474 The response from the Ministry of Justice, dated 12 January 2000,1475 stated that \"[t]he State Asset Act does not allow the transfer of state assets in the form suggested in your letter. In case the state assets are not necessary for [exercising] state power, then the transfer is only possible by a public auction based on the order of the Government of the Republic.\"1476 According to the Claimant, the representation that the Port could only be sold by public auction supports the allegation that Minister Rask sought a bribe for a transfer of ownership to be conducted via bankruptcy proceedings.1477 The Tribunal notes that the letter was not signed by Minister Rusk but by Mihkel Oviir, Chancellor of the Ministry of Justice. Moreover, a public auction based on statutory rules seems to be a more appropriate way to sell State assets than the discontinuance of court proceedings against payment by private parties.1478 Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the exchange of letters of 15 December 1999 and 12 January 2000 does not support the Claimant's allegations.\n\nLetter from Verest to the Ministry of Justice regarding settlement offer, 15 December 1999 (**C-058**). The letter was sent by Jevgeni Skljarov, board member of Verest. The letter states *inter alia* that \"all respondents [identified as Verest, B&E, Agrin in the first paragraph of the letter] have consolidated their interests and conducted a new business plan, which foreign investors have shown interest in\u2026[T]he value of action is 360 966 EEK. Respondents are willing to pay the state mentioned amount should the court action be discontinued. In case that the value of challenged property has changed, respondents are willing to negotiate the value of compensation.\"\n\nMinistry of Justice letter to Verest, 12 January 2000 (**C-059**).\n\nMinistry of Justice letter to Verest, 12 January 2000 (**C-059**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 493.\n\nMinistry of Justice letter to Verest, 12 January 2000 (**C-059**).\n\n933.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to the exchange of letters of 7 March 2000 and 24 April 2000. In the first letter, addressed to the Minister of Justice, Mr. Caroll\u2014then the Claimant's attorney based in Wisconsin\u2014set out several legal arguments and suggested engaging in negotiations instead of continuing the court proceedings.1479 The proposal was declined in the letter of the Ministry of Justice dated 24 April 2000, signed by Mihkel Oviir, who had already rejected the settlement offer of Verest of 15 December 1999.1480 The letter of 24 April 2000 stated that the Ministry of Justice had examined Mr. Caroll's letter, that the judicial proceedings were still ongoing, and that the Ministry of Justice did not agree with the proposal to settle the matter by means of negotiations.\n\nThe Tribunal finds neither the content of this letter nor its circumstances suspicious or unusual. Rather, the letter is consistent with the position of the Ministry of Justice taken before the alleged first corruption attempt of 11 March 2000, especially in the letter of 12 January 2000, namely that Estonia cannot give up its assets by way of a settlement in judicial proceedings.\n\nExchange of letters between Gerald Carroll, legal counsel for ELA USA, Inc., and Mihkel Oviir, Chancellor of the Ministry of Justice, of 7 March 2000 and 20 April 2000, pp. 1-3 (**C-061**).\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 932.\n\n934.\n\nConsidering the above, the documents on file do not support the Claimant's allegation that Mr. Laus\u2014acting on behalf of Minister Rask\u2014told Mr. Rotko that the Claimant could gain control over the Port through bankruptcy proceedings against payment of US$ 300,000. It is also unclear to the Tribunal how the alleged bribe would have worked. Not even the Claimant or Mr. Rotko could explain what the proposal to \"sell the port through bankruptcy proceedings\" would entail, who would declare bankruptcy, nor how such proceedings could be assured to lead to the Claimant acquiring ownership of the Port. Mr. Rotko, when asked about how the proposal would have worked, affirmed that he \"had no idea why bankruptcy was suggested\" or why Mr. Laus suggested that Mr. Rotko transfer control of the companies to him.1481\n\nTranscript, Day 2, p. 28:2-16.\n\n935.\n\nOverall, the Claimant's corruption allegations regarding the first attempt find their support merely in Mr. Rotko's testimony regarding a conversation between him and Mr. Laus on 11 March 2000. Even if Mr. Rotko's recollection of this alleged conversation is correct, there is no evidence that Mr. Laus indeed acted on behalf of Mr. Rask. The evidence on file regarding the first alleged attempt to solicit corrupt payment is therefore neither clear nor convincing.\n\n*(B.) The Second Attempt*\n-------------------------\n\n936.\n\nThe alleged second attempt at bribery was according to the Claimant also made by Mr. Laus. At the meeting in the lobby of the Hotel Olympia, Mr. Laus allegedly told Mr. Rotko that Mr. Rotko could become the owner of the Lennusadam Port and the neighboring Patarei prison if he made a payment of US$ 5,000,000, and that Mr. Laus could arrange for the Seaplane Hangar to be removed from the UNESCO cultural heritage list, so it could be destroyed if necessary.1482\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 155; Second Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 55-56 (**CWS-2**).\n\n937.\n\nWhen asked at the Hearing whether Mr. Laus offered any explanation for the price having increased compared to the first alleged attempt of 11 March 2000, Mr. Rotko stated:\n\nThere was no discussion about that. It was said that I should pay [$]5 million, and that will include not just the port but the neighboring territory with the prison and privatization. I do not pay too much attention to that, I don't ask for reasons. I just say, \"Okay, I will tell you my decision later,\" to avoid any physical danger.1483\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 37:16-22.\n\n938.\n\nMs. Olga Kotova confirms in her witness testimony that Mr. Rotko told her at the time about the second attempt:\n\nDuring the time that I was a board member for the ELA Estonian subsidiaries, Alex would provide me with updates on the litigation. He also told me about several instances in which Estonia asked him for bribes to drop the case. For example, Alex met with Raivo Laus, a lawyer who worked with then Minister of Justice M\u00e4rt Rask, at the Hotel Olympia in 2001. I was not a board member for the ELA Estonian investments yet, but I knew Alex. After his meeting with Mr. Laus, Alex and I met downtown, and he told me about the meeting. According to Alex, Mr. Laus said that Minister Rask would give Alex both the Port and the prison next door in return for a payment of US$5 million. Alex was scared and told me that he left the meeting without agreeing to anything.1484\n\nWitness Statement of Ms. Olga Kotova dated 29 August 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 (**CWS-3**).\n\n939.\n\nBut Ms. Kotova did not witness the meeting in person or provide any information regarding the alleged corruption attempt other than Mr. Rotko's account of it to her. According to the Claimant, later in the year, Mr. Laus again called Mr. Rotko and said that the Estonian government was willing to pay Mr. Rotko US$ 1,500,000 if he would recognize Estonia's ownership of the Lennusadam Port and his companies left the Port. Mr. Rotko rejected the offer and informed Mr. Laus that he had already invested much more than that into the Port.1485\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 157.\n\n940.\n\nThere is no documentary evidence on file regarding the second attempt, Moreover, Mr. Rotko's and Ms. Kotova's testimonies can at most establish that Mr. Laus told Mr. Rotko that he acted on behalf of Mr. Rask. This is far from constituting clear and convincing evidence in support of a corruption attempt attributable to the Estonian State.\n\n*(C.) The Third Attempt*\n------------------------\n\n941.\n\nUnlike the first two attempts, the alleged third attempt does not involve Mr. Laus. The alleged meeting of 5 June 2006 took place two days before the Supreme Court of Estonia dismissed the appeals of the Claimant's subsidiaries in the ownership lawsuit.\n\n942.\n\nMr. Rotko's account of the meeting is as follows. The meeting was requested by a telephone call to Mr. Rotko \"from a secret police agent\" and was arranged at a Turkish caf\u00e9.1486 At this caf\u00e9, Mr. Rotko met with two individuals whom he assumed to be \"secret agents\" based on their behavior and haircuts.1487 The agents told Mr. Rotko that he could privatize the Port if he declared bankruptcy. Mr. Rotko described the (limited) information he was allegedly provided with regarding those bankruptcy proceedings as follows:1488\n\nQ. Did the secret agents ask you to pay a bribe?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Then what was the purpose of the meeting?\n\nA. For my company BPV, that owned, well, all the companies in the port, to go through bankruptcy. And one of them said, \"This person will be the bankruptcy manager. He's a good guy; he's a little fat. He's got military -- shaped as a military man\", and he spoke with an Estonian accent. And they suggested that I should go through bankruptcy and everything would be fine. The premises of the port, I will get them in my possession through bankruptcy proceedings: that's what they said.\n\nQ. What was their interest in the whole deal then?\n\nA. It was Rask's interest, I believe, because he wanted to somehow put the company into bankruptcy, as he always has said.\n\nSecond Rotko Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 65-67; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, pp. 15:17 \u2013 16:19.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, pp. 37:23 \u2013 38:4.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 38:10-25.\n\n943.\n\nAccording to Mr. Rotko, he refused to agree with this plan, upon which\u2014outside the caf\u00e9\u2014the agents made a telephone call to a person whom Mr. Rotko identified as Minister Rask:\n\nThey stepped away, literally 3 feet away from me, placed a phone call. It was already outside the caf\u00e9, we had stepped out of the caf\u00e9. They called Rask. Why am I saying Rask? It's because I did hear his voice. He has a very distinctive kind of voice. I had met with him, and I heard his voice while I was next to him. They said that I had turned down the offer and he told them to convey to me that my port had already been taken away.1489\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 16:8-16.\n\n944.\n\nThere are no documents on file containing further information on the identity of the alleged agents for the Tribunal to address. The only means to ascertain their identity and connection to the State of Estonia remains Mr. Rotko's testimony. However, Mr. Rotko was unable to provide names, and assumed their role based on their appearance and body language. No documentary evidence on record suggests that the persons allegedly present at the Turkish caf\u00e9 were \"secret police agents\" or any other kind of agents acting on behalf of the State. Mr. Rotko testifies that he identified Minister Rask's voice by overhearing a phone call outdoors from three feet away. The Tribunal does not consider such a form of identification very reliable. It surely does not constitute clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Rask offered Mr. Rotko ownership of the Port through bankruptcy proceedings against payment of a bribe.\n\n*(D.) Allegedly similar incidents*\n----------------------------------\n\n945.\n\nThe Claimant wishes to draw inferences from the \"history\" or general environment of corruption in Estonia. The 2006 Rail World and 2021 Porto Franco Cases are, however, unrelated to the present proceedings.1490 In the Rail World Case, the record shows only an unspecific, uncorroborated, and unproven allegation made by an aggrieved investor in an unrelated case. The events in the 2021 Porto Franco Case postdate the Claimant's involvement in Estonia by almost two decades and are not connected to the Claimant's investment.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 36-43, 880.\n\n946.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal considers that there is no clear and convincing evidence in support of the alleged attempt to solicit corrupt payments by individuals whose conduct would be attributable to Estonia and therefore rejects the Claimant's FET claim based on corruption.\n\n**b) Alleged Unlawful Interference in the Judicial Process**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. The Claimant's Position*\n----------------------------\n\n947.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent unlawfully interfered in the judicial process when its executive branch attempted to influence the outcome of the local proceedings against Agrin, Verest and BPV on at least two occasions during the pendency of those proceedings,1491 namely through (1) disciplinary proceedings against judge J\u00fcri Mesipuu, and (2) statements made by the Minister of Justice in a televised interview.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 497.\n\n948.\n\nConcerning the legal standard, the Claimant contends that the broadest possible protections are necessary \"to cover the judicial branch with the protections of the rule of law\". According to the Claimant, such protections would be weakened by the application of a \"special and higher standard of proof\".1492 It submits that such an approach as taken in *Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela* would \"weaken protections for the rule of law\" and is contrary to the fundamental concept of breach of treaty obligation under Article 2 of the ILC Articles, which does not establish a special threshold rule for cases involving judicial independence.1493\n\nReply, \u00b6 364.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 265-266, *citing* Article 2 of the ILC Articles, (**CLA-137**).\n\n*(I.) Disciplinary Proceedings*\n-------------------------------\n\n949.\n\nIn November 2000, the Minister of Justice initiated disciplinary proceedings before the Disciplinary Committee against Judge J\u00fcri Mesipuu of the Tallinn City Court, alleging that there had been undue delay in the referred local proceedings.1494 The Disciplinary Committee rejected the complaint and emphasized that the Ministry of Justice \"in [that] disciplinary matter [had] derailed from the principles of objectivity and equality of the parties.\"1495\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 498, *referring to* Rask Started Disciplinary Proceedings Against Judge, Baltic News Service, 20 November 2000 (**C-072**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 499, *citing* Decision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, \u00b6 5 (**C-122**).\n\n950.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, while Minister Rask decided not to appeal the decision of the Disciplinary Committee,1496 his actions in bringing the complaint against Judge Mesipuu were cited in a 2001 report by George Soros' Open Society Institute on Judicial Independence in Estonia. The report stated:\n\nThe Minister of Justice continues to exercise a predominant influence on the administration of the judiciary and supervision of court presidents, affording it opportunities indirectly to influence judges' deliberations. [\u2026] As long as the district and regional courts are under the supervision of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry will have opportunities to exert undue influence on the judges and especially the President of the courts through its discretionary administrative decisions. For example, the Minister of Justice recently initiated disciplinary action against a judge for unduly prolonging administrative court proceedings in a highly publicized case in which the Government was a party.1497\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 143, *citing* News Article. Rask will not appeal the decision of the committee about Judge Mesipuu. 9 February 2001 (**C-127**)*.*\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 143, *citing* Open Society Institute, 'Judicial Independence in Estonia' in *Monitoring the EU Accession Process-Judicial Independence*, 2001, p. 164 (**C-128**). In this report, the Disciplinary Committee is referred to as the \"Disciplinary Commission.\"\n\n951.\n\nThe Claimant states that \"[t]he public opprobrium caused by the transparency from the Open Societies Project made the other judges more careful in finding arguments that pleased the Government. Further, the judges did not veer from the Government's goal of economic capital punishment.\"1498\n\nReply, \u00b6 377.\n\n*(II.) Remarks by the Minister of Justice*\n------------------------------------------\n\n952.\n\nThe Claimant claims that on 5 April 2004, the Minister of Justice, Minister Ken-Marti Vaher, stated in a televised interview that local courts should rule that the Port was State property.1499 The Claimant alleges that, in the same interview, the Minister also stated that the judge of the Tallinn City Court who was responsible for the procedural error that led to the first judgment being quashed by the Circuit Court would be \"held responsible.\"1500\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 502, *referring to* Transcript of Justice Minister Vaher on Actuaalne Kaamera TV Program, 5 April 2004 (**C-209**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 503, *referring to* Transcript of Justice Minister Vaher on Actuaalne Kaamera TV Program, 5 April 2004 (**C-209**).\n\n953.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the above acts by the Respondent frustrated its expectation of a stable business and regulatory environment, constituted an abuse of process and violated the principles of due process and good faith, and therefore, breached the FET standard.1501\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 505; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1268-1271.\n\n*ii. The Respondent's Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n954.\n\nRelying on *Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela*, the Respondent submits that \"[a]ny allegations of partiality by the courts due to alleged governmental pressure must be proven to the highest standard of proof.\"1502 The Respondent characterizes the Claimant's pleadings on this point as an argument that the Respondent \"misunderstood the severity of the allegations and that the sanctioning of Judge Mesipuu and a TV appearance by the Minister of Justice must have had a specific and direct effect on the courts.\"1503\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 575, *referring to Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6, Award, 16 January 2013, \u00b6 228 (**RLA-140**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 422.\n\n955.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's allegations in this regard do not reach the threshold of that standard.1504 The Respondent contends that \"[t]here is no reason to believe that the courts were in any way influenced by the actions of government representatives.\"1505 According to the Respondent, Estonian courts afforded Agrin, Verest and BPV a fair opportunity to present their case and make full use of their rights and rendered \"an independent and well-reasoned verdict.\"1506\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 576; Rejoinder, \u00b6 421.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 576.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 576.\n\n956.\n\nAs for the conduct of the Ministry of Justice, the Respondent asserts that this branch of the government acted as a private party in the proceedings against Agrin, Verest and BPV \"to protect its rights\" and \"used the legal remedies available to it.\"1507\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 573.\n\n*(I.) Disciplinary Proceedings*\n-------------------------------\n\n957.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Minister of Justice \"had a lawful and reasonable basis\" to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Tallinn City Court judge J\u00fcri Mesipuu.1508 According to the Respondent, the Minister, which has the authority to initiate that type of proceedings, relied on a breach of section 19(1)(1) of the Status of Judges Act for undue delay.1509 The Respondent contends that Judge J\u00fcri Mesipuu had taken several months to rule on a request for interim measures that, under Estonian law, should have been resolved within one day.1510 In any event, the Respondent argues that the disciplinary proceedings could not have influenced Judge Mesipuu's decision as such proceedings were initiated after the Tallinn City Court's judgment of 20 November 2000 was rendered.1511\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 578; Rejoinder, \u00b6 421.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 578, *referring to* Status of Judges Act (Eesti Vabariigi kohtuniku staatuse seadus), RT 1991, 38, 473, section 21 (**RLA-141**). *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 421.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 578; Rejoinder, \u00b6 421.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 579, *referring to* August 2000 Judgment (**C-068**); Decision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, \u00b6 3.1 (**C-122**).\n\n*(II.) Public Remarks by Minister of Justice*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n958.\n\nAs for the public statements made by Minister Ken-Marti Vaher in the televised interview of 5 April 2004, the Respondent submits that the Claimant must, and has failed to, show that these had a specific and direct effect on the process or outcome of the court proceedings.1512 According to the Respondent, there is no reason to believe that the courts were in any way influenced by the actions of government representatives; rather, the Tallinn City Court's actions that succeeded the public statements identified by the Claimant confirm that the court acted impartially.1513 Specifically, the Respondent maintains that after the referred statements took place in 2004, the Tallinn City Court decided in 2005 to reject the Respondent's claim against BPV.1514 Although this decision was overturned on appeal, the Respondent avers that had the Tallinn City Court been \"swayed by the media coverage\" then \"the proceedings would surely have been conducted in a shorter timeframe and with a more positive outcome for the Respondent.\"1515\n\nCounter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 574-576; Rejoinder, \u00b6 422.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 577.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 577, *referring to* July 2005 Judgment (**C-078**).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 577.\n\n*iii. The Tribunal's Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n*(I.) Legal Standard*\n---------------------\n\n959.\n\nThe US-Estonia BIT does not expressly mention or define \"unlawful interference.\" The illegality must relate to a breach of international law. Not every illegality under domestic law constitutes a treaty breach. Some degree of inefficiency, trial and error, or human imperfection must be overstepped before a party may complain of a violation of a BIT, or else \"every aspect of any legislation of a host state or its implementation could be brought before an international arbitral tribunal under the guise of a violation of the BIT,\" which is not the purpose of such treaties.1516 As in the case of the NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunal in *SD Myers*, this Tribunal:\n\ndoes not have an open-ended mandate to second-guess government decision-making. Governments have to make many potentially controversial choices. In doing so, they may appear to have made mistakes, to have misjudged the facts, proceeded on the basis of a misguided economic or sociological theory, placed too much emphasis on some social values over others and adopted solutions that are ultimately ineffective or counterproductive. The ordinary remedy, if there were one, for errors in modern governments is through internal political and legal processes, including elections.1517\n\n*Eastern Sugar B.V. v Czech Republic*, SCC Case No. 088/2004, Partial Award, 27 March 2007, \u00b6 272 (**CLA-266**).\n\n*S.D.

Government of Canada*, First Partial Award, 2000 WL 34510032, 13 November 2000, \u00b6 261 (**CLA-048**).\n\n960.\n\nState conduct that is not in violation of specific regulations may be recognized as being contrary to the law because: \"(it) shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.\"1518 The test is not whether the host State met a standard of \"perfection\"1519 or its legal system was performing as efficiently as it ideally could.1520\n\n*Tecnicas Mediambientales Tecmed S.A. v. the United Mexican States,* ICSID Case no.

Myers*, *Mondev*, *ADF* and *Loewen* cases.\n\n962.\n\nInternationally unlawful conduct of judicial proceedings was found, for example, in an arbitration under NAFTA where the trial court \"permitted the jury to be influenced by persistent appeals to local favoritism as against a foreign litigant,\" conduct held to be \"improper and discreditable and cannot be squared with minimum standards of international law and fair and equitable treatment.\"1523\n\n*Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, 26 June 2003, \u00b6 136 (**CLA-088**).\n\n963.\n\nThe standard of proof in a claim that the judiciary lacked independence insofar as they were influenced by actions of the executive of the State has also been described as particularly high.\n\n964.\n\nThe case of *Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela* concerned an alleged breach of the right to fair and equitable treatment through obstruction of access to the courts in judicial proceedings to which the State was a party. The tribunal found failures of the courts to deal with applications for interim relief promptly or at all, as well as considerable and multiple delays in dealing with applications.1524 The investor alleged that the courts \"were less than independent and impartial and were acting against the background of political controversy.\"1525 Endorsing the high threshold formulated in other cases, the tribunal held:\n\nThe question is not whether the host State legal system is performing as efficiently as it ideally could: it is whether it is performing so badly as to violate treaty obligations to accord fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. The Tribunal does not consider that the delays in this case are of an order that constitutes conduct that falls below the minimum standard demanded by the Treaty.\n\nAllegations of a lack of independence and impartiality are more difficult to deal with. They often amount to **allegations of violations of professional rules, or even of criminal laws, and it is not to be expected that evidence will be readily available**. Such allegations would, if proven, constitute very serious violations of the State's treaty obligations. **But they must be properly proved; and the proof must, at least ordinarily, relate to the specific cases in which the impropriety is alleged to have occurred. Inferences of a serious and endemic lack of independence and impartiality in the judiciary, drawn from an examination of other cases or from anecdotal or circumstantial evidence, will not ordinarily suffice** to prove an allegation of impropriety in a particular case. The evidence in this case does not warrant a conclusion that the decisions of the courts in Venezuela in the proceedings instituted by Claimant demonstrate a lack of independence or impartiality, and the Tribunal does not accept that they amount to breaches of either the right to fair and equitable treatment or the right to full protection and security.\"1526\n\n*Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6, Award, 16 January 2013, \u00b6 226 (**RLA-140**).\n\n*Vannessa Ventures v.

Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6, Award, 16 January 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 227-228 (**RLA-140**) (emphasis added).\n\n965.\n\nThe Claimant has questioned whether the standard of proof adopted in *Vannessa Ventures* is appropriate because safeguarding the ability of judges to rule against the government \"necessitates the broadest possible international protections \u2013 not a rule protecting states that engage in punishment of judges who rule against government policy\".1527 The Claimant submits that such an approach conflates the fair and equitable treatment standard with the requirements to establish a denial of justice.1528\n\nReply, \u00b6 368.\n\nReply, \u00b6 369.\n\n966.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is appropriate to require specific proof in relation to allegations of a lack of judicial independence and impartiality, wherein anecdotal or circumstantial evidence would not suffice. It is not an extraordinarily high standard to accept that \"the proof must, at least ordinarily, relate to the specific cases in which the impropriety is alleged to have occurred.\"1529 As held in *Vannessa Ventures,* establishing unlawful interference with the judiciary would require a showing of the effect on the conduct of the judiciary towards the Claimant.1530 It is logical that the evidentiary requirements would be similar under the related standard of denial of justice.\n\n*Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6, Award, 16 January 2013, \u00b6 228 (**RLA-140**).\n\n*Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6, Award, 16 January 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 227-228 (**RLA-140**).\n\n967.\n\nIn substance, certain principles articulated in the concept of denial of justice claims are relevant to the Claimant's case. The actionable element of unlawful interference in judicial proceedings is a lack of access to independent and impartial justice. Cases on expropriation through a denial of justice have applied the principle that where an investor had the opportunity to seek remedial action in the courts of the host State, the decision that could have been so challenged does not amount to a denial of justice.1531 Failure to seek redress from national authorities has been held capable of disqualifying an international claim, \"not because there is a requirement of exhaustion of local remedies but because the very reality of conduct tantamount to expropriation is doubtful in the absence of a reasonable - not necessarily exhaustive - effort by the investor to obtain correction.\"1532 Similarly, the availability of local remedies to an investor has been held relevant to the question of State compliance with a standard such as \"treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security\" under Article 1105(1) of NAFTA.1533\n\n*Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.

Mexico (II)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, \u00b6 116 (**CLA-066**).\n\n968.\n\nIf the mere availability of a challenge would preclude a finding of denial of justice or breach of the right to fair and equitable treatment, it follows *a fortiori* that a successful challenge has the same effect, as implied by the tribunal in *EnCana v. Ecuador*. In considering a claim of expropriation through breach of contract, the Tribunal distinguished \"a questionable position taken by the executive in relation to a matter governed by the local law\" from \"a definitive determination contrary to law.\"1534 It held that the mere refusal to make a payment would not constitute an expropriation of the value of the payment \"provided at least that (a) the refusal is not merely willful, (b) the courts are open to the aggrieved private party, (c) the courts' decisions are not themselves overridden or repudiated by the State.\"1535 A potential claim for unlawful interference may no longer arise should the alleged defect have been remedied in the judicial system of the host State.\n\n*EnCana Corporation v.

The Disciplinary Proceedings*\n-----------------------------------\n\n969.\n\nThe Disciplinary Committee, sitting in panels of three to five judges, may apply sanctions, including reprimand, warning, or a fine. A judge whose behavior is examined has the right to be heard, the right to legal assistance, and the right to appeal to the Supreme Court where appeals are heard by the Supreme Court *en banc.*1536\n\nOpen Society Institute, 'Judicial Independence in Estonia' in *Monitoring the EU Accession Process-Judicial Independence*, 2001, p. 179, *citing* Statute of the Disciplinary Committee adopted by the Supreme Court and available at , in Estonian (accessed 11 June 2001) (**C-128**).\n\n970.\n\nIn the proceeding against Judge Mesipuu, the Ministry of Justice alleged (i) that the judge failed to rule on the request for interim relief by the deadline set in section 158 subsection 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure; (ii) that he unduly delayed the proceedings by taking over two years for the decision; and (iii) that he irresponsibly departed on vacation without notification of the need for urgent decisions or leaving access to the case file. However, the Ministry itself submitted that the latter two allegations do not amount to disciplinary offences, but rather showed shortcomings in the judge's work.1537\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, \u00b6 2 (**C-122**).\n\n971.\n\nThe Ministry had therefore initiated disciplinary proceedings on the basis of three claims, two of which the Ministry itself did not even find to be prosecutable (which raises the question of why they started the proceedings in the first place, if not to pressure the judiciary) and the third was essentially an unfounded protest against a decision that was disadvantageous to the ministry. In view of this, the Disciplinary Committee found that it was the Ministry of Justice who had acted improperly: \"The disciplinary committee also finds that the Ministry of Justice has in this disciplinary matter derailed from the principles of objectivity and equality of the parties.\"1538\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, \u00b6 5 (**C-122**).\n\n972.\n\nThe Disciplinary Committee dismissed the first charge: it found that the judge had simply denied the request for interim relief, not failed to rule on it. As to the second charge, the Ministry submitted that the proceeding \"lasted for over two and a half years\" and thereby \"exceeded the limit of reasonable time.\"1539 The Disciplinary Committee dismissed this claim, finding that the length of the proceeding \"was not caused by the wrongful activities of the judge but rather the activities of the parties,\" given *inter alia* that, as accepted by the Ministry of Justice during the hearing, the plaintiff did not prove the necessary authorization until 11 August 2000.1540\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, \u00b6 1 (**C-122**).\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, \u00b6 4.1 (**C-122**).\n\n973.\n\nAs to the complaint that the judge had been \"very irresponsible\" in taking a vacation of one month without arranging for the case to be attended to timeously,1541 the Ministry of Justice pursued \"a minimal punishment\" and considered that the two-year time period taken and the failure to transfer the file during vacation \"do not constitute a disciplinary offence but show shortcomings in the work of Judge Mesipuu.\"1542 As to the fact that the civil file could not be retrieved in a timely manner during Judge Mesipuu's vacation, the Disciplinary Committee reviewed the internal processes leading to that delay, which were hampered by unforeseen illness and internal lapses in communication among the responsible administrative staff. It concluded that the delay was not the fault of Judge Mesipuu, who \"did not have to foresee\" those issues.1543\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, \u00b6 1.3 (**C-122**).\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, \u00b6 2 (**C-122**).\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, \u00b6 4.2 (**C-122**).\n\n974.\n\nConcerning the conduct of the Ministry of Justice, and having received submissions on this point from Judge Mesipuu and from Verest and Agrin, the Disciplinary Committee found that the Ministry of Justice had \"derailed from the principles of objectivity and equality of the parties.\" It stated:\n\nThe disciplinary matter has been started in a civil case in which the Ministry of Justice is a party to and by the time the disciplinary proceeding was started, a court decision in that matter had not entered into force. This situation reasonably gives a basis to think that the Ministry of Justice has tried to influence the judge with non-procedural instruments; the applying of which is made possible by the Status of the Judges Act, however, the other party of the proceeding does not have these possibilities. The reasoning of this conclusion is also proven with the letter sent by the representative of AS Verest and O\u00dc Agrin Partion, lawyer Heiki Ojamaa, on 19. January 2001.1544\n\nDecision of the Disciplinary Committee, Disciplinary matter No. 3-8-11-1, 1 February 2001, \u00b6 5 (**C-122**).\n\n975.\n\nIn an interview with ETA, Minister Rask stated that he did not deem it necessary to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.1545\n\nNews Article. Rask will not appeal the decision of the committee about Judge Mesipuu. February 9, 2001 (**C-127**)*.*\n\n976.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the disciplinary proceeding had no impact on the outcome of the proceedings before the Tallinn City Court because the judgment had already been passed on 25 August 2000, i.e., before the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings. The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument. While judgment at first instance had been passed, the ownership lawsuit remained pending prior to the decision by the Tallinn Circuit Court. The demonstration by the Minister of Justice to commence disciplinary proceedings in a case to which the government was a party certainly had the potential to affect the lawsuit in the same case.\n\n977.\n\nIn its 2001 report, the Open Society Institute cited the fact that \"the Minister of Justice recently initiated disciplinary action against a judge for unduly prolonging administrative court proceedings in a highly publicized case in which the Government was a party\"1546 in stating that the Ministry \"continues to exercise a predominant influence on the administration of the judiciary and supervision of court presidents, affording it opportunities indirectly to influence judges' deliberations.\"1547 In relation to potential law reform, the report stated:\n\nAs long as the district and regional courts are under the supervision of the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry will have opportunities to exert undue influence on the judges and especially the Presidents of the courts through its discretionary administrative decisions.1548\n\nOpen Society Institute, 'Judicial Independence in Estonia' in *Monitoring the EU Accession Process-Judicial Independence*, 2001, p. 164 (**C-128**).\n\nOpen Society Institute, 'Judicial Independence in Estonia' in *Monitoring the EU Accession Process-Judicial Independence*, 2001, p. 164, *citing* Statute of the Ministry of Justice, RTI 1997, 1, 7, RTI 2001, 8, 39; Sections 8, 12 (**C-128**).\n\nOpen Society Institute, 'Judicial Independence in Estonia' in *Monitoring the EU Accession Process-Judicial Independence*, 2001, p. 164, *citing* Statute of the Ministry of Justice, RTI 1997, 1, 7, RTI 2001, 8, 39; Sections 8, 12 (**C-128**).\n\n978.\n\nThe Open Society Institute concluded that the fact that proceedings are actually heard by the Disciplinary Committee, whose members are selected only by the courts, \"mitigates this potential harm to some degree,\"1549 and concluded that:\n\nIn practice the Ministry of Justice has not abused these powers; however, in some cases judges have reported that the Ministry has informed them of its interest in speeding up proceedings.1550\n\nOpen Society Institute, 'Judicial Independence in Estonia' in *Monitoring the EU Accession Process-Judicial Independence*, 2001, p. 180 (**C-128**).\n\nOpen Society Institute, 'Judicial Independence in Estonia' in *Monitoring the EU Accession Process-Judicial Independence*, 2001, p. 165 (**C-128**).\n\n979.\n\nIt may well be criticized that in Estonia, the Minister of Justice has the power to initiate disciplinary proceedings against judges (even if the Ministry of Justice itself is a party to the proceedings), as does the Open Society Institute. This being said, the Claimant must show that the impact of the disciplinary proceedings led to an outcome that would rise to a breach of the FET standard. In particular, allegations of a lack of independence and impartiality, as noted above:\n\nmust be properly proved; and the proof must, at least ordinarily, relate to the specific cases in which the impropriety is alleged to have occurred. Inferences of a serious and endemic lack of independence and impartiality in the judiciary, drawn from an examination of other cases or from anecdotal or circumstantial evidence, will not ordinarily suffice to prove an allegation of impropriety in a particular case.1551\n\n*Vannessa Ventures v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6, Award, 16 January 2013, \u00b6 228 (**RLA-140**).\n\n980.\n\nThe evidence does give cause for concern in this specific situation. The use of the Minister's authority to instigate disciplinary proceedings in a case to which the State was a party and represented by the same Ministry was reproachful. The disciplinary proceedings were heard independently, mitigating the potential for harm. A reproach of the same conduct was administered by the Disciplinary Committee in its decision on the case. In response to that decision, the Minister stated that he did not intend to appeal against it and that he was prepared to apologize to the Judge.\n\n981.\n\nIn establishing whether the conduct was \"unlawful\" under international law:\n\nA violation of a BIT does not only occur through blatant and outrageous interference. However, a BIT may also not be invoked each time the law is flawed or not fully and properly implemented by a state. Some attempt to balance the interests of the various constituents within a country, some measure of inefficiency, a degree of trial and error, a modicum of human imperfection must be overstepped before a party may complain of a violation of a BIT. Otherwise, every aspect of any legislation of a host state or its implementation could be brought before an international arbitral tribunal under the guise of a violation of the BIT. This is obviously not what BITs are for.1552\n\n*Eastern Sugar B.V. v Czech Republic*, SCC Case No. 088/2004, Partial Award, 27 March 2007, \u00b6 272 (**CLA-266**).\n\n982.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the decisive question is whether the decision of the Disciplinary Committee adequately redressed the harm, occasioned by the proceedings against Judge Mesipuu, which could amount to a lack of judicial independence in this specific case. If so, in the Tribunal's view, this conduct would not form the basis of a claim under the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.\n\n983.\n\nIn making this assessment, it is appropriate to refer to the legal standard on denial of justice (discussed above). In cases where a remedy under domestic law was available, tribunals have ruled that the conduct does not rise to a breach of the right to fair and equitable treatment. It follows *a fortiori* that where a remedy was available and was successfully used to correct the irregularity, the conduct of the State does not amount to a violation of international law.\n\n984.\n\nNotably, the independent review citing the case of Judge Mesipuu as an example did not conclude that the situations it had examined amounted to an abuse of power. It opined that while reform of the procedure was warranted, the potential for harm under the existing system is mitigated by the fact that disciplinary proceedings are heard by a Disciplinary Committee appointed by and comprising independent judges. The Open Societies report concerns the Estonian judicial system as a whole,1553 and evaluates *inter alia* whether draft legislation is sufficient to achieve the reforms it identifies as advisable.1554 In that connection, it is not the mandate of this Tribunal to second-guess the decision-making of the Government; the proper avenue for redress of such issues in modern governments is \"through internal political and legal processes, including elections.\"1555\n\nOpen Society Institute, 'Judicial Independence in Estonia' in *Monitoring the EU Accession Process-Judicial Independence*, 2001, Executive Summary, pp. 150-153 (**C-128**).\n\nOpen Society Institute, 'Judicial Independence in Estonia' in *Monitoring the EU Accession Process-Judicial Independence*, 2001, p. 164, *citing* Statute of the Ministry of Justice, RTI 1997, 1, 7, RTI 2001, 8, 39; Sections 8, 12, and stating: \"The draft Courts Act does little to address executive involvement.\" (**C-128**).\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, 2000 WL 34510032, First Partial Award, 13 November 2000, \u00b6 261 (**CLA-048**).\n\n985.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the actual or apparent lapses in the administration of justice were adequately remedied by the Disciplinary Commission's decision to dismiss the proceedings, the declaration made therein, and the subsequent public statements of the Minister. The Tribunal concludes that the conduct of the State did not amount to unlawful interference.\n\n*(B.) Public Remarks by Minister*\n---------------------------------\n\n986.\n\nOn 5 April 2004, Minister Ken-Marti Vaher carried out a visit to the Seaplane Harbor and at 9pm that evening, appeared on the television program *Aktuaalne Kaamera* where he was interviewed for comments. The relevant parts of the interview, in the context of the questions to which the Minister was responding, are as follows:\n\nPresenter: A president, several Ministers and Mayors have dealt with this situation. From today it is different, isn't it?\n\nMinister: The difference starting from today is the fact that we now have quite a clear overview of what exactly has happened in the Seaplane Harbor. What are the buildings that have been built after the prohibition to do so? Third, we have quite a clear plan on how to act hereinafter. We will definitely use all of the legal possibilities to reclaim the ownership of the State of the assets the value of which is in tens of millions of Kroon's. When speaking about the court proceeding, the next process takes place on 21. April. For sure, they will again try to use the delaying tactic but I think we should use significantly more of the opportunities provided in law, for example-compelled attendance. That the people delaying would stop these activities and the Republic of Estonia would restore its ownership on that territory.\n\nPresenter: Today, then, just some new knowledge? Today nothing was done for the territory to be released? This visitation by the Ministry of Justice should show to the court what the decision should be?\n\nMinister: I think it was a very clear signal by the State, by all the institutions of the state who have a joint opinion about this dispute. These are state assets that are in unlawful possession, the reclaiming of which is just a question of time and we have extremely strong arguments and are using all the possibilities to end this situation as soon as possible. Last year, we took steps to expedite the court processes. The lasting of the court proceeding has decreased by a month compared to 2002. We will use these methods hereinafter. Therefore, the goal is to finish the court proceeding as fast as possible and to monitor very carefully, what is happening in the Seaplane Harbor. The bailiff will definitely visit this object more often, to monitor the condition of the state assets. We want to ensure with all legal means that the situation would be as uncomfortable as possible for the unlawful possessors.\n\nPresenter: The content of the dispute is the fact whether the assets are state assets or not, isn't it?\n\nMinister: No. The content of the dispute is the illegal possession. Quite shady transactions that were concluded in the middle of the 90's and pursuant to the Constitution and Civil Procedure act this final truth can be proven in court. Our arguments are strong. We have managed to win these companies once in 2000.1556 Then, unfortunately, some processual errors were made and it was sent back to the court of first instance. Therefore, [overspeaking] there is no question regarding the substance. The question is only in time, that the law would win.\n\nPresenter: Have the people who made errors been punished?\n\nMinister: They will definitely be made held responsible.\n\nPresenter: How much longer will the dispute last? Will it go the European Court, or the bailiff will go and look for a few years whether something is happening or not?\n\nMinister: I, as a Ministry of Justice, want to do everything in my power so that the dispute would end as soon as possible. Of course, I cannot state a time limit, because the judicial power is the third power in the State.1557\n\nJudgment of the Tallinn City Court dated 25 August 2000. *See* May 2002 Appeal Judgment (**C-191**).\n\nTranscript of Justice Minister Vaher on Actuaalne Kaamera TV Program, 5 April 2004 (**C-209**).\n\n987.\n\nAs to the statements opining that the courts should rule in Estonia's favor, in the Tribunal's view, these were the Minister's accurate restatement of the State's position in the proceedings, as was taken in the courts. As a litigant in the proceedings, it was not improper to make a public statement of the position taken in therein; the action being taken to address the delays that had arisen and enforcing what the Ministry of Justice considered to be the legal status of property of the Republic of Estonia. It was open to Mr. Rotko to do the same.\n\n988.\n\nConcerning the statement that \"the people who made errors\" would be \"held responsible\", the Tribunal does find that this may be inappropriate in tone when publicly making what could be interpreted as a reference to the conduct of the judiciary. At the same time, neither the question nor the Minister's answer made specific mention of the judges who issued the first Tallinn City Court judgment. The Minister concluded by recognizing that \"the judicial power is the third power in the State\". The Tribunal does not find that his statements were a \"clear\" message that the courts \"should rule in their favor or face repercussions.\"1558 Any \"threat\" was a matter of intimation. There is no evidence that these statements had the potential to influence the courts.\n\nReply, \u00b6 503.\n\n989.\n\nNotably, in substance, the procedural errors in question went to the disadvantage of the Claimant's subsidiaries, Agrin and Verest, as well as their predecessor in possession of the port, B&E. It was those parties who took action to seek redress of those procedural errors in their appeal to the Tallinn Circuit Court, and who were successful in their appeal.1559\n\nMay 2002 Appeal Judgment (**C-191**). The Claimant's subsidiaries established procedural errors on the basis of: (i) failure to pass judgment on or consider all the claims in the counterclaim of O\u00dc B&E, in contravention of section 228 and subsection 231(4) of the Code of Civil Procedure; (ii) failure to fulfil the aims of the pre-trial proceeding through clarifying the claims of the plaintiff, the objection of the defendants, and the evidence to be provided in contravention of Section 164 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and (iii) failure to establish the wishes of the participants for adjudicating the matter collegially, in contravention of clause 164(1)95) of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n990.\n\nOn the whole, the procedural errors did not go to the disadvantage of the Respondent in particular. Any disadvantage occasioned by the delay between 14 November 1997 (the date of the action), 25 August 2000 (the date of the judgment quashed), and 5 April 2004 (the date of the Minister's remarks) did not affect the Respondent any more than it did the other parties. Further circumstantial evidence suggests that the courts were not influenced by the remarks. The judgment of the court of first instance in 2005 initially rejected the claim of Estonia against BPV. The courts thereby did not make the most positive possible ruling for Estonia.1560 To the extent that inferences are to be drawn from the facts, and as argued by the Respondent, it is reasonable to suppose that had the media comments unduly swayed the courts, Estonia would have prevailed more fully.\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment (**C-078**).\n\n991.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not substantiated its allegation of lack of judicial independence with proof relating specifically to the alleged improprieties. Neither the disciplinary proceedings against Judge J\u00fcri Mesipuu of the Tallinn City Court in November 2000 nor the public remark by the Minister of Justice Ken-Marti Vaher on 5 April 2004 constituted a breach of FET through unlawful interference in the conduct of the ownership lawsuit proceedings.\n\n**c) Alleged Denial of Justice / Breach of the Effective Means Requirement**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. The Claimant's Position*\n----------------------------\n\n992.\n\nThe Claimant submits that investment tribunals have consistently held that the due process component of the FET Standard may be breached when it is determined that the conduct of a host State amounted to a denial of justice.1561 Quoting the *Chevron I v. Ecuador* tribunal, the Claimant posits that the test for establishing denial of justice \"requires demonstration of 'a particularly serious shortcoming' and egregious conduct that 'shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety'.\"1562 According to the Claimant, international law requires that there be certain substantive due process guarantees for the determination of any controversy, which involve \"notice, the full opportunity to be heard, impartial consideration and reasoned judgment.\"1563 The Claimant notes that the tribunal in *Azinian v. Mexico* held that \"'clear and malicious misapplication of the law' constitutes denial of justice.\"1564\n\nReply, \u00b6 1153, *referring to International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v.

Ecuador* tribunal, the Claimant contends that this standard \"constitutes a *lex specialis* and [is] not a mere restatement of the law on denial of justice.\"1566 Rather, the Claimant submits, the \"effective means\" standard is \"a distinct and potentially less demanding test, in comparison to denial of justice in customary international law\" and may be breached by, *inter alia*, government interference in judicial proceedings, manifestly unjust decisions, and draconian legislation.1567 Proof of malicious intent, the Claimant adds, is not a requirement to prove a breach of the effective means standard.1568\n\nReply, \u00b6 1156. *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 67:4-11.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1162, *citing Chevron-Texaco v.

The defendants only had to establish the facts that the law could be applied to, and they did. The courts would have been able to, if they had done their job properly, to draw the key legal conclusions from title-bearing possession and breach of good faith. But these facts and evidence were wholly ignored.1580\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6 121 (**CER-8**).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 60:7-17.\n\n1000.\n\nUnder this rule, according to the Claimant, the courts should, of their own motion, have considered \"the obviously relevant law\" concerning the ELA subsidiaries' holding of \"title-bearing possession.\"1581\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 60:23-24.\n\n1001.\n\nThe Claimant contends that in further contravention of the *iura novit curia* rule, the courts failed to consider \"highly relevant and important evidence\" before them of contradictory behavior of the government in breach of good faith.1582 In particular, the Claimant contests that Estonian courts ignored a letter from the Office of the Chancellor of Justice of 23 October 1997, confirming that the 1992 Supreme Council Resolution had no retroactive effect, and the letter from the head of the Government Office of 8 November 1995.1583 The Claimant argues that under Estonian law, a court's failure to provide sound reasoning in respect of each of the parties' submissions of fact and law \"constitutes a serious violation of procedure.\"1584\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1419, 1422, 1465.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1419, 1422, *referring to* Third Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 123-125 (**CER-4**); Letter from the Advisor of Chancellor of Justice to B&E, 23 October 1997 (**C-331**); Letter from the State Chancellery to the Ministry of Justice, 8 November 1995 (**C-307**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 1422, *referring to* Third Keres Report, \u00b6 128 (**CER-4**).\n\n1002.\n\nAdditionally, the Claimant alleges that the courts of Estonia \"manifestly misinterpreted international law by failing to consider the *ex factis* rule in their determination of matters.\"1585 The Claimant's arguments on the application of the *ex factis* rule are set forth above (*see* paragraphs 407-410 above).\n\nReply, \u00b6 1430.\n\n1003.\n\nAlthough alleging that it is not a necessary condition for claiming denial of justice, the Claimant also notes that its subsidiaries exhausted all local remedies available in Estonia.1586\n\nReply, \u00b6 1466.\n\n*ii. The Respondent's Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n1004.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the \"Claimant attempts to package its disagreement with the decisions of the Estonian courts under two labels \u2013 briefly as denial of justice [\u2026] and mostly as a breach of the effective means requirement of the FET.\"1587 The Respondent denies both claims of breach in their entirety.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 409.\n\n1005.\n\nThe Respondent first submits that there was no denial of justice, which, it maintains, is a claim that is more appropriately addressed in the context of the Claimant's expropriation, instead of FET, claim.1588 Under the proper analysis of whether a judicial act resulted in the compensable taking of the Claimant's investment, as addressed in detail in Section VI.B.2 below, the Respondent submits, however, that there has been no compensable taking and, therefore, no denial of justice.1589\n\n*See* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 340-341.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 510-513.\n\n1006.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that it did not breach the effective means requirement of the FET standard in the Treaty. According to the Respondent, the purpose of this provision is \"to require the contracting parties to provide an effective system under which claims may be asserted and rights enforced.\"1590 In this regard, the Respondent emphasizes that there \"was no intent to undertake an obligation to assure that such system would be perfectly effective in every individual case, beyond the protection against a denial of justice.\"1591 In particular, the Respondent submits that the effective means standard \"cannot be used to lower the threshold necessary to find a denial of justice\" and \"deals with access of justice rather than with its administration.\"1592\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 411.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 411.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 413, *referring to Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, \u00b6 391 (**CLA-262**).\n\n1007.\n\nIn the instant case, the Respondent maintains that there was no breach of this standard because the Claimant and its subsidiaries \"were able to fully exercise their rights of defense and present their position in the judicial proceedings regarding the possession of the Seaplane Harbor buildings, effectively delaying the proceedings for years\", and \"were duly heard\" in respect of their claims in administrative proceedings against the PRCA General Plan.1593\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 412.\n\n1008.\n\nAs to the alleged errors of Estonian law, the Respondent denies the allegation that the 23 January 1992 Resolution was applied retroactively because the courts did not base their decision on the application of that resolution. The Respondent's position on this is set forth above (*see* paragraph 398 above).\n\n1009.\n\nTo the extent that the Claimant argues that the Estonian courts erred by failing to consider the concept of \"title-bearing possession,\" which the parties did not raise in the proceedings before the Estonian courts, the Respondent considers such argument belated and thus to be disregarded.1594 In any event, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has not cited authorities in support of the rule of *iura novit curia* under Estonian law and that \"title-bearing possession\" is not a concept of Estonian law.1595\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 12. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant's submissions are responsive to the Counter-Memorial, not the Rejoinder, and thus are outside the leave granted by the Tribunal on 30 August 2021. *See* 3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\n1010.\n\nIn relation to the alleged failure to consider the material and relevant evidence found in the letters of 8 November 1995 and 23 October 1997, the Respondent asserts that the ELA subsidiaries did not place reliance on that evidence in the Estonian proceedings, save only for a reference in the appeal of 25 July 2005.1596 The letters were relied on in that appeal only in relation to the question of retroactive application of the 23 January 1992 Resolution, and were not material to the case as claimed by the Claimant.1597 The allegedly ignored evidence was not relied upon in relation to the claims of legitimate expectations of ownership that the Claimant makes in this arbitration.1598 The Claimant's subsidiaries \"never proposed that the Respondent has acted in a contradictory manner and that it should be prevented from bringing the claim in the first place.\"1599\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 343, *citing* Petition for Appeal of Agrin, Verest and ELA Tolli, 25 July 2005, p. 10 (**C-043**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 343.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 344.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 113.\n\n1011.\n\nAs to the courts' alleged dereliction of a duty to consider bad faith, the Respondent submits that for such a duty to arise, \"the relevant evidence must be submitted and given the correct context.\"1600 Before the Estonian courts, the Claimant's subsidiaries \"did not rely on the Respondent's alleged bad faith behavior\" and \"never proposed that the Respondent has acted in a contradictory manner.\"1601 The argument should also fail because \"the Respondent has not acted in bad faith nor in a contradictory manner.\"1602\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 113.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 113.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 114.\n\n1012.\n\nAs to the application of the *ex factis* rule, the Respondent maintains that in the specific circumstances of the Soviet occupation in Estonia and the transactions on which the Claimant relies, \"it must be concluded that these transactions should not have been upheld by Estonia after the end of the Soviet occupation.\"1603\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 235.\n\n*iii. The Tribunal's Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n*(I.) Preliminary Issue: Timeliness*\n------------------------------------\n\n1013.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider as a preliminary matter the Respondent's procedural objection to certain of the Claimant's arguments. The Respondent objects to the Claimant's post-Rejoinder arguments on *iura novit curia* because these are allegedly responsive to the Respondent's Counter-Memorial and, therefore, outside the Tribunal's directions of 30 August 2021.1604\n\nRespondent's 3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6 10, *citing* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 277. The Tribunal directed that \"As regards points on Estonian law in the Rejoinder that were not already made in the Counter-Memorial, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to grant the Claimant the opportunity to respond before the oral hearing, including through the submission of a supplementary expert report by Mr. Keres. Any submission by the Claimant shall be limited to new issues of Estonian law raised for the first time by Respondent in its Rejoinder.\"\n\n1014.\n\nThe Respondent had mentioned in its Counter-Memorial the adversarial nature of Estonian court proceedings.1605 At that stage, the Respondent's position was that the judicial proceedings \"do not rise to the level of denial of justice and this has also not been argued by the Claimant.\"1606 Only in the Rejoinder did the Respondent discuss whether a denial of justice followed from the Estonian courts not applying *proprio motu* the principles of title-bearing possession and good faith in response to the expert evidence supporting the Claimant's Reply.1607 In light of the sequence of pleadings, the Tribunal adjudges the Claimant's post-Rejoinder submissions to fall within the permission given in its directions of 30 August 2021.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 277: \"It is also relevant that in the national court proceedings BPV never made the argument that its possession of the Seaplane Harbor buildings and structures was lawful because Agrin and Verest were 'title-bearing possessors.' The Estonian civil court proceedings are of adversarial nature and the court can rely in its argumentation only on the statements and submissions the parties have made.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 523. The non-articulation of the arguments in prior legal proceedings was cited as \"relevant\" in the context of the question whether the Claimant was a lawful possessor of the Seaplane Harbor\" and was not discussed in the context of denial of justice in that pleading.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 111-113. *See* Third Expert Report, \u00b6 242, stating that the principle of good faith \"is recognized and under *iura novit curia* its application is within the purview of the courts regardless of legal position advanced by either party.\" (**CER-4**); The Respondent stated *inter alia* that the arguments on title-bearing possession and good faith were \"invented by Mr. Keres solely for this arbitration.\" *See* Rejoinder, \u00b6 111.\n\n*(II.) Legal Standards*\n-----------------------\n\n*(A.) Denial of Justice*\n------------------------\n\n1015.\n\nThe Claimant makes its claim under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, which provides:\n\nInvestments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall be accorded full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than required by international law.\n\n1016.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the alleged \"denial of justice\" must be considered as an element of expropriation under Article III(1) of the Treaty as part of the Claimant's claim on expropriation. The Tribunal considers that the claim for denial of justice constitutes part of the alleged failure to provide \"fair and equitable treatment\" and the alleged treatment \"less than required by international law,\" as well as forming an element of a claim for expropriation, in relation to which Article III(1) of the Treaty requires compliance with \"due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(3).\" The alleged denial of justice forms an element of both the fair and equitable treatment and expropriation claims. The Tribunal will, therefore, consider the claim for denial of justice in relation to fair and equitable treatment in this section, as well as separately below in relation to the claim for expropriation (*see* Section VI.B).\n\n1017.\n\nWhile the Claimant attributes an \"abuse of process\" to the courts, it does not allege a denial of justice (or breach of the effective means requirement) through interference by other branches of government or insufficient legislation or unjust procedure, but only on the basis that the Tallinn City Court's 2005 judgment was flawed in its underlying reasoning. Accordingly, the Tribunal need not necessarily establish an overall, abstract standard for denial of justice, but only a specific one for this type of action.\n\n1018.\n\nWhere a \"denial of justice\" arises through allegedly flawed decision-making by an independent national judiciary, the error or irregularity concerned must reach a certain level of seriousness before it engages the responsibility of the State. The threshold of seriousness that must be met in this respect can be characterized in such terms as: \"clearly improper, discreditable or in shocking disregard of [municipal] law,\"1608 \"manifestly arbitrary or unfair,\"1609 \"a particularly serious shortcoming\" and egregious conduct that \"shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety\"1610 the administration of justice \"in a seriously inadequate\" way,1611 \"the clear and malicious misapplication of the law,\"1612 a substantive decision that is \"inexcusable, being one that no reasonably competent judge could make,\"1613 or \"extremely gross misconduct\" by the judiciary.\"1614\n\n*Mamidoil Jetoil Greek Petroleum Products Societe Anonyme S.A. v Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/24, Award, 30 May 2015, \u00b6 769 (**RLA-111**).\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v.

Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/25, Decision on Jurisdiction, Admissibility and Liability, 21 April 2015 (**RLA-207**).\n\n*(B.) Effective Means*\n----------------------\n\n1019.\n\nArticle II(7) of the Treaty provides:\n\nEach Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investment, investment agreements, and investment authorizations.\n\n1020.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the effective means requirement demands a demonstration of systemic failure (*AMTO*), whereas the Claimant submits that misconduct in the individual case is sufficient (*Chevron*).\n\n1021.\n\nOut of the awards that dealt with clauses similar to Article II(7) of the Treaty, the Respondent submits that the effective means requirement demands a demonstration of systemic failure as stated by the tribunal in *AMTO*, which found that \"[i]ndividual failures might be evidence of systematic inadequacies, but are not themselves a breach of [the effective means requirement],\"1615 whereas the Claimant submits that misconduct in the individual case is sufficient as stated by the tribunal in *Chevron v. Ecuador*, which found \"that it may directly examine individual cases under Article II(7).\"1616\n\n*Limited Liability Company Amto v Ukraine*, SCC Arbitration No. 080/2005, Award, 26 March 2008, \u00b6 88 (**CLA-348**).\n\n*Chevron-Texaco v. Ecuador*, Partial Award on the Merits, 30 March 2010, \u00b6 247 (**CLA-363**).\n\n1022.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on the statement in the *Duke* award that \"[s]uch provision guarantees the access to the courts\"1617 to argue that that tribunal held that only a systemic failure to guarantee judicial recourse violates the provision, not individual failures in the administration of justice.1618 However, no such general statement can be derived from the award. The tribunal did, in fact, go on to assess the circumstances of the individual case. In the same vein, the tribunal in *Petrobart*, although finding initially that the effective means requirement obliges the State \"to ensure that its domestic law provides effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights with respect to investments,\"1619 nevertheless went on to examine the specific case at hand and not just the legislation in general.\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, \u00b6 391 (**CLA-262**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 413.\n\n*Petrobart Limited v. Kyrgyz Republic*, ARB No. 126/2003, Arbitral Award, 29 March 2005, Chapter 8, p. 77 (**CLA-361**).\n\n1023.\n\nTo the Tribunal, the approach taken by the *Chevron* tribunal towards the examination of individual cases under the effective means requirement seems preferable. On the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Treaty, the denial to an individual investor of \"effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investment\" would constitute a breach of a \"right conferred or created by the Treaty with respect to an investment\" under Article VI(1)(C) of the Treaty. Moreover, the effective means provision of Article II(7) of the Treaty is located in the context of the other sections of Article II, all of which confer individual rights upon the investor. It would go against the spirit of conferring such individual rights if the investor had to show an across-the-board, systemic deficiency in the host State's legislation instead of just the misconduct concerning that specific investor.\n\n1024.\n\nThe positive wording of Article II(7) as an obligation rather than a prohibition indicates that any judicial recourse that falls short of being \"effective\" violates the Treaty.1620 This being said, such a shortcoming must be of a certain degree of seriousness in order to engage the responsibility of the State, being that the Tribunal must afford appropriate deference to the municipal courts in questions of municipal law. The Tribunal is not an appellate instance in charge of reviewing the domestic courts' decisions *de novo* as part of its analysis of whether the Respondent breached any of the US-Estonia BIT's substantive standards of protection.1621\n\n*See Chevron-Texaco v. Ecuador*, Partial Award on the Merits, 30 March 2010, \u00b6 244 (**CLA-363**).\n\n*Mamidoil Jetoil Greek Petroleum Products Societe SA v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/24, Award, 30 March 2015, \u00b6 768 (**RLA-111**); *Chevron-Texaco v.

Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/25, Decision on Jurisdiction, Admissibility and Liability, 21 April 2015, \u00b6 260 (**CLA-259**).\n\n1025.\n\nAccordingly, with regard to the review of domestic court judgments, it is proper for the standard of review under the effective means requirement to be informed by the decisions on denial of justice, in that it requires the reaching of a high threshold, such as for example conduct that is \"manifestly arbitrary or unfair,\"1622 subject to \"errors of a degree which no competent judge could reasonably have made\"1623 \"clearly improper, discreditable or in shocking disregard of [municipal] law,\"1624 or \"so insubstantial, or so bereft of a basis in law, that the judgments were in effect arbitrary or malicious, they simply cannot prevail.\"1625\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, Award, 26 January 2006, \u00b6 197 (**CLA-86**).\n\n*Mamidoil Jetoil Greek Petroleum Products Societe Anonyme S.A. v Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/24, Award, 30 March 2015, \u00b6 751 (**RLA-111**).\n\n*Mamidoil Jetoil Greek Petroleum Products Societe Anonyme S.A. v Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/24, Award, 30 March 2015, \u00b6 769 (**RLA-111**).\n\n*Azinian, Davitian, & Baca v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999, \u00b6 103 (**CLA-087**).\n\n1026.\n\nIn this manner, the denial of justice and the effective means requirement, as they apply to judicial decision-making in individual cases, overlap to a significant degree, as has been recognized in most of the cases relied upon by the Parties. The Tribunal will consider both of these standards in its assessment of each alleged breach.\n\n*(III.) Application of the Law to the Facts*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n*(A.) Allegation that the courts retroactively applied the 23 January 1992 Resolution*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1027.\n\nThe retroactive application of the 23 January 1992 Resolution in the manner alleged by the Claimant could potentially amount to a breach of Estonian principles of due process and legal certainty, should such retroactive application be established.\n\n1028.\n\nWith regard to the question of whether the Tallinn City Court actually applied this resolution, the Claimant simply states that it \"cited the 23 January 1992 Resolution, and hence it was applied.\"1626 The Respondent maintains that the 23 January 1992 Resolution was not applied by the courts and was not relevant to the Seaplane Harbor,1627 The Tribunal has thoroughly analyzed the reasoning of Tallinn City Court in the part on jurisdiction. The court found that the sale of the Seaplane Hangar and Berth No. 38 to GT and the sale of the lumber works site to B&E were void because they contravened Resolution 17 July 1990 and because those sales were never registered.1628 Hence, the Tribunal does not share the Claimant's view that the Tallinn City Court applied the 23 January 1992 Resolution retroactively.1629 In its judgment on appeal, the Tallinn Circuit Court endorsed the reasoning of the Tallinn City Court regarding questions of transitional law.1630\n\nC's 1 December 2021 submission, \u00b6 79.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 109.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 99(ii).\n\n*See supra \u00b6\u00b6* 507-549.\n\nJuly 2005 Judgment (**C-078**); March 2006 Appeal Judgment, pp. 38-42 (**C-081**).\n\n1029.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the claim that the Estonian courts committed a denial of justice or breach of the effective means requirement through retroactive application of the law.\n\n*(B.) Allegation that the courts systematically ignored relevant and material evidence*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1030.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Estonian courts deliberately ignored \"highly relevant and important evidence\" by failing to give weight to \"material and relevant evidence harmful to the position of the government and highly helpful to the position of the Claimant\" that the courts \"systematically\" ignored.1631 According to the Claimant, the two pieces of such evidence were the letter from the State Chancellery to the Ministry of Justice of 8 November 19951632 and the letter from the Advisor of Chancellor of Justice to B&E of 23 October 1997.1633\n\nReply, \u00b6 1456, *citing* Third Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 119-128 (**CER-4**). *See* \u00b6 124: \"The courts failed to consider several relevant and material documents from very senior parts of the government. These documents were the letter from the Office of the Chancellor of Justice [C-331] and the Letter from the head of the Government Office [C-307].\" *See also* \u00b6 130: \"The courts had the letter from the Chancellor of Justice before them, but failed not consider this highly relevant and important evidence.\" *See also* Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 59:22-60:11; p. 62:15-63:6.\n\nLetter from the State Chancellery to the Ministry of Justice, 8 November 1995 (**C-307**).\n\nLetter from the Advisor of Chancellor of Justice to B&E of 23 October 1997 (**C-331**).\n\n1031.\n\nThe Claimant introduced these letters into the proceedings with its Reply after the document production process. The Respondent notes that the only occasion on which the Claimant's subsidiaries brought up this evidence in the Estonian court proceedings was in the Petition for Appeal of the Claimant's subsidiaries against the July 2005 Judgment.1634 There, the Claimant's subsidiaries relied on those letters in the context of their argument that the 23 January 1992 Resolution did not have a retroactive effect.1635\n\nRejoinder \u00b6 343.\n\nPetition for Appeal of Agrin, Verest and ELA Tolli, 25 July 2005, p. 10 (**C-043**).\n\n1032.\n\nThe Tribunal must now consider whether the omission of the Tallinn Circuit Court to address the two letters in its reasoning was so manifestly or grossly unjust as to engage the international responsibility of the State.\n\n1033.\n\nAfter noting that the buildings claimed by B&E were not listed as public property in the relevant government documents, the letter dated 8 November 1995 continues as follows:\n\nA valid contract of purchase and sale can only be declared null and void by an action if requested by one party to the contract (an interested party).\n\nAt the moment of providing this opinion, the contract of purchase and sale for the buildings at 17 K\u00fcti St was valid, declaration of the contract null and void was not being heard by the court.\n\nThere are no further written documents at the disposal of the Government office which would enable providing a comprehensive response to the questions asked by you or form an opinion in the legal issues which you are interested in.\n\nIn connection with entry into force of the State Assets Act, the department for immovable property of government authorities has been reorganised into the immovable property department of the Government Office and its functions have changed significantly. The head of the department has been ordered to refrain from providing such opinions in the future.1636\n\nLetter from the State Chancellery to the Ministry of Justice, 8 November 1995, pp. 1-2 (**C-307**).\n\n1034.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the content of this letter seems fully compatible with the reasoning of the Estonian courts (analyzed by the Tribunal in detail above, especially in paragraphs 498-555). The letter states that (i) contracts, including Contract No. 16, can be declared void only by a court; (ii) no court actions are currently pending regarding Contract No. 16; (iii) the government office cannot provide a legal opinion on the legal issues B&E was interested in because of the lack of further written documents; and (iv) because of its changed function, the government office cannot provide similar opinions in the future.\n\n1035.\n\nThe one-paragraph letter dated 23 October 1997 clarifies that the 23 January 1992 Resolution does not have retroactive effect.\n\nAs assigned by the Chancellor of Justice I hereby clarify in response to questions posed in your letter that [23 January 1992 Resolution] did not possess retroactive effect. Said resolution cannot be relied on when requesting that transactions performed in 1990 be declared null and void.1637\n\nLetter from the Advisor of Chancellor of Justice to B&E, 23 October 1997 (**C-331**).\n\n1036.\n\nAs set out above, the Tribunal shares the Respondent's view that the Estonian courts did not apply the 23 January 1992 Resolution. And none of the two letters contradicts, in the view of the Tribunal, the reasoning and the findings of the Estonian courts. The Tribunal is not familiar with a legal system in which courts must weigh and consider every piece of evidence in their reasoning, especially if that evidence supports a legal proposition irrelevant to the outcome of the case. The Claimant has not argued otherwise.\n\n1037.\n\nConsidering the above, the Tribunal finds that the omission of the Tallinn Circuit Court to address the two letters in its reasoning is far from constituting manifestly or grossly unjust behavior that could give rise to a denial of justice or a breach of the effective means requirement. The Claimant states that the omission of the relevant evidence was a deliberate abuse.1638 The Tribunal finds no support for this proposition in the case record.\n\nTranscript Day 5, p. 69:6-70:8, 71:6-13.\n\n*(C.) Alleged failures to apply the principle of iura novit curia*\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1038.\n\nThe Tribunal turns next to the alleged obligation of the Estonian courts to apply legal rules that were not raised by the parties to the lawsuit. The Claimant's argument rests on the alleged obligation of the Estonian courts, under the doctrine of *iura novit curia,* to act on their own motion to identify and apply legal principles whether or not invoked by the parties*.* Under the rule as framed by Mr. Keres, the non-application of obviously relevant law would amount to a breach of Estonian law and a denial of justice.\n\n1039.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the rule is set out in section 436(7) of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that:\n\nIn making a judgment, the Court is not bound by the legal allegations made by the parties.1639\n\nClaimant Rejoinder Submission of 1 December 2021, \u00b6 46, *citing* section 436 of the 2006 Estonian Code of Civil Procedure (**C-603**).\n\n1040.\n\nAn older version of that code (which was in force from 22 April 1998 to 1 January 2006) contained what the Claimant calls a similar provision in section 228:\n\nWhen making a decision, the Court shall assess the evidence, decides which facts have been established, which law or other legal act shall be applied to the matter and whether the action is successful. If the matter comprises several claims, the Court shall make a decision with respect to each claim.1640\n\nClaimant Rejoinder Submission of 1 December 2021, \u00b6 47, *citing* section 228 of the 1998 Code of Civil Procedure (**CLA-184**).\n\n1041.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the alleged rule of *iura novit curia* is disputed by the Respondent, which submits that the Claimant has not cited legal support for this proposition.1641 The Respondent seems to accept to some extent the possibility of the courts considering legal rules *ex officio*, submitting that:\n\nFor the court to apply the [good faith] principle on its own, the relevant evidence must be submitted and given the correct context.1642\n\nRespondent Submission of 3 November 2021, \u00b6 9.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 113.\n\n1042.\n\nIn any event, assuming that such a rule would operate as put forward by Mr. Keres, it would require an \"obviously relevant law\" in light of the facts before the court. The threshold for a denial of justice or breach of effective means under international law is particularly high when it comes to the conduct of the judiciary, as apparent in the frequent use of intensified collocations such as \"clearly improper,\" \"manifestly arbitrary or unfair,\" \"particularly serious,\" \"in shocking disregard,\" and \"extremely gross\". To reach such a threshold, in the Tribunal's view, the domestic law concerned would have to have a correspondingly intense degree of obviousness and relevance.\n\n1043.\n\nAs regards \"title-bearing possession,\" the Tribunal notes that it has been a central point of contention between the Parties whether the concept of \"title-bearing possession\" even exists under Estonian law as a category different from lawful possession. The Parties had difficulties submitting case law and legal scholarship on that point. For this reason alone, the Tribunal is not persuaded that \"title-bearing possession\" was a point \"obviously relevant\" under Estonian law. Moreover, and as set out above, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Estonian courts have not applied this principle in substance, though not in name. In any event, as shown above, the Tribunal believes that a proper application of the principle of title-bearing (or rather, title-compliant) possession does not lead to a different result than that reached by the Estonian courts.\n\n1044.\n\nWith respect to the obligation to apply the principle of good faith due to the Respondent's earlier contradictory behavior, and again assuming that the rule of *iura novit curia* applies as contended by Mr. Keres, the Tribunal finds the Claimant's argument to be without merit. Mr. Keres posits that the rule required the defendants to \"establish the facts\" and the courts to \"draw the key legal conclusions.\"1643 As noted in the previous subsection, the Claimant's subsidiaries have submitted the letters dated 8 November 1995 and 23 October 1997 only in the appeals proceedings, they related to points of little or no relevance for the Estonian courts' reasoning. Given the content of these letters set out above, the Tribunal does not share the assessment that they, or any related arguments based on good faith, were \"obviously relevant\". Rather, the Tribunal shares the view of the Estonian courts that none of the Claimant's subsidiaries could acquire ownership in the relevant assets based on the principles of good faith applicable under Estonian law.1644 Furthermore, the Tribunal agrees with the Estonian courts that no different result is warranted because of the notions of title-bearing (or title-compliant) possession and of lawful possession under Estonian law.1645\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 60:7-17.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 550-554.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 587-604.\n\n1045.\n\nFor these reasons, the Estonian courts did not commit a denial of justice or a failure to provide effective means by omitting to consider *proprio motu* the rights of the ELA subsidiaries under the principles of \"title-bearing possession\" or of good faith.\n\n*(D.) Error of International Law*\n---------------------------------\n\n1046.\n\nTurning to the alleged error in the application of the rule *ex factis jus oritur,* the Tribunal recalls that it has determined, for the reasons set forth above (*see* paragraphs 460-555 above), that a proper application of the *ex factis* rule does not lead to a different result than that reached by the Estonian courts.1646 This being the Tribunal's assessment of the position under international law, the Claimant's argument that the Estonian courts erred in their application of the *ex factis* rule is rejected.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6\u00b6 460-555.\n\n*(E.) Conclusions*\n------------------\n\n1047.\n\nThe claims under the \"denial of justice\" standard as part of the FET obligation in Article II(3) and under the \"effective means requirement\" under Article II(7) both fail because the contested domestic court decisions did not err in law, whether \"manifestly\" or to any other degree (*see* paragraph 1018 above).\n\n**B. Article III of the Treaty: Expropriation**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1048.\n\nArticle III of the Treaty concerning expropriation provides:\n\n1. Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (\"expropriation\") except: for a public purpose; in a nondiscriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(3). Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier; be calculated in a freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market rate of exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation; be fully realizable; and be freely transferable.\n\n2. A national or company of either Party that asserts that all or part of its investment has been expropriated shall have a right to prompt review by the appropriate judicial or administrative authorities of the other Party to determine whether any such expropriation has occurred and, if so, whether such expropriation, and any associated compensation, conforms to the principles of international law.\n\n3. Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded treatment by such other Party no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the most favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.\n\n**1. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**a) The Claimant Held Rights Protected against Expropriation under Article III of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1049.\n\nThe Claimant, contrary to the Respondent's contention, submits that it held rights protected against expropriation under Article III of the Treaty.1647 The Claimant asserts that it owned BPV, Verest, and ELA Tolli, all companies incorporated in Estonia, and had a joint venture and profit-sharing agreement with Agrin, also an Estonian company.1648 The Claimant further claims that it had \"property rights owned by BPV arising from the leases with Verest and Agrin which were explicitly protected under Article I of the Treaty.\"1649 The Claimant submits that its rights over its Estonian subsidiaries, as well as over the assets held by them, constitute rights susceptible of being expropriated under the Treaty and Estonian law.1650\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1405-1414.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 359.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1387.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 359.\n\n1050.\n\nRecalling the arguments it made in response to the Respondent's jurisdictional objection (*see* Section V.B.1.c)ii above), the Claimant avers that, consistent with the expert opinion of Mr. Paul Keres, BPV, Verest and Agrin \"had lawful rights to possessory title at the Lennusadam Port\" as a matter of Estonian law.1651\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1405-1414.\n\n1051.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant maintains that \"it was a settled view that Estonia did not own the Lennusadam Port and that private parties did.\"1652 According to the Claimant, this is supported by \"key letters\" from the Estonian government, issued before the commencement of the lawsuit against Verest and Agrin,1653 and which, among other things, demonstrate that \"Estonia's conduct leading up to the litigation was consistent in that all arms of government regarded the Lennusadam Port and the buildings on the port lands as belonging to ELA USA's subsidiaries.\"1654\n\nReply, \u00b6 1410.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1409, *referring to* Third Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 206-210 (**CER-4**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 1408, *citing* Third Keres Report, \u00b6 205 (**CER-4**).\n\n1052.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that Article III of the Treaty sets forth a prohibition against expropriation that has not been undertaken \"for a public purpose; in a nondiscriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(3).\"1655\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 329.\n\n**b) Alleged Violation of Article III of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n*i. Interpretative Considerations of Article III*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1053.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Article III of the Treaty expressly provides that an expropriation may occur \"either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization.\"1656 The Claimant alleges that the indirect expropriation of an investment exists where the host State's conduct has had the effect of substantially depriving the investor of \"the economical use and enjoyment of its investments.\"1657 The assessment of a claim of indirect expropriation, the Claimant alleges, requires conducting \"an objective analysis of the facts of each case,\" including the nature of the investment and the government action at stake.1658\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 329.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 338, 343, *citing T\u00e9cnicas Medio ambientales, TECMED S.A. v.

In particular, the Claimant indicates that the tribunal in *Saipem v. Bangladesh* found that a national court's decision to *inter alia* revoke the authority of an arbitral tribunal and refuse to enforce an arbitration award was in breach of the expropriation provision of the treaty at issue.1659 The *Saipem v. Bangladesh* tribunal considered that the mentioned conduct by the respondent's judiciary was (i) \"a grossly unfair ruling\" that \"violated the internationally accepted principle of prohibition of abuse of rights\"; and (ii) \"was contrary to international law, in particular [\u2026] the New York Convention.\"1660\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 370, *referring to Saipem S.p.A. v.

The Respondent Unlawfully Expropriated the Claimant's Investments*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1056.\n\nThe Claimant submits that a scheme orchestrated by its executive branch, as well as the local lawsuits commenced by the Respondent against the Claimant's subsidiaries, resulted in the dispossession of the latter's property rights at the Seaplane Harbor, which amounted to an indirect expropriation of its investments in Estonia.1663 The Claimant alleges that the deprivation of the use and enjoyment of its investments \"became effective on June 7, 2006 when the Estonian Supreme Court refused to review the March 1, 2006 opinion of the Tallinn Circuit Court [of 4 July 2005], and was further effectuated by subsequent actions taken by Estonia to seize all assets of the ELA Estonian Subsidiaries.\"1664 According to the Claimant, the Respondent further deprived it of the use and enjoyment of its investments by initiating a civil action on 22 December 2006 seeking compensation from the Claimant's subsidiaries for their unjust enrichment from the occupation of the Seaplane Harbor without considering the capital investment put into the Seaplane Harbor.1665\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 362-376;

The Claimant contends that \"[m]any tribunals have determined that a state might have to pay for damages for actions taken under its police power.\"1691 For instance, the Claimant notes that the *TECMED v. Mexico* tribunal held that \"regulatory measures that fall within a state's police powers may nevertheless be expropriatory if the impact of such measures on foreign investment effectively neutralizes the value of investment.\"1692 In this regard, the Claimant argues that in the present case, \"the taking was substantial and total\" and was not justified by any public policy objectives.1693\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 1435.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1438, *referring to TECMED S.A. v.

Bangladesh*, the only case on which the Claimant relies, the tribunal held that \"refusal to enforce an international arbitration award was a violation of the expropriation standard not solely because it deprived the claimant of its rights but because the court decision constituted an abuse of rights and was illegal.\"1712 The Respondent underscores that *Saipem v. Bangladesh* must be distinguished from this arbitration given that in that case \"there was no dispute over whether the claimant actually had obtained the underlying property rights it claimed were expropriated.\"1713\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 506, *referring to Saipem S.p.A. v.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**a) Legal Standard**\n---------------------\n\n1078.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that a State may be responsible for the acts of its domestic judicial organs contrary to the suggestion by the Respondent that judicial acts cannot amount to expropriation.1726 An international tribunal called upon to rule on the State's compliance with an international treaty \"is not paralysed by the fact that the national courts have approved the relevant conduct of public officials.\"1727 This being said, it is equally well established that where an alleged taking occurs by operation of a municipal court decision on an issue of municipal law, an international arbitration is required to show deference to the municipal courts.1728\n\n*See* for example, *Saipem S.p.A. v. Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Award, 30 June 2009, \u00b6 149 (**CLA-200**); *Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v.

As the tribunal in Middle East Cement put it, \"normally a seizure and auction ordered by the national courts do not qualify as a taking\" unless \"they are not taken 'under due process of law.'\" \u2013 see *Garanti* at \u00b6 365 (**RLA-189**).\n\n1079.\n\nAs articulated by the tribunal in *Azinian,* a governmental authority \"cannot be faulted for acting in a manner validated by its courts unless the courts themselves are disavowed at the international level.\"1729 To establish unlawfulness at the international level, it would not suffice for an international tribunal simply to disagree with the determination of the municipal courts. There must be an irregularity of sufficient gravity (*see* Section VI.A.3.c)iii(II.) above), such as clear incompatibility with a rule of international law, undue influence from other State organs,1730 an abuse of rights,1731 a serious and fundamental impropriety in the legal process,1732 a denial of justice or a pretense of form,1733 or, in certain exceptional circumstances, a judicial decision contrary to municipal law.1734 The mere fact that a judicial decision is incorrect as a matter of municipal law does not suffice. The possibility of holding the state liable for judicial decisions does not entitle an investor \"to seek international review of the national court decisions as though the international jurisdiction seised has plenary appellate jurisdiction.\"1735 As stated by the tribunal in *Krederi Ltd. Ukraine* with specific reference to the judicial determination of property disputes:\n\nWhile it is possible that judicial action amounts to expropriation, it is the exception rather than the norm. In any kind of private law dispute over ownership of movable or immovable property, courts will make a decision which of the disputing parties claiming ownership rights prevails. This will result in a finding that one party will be entitled to ownership whereas the other (or others) will not. Such judicial determinations do not constitute expropriation. Similarly, where property transfers are held to be invalid, the resulting transfers of ownership do not amount to expropriation.1736\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, & Ellen Baca v.

Rights Capable of Expropriation*\n------------------------------------\n\n1081.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined in its rulings on jurisdiction *ratione materiae* that the rights of ownership and possession, which the Claimant claims were expropriated, were not validly held by the Claimant and therefore were not investments held by the Claimant within the meaning of the Treaty. This is, by reason of the findings of the Estonian courts, to the effect that the transactions by which the Claimant's subsidiaries acquired title were void *ab initio.* The result of the *ab initio* nullity of the alleged acquisition is that the Claimant, never having validly acquired title or title-bearing possession, did not hold the property rights which it claims were taken by the Respondent. Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the judicial decisions amounted to a \"taking\" of rights or property vested in the Claimant's subsidiaries, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant's expropriation claim fails for the reasons that follow below.\n\n*ii. Alleged Expropriation by the Executive*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1082.\n\nThe Claimant has alleged that the executive organs of the Estonian State conspired in a scheme to dispossess the ELA subsidiaries by unlawfully interfering with the court proceedings. A taking of property by the executive under the guise of court proceedings, through undue interference with the judicial process, could amount to an unlawful expropriation. The Tribunal has examined above whether the executive engaged in undue interference with the judicial proceedings and has found that no such undue interference has been established (*see* paragraph 991 above). The Claimant's claim that there was a \"scheme\" of the executive branch by which the Respondent carried out an expropriation is rejected.\n\n*iii. Alleged Expropriation by the Judiciary*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1083.\n\nAs to whether the court decisions in themselves constituted a violation of international law, it does not suffice for the Claimant to establish grounds for disagreeing with the courts' decisions, nor does it suffice to show that the decisions were incorrect as a matter of Estonian law. The courts' rulings would be in violation of international law only if grossly unfair, arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic at a fundamental and serious level.\n\n1084.\n\nIn *Saipem v. Bangladesh,* the tribunal did not engage in a full scrutiny of the domestic court judgment. Instead, the tribunal evaluated the court judgments on the basis of the conviction \"that international law requires state courts to abide by \"'generally accepted standards of the administration of justice' and that 'grossly unfair [\u2026] arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic' court rulings constitute a violation of international law\".1737 This is reminiscent of the high standard necessary to demonstrate a denial of justice. Here, for reasons that the Tribunal has considered in applying that standard, the Claimant has not established that there was any substantial error in the reasoning or decisions of the Tallinn City Court or Tallinn Circuit Court (*see* paragraph 1047 above).\n\n*Saipem S.p.A. v. Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Award, 30 June 2009, \u00b6 149 (**CLA-200**).\n\n1085.\n\nAs set out above, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the contention that the courts applied the 23 January 1992 Resolution \"retroactively.\"1738 Rather, the reasoning of the Tallinn City Court demonstrates that it relied on the 17 July 1990 Resolution and, as an additional and alternative ground, on the non-registration of the relevant transactions to declare them void.\n\n*Supra* \u00b6\u00b6 498-544, 1028.\n\n1086.\n\nConcerning the Claimant's complaint that the courts \"systematically\" ignored \"material and relevant evidence\" by failing to consider highly relevant letters from the Estonian government that supported its claim to the Seaplane Harbor.1739 The Claimant refers here only to the letter of 8 November 1995 and the letter of 23 October 1997.1740 It has not demonstrated significant reliance on these pieces of evidence before the Tallinn City and Circuit Courts, nor did it seek at that time to establish property rights on the basis of contrary behavior, bad faith, or legitimate expectations. The Tribunal again refers to its previous findings. The courts' treatment of the allegedly ignored evidence was not a denial of justice (*see* paragraph 1047 above).\n\nReply, \u00b6 1465, *referring to* Third Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 119-128 (**CER-4**).\n\nLetter from the State Chancellery to the Ministry of Justice, 8 November 1995 (**C-307**); Letter from the Advisor of Chancellor of Justice to B&E, 23 October 1997 (**C-331**).\n\n1087.\n\nIn relation to the alleged breach of the courts' duty to apply *proprio motu* the rules of \"title-bearing possession\" or contradictory behavior contrary to good faith, which would have led to a finding in favor of the ELA subsidiaries, the Tribunal has rejected the Claimant's arguments. In the Tribunal's view, the alleged rule of \"title-bearing possession\" cannot be described as a principle of \"obviously relevant law\" (*see* paragraph 1043 above). The alleged rule of contradictory behavior contrary to good faith was not relevant to the facts before the courts (*see* paragraph 1044 above).\n\n1088.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined, further, that there was no incompatibility with international law through non-application of the *ex factis* rule (*see* paragraph 1046 above).\n\n1089.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant has not shown any irregularity such as to justify a deviation from the general position of deference towards the Estonian courts on questions of Estonian law. As the Estonian court decisions merely applied the existing law and did so without undue influence by the executive or manifestly wrongful decision-making on the part of the judiciary, the judgments did not amount to a taking or expropriation. Therefore, the Claimant's claim fails, and it is not necessary to consider the conditions of lawfulness specified in Article III(1).\n\n**C. Article II(1) of the Treaty: MOST-Favored-Nation and National Treatment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1090.\n\nArticle II(1) of the Treaty provides:\n\nEach Party shall permit and treat investment, and activities associated therewith, on a basis no less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investment or associated activities of its own nationals or companies, or of nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the most favorable, subject to the right of each Party to make or maintain exceptions falling within one of the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Treaty. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party on its request of all such laws and regulations concerning the sectors or matters listed in the Annex. Moreover, each Party agrees to limit such exceptions to a minimum. Any future exception by either Party shall not apply to investment existing in that sector or matter at the time the exception becomes effective. The treatment accorded pursuant to any exceptions shall, unless specified otherwise in the Annex, be not less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments and associated activities of nationals or companies of any third country.\n\n**1. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**a) Analysis of \"Like Circumstances\"**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1091.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Article II(1) of the Treaty contains MFN treatment and NT clauses, which require Contracting Parties to afford \"no less favorable\" treatment than that accorded to nationals or companies of any third country and local investors, respectively, in \"like situations.\"1741\n\nReply, \u00b6 1276.\n\n1092.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in assessing whether the Respondent breached either of these obligations, the Tribunal should verify that (i) the Claimant and/or its investments are in \"like situations\" to certain domestic or foreign investors and/or their investments; and that (ii) the Claimant and/or its investments has been accorded \"less favorable treatment\" than those investors and/or investments.1742\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1300-1305, *referring to Bilcon, Clayton et al v.

It was sold to a Danish investor after the USSR ended their military occupation of Estonia.1767\n\n(d) The Paldiski North Port is a port that handles oversized cargoes, general and bulk cargoes, passenger cars, construction and agricultural equipment and freight equipment which was privatized in 1995. Although the port is currently owned by an Estonian company, in 2002 it was owned and controlled by a German company.1768\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 516; Reply, \u00b6 1369.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 511.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 511, *referring to* Juhan Tere, \"25 years from the beginning of the renovation of Kunda cement plant in Estonia\", 25 April 2016 (**C-048**); Port of Kunda website, About us, 20 August 2019 (**C-049**); Case Study 1: Kunda Nordic Tsement Ltd.

It has been owned and operated by BLRT Grupp since 2001. The Noblessner/Peetri Port was used by the USSR during their time of occupation in Estonia for military purposes and was privatized in 1995.1770\n\n(b) The Bekker Port is a commercial port owned by O\u00dc Tallinna Bekkeri Sadam. During the Soviet occupation the Bekker port was managed by RAS Balti Bas, a state-owned company. In 1994, 51% of the shares in RAS Balti Bas were acquired by an Estonian private company, the remainder 49% of the shares was held by the Ministry of Economy. In 1997, the Tallinn City Council introduced the proposal to municipalize 49% of the state-owned shares in O\u00dc Tallinna Bekkeri Sadam.1771\n\n(c) The Miiduranna Port is a mixed-use port facilitating cargo, fuel, and fish products, which has been owned by AS Miiduranna Sadam since 1991.1772\n\n(d) Port of Tallinn owns the majority interest in the Muuga Port, the biggest cargo harbor in Estonia.1773\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 519; Reply, \u00b6 1373.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 520, *referring to* Tallinn City Council Decision on Zoning of Ports, 7 October 1993 (**C-060**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 521, *referring to* Bekker Port Website (**C-114**); \"Review of O\u00dc Rasmusson's appeal in cassation regarding the initiation and adoption of the detailed plan and the contestation of the planning procedure operations\", 18 February 2002 (**C-115**); Chronicle of Bekker harbor conflict - Archive \u2013 Postimees, 14 January 1998 (**C-116**); \"The city wants port-based land, Oil transportation through the city\", Postimees, 5 March 1997 (**C-118**).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 522, *referring to* Miiduranna Sadam Website, Services Page (accessed 8-20-2019) (**C-119**); Antti Sarasmo, \"The Kirov fishing kolkhoz: A socialist success story\" in Competition in socialist society [electronic resource] /edited by Katalin Mikl\u00f3ssy and Melanie Ilic.

Administrative \"Blockade\"*\n-------------------------------\n\n1104.\n\nThe Claimant submits that all other ports operated without restriction on their customs operations between 1999 and 2006, while at the same time the Claimant's subsidiaries were not permitted to establish coordination of the port basin points or obtain a port passport, customs zone, or building permits.1777 Unlike the Claimant, other Port operators did not have to comply with the mandatory requirements of the 1997 Port Act.1778 In contrast to the actions taken in respect of the Seaplane Harbor, the Respondent paid compensation to O\u00dc Tallinna Bekkeri Sadam for the part of the Bekker Port that it nationalized.1779\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1369-1372.\n\nReply, \u00b6 1377, *referring to* The Port Act \u00a7 20

owners because the Claimant failed to prove its ownership, the Claimant's expert, Mr. Keres, asserts that the Claimant was entitled to the presumption of legality and lawfulness regarding its possession of the Seaplane Harbor as a matter of Estonian law.1780 Therefore, Mr. Keres states that the Claimant's investments of BPV and Verest were entitled to be treated like other port investments seeking government permits until such a time the court concluded otherwise.1781 Any actions taken by the Respondent contrary to the legal presumptions under Estonian law were in direct contravention of Estonian law and the rule of law.1782\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 31 (**CER-8**). *See* \u00b6 573 above.\n\nFourth Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 31 (**CER-8**).\n\nFourth Keres

Physical \"Blockade\"*\n------------------------\n\n1118.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the elimination of the railway link at the Seaplane Harbor is not evidence of preferential treatment of the Noblessner/Peetri Port because (i) the latter, unlike the Seaplane Harbor, is a shipyard that never operated as a cargo port and therefore was never in a \"like situation\"; and (ii) the non-removal of the railway leading to the Noblessner shipyard as opposed to the planned removal of the railway link to the Seaplane Harbor is easily understood and justified by the topology of railways in the area.1816\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 480-486, *referring to* Tallinn Master Plan, accepted on 11 February 1999, adopted on 11 February 1999, p. 3 (**R-124**).\n\n1119.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant was not discriminated against in respect of the berthing of the icebreaker *Suur T\u00f5ll* at the Seaplane Harbor because it \"was relocated for legitimate budgetary reasons, to a berth not covered by the Claimant's leases, and did not block the entrance to the port.\"1817\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 371. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 565-567.\n\n*ii. Administrative \"Blockade\"*\n-------------------------------\n\n1120.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant failed to obtain coordination of the Port basin points or authorization of a customs control zone because, unlike other ports, it was unable to show ownership or lawful possession of the land underlying the Seaplane Harbor or its basin.1818 The Respondent was under no obligation to \"ignore convincing *prima facie* evidence of the illegality of possession pending a final court decision.\"1819 The Respondent refutes the Claimant's argument that the presumption of lawfulness arising out of the Law of Property Act was to be applied in this case. In particular, the Respondent notes that sections 34(2) and 35(3) of the Law of Property Act place the burden of proof on the person contesting possession and does not require third parties to \"treat a possessor as a lawful possessor in all possible legal contexts until a judgment to the contrary.\"1820\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 490; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 591.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 488; 3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 17.

The Claimant failed to show that it was treated differently from others in relation to the granting of building permits because the Claimant never applied for any building permits.1821\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 491.\n\n**c) More Favorable Treatment Guarantee in Third-Party Treaties**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1122.\n\nThe Respondent's primary position is that the MFN clause in the US-Estonia BIT was designed to provide MFN treatment only in like situations, which the Claimant has failed to establish in this case.1822\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 499-501, *referring to \u0130\u00e7kale \u0130n\u015faat Limited \u015eirketi v.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**a) Legal Standard**\n---------------------\n\n1124.\n\nArticle II(1) of the Treaty provides:\n\nEach Party shall permit and treat investment, and activities associated therewith, on a basis no less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investment or associated activities of its own nationals or companies, or of nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the most favorable, subject to the right of each Party to make or maintain exceptions falling within one of the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Treaty. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party on its request of all such laws and regulations concerning the sectors or matters listed in the Annex. Moreover, each Party agrees to limit such exceptions to a minimum. Any future exception by either Party shall not apply to investment existing in that sector or matter at the time the exception becomes effective. The treatment accorded pursuant to any exceptions shall, unless specified otherwise in the Annex, be not less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments and associated activities of nationals or companies of any third country.\n\n1125.\n\nThe Annex to the US-Estonia BIT provides, in paragraph 3:\n\nThe Government of the Republic of Estonia reserves the right to make or maintain limited exceptions to national treatment, as provided in Article II, paragraph 1, in the sectors or matters it has indicated below:\n\nbanking, including loan and saving institutions; government grants; government insurance and loan programs; ownership of real property; use of land and natural resources; and initial acquisition from the Republic of Estonia and its municipalities of state and municipal property in the course of denationalization and privatization.\n\n*i. Like Situations*\n--------------------\n\n1126.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it appropriate to take the three-part approach, as adopted in the *UPS* and *Bilcon* cases,1825 in establishing whether there is a *prima facie* case of discrimination. The necessary elements are: (1) that a government accorded the investor or its investment treatment and that the same government accorded treatment to other domestic or foreign investors or investments; (2) that the treatment was less favorable than that accorded to other domestic or foreign proponents; and (3) the government accorded the allegedly discriminatory treatment in question in like situations.1826\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc.

Canada*, Jurisdiction and Merits Award, 17 March 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 717-720 (**CLA-082**).\n\n*United Parcel Service of America Inc. (UPS) v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award on the Merits, 24 May 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84, *referenced* in *Bilcon, Clayton et al v. Canada*, Jurisdiction and Merits Award, 17 March 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 717-720 (**CLA-082**).\n\n1127.\n\nWhile the MFN/NT provision uses the expression \"like situations\",1827 the Parties rightly attach the same meaning to this term as has been developed in relation to the term \"like circumstances\" in other investment treaties. The Tribunal notes, on the other hand, that definitions of \"like\" goods and services under international trade law pertain to *lex specialis* of a different order and do not require consideration here.1828\n\n*Occidental Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN 3467, Final Award, 1 July 2004, \u00b6 167 (**CLA-089**).\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009, \u00b6 389 (**RLA-142**); *Methanex Corporation v.

Argentina* as follows:\n\nIn order to determine whether treatment is discriminatory, it is necessary to compare the treatment challenged with the treatment of persons or things in a comparable situation. In economic matters the criterion of \"like situation\" or \"similarly-situated\" is widely followed because it requires the existence of some competitive relation between those situations compared that should not be distorted by the State's intervention against the protected foreigner.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe elements that are at the basis of likeness vary depending on the legal context in which the notion has to be applied and the specific circumstances of any individual case.1829\n\n*Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Liability of 27 December 2010, \u00b6 210 (**RLA-212**).\n\n1129.\n\nAs held in *Parkerings-Compagniet v. Lithuania*,1830 the situation of two investors \"will not be in *like circumstances* if a justification of the different treatment is established.\"1831\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS v Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007 (**CLA-123**).\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS v Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, \u00b6 375 (**CLA-123**).\n\n*ii. Establishing Less Favorable Treatment*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1130.\n\nTo determine whether a certain treatment was \"less favorable\" than another, the *UPS* test does not require a demonstration of discriminatory intent.1832 It would suffice to assume that the differential treatment was a result of the investor's nationality in the absence of evidence to the contrary.1833 This principle was supported in *Pope & Talbot:* \"Differences in treatment will presumptively violate Article 1102(2), unless they have a reasonable nexus to rational government policies that (1) do not distinguish, on their face or *de facto*, between foreign-owned and domestic companies, and (2) do not otherwise unduly undermine the investment liberalizing objectives of NAFTA.\"1834\n\n*Bilcon, Clayton et al v. Canada*, Jurisdiction and Merits Award, 17 March 2005, \u00b6 719 (**CLA-082**), *quoting Marvin Feldman v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, 16 December 2002, \u00b6 181.\n\n*Bilcon, Clayton et al v. Canada*, Jurisdiction and Merits Award, 17 March 2005, \u00b6 719 (**CLA-082**), *quoting Marvin Feldman v.

Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, 10 April 2001, \u00b6 78 (**CLA-205**).\n\n1131.\n\nThis view was endorsed by the Tribunal in *Bilcon*, which stated:\n\nConsistently with the approach taken in the *Feldman* case, however, the present Tribunal is also of the view that once a *prima facie* case is made out under the three-part *UPS* test, the onus is on the host state to show that a measure is still sustainable within the terms of Article 1102. It is the host state that is in a position to identify and substantiate the case, in terms of its own laws, policies and circumstances, that an apparently discriminatory measure is in fact compliant with the \"national treatment\" norm set out in Article 1102.1835\n\n*Bilcon, Clayton et al v. Canada*, Jurisdiction and Merits Award, 17 March 2005, \u00b6 723 (**CLA-082**).\n\n1132.\n\nIf the *UPS* criteria are fulfilled, the burden shifts to the host State to show the justification. The investor need not show discriminatory intent.\n\n*iii. Objective Justification*\n------------------------------\n\n1133.\n\nShould the Tribunal find that the three criteria in the *UPS* test are met, it would have to assess whether any differential treatment is justified.1836 As in *Pope & Talbot* and *Bilcon,* this Tribunal will apply the principle that if a *prima facie* case is made under that three-part test, there is latitude for a host state \"to pursue reasonable and non-discriminatory domestic policy objectives through appropriate measures even when there is an incidental and reasonably unavoidable burden on foreign enterprises.\"1837 In such cases, the burden is on the host state to identify and substantiate the case, in terms of its own laws, policies and circumstances, that the apparently discriminatory measure is an appropriate one taken in the pursuit of reasonable and non-discriminatory policy objectives.1838\n\n*See Bilcon, Clayton et al v. Canada*, Jurisdiction and Merits Award, 17 March 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 720-723 (**CLA-082**), *quoting Pope & Talbot v.

The Administrative \"Blockade\"*\n----------------------------------\n\n1134.\n\nThe Tribunal has found above (*see* Section VI.A.2.c)), that the Claimant failed to prove that the denial of the various administrative permits sought constituted an arbitrary or discriminatory measure. The Tribunal found instead that the Respondent's conduct during the administrative proceedings had a reasonable and justified basis.\n\n1135.\n\nWhile not arbitrarily or discriminatorily, the Tribunal must now examine whether the Claimant was treated unfavorably in comparison with investors \"in like situations\" in its pursuit of the necessary port basin approvals, port passport, customs authorization, and building permits.\n\n*ii. Investors in \"Like Situations\" for Purposes of Administrative Blockade*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1136.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that it was in \"like situations\" with the Noblessner/Peetri, Bekker, Muuga, Miiduranna, Kunda, Loksa, and Paldiski North Ports.1839\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 1311-1313.\n\n1137.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the Claimant is not required to show \"identical\" situations, but merely \"like\" ones.1840 The Claimant also argues that the Respondent's construction of \"like\" is too narrow and substantially corresponds with \"identical\" or \"most like\" circumstances.1841 In the Tribunal's view, the Respondent's definition of \"like\" is not the same as that of \"identical\" circumstances. Rather, the Respondent identifies the lack of valid ownership or possession as the principal factor that excludes the cited other investors from being comparators. As an additional factor, the Respondent also identifies the cultural significance of the Seaplane Hangar.1842\n\n*UPS v. Canada, Separate Statement of Dean Ronald A. Cass*, \u00b6 14 (**CLA-331**).\n\nReply, \u00b6 1335.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 594-595.\n\n1138.\n\nTo establish \"like circumstances\", the Claimant would therefore have to demonstrate that there was another port whose title was similarly contested. However, based on the Tribunal's previous findings under Section VI.A.2.c), the Claimant was not in \"like situations\" with the other ports because the underlying ownership dispute constituted a substantial element of distinction.\n\n1139.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal sets out below that, even if there had been other ports in like situations, there would nonetheless have been an objective justification for a different treatment under the MFN and NT standards.\n\n*iii. Objective Justification for Treatment of Disputed Possession*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1140.\n\nThe existence of an objective justification for a difference in treatment is a reason for not considering investors to be \"in like situations\".1843 In any event, it has been consistently found that different treatment that meets the three-part *UPS* criteria can be justified when the treatment has a reasonable nexus to a rational government policy.1844 Even accepting, for the sake of argument, that all subjects of the regulatory scheme for port, customs and building permits were in \"like situations\", in the view of the Tribunal, the difference in treatment where the relevant operations would be affected by an ownership dispute had a reasonable nexus to a rational government policy.\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS v Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 363, 375 (**CLA-123**).\n\n*Bilcon, Clayton et al v. Canada*, Jurisdiction and Merits Award, 17 March 2005, \u00b6 722 (**CLA-082**), *quoting Pope & Talbot v. Canada*, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, 10 April 2000, \u00b6 78 (**CLA-205**).\n\n1141.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that there was an objective basis for differentiation in the present case. The relevant port operations necessarily depended on rights of physical possession and use. It logically makes a difference whether operators hold rights of possession or not. For purposes of the regulatory scheme concerning transport and infrastructure, it was reasonable for the regulatory authorities to require that occupiers hold such rights. The Claimant was the only operator whose rights of ownership or possession were in dispute. The Respondent was under no obligation to disregard the dispute over title by treating the Claimant as if it were a lawful possessor for all purposes.\n\n1142.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent was under an obligation to disregard the ownership dispute on the basis of the presumption of lawfulness of possession under Estonian law. According to the Claimant, the fact that it was in possession of the port gave the Claimant the right to presumption of lawfulness of possession until determined to the contrary by a court:\n\nAny possessor is entitled to legal protection against interference with their possession and may rely on the presumption of the lawfulness (\u00a7 90 Law of Property Act), legality (\u00a7 34(2) Law of Property Act), and good faith (\u00a7 34(3) Law of Property Act) of their possession until the opposite is determined by a court. In the absence of a court determination to the contrary, Estonia was factually bound to respect ELA USA's subsidiaries as lawful possessors. Estonia could not take the law into its own hands and make determinations out of self-interest separately from the appropriate judicial proceedings.1845\n\n*See* Fourth Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28 (**CER-8**).\n\n1143.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"[o]nce there is possession, specific legal rights automatically arise. These rights include the right to deter any action against one's possession and interference in addition to that.\"1846 The Claimant asserts that \"Estonia could have approved BPV's port basin\" since BPV, Verest and Agrin \"presumptively had good possession of the Lennusadam Port arising from the fact of possession.\"1847\n\n1 December 2021 Submission, \u00b6 62.\n\n1 December 2021 Submission, \u00b6 73, *citing* Fourth Keres Report, \u00b6\u00b6 50(d), 57 (**CER-8**): in the absence of a court determination to the contrary, \"Estonia was factually bound to respect ELA USA's subsidiaries as lawful possessors. Estonia could not take the law into its own hands and make determinations out of self-interest separately from the appropriate judicial proceedings.*\"*\n\n1144.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant's reliance on the effect of possession. The property rights under Estonian law are set out in section 5 of the Law of Property Act and do not include possession. Possession is not a right but a description of a factual situation. According to the Respondent, sections 34(2) and 35(3) of the Law of Property Act stipulate that possession is deemed respectively lawful and in good faith \"until proven otherwise\". These provisions place the burden of proof on the person contesting possession. They do not say that everyone must treat a possessor as a lawful possessor in all possible legal contexts until a judgment to the contrary. There is no rule of Estonian or international law requiring the government to ignore convincing *prima facie* evidence of the illegality of possession pending a final court decision. The procedural presumption of lawfulness arising out of the Law of Property Act can be and was refuted.1848\n\n3 November 2021 Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 15-18.\n\n1145.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the origin of the transactions is at the core of the dispute between the Parties1849 and justifies categorically setting the Claimant's investment apart from those of the proposed national and foreign comparators. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant was not \"in like situations\" with the domestic investors in the Noblessner/Peetri, Bekker, Miiduranna, or Muuga Ports, nor with the foreign investors in the Kunda, Loksa, or Paldiski Ports.\n\nSee Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 473-474.\n\n*iv. Elimination of the Railway Link*\n-------------------------------------\n\n1146.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Noblessner/Peetri Port received better treatment in rail service and access than the Lennusadam Port. The Noblessner/Peetri Port is immediately adjacent to the Lennusadam Port and, like the Lennusadam Port, was subject to the Tallinn Master Plan and PRCA General Plan.1850\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 524; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 1373-1375.\n\n1147.\n\nThe Claimant claims that it received less favorable treatment because the railway connecting the Lennusadam Port was eliminated under municipal \"downzoning\", whereas the rail link of the neighboring Noblessner/Peetri rail link was not.1851 The Claimant alleges that the Respondent took regulatory steps as part of an \"economic blockade\" of the port \"to sever all rail line activity to the Lennusadam Port to make ELA U.S.A.'s business operations unviable.\"1852\n\nReply, \u00b6 1375.\n\nReply, \u00b6 58.\n\n*(I.) The Lennusadam Historic Railway Tracks*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n1148.\n\nThe historic railway links of the Lennusadam Port are shown in this image, from a 1946 map of the Noblessner Shipyard and Seaplane Harbor area:1853\n\nMap of the Noblessner Shipyard and the Seaplane Harbor area in 1946 (**R-019**).\n\n1149.\n\nThe historic track at the Seaplane Harbor was connected to a 4.2 km railway branch known as the Old City Harbor (Vanasadam) branch line, which linked it to Kopli cargo station.1854\n\nTallinn City Master Plan as on display as of 20 July 1999 (original) (**R-126**).\n\n1150.\n\nAs of December 1999, the Lennusadam Port site \"had the remains of demolished railway tracks, consisting of remains of rotten sleepers in the place of former railway branches, c. 30 of them, and two old rails.\"1855 The engineering consulting firm Ehitusekspert, commissioned by BPV to assess the assets on the site, reported as follows:\n\nThe plot is supplied with a railway line running from Tallinn railway station to the storage facility of the plot, with a jib crane KII-300 (1987, requires renovation). The railway line need[s] major repairs on the whole territory; the length of the line to rail switches i[s] about 500 m. see Annex no. 1, pp. 61, 62.1856\n\nLegal Instrument No. 28/2012, 20 December 1999 (**C-300**).\n\nEstonia's English Translation of the Ehitusekspert Expert Report, 24 January 2000, p. 32 (**R-021**).\n\n1151.\n\nOn 17 January 2000, Agrin recorded these remains of a railway as its own property because they were allegedly \"ownerless assets.\"1857 The Claimant then engaged a contractor to rebuild the old track and build two more. On 18 May 2000, BPV entered into an agreement with AS Eesti Raudtee (Estonian Railways), the owner of most railway branches in Tallinn, to connect the \"BPV's railroad\" to the Tallinn railway system.1858 The Claimant's activities to rehabilitate the railway were completed later in 2000.1859 The Claimant's Port Plan, dated 17 August 2000, envisaged that by the end of 2006, the Port \"will be able to take up to 100 rail trucks, unloading 40 rail trucks per day.\"1860 The railway track was operational between the end of 2000 and the end of 2004.\n\nLegal Instrument No. 29/1001, 17 January 2000, (**C-335**); *cf.* Reply \u00b6 700.\n\nContract between BPV and Estonian Railways, 18 May 2000 (**C-337**).\n\nReport of Inspection at Kuti 17, 28 August 2000 (**C-399**).\n\nPort Plan (**C-142**).\n\n*(II.) Elimination of the Vanasadam Branch Line*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1152.\n\nIn 1999, the City of Tallinn adopted plans for the formerly militarized and heavily industrial areas on the coast of the city to be redeveloped as a residential environment. These plans entailed changes to the uses of land and the transport infrastructure. The area of the Lennusadam Port was to be re-zoned from cargo and heavy industry to residential and recreational use. The Vanasadam branch line, along with any connections to the Seaplane Harbor, was to be removed within the next ten years.1861 The former railway link would then be rebuilt as a motorway known as the Kalamaja bypass.\n\nTallinn Master Plan, accepted on 11 February 1999, adopted on 11 January 2001, p. 4 (**R-124**).\n\n1153.\n\nThe Tallinn Master Plan, including the removal of the Old Harbor Railway link, was published in 1999.1862 The railway connections designated for elimination are shown in the following map, as displayed in 1999 (**R-130**):\n\nTallinn City Master Plan as on display as of 20 July 1999 (original), p. 10 (**R-126**); Plan of the railway network included in the Tallinn City Master Plan (**R-130**).\n\n1154.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2004, the Claimant's subsidiaries raised objections to the elimination of the railway link, which were heard by the municipal authorities in various meetings. The Claimant was not successful. The elimination of the railway link remained foreseen in the PRCA General Plan as adopted by Regulation No. 54 of the City Government on 9 December 2004.1863 The development of any commercial activities would have had to have been conditional upon the site being operated without a railway connection.1864\n\nTallinn City Council, Regulation No. 54, 9 December 2004 (**C-479**).\n\nExplanatory Note to the PRCA General Plan, p. 4 (**R-118**).\n\n1155.\n\nPreliminary work for removing the railway started in January 2005.1865 On 15 January 2005, BPV filed a complaint against the regulation of the city government adopting the Paljassaare and Russalka coastal area general plan.1866\n\n*See* Tallinn Administrative Court Decision in the complaints of Verest, BPV, Agrin against Harju County governor, 8 February 2005 (**C-507**).\n\nBPV complaint against Regulation No. 54 re. adoption of PRCA General Plan, 15 January 2005, 15 January 2005 (**C-504**).\n\n1156.\n\nOn 9 March 2005, the Tallinn Administrative Court issued its judgment in which it dismissed the complaint.1867 Among other reasons, the court found that the liquidation of the railway link was mandated already by the Tallinn Master Plan.1868\n\nAdministrative court decision in complaints of Verest, Agrin, BPV against Harju County Governor, 9 March 2005 (**C-508**); Reply \u00b6 777.\n\nAdministrative court decision in complaints of Verest, Agrin, BPV against Harju County Governor, 9 March 2005, pp. 11, 14-15 (**C-508**).\n\n1157.\n\nThe court ruled:\n\nBased on the aforementioned reasons, the statements about violating the legal certainty with the plan are unreasoned. The court has referenced the Tallinn general plan, which planned the elimination of the railway branch and the scheme confirming that was added to the materials of the matter, as well as creating the industrial park away from the city center. All circumstances have been considered in the plan and found that the concentrating of the industry to the planned area allows avoiding cargo transport through the city center. In addition, the existence of Kalamaja as the oldest urban neighborhood and cultural heritage next to industry is not reasoned, as the architectural heritage on this land area needs maintaining and protection. The complainant, making additional investments to bring the business plans to life, without taking into account the development plan foreseen with the general plan, took to bear the risk arising from it, which does not give a basis to request the changing of the plan.1869\n\nAdministrative court decision in complaints of Verest, Agrin, BPV against Harju County Governor, 9 March 2005, p. 16 (**C-508**).\n\n1158.\n\nThe decision of 9 March 2005 ended the prospects of maintaining railway access for the Lennusadam Port.\n\n*(III.)* The Noblessner Railway Link\n------------------------------------\n\n1159.\n\nThe connection of the Noblessner shipyard to the Tallinn Railway Network, as depicted in the Tallinn Master Plan, is illustrated here:1870\n\nTallinn Master Plan, accepted on 11 February 1999, adopted on 11 January 2001, p. 2 (**R-124**), annotated by Respondent and shown in Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 405, and Rejoinder, \u00b6 484.\n\n1160.\n\nThe Noblessner/Peetri Port never operated as a cargo port. It was used for ship repairs and as a shipyard for small boats, and its operations did not require railway access. Between 1991 and 2001, the shipyard operated as \"Tallinna Meretehas\" (*Tallinn Ship Factory* in Estonian). The Tallinn Ship Factory went bankrupt in 2001, and the port was bought by the BLRT Group, which continued using it for ship repairs until it was closed.1871 The ship repair and boatyard activities of the Noblessner/Peetri Port were not inconsistent with the aims of the Tallinn Master Plan as they did not involve heavy traffic or require a railway connection.1872 The site is no longer used for ship repairs and has since been developed as a residential/recreational area and a yacht harbor.1873\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 480.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 482.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 245.\n\n1161.\n\nUnlike the Lennusadam Port, the Noblessner/Peetri Port did not depend on the Old City Harbor (Vanasadam) branch line. The Noblessner/Peetri Port was connected to the national railway via the western section of the line running from the Balti station, which did not, in principle, conflict with the prospective Kalamaja bypass road.1874\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 484-485.\n\n1162.\n\nThe Respondent contends that since the Noblessner/Peetri Port did not require rail access via the Vanasadam branch line for access to the main rail network, nor did its operations require rail cargo services, the Noblessner/Peetri and Lennusadam Ports were not in \"like situations\" in respect of their respective railway links.1875\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 485-486.\n\n1163.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Lennusadam and Noblessner/Peetri Ports were not \"in like situations\" because the Noblessner/Peetri Port did not depend on a railway link that was designated for elimination by the Tallinn Master Plan. This fact, which forms an obvious basis for the different treatment of the Lennusadam and Noblessner/Peetri railway links, was not rebutted by the Claimant.\n\n1164.\n\nIndeed, as upheld by the Tallinn Administrative Court, the removal of the Vanasadam railway branch was a planning decision taken by the City of Tallinn within its discretion and with due regard to the publication and consultation procedures. The right of port operators to request that their interests be taken into consideration did not extend to a right of veto over the City's planning decisions. The Tallinn Administrative Court noted that planning policy decisions were not for the court to make. In the absence of a breach of due process or rules, as opposed to the reaching of an outcome with which the Claimant disagreed, there is no basis for a finding that the treatment of the Claimant's objections was not an objectively justified decision in the implementation of a reasonable government policy.\n\n*v. Alleged \"Blockade\" by Icebreaker Suur T\u00f5ll*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1165.\n\nThe Tribunal has found above (*see* Section VI.A.2.c)), that the Claimant has not proved that the berthing of the Icebreaker caused a physical block. The Tribunal has also found to be unsubstantiated the Claimant's allegations that the decision to move the Icebreaker lacked basis in legal right or was improperly motivated or that the berth was unsafe.\n\n1166.\n\nWhile not arbitrary or discriminatory, it could still be the case that the treatment of the Claimant through the relocation of the Icebreaker was less favorable than that of investors \"in like situations.\" The Tribunal observes, first of all, that the Icebreaker could only be berthed in one Port. It has not been suggested that the Icebreaker ought to have been placed in any one of the other Ports. On the contrary, the evidence demonstrates that the Seaplane Harbor was a reasonable choice. The Seaplane Harbor is designated as a cultural heritage site, as the location of the historic Seaplane Hangar. None of the Ports cited by the Claimant bears this feature. These are objective justifications for the Seaplane Harbor not to be considered in \"like situations\" with any other Port as a prospective location for the Icebreaker. For the reasons detailed above (*see* paragraph 1145 above), the difference in treatment was justified.\n\n*vi. The Reservation of Right to Make Exceptions under Paragraph 3 of the Annex to the Treaty*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1167.\n\nIt bears emphasis that the Respondent has not invoked the right to make exceptions under paragraph 3 of the Annex to the US-Estonia BIT, save \"in any event\" to counter the Claimant's claim that such reservation could be circumvented by way of the MFN clause in Article II(1) of the US-Estonia BIT. In these circumstances, the Tribunal would not be precluded from the reservation to the Annex to the US-Estonia BIT by reason of the time at which the Respondent's submissions were made.\n\n1168.\n\nAs a matter of law, the Claimant proposes that the provision in paragraph 3 of the Annex is \"subject to the Treaty\".1876 The Tribunal does not agree with this argument. Article II(1) states (emphasis added): \"Each Party shall permit and treat investment, and activities associated therewith, on a basis no less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investment or associated activities of its own nationals or companies, or of nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the most favorable, **subject to** the right of each Party to make or maintain exceptions falling within one of the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Treaty.\" Both the MFN requirement and national treatment requirement are \"subject to\" the reservations listed in the Annex to the US-Estonia BIT.\n\n1 October 2021 Submission, \u00b6 79.\n\n1169.\n\nAs a matter of fact, and for the reasons set out by the Tribunal above, the Claimant has not established that it was \"in like situations\" with any of the local investors allegedly afforded better treatment in respect of the Peetri/Noblessner, Bekker, Muuga, or Miiduranna Ports. As a result, there was no treatment in relation to which the Respondent needed to rely on the national treatment reservation. The Tribunal finds it unnecessary to engage in further consideration of paragraph 3 of the Annex to the US-Estonia BIT.\n\n1170.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant's claim under Article II(1) of the US-Estonia BIT is dismissed.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. The Costs of the Arbitration**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n1171.\n\nThe Claimant states that its costs in this arbitration are as follows:1877\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Item** | **Amount** |\n| Fees for legal representation and assistance Disbursements for legal counsel Expert fees and expenses Travel and other expenses of witnesses Costs advanced to the Registry1878 | USD 8,076,073.20 USD 112,256.69 USD 508,304.51 USD 1,388.98 USD 945,360.74 |\n| Additional claims Ancillary and other costs: extradition expenses Litigation financing costs | USD 651,649.18 USD 21,393,166.40 |\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6 30; Claimant's Response on Costs, IV.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n1177.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that its reasonable costs related to this arbitration are as follows:1889\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Travel and other expenses of witnesses | 0.00 |\n| Miscellaneous costs | EUR 26,541.00 |\n| Arbitration costs advanced to the Registry | EUR 850,000.00 |\n| TOTAL | EUR 2,106,532.00 |\n\nRespondent's Cost Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\n1178.\n\nThe total costs claimed by the Respondent are EUR 2,106,532.00.1890\n\nRespondent's Cost Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 2 and 16(1).\n\n1179.\n\nThe Respondent claims interest on legal costs \"at a 6-month average EURIBOR + 2%, or at any other rate the Tribunal deems appropriate, per year calculated on a simple basis from the date of the award on costs until the date of full and final payment.\"1891\n\nRespondent's Cost Submission, \u00b6 16(2).\n\n1180.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that the extradition expenses claimed by the Claimant were costs of the arbitration for which reimbursement can be requested under the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules because the costs of U.S. court proceedings are best dealt with in that forum under the specific procedural rules applying the principle articulated by the tribunal in *British Caribbean Bank v Belize* that \"as a general matter, the costs of a proceeding in a particular forum are most appropriately assessed by that forum.\"1892 The Respondent adds that the Claimant's extradition costs are \"wholly unsubstantiated with invoices.\"1893\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, *citing British Caribbean Bank v Belize,* \u00b6 326 (**RLA-233**).\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 23.\n\n1181.\n\nThe Respondent claims that the Claimant's costs of legal representation and assistance were not reasonable because (i) the Claimant's figures exceed the average and median costs of submissions for investors;1894 (ii) there is a \"huge disparity\" in the hours worked by counsel in the case, being 14,000 hours for the Claimant compared with 3,788 hours for the Respondent's counsel;1895 (iii) any additional complexity or novelty would affect both parties equally and does not explain the disproportion,1896 and (iv) the only costs of legal representation that can be deemed reasonable, if any, are those that have been paid.1897\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 8.\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 9.\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 11.\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 13.\n\n1182.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute the general reasonableness of the Claimant's costs of expert witnesses, with the exception of \"the alleged witness statement by an Estonian attorney Leho Pihkva.\" The Claimant's costs submission states that \"Leho Pihkva, an Estonian Attorney at the Glimstedt law firm, provided Estonian legal advice. He was paid US$ 2,877.89.\"1898 The Respondent's objection is that \"no such person has been called as an expert by the Claimant in these proceedings.\"1899\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6 45(c).\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 16.\n\n1183.\n\nThe Respondent states that the Claimant has failed to submit the relevant invoices to substantiate its costs.1900 The Respondent particularizes this objection by reference to the following invoices of Mr. Paul Keres: (i) Invoice No. 2200007 for EUR 14,907.00 is \"nowhere to be found;\"1901 and Invoice No. 1901500 for EUR 9,598.81 submitted in Exhibit C-Costs-2 \"relates to the extradition proceedings as per its description.\"1902\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 17.\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 17.\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 17.\n\n1184.\n\nThe Respondent does not contest the reasonableness of the Claimant's witness costs or its payments to the PCA.1903\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 18.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1185.\n\nAs set out in Articles 38 and 40 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal must first fix the costs of the arbitration before apportioning those costs between the Parties.\n\n1186.\n\nArticle 38 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules reads as follows:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\n1187.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the costs of this arbitration in the order set out in this provision.\n\n1188.\n\nThe fees of the Tribunal, stated separately as to each arbitrator (as provided by Article 38(a) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules), are as follows:\n\n(a) Judge Tomka EUR 258,212.50\n\n(b) Prof. Ruiz Fabri EUR 197,973.90\n\n(c) Judge Simma (incl. VAT) EUR 702,394.24\n\n1189.\n\nThe travel and other expenses of the arbitrators (under Article 38(b) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules) amount to EUR 1,914.25.\n\n1190.\n\nAs regards costs mentioned in Article 38(c) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal required the following assistance:\n\n(a) PCA fees and expenses EUR 174,493.61\n\n(b) Fees and expenses of the Assistants to the Tribunal (incl. VAT) EUR 367,215.20\n\n(c) PCA disbursements for the Hearing and other expenses EUR 43,536.00\n\n1191.\n\nThe travel and other expenses of the witnesses (that is, of Mr. Rotko and Ms. Kotova) amount to USD 1,388.98 and are approved by the Tribunal under Article 38(d) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n1192.\n\nAccording to Article 38(e) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, the costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party form part of the costs of arbitration if the amount of such costs is reasonable. The costs for legal representation and assistance of the unsuccessful party are not part of the costs to be fixed by the Tribunal. The wording of Article 38 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules is clear in this regard. The second sentence of this provision clarifies that the list of relevant costs in paragraphs (a) to (f) is exhaustive. Paragraph (e) is limited to the costs of the successful party and none of the other paragraphs covers the costs for legal representation and assistance of the unsuccessful party. Jurisprudence on file confirms this account.1904 The Respondent is the successful party in this arbitration, given that the Tribunal determined that the Respondent did not breach the US-Estonia BIT. While the Claimant has in parts prevailed on jurisdiction, the Tribunal has rejected all claims of the Claimant on the merits.\n\nE.g. *Mohamed Abdel Raouf Bahgat v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, Final Award, 23 December 2019, \u00b6 584 (**CLA-410**); *Maya Dangelas (Dang Thi Hoang Yen), U.S. Global Institute, Inc. and Angels Company, Inc. v. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam*, Corrected Partial Award on Costs \u2013 Jurisdiction, 9 March 2022, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 35 (**RLA-230**).\n\n1193.\n\nThe Tribunal must next assess whether the amount of costs for legal representation and assistance claimed by the Respondent under Article 38(e) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules is reasonable. Considering the procedural and substantive complexities of this arbitration, the Tribunal finds that the amount claimed by the Respondent\u2014that, is EUR 1,256,532.001905\u2014is reasonable. By way of comparison, the Claimant claims USD 8,076,073.20 million in costs for legal representation (without the costs for extradition expenses, disbursements for legal counsel, and expert fees and disbursements).1906 USD 2,796,379.46 (that is, roughly 35%) of this amount have been paid and the rest (that is, USD 5,279,693.74) is owed to Claimant's counsel, Appleton & Associates LP and Reed Smith LLP.1907 The Claimant states that an additional amount of more than USD 21 million is contractually due to the Funder.1908 As the Claimant is the unsuccessful Party, these sums are not part of the costs of arbitration under Article 38 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Cost. But the size of these amounts underlines the complexity of the matter and the reasonableness of the costs claimed by the Respondent under Article 38(e) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules.\n\nThis sum is composed of EUR 797,782.00 in fees for legal representation and assistance, EUR 432,209.00 in expert fees and expenses, and EUR 26,541.00 in miscellaneous costs such as research and printing expenses, Respondent's Cost Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\n*See supra* \u00b6 1171.\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6 30.\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6 30. The exact amount is USD 21,393,166.40.\n\n1194.\n\nIn accordance with Article 38 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal fixes the costs of the arbitration as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Item** | **Amount** |\n|  |  |\n| (a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal, stated separately as to each arbitrator: |  |\n| \u2022 Judge Tomka | EUR 258,212.50 |\n| \u2022 Prof. Ruiz Fabri | EUR 197,973.90 |\n| \u2022 Judge Simma (incl. VAT) | EUR 702,394.24 |\n| (b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators; | EUR 1,914.25 |\n| (c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal: |  |\n| \u2022 PCA fees and expenses | EUR 174,493.61 |\n| \u2022 Fees and expenses of the Assistants to the Tribunal (incl. VAT) | EUR 367,215.20 |\n| \u2022 PCA disbursements for the Hearing and other expenses (incl. court reporting, interpretation, IT/AV, printing and supplies, bank costs, courier expenses, etc.) | EUR 43,536.00 |\n| (d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses | USD 1,388.98 |\n| (e) The successful Party's (that is, the Respondent's) costs for legal representation and assistance1909 | EUR 1,256,532.00 |\n| **TOTAL** | EUR 3,002,271.70 and USD 1,388.98 |\n\nExcludes PCA deposit.\n\n1195.\n\nIn accordance with Article 41 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, a tribunal may request the parties to make deposits as advances for the Tribunal's fees and expenses. In these proceedings, the Parties deposited a total amount of EUR 1,770,000.00, each Party having deposited EUR 885,000.\n\n1196.\n\nBased on the above figures, the costs comprising the items covered in Article 38(a) to (c) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, total EUR 1,745,739.70. After payment of these costs from the deposit, an unexpended balance of EUR 24,260.30 remains. In accordance with Article 41(5) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, the PCA shall return EUR 12,130.15 to each Party.\n\n**B. Apportionment of the Costs of the Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n1197.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it should be awarded costs (1) under the presumption of loser pays if it is successful and also (2) on the basis of Tribunal discretion to apportion costs in any event.1910 The Claimant asserts that it should not bear Estonia's arbitration or representation costs,1911 and should \"in any event\" be awarded costs for \"those specific instances in which Estonia's conduct and argumentation caused Claimant to incur unwarranted and voidable additional costs.\"1912\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6 41.\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6 41; Claimant's Response on Costs, \u00b6 15.\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6 41.\n\n1198.\n\nThe Claimant states that if it is unsuccessful in this arbitration, the Claimant should not bear Estonia's arbitration or representation costs.1913\n\nClaimant's Response on Costs, \u00b6 15.\n\n1199.\n\nThe Claimant states that several claims were novel and raised issues of first impression;1914 and its claims were made reasonably and in good faith.1915 There was no unreasonable or wasteful conduct on Claimant's part, whereas Estonia's conduct of the proceedings caused delay and additional work.1916 The Claimant also refers to the particular egregiousness of the Respondent's conduct as alleged, in the form of abuse of human rights, reliance on coerced evidence, arbitrary detention and extortion, unjust extradition and retaliation.1917 The Claimant further refers to certain especially egregious aspects of the Respondent's allegedly unlawful treatment of the Claimant's investment, namely, systemic disinformation, discriminatory practices, stealing property rights of the investments, conspiring to hide information, and a campaign to \"demean and disparage\" the Claimant.1918\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 34, 42-43.\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6 35.\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6 35.\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 36-38.\n\nClaimant Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n1200.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant should bear the costs of legal representation \"regardless of the outcome of the case.\"1919 According to the Respondent, \"the fact that issues are complex and novel, etc. affects the parties similarly.\"1920 The Claimant's arguments on the Respondent's alleged human rights abuses and unlawful conduct reflect the merits of the case and should be disregarded.1921 The behavior of the parties in conducting the case should be taken into account, and it was the Claimant's actions that added to the costs in \"making unsolicited requests and submissions\"1922 and causing delays.1923\n\nRespondent Submission on Costs \u00b6 14; Respondent Response Cost Submission, \u00b6 28.\n\nRespondent Response Cost Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\nRespondent Response Submission on Costs, \u00b6 27.\n\nRespondent Response Cost Submission, \u00b6 29.\n\nRespondent Response Cost Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1201.\n\nArticle 40 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n1202.\n\nThe costs of arbitration (save for legal representation and assistance) \"shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party\". There is no presumption in respect of the costs of legal representation and assistance.\n\n1203.\n\nThe in-principle presumption stated in Article 40(1) does not mean automatic recovery by the successful party, as the Respondent has emphasized.1924 The Tribunal, in any event, has discretion to apportion the costs of arbitration between the Parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\nRespondent's Response on Costs, \u00b6 12, *citing Naftogaz and others v. Russia*, PCA Case No. 2017-16, Final Award, 12 April 2023 (**RLA-232**).\n\n1204.\n\nIn the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal considers that it is reasonable to order that each Party bear in equal shares the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the other costs referenced in Article 40(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules and that each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings. The circumstances that the Tribunal considers relevant are as follows.\n\n1205.\n\nIt is clear that the Claimant genuinely perceived that it had been treated unfairly and, prior to its arbitration claim, pursued redress for such treatment at the material times through appropriate avenues, including before the Estonian courts and the European Court of Human Rights. It took significant financial commitments over a period spanning more than a decade for the Claimant to pursue those avenues and secure the means to bring the present claim. The Tribunal accordingly finds that the Claimant acted in good faith in bringing its claims in this arbitration.\n\n1206.\n\nRelatedly, the Tribunal finds that the present case was not frivolous or vexatious, but rather, it presented serious and complex issues. The Claimant has emerged as the \"unsuccessful party\" only after the hearing of extensive evidence and submissions and the Tribunal's close examination of complex and novel issues. The Respondent has not contested the novelty or complexity of the issues involved in this case but rather acknowledges \"[t]he fact that issues are complex and novel, etc.\" while stating that such complexities \"affect the parties similarly.\"1925\n\nRespondent's Response Submission on Costs, \u00b6 11.\n\n1207.\n\nAs to the conduct of the proceedings, the Tribunal notes that the Parties, and the counsel and others assisting them, behaved with all of the appropriate professionalism, seriousness, and efficiency. The Tribunal does not find the manner in which the case was conducted to warrant that either Party bears more than its own costs.\n\n1208.\n\nThe Claimant has pointed to the particular egregiousness of the allegedly unlawful conduct. The Tribunal has not upheld any of the claims for alleged breaches of the US-Estonia BIT. Since the apportionment of costs would not be an appropriate avenue for the Tribunal to revisit its decision on the merits of the claim, and in the absence of a finding of liability, it is not appropriate to apportion costs in favor of the Claimant on this basis.\n\n1209.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, each Party having sought an award of costs \"in any event,\" the Tribunal notes the Claimant's contention that even if unsuccessful, it should be allocated an award of costs against the Respondent. In the Tribunal's view, the circumstances do not warrant an adverse order of costs against the Respondent.\n\n1210.\n\nIn light of the above circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the Parties should bear in equal shares the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA and other costs (Article 38(a) to (c) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules), and that each Party shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings (Article 38(d) and (e) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules). Having so decided, the Tribunal does not need to make an award of interest.\n\n**VIII. DISPOSITIF**\n--------------------\n\n1211.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal **DECIDES** as follows:\n\n(a) The Tribunal rejects the Respondent's jurisdictional objections and sees no reason to refrain from exercising its jurisdiction in the present case.\n\n(b) The Tribunal decides that the Claimant's pleaded claims are admissible and may be decided by the Tribunal in this arbitration on their factual and legal merits under the Treaty.\n\n(c) The Tribunal rejects the Claimant's claims that the Respondent has acted in a manner inconsistent with its obligations under Articles II and III of the Treaty.\n\n(d) The Claimant's claims are accordingly dismissed in their entirety.\n\n(e) The Tribunal fixes the costs of the arbitration at EUR 3,002,271.70 and USD 1,388.98.\n\n(f) The Parties shall bear in equal shares the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, as well as the costs of assistance required by the Tribunal and other expenses (incl. court reporting, interpretation, IT/AV, printing and supplies, bank costs, courier expenses, etc.).\n\n(g) Each Party shall bear its own costs for legal representation and assistance.\n\n(h) Any claim, request or defense of either Party that has not been expressly accepted in this Section VIII is hereby dismissed.\n\nPlace of Arbitration: Geneva, Switzerland\n\nDate: 21 February 2025"}]}
